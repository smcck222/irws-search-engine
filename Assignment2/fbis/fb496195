  [Text] Argument To Lift Ban on Holding Companies 
Resurfaces--Federal Trade Commission Alleges "Threat to 
Antimonopoly Law" and Faces Difficult Decision 
  Debate has resurfaced on the holding company concept banned 
by the Antimonopoly Law. The reason is that the business world, 
which advocates lifting the ban, has involved foreign firms in 
its tactics by using the logic that "the change is necessary to 
encourage direct foreign capital investment in Japan." It is 
said that, foreign firms of Europe and the United States are 
voicing strong sentiments that "we would like to establish 
holding companies in Japan and launch operations in different 
industries." The business world is stepping up its movements in 
such a direction with the help of foreign firms, and it appears 
that the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] will be facing the 
situation where it will have to make some difficult decisions. 
  At the beginning of this month Keidanren [Japan Federation 
of 
Economic Organizations] compiled and presented an emergency 
recommendation package to the Management and Coordination Agency 
[MCA] saying, "We should revise section 9 of the Antimonopoly 
Law." The recommendation package includes plans for encouraging 
direct investment in Japan by foreign firms, but a major 
provision of the plan includes lifting the ban on holding 
companies which is stipulated in section 9 of the Antimonopoly 
Law. On the 24th, in a meeting at which Keidanren and the MCA 
exchanged opinions, Isao Nakauchi, Keidanren vice president and 
chairman and president of Daiei, restated the request to 
Director General Ishida for approval of the recommendation 
package. 
<H5>  Keidanren Assumes Aggressive Stance </H5>
  A holding company owns stock in a firm to control the 
latter's operations, but the Antimonopoly Law prohibits such 
ownership with the belief that it allows for specific firms to 
control markets and restrain competition. However, holding 
companies provide the advantage of maneuverability in business 
operations. The reason is that holding companies can serve as 
command posts whence decisions can be made to spin off promising 
operations to form strategic subsidiaries, while facilitating 
the consolidation of companies whose operations are not 
promising. 
  Holding companies are sanctioned in Europe and the United 
States. According to Keidanren, European and U.S. firms and 
firms owned by foreign interests have displayed increasing 
interest in "establishing holding companies in Japan and 
engaging in a variety of business operations." Concurrently, 
increasing discontent is voiced in comments such as "holding 
companies are authorized in our homeland, but why is it that 
they are not allowed in Japan?" 
  Keidanren, on a mid- and long-range basis, is endeavoring to 
cultivate a scenario in which the holding company ban will be 
lifted. In the current form in which financial institutions own 
100 percent of subsidiary companies, there is not adequate 
provision for entry into other business forms and the financial 
industry plans to present the holding company format as a new 
approach. Industry as a whole plans to use a strategy of timing 
its argument that "it would be illogical to allow holding 
companies in the financial industry only" so it coincides with 
the broaching of the issue by the financial industry and thus 
seek equal treatment for industry as a whole. Although there is 
strong resistance to changing the law, Keidanren plans on a 
lengthy but persistent strategy. 
<H5>  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry Also </H5>
Lobbies for Change 
  This is not the first time that the business world has 
lobbied for a lifting of the ban. Controversy over the issue was 
also generated in the latter half of the 1960's, when the tide 
for deregulating capital movement approached and there was a cry 
for shoring up the competitiveness of domestic firms. As 
recently as October 1992, the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association 
of Corporate Executives] called for lifting the ban in a package 
of recommendations on corporate legislation. 
  A common characteristic found in corporate arguments for 
lifting the ban is that "holding companies will enhance 
management efficiency and be useful in shoring up 
competitiveness." Generally speaking, expanding organizational 
structures tends to detract from rapid dissemination of 
information and the decisionmaking process and lowers 
efficiency. The proposed lifting of the ban envisions the 
breakout of operating divisions into subsidiaries to improve 
efficiency and to use such changes to enhance operations of the 
group as a whole. 
  In response to such positions taken by the business world, 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has 
begun to negotiate with the FTC. In November 1993, the 
Industrial Structural Council, a MITI advisory organ, issued an 
intermediate recommendation calling for a revision of the 
regulations on holding companies as a means to facilitate 
restructuring of businesses. MITI has arrived at the conclusion 
that competition among subsidiaries of various holding companies 
which succeed in attaining efficiency, will revitalize the 
Japanese economy. 
  In response to such assertions, the FTC shows no sign of 
changing its position, as stated by commission chairman Masami 
Kogayu: "The holding company concept undermines the basic 
concepts of the Antimonopoly Law and we have no intent of 
approving the proposed changes." If holding companies are 
recognized, it will lead to the creation of powerful corporate 
groups that exercise strong control over markets and would pose 
the risk of excluding new market entrants. There is the strong 
sense of crisis that competition would be restrained and the 
overall efficiency of the economy would be undermined. 
  On the other hand, Japanese corporate holdings of outside 
firms are relatively high and, as can be seen among corporate 
groups, interlocking ownership of stocks is widespread. 
Commission chairman Kogayu says that "corporate groups would be 
stronger" if holding companies were sanctioned under such 
conditions. He fears that the result may be an exacerbation of 
distrust by foreign nations, including the United States which 
asserts that "Japanese markets are exclusionary." 
<H5>  Debate Lacks Meeting of Minds </H5>
  At present there is no meeting of the minds in the debate 
between the business world and the FTC. FTC officials rebut 
arguments to lift the ban as a means of promoting foreign 
capital investment in Japan by commenting, "It would not be fair 
to sanction holding companies for foreign capital only. If they 
are to be approved, they should be authorized for Japanese firms 
as well, but that is impossible." 
  However, "external pressure" is about to become a lever in 
the business world's drive for lifting of the ban and the debate 
concerning holding companies appears to be headed for a higher 
level of intensity.

<F P=106> [Article by Katsumi Hoshino, professor of Tama University: </F>
"The Potential for New Industries Based on the Anticipated 
Consumer Culture"] 
  [Text] Automobiles, televisions, and refrigerators, 
products which have constituted the focus of 20th century 
industry, have reached consumption saturation. It is said that 
industry enters a period of change from the new to the old in 
increments of 100 years, but how will new industries linked to 
the 21st century differ? Twelve trends are examined. 
  Today, at the end of the 20th century, the root causes of 
the 
extended major business slump are the structural changes in both 
lifestyle and sense of value on the part the members and 
consumers living in our high-powered consumer society. 
Materialistic consumption in the subsistence areas of "clothing, 
food, and shelter," which was the 20th century lifestyle focus, 
has reached saturation and, therefore, a limit. Industry of the 
20th century, which is based on this, is therefore directly 
confronted by growth limits and will be forced into retooling 
and long-term structural adjustments into the next century. 
Industry is in an "end-of-century structural slump," marking a 
period of fundamental shift from the old to the new. 
  By contrast, 21st century lifestyles and industry are now 
budding. With the sure spread of a lifestyle that takes 
non-materialistic living seriously, where are the possibilities 
for new businesses to be found? Permit me to try and predict 
these new business trends into the 21st century, resulting from 
a multifaceted gathering of information and analysis. 
<H5>  The Changing View of Clothing, Food, and Shelter </H5>
  First, in terms of the "clothing" aspect of the basic 
necessities of clothing, food, and shelter, we are led to 
consider "consumer fashions." Although up to now "designer 
fashions" done by eminent designers have occupied the fashion 
mainstream, the consumer herself will now be able to select from 
the growing flood of fashion selections to emphasize her own 
individuality, using her own fashion ability. Consumers will 
suddenly be made aware that they themselves can coordinate the 
flow of fashion products. It is not the designer controlling 
sensibility and fashion, but the consumer through her own 
lifestyle who will be able to manage her own fashion life. The 
fashion business will be transformed in the future. 
  In 1992, Onward made a hit in commercializing consumer 
fashions with a product line called, "Suite." It is a commercial 
development made on the premise that the consumer herself will 
combine individual pieces. We can now see the same trend in such 
products as Renown's "AAR" and World's "OZOC." One is not led to 
conclude that the fashion industry has reached the saturation 
limit; rather, new business possibilities are arising through 
wrestling with consumer fashion principles. 
  The second area is "food." We speak of a gluttonous society 
and we also see in children incidents of diabetes and even 
geriatric diseases. Thus, it is natural that healthy and natural 
foods should draw our attention. Chinese medicine is again being 
reviewed at the Toyo Medical School, and with health rules based 
afresh on natural principles, Chinese traditional nutrition and 
the art of meritorious chi are in the limelight. 
  In contrast to the art of meritorious chi, which introduces 
universal natural energy into the mind and body, Chinese 
traditional nutrition involves eating just as they are those 
foods which contain the life force, energy, and nutrients of 
universal nature. Although it is said that nutrition has a more 
than 5,000 year history, attempts are now underway to study it 
scientifically. 
  For example, it was announced at an academic conference that 
a component of catechin found in tannin in tea has efficacy in 
suppressing cancer. Foods containing green tea itself are under 
development and Chinese and Japanese teas have become highly 
popular. Beta carotene is another nutrient that has gained 
attention for its cancer suppressing ability. Furthermore, 
research continues on chitosan found in the shells of crabs and 
shrimp which is effective in lowering blood pressure and on the 
utility of food fibers and rice bran sugar which activate colon 
bacteria. We are led to consider trends toward converting these 
sorts of things into food. 
  Furthermore, there is said to be a booming market of nearly 
50 billion yen for natural water and it is now being added to 
tofu base, pickles, beer, diluted whiskey, and Japanese sake. 
There is potential for natural water and products using natural 
water to grow in the future. One can conceive of scientific 
development and production of ultra-pure water of perhaps the 
same quality as natural water. There is the artificially 
produced [sekomu] mineral water called "[Sekomu] Safe Water," 
which is close to "scientific water." 
  Third is the issue of housing. A housing environment will be 
sought which I call "five and sixth sense housing," which can 
fully satisfy the five human senses as well as our sixth sense. 
Urban civilization and culture have been thought to run counter 
to nature, but now people want to incorporate nature into their 
living space. Currently a hit are plants, pets, and home 
aquariums which combine environmental technology with the use of 
water. These can be seen as fresh "amenity conditioners" that 
combine natural breezes and natural light with the beauty of 
shade which are hallmarks of Japanese residential culture. 
Devices which direct sunlight to underground rooms and rooms 
with a northern exposure are on the market. The point is how to 
present an agreeable environment close to nature using current 
technology. 
  If we look back on history, the Phoenix Hall of the Uji 
Byodoin Temple and Taian Hermitage of Rikyu constitute a world 
of virtual reality of Buddhist paradise and perhaps now we can 
manifest the spiritual world of Zen nothingness. In Japanese 
residential culture, there is much know-how regarding this kind 
of interface and interaction with nature. It would seem 
necessary in modern housing to incorporate this kind of thing, 
of taking lessons from the past. 
<H5>  The Potential for a "Spiritual" Industry </H5>
  Although the concept of "from the material to the spiritual" 
has been discussed for ages, Japan's consumer society truly has 
an excess of "things," such as household appliances, furniture, 
and automobiles, which have been the focus of the basic 
necessities of clothing, food and shelter. I have been calling 
the "spiritual" aspect of this "HEALCI" (healthy), which 
embodies this concern. "H" stands for health, "E" for education, 
"A" for amusement, "L" for leisure, "C" for culture, and "I" for 
intelligence or information. We are led to believe that people 
have an interest in this area and will make it an important part 
of consumption. 
  Then, the fourth area is health, which comes first. In the 
area of health in the narrow sense will be growth in home 
medicine, family medicine, and family checkups. Health 
instruments one can use for self-examinations at home are 
already on the market, for example, instruments to check for 
diabetes by testing urine, wristwatches that check blood 
pressure, and pregnancy test kits. The trend toward 
self-management of health will be a new business area brought on 
by cooperation among the leading industrial nations. 
  Fifth is leisure. There was at one time an explosive boom in 
resort development, but speaking of resorts, the conspicuous 
ease of tennis courts and golf courses with their problem of 
spontaneous deterioration caused them to reach a limit. 
  An age of "leisure time farming" will come in the future. We 
may find resorts offering agriculture, fisheries, and animal 
husbandry businesses on a leisure time basis, allowing families 
and friends to do farming. The point is that they will be able 
to commune with nature and themselves. Autocamps were perhaps 
forerunners of this. 
  In England, travel to see cattle-raising has become an 
industry. In New Zealand, one travel product in the agricultural 
industry is a "farm stay" where one visits with a farm family 
and shears sheep. Also, in Japan, urban agricultural parks in 
Setagaya and Narima-ku are filled to capacity. As the nobility 
was familiar with the agricultural and fisheries industries, for 
today's city dwellers, leisure agriculture resorts will in the 
future also be a major interest. Even so, facilities will not be 
lacking, such as showers in order to tide the visitor over 
comfortably. 
  Sixth is the much talked about area of multimedia, which is 
developing into a major industry. Although the attention of the 
business world has been focused on games, a truly diverse 
industry involving culture, the arts, and education, and carried 
on multimedia, is a possibility. 
  For example, in the area of the arts, we are led to consider 
ultra art reproduction. Art will lack canvas and frames; that 
is, it will be stored on CD-ROM's, and people will be able to 
call it up for display at any time. One will not need to leave 
the house nor will the art become subject to speculation, 
linking this to democratization of the arts. As for education, 
it will be important to generate curricula and texts which will 
invigorate the diverse potential of multimedia. Culture will be 
produced scientifically and it is a certainty that multimedia 
culture, which will incorporate "cultural science," which in 
turn will combine the sensitivities of the artist, will become a 
colossal business in the coming century. It is said it will be a 
500 trillion yen business worldwide. 
  The next, or seventh area, stemming from the information 
superhighway, is the concept of "electronic retailing." Although 
CATV [cable television] is now used exclusively, ultimately 
shopless marketing will be carried on the B-ISDN [broadband 
integrated services digital networks] network. Movies, video, 
music, and educational programs will simply be brought up on 
home terminal displays. The same will be true for games. Today, 
already, Sega Enterprises is delivering 100 to 150 different 
games on an experimental basis on the Tokyo CATV Network. 
  The leading U.S. telecommunications company and Sumitomo 
Shoji will conduct experiments on Suginami CATV in a cooperative 
investment. When this begins, consumers will be able to order 
directly from their homes by referring to electronic media 
catalogs and detailed product information while simultaneously 
drawing on funds in their bank accounts in order to make 
payment. In the United States, the concept of an information 
superhighway, the B-ISBN, has been announced and will be in 
place by the year 2000. 
  Although I have discussed leisure some already, eighth is 
the 
possibility of "cyber amusement," which will combine the human 
senses with mechanical apparatuses. For example, when we attempt 
to measure the brain waves of children absorbed in the family 
computer, we find Zen-like alpha waves. Children also achieve 
Zen-like satori while playing games. Although there is talk that 
the Formula I race car driver Ayrton Senna saw God in the middle 
of a race, it may be that he was experiencing the same sort of 
thing. Importantly, in studying the ultra "giddiness boundaries" 
and making free use of high tech, electronics, and mechatronics, 
we will develop a leisure of the brain and senses. Body 
sensation games come close to this. 
<H5>  The Age of the "Brain Industry" </H5>
  As a ninth area, industry of the future will probably 
surpass 
the information industry and achieve importance as a "brain 
industry." People who are in the lead in the industrial world 
are not white collar but "platinum collar," that is, a "brain 
tribe" who do brain work, for whom it will be necessary to 
cultivate "brain tools," which will give rise to 
high-value-added "brain products." Called cyber devices, they 
are the product of advances in computer technology. Today 
computers continue shrinking in size such that we now have 
palm-sized "palmtops." Apple's "Newton" and Sharp's "GEOS" are 
on the market. 
  With computers becoming endlessly smaller and with 
handwriting recognition, data communications, and telephonic 
capabilities, they become an extension of our brains. Every 
individual will have a cyber device as a surrogate for his 
brain. The way these high-powered information knowledge products 
achieve this may be as "brain tools." 
  The 10th area is the era of a "brain industry," with offices 
becoming brain offices and cities where research centers are 
sited called "brain cities." Developing these brain cities may 
become a new business area. 
  Large factories and office buildings will be unnecessary in 
the cities of the future. Because shops will also be unnecessary 
with the information superhighway, one is led to believe that 
large buildings will also become unnecessary in large cities. If 
this happens, it will be natural that these become the biggest 
casualties of urban culture. 
  The 11th trend will be the appearance of the ecological 
city, 
which will incorporate nature. In the "Biosphere," which was 
built in the United States in the state of Arizona, a space 
colony-like situation was created in a capsule with seven to 
eight scientists now living in it experimentally. It is a city 
which exists as a living body by incorporating nature. 
  Prototypes of nature incorporated in the city produced and 
managed with scientific technology have been the realization in 
Funabashi City in Chiba Prefecture of an indoor ski slope called 
SSAWS, the "Shiigaya" indoor seaside pool in Miyazaki 
Prefecture, and an artificial wave pool at "Wild Blue Yokohama" 
in Yokohama. With lighting technology imitating the sun in the 
Tokyo Dome, there is also the possibility of neighborhood 
industries involving the atmosphere of cities. 
  The "brain city" and the "nature city" will be the 
mainstream 
cities in the future. 
  Finally, I offer as the 12th area "electronic brain 
religion." Although earlier I introduced alpha waves of children 
using the family computer, research into brain functions 
connecting science to human emotion is progressing with the 
development of the computer. Integrating the results, it will 
probably be possible to reproduce something akin to a 
religious-like experience with electronic technology. For 
example, a company in northern Kyushu called Sunray, using 
virtual reality, expects to open a theme park in 1995 that will 
give visitors experience with facing death. As a 
pseudo-religious theme park, it is an original idea for a 
business. 
  This type of electronic brain religion, in contrast to the 
life worth living, can create an "industry of death worth 
dying." It will be an industry to fulfill the desire to live 
life fully up to the moment of death, as with hospices today and 
decisions on the scattering of ashes. In the United States, the 
Tibetan Book of the Dead is being used in 
psychological treatment to prepare AIDS patients to meet death. 
<H5>  Human "Mental Abilities," the Ultimate Resource </H5>
  The above introduces 12 future business possibilities, 
although new marketing approaches will be extremely important 
for 21s-century style new businesses. Companies first will find 
it necessary to build systems that foster integrated intellect, 
knowledge, and information, that is, a "corporate brain." 
Furthermore, with major change today saturating 20th century 
industry, the ability to anticipate and foresee the future will 
be indispensable. 
  Moreover, we could say, without judging culture emotionally 
or intuitively, that an era has arrived which will develop 
scientifically. In order to foster the development of 
multimedia, "cultural science" must be tackled. Consumers, as 
urbanites, are human beings. If "human research" is neglected, 
one cannot achieve ultimate customer satisfaction. 
  New business marketing in a high-powered era will be the 
knowledge industry, which will be the embodiment of 
post-capitalism. Automation and product quality management will 
be necessary with advances in brain work productivity. The 
"mental ability" of people is the ultimate resource. In terms of 
insight, genius, intuition, and inspiration, humans possess 
enormous latent "mental abilities" and in activating them 
through scientific analysis, "filiation science strategies" and 
"filiation science marketing" based on filiation science, which 
is the science of human thought, will be needed.

  [Text] Details of a plan to revise the long-term program 
for development and utilization of nuclear power, which is a 
foundation for Japan's nuclear power development, have been 
decided. Taking into consideration concern both at home and 
abroad about Japan's use of plutonium, the government plans to 
delay operation at reprocessing plants that extract plutonium 
from spent nuclear fuel, and multiplication of plutonium at 
fast-breeder reactors. Moreover, by promoting consumption of 
plutonium at conventional nuclear power plants, the government 
intends to emphasize its policy of not leaving surplus 
plutonium. While the government intends to maintain its 
long-term nuclear fuel recycling policy, it will shift the 
nuclear power program for the first time to that which will give 
top priority to nuclear nonproliferation measures. 
  This will be the first revision of the long-term program for 
development and utilization of nuclear power in seven years. 
The Atomic Energy Commission's panel on the long-term program 
(chaired by Shoichiro Kobayashi, chairman of the Kansai Electric 
Power Co., Ltd.), which has been working on the revision, has 
compiled reports worked out by subcommittees on major topics and 
has finished its actual discussion. The panel is scheduled to 
work out a final report around June. 
  According to the draft of the final report, the timing for 
putting fast-breeder reactors to practical use will be changed 
from "between 2020 and 2030," as stipulated in the current 
long-term program, to "around 2030." The panel will spell out 
the intention of not sticking to multiplication of plutonium, 
stating the need for "a flexible policy on multiplication of 
plutonium from the viewpoint of the balance between demand and 
supply." 
  Moreover, the government plans to promote consumption of 
plutonium (plutonium thermal use) at conventional nuclear power 
plants in an effort to effectively decrease plutonium produced 
at the Rokkasho Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Plant (located in 
Rokkasho village, Aomori Prefecture), which will start operation 
after 2000; and plutonium to be transported from the UK and 
France after being reprocessed in those countries. To that end, 
conventional nuclear power plants for plutonium thermal use will 
be increased by "10 units around 2000 and by about 15 units in 
the first half of the 2000's." 
  Of approximately 30 tons of plutonium to be transported from 
foreign countries in the future, several tons will be used for 
research and development purposes, and the rest will be consumed 
at nuclear power plants. Of 35-45 tons of plutonium to be 
collected in Japan between 2000 and 2010, 15-20 tons will be 
used for research and development purposes, and 15-20 tons will 
be used at conventional nuclear power plants. These "supply and 
demand plans for plutonium" will be stipulated for the first 
time in the long-term program for nuclear power development and 
use. 
  Meanwhile, based on the view that the "actinide recycle" 
system--which burns plutonium mixed with long-lived radioactive 
wastes at fast breeder reactors--is useful for preventing 
nuclear proliferation, the governmental Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. and other institutes intend to 
tackle new research and development of the system. 
  The Rokkasho Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Plant, which is now 
under construction, will operate as scheduled. However, the 
government has decided to greatly delay operation of the second 
reprocessing plant--which was originally scheduled to start 
operation around 2010 according to the current long-term 
program--and it will "make a decision on the operation around 
2010."

  [Text] A 23-member delegation led by Dr. Sawit Phothiwihok, 
minister in the Thai Prime Minister's Office, arrived at 
Yangon's [Rangoon] airport on a Thai International flight at 
1600 this evening at the invitation of Energy Minister U Khin 
Maung Thein. The delegation was welcomed at the Yangon airport 
by Energy Minister U Khin Maung Thein, Deputy Energy Minister U 
Tin Tun, department heads under the Energy Ministry, and Thai 
Ambassador Wirasak Futrakun. 
  The visiting minister and delegation visited the Shwedagon 
Pagoda in the evening. Later, Energy Minister U Khin Maung 
Thein hosted a dinner at the Inya Lake Hotel in honor of the 
guests.

  [Text] The State Law and Order Restoration Council is 
investing huge sums of money to develop the country. Strenuous 
efforts are being made to secure and smoothen lines of 
communications. Roads are being built across the whole country. 
Railroads are being built on the hills, on the plains and along 
the coasts. Bridges are being built wherever needed along these 
new roads. The Bayint Naung bridge being built on the 
Yangon-Pathein Road is nearing completion. 
  At the Co-ordination Meeting 1/94 of the Speical Projects 
Implementation Board, Construction Minister U Khin Manung Yin 
explained arrangements made to build a bridge across Toe River 
near Maubin, a bridge across Myaungmya river near Myaungmya and 
a bridge across Thanlwin River near Pa-an which are some of the 
bridges to be built in different States and Divisions for 
regional development. Acting Railways Minister, Brig-General 
Maung Maung, explained arrangements to be made for construction 
of bridges across the River Chindwin and the River Myitthar on 
the Pakokku-Gangaw-Kalay railroad now under construction. 
  Of these six bridges, the bridge across the River Thanlwin 
near Pa-an is most interesting next to the bridge across the 
River Ayeyarwaddy near Pyay. On completion of this bridge 
across the River Thanlwin, direct communication between Kayin 
State, Mon State, Bago Division and Yangon Division will become 
ossible and Hlaingbwe, Kyondoe, Kawkareik and Myawaddy on Thai 
Border will become easily accessable. Kayin State is on the 
east of the Union of Myanmar and shares a land border with 
Thailand. The 11,730-square mile Kayin State is surrounded by 
Mandalay Division, Shan Sate, Kayah State, Mon State and Bago 
Division. In the 410 village tracts and town quarters of the 
seven townships of Kayin State dwell Skaw Kayins, Po Kayins, Bwe 
Kayins, Paku Kayins, Shans, Pa-ohs, Bamars and Mons. Kayin 
State produces paddy, groundnut, tobacco, betel nut, sugar-cane, 
rubber, iron, lead, copper, tin, wolfram and antimony. Half of 
the State is covered with evergreen forests that produce 
precious teak and Pyinkadoe woods. There are 13 industrial 
plants in the State of which the Myaing Galay Cement Mill is 
well-known. 
  Despite its wealth in food grains, fruits and flowers, Kayin 
State has a rugged topography with rivers and chaungs forming 
natural obstacles and separated from the rest of the Union of 
Myanmar by the Thanlwin River. Communications within the State 
are difficult and slow resulting in lack of development and 
progess. There is a direct air transport service to Pa-an, the 
capital of Kayin State though there is no direct land route: 
the River Thanlwin has to be crossed in a Z Craft at Myaing 
Galay in Thaton District. There is a river transport service 
from Mawlamyaing direct to Pa-an up the Thanlwin River. 
Transport of cement made at the Myaing Galay Mill is being 
distributed across the whole country only because there is a 
bridge across Thami Chaung at Dooyinseik on the border between 
Kayin State and Mon State. 
  Insurgency broke out in Kayin State simultaneously with the 
achievement of national Independence, and there has been 
virtually no peace or rule of law. Inter-communication with 
other parts of the country was difficult, intercourse was 
negligible, trade was sluggish, and development was 
non-existent. Kayin State is adjacent to Thailand yet 
cross-border trading was undeveloped for lack of peace and 
security in the State. 
  Just as the State Law and Order Restoration Council is 
striving to secure and smoothen lines of communications it is 
simultaneously also striving day and night to develop border 
regions where national races dwell. Frontiers have now been 
developed and frontier towns are today viewing TV programmes the 
same as in Yangon. The State Law and Order Restoration Council 
is strenuously striving to develop Kayin State just as trying to 
do the same with other border States of National races. Hand in 
hand with all national races the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council is endeavouring to build up a peaceful and modern Sate 
out of the Union of Myanmar. However, peace and security is 
necessary for the State Law and Order Restoration Council to be 
able to join hands with the national races and build up the 
country into a peaceful and modern State. 
  A bridge is now to be built across the Thanlwin River for 
development of Kayin State and of the frontier region. It is to 
be a steel girder bridge on reinforced concretge pylons, 900 
meters long and 8.5 meters wide with 1.5 meter foot-paths on the 
two sides. The water way under the bridge will be 110 meter 
(350 feet) wide with a head clearance of 12 meters (38 feet). 
The bridge wiith a load carrying capacity of 60 tons will cost 
about 650 million kyats (10 million US dollars.) 
  This bridge across the River Thanlwin near Pa-an will, on 
completion, will contribute a lot to national reunification, 
uniforn development of the mainland and the frontier regions, 
secure and smooth transportation and communication, and social 
and economic development of regional peoples. Kayin State will 
also become a strategic trading post in Thai-Myanmar cross 
border trading. Its trade will achieve an immediate boom. 
Myawaddy border town in Kayin State is comparatively the 
shortest route between Myanmar and Thailand. Myawaddy is a mere 
266 miles away from Yangon and about as far away from Pyinmana 
Yezin is from Yangon. A shorter route will certainly promote 
more active trading. 
  On completion of the bridge, Pa-an the capital town of Kayin 
State will be only 177 miles away from Yangon on a direct motor 
road. The pious from Yangon and all parts of the country will 
be able to make a one-day pilgrimage to the Reverend Thamanya 
Sayadaw.

  [Text] Justice Minister Nagano held a news conference this 
afternoon to clarify his remarks that the Nanjing atrocity is a 
fabrication. During the news conference, he said his remarks 
were inappropriate and retracted his controversial remarks. 
  [Begin Nagano recording] My recent remarks regarding Japan's 
past history were inappropriate and I would like to retract them. 
  With regard to the Nanjing atrocity [kakyusatsu], as I just 
said a while ago, I do not deny its occurrence. I think that the 
Nanjing atrocity was a very unfortunate incident. I also 
believe that the Nanjing atrocity was an incident for which 
Japan must apologize to the Chinese people. [end recording] 
  As for the question of his resignation, Justice Minister 
Nagano told the news conference: I talked by telephone with 
Prime Minister Hata last night. I and Prime Minister Hata share 
the same perception of the war. I will follow instructions from 
Prime Minister Hata who appointed me to the post of justice 
minister. In this way, he indicated that he will follow 
instructions from Prime Minister Hata who is due to return to 
Japan tomorrow. 
  During an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice Minister 
Nagano said that the Nanjing atrocity is a fabrication. In 
reaction to Nagano's reported remarks, Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin has expressed his displeasure with Nagano's statement and 
the Chinese Foreign Ministry has formally asked the Japanese 
Government to clarify his statement. In this way, the justice 
minister's remarks have triggered an international controversy. 
Prime Minister Hata issued a statement in Paris that the justice 
minister's remarks are inappropriate.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
personally reprimanded Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano in a 
telephone call for calling the 1937 Nanjing massacre a 
fabrication, a high-ranking government source said Friday [6 
May]. 
  The source said Hata, currently on a four-nation European 
tour, was flabbergasted by Nagano's remarks on the Nanjing 
massacre in an interview which appeared in the MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN's Wednesday editions. The source said the premier was 
"very concerned" about the fallout from Nagano's statement and 
expressed understanding of China's prompt reaction to it. The 
source said Nagano, 71, will hold a news conference Friday 
afternoon to explain his remark and apologize.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano hinted at his resignation Friday [6 May] over his earlier 
remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, saying 
the remarks were "inappropriate." Nagano told a news conference 
that he wants to completely recant his denial of the 1937 
Nanjing massacre which he had made in Wednesday's edition of the 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN, saying the slaughter was an "undeniable fact." 
  "My remarks regarding the historical incident (of the 
Nanjing 
massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I 
would like to withdraw them," Nagano said. 
  Nagano said, "I share exactly the same view with Prime 
Minister (Tsutomu) Hata, who said in Paris that our country's 
invasion and colonial rule (of Asian neighbors) inflicted 
unbearable suffering and sorrow on many people." 
  "I feel responsibility deeply, so I would like to live up to 
the decision of Hata who appointed me to this office," he said. 
  Hata, currently on a four-nation European tour, reprimanded 
Nagano over the phone on Friday for his remarks, government 
sources said. 
  Nagano told the mass-circulation MAINICHI that "the Nanjing 
incident was a fabrication," and that "I still think it wrong to 
define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)." 
  The sources said Hata was "very concerned" about the Asian 
reaction to this latest attempt to reinterpret Japan's prewar 
history. "The aggressive behavior of our nation and colonial 
domination caused unbearable suffering and sorrow on many 
people," Hata reportedly told Nagano while outlining his 
cabinet's position. 
  Supporting former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks 
that Japan made the invasion toward Asian nations, Nagano said 
during Friday's news conference, "Japan with its self-righteous 
attitude invaded (those nations) and gave unbearable pain to 
(their) people." Nagano said, "each Japanese citizen must 
recognize these historical incidents and share the resolve not 
to repeat these things." 
  Nagano, 71, a graduate of the former elite Japanese Military 
Academy, assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese 
Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended. 
  Nagano, a House of Councillors member of the coalition's 
core 
party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is a former chief of 
staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force. 
  Nagano, saying he had visited Nanjing several times before 
the end of the World War II, however, said that the number of 
people who were killed in Nanjing is not certain. "But, there 
must have been a massacre even if the number of those killed 
differs according to historians." 
  On the so-called foreign "comfort women" who were forced to 
provide sex to Japanese soldiers during World War II, Nagano 
said the government "should deal with the issue sincerely." 
  Beijing and Seoul led Asian nations in condemning Nagano's 
remarks, with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu calling 
the remarks a distortion of historical facts. 
  Domestically, the chorus of reprimands continued to build.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Japan's No. 2 opposition 
party urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [6 May] to 
sack Shigeto Nagano as justice minister over his remark that the 
1937 Nanjing massacre is "a fabrication." The Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) will demand Nagano's dismissal unless Hata sacks 
him, said Koken Nosaka, the SDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman. 
  In an interview with mass-circulation daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
published Wednesday, Nagano denied that the Nanjing massacre 
happened and said it is wrong to call Japan's World War II 
campaign a war of aggression. Following the invasion of Nanjing 
in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. 
  Japanese historians, however, tend to cite much lower 
estimates and some also contend that the mass killings were not 
ordered but caused by troops that got out of hand. The 
international war tribunal estimated the number at more than 
200,000. 
  On Wednesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "a 
Japanese cabinet member went so far as to publicly distort 
history, deny the historical facts and defend the Japanese 
militarists' aggression. We are shocked and indignant about 
this." 
  South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese 
Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto on Friday that Nagano's 
remarks are a distortion of historical facts. 
  Nagano, a member of the House of Councillors and a former 
chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, was given the 
justice portfolio in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on April 28. 
  The SDP, whose members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime 
ministerial elections April 25, quit the ruling coalition last 
week in protest against the establishment of a large 
parliamentary grouping by coalition partners, excluding the SDP. 
  The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic 
Party and the SDP, are now both in the opposition camp. 
  The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) also demanded Nagano's 
dismissal, saying it cannot pardon his remark that completely 
denies Japan's historic crime. 
  Kazuo Shii, chief of the JCP Secretariat, said Nagano's 
remark "is an astonishingly wild one to defend the worst war 
crimes by the Japanese militarism...The Nanjing massacre has 
been proved by a number of concrete facts." Shii said if Hata 
obscures the matter, it will lead to no confidence of the 
cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The leading opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party, whose elders have repeatedly caused 
international stirs with comments sanitizing Japan's war crimes, 
criticized Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano on Friday [6 May] for 
making a "careless" remark on the 1937 Nanjing massacre. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said in a prepared 
statement, "the justice minister's comments were careless and 
the LDP cannot help saying he should have exerted greater 
caution as an incumbent cabinet minister." 
  Mori, the LDP's No. 2 man, "it must be Japan's basic 
political attitude in the eyes of domestic and international 
people to seek to build peace in order to prevent an unhappy war 
from being repeated." [paragraph as received] 
  His comments followed an international uproar triggered by 
Nagano's remark that the 1937 massacre at the then Chinese 
capital of Nanjing was a "fabrication." 
  Mori's comments contrasted sharply with those by some top 
LDP 
policymakers and elders after former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa described Japan's invasion of Asian neighbors in the 
1930s and 1940s as a "war of aggression." 
  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, at that time criticized Hosokawa's remarks as 
insensitive to the bereaved families of Japanese soldiers who 
perished in battlefields before and during World War II. "We 
don't want (the prime minister) to say something that might 
trigger repercussions," Hashimoto said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The leader of the No. 2 party 
in the ruling coalition urged Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano on 
Friday [6 May] to step down to take the blame for an 
international outcry triggered by his remark concerning Japan's 
wartime brutalities. 
  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said, "although it 
was proper for him to have withdrawn his remark, it does not 
release him from the need to take the responsibility as a 
cabinet minister." Ichikawa is regarded as the archally of the 
prime coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa. 
  Nagano, the 71-year-old army general-turned politician, is 
from Ozawa's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Shinseito and 
Komeito have closely cooperated in pushing the policies of the 
coalition government. 
  Ichikawa went on to say the remark was "inappropriate as 
that 
of a cabinet minister." Ichikawa made the remarks a few hours 
after Nagano apologized for making the remark that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's No. 2 
opposition party urged Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano to resign 
over his remark that the 1937 Nanjing massacre is "a 
fabrication." 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan, SDPJ] (SDP), said the matter has not ended even if 
Nagano retracted his earlier remark. "Mr. Nagano should take 
responsibility and make clear his course of action," he said. 
  Earlier in the day, Koken Nosaka, the SDP's Diet Affairs 
Committee chairman, urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to sack 
Nagano as justice minister. 
  The SDP will demand Nagano's dismissal unless Hata sacks

proved by a number of concrete facts." Shii said if Hata 
obscures the matter, it will lead to no confidence of the 
cabinet. 
  On Wednesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "a 
Japanese cabinet member went so far as to publicly distort 
history, deny the historical facts and defend the Japanese 
militarists' aggression. We are shocked and indignant about 
this." 
  South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese 
Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto on Friday that Nagano's 
remarks are a distortion of historical facts. 
  Nagano, a member of the House of Councillors and a former 
chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, was given the 
justice portfolio in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on April 28. 
  The SDP, whose members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime 
ministerial elections April 25, quit the ruling coalition last 
week in protest against the establishment of a large 
parliamentary grouping by coalition partners, excluding the SDP. 
  The country's two largest parties, the Liberal Democratic 
Party and the SDP, are now both in the opposition camp.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Tsutomu Hata will make his 
parliamentary debut as prime minister next week with a 
relatively high public rating but surrounded by increasingly 
hostile opposition forces determined to topple his minority 
government. 
  The Hata coalition itself already appears to be in disarray 
with rifts emerging within two of its partners -- the Japan New 
Party (JNP) headed by Hata's predecessor in the premiership 
Morihiro Hosokawa and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). 
  Another headache for the Hata cabinet, inaugurated in late 
April, is a controversial remark on Japan's wartime actions by 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano which angered its Asian 
neighbors still harboring memories of Japanese aggression before 
and during World War II. 
  Political sources said Nagano, a former chief of staff of 
the 
Ground Self-Defense Force, will likely be forced to resign only 
a few days after he was installed in the post. 
  Nagano, who participated in the invasion of China as an 
Imperial Army soldier, told the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper this 
week that the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in which China says more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians were killed, is a "fabrication." 
He also challenged Hosokawa's statement that Japan waged "a war 
of aggression and a wrong war," saying Japan fought the war to 
liberate Asian countries from their Western colonizers. 
  His remark immediately sparked sharp and bitter reactions 
from China, South and North Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and other 
Asian countries. 
  Hata, now touring Europe, also criticized Nagano, saying the 
remarks were "inappropriate" and Japan's wartime aggression 
inflicted "unbearable pain and sorrow on many people." 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the country's No 2 
opposition party, has calLed on Hata to sack Nagano. The 
Japanese Communist Party and Komeito, a coalition partner, have 
also demanded his dismissal. 
  The prime minister will deliver a policy speech to both 
houses of the Diet next Tuesday, and will answer questions from 
both ruling and opposition legislators Thursday and Friday as 
well as May 16. 
  The prime minister is taking the helm at a time when Japan 
faces such major issues as a trade row with the United States, 
tax reform and the suspected North Korean development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  But the most immediate task for his cabinet is the 
parliamentary passage of the overdue national budget for fiscal 
1994 which began April 1. Speculation is mounting that the 
cabinet will be forced to resign en masse or dissolve the House 
of Representatives for a snap general election after the budget, 
badly needed to rev up an economy in the doldrums, has been 
cleared through the Diet. 
  The major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ousted 
from power by Hosokawa last August after steering the nation for 
38 years straight, is poised to join hands in Diet business with 
the SDP, which bolted the Hata coalition to become the No. 2 
opposition force. 
  With the withdrawal of the SDP, the largest power group in 
the former coalition in terms of number of Diet members, the 
Hata camp's strength in the lower chamber has been reduced to 
182, far short of the 256 majority in the 511-member house. 
  Since both the LDP and the SDP have pledged to cooperate 
with 
Hata in passing the national budget, no major political upset is 
predicted before its clearance, but Diet business thereafter 
will be tough going for the Hata administration, political 
commentators concurred. 
  Political sources said Hosokawa's JNP, from which three 
lawmakers have already deserted, will see a further desertion 
this week -- possibly more than 10 of its 37 members -- as 
dissatisfaction mounts over its leadership's inclination toward 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, the core power 
blocs in the coalition. 
  Similar disgruntlement is also swirling among members of the 
DSP, whose head Keigo Ouchi masterminded a plan to form a 
parliamentary group -- the plan which eventually drove the SDP, 
antagonistic to some of the political initiatives of Shinseito 
and Komeito, out of the coalition, the sources said. 
  Despite the political waves, the Hata cabinet maintains a 
high public popularity, although the rating is considerably 
lower than that of the Hosokawa government when it was 
inaugurated. 
  A KYODO NEWS SERVICE poll conducted this week gave the Hata 
cabinet a 51.6 percent public approval rating, 24.1 percentage 
points less than the Hosokawa administration at its inception. 
  Important economic figures to be released next week include 
the international balance of payments for April and fiscal 1993 
(Monday). 
  The Economic Planning Agency will release a monthly economic 
report Tuesday. [passage omitted]

program] 
  [Text] Justice Minister Nagano has said that the Nanjing 
atrocity is a fabrication and South Korea and China are reacting 
against his remarks. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu called in 
Japanese 
Ambassador to Seoul Toshio Goto today to protest against 
Nagano's remarks. During his meeting with the Japanese 
ambassador, Foreign Minister Han said: We regret Justice 
Minister Nagano's remarks which have thrown cold water on new 
efforts by the South Korean and Japanese Governments to build a 
new relationship. I hope the Japanese Government will take 
proper steps to deal with his remarks. 
  About 50 South Korean bereaved family members of victims of 
the Pacific war assembled today in front of the Japanese Embassy 
in Seoul to throw eggs into the embassy building and demand the 
sacking of Justice Minister Nagano. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is believed to be 
assessing 
to some extent Justice Minister Nagano's retraction of his 
remarks that the Nanjing atrocity is a fabrication. So far, 
however, some Japanese cabinet ministers have denied Japan's war 
of aggression against China and the atrocity perpetrated by 
Japanese soldiers in China. Therefore, the Chinese Government is 
expected to carefully watch how the Japanese Government will 
deal with Nagano's remarks. 
  South Korean and Chinese Governments are asking the Japanese 
Government to take proper steps to deal with the controversial 
remarks through Japanese embassies in Seoul and Beijing. In 
response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terada has said that the 
Japanese Government intends to respond to the South Korean and 
Chinese Governments through diplomatic channels about how the 
Japanese Government plans to deal with the controversial remarks 
after Prime Minister Hata returns home tomorrow.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The Food Agency will halve 
the amount of Thai rice it allots to rice wholesalers in May due 
to poor sales, agency officials said Friday [6 May]. Stocks of 
the Thai grain are beginning to pile up at both the wholesale 
and retail stages in reflection of its unpopularity among 
consumers, the officials said. 
  The step is temporary and the agency will decide on further 
measures after seeing how sales go, they said. 
  Rice wholesalers said, however, it will be difficult to 
adjust the oversupply in Thai rice unless the government 
continues to cut down on its compulsory allocation. 
  The agency has so far sold domestic rice, imported medium- 
to 
short-grained rice, and long-grained Thai rice at a 3-to-5-to-2 
ratio. 
  Thai rice has proved difficult to sell, with many consumers 
leaving packages at stores after unwillingly buying them in a 
set with other types of the grain, according to industry 
officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- About 90 percent of food 
service firms surveyed serve foreign rice to customers, 
according to a private survey published Friday [6 May]. 
  The survey, compiled by the Japan Food Service Association, 
showed that 167, or 91.3 percent, of the 183 firms polled said 
they use foreign rice. 
  Of the 167 companies, about 50 percent said foreign rice 
accounts for more than half of the rice they serve. 
  Around 80 percent of them also said they do something to 
improve the taste, like adding additives. 
  The poll, conducted in mid-April, also found that U.S.-grown 
rice is the most frequently used, followed by grains from 
Thailand, China, and Australia. 
  Asked about how foreign rice is received by customers, 41.4 
percent reported little reactions, while 37.2 percent noted 
mostly favorable reactions. Another 5.5 percent replied foreign 
rice is only poorly received.

    [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2236 GMT on 30 April, in its "News 2001" program, 
carries a live 25-minute interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary 
general of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), by FNN 
announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Tomomi Seki, political commentator 
Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki 
Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo. 
  At the outset of the interview, Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment 
on the Hata coalition government. Mori stresses: "If the 
LDP--the largest political party--had formed a coalition 
government, the current political upheaval would have not 
occurred." Calling the Hosokawa coalition government a 
"failure," Mori notes that the ruling coalition partners had 
difficulty in coordinating policy amongst themselves, then 
stresses: "The coalition partners should have turned over power 
to the LDP in accordance with the principle of constitutional 
government." 
  Discussing the fate of the Hata government, Mori notes the 
206 seats held by the LDP in the House of Representatives, 
stating: "The Hata cabinet is saddled with too many problems in 
various aspects." During the interview, Mori criticizes Prime 
Minister Hata for not apologizing to the people for supporting 
former Prime Minister Hosokawa while he served as deputy prime 
minister in the Hosokawa cabinet. Mori emphatically states: 
"In any case, we have to get a budget bill for fiscal 1994 
passed in the Diet. He adds: "Various changes are expected to 
take place once the budget bill is enacted." Discussing the 
prospects of the LDP retaking power, Mori states: "The LDP is 
presently engaged in soul-searching on its losing power, using 
the time to make various efforts and study various things." He 
adds: "From now on, the LDP will have to consider the process 
of retaking power and work on polishing its public image." 
  Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the LDP seeking an 
alliance with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in a 
bid to return to power, Mori states: "It would be very 
difficult to reach an agreement with the SDPJ on policies." 
  Noting that an FNN poll shows 64.3 percent of the voters 
believe the House of Representatives must be dissolved prior to 
general elections once the budget bill is enacted in the Diet, 
Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment. Mori discusses how the LDP worked 
on political reform, particularly the reform of the current 
electoral system in the past, stating: "The next general 
elections must be held under a new electoral system called the 
combined electoral system of proportional representation and 
single-seat constituency." Hinting at the possibility of the 
LDP submitting a no-confidence motion to the Diet against the 
Hata cabinet for delaying the enactment of the budget bill, Mori 
stresses: "All Diet members are responsible for speedy 
deliberation of the budget bill and its quick enactment." 
  Discussing how the LDP intends to retake power, Mori points 
out: "Hata has virtually no knowledge of how to stimulate the 
economy." He discovered this when Hata served as finance 
minister in the LDP government. Noting that "industrialists and 
business managers have come to find that only the LDP's policies 
can make it possible to run Japan's economy smoothly," Mori 
says: "The LDP is presently working hard to polish its public 
image." 
  Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the LDP splitting 
again, Mori states: "The LDP is formed by politicians with 
differing views." 
  Kuroiwa concludes the interview at 2351 GMT after thanking 
the participants.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Business sentiment among 
small and medium-sized firms is improving, a survey by the Japan 
Finance Corporation for Small Business showed Friday [6 May]. 
  According to the survey taken in the January-March period, 
the diffusion index (di) for the economy stood at minus 28.2, 
improving 9.0 percentage points from the previous three months 
and contracting for the second quarter in a row. The figure 
represents the number of companies saying the economy is 
worsening subtracted from those saying it is picking up. 
  A corporation official said the minus figure is still large, 
adding, "we need to wait and watch a little more before saying 
the trend has changed" from the recessionary stage. 
  The di for sales and profit improved for the second term in 
a 
row, but the di for the number of employees remained weak. 
  The survey was conducted on 13,000 small and medium-sized 
companies at the end of March, with 45.7 percent responding.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Imports of home-use 
videocassette recorders (VCRs) and color television sets 
continued to increase in March while domestic production of the 
appliances remained depressed, an industry report showed Friday 
[6 May]. 
  The report issued by the Electronic Industries Association 
of 
Japan said March imports of VCRs rose 10.0 percent from a year 
earlier to 60,000 units, while those of color TVs soared 106.9 
percent to 485,000. 
  South Korea was the biggest supplier of VCRs in the month, 
accounting for 30,000 of the total, while more than 30 percent 
of foreign-made color TVs came from Malaysia. Malaysia came 
second after South Korea in VCR exports to Japan and South Korea 
followed Malaysia in TV shipments. 
  Other major suppliers of VCRs and TVs are Thailand, 
Indonesia, Taiwan, and Singapore. 
  Domestically produced VCRs numbered 1,389,000 in March, down 
9.0 percent, while domestic output of color TVs decreased 8.4 
percent to 907,000. 
  VCR shipments totaled 1,528,000 units, down a sharp 24.5 
percent, with those for the domestic market accounting for 
425,000 units, up 6.0 percent. 
  VCR exports in the month declined 15.2 percent to 1,424,000 
units, as shipments to the United States, the European Union 
(EU), and some Asian countries were sluggish. 
  Shipments of color TVs amounted to 1,236,000 units, up 8.3 
percent, of which 833,000, or 2.1 percent more than the 
year-earlier levels, were for Japanese consumers. Exports of 
color televisions totaled 362,000 units, a 25.4 percent jump, 
with those to China, Hong Kong, the U.S., and the United Arab 
Emirates posting increases.

  [Text] According to a military source, on 3 May, the U.S. 
imperialists deployed from overseas bases for mobile operations 
several tens of fighter planes and lethal equipment in South 
Korea. Following this, they waged a provocative joint aerial war 
exercise aimed at a northward invasion. 
  That day, F-15 fighter-bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault 
planes, 
AV-8 vertical take-off and landing assault planes, KC-135 
refueling planes, which were flown in from U.S. Pacific bases, 
were deployed for mobile operations at the bases of the U.S. 
occupation air force in South Korea. 
  That day, too, C-141 and C-130 transport squadrons carrying 
numerous troops of aggression and lethal equipment flew into 
South Korea one after another from overseas bases. 
  In accordance with the integrated operational plans of the 
U.S. Pacific Area Air Force Command and Naval Command, a joint 
aerial war exercise of a northward invasion was frantically 
waged, centered on the areas over Tokchok Island, Yoju, 
Chongson, and Muju that day. 
  Put into this frantic war exercise were airplane squadrons, 
which had come for mobile operations from overseas bases, and 
about 450 fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, 
reconnaissance planes, and armed helicopters belonging to the 
U.S. occupation air force in South Korea and to the puppet air 
force. 
  Within the system of this war exercise, KC-135 refueling 
planes conducted midair refueling for about 50 F-16 and F-15 
fighter-bombers which were flying around for a joint aerial war 
exercise of a northward invasion, using an area over the sea off 
Kunsan as an operational arena. 
  This war exercise, sputtering the fire of a war [chonjaengui 
pulshiga tuingguinun], was a reckless playing with fire aimed at 
promoting the practical cooperation between the overseas-based 
air squadrons, and the U.S. occupation air force in South Korea 
and the puppet air force and at increasing the capabilities for 
an actual warfare with a succession of surprise strikes against 
strategic sites in the northern part of the Republic with the 
support of midair refueling planes. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran wild in a war 
exercise of a northward invasion in an area near the Military 
Demarcation Line, right in front of our nose. 
  On 3 May, the puppet Army's tank group deployed in Kumpa-ri 
in Paju County fired about 20 shells at Hapo-ri. The puppet 
Army's large-caliber gun units, which had held firing positions 
in Mago-ri of Yonchon County, Yongsan-ri of Paju County, and 
Yulli-ri of Chorwon County of South Korea's Kangwon Province, 
fired some 70 shells into the areas adjacent to the DMZ, thereby 
showing off a war frenzy. 
  On the same day, some 10 (?500)-MD armed helicopters, which 
had been mobilized in the air over Paju, Yonchon, and Chorwon of 
South Korea's Kangwon Province, instigated a war atmosphere by 
frantically waging an exercise of missile strikes and support 
for ground attacks. 
  The reckless war maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the 
South Korean puppets, which are becoming graver day after day, 
prove that the rascals are running along the path to 
confrontation and war, running counter the peace and easing of 
tension in Korea.

  [Text] According to a military source, on 4 May, the U.S. 
imperialists waged an aerial surprise strike exercise with the 
South Korean puppets, by introducing fighter-bombers, 
pursuit-assault planes, early warning planes, and electronic 
jamming planes from overseas bases into South Korea. 
  Prior to this provocative war exercise, EA-6 electronic 
jamming planes, which had been flown in from a Japanese base, 
created an electronic jam by flying into the areas over Yongwol 
and Pyongchang--the operational areas. 
  Timed with this, E-3 early warning planes mobilized from 
overseas bases ran amok in waging an exercise of launching a 
surprise bombing by calling air squadrons [pihaengdaedul] out, 
while flying in the air where an electronic jam had been created. 
  Converged into this extremely dangerous war were air 
squadrons which had come from U.S. Pacific bases and 
fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and 
(?reconnaissance) planes belonging to the U.S. occupation air 
force in South Korea and to the puppet air force. 
  In the meantime, the puppet Army's 105-mm artillery group, 
which held firing positions in Mago-ri, Yonchon County; and 
Naedae-ri, Chorwon County and (Tajon-ni), Inje County, Kangwon 
Province of South Korea, displayed that day a war frenzy by 
firing several tens of rounds at the areas near the DMZ of the 
Military Demarcation Line.

<F P=106> ["World Is Watching U.S. Attitude" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Government in a 
Foreign Ministry statement April 28 proposed to the United 
States that the two countries hold negotiations for the 
establishment of a new peace arrangement which will help to 
check arms buildup and recurrence of war, stabilize the 
situation and reliably guarantee a durable peace and security on 
the Korean peninsula on a practical basis. 
  How the United States approaches the DPRK's new peace 
overture for negotiations will be a touchstone proving whether 
it wants peace or war, declares NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It is imperative to replace the armistice agreement with a 
peace agreement and set up a new peace arrangement to take the 
place of the present armistice mechanism, if the hostile 
relations are to be removed and rapprochement is to be achieved 
between the DPRK and the USA and genuine peace and security are 
to be guaranteed on the Korean peninsula. 
  The continued acute military confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula is attributable to the illegalities and the policy of 
antagonizing and stifling the DPRK on the part of the United 
States which has wantonly violated the Korean armistice 
agreement and paralyzed the armistice mechanism. 
  If the present state of truce is to be maintained on the 
Korean peninsula, the signatories to the armistice agreement 
must fulfill their obligations pursuant to the agreement. Over 
the period of a little more than four decades, however, the 
United States has unilaterally and systematically broken and 
violated the provisions of the armistice agreement. Their 
violations of it have assumed more grave dimensions these days. 
  As a matter of fact, the United States disowns the 
effectiveness of the agreement and even ignores its existence. 
  The illegalities of the United States have reduced the 
armistice agreement to a mere sheet of paper and deprived it of 
the role as an institutional mechanism to prevent the 
aggravation of tensions and the danger of war. 
  Due to the maneuvers of the United States, the armistice 
supervisory tool is paralyzed and the armistice mechanism is 
incapable of performing its function. 
  With a view to concealing its violations of the armistice 
agreement, the United States unilaterally forced the inspection 
teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw 
from the U.N. command-controlled area and unilaterally 
designated a South Korean Army "general" as the chief delegate 
of the U.N. Command to the Military Armistice Commission, for 
which he is totally unqualified because of legal irrelevance, in 
gross violation of the Korean armistice agreement. 
  The unreasonable behavior of the United States has reduced 
the Military Armistice Commission to a de facto nominal and 
inoperative body in which its legitimate component parties have 
ceased to exist. 
  We can no longer entertain any expectation of the armistice 
agreement and the armistice mechanism, which remain only in name 
and are used for covering up the U.S. policy of strangling the 
DPRK. 
  The nuclear issue and other acute problems cannot be settled 
on the Korean peninsula as long as there exists the present 
armistice arrangement under which the DPRK and the USA remain 
hostile parties. 
  Facts show that only when the armistice agreement is 
replaced 
with a peace agreement and a new peace arrangement is set up to 
take the place of the present armistice mechanism will it be 
possible to remove the hostile relations and achieve 
reconciliation between the DPRK and the USA and preserve a 
genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States must clearly see the essence of the 
situation and the reality and accede to peace negotiations with 
the DPRK.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on S. Korean Authorities' </F>
Slander on DPRK's Peace Overture -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Foreign Ministry of the DPRK answered a question of KCNA today 
concerning the abuses heaped by the South Korean authorities on 
the DPRK's proposal for peace negotiations contained in the 
Foreign Ministry statement dated April 28. 
  He said: 
  The statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry proposing 
negotiations to the U.S. side for the establishment of a new 
peace arrangement that will replace the present armistice 
arrangement in Korea has evoked great repercussions upon the 
world public. The South Korean authorities, however, are trying 
hard to decry it. 
  The "unification minister" and the "foreign minister" of 
South Korea made a fuss, claiming that the establishment of a 
peace arrangement is a matter that must be discussed between the 
North and the South of Korea, not between the DPRK and the USA 
and that the proposal is a "negotiation card" to get concessions 
at the third round of DPRK-USA talks. 
  This is an obtrusive and imprudent act of those oblivious of 
their lot. 
  The DPRK Government proposed to the United States that the 
two countries hold negotiations for the establishment of a new 
peace arrangement, taking into account the legal and practical 
conditions that the United States is a signatory to the 
Armistice Agreement and it is in actuality holding the military 
prerogative in South Korea. 
  The South Korean authorities categorically opposed the 
signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement at the time of its 
conclusion and now have no complete military prerogative in 
South Korea, so they have no authority and qualification for 
participating in peace negotiations. 
  The replacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a 
peace agreement and the establishment of a new peace arrangement 
that will replace the present armistice mechanism are urgent 
problems raised by the present situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Such complicate problems as the "nuclear issue" have cropped 
up on the Korean peninsula because the United States shipped 
nuclear and other mass-destruction weapons into South Korea in 
violation of the Armistice Agreement. And the tensions are now 
mounting because the United States is accelerating arms buildup 
and increasing military threat to the DPRK. 
  This shows that the Korean Armistice Agreement and armistice 
mechanism are incapable of preventing arms buildup and 
recurrence of war and preserving peace on the Korean peninsula. 
  To terminate the state of truce that causes only political 
distrust and military confrontation and establish a new peace 
arrangement at an early date is the only way of easily solving 
the pending issues between the DPRK and the USA including the 
"nuclear issue." There has been adopted a North-South agreement 
with nonaggression as its keynote and organised a North-South 
joint military committee pursuant to it. So the establishment 
of a new peace arrangement would facilitate their effectuation 
and, further, the problem of preserving a durable peace on the 
Korean peninsula would be resolved completely. 
  In mid-April the South Korean authorities revoked the 
exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South as a 
precondition for the DPRK-USA talks, saying that if the DPRK-USA 
talks were promoted, "replacement of the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace agreement" would be put on the agenda and then the 
North-South dialogue will go well. But now they blindly oppose 
our practical proposal for replacing the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace agreement. This makes it plain that they are 
weathercocks who have no clear principle concerning peace and 
reunification of the Korean peninsula and blow hot and cold. 
  What they are advised to do is to refrain from following a 
big power and imprudently poking their nose into other's affairs.

<F P=106> [White paper on the ROK's development of fast-breeder </F>
reactor, issued by the Central Committee of the South Korea 
National Democratic Front on 2 May] 
  [Text] According to the Voice of National Salvation from 
Seoul, the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] 
Central Committee issued the following white paper on 2 May, 
exposing the South Korean puppet clique's attempt to accelerate 
its nuclear armament by developing fast-breeder reactors: 
<H5>  The White Paper on the ROK's Development of Fast-Breeder </H5>
Reactors 
  1. The Blitz [chongyokchok] Development of 
Fast-Breeder Reactors 
  According to the June 1992 final decision of the Atomic 
Energy Commission [AEC] on its plan for atomic energy research 
and development, the ROK is supposed to complete the development 
of positive reactors [silchungno], which is the third stage of 
fast-breeder reactor development, 19 years ahead of Japan, which 
has now started to operate prototype reactors [wonhyongno]. 
  In order to realize this plan, the ROK is using the same 
blitz mosaic method of synthesizing various countries' 
technologies that is used to develop nuclear weapons. 
  The ambition of ROK rulers to develop fast-breeder reactors 
began in the eighties. According to a report on the 
proliferation of mass-killing weapons which is a secret document 
of the Russian bureau of foreign intelligence, the ROK 
authorities agreed early in 1984 with a European country that 
possessed the most advanced technology in developing 
fast-breeder reactors, to introduce its fast-breeder reactors 
and thus began to introduce core technologies, designs, and 
experimental reactor facilities [silhomno solbidul]. The 
Institute of Atomic Energy Research thus secretly developed an 
experimental reactor with a diameter of 1 meter at the end of 
the eighties, and has used it in the various technological 
experiments required in the development of prototype and 
positive reactors. 
  In the nineties, the Chongwadae ruling group began to 
develop 
the prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan. On 25 May 
1990, the government authorities and Japan signed an agreement 
on cooperation in the atomic energy field, and agreed to promote 
technological exchanges and joint research on atomic energy. In 
an ROK-Japan conference on atomic energy held on 9 November 
1990, they conspired [moui] to jointly promote the development 
of next-generation reactors. 
  In an exclusive secret meeting between Kim Yong-sam and 
Hosokawa in Kyongju on 6 November 1993, they even secretly 
signed an agreement on ROK-Japan joint promotion to develop 
nuclear weapons in return for calling off Japan's repayment for 
its past crimes. 
  When they began to suddenly [chongyokchoguro] introduce 
technology and experience for the development of prototype 
reactors from Japan, government authorities decided to invest 
about 2 trillion won in atomic energy research and development, 
such as the development of a fast-breeder reactor. They began 
to push ahead with the development of a prototype reactor in 
1992, mobilizing all experts concerned with [words indistinct]. 
  Regarding this, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN dated 29 July 1992 
reported: the ROK has already started to develop fast-breeder 
reactors, hastening its mid- and long-term plans. 
  According to the ROK experts on nuclear development, the 
design of a prototype fast-breeder reactor was turned over to 
Korea Heavy Industries by the Institute of Atomic Energy 
Research, and they have not only started to produce facilities 
of the prototype reactor but also completed a basic study on 
positive reactors, drafted a conceptional design, and set aside 
budgeting for it, with an investment of 118.3 billion won. 
  Today, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is busy seeking 
justification from the international community regarding the 
lawfulness of the fast-breeder reactor development. 
  In October 1993, the Kim Yong-sam group held an 
international 
symposium on next-generation reactors in Seoul and even had some 
quarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
promise to cooperate in the ROK plan to develop next-generation 
reactors. 
  At that time, in a public notice issued in a news conference 
in Seoul, Greenpeace exposed and denounced that, far from 
discussing scientific and technological problems, this symposium 
was a meeting to encourage construction for producing plutonium 
in the ROK, as well as an insidious meeting that would bring the 
danger of nuclear war closer to East Asia. 
  2. The Ulterior Motive Behind Development of the 
Fast-Breeder Reactor 
  Throughout the world, the fast-breeder reactor is 
acknowledged as lacking economic advantages and safety. For 
this reason, the countries developing it have either suspended 
its operation or closed it down--the United States in 1977, 
France seven years after its initiation of operations, and 
Britain in 1994. Germany gave up operating a test reactor which 
it had built. 
  (Frank Hanabby), a British nuclear physicist, who visited 
Japan recently, likened the Monju, the Japanese reactor for 
producing high-purity plutonium which was put into operation 
sometime ago, to a nuclear explosion waiting to happen. 
Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are desperately engaged in the 
development of a fast-breeder reactor. This is directly 
connected with their ambition to develop nuclear weapons. We 
are making this statement based on the following grounds: 
First, if the South Korean authorities develop the fast-breeder 
reactor, they can multiply and produce a large quantity of 
plutonium for the production of nuclear bombs. The December 
1991 issue of MAL magazine stated that since the fast-breeder 
reactor is a device justifying the massive stockpile and 
production of plutonium, which is the raw material for nuclear 
weapons, the country operating it should have little difficulty 
in producing nuclear weapons. The South Korean ruling group is 
attempting to secure a large quantity of plutonium through the 
development of the fast-breeder reactor. 
  Second, the development of the fast-breeder reactor provides 
a pretext justifying the purchase of plutonium from a foreign 
country. Because the fast-breeder reactor is a reactor which 
feeds on plutonium, if the fast-breeder reactor is developed, 
South Korea can massively and legitimately import plutonium and 
the dioxide of highly enriched uranium, which the authorities 
have secretly been importing from Britain. (Kim Chi-o), atomic 
energy policy officer of the Ministry of Science and Technology, 
has stated that plutonium, the raw nuclear material that is to 
be used in the fast-breeder reactor, will be imported from a 
foreign country. 
  Third, the fast-breeder reactor must be equipped with 
reprocessing facilities. WOLGAN CHOSON, April 1990 issue, noted 
that the introduction of the fast-breeder reactor is a 
prerequisite to the construction of a reprocessing plant, adding 
that since the introduction of the fast-breeder reactor is 
almost certain, the construction of a reprocessing plant is a 
question of time. 
  Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the National Assembly Foreign 
and 
Unification Affairs Committee, openly calling for a review of 
the North-South agreements of 1991, asserting, "We cannot 
continue depending on another country for nuclear fuel." This 
clearly illustrates how frenziedly the Kim Yong-sam ring is 
attempting to provide reprocessing facilities with the 
development of the fast-breeder reactor. 
  Fourth, the development of the fast-breeder reactor is in 
itself a process to develop a nuclear bomb. Technologically, 
the theory of designing the fast-breeder reactor and that of 
designing the nuclear bomb are the same. Therefore, the 
technology for the development of the fast-breeder reactor means 
in many respects the transfer of the technology for the 
development of a nuclear bomb. Furthermore, nuclear physicists 
say that the high-purity plutonium obtained from the 
fast-breeder reactor can be used for the production of a nuclear 
bomb with the appropriate critical mass [imgye chillyang]. 
  The stern reality clearly proves that the traitorous ruling 
group in the South scrapped the joint declaration on 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula agreed upon between the 
North and the South and that it is persistently engaged in the 
development of nuclear weapons. Their attempt to extract 
plutonium by developing the fast-breeder reactor, the monster 
called a time-bomb, which is prone to horrible accidents, and to 
make criminal nuclear weapons that will destroy the entire 
nation, is an unpardonable antinational crime. 
  The persons in authority should not only abolish the 
heavy-water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor but 
suspend the development of the fast-breeder reactor immediately. 
The international reactionary forces, including Japan, should 
stop acts of conspiring with the Kim Yong-sam ring in its 
development of the fast-breeder reactor directly connected with 
the development of nuclear bombs. 
  Our SKNDF and patriotic masses will certainly check and 
frustrate the Kim Yong-sam ring's development of the 
fast-breeder reactor for nuclear armament and its maneuvers to 
secure a large quantity of plutonium. We express the hope that 
the world's fair opinion will wage vigorous activities to trace 
to the end and stop the South Korean rulers' maneuvers to 
develop the fast-breeder reactor and nuclear weapons.

us is reaching extremes. According to a broadcast report from 
Seoul on 4 May, Kim Yong-sam the traitor threw another party at 
Nokchiwon garden in Chongwadae and talked nonsense about us. 
  Sitting with fellows from the Advisory Council for 
Democratic 
and Peaceful Unification, he said that our nuclear development 
is targeted at South Korea and that the North is even violating 
the armistice agreement. This is like a thief turning on the 
master with a club. 
  He said that after announcing the withdrawal from the 
Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty last year, we have accelerated nuclear 
development during the past year while insisting on the frame of 
confrontation. He even repeated that nuclear development of the 
North should be blocked in any event. Traitor Kim Yong-sam said 
some useless things to threaten someone by mentioning words, 
such as "destruction." 
  Such a reverse propaganda of the national traitor, war 
maniac, and fascist devilish homicide Kim Yong-sam is rude 
remarks that can only be made by South Korean puppets who are 
experienced in reversing black and white, and a cunning trick to 
divert South Korean people's attention elsewhere from their 
internal crisis. 
  First of all, regarding our so-called nuclear development 
raved by traitor Kim Yong-sam, those remarks resulted from the 
fear that their nuclear development maneuvers might be 
discovered by the world. In fact, the ones who are developing 
nuclear weapons are not us but the South Korean puppets 
themselves. 
  South Korea's heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok Complex are military 
nuclear reactors built under the objective to develop nuclear 
weapons. It is not a secret that plutonium and highly enriched 
uranium are produced here. The whole world knows that the 
heavy-water reactor in Wolsong alone has produced enough spent 
fuel containing plutonium to produce more than 370 nuclear bombs. 
  As exposed by the Central Committee of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front, the South Korean puppets are 
accelerating the development of positive reactors [silchungno], 
which is the third phase of the development of a fast breeder 
reactor. 
  Even while frantically accelerating nuclear development, 
they said we were developing nuclear weapons to use against 
them. This is none other than a scheme to accelerate their 
efforts to develop and arm themselves with nuclear weapons by 
using us as a pretext. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam also said that we were violating the 
armistice agreement. This is also ridiculous. 
  The Korean armistice agreement bans the introduction of 
operational materials into Korea. Nevertheless, the United 
States, a party to the armistice agreement, has continuously 
brought numerous operational materials and military personnel 
into South Korea from 1954, when the agreement was signed [as 
heard], up until today. Still, it had brought them secretly. 
However, it is now openly bringing in operational materials and 
military personnel in broad daylight. The Apache attack 
helicopters and Patriot missiles were recently deployed in this 
fashion. Needless to day, all of these are violations of the 
Korean armistice agreement. 
  When traitor Kim Yong-sam took issue regarding the armistice 
agreement, he should have taken issue with these violations 
first. 
  Regarding the establishment of a new peace-guaranteeing 
system on the Korean peninsula, which we proposed in the Foreign 
Ministry's statement, traitor Kim Yong-sam, poking his nose into 
this matter, is trying to do something about it. This is a very 
foolish act. 
  How can a colonial puppet who is neither a signatory to the 
Korean armistice agreement, nor one who has the prerogative of 
supreme command over the armed forces, can sit face to face with 
us and discuss the issue of replacing the armistice agreement 
with a peace agreement? This is nonsense. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam again made the meaningless remarks this 
time that North Korea was developing nuclear weapons and 
violated the armistice agreement. As I have stated, this is a 
scheme to divert the South Korean people's attention elsewhere 
because of an internal crisis. 
  The South Korean puppets are launching a smear campaign 
while 
saying that someone is developing nuclear weapons and violating 
the armistice agreement. Instead of doing so, they had better 
mind their own business. The smear campaign which reverses 
facts can never produce good results. 
  Only destruction awaits the Kim Yong-sam ring, which 
aggravates North-South relations, strains tension on the Korean 
peninsula, and leads the country to ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring 
is walking down a path of self-destruction.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today urges 
the South Korean rulers to immediately stop the development of a 
fast breeder reactor, open to the public the truth behind their 
secret development of nuclear weapons and apologize to the 
nation. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The May 2 white paper of the Central Committee of the South 
Korean National Democratic Front on the truth and purpose of the 
South Korean rulers' development of a fast breeder reactor is 
another stern indictment against their development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  To tell the truth, the economic advantage and stability of 
the fast breeder reactor are not guaranteed in the world. That 
is why other countries which built reactors of this type have 
suspended their operation or closed them. 
  The South Korean puppets' desperate efforts to develop a 
fast 
breeder reactor are directly linked with their ambition for 
nuclear arms development. Through the development of the 
reactor, they plan to secure large quantities of plutonium and 
possess reprocessing facilities. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam signed an agreement on joint 
nuclear 
development with Japan some time ago. The South Korean puppets 
hosted an "international symposium on the reactors of the next 
generation" in Seoul in October last year, where they wrested a 
promise from some officials of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency to "cooperate in the development of the next-generation 
reactor in South Korea." 
  Facts prove that the South Korean rulers' development of 
nuclear weapons has reached a very dangerous stage. 
  It is all the more disgusting that the South Korean rulers 
are continuously making a fuss over "suspected nuclear arms 
development" of the North while promoting their own nuclear arms 
development in secrecy. With a view to concealing its criminal 
acts, the Kim Yong-sam clique is doing all evils as a shock 
brigade in the "campaign for pressure" on the DPRK. This 
reminds us of "the guilty party filing the suit first." 
  So long as such fellows are left alone, the disaster of 
nuclear war cannot be avoided nor can the North-South relations 
be improved. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group continues developing nuclear 
weapons, it will be held wholly responsible for all the 
consequences arising therefrom.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
blared on May 4 that their "patience reached the limit" with 
regard to "the nuclear development of the North." 
  Commenting on his remarks, MINJU CHOSON today says he must 
stop the development of nuclear weapons in South Korea, instead 
of charging others. 
  The analyst says: 
  In South Korea large quantities of plutonium enough for the 
manufacture of hundreds of nuclear bombs have been extracted 
from the pressurized heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok. Nevertheless, Kim 
Yong-sam is now hysterically crying over "the nuclear 
development" by the North, revealing his true color as a traitor 
to the nation. 
  The traitor spoke ill of the peace overture made by the DPRK 
to the United States recently, alleging that the North "withdrew 
from the armistice commission" and it "is isolated." His 
preposterous jargon was aimed at balking the DPRK-U.S. 
negotiation, having the hostile relations maintained between the 
DPRK and the U.S., and stifling the North with the backing of 
outside forces. 
  The analyst further says: 
  His remarks are, in a nutshell, a thoughtless sophism of a 
fellow bereft of reason. 
  The traitor, who is rejected by the people for his 
despicable 
policy of dependence on outside forces, North-South 
confrontation, irregularities and fighting within the quarters 
of power, made such remarks in the hope of diverting elsewhere 
the resentment directed at him. But, nobody takes him at his 
words.

<F P=106> ["Unpardonable Jargon of Japanese Justice Minister" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister 
of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, when interviewed by 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN on May 3, openly let out an ugly torrent of 
words defending the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression in 
the past. 
  Contending that "it is wrong to say the Pacific war" started 
by the Japanese imperialists "was a war of aggression," he went 
to the extent where he claimed without hesitation that the war 
was "a war for the liberation of colonies" and "a just war which 
may be tolerated." And he driveled that a notorious massacre by 
the Japanese imperialists in Nanjing, China, was a hoax. 
  Nagano's shameless remarks are nonsensical outbursts for 
bringing the spectre of Japanese militarism back to life. 
  Peoples of many Asian countries including Korea shed blood 
and died tragic deaths and underwent immeasurable misfortunes 
and sufferings due to the war of aggression provoked by the 
Japanese imperialists. This is a hard fact recorded in history 
and still vivid in the memory of people as bitter grievances. 
  The Japanese authorities must apologize and compensate for 
the war crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against 
Korean and Asian peoples in the past. It is a downright 
challenge never to be condoned to defend and justify the war of 
aggression by the Japanese imperialists, far from making apology 
and compensation. 
  It is by no means accidental that Nagano's grave remarks 
came 
at a time when the Japanese reactionaries, in conspiracy with 
the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, are driving 
the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, while 
the anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it is getting more open over 
its fictitious "nuclear problem". 
  In justifying the past war crimes of the Japanese 
imperialists the Japanese reactionaries are foolishly attempting 
to justify their moves to stage a comeback to Korea and Asia for 
the realization of the old dream of "the greater east Asia 
coprosperity sphere". We cannot overlook the open remarks of a 
high-placed official holding the post of justice minister 
intended to make a clean sheet of and even justify the cursed 
history of aggression of the Japanese imperialists. 
  The Japanese authorities must show a responsible attitude 
and 
a position of apology for this.

  [Text] The building of the Nungna suspension 
bridge--another proud creation of the era of the Workers' 
Party--which is underway in conformity with our party's grand 
plan--is being pushed ahead vigorously. 
  To provide our people with a more wonderful and cultural 
living condition, the supreme commander General Kim Chong-il has 
himself initiated the building of the Nungna suspension bridge. 
He has shown a great trust by entrusting this honorable task to 
the soldiers of the Korean People's Army unit to which Comrade 
(Kang Chin-sop) belongs. 
  All the soldiers, boundlessly encouraged by supreme 
commander 
General Kim Chong-il's great trust and warm affection, have been 
registering new upsurges day in and day out in the building of 
the bridge . 
  The soldiers have already finished within a short period of 
time the large-scale construction, including setting up the 
bridge's piers and (?erecting beams). They have set a goal to 
build several crane units on their own by highly displaying the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude to resolve 
everything with one's own strength even if the higher echelons 
do not supply the necessities, although it would be better if 
the higher echelons did supply them. They have achieved a 
breakthrough in the construction by finally building the cranes, 
while actively seeking out inner reserves, putting together 
strength and wisdom, and successfully solving pending technical 
problems. 
  At the present moment, the soldiers are markedly increasing 
the speed of the construction with a high conviction of victory.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "The Khmer Rouge Group Has Used an </F>
Obsolete Pretext To Further the Destructive War Against the 
Nation"] 
  [Text] The long letter of the Khmer Rouge group to His 
Majesty on 3 May is clear evidence that the group does not want 
to heed the sacred king father's initiative calling for an 
on-the-spot cease- fire between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces and 
the Khmer Rouge. In the letter, although the Khmer Rouge 
strives to show that it wants the cease-fire -- which 
constitutes a step toward national reconciliation, peace, and 
compromise -- Khieu Samphan spends a large part of the message 
detailing a vague description. This has prompted His Majesty to 
complain that he does not know what the Khmer Rouge want to have 
or do. The king also says that he does not know whether the 
Khmer Rouge rejects or supports his proposal. It is clear that 
the Khmer Rouge has painstakingly raised the obsolete pretext 
that it has been using for years in order to shun the cease- 
fire and refuse to enter the roundtable meeting to solve 
problems peacefully. It is well known that for over a decade 
the Khmer Rouge, using Vietnam as a pretext, has totally 
destroyed monasteries, Buddhist monks' quarters, stupas, roads, 
bridges, trains, schools, and hospitals. It has massacred 
children, elderly persons, women, and our people in rural areas 
without mercy. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge has also alleged that 
the Paris Accord of 23 October 1991 mapped out with the 
international community's support is a Vietnamese scheme. It 
contemptuously trampled upon the accord. It not only refused to 
cease firing, demobilize its troops, and lay down its arms, but 
it also fired at UNTAC and called the latter YUONTAC [derogatory 
word for UNTAC]. The Khmer Rouge also calls the royal 
government, which has come into being as a result of the 
people's wish through the elections organized and supervised by 
the United Nations, a Vietnamese puppet government. 
  In its latest letter, the Khmer Rouge has sternly charged 
that the subsistence of the two-headed government is maintained 
only by the communist Vietnamese's muscle and force. This 
constitutes a show of utter contempt for the people's wish and 
displays scorn for the king, who approved the government lineup 
last year. Most seriously, the Khmer Rouge has charged that the 
three conditions raised by the royal government in keeping with 
the king's 21 November 1993 three-point proposal are part of a 
Vietnamese scheme. It seems that the Khmer Rouge tends to 
insolently regard the king's proposal as a Vietnamese scheme as 
well. This is really an intolerable action. Moreover, the 
on-the-spot cease-fire is based on the clear-sighted initiative 
of the king; so why did the Khmer Rouge wildly accuse it of 
being a poisonous trick of the royal government. 
  In sum, it can be seen that the Khmer Rouge, drunk with its 
sense of identity with the people, has regarded those outside 
its group as Vietnamese, whom it intends to destroy completely. 
The Khmer Rouge has used the Vietnamese issue as a pretext to 
continue the destructive war against the nation. Vietnam is a 
label used by the Khmer Rouge as a pretext to massacre the 
people. At a meeting with Buddhist monks, senior citizens, 
nuns, and his children in front of the Chan Chhaya pavilion on 4 
May, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman said Vietnam should 
not further be used as a pretext to continue the war and that 
one should understand that the present war is a war between 
Cambodians. His Majesty added that those using any pretext 
whatever to prolong war are all national traitors, who are 
endangering the nation and bringing about a loss of Cambodia's 
independence, territorial integrity, and race. This being so, 
the Khmer Rouge, which always boasts about its patriotism, 
should feel humiliated and stop using the obsolete and base 
pretext to continue its political and military ambition. It 
should turn to talking about the reality with veracity and 
equity.

  [Excerpt] On 4 May, the people, in cooperation with the 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], successfully 
attacked the 11th Division, which was made up of the communist 
Vietnamese and U.S.-backed puppets, in the Kulen district seat. 
The people and NADK also jointly attacked the invading forces 
at various positions in Kulen District and others in Preah 
Vihear Province. 
  This was retaliation against the invasion by the communist 
Vietnamese and U.S.-backed puppets against the NADK and 
Cambodian people. 
  After two days of fighting on 3 and 4 May, the people and 
NADK have smashed and completely liberated the area around the 
11th Division. They currently occupy the Kulen district seat.

  [Text] On the morning of 4 May, Ke Kimyan, ancillary 
commander of the communist Vietnamese puppets and chief of the 
General Staff of the two-headed government, issued an order to 
all armed units of the communist Vietnamese and American puppets 
on battlefields throughout the country. The following is the 
content of Ke Kimyan's order: 
  Top secret message: 
  1. The royal government will declare the implementation of a 
cease-fire. This declaration is only of a political nature. 
Militarily, the situation remains unchanged. All armed units 
should grasp the political trick of our royal government. 
  2. All armed units and military regions should continue to 
intensify their military activities to fight the Khmer Rouge 
ceaselessly. 
  3. As for our political and military objectives, they remain 
totally intact. This is only a tactic to enable us to have time 
to reorganize and muster forces and prepare weapons to 
counterattack the Khmer Rouge. 
  4. This is a direct order from Samdech Kromluong [title as 
heard] Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen. 
  [Signed] Ke Kimyan, chief of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
General Staff. 
  Note: We do not need to comment on the content of the above 
message. 
  [Dated] 4 May 1994.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia does not want the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to become a forum through 
which certain countries can fulfill their ambitions of obtaining 
unilateral benefits after failing to achieve this at the 
recently concluded Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. 
  Minister of Trade Sastro B. Judono told reporters after 
meeting with President Suharto here yesterday said that APEC on 
the contrary, should be a forum where countries with advanced 
economies and those with developing economies can cooperate to 
improve their overall economic well being. 
  Judono was commenting on the new problems which he said had 
emerged following the signing of the Final Act of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakech, Morocco. 
  He said the problem -- which he referred to as "new forms of 
protectionist measures" -- were mainly caused by the intention 
of several industrialized countries to include non-trade issues 
in the global trade rules. 
  "Cooperation will encourage developing economies to grow 
faster and will narrow the widening gap between the rich and 
poor countries. This will promote keener competitiveness," he 
said. 
  Judono, who was accompanied by Coordinating Minister for 
Industry and Trade Hartarto and Minister/State Secretary 
Murdiono, pointed out that before such a state of equilibrium 
could be achieved, there would be no use talking about free 
trade in the region, since that would only encourage unbalanced 
trade. 
  "APEC should not immediately be turned into a free-trade 
zone 
because a certain period for cooperation is required to 
gradually develop the member countries before they finally reach 
a high level of competitiveness, allowing free trade to 
proceed," he said. 
  Commenting on the Marrakech meeting, which he attended, 
Judono explained that Indonesia has five years -- or until 1997 
-- to adjust its regulations that require foreign investors to 
utilize local products. 
  "Indonesia and several other countries have yet to remove 
their regulations which are not in line with the new GATT 
rules," he said. 
  In the implementation of international intellectual property 
rights -- concerning copyrights, patents, trademarks, design 
rights and the right of trade secrecy -- Judono said it was 
agreed that all signatories would adjust their respective 
regulations to the international norms.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Indonesian Foreign Minister </F>
Ali Alatas by TEMPO correspondent Fikri Jufri in New York -- 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Jufri] To what extent has progress to solve the 
East Timor issue at the international forums been made? 
  [Alatas] There has been no breakthrough through the formal 
tripartite talks involving Indonesia, the United Nations, and 
Portugal. The talks are not stalled, but progress has been made 
at a very slow pace. We are now discussing the issue of CBM or 
Confidence Building Measures. 
  However, outside the formal tripartite talks, several 
breakthroughs have been made. The first breakthrough occurred 
last year with the establishment of EPIFA or European Parliament 
Indonesia Friendship Association]. We certainly welcome the 
establishment of this association, which was able to thwart 
Portugal's motions at the European Parliament. The second 
breakthrough took place even within Portugal itself with the 
establishment of the Portugal-Indonesia Friendship Association 
by Macedo and his friends. While business was the initial 
motivation, the association later also engaged in political 
activities. We certainly welcome this development. The third 
breakthrough occurred was when Araujo, a former leader of 
Fretilin [Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor] now 
living in Portugal, decided to contact us and expressed his wish 
to meet with his old friends in Indonesia. Of course we had to 
double check his sincerity, and it turned out that he was 
sincere. We certainly welcomed his initiative. 
  [Jufri] If that is the case, why do we still hear protests 
on 
East Timor? 
  [Alatas] The protests come from those who feel they are 
being cornered, namely the hardline group opposed to Araujo's 
initiative. Who are these people? They are Ramos Horta and his 
friends, who are supported by the Allan Nairn group. I also 
believe that the film entitled Pilger was produced in a hurry so 
it could be shown before the annual meeting of the UN Commission 
on Human Rights in Geneva. This is understandable becuse they 
are worried about the impact of the breakthroughs mentioned 
above. Therefore, we are now in a unique situation: On the one 
hand, we see bright prospects, but on the other hand, we also 
notice that our opponents are also intensifying their activities. 
  [Jufri] Do you think that the upcoming meeting of the 
Indonesian community in the United States organized by the Asia 
Society will produce another breakthrough in that country? 
  [Alatas] It is hoped that the meeting will be able to 
introduce Indonesia in its totality to the U.S. society, 
especially to those whose knowledge on Indonesia are limited to 
issues like human rights and environment. This meeting is aimed 
at approaching not only the U.S. Congress, but also the U.S. 
media, which are responsible for building public opinion. 
  [Jufri] Therefore, this meeting is a kind of public 
diplomacy? 
  [Alatas] Yes, because present-day foreign diplomacy is no 
longer restricted to traditional diplomatic forums.

  [Excerpt] This afternoon Foreign Minister Squadron Leader 
Prasong Sunsiri called on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, 
reportedly to discuss the issue of a member of parliament being 
involved in narcotics trafficking. Speaking to reporters 
afterward, the prime minister said he requested that the foreign 
minister ask the U.S. Embassy for information concerning the 
activities of the MP in question. He pointed out that the 
accused, Thanong, has not been proven guilty: 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] Based on the information we have, 
at this time he is not being regarded as having committed any 
wrongdoing. Therefore, we must find out what the facts are. In 
my meeting with the foreign minister this morning, we decided to 
request the U.S. Embassy's cooperation in supplying us with 
information. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What did he report to you? 
  [Chuan] After the news broke, we received information that 
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had requested that 
notices be delivered to three people -- whose names were given 
-- to inform them that their assets in the United States would 
be seized. The notices -- sent by the supreme attorney general 
-- were delivered to two of these people. The third person 
could not be reached and the letter was mailed to him. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said he would instruct the 
Ministry permanent secretary to request information from the 
U.S. Embassy. He said the accusation not only damaged the 
accused but also the country's reputation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Regarding the case that the United States has 
issued a warrant demanding a Thai member of House of 
Representatives to make clarification on a narcotics trafficking 
charge against him and U.S. authorities have frozen the assets 
in the United States of the said suspect, Foreign Affairs 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri this morning met with 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to inform him of what the Foreign 
Ministry would do next on this matter. The foreign minister told 
reporters after his meeting with the prime minister that he will 
contact the U.S. Embassay for further information. The matter 
also has adverse effects on the parliamentary institution and 
Thai people, and the Thai Government has not been idle on the 
matter, said Prasong. Regarding this, the Foreign Ministry has 
always followed up on the developments since it was first 
informed on 12 January 1993. The Office of the Supreme 
Aattorney-General has reported on the matter to the Foreign 
Ministry and also notified the suspect and his colleagues of 
their wrong-doings, telling them to give explanations to the 
court in the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong] I will contact the U.S. Embassy 
for further information, because once an accusation is made 
against a Thai, it also affects all the others -- both the 
parliamentary institution and the country as a whole. Therefore, 
I would like to know about the additional information and 
evidence. I will contact the U.S. Embassy, because it used to 
contact the Foreign Affairs Ministry before on this. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Sir, when did they first inform us 
of 
the matter? 
  [Prasong] Around 12 January 1993. However, they [U.S. 
authorities] have followed up this case for nearly 10 years, 
according to a report. 
  [Reporter] Sir, [words indistinct] what action will you 
take? 
  [Prasong] This is the responsibility of the authorities. I 
myself will coordinate the Office of Narcotics Control Board and 
police authorities in charge of narcotics work to give them 
information. 
  [Reporter] As an MP [Member of Parliament], what would you 
say about on this? 
  [Prasong] It is up to the House of Representatives to 
consider. [end recording]

  [Text] The House committee overseeing MPs' conduct 
yesterday vowed to push for the ouster of Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong if he failed to clear himself of charges that he 
was involved in smuggling marijuana into the United States. 
  The House committee on parliamentary affairs plans to hold a 
meeting on Thanong next Tuesday but has tried unsuccessfully to 
contact the MP, whose testimony is essential before the panel 
can come to a decision. 
  Committee chairman Charoen Khanthawong said if the panel 
concluded that Thanong had damaged Parliament's reputation it 
would campaign for his ouster as MP. 
  "If we consider him to be guilty, the House committee will 
invoke article 93 to oust him," said Charoen. 
  Under article 93 of the Constitution an MP who tarnishes the 
reputation of Parliament can be ousted by a three-quarters 
majority vote, or 270 of the 360 members of the House. 
  The motion would require the support of at least one-third 
of 
House or 120 members, before it could be submitted. 
  Thanong has been accused of conspiring to smuggle more than 
45 tonnes of marijuana into the United States, and his American 
assets have been frozen by a California court. 
  "I think Thanong should resign to clear up all problems. An 
MP has previously resigned from the House after he being found 
to be involved in corruption," Charoen (Democratic-Bangkok) said. 
  Charoen said he had called an urgent committee meeting on 
Tuesday at Parliament to discuss the matter and there would be 
an opportunity for Thanong to make an explanation. 
  "I'm not so sure Thanong will show up. The committee has 
been unable to contact him," the committee chairman said. 
  He said if Thanong was found guilty MPs could ask the House 
of Representatives to consider the matter promptly, without 
having to wait for the House committee to submit a motion. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina said before leaving for 
the United States yesterday that Thailand may permit Thanong's 
extradition to the US for trial. 
  Senior Thai officials said Washington had not yet requested 
Thanong's extradition. 
  Den was invited to the US by the Drug Enforcement Agency 
[DEA] to discuss antidrug trafficking measures before Thanong's 
case was publicized. 
  He told reporters at Don Muang Airport the DEA will give him 
all information relating to Thanong's case. He was uncertain 
whether US authorities had issued an arrest warrant for 
Thanong's extradition. 
  Although Thailand has an extradition agreement with the 
United States, part of the agreement states that Thai 
authorities can take legal action against a suspect arrested 
here, Pol. Gen. Prathin said. 
  The opposition Chat Thai Party has played down Thanong's 
case 
as a "personal affair", but indicated it would expel him if 
presented with solid evidence. 
  Chat Thai MP Newin Chitchop said his party would definitely 
sack Thanong if he was found guilty. 
  He admitted that press reports about Thanong affected the 
party's image. 
  "However, I think this is a personal matter and has nothing 
to do with the party. Actually, there are good and bad people 
in every institution," Newin said. 
  Chongchai Thiangtham (Chat Thai-Suphan Buri) yesterday 
accused government MPs of releasing the news to the public in a 
bid to discredit the opposition. 
  "This is an old issue that we have known of for a long time. 
But I don't know why it is publicized now," he said. 
  "I think this is similar to the previous case when they 
wanted to discredit Narong," he said. 
  US drug allegations forced Narong Wongwan, a Chat Thai Party 
adviser to withdraw his premiership candidacy in March 1992. 
Narong strongly denied the accusations. 
  Chongchai said Thanong should explain himself to the public 
as soon as possible. 
  He said Thanong had not contacted the party since the 
charges 
against him were made public. Nor had the party been able to 
contact him because he had many houses in Nakhon Panom, Chiang 
Rai and Phatthaya and other places, he added. 
  Suwat Liptaphanlop, secretary-general of the Chat Phatthana 
Party, said the charges against Thanong were unlikely to affect 
the opposition's unity because it was a personal matter. 
  However, if Thanong was found guilty the Parliament's image 
would suffer. The opposition would discuss the issue next week, 
he said. 
  Senior government officials yesterday denied claims the 
government was just drumming up a previously unattended issue to 
discredit the opposition which is planning to launch a censure 
offensive against the Chuan administration. 
  "We never have such an idea using Thanong's case to 
discredit 
the opposition in our head," said Democrat Secretary-General 
Sanan Khachonprasat. 
  Deputy Agriculture Minister Suthep Thuaksuban, a Democrat 
MP, 
said the government would "never become involved in any 
political ploy". But he added all MPs should help to protect 
the reputation of the House and all political parties should see 
to it that their members observe ethical principles. 
  Pol. Maj. Gen Chaowalit Yotmani, chief of the Office of 
Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], confirmed that Thanong's case 
was not being used as a political tool. 
  "If the opposition wants the ONCB to clarify the issue, we 
are willing to do so," he said. 
  Kraisak Chunhawan said Thanong must be arrested if police 
have enough evidence to back charges against him.

  [Text] Talking to reporters at the National Assembly this 
afternoon, Thanong Siriprichaphong, an MP from Nakhon Phanom 
Province, insisted that he is innocent of all drug charges. He 
is gathering evidence to clarify the issue with all parties 
concerned: 
  [Begin recording] [Thanong] I consulted with the people in 
Nakhon Phanom and the Chat Thai Party about resigning as an MP 
as soon as I heard the news reports. They told me there was no 
need to resign. I deny the charges; I insist that I am innocent 
of all charges. As soon as I learned of the news, I contacted 
my lawyer to fight the charges. I learned about the charges 
from newspaper, radio, and television reports. The house and 
the assets are not in my name. I am checking on what I am being 
charged with -- maybe it has to do with failing to pay the house 
mortgage. I am gathering evidence. I still do not know what I 
am being charged with. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Thanong] I will clear the parliamentary issue. I will not 
allow the image of the House of Representatives, the Chat Thai 
Party, or the people of Nakhon Phanom to be damaged. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Police cannot take legal action against MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong, who has been accused by a US court of smuggling 
drugs into the United States, because the charges were brought 
against him outside Thailand, police chief Prathin Santipraphop 
said yesterday. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had not yet 
been 
briefed by US officials and could not act at this stage. 
  On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Bangkok said in a statement 
that Thanong (Chat Thai-Nakhon Phanom) had been involved in 
successful and foiled attempts to smuggle more than 45 metric 
tons of marijuana into the country. 
  Thanong allegedly received about $10 million from drug 
trafficking between 1977 and 1987. His assets in the United 
States have been seized by a US court order, according to the 
statement. 
  Prathin said there was no automatic requirement for 
Thanong's 
extradition to the States. If it was requested by the US 
government, police would have to carefully consider how the law 
here applied to the case. Thai police may be able to oversee 
the case themselves, Prathin said. 
  It would be up to Parliament to approve Thanong's arrest if 
a 
warrant was issued. An MP cannot be arrested during a 
parliamentary session without the approval of Parliament. 
  Asked why police had taken no action against Thanong, even 
though he had long been a suspect, Prathin said police must be 
careful not to violate personal rights. 
  Police could make an arrest only when they had substantive 
evidence, he said. Police have lists of probable criminals and 
"influential" people, but they could not reveal them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make The Facts Clear"] </F>
  [Text] There is a rumor that a U.S. Government office has 
seized assets in San Francisco worth some 30 million baht 
belonging to Thanong Siriprichaphong, a member of parliament 
from Nakhon Phanom. To date no one -- including the Thai 
Government and the Office of Narcotics Control Board -- has been 
able to confirm or deny the rumor. 
  We feel the Thai Government and the House of Representatives 
have a duty to clear up the facts on this issue. This is 
because regardless of whether the rumor is true, the MP's party 
and the House will suffer damage, as will the country's 
reputation. Even if the seizure of assets did take place, the 
question of whether the MP's conduct conforms with the 
accusation is another matter. 
  The concerned U.S. authorities may have seized the assets in 
line with the relevant U.S. law, but it does not mean we have to 
believe the U.S. accusation is true. On the contrary, the Thai 
Government must carry out its own inquiry to provide justice to 
a Thai citizen. In this context, the U.S. Administration's role 
in dealing with the Singapore Government in the case of a caning 
sentence against a U.S. citizen is no different. 
  It is strange that the Thai Government does not seem to be 
paying much attention to this issue. This is evident in the 
fact that it was the private news agency INN that broke the 
news, and no Thai agency has been able to confirm or deny the 
story. This is despite the fact that the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board maintains regular contact with the DEA [Drug 
Enforcement Agency] to exchange information on the arrest of 
narcotics traffickers. We wonder what the government has been 
doing, or whether it is considering using this issue as a 
political weapon to cover up the bombing reports or discourage 
the opposition's planned no-confidence motion. 
  It is becoming a joke that instead of benefiting from this, 
the government could be suspected of planting the rumor or using 
it to subdue the opposition. We feel that if the government 
promptly verifies the story and clears up the facts it will gain 
credit. If the Nakhon Phanom MP is guilty as charged, no one 
can help him.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai Parliament Must Be Free of Narcotics"] </F>
  [Text] A Thai member of parliament has gained notoriety 
after being accused by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
of involvement in the international drug trafficking movement. 
As a result, his assets in the United States have been seized 
and his name blacklisted as persona non grata by the United 
States. It has become major news in view of the current 
political situation in Thailand. 
  It can be said that this sort of notoriety is nothing new. 
In the past, several MP's have faced similar charges in 
Australia and Hong Kong; some were even imprisoned abroad based 
on those convictions. 
  An MP who was a former political party leader and a one-time 
candidate for prime minister lost any chance of becoming a 
national political leader because the United States accused him 
of involvement in narcotics trafficking and declared him persona 
non grata. No details were ever given about his alleged 
activities. It became a big story after a report citing a 
Foreign Ministry official or an official of the embassy 
concerned was made public. The story gradually faded away, and 
whoever was concerned with the issue -- whether Thai or 
foreigner -- never provided any details to clear up the 
resulting confusion. 
  In the latest case, a USIS release claims that the DEA 
provided the Thai Government with a chronology of the Thai MP's 
trafficking activities dating back to 1977 and sought assistance 
in gathering information on the MP's background and assets. 
This was to facilitate the DEA's appeal in a California 
district court to seize the MP's assets. The release also noted 
that a house in Los Angeles and a Mercedes 560 SL were assets 
the MP acquired with profits made by smuggling narcotics into 
the United States beginning in 1977, when the MP started 
smuggling shipments of one or two tons. In mid- 1987, U.S. 
Customs officials seized a shipment. 
  Although it is merely an accusation, we believe many people 
feel this causes great damage to Thailand. In particular, the 
honor and prestige of the House of Representatives -- which is a 
major institution in Thai society -- have been damaged because 
one of its members has been accused of conduct that 
international society and the United States have been trying to 
suppress. 
  Therefore, we appeal to the president of the House and the 
leader of the party the MP in question belongs to: Take 
responsibility in this notorious issue by undertaking an inquiry 
with the DEA and bringing the MP in person to clarify the 
matter. In this way the people's skepticism can be cleared up.

fighting is expected in Cambodia before the onset of the rainy

before the onset of the rainy season. Therefore, I would remind 
people living in Aranyaprathet District opposite Poipet to be 
careful. [end recording] 
  Anuson also said that Thai forces along the border are alert 
and have carried out exercises, particularly to conduct 
evacuations if the fighting in Cambodia so warrants.

  [Text] According to a news dispatch, there was fighting 
along the Thai-Cambodian border opposite Sa Kaeo Province. 
Khmer Rouge soldiers attacked Cambodian Government forces at 
Sra Kradan and the Poipet market, killing one government soldier 
and six villagers and wounding six others at a Poipet market. 
  The fighting took place about five KM from the Thai border. 
Some 1,000 Cambodians attempted to cross into Thai territory at 
Ban Wangmon and Ban Khok Sabang of Aranyaprathep District, Sa 
Kaeo Province as a result of the fighting. However, Thai 
soldiers at the border area did not allow them to enter the Thai 
soil. 
  Thach Koan, deputy governor of Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey 
Province, said that there were no casualties on the part of the 
government. He also added that there were no Khmer Rouge 
soldiers in Poipet. Cambodian forces seized four Khmer Rouge 
tanks. He said that he would talk with Thai officials on 
reopening a border checkpoint in the next 10 days. 
  Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaisit said that the closure of the 
border checkpoint has affected the merchants. The two sides 
will try to reopen it as soon as possible. The governor of 
Banteay Beanchey sent a letter through the Thai-Cambodian Border 
Coordination Office asking for the talks. The talks are set to 
be held in Thailand on 10 May.

  [Text] The U.S. House of Representatives has voted for 
Vietnam. From this issue, our radio editor has this to say: 
  On 20 April, after considering reports by the U.S. Senate 
and 
House on the appropriation bill for activities of the State 
Department and other agencies in the 1994-95 fiscal year, the 
House of Representatives voted against the proposal of 
Representative [name indistinct] opposing the Senate's (?praise) 
of the Vietnamese Government's good cooperation in the 
settlement of the MIA issue and the U.S. President's lifting of 
the embargo against Vietnam. Before voting, Representative 
[name indistinct] asked the representatives of the committee not 
to agree with the Senate's assessment. However, some 
representatives rejected [name indistinct] statement, saying 
that the President's decision to lift the embargo was correct. 
  Representative Peterson, Democrat from Florida, held that it 
is unacceptable to think of retaliation now. He said it is high 
time to seek solutions. Finally, with 209 votes against, [name 
indistinct] proposal has been rejected. Most of the 
representatives voted for the U.S. Senate's assessment on 
Vietnam's good cooperation in the MIA issue and affirmed the 
support to President Clinton's decision to lift the embargo on 
Vietnam. 
  This was the first time that U.S. House of Representatives 
voted for Vietnam issue following the Senate voting asking for 
the President to lift the embargo on Vietnam on 27 January 1994. 
This event expressed the current common trend of development in 
the United States -- advancing toward normalization of relations 
with Vietnam in the interests of both the United States and 
Vietnam and the common trend in the world for peace, 
cooperation, and development. 
  In fact, following the U.S. decision to lift the embargo on 
Vietnam, both sides exchanged views on the setting up of liaison 
offices and other issues of common concern. 
  In an interview with the Paper TUOI TRE [Youth], Vietnamese 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: Recent talks at 
different levels between Vietnam and the United States produced 
good results. In the near future, the United States and Vietnam 
will set up liaison offices in Hanoi and in Washington. 
Moreover, American companies which have arrived in Vietnam to 
sign contracts prior to the lifting of the embargo now start to 
implement their projects. Besides, more and more American 
companies wish to invest in Vietnam for its economic 
development. The Vietnamese diplomat said he believes that both 
the countries will sooner or later set up diplomatic relations 
at ambassadorial level.

  [Text] As reported earlier, President Le Duc Anh has 
successfully ended his official friendship visit. Here is the 
review to the Vietnam-Iran relationship: 
  The official friendship visit to Iran by Vietnamese 
President 
Le Duc Anh marked the turning point in bilateral relationship. 
On this occasion, the Vietnamese president held talks with his 
Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and called on 
a number of economic and cultural establishments in the Iranian 
capital. The two countries have also signed a trade agreement, 
an agreement on visa exemption for citizens of the two countries 
during diplomatic passport, and an agreement providing for the 
setting up of the inter-governmental Commission for Economic, 
Scientific, Technological, Cultural, and Trade Cooperation. 
  Vietnam and Iran have set up diplomatic relations at the 
ambassadorial level since 1973, and bilateral relationship has 
been developing in recent years. The two sides have exchanged a 
number of delegations for the view to strengthening mutual 
understanding for further cooperation. Leaders of the two 
countries stated that Vietnam and Iran have many things in 
common, including advantages and potentials for further 
development of bilateral cooperation. The Iranian president 
said: The first visit to Iran by Vietnamese President Le Duc 
Anh was a good opportunity for the two sides to exchange 
experiences. For his part, 'Ali Hoseyni Ayatollah Khamene'i 
described his satisfaction at what have been achieved, 
considering them initial but firm foundation for long term 
cooperation between Iran and Vietnam. Ayatollah Khamene'i added 
that besides, the two countries should exchange students to 
study languages of both countries. 
  In his talks with Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam, 
Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati said that Iran would prepare 
for the construction of Vietnamese embassy in Tehran. Iranian 
president proposed to organize an exhibition of Iran in Vietnam, 
and vice versa, so that the people of the two countries can have 
better mutual understanding. 
  President Le Duc Anh's visit to Iran resulted in a number of 
agreements signed between the two governments marking a new step 
of development in the relationship and cooperation between 
Vietnam and Iran.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by station </F>
correspondent Truong Cong Hoa; place, date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Dear Minister: You just accompanied 
President Le Duc Anh on an official friendship visit to 
Indonesia and Iran. Would you please appraise the results of 
these visits? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] These two countries have some similar 
features but have different approaches in their relations with 
Vietnam. First, Indonesia and Iran are both active members of 
the Nonaligned Movement. Indonesia, as chairman of the 
Movement, has made great efforts in carrying out its activities. 
Second, these two countries have great potential for economic 
development. The two nations share the same aspiration to 
expand relations with Vietnam in various aspects. 
  Indonesia has maintained long-standing relations with 
Vietnam; it has been almost four decades since the establishment 
of consulates general between the two nations. During this 
period, Vietnam-Indonesia relations have developed consistently 
in various fields. Although this relationship has sometimes 
declined, it has developed vigorously following President 
Suharto's official visit to Vietnam in late 1990 and Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet's official friendship visit to Indonesia in 
October 1991. Since then, Vietnam's relations with Indonesia 
and the other ASEAN countries have shifted to a new era -- an 
era of cooperation and development. Over the past two or more 
years, these relations have developed rapidly. The value of 
goods exchanged between the two countries reached $255 million 
in 1993, compared to $192 million in 1991. Regarding economic 
cooperation, Indonesian businesses have invested in various 
projects in Vietnam and have been granted licenses [words 
indistinct]. In addition, the two countries have expanded 
cooperation in the fields of culture, science, and national 
defense. 
  We have had relations with Iran for over 20 years -- since 
1973. In the past we have not have much activity in economic and 
trade cooperation because of unfavorable geographical 
conditions. Over the past few years, however, our trade 
relations with Iran have improved remarkably. 
  President Le Duc Anh's visit to Indonesia and Iran was aimed 
at strengthening friendship and cooperation with these 
countries, especially Indonesia, with which we have consistently 
maintained a close relationship. As for Iran, through President 
Le Duc Anh's visit we have built a firm basis for developing 
relations with this country. During the meetings between 
President Le Duc Anh and the Indonesian and Iranian presidents, 
as well as meetings between Vietnamese ministers and their 
Indonesian and Iranian counterparts, we focussed on discussing 
ways and means to expand cooperation, especially in the economic 
domain. 
  In Indonesia, the presidents and ministers of the two 
countries contended that economic and trade relations are not 
active enough in view of the political relationship and the 
potential of the two nations. On this basis, the two countries 
agreed that efforts must be made in the future to expand 
cooperation in trade and other domains; first in the exploration 
for oil and gas, then in the exploitation of coal mines, 
maritime products, agriculture, and tourism. In our meetings 
with representatives of Indonesian companies, they expressed 
their readiness to cooperate with Vietnam and participate in 
building various electric power plants in our country. I can 
say that through the visit to Indonesia, we have established a 
basis and an orientation for further development in relations 
between the two countries. To achieve this goal, the two 
countries will sign an agreement in the near future on the 
avoidance of double taxation to create favorable conditions for 
the promotion of business activities between the two countries. 
  In Iran, President Le Duc Anh held talks with his Iranian 
counterpart. Both sides contended that economic and trade 
relations between the two countries are still minimal, although 
the bilateral friendship has developed satisfactorily. As a 
result, both sides should make greater efforts to expand 
cooperation in the economic and trade domains as soon as 
possible. There is a great demand in Iran for rice and tea; 
Iran needs about 500,000 tonnes of rice annually. Both sides 
agreed that Vietnam can export rice to Iran on a regular basis. 
Iran would also like to import a large volume of tea from 
Vietnam. 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam continues] In addition, from Iran we can 
buy such things as cotton and petroleum products, including 
asphalt, chloride, and clinker, which is used in the processing 
of cement. Thus, the two sides have goods for barter trade. 
Economically, the two sides agreed to cooperate in the field of 
gas and oil, as Iran's oil industry is a century old and has 
much experience in this field. Iran is ready to help train 
cadres for us. Iran also wants to help build an oil refinery in 
Vietnam. In addition, Iran is ready to cooperate with us in the 
field of construction, especially the construction of a cement 
factory, based on its experience in this field. Based on our 
suggestion, Iran is very eager to cooperate with us in the 
fields of oil, rubber, tea, and coffee. 
  To make a long story short, Iran is very eager to achieve 
long- term cooperation with us. This means that our president's 
visit to Iran, the first high-level meeting between the two 
countries, laid the foundation for a real and long-term 
relationship between the two countries. It should be noted that 
during this visit we were showered wherever we went with the 
special sentiments of the Iranian leaders and people. Here I 
would like to recall a highly typical remark by Ayatollah 
Khamene'i, Iran's highest spiritual leader, on our people and 
struggle: The Vietnamese people are highly admired because they 
have demonstrated their very heroic fighting spirit. They have 
set a shining example for those nations fighting for 
independence and have contributed greatly to the struggle of the 
world's nations for independence and freedom. Cooperation 
between Vietnam and Iran has a very good basis for development. 
  What should be recalled here is that the summit meetings 
between President Le Duc Anh and Indonesian President Suharto, 
and between President Le Duc Anh and the Iranian president, 
contributed to strengthening the solidarity among members of the 
Nonaligned Movement further so as to realize the Movement's 
common goal of peace, independence, sovereignty, and development 
and to contribute to establishing a new world order. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the 
question of Vietnam joining ASEAN, which was raised during the 
visit to Indonesia? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] The fact that we are joining ASEAN as an 
observer and that we recently participated in a project 
sponsored by an ASEAN committee will inevitably lead to our 
country's participation in ASEAN as a full member. This is a 
logical development in line with the current trend in the region 
as well as the world. Recently, all of the ASEAN leaders have 
expressed their desire to see Vietnam obtain full ASEAN 
membership soon. Because this is compatible with overall 
developments in the region and the world, we must -- with the 
support of the ASEAN members -- be prepared to participate in 
this organization soon as a full member. Just as President 
Suharto said during his exchange of views with President Le Duc 
Anh: Vietnam becoming a full member of ASEAN will be very 
beneficial to regional development. This is compatible with the 
current trend toward regional peace, stability, and cooperation 
and is universally beneficial to the development of all nations 
in the world. 
  [Correspondent] During his visit to Iran, President Le Duc 
Anh was accompanied by a number of Vietnamese businessmen. Is 
this a change in the way our country's leaders work when they go 
abroad? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] In the past, our leaders' overseas trips 
were more politically motivated. In the new situation, overseas 
trips by high level leaders such as the president, prime 
minister, and general secretary will not only have political 
significance -- because they help strengthen the friendship 
between our country and the countries that our leaders visit -- 
they will also have very positive economic significance. As 
economics has become the pressing demand of all nations, visits 
by our government's high level delegations are usually 
accompanied by representatives of various public health 
organizations, corporations, and enterprises. This is because, 
along with high-level meetings, we also need direct contacts 
between corporations. This way we will be able to understand 
the real capabilities of related sectors with which our country 
can achieve cooperation. That is why representatives of the 
corporations dealing in those goods Iran wishes to import from 
us or export to us went along on the trip to Iran. This further 
substantiated the high-level agreements we reached. Of course, 
we could not do much on a visit that only lasted for a few days, 
but at least we established direct contacts to continue our 
exchange of views and spur bilateral cooperation. This is a 
change in our working method that suits the requirements of the 
current situation that is witnessing the growth of various 
countries in the world. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, comrade minister.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 5 KYODO -- Vietnam reacted angrily 
Thursday [5 May] to Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's 
remarks on Japan's part in World War II, saying his comments 
were contrary to historical facts. 
  Nagano's remarks ignored the apologies made by Japanese 
leaders to Asian countries, a foreign minister spokesman said. 
Disapproval will be voiced in many Asian countries 
simultaneously, the spokesman said. 
  Some two million Vietnamese starved to death while Japanese 
troops occupied Vietnam from 1940 and 1945. 
  Last August Vietnam welcomed then Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's recognition of Japan's responsibility for 
World War II. Hosokawa said shortly after assuming office that 
Japan waged "a war of aggression" and it was "a wrong war."

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 5 -- More than 100,000 telephones 
have been installed in this biggest commercial city of the 
country, a four fold increase over the figure in early last 
year. As a result, there are now 3.7 telephones for every 100 
people but this is only one-fifteenth the ratio of European 
countries. 
  According to sources from the city's post and communication 
office, more than USD 50 million has been invested over the past 
year in an automatic exchange system. One of the major projects 
is the installation of an underground cable system. On 
completion the project can provide a million telephones to the 
local subscribers by 2000. 
  The director of the Municipal Telephone Company predicted 
that his company will have 200,000 more subscribers by the end 
of this year. [sentence as received] The number next year is 
expected to be ten times bigger than the 1992 figure. In 
addition, other services have been developed such as cellular 
mobile telephone, trunked radio mobile telephone, and card 
phones. Vietnam plans to have one telephone for every 100 
people next year compared with three telephones per 1,000 
persons at present, and three telephones for every 100 people by 
2000, Said Dang Van Than, general director of the General 
Department of Post and Telecommunications.

  [Text] "The illicit import of raw tobacco (tobacco leaves) 
from across the southwestern border has caused extensive 
confusion, a considerable tax collection shortfall, and has been 
a source of unusually high illegal profit for a number of 
people. Therefore, the state has decided that beginning in 
1994, all the imports of raw tobacco will be put under official 
control. As early as 22 September 1993, the Customs General 
Department issued Notice No. 793/TCHQ-GQ, which points out: 
Those cigarette manufacturing units wishing to import raw 
tobacco from Cambodia must seek quota allocations from the 
Ministry of Commerce and must correctly comply with all 
stipulations of the state governing the import of goods." 
  At the request of the Vietnam Tobacco General Corporation, 
the Ministry of Commerce on 3 February 1994 allowed the general 
corporation to import $10 million worth of raw tobacco. After 
that, the general corporation assigned the Nam Raw Tobacco 
Company (in Thong Nhut district of Dong Nai province) the duty 
to import $2 million worth of raw tobacco. "Nevertheless, in 
late March to early April 1994, this company continued to buy 
large quantities of raw tobacco through their imports beyond the 
quota allocated." 
  In view of this violation, the 3d Market Control Team 
inspected the company and seized over 152 tons of tobacco from 
it. Later, however, the market control team somehow chose to 
put this case into limbo, arguing that "it found only a small 
amount of tobacco -- 4,709 kilos -- kept by the company in 
excess of the quantities of its duty-paid tobacco." 
  After securing the release of its confiscated goods, the 
company again bought 14 truckloads of raw tobacco. This time 
the company's action could not go unoticed by members of the 
C-15 Economic Police Unit who found the company had 98 tons of 
duty-not-paid raw tobacco in its storage. 
  Because the company registered 6,000 dong as the import 
price 
per kilo of tobacco, compared to the real price of between 
18,500-20,000 dong per kilo, it is believed that the company 
"delared the import price of its raw tobacco below the real 
buying price to evade tax."

  [Text] As reported earlier, President Le Duc Anh has 
successfully ended his official friendship visit. Here is the 
review to the Vietnam-Iran relationship: 
  The official friendship visit to Iran by Vietnamese 
President 
Le Duc Anh marked the turning point in bilateral relationship. 
On this occasion, the Vietnamese president held talks with his 
Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and called on 
a number of economic and cultural establishments in the Iranian 
capital. The two countries have also signed a trade agreement, 
an agreement on visa exemption for citizens of the two countries 
during diplomatic passport, and an agreement providing for the 
setting up of the inter-governmental Commission for Economic, 
Scientific, Technological, Cultural, and Trade Cooperation. 
  Vietnam and Iran have set up diplomatic relations at the 
ambassadorial level since 1973, and bilateral relationship has 
been developing in recent years. The two sides have exchanged a 
number of delegations for the view to strengthening mutual 
understanding for further cooperation. Leaders of the two 
countries stated that Vietnam and Iran have many things in 
common, including advantages and potentials for further 
development of bilateral cooperation. The Iranian president 
said: The first visit to Iran by Vietnamese President Le Duc 
Anh was a good opportunity for the two sides to exchange 
experiences. For his part, 'Ali Hoseyni Ayatollah Khamene'i 
described his satisfaction at what have been achieved, 
considering them initial but firm foundation for long term 
cooperation between Iran and Vietnam. Ayatollah Khamene'i added 
that besides, the two countries should exchange students to 
study languages of both countries. 
  In his talks with Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam, 
Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati said that Iran would prepare 
for the construction of Vietnamese embassy in Tehran. Iranian 
president proposed to organize an exhibition of Iran in Vietnam, 
and vice versa, so that the people of the two countries can have 
better mutual understanding. 
  President Le Duc Anh's visit to Iran resulted in a number of 
agreements signed between the two governments marking a new step 
of development in the relationship and cooperation between 
Vietnam and Iran.

  [Summary] "The coal production output of military units is 
growing larger and larger, from 500,000 tons in 1991 to 570,000 
tons in 1992 and 630,000 tons in 1993. Its expected output for 
1994 is 720,000 tons. Coal exports have also increased rapidly 
with the export volume increasing from 170,000 tons in 1992 to 
200,000 tons in 1993 and to an expected 300,000 tons this year." 
  With its organizational advantage, military units engaged in 
coal production have operated effectively as state enterprises 
under the Army's Truong Son, Song Hong, and 11th Engineering 
General Corporations and have made their adequate contributions 
to the state budget. The first two general corporations have 
become members of the Coal Exporting Council since 1992. 
  "The export through only one outlet has helped eliminate the 
state of competitive buying and selling and the forcible 
reduction of price. This export system is beneficial to both 
the state and the enterprises concerned. However, this system 
has created a situation in which military enterprises have 
concentrated only on production without paying any attention to 
world market demands." 
  As these military enterprises do not have any frequent 
foreign customers, "they have been adversely affected by a 
decision of the COALIMEX (Coal Import-Export and Supply) 
Corporation under the Ministry of Energy to stop helping units 
outside the coal sector export their coal, beginning April 1994." 
  "As of 1 April 1994, coal-exploiting military units had 
registered some 150,000 tons of coal still in backlog, including 
100,000 tons exploited in the first quarter of 1994 and 50,000 
tons left behind since last year. During the first quarter of 
1994, military enterprises could only export 10,000 tons of coal 
or so, including 6,000 tons from the Truong Son Engineering 
General Corporation and over 5,000 tons from the 11th 
Engineering General Corporation. Should the managerial system 
for the production and sales of coal remain unchanged, it is 
certain that coal-producing military units will not achieve 
their marketing targets."

"Continue To Renovate the Thinking on the Task of Defending the 
Fatherland--Issues and Solutions"] 
  [Text] "New Thinking on the Task of Defending the 
Fatherland--Issues and Solutions--Research and Exchange of 
Opinions" is a new regular section opened in TAP CHI QUOC PHONG 
TOAN DAN in 1993. It debuted with an essay of an advisory 
character by the board of editors published in issue No. 1/1993. 
The section has received an enthusiastic response from large 
numbers of leadership, management, and commanding cadres, and 
from theoreticians and scientific researchers of various sectors 
and levels at the center, in localities, and in the people's 
armed forces. By summing up realities in conjunction with 
carrying out theoretical research, the section has expressed 
numerous opinions, has conducted exchanges of experiences, has 
brought up issues, and has suggested solutions. Some of these 
opinions have been accepted and are gradually being introduced 
into life; some have considered on the occasion of the 
preparation for the Midterm Party Conference of Delegates; and 
some others call for further research and exchanges of opinions. 
  The board of editors of TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN 
advocates continuing to expand this section of the journal in 
1994 for the same set purposes[.sup]1[/], on the basis of the 
review of the initial steps of the socialist renovation process 
in general and the renovation of the task of defending the 
fatherland in particular as laid down by the midterm party 
conference of delegates and reflected later in various party 
resolutions and state positions and policies. 
  To contribute to summing up the initial steps of the 
renovation process in the task of consolidating national defense 
and defending the fatherland, this article raises the 
following issues, which are also issues calling for continued 
research, exchanges of opinions, and suggestion of solutions in 
TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN this year. 
  1. Hostile forces' strategic thinking and our new 
concepts of the task of defending the fatherland. 
  Monitoring the schemes and tricks used by imperialism to 
oppose and sabotage socialism in the Soviet Union, Eastern 
Europe, our country in the past, we can see that since the 
beginning of the 80's the strategic thinking of 
imperialism has changed. 
  From resorting to armed violence combined with 
nonviolent tricks such as politics, psychological warfare, 
espionage... as the main way to oppose and sabotage 
us, imperialism has shifted to relying on tricks involving 
nonuse of armed violence such as politics, psychological 
warfare, espionage, economy, culture... as the main 
thrust, combining them with military deterrence and 
limited armed aggression, which may turn into war of aggression 
if an opportunity presents itself and if imperialism believes it 
can achieve victory within a short period of time. Other hostile 
forces have also strongly switched to different maneuvers, 
including the "soft war" trick combined with threat of armed 
violence and "hard war." 
  Pursuing its "peaceful evolution" strategy, imperialism is 
feverishly and openly opposing and sabotaging the Vietnamese 
revolution by means of "free market economy" and "political 
pluralism-democracy-human rights" in various domains: economy, 
politics, theory and ideology, culture, art, way of life.... It 
is prepared to combine subversive rebellion of reactionary 
forces inside the country and military deterrence and armed 
aggression from abroad. An extremely dangerous thing is that 
imperialism is taking advantage of our renovation undertaking 
itself--which also advocates market economy, but one that is 
oriented toward socialism--and our broadening of socialist 
democracy in an attempt to divert our renovation process to 
capitalism. We can predict that, when the United States lifts 
the embargo, the enemy's scheme will be stepped up with new 
tricks--both subtle and glaring--through direct action or under 
the United Nations banner. Thus, danger will develop right in 
the opportunity created by the lifting of the embargo. 
  Along with the hostile forces' activities are the 
destabilizing factors in our internal ranks that we should not 
ignore: Although our country has overcome the most difficult 
periods of the socioeconomic crisis, it still has not yet 
extricated itself from the crisis; although progress has been 
made in the implementation of democracy among the people, many 
limitations still remain; corruption and smuggling activities of 
some people in the state machinery are still serious, causing 
legitimate indignation among the people; contradictions among 
the people and religious and ethnic issues can easily be 
exploited by the enemy to incite public opinion; erroneous 
political tendencies in a number of circles.... 
  All this combines to increase the dangers threatening the 
security of the country and of the socialist regime--dangers 
that lie hidden in many domains of social life. All these 
possibilities and contingencies have been correctly forecast in 
various party resolutions. The obvious question is that we must 
frustrate the "peaceful evolution" strategy and other schemes 
and tricks of the enemy in peacetime. At the same time we must 
be prepared to cope with all limited armed aggressions and even 
with wars of aggression. We do not exaggerate the danger of war 
of aggression, but we should not be subjective and off our guard. 
  From the aforementioned situation and considering the 
characteristics and background of the current national struggle 
and class struggle, we can set forth a number of new 
concepts of national defense as follows: 
  -- The security of the country; the independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the nation; and the 
stability of the socialist regime depend chiefly and primarily 
on political stability, economic growth, and scientific and 
technological development. At the same time, they depend on our 
national defense and security potential, on the deterrent might 
of the people's army and people's armed forces, on the people's 
public security's capability to ensure political security and 
social order and safety, and on the people's vigilance. 
Therefore, to defend the fatherland we must concentrate on the 
task of economic development and national construction; at the 
same time, we must devoted ourselves to consolidating national 
defense and security. Developing the economy in accordance with 
the socialist orientation implies the defense of the regime and 
the fatherland, although national defense still has its own 
requirements and although we still have to combine economic 
development with national defense to make the people prosperous, 
the country powerful, and the society just, healthy, and 
civilized. 
  -- Nowadays to defend the fatherland is to defend the 
socialist regime, a task closely linked with the defense of 
national independence and sovereignty and the state's 
territorial integrity (including the land area, the airspace, 
the sea, the continental shelf, and the exclusive economic 
zone); with the defense of the peaceful labor and the lives and 
property of the people; and with the defense of the national 
characteristics against both foreign aggressors and internal 
enemies. We should criticize the erroneous concept that although 
the socialist regime might collapse we could still have the 
necessary stability and confidence for building an independent, 
free, prosperous, and powerful Vietnamese fatherland. As past 
realities in the Soviet Union showed, if the socialist regime in 
Vietnam collapsed we can predict what Vietnam and its people 
would become in view of the schemes of the hostile and 
reactionary forces at home and abroad aimed at exploiting and 
provoking contradictions in our internal ranks. If that 
happened, could we have peace in order to make the people 
prosperous and the country powerful and to defend national 
sovereignty? 
  -- National defense must be a general strategy in which 
national defense is closely combined with 
security and foreign relations; and even 
national defense, security, and foreign relations themselves 
must be closely combined with economic development and 
national construction in all respects. In this strategy, 
security and foreign relations would become increasingly 
important as attacking spearheads, while the army and national 
defense would serve as deterrent fists. 
  For this reason, we must not make light of the role of the 
people's army and the people's armed forces. Only with 
sufficiently strong national defense potential and a 
sufficiently strong people's army will we be able to deter local 
and foreign hostile forces from engaging in adventurism, to 
ensure a peaceful environment for economic development and 
national construction, to create the basis for guaranteeing 
political security and social order and safety, and to secure 
the necessary position and strength for the conduct of foreign 
relations. This is not to mention the fact the army is also 
duty-bound to participate in ensuring political security, in 
economic building.... 
  Building the all-people national defense, the people's army, 
and the people's armed forces is not an undertaking solely 
designed to prepare us for war; on the contrary, first and best 
of all it must be aimed at rolling back the danger of war, 
contributing to frustrating all enemy schemes in peacetime 
(peaceful evolution, subversive rebellion), consolidating peace, 
and, at the same time, creating greater potential in all domains 
so that we can stand ready to defeat wars of aggression in any 
situation. 
  Generally speaking, that is the modern thinking on the 
task of defending the fatherland, which calls for the 
development of a modern model of national defense and 
the abandonment of the classical thinking on and model of 
national defense based solely on military forces, although in 
the modern thinking on national defense the role of armed 
violence is by no means eliminated; on the contrary, great 
importance must still be attached to this role. Thus, in the 
modern model of national defense not only modern weapons and 
equipment are mentioned, although appropriate modern weapons and 
equipment are still necessary. 
  2. Proceeding from the characteristics of the situation 
in our country, in the region, and in the world, we must 
thoroughly understand the revolutionary tasks, the socialist 
renovative line of the party in the national defense and 
military domains, and must actively build the all-people 
national defense system and the people's armed forces. 
  The initial success of the renovation undertaking in the 
domains of military work, national defense consolidation, and 
armed forces building is primarily a success of the thorough 
understanding of the situation and tasks of the revolution and 
the socialist renovative line of the party. To determine the 
remaining problems in this domain as well as the directions to 
follow in resolving them, we should learn from the 
aforementioned lesson. And that lesson is none other than a 
thorough understanding of the Marxist viewpoint that the 
military must submit to politics and depend on socioeconomic 
conditions. 
  Reality has shown that the situation and tasks of the 
revolution and the socialist renovative line in the economic and 
political domains have a substantial impact on the building of 
the all-people national defense system and the people's armed 
forces. We can cite here some characteristics that have the 
greatest influence: 
  -- The peaceful situation, which is different from war, 
although this peace is not yet steady. 
  -- National construction is the foremost task, a factor 
different from the past, when fighting was the primary task. 
Construction means that we must overcome backwardness and 
poverty, a task many times as difficult as the fight against 
imperialism and feudalism, as Uncle Ho used to say. 
  -- Development of a multisectorial commodity-based economy 
and a socialist market economy and implementation of an 
open-door policy; this is different from the past, when a highly 
centralized, planned, and subsidy-based economy narrowly 
confined in the socialist system was in force. 
  -- Meeting our own needs for weapons, equipment, and supply 
of materials for national defense and war; this is different 
from the past, when we relied on international aid. 
  -- Building of a Vietnamese rule-of-law state of the people, 
by the people, and for the people under the Communist Party 
leadership; this is different from the past, when the party 
assumed many duties of the administration. 
  -- New developments of the modern scientific and 
technological revolution in the world, which marks a new 
qualitative advance of human civilization and profoundly 
influences the economic and military affairs and all domains of 
social life of each nation and throughout the world. 
  From the characteristics of the aforementioned situation and 
tasks, we can see that: 
  We have much experience in war especially experience in war 
of liberation, mainly on the mainland and in the building of 
wartime armed forces. However, we still have little experience 
in consolidating national defense and in building peacetime 
armed forces. Naturally, we still have to pay utmost attention 
to the fact that peace is not yet steady and that there still 
are many unsettling factors. 
  Worse still, we lack experience in building national defense 
and the armed forces on the basis of the socialist market 
economy and in the process of building a Vietnamese rule-of-law 
state under the Communist Party leadership. 
  We are good at conducting all-people war but have little 
experience in building the all-people national defense system 
and in conducting war for national defense on land, in the air, 
and on the sea--our country can be called a "marine state" 
because its sea area is three times as large as its land area. 
Therefore, we are still unable to satisfactorily combine 
national defense with economic building and various aspects of 
national construction in which we should pay much attention to 
combining national defense activities with economic building on 
the sea. National defense building remains narrowly confined in 
many respects and is considered an exclusive duty of the 
Ministry of National Defense, the people's army, and the 
people's armed forces; this task has not yet been open to all 
society and has not yet really become an undertaking of all the 
people and all branches of the state from the central to the 
local level, especially the central level. We have not yet 
promptly made the most of the many achievements in the national 
renovation undertaking.... 
  Some positions and policies of our party and state on 
national defense and army building have not yet been in harmony 
with the market economy and peacetime construction; the supply 
of materials and budget for this task has not yet been 
rationally ensured as permitted by the situation of the country. 
  There still are hitches in the relationship between the 
party 
leadership and the state management. Party resolutions have not 
yet been institutionalized; many resolutions have not been 
implemented. To a certain degree the state still operates on its 
own initiative, on the basis of personal relations, and 
according to negotiated agreements. 
  The problem here is that we must learn from and improve on 
past, diversified experiences and creatively apply them to the 
new conditions, situations, and tasks. We must overcome 
conservatism and empiricism while opposing dogmatism and the 
state of being divorced from reality in the past there had been 
some dogmatism and empiricism in emulating the socialist 
countries; now there may be dogmatism and empiricism in 
emulating the capitalist countries. 
  We must overcome the remaining shortcomings and weaknesses 
and see to it that our entire political system, including the 
party, the state, and the mass organizations, really participate 
in further consolidating national defense and building the 
people's armed forces. This means that we must thoroughly 
understand the all-people national defense viewpoint in the 
conditions of the socialist renovation undertaking, and 
must pay greater attention to closely combining national 
construction with national defense. 
  We must strengthen the party's centralized and unified 
leadership over the two strategic tasks of building and 
defending the fatherland, and over national defense and security 
work and foreign relations. We must institutionalize the party's 
decisions on national defense and security and on people's armed 
forces building; and must strengthen the state management of 
national defense work. All party and administrative 
organizations at the center and in localities, party groups, and 
party affairs committees of the various ministries, departments, 
services, and mass organizations at the center... must attach 
special importance to leading and managing the national defense 
task according to their functions and duties and must closely 
combine the two strategic tasks. 
  The Conference on All-People National Defense Work held in 
November 1993 brought up and resolved numerous important issues 
such as opposing "peaceful evolution," educating party and state 
cadres and the people in national defense; building defense 
zones; building mobilization-ready reserve forces and preparing 
them for wartime mobilization; and building militia and 
self-defense forces. Obviously, these tasks can be accomplished 
only if there is an aggregate strength of the entire people 
under the party leadership and state management combined with 
broad mass movements. 
  There is a major issue of national defense relating to the 
entire national construction task and bearing mostly on various 
ministries, departments, and services at the central level--an 
issue that needs to be settled--namely the question of 
combining national defense with economic development and 
other aspects of national construction and with investment in 
the building of national defense industry in order to 
strengthen economic potential and achieve political stability 
while strengthening national defense potential. Only on 
this basis will we be able to draw up accurate wartime 
mobilization plans, to maintain high combat readiness, and, when 
required by the situation, to turn the potential of the country 
and of the all-people national defense system into the strength 
of people's war for national defense. 
  We all know that combining national construction with 
national defense is an element of the model of socialism in 
Vietnam, as reflected in the six characteristics and seven basic 
directions stated in the seventh party congress Political 
Program. Settlement of this relationship will have an impact on 
the entire national development process in general and on each 
aspect of economic building, national construction, and national 
defense in particular. This impact is evident and direct in 
areas such as the building of infrastructure, communications and 
transportation, roads, airfields, piers, post and 
telecommunications; in major, long-term economic plans and 
projects; in economic projects relating to foreign investment. 
As stated above, this problem has become more complicated in 
the conditions of the multisectorial economy operating in 
accordance with the market mechanism; this is different from the 
past, when there were only two economic sectors--the state and 
collective sectors--in the highly centralized planned economy. 
  To satisfactorily carry out the tasks of economic building, 
national construction, and national defense, and to skillfully 
combine the two strategic tasks, party and state cadres and the 
mass organizations must have knowledge of military and national 
defense affairs and military cadres must have knowledge of 
economic and legal matters and other fields. 
  We must institutionalize party decisions and strengthen 
the state management of national defense and armed forces 
building. 
  -- We must determine in the Constitution and the law the 
national defense duty of all citizens, various economic sectors, 
production and business organizations, sociopolitical 
organizations, various ministries, departments, and services of 
the state at the center and in localities. 
  -- We must have a national development strategy encompassing 
the economy, national defense, and other areas of construction, 
and combining the two strategic tasks, which include the 
national defense strategy or the national defense and security 
strategy. 
-- We must adopt major policies to ensure implementation of 
the national defense and armed forces building tasks. 
-- We must have an adequate budget; this budget must be 
reflected in the Law on State Budget and concretely 
determined in government plans and programs of action for each 
period of time (five-year and annual plans and programs). The 
national defense budget is not limited to the budget of the 
Ministry of National Defense but also includes the military 
budget contained in the general budget of various sectors at the 
center and in the budgets of various localities. 
  -- The Ministry of National Defense must fulfill its 
functions as the principal state management organ in charge of 
national defense and as a capable staff of the party and other 
state services in national defense matters. The ministry must 
inspect the implementation of national defense tasks by various 
state services, localities, production and business units, 
economic sectors, social organizations, and citizens. 
-- The ministries, departments, and services at the center 
must have components (or specialists) in charge of monitoring 
national defense work in order to, first of all, satisfactorily 
fulfill their functions and duties in relation to the national 
defense task and, at the same time, to satisfactorily carry out 
the national defense task pertaining to their functions and 
duties. 
  -- We must develop the mechanism of party leadership and 
state management in the field of national defense and armed 
forces building. 
  Concerning the building of the people's army and the 
masses' armed forces in particular, we must do the 
following: 
  As a result of our strategic adjustments, our military 
organization has now been radically turned into a 
peacetime military organization with its three 
categories of troops reshaped in accordance with peacetime 
conditions and with the market economy (they are different from 
the organization of the three categories of troops during 
wartime and in the highly centralized planned economy). 
  The problem here is to enhance the quality of the 
people's army and of all the three categories of troops so that 
they can meet the demands of peacetime political and military 
tasks, have sufficient strength to deter hostile forces, and 
join the entire people in achieving victory in case of 
hostilities. 
  To step up the building of the revolutionary, regular, 
well-trained, and gradually modernized people's army, we must 
basically renovate our thinking on building the people's army in 
peacetime and in the market economy, on the basis of applying 
and developing the principled experiences in building the 
revolutionary army and people's army over the past few decades. 
We must continue to carry out research on and determine the 
total troop strength and the rational relationship between the 
standing army and the reserves. We must renovate the 
organization of the forces of the three categories of troops, 
the armed branches and services, the rapid-reaction mobile 
force, the stationary force, and the militia and self-defense 
forces in the multisectorial economy. We must do research on 
combining the military draft system with the volunteer system 
and broaden the career soldier system. We must basically 
renovate the army building and army welfare policies and should 
not confuse the national defense policy with the social welfare 
policy. We must restore the image of Uncle Ho's soldiers and 
enhance the standing of the people's army and the officers corps 
on the social scale of value. We must satisfactorily meet the 
legitimate and reasonable material and spiritual needs of 
soldiers, officers, and their families when they are on active 
duty as well as after they have returned to civilian life. We 
must develop the people's army politically and build pure and 
strong basic party organizations in the army. We must provide 
the officers corps with college education in keeping with 
President Ho Chi Minh's concept of turning workers and peasants 
into intellectuals, and must develop a new model and set new 
targets for officer training according to the three levels of 
army officers. We must rearrange the military school system in 
the common training system of the state. We must adopt a policy 
aimed at attracting talents to serve in the army. We must 
acquire some new weapons and equipment in conjunction with using 
and maintaining the weapons and technical equipment currently 
available. We must improve the quality of military education and 
training, step up the building of the regular army and 
comprehensively strong units by stepping up research on military 
science and technology, on other social sciences, and on the 
humanities, and by combining practical review with theoretical 
research. We must improve the economic efficiency of the units 
engaged in production and economic building. We must enhance the 
combat readiness of various units, care for the material and 
spiritual life of cadres and soldiers, and build the army into a 
wholesome school of culture appealing to the youth. We must make 
army building a task really of the entire party and people and 
of all the political system so that it can fully benefit from 
the achievements in the renovation undertaking in terms of 
people, spirit, intellect, ethics, and material and technical 
base, with attention paid to the scientific and technological 
achievements in the gray area between people's livelihood and 
national defense. 
  Cadres and soldiers of the people's army themselves must 
actively strive to fulfill all tasks entrusted by the party, the 
state, and the people in the national renovation undertaking to 
defend--and contribute to the building of--the socialist 
Vietnamese fatherland. In this way they will be making practical 
preparations for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the heroic 
Vietnam People's Army (December 1944-December 1994).

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Over a hundred protesters 
gathered outside the Japanese Embassy Friday to demand the 
immediate dismissal of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano. 
  "Apologize, Repent," chanted demonstrators belonging to the 
Association of Pacific War Victims and Families. 
  A letter from the group delivered to the embassy said 
Nagano's comments revealed the Japanese Government's two-faced 
view of history and constituted a threat to peace in Asia. 
  The just-appointed justice minister with a long career in 
the 
military enraged Japan's Asian neighbors when he said his 
country was not the aggressor in World War II but a party 
dedicated to freeing Asia from European colonialism. 
  He also said he didn't believe the massacre of Chinese by 
Japanese soldiers in "the rape of Nanjing" was true. 
  The comments instantly touched a nerve in South Korea, which 
still chafes at more than three decades of Japanese colonial 
rule before liberation came at the end of the Second World War. 
  "Retract Nagano's comments and immediately fire him," the 
association said in a statement, adding that Japan should 
suspend its attempts at remilitarization through constitutional 
revision and clear up all questions about its past by 1995. 
  "If these terms are not fulfilled, we will start with our 
neighbors in Southeast Asia who suffered from the Pacific War a 
campaign against buying Japanese products," the statement said. 
  The dissident-led National Alliance for Democracy and 
Unification in Korea issued a similar statement, demanding legal 
and systematic compensation for victims of the war. 
  "Nagano's words reflect the Japanese Government's political 
intention to abort its admission of war crimes and legal, 
systematic compensation measures," the alliance said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu urged Japan Friday to clarify itself on 
its justice minister's remarks and take "appropriate" action. 
  In a hastily arranged meeting with Japanese Ambassador to 
Seoul Goto Toshio, Han said it's nothing short of "throwing cold 
water on efforts by both countries to improve South Korea-Japan 
relations for an incumbent cabinet minister to make such remarks 
while the Japanese Government is championing political reform 
and contribution to the international community. 
  Just-named Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano said 
during an interview this week that his country was not an 
aggressor in the World War II but a liberator of Asian colonies 
from European imperialism. 
  He said the mass killing in the rape of Nanjing was "a 
hoax." 
  "Nagano's remarks greatly shocked the South Korean 
Government 
and the people," Han told the ambassador, "such distorted 
historical perspective is very regrettable." 
  Demanding action on the incident, the foreign minister 
emphasized that Tokyo "would have to take appropriate measures" 
for the comments. 
  Goto said he understands Han's reaction as concern shown by 
the South Korean Government and will report to his home 
government. 
  "But I believe the comments should not end up throwing cold 
water on improving bilateral relations," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Ruling and opposition 
lawmakers alike bashed Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano 
Friday and demanded an unequivocal diplomatic apology. 
  Nagano has justified Japan's aggression during World War II 
by claiming his country wanted to liberate Asian colonies from 
Europe. 
  He also dismissed the "Rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese 
soldiers are believed to have killed some 300,000 Chinese 
civilians, as "a hoax." 
  His comments immediately raised temperatures in South Korea, 
a victim of over three decades of Japanese colonial rule before 
liberation at the end of World War II. 
  Seoul and Tokyo had reached a political understanding last 
summer to close the book on their unhappy history. 
  In addition to their own ire at Nagano's remarks, lawmakers 
here are concerned that his comments were not a slip of the 
tongue but representative of the new faction advocating Japan's 
remilitarization. 
  After all, they cite Nagano's high status as justice 
minister 
and the fact that he is the first cabinet member since the war 
who was a member of the Japanese self-defense forces. 
  Ruling Democratic Liberal Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong called 
Nagano's words "bombastic, against the world current." 
  "We cannot but express serious regrets that a cabinet member 
of the Japanese Government that champions political reform has 
such a skewed perspective of history," he said in a party 
commentary. 
  "There has to be a clear explanation from the person 
himself, 
naturally, and from the Japanese Government." 
  Rep. Kwon Ik-hyon, former chairman and now adviser to the 
Korea- Japan Parliamentarian Union, said he cannot understand 
"such betrayal of common sense." 
  "I hope it was nothing more than a spur-of-the-moment 
thing," 
he said. 
  Rep. No Chae-pong, a member of the National Assembly Foreign 
Affairs-Unification Committee, wondered why Nagano made such 
comments when Seoul and Tokyo were finally working on building a 
future relationship. 
  Deputy Spokesman Son Hak-kyu was worried about a revival of 
Japanese militarism. "But South Korea-Japan relations should not 
be influenced by this incident, and we send our full support to 
the majority of the Japanese people who want peace through 
resolution of the past," he said. 
  Opposition Democratic Party spokesman Pak Chi-won wanted to 
know if the Japanese Government has indeed changed its 
perspective on the war. 
  "Our government must demand a clear-cut explanation and 
prevent any repetition of this kind of incident," he said in a 
commentary. 
  Rep. Kim Won-ki, saying it was not an accidental outburst, 
insisted Nagano's comments reflect what Japan has believed all 
along. 
  "The whole world is turning into regional blocs. Japan, too, 
hasn't given up its hopes for hegemony," he said. "Nagano's talk 
could turn into a real threat for us if we don't build up our 
political role." 
  "It's nothing short of historical distortion proving the war 
of colonialism has not yet ended," Rep. Yim Chae-Chong said. 
  Rep. Son Se-il blasted the new Japanese Government, accusing 
it of being more backward than the Liberal Democratic Party on 
historical issues. 
  "Our government is even considering military cooperation 
with 
Japan, but we have to review South Korea-Japan relations from 
the basics," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
said on Friday Japan should take a proper action in connection 
with Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's recent remarks on Japan's 
role during World War II regardless of his retraction of the 
remarks Friday. 
  Nagano was reported to have apologized over and retracted 
his 
controversial remarks, saying, "My recent remarks about the past 
history were not appropriate ... I am retracting the statement 
in its entirety." 
  The Japanese minister earlier said Japan fought during World 
War II to "liberate Asian colonies from Europe" and the massacre 
said to have been committed by the Japanese Army in Nanjing, 
China was a "hoax." 
  A Seoul Government official said in a comment that "we can 
hardly regard Nagano's retraction as having completely rectified 
the distorted view of past history on the part of an incumbent 
Japanese cabinet member." 
  "We expect the Japanese Government to make an official 
clarification and take a proper action as Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu asked Tokyo earlier in the day," the official said. 
  Press reports from Tokyo indicated that in a press 
conference 
in Tokyo Nagano regretted it that his remarks set off public 
uproars in South Korea, China and some other relevant countries. 
  Stating he was feeling responsible for his remarks, Nagano 
said that he would leave the issue of whether he would resign as 
justice minister to the judgement of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.

<F P=106> [By O Chun-tong] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano's controversial remarks on the Pacific war are 
expected to stir up a political debate in the Diet (parliament). 
  Social Democratic Party Secretary-General Wataru Kubo said 
in 
an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday evening that 
the justice minister's remarks would prompt the Diet to call 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to account and question Nagano's 
fitness to serve in the cabinet, suggesting that his party would 
make an issue of the comments when the House of Representatives 
(the lower house of the Diet) opens. 
  Nagano has said the war was intended to liberate the 
colonies 
and create a greater East Asian co-prosperity sphere. He also 
called the Nanjing massacre of Chinese civilians and prisoners 
of war a hoax. 
  "We have to attach importance to his having said that it is 
wrong to call the Pacific war a war of aggression," Kubo said. 
  Pointing to former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
remarks 
that the Pacific war was wrong and Japan was the aggressor, he 
noted that Nagano's comments indicate the new cabinet's policy 
has changed from that of its predecessor. 
  All Japanese television networks, including NHK, reported 
that the justice minister's remarks were causing ripples in 
South Korea, China, Russia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia on 
their news programs Thursday. 
  In particular, NHK reported that Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin had expressed regret over Nagano's comments in a 
roundabout way on Thursday when he met Bunpei Hara, speaker of 
the Diet's Upper House. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and the ruling coalition, 
concerned about the unexpectedly strong reactions from Korea, 
China and other countries, will take action to clear up the 
fallout from the controversial remarks to preserve friendly 
relations with these nations. 
  The steps will include having Nagano accept political 
reponsibility for the remarks and issuing a statement that they 
were his personal opinion and not related to the Hata cabinet's 
policy in any way. 
  A government source said Friday the steps would be taken as 
soon as Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
return from tours of Europe and the Middle East, noting the 
ruling minority coalition is in a difficult position as the 
majority opposition, including the Social Democratic Party, is 
moving to make a political issue of the remarks. 
  The Hata government is worried that Nagano's remarks will 
harm relations with South Korea, China and other countries as 
they brought up memories of past suffering, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Communications 
Minister Yun Tong-yun and his Japanese counterpart Hikasa 
Katsuyuki agreed Friday to establish a policy coordination 
committee to help construct an "Information Superhighway" 
linking the two countries, the Communications Ministry said. 
  The two ministers also agreed to hold seminars on building 
an 
information superhighway and to exchange ministry officials to 
boost bilateral cooperation on the project. 
  The agreements were reached during a meeting of the two 
ministers, the first of its kind, which South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam and former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa had pledged to hold during a summit meeting last March. 
  In a joint statement after the meeting, the two ministers 
stressed that the information and communications industry will 
supply the core technology which will decide national 
competitiveness in the 21st century and that building 
information infrastructure through cooperation between Seoul and 
Tokyo will contribute to the development of the world economy, 
culture and living standards. 
  The ministers also said they had agreed to discuss further 
the possibility of allowing businesses from one country to 
participate in information infrastructure projects in the other, 
the development of communications satellites and the use of 
frequency resources. 
  According to officials of the Communications Ministry who 
attended the meeting, the Korean side outlined Seoul's 
information superhighway projects including organizing and 
financing plans. 
  The Japanese also explained plans to organize and finance 
such projects, the officials said. They introduced a model 
project in which the information superhighway network will be 
installed in the western Kansai region ahead of other regions. 
  During the meeting, the Japanese proposed the establishment 
of the Asia Information Infrastructure (AII) to compete with the 
Global Information Infrastructure (GII) planned by the United 
States, the officials said. The Seoul side opposed the idea, 
however, citing the need to move gradually because the GII 
project remains in the planning stage and the AII project 
requires cooperation from China and Southeast Asian countries. 
  The proposed policy coordination committee on the 
information 
superhighway consists of bureau-director-level officials from 
the two ministries who will co-chair committee meetings, 
officials from Korea Telecom, Korea Electronics and 
Telecommunications Research Institute, Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone, several other communications technology institutes 
and academics from both countries, according to the ministry 
officials. 
  Katsuyuki, who arrived here Thursday at the invitation of 
South Korean Communications Minister Yun, is scheduled to fly 
back to Tokyo Saturday afternoon after winding up his three-day 
visit, the officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Forty-four deals between 
South and North Korea worth 16 million U.S. dollars were 
approved by the National Unification Board in April [NUB], NUB 
said in a report Friday. 
  Comparable figures in the previous month were 72 deals worth 
21. 55 million dollars. 
  Of all approvals, 37 were for buying North Korean products 
worth 13.73 million dollars, 30 percent off from the 19.75 
million dollars (59 cases) in March. 
  The remaining seven were for shipment of Southern products 
worth 2.31 million dollars, up 29 percent from the previous 
month. The sharp gain was attributed to an increase in the 
shipment of raw materials under processing-on-commission 
contracts.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is shifting 
its military policy from defense against a possible attack by 
North Korea to diverse efforts to enhance cooperation with such 
neighbors as China, Japan and Russia and participation in United 
Nations Peacekeeping Operations, the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army (PLA) daily reported Wednesday. 
  The shift was prompted by changing international politics 
and 
the volatile military situation surrounding the Korean 
peninsula, said the PLA organ. It predicted that Seoul would 
achieve military self-reliance by focusing on developing 
state-of-the-art weapons, specializing and systematizing its 
defense industry and training elite troops. 
  Such efforts will be pursued in line with Seoul's policy of 
"all-direction" military and diplomatic cooperation, said the 
PLA daily. 
  It added that despite this policy shift, military 
cooperation 
between Seoul and Washington will remain the core of South 
Korea's defense relations with other countries. 
  The policy shift, drawn up by the South Korean Defense 
Ministry, has already been reported to President Kim Yong-sam 
and will likely be approved by President Kim in the near future, 
said the PLA organ.

  [Text] Pusan, South Korea, May 6 (YONHAP) -- China has 
officially demanded that a South Korean ship pay a 50,000-dollar 
fine for violating Chinese territorial waters, Foreign Ministry 
officials here said Friday. 
  The Jiangxi Provincial people's government officially 
notified the South Korean Embassy in China that it is detaining 
a Korean ship, "the 2d Songgwang-ho," and that it has decided to 
fine the vessel 50,000 U.S. dollars for allegedly fishing in 
Chinese waters. 
  Of the 50,000 dollars, the fine for illegal fishing is 
30,000 
dollars and that for violating China's territorial waters is 
20,000 dollars. 
  The fine is about 20 times higher than that levied by South 
Korea on ships violating its territorial waters and so runs 
counter to the principle of equity, according to ministry 
officials. 
  Besides, Sin Hyong-pok, captain of the Songgwang-ho, and the 
other 10 crew members claim they did not violate Chinese waters 
on purpose but lost control of the ship due to engine trouble. 
  Ministry officials, worried that the problem might develop 
into a diplomatic tiff, said, "we will make efforts to persuade 
China to lower the fine as well as return the crew as soon as 
possible." 
  Chinese patrol ships captured the "Songgwang-ho" in the East 
China Sea 175 miles southwest of Cheju Island's Mosulpo port 
last Friday at 11 AM after seizing another fishing vessel, "the 
Taehung- ho," and its 11 crew. 
  Both vessels were adrift after experiencing engine trouble, 
according to the crew. 
  Meanwhile, China has not sent an official notification on 
the 
capture of the Taehung-ho, the Foreign Ministry said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Foreign investment in Korea 
totaled 192 cases worth 519 million U.S. dollars in 
January-April, increasing 39.1 percent and 35.9 percent, 
respectively, from 138 cases worth 382 million dollars in the 
same period last year, the Finance Ministry said Friday. 
  This year's active foreign investment can be attributed to 
increased facility investment following the country's economic 
recovery and easing of various rules and other moves to attract 
foreign investment, the ministry officials said. 
  As a result, new foreign investment surged 61 percent in 
case 
and 224.5 percent in value. 
  In manufacturing, investment stopped at 78 cases worth 157 
million dollars during the first four months, up 30 percent from 
a year earlier but off 41.2 percent in value. 
  Investment in non-manufacturing industries, in contrast, 
rose 
46.2 percent to 114 cases and 214.8 percent to 362 million 
dollars. 
  Investment from the United States and Japan decreased 13.5 
percent and 20.6 percent, respectively, in value, while 
investment from the European union soared 178.7 percent. 
Investment from Europe centered on the high-tech auto parts 
industry.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The continued strength of 
the Japanese yen is helping boost exports by the Korean heavy 
and chemical industries, sources said Friday. 
  In the semiconductor area, Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar 
Electronics Co. and Hyundai Electronics Co. are engaged in full 
operation to meet rising demand for the third quarter. 
  As for home electronic appliances, the companies are moving 
to meet strong demand from Southeast Asia and are busy 
increasing their competitiveness against Japanese goods. 
  A Goldstar official said, "in the first quarter exports rose 
25 percent from the same period last year and sales in 
Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand jumped more than 100 
percent. Exports are their most active since 1988." 
  Production of such electronic parts as cathode-ray tubes and 
refrigerator compressors is insufficient to satisfy surging 
demand from abroad and Goldstar has expanded its video cassette 
recorder production lines. 
  Korean automakers plan to raise prices in the United States, 
Europe and Latin America because their Japanese rivals will 
inevitably have to hike prices due to the yen's strength. 
  The shipbuilding industry recovered vigor in April and the 
petrochemical industry is in contact with Southeast Asian buyers 
who are snubbing Japanese products due to rising prices. 
  But the machinery industry here must import some important 
parts from Japan, causing it to suffer from the strong yen, the 
Korea Association of Machinery Industry said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Overseas orders placed with 
South Korean construction companies are on the increase, the 
Construction Ministry said Friday. 
  Orders from abroad reached 1,520,989,000 U.S. dollars in the 
first four months of this year, up 70 percent from the same 
period last year, according to the ministry. 
  Orders from East and West Asia stood at 951 million dollars, 
followed by deals with the Middle East at 369 million dollars 
and with other regions at 201 million dollars. 
  Bangladesh topped the list with orders worth 311 million 
dollars, trailed by Saudi Arabia with 292 million dollars and 
Singapore with 256 million dollars. 
  Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. received 453 
million dollars worth of orders from overseas, followed by 
Ssangyong Construction Co., Ltd. with 232 million dollars and 
Hanjin Construction Corp. with 160 million dollars. 
  Hyundai landed a 250-million-dollar order to build a bridge 
over the Jamuna River in Bangladesh and a 113-million-dollar 
deal to construct Eastern General Hospital in Singapore. 
  Ssangyong received a 136-million-dollar order for Kandang 
Kerbau National Hospital in Singapore, while Sunkyong 
Engineering and Construction Co. won a deal worth 145 million 
dollars to build Maptaphut Aromatics and Reformer Plant in 
Thailand. 
  The Construction Ministry said South Korean builders may 
receive 6 billion dollars worth of overseas orders this year. 
  Explaining the increase in overseas construction, the 
ministry cited continued revitalization of economies in 
Southeast Asia, the U.S. lifting of economic sanctions against 
Vietnam, progress in the Middle East peace talks and 
acceleration of China's opening policy.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and 
Inspection (BAI) will conduct special examinations of government 
officials who have adopted an easy-going, don't-rock-the-boat 
attitude, it was reported Friday. 
  A senior BAI official said the lackadaisical posture of many 
public servants has reached a critical point, reflected in a 
recent turbulence at farm and fishery wholesale markets created 
by implementation of a revised act on the distribution of farm 
and fishery products. 
  Declaring that some government officials' easy-going 
attitude 
is blocking the administration's reform efforts, the official 
said the BAI has decided to take a closer look at officialdom. 
  Critics as well as ordinary citizens are blaming the recent 
fiasco at farm and fishery wholesale markets on official 
incompetence, negligence and indifference. 
  The markets were nearly paralyzed earlier this week when 
wholesalers, protesting against the new act, refused to take 
part in auctions, causing prices of farm and fishery products to 
skyrocket at the retail level. 
  The new act, which went into effect last Sunday, bans 
middlemen in the distribution of farm and fishery products in 
order to protect producers and consumers. 
  But in enforcing the new law, the Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Ministry failed to anticipate the kind of disruption 
it would cause at the wholesale level and to provide an 
effective alternative to the existing system. The Ministry 
announced Wednesday it would put off implementation of the new 
act for six months. 
  The BAI has already conducted a series of unannounced 
inspections of governmental agencies, covering a two-week period 
last month, in which it unearthed instances of officials 
neglecting their duties, the official said. 
  The BAI plans to undertake additional examinations, he said. 
  Specifically, in the first phase the BAI wants to find out 
whether some officials are needlessly sitting on proposals or 
documents or have rejected papers on unjustifiable grounds, the 
official said. 
  In the second stage, the BAI plans to expand the inspections 
to cover officials suspected of neglecting their duties or not 
handling their jobs actively, the official said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The betting is on as to 
whether the government will lift financial sanctions on the 
Hyundai Business Group as four banks and financial institutes 
have offered to lend 110 billion won to Hyundai Petrochemical Co. 
  If it is approved, the joint loan from Boram, Korea 
Long-term 
Credit, Kwangju Bank, and KKBC International will be the largest 
form of financial assistance to a Hyundai affiliate since the 
inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam government. 
  Financial sources say that except for the main trading banks 
-- Korea Exchange and Korea Development -- Hyundai had 
experienced no trouble in trading with commercial banks. 
  Nevertheless, Hyundai is reportedly attaching great meaning 
to the 110-billion-won loan, considering it a cue on whether the 
government still has hard feelings against the business giant, 
which allegedly helped fund the presidential campaign for its 
founder Chong Chu-yong in the 1992 election. 
  If the loan goes through, the group is poised to initiate 
various investments it has so far shelved or scaled down. 
  Hyundai had initially planned to spend 4.5 trillion won this 
year, 3.3 trillion won on facilities and 1.2 trillion won on 
research and development. 
  It had hoped to receive assistance worth 1.54 trillion won 
from the Korea Development Bank for spending on seven affiliates 
including Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Precision and Industry. 
  But when its application for facility funding at the state- 
financed bank was not even registered, Hyundai had to put off 
some projects or scale down investment. 
  Hyundai officials say they anticipate smooth funding by 
banks 
now that Chong has announced his plans to retire from active 
business management. 
  The group had planned to invest 1.1 trillion won in its 
biggest company, Hyundai Motor, to expand production lines. But 
construction of the factory with an output capacity of 100,000 
trucks and buses has been put on hold because of slow financial 
assistance. 
  Hyundai Electronics hopes to finish constructing assembly 
lines for 16 megabyte dynamic random access memory chips by the 
latter part of the year after a long delay. 
  Company officials say they could have fully enjoyed the 
semiconductor boom like other firms in the industry had the 
plant been built on schedule. 
  The group is apparently getting restless just thinking about 
how rival companies are forging ahead due to its delayed 
investments. 
  "Frankly, we would like to register the shares of our 
affiliates on the over-the-counter market and apply for a loan 
at the Korea Development Bank right now," one official says. 
  But Hyundai is refraining from any hasty action lest it 
irritate the government. 
  "For the time being, we will just wait and see," he says.

distribution and price stabilization and thereby allowed a room 
for the recent farm goods market disturbance despite the lapse 
of more than a year since the legislation of the law," Kim said. 
  The instructions were given at a meeting of senior 
presidential secretaries at Chongwadae. 
  Chongwadae Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said the president stated 
it 
was not right for the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Ministry to try to make up shortcomings of a law with an 
implementation decree. 
  "If you had found shortcomings in a new law, the 
administration should have taken a lawful measure to rectify it 
in consulation, if necessary, with the ruling party," President 
Kim was quoted as saying. 
  Earlier in the week, farm goods market brokers staged a 
two-day strike to paralyze major agricultural markets in protest 
against the new law which they claimed would undermine their 
interests.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has agreed to meet US 
President Bill Clinton at the White House on May 6, Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Wednesday. 
  The meeting, the first at official level between the two 
leaders will take place at 2.45 p.m. (2.45 a.m. May 7 Malaysian 
Time), he told reporters here. 
  The prime minister will be accompanied by the Malaysian 
Ambassador in Washington D.C. Abdul Majid Mohamed to the 
bilateral talks, Abdullah said, adding that Dr. Mahathir will be 
in the US from May 5 on a private visit. 
  I see this meeting as very important for US-Malaysia 
relations, and also due to the fact that the US is our third 
largest trading partner and the biggest investor in Malaysia, he 
said. 
  The embassy in Washington was making the necessary 
arrangements for the meeting, reported to be at the invitation 
of President Clinton. 
  However, the agenda for the meeting was not available. 
Abdullah said he had yet to be informed on the details [words 
indistinct] expected international issues like the conflict in 
Bosnia and economic matters would be discussed during the 
meeting. Malaysia has been playing an active role on the Bosnian 
issue. 
  The White House invitation to Dr. Mahathir was disclosed by 
its assistant secretary of state for Far East and the Pacific 
Affairs Winston Lord during a Worldnet Dialogue, a satellite 
news conference, organised in conjunction with the US-ASEAN 
dialogue scheduled for two days from May 9. 
  Lord said that Washington was keeping an open mind on the 
Malaysia-initiated East Asia Economic Caucus, EAEC, so long as 
the concept did not sideline the US. 
  He said Clinton sent an invitation letter to Dr. Mahathir 
for 
the meeting at the White House.

  [Text] Malaysia welcomes the recent historic PLO-Israeli 
peace accord signed between PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo. Foreign Minister Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the accord was heading in the right 
direction for the creation of the State of Palestine. He said 
Malaysia had pledged to assist 'Arafat's Palestine Liberation 
Organization to recapture the lands from the Israelis. Malaysia 
also congratulated President Mubarak for his special role in 
bringing about the peaceful settlement in Gaza and Jericho. 
Under the agreement, Israel will pull out most of its troops 
from Gaza and Jericho [words indistinct]. It is the first 
withdrawal from the occupied lands it captured in 1967. The 
current agreement is the second of the protracted peace 
agreements between the PLO and Israel, both having signed the 
treaty on the self-rule.

    [Editorial Report] The Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA in 
Malay on 6 April, page 7, reported that four Swedish defense 
companies (Celsius Tech, Bofors, Ericsson Radar Systems, and 
Kockums) are vying for the contract to build six patrol boats 
for the Royal Malaysian Navy. Although the Malaysian navy is in 
need of 27 patrol boats at an approximate total cost of $1.6 
billion, only six are budgeted in the Seventh Malaysia Plan 
(1996-2000). 
  Celsius Tech, trying to improve its chances of winning the 
bid for its new 9LV Mk 3 command and surveillance radar systems, 
has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Malaysia's 
Sapura Holdings for the assembly and maintenance of the systems. 
Bofors, known for its missiles, guns, and ammunition, is 
offering to manufacture components and ammunition for the 40-mm 
and 57-mm anti-aircraft guns with a local partner. Ericsson 
Radar Systems has offered its Sea Giraffe 150 surveillance 
radars, while Kockums, a leading warship construction company, 
has signed an MOU with Malaysia's Hicom Corp. for designing and 
building the boats.

  [Text] MALAYSIAN International Trade and Industry Minister 
Rafidah Aziz turned down a proposal from Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak who suggested ASEAN countries review the 
tariff cut schedule under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (Afta). 
  A source from their meeting said that Suphachai asked the 
ASEAN ministers to compare the tariffs on petrochemical products 
sector by sector but the ASEAN ministers said that the tariff 
cut schedule should remain unchanged. Thailand has proposed to 
cut tariffs on petrochemical products according to the normal 
track timeframe -- that is, tariffs should be cut to 20 per cent 
over five years from 1996. 
  Malaysia and Indonesia, however wanted to opt out of cutting 
tariffs on petrochemicals. Officials said that their rates are 
still lower or close to the levels implemented by Thailand. 
  Meanwhile, plastic industry representatives will meet with 
Dr 
Sippanon Ketthat, chairman of the Petroleum Authority of 
Thailand, on April 29 to ask for a tax reduction on raw 
petroleum in order to protect the plastic and related industries 
which are to be affected by Afta. 
  The source said that the plastics industry would like to 
discuss the effects of protecting the petrochemical industry, 
and cooperation between the petrochemical and plastic industries 
on problems which will arise from the government tax 
restructuring in line with Afta. 
  The plastics industry is ready to comply with the government 
tax restructuring but on the condition that the tax on raw 
materials be reduced more than the tax on plastic products. 
  If not, small industries consuming plastic pellets would 
suffer. And in the long term, the petrochemical industry would 
be hurt since nobody can afford a higher price for plastic 
pellets in the domestic market, the source said. Also, there is 
a possibility of cheaper pellets from aboard coming into 
Thailand, even if the government sets high import duties, the 
source said. 
  Although the government will succeed in setting up an Afta 
Adjustment Fund designed to help industries immediately affected 
by Afta, small plastics companies will not benefit from it, only 
large firms, the source said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Malaysian International Trade and Industry </F>
Minister Rafidah Aziz by Yang Razali Kassim in Kuala Lumpur; 
date not given] 
  [Text] BUSINESS TIMES: What is the origin of the 
informal retreat [of ASEAN economic ministers in Awana, 
Malaysia]? 
  Mrs. Rafidah: When we have our structured meeting every 
year, the agenda is already set. We don't have enough time to 
discuss in- depth the long-term vision for Asean. So when we 
met last year in Singapore, we agreed that we should have one 
informal meeting, minus the rigmarole of formality, even without 
officers. 
  Because Asean economic ministers have achieved a very high 
degree of personalised relationships, I am very happy to note 
the frankness and forthrightness of our discussions. 
  Q: And what are the instances of this frankness? 
  A: For example, why some countries are not able to offer 
some products for tariff cuts. Explanations were given as to 
why some countries took action to raise tariffs for some 
products, like Malaysia did. We gave our reasons, so there 
would be greater understanding. And there were many things that 
we agreed to do to solve some of the irritations among Asean 
members in the area of trade. 
  Most importantly, this sort of meeting provides the 
ministers 
with the possibility to filter down to officers certain policy 
decisions for the future. In the past, it was down-up. 
Officers make a suggestion and the ministers take it up. In 
this case, the ministers look at it, decide what is best for 
Asean, and ask the officers to fine-tune. 
  Q: We notice some countries are not as ready as others 
to cut tariffs in some areas. 
  A: This is where the reasons are discussed. We all agreed 
that while we understand (why some are not ready to cut 
tariffs), we must now go back and look closer at the reasons. 
Some of the reasons are not very valid; they just simply are 
the lobby tactics of industries which want long-term protection. 
For those that have no valid economic reasons, we told our 
counterparts: "Please see to it that you review this." 
  Q: Within Asean, the bigger countries have different 
speeds of development such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and 
Thailand. Being bigger, they need more time to adjust to the 
demands of the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). Did this 
fact create any problems in reaching a consensus on how to 
improve Afta [ASEAN Free Trade Area] at the Awana meeting? 
  A: Not really. It's just that, in the past, each Asean 
country volunteered to offer tariff cuts in certain products. 
Now we have fine-tuned that. 
  We say, let's determine the common products. Let's say 
product A, B, C are available in all countries. We take those 
products, see if we can harmonise tariffs on them, see if we can 
reduce these tariffs together so that there is no inequitable 
treatment of domestic industries. Previously, you offered what 
you could. And then we haggled. 
  Q: Is it true that Afta has been slow, to the extent 
that there is a need to quicken the Afta process? 
  A: No, Afta is not slow. The Afta schedule has been such 
that it is not due to begin until now because we announced it 
last November, and we chose it to be such. 
  But now we say, harmonise our tariffs, bring them down at 
the 
same time -- within a shorter period. If we can do this for 
products in the fast track of Afta, we can do the same for 
products in the normal track. Eventually the net effect is that 
Afta will be realised in less than 15 years (as originally 
scheduled). 
  The fast track is eight years now; the old normal track is 
15. If we can make both categories go faster, naturally the net 
effect will be a faster rate. So we have deliberately not set 
any dates and time frame. We want business to look at our 
products first and let it (the process) evolve so that in a year 
or two, you will see that there are no more products that will 
go beyond 10 or 11 years. 
  Q: So there will be no specific time frame now? 
  A: At the moment, no. We've asked them (the officials) to 
look into it. But eventually when the officers have fine-tuned 
the products list, we may be able to come up with a schedule 
that reflects a rapid actualisation of Afta. 
  Q: And that rapid pace will have to be consistent with 
the WTO's programme? 
  A: No, not necessarily. What we want to do is to make our 
Afta tariff cuts better than our tariff cuts that were committed 
under the Uruguay Round. How can it be better? If we 
multilaterally (at GATT) offered 10 percent cuts in our tariffs, 
we should offer 5 
percent (more) to ourselves. That means the Asean Free Trade 
Area 
has got better tariffs than with the rest of the world. That's 
the 
target. 
  Q: But, at the moment, we do not see any consensus 
on a shortening of the Afta process or a "strengthening" of 
it. 
  A: We all agreed that, after the joint press conference (at 
Awana, Genting Highlands on April 23), individual ministers will 
make their announcements. So, wait for a few more days. 
  Q: What are the problems faced in the implementation 
of Afta? 
  A: One basic problem is the harmonisation of customs codes, 
which is a strengthening of the Afta process. Then you have 
preshipment problems. And the problem of standards. But what 
we face is an administrative problem. Most of them have to do 
with (the inconsistency in) customs nomenclatures. 
  Q: So the fundamental problem is an administrative 
one, and that is holding back Afta? 
  A: Not holding back, but constraining the free flow of trade 
using the CEPT (Afta's Common Effective Preferential Tariffs 
scheme). Trade can still happen, but if you use the CEPT, there 
are concessions. You enjoy tariff cuts. 
  Q: So if the proposal at Awana is adopted, there will 
be no more need for any CEPT fast track in Afta? 
  A: No. The fast track will still continue. What we can do 
is to include more items on the fast track, increase the items 
on the normal track, and shorten the time for the normal track 
and the fast track to be brought down to the lowest possible 
tariff levels. That's all we need to do. The fast track will be 
there, except that it will be faster. The normal track will 
also be faster. That's the net effect that we hope to see 
eventually after the study by the SEOM (Senior Economic 
Officials Meeting). 
  Q: Except that there will be no specific time frame 
for the faster Afta? 
  A: Well, if the SEOM suggests a time frame, why not? But at 
Awana, we did not set that. Unless within the next few days you 
hear something else, it will be safe to say that all of us are 
agreed that Afta will have to be made more real. 
  Q: The CEPT will now be expanded to include new 
elements such as raw agricultural products and services? 
  A: Yes. Raw agriculture is a very new element. It is a 
very important decision. Many of us are agriculture-based. If 
we can find common agricultural products that can be subjected 
to one harmonised tariff, and at the second stage, to tariff 
cuts to zero or to the lowest level -- at the same time -- then 
we should do it first. 
  Q: What's the significance of the proposed framework 
of cooperation in the services sector, which the ministers 
agreed to introduce? 
  A: The services sector is being looked at now because 
services have become important in global trading. The 
significance of the proposed framework is that in the past, 
we've had suggestions mooted by the various (Asean) committees. 
Many of these were not followed up. Yet there is room and 
potential for cooperation in transportation, tourism, 
professional services, and also in financial services. 
  Q: So, basically, the idea is to open up the area of 
services to each other? 
  A: Selected ones. Those which will not cause dislocation 
for domestic services and industries. We haven't identified 
them. The senior officials will look at it in greater detail. 
  Q: Do you anticipate some problems here, resistance 
from some industries? 
  A: Yes, that's why the senior officials have been asked to 
study it. So, we have to identify areas of least difficulty and 
move them first. 
  Q: What is the likelihood of this frame work being 
adopted? 
  A: Very likely. The framework will be discussed in greater 
detail in September. What we hope to do is to have this 
framework, if it is feasible, ready for the (Asean) leaders 
meeting next year. 
  Q: Was there any reservation on the part of the other 
countries? 
  A: What we have announced was based on consensus. We took 
note of reservations, but conceptually there was a consensus to 
have this studied. The formal decisions, one way or the other, 
will be made at the structured meetings. The next one is in 
September.

<F P=106> [Address delivered by Hong Chae-hyong, ROK minister of </F>
finance and governor for the ROK, at the 27th annual meeting of 
the ADB Board of Governors in Nice, France on 4 May] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, fellow governors, ladies and gentlemen: 
  I am very honored, on behalf of the Korean government, to 
address the 27th Annual Meeting of the ADB [Asian Development 
Bank] in this beautiful coastal city of Nice. On this occasion, 
I would like to join the other governors in expressing our 
appreciation to the people of Nice for their warm welcome and 
hospitality. Also, I would like to welcome the Republics of 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz to the Bank, and wish their successful 
integration into the Asian Pacific economy. Moreover, 
congratulations are due to President Sato who has been appointed 
to take on the important task of leading the Bank through this 
critical period facing the region. 
  Recently, however, some symptoms have surfaced which may 
cloud this optimistic outlook. First, contrary to our 
expectations, recent positive developments in the world trade 
system are being overshadowed by the unfortunate revival of 
bilateralism and unilateralism. Meanwhile, the continued strong 
growth of the DMC [Developing Member Country] economics and the 
relatively slack growth of the industrialized countries have 
recently altered the world trade structure. 
  While the proportion of trade between industrialized 
countries has declined, the opposite is true for trade between 
the DMCs and the industrialized countries, it is also true that 
such developments can occasionally engender economic conflicts 
and frictions that may in turn lead to unilateralism and 
bilateralism. Another problem that requires our attention is 
that of infrastructure shortages and transborder pollution. 
Present economic growth of the region cannot be maintained 
unless bottlenecks arising from insufficient infrastructures are 
effectively addressed to meet the growing demand. 
  According to the ADB's annual report, we will need to invest 
up to $1 trillion on physical infrastructure by the year 2000, 
if our economic development is to remain on course. In addition, 
rapid industrialization has brought on environmental problems 
that are now spilling pollution over to the neighboring 
countries. If not addressed in the early stage, this 
environmental problem will engender an enormous burden to the 
countries and the region concerned. It will be wiser to tackle 
the problem early on when costs are relatively low, than to 
defer it later only to discover spiral of costs. 
<H5>  ADB Policy Direction </H5>
  Mr. President: 
  I would like to applaud the Bank's efforts last year to 
reduce poverty, increase infrastructure investment, and protect 
the environment, and would also like to praise its efforts to 
improve the quality of projects. On this occasion, let me also 
suggest some further policy directions for the Bank. 
  First, I suggest the Bank strengthen its research activities 
to promote DMCs to transform their economies to more open ones, 
with proper emphasis given to the unique economic situations of 
the region. I also suggest that the Bank provide many more 
forums for the industrialized countries and DMCs to deepen their 
mutual understanding of the regional economy. The Bank can 
achieve these by actively assisting the APEC [Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] Finance Ministers' Meeting that was 
arranged to exchange experiences and lessons on economic policy 
of the finance ministers from the region. 
  Second, to address the problem of infrastructure shortage 
and 
its accompanying financing problem, I urge the Bank to undergo a 
comprehensive study relevant to the regional situation. While 
engaging in such research, the Bank should fully consider ways 
to effectively manage demand-side and meet the financial 
requirements. 
  Third, as for the regional environmental problem, I urge the 
Bank to pay special attention to the discussions within ESCAP 
[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific] and 
UNEP [United Nations Environment Program] that have become 
active since the Rio meeting in 1992. In line with this, the 
Bank should extend technical and financial assistance to address 
the problem of transborder air pollution and radioactive waste 
disposal. On this occasion, I am pleased to announce that Korea 
will be contributing from next year 4 mil. SDRs [special drawing 
rights] to the Global Environment Facility. 
<H5>  Korea and economic development </H5>
  Fellow governors: 
  Recently, Korea has been faced with two major challenges in 
the area of economic development. These are the challenge of 
liberalizing and opening the financial market, and the challenge 
of expanding our inadequate infrastructure investment. 
  First, we announced last June our comprehensive blueprint 
for 
financial liberalization and market opening. In connection with 
this, I should mention that we have not only faithfully 
implemented the liberalization measures as scheduled, but, in 
numerous cases, have also advanced them. And it is our firm 
determination to strengthen these efforts of financial 
liberalization in the future. Interest rate deregulation, 
relaxation of foreign exchange restrictions, and liberalization 
of overseas portfolio investment were the major areas of 
progress. 
  To further accelerate our foreign exchange and capital 
account liberalization, a medium-term reform plan will be 
announced by the end of this year that should significantly 
revamp our current foreign exchange system. Also, to make Korea 
a more favorable place for foreign direct investments, 
comprehensive policy measures will be announced next month to 
improve the financial and tax environment and to introduce 
convenient one-stop service for foreign investors. Moreover, 
starting early next year, ADB will be able to issue 
won-denominated bonds in the Korean market. This will contribute 
not only to the internationalization of our financial system, 
but also to the diversification of ADB's financing channels. 
  Now a word on infrastructure investment. In recent years, 
the 
supply of physical infrastructure became clearly inadequate to 
meet the demand arising in the course of our rapid economic 
growth. To solve this bottleneck of our economy, we are now 
again putting strong emphasis on infrastructure investment. As 
such, we have established an investment program amounting to $69 
billion between 1993 and 1997. And to secure the necessary 
funds, a transportation tax has been newly introduced and 
capital from the private sector will be actively invited. 
  Speaking of our economic cooperation we have significantly 
expanded our cooperation with the 3 DMCs. While our total trade 
increased 35 percent during the past five years, our trade with 
the DMCs increased 90 percent. And during the same period, 
whereas our overseas direct investment increased almost six 
times. In addition, almost 40 percent of the funds from our 
Economic Development Cooperation Fund, the main source of 
bilateral assistance, were extended to the Asian region. With a 
significant expansion of the Fund, the size of our financial 
assistance will quadruple this year. 
  Furthermore, we are now under the process of cofinancing 
with 
the ADB the power transmission project in the Philippines. This 
project, the first since the cofinancing agreement settled last 
June, is sure to be a stepping stone for further cofinancing in 
the region. 
<H5>  Concluding statement </H5>
  Mr. President, and fellow governors: 
  As a significant engine of the world economy, Asia has now 
emerged onto the global scene, attracting more interest than 
ever before from the nonregional countries. 
  Before long, time may come when the economic success of Asia 
will largely determine the progress of the world economy. Thus, 
the Bank has to develop a new growth strategy for the region 
tailored to the circumstances of the Asian countries which are 
now facing the wave of market opening pressures. And the 
regional member countries must double their efforts to maintain 
their role as the catalyst fueling the world economy. 
  With these efforts, I envision a future when the Bank's role 
will be defined not merely as a development bank, but as an 
organization with a broader obligation of forging closer the 
regional cooperation among the Asian countries. 
  Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Monetary Authorities Do Not Want Rapid </F>
Appreciation of the Yen"] 
  [Text] U.S. monetary authorities decided to intervene in 
the foreign exchange market by buying dollars as the yen 
exchange rate in the New York foreign exchange market reached 
almost 100 yen to a dollar. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd 
Bentsen made an unusual statement to the effect that excessive 
fluctuation is to be avoided, indicating a firm position to 
guard against the depreciation of the dollar. 
  The market has now awakened from its illusion that the U.S. 
authorities favor a policy of "inducing yen appreciation." It 
is now time to listen to the U.S. message that it does not want 
rapid appreciation of the yen. 
  The Federal Bank of New York started buying dollars to 
intervene in the market because the dollar was depreciating not 
only against the yen, but also against the German mark and other 
European currencies. If nothing were done about the situation, 
the dollar might depreciate rapidly. This would then stimulate 
the market's apprehensions about inflation, leading in turn to a 
triple drop in the value of the dollar, government bonds, and 
stock prices. This might then dampen the ongoing economic 
recovery in the United States. 
  Before going into dollar-buying and yen-selling, the Federal 
Bank of New York had already engaged in dollar-buying and 
mark-selling. Dollar-buying was undertaken not because the 
Japanese Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan requested such 
intervention, but rather because of domestic circumstances in 
the United States. Actually, this was a dollar stabilization 
policy aimed at avoiding any confusion in the U.S. market and 
securing the U.S. economy on the track of recovery. 
  At the Tokyo foreign exchange market and other foreign 
exchange markets all over the world, there had been persistent 
speculations that the Clinton administration is bent on inducing 
yen appreciation to correct the trade imbalance between Japan 
and the United States. However, in a floating rate system, 
without monetary policy coordination and powerful concerted 
intervention, verbal intervention can only influence the market 
temporarily. 
  If, as the market speculated, the U.S. monetary authorities' 
strategy were to induce dollar depreciation and yen 
appreciation, it would have to lower interest rates and engage 
in dollar-selling. However, what the U.S. authorities did was 
the exact opposite. Short-term interest rates were raised 
thrice, and the monetary authorities also moved to buy dollars. 
It is said that U.S. monetary officials are strongly critical 
of economist Fred Bergsten's statement on inducing yen 
appreciation. 
  The market is still expecting the yen to appreciate in the 
future. The prevailing view is that Japan's huge current 
accounts surplus will serve as pressure on the yen to increase 
its value. However, there is a great gap between the economic 
conditions in the United States and those in Japan and Germany. 
As the United States implements a tight monetary policy, 
Germany continues to adopt an easy monetary policy, and Japan 
also maintains a basically easy monetary policy. There is also 
an interest rate gap. From the economic fundamentals, there 
should not be any substantial pressure for the yen to appreciate. 
  Furthermore, there are quite a number of political factors 
that should encourage the selling of yen, such as the unstable 
Japanese political situation, and the explosive situation on the 
Korean peninsula. There is speculation in the market that the 
political instability will make Japan unable to bring about a 
breakthrough in its frictions with the United States. However, 
the U.S. Government has decided to postpone sanctions against 
Japan in such areas as government procurement in consideration 
of the Japanese political situation. It is even more unlikely 
that the United States will choose to apply pressure to 
appreciate the yen in order to place the Hata administration in 
an extremely difficult position. 
  The exchange rate is decided by the market. In that sense, 
the market should reflect accurate information. This time, the 
market will probably get the message of the U.S. monetary 
authorities. Needless to say, regardless of whether the Hata 
administration will be a stable government or not, timely 
measures should be taken to expand domestic demand and relax 
government regulations in order to reduce the current accounts 
surplus, which is a root cause of the volatility of the foreign 
exchange market.

  [Text] The New York Federal Bank has decided to buy 
greenbacks and sell yen. In response, the Bundesbank in Germany 
and central banks in European nations have made clear their 
postures to keep the dollar from further falling in its value by 
launching their coordinated intervention in foreign exchange 
markets to buy dollars. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen has 
issued an emergency statement asserting that a further slide in 
the dollar's value would serve no purpose. In reaction, the Bank 
of Japan [BOJ] has assigned the London Bank to intervene in 
currency markets. In the wake of the most massive coordinated 
intervention by the currency authorities of Japan, the United 
States, and European nations in the currency markets to buy 
dollars, the yen's exchange rate against the dollar, which had 
been approaching a historic high, has plummeted to 102 yen per 
$1. 
  Commenting on the coordinated intervention by major 
industrialized nations in currency markets to buy dollars, a BOJ 
source made it clear on 4 May that Japan will aggressively 
intervene in currency markets to keep the yen from rising 
steeply in its value against the dollar, saying, "We will do 
everything we can to keep the yen's exchange against the dollar 
stable in the future." The BOJ source welcomed the coordinated 
effort by the United States and European nations to buy 
greenbacks and said, "The BOJ strongly supports a statement 
issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen." The the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF] has said: "It cannot be said that recent 
fluctuation on foreign exchange markets reflects economic 
fundamentals. Japan, too, is concerned about that fluctuation" 
(according to the International Finance Bureau of the MOF). The 
MOF also has made it clear that Japan will make the coordinated 
intervention in the currency markets in concert with the 
currency authorities of other major industrialized nations. 
  A source well versed in the currency markets has said, "With 
the coordinated intervention in currency markets to buy dollars, 
it has become difficult for Japan to continue selling dollars." 
There is a view that despite the massive coordinated 
intervention, the dollar's rise in its value has been relatively 
minor. The same source also has said that Japan will watch 
whether the currency authorities of other industrialized nations 
will continue their intervention in the foreign exchange markets 
to buy greenbacks. 
  In response to the coordinated intervention by the United 
States and major European nations in currency markets to buy 
dollars and the statement issued by U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Bentsen, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii on the evening of 4 May 
issued an statement saying, "Japan shares the common perception 
that recent drastic fluctuation in the currency markets cannot 
be justified from the standpoint of economic fundamentals." In 
the statement, the finance minister pointed out the U.S. 
intervention in the currency markets as an "evidence of 
cooperative relations between Japan and the United States" and 
expressed the hope that the speculative selling of the dollar 
and purchase of the yen will be stopped. He also indicted that 
the Japanese Government intends to aggressively intervened in 
foreign exchange markets in the future.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 7 May Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] It is expected that in order to provide breakthrough 
in the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Councilor 
Sozaburo Okamatsu of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] will visit the United States early next week and 
hold unofficial negotiations with U.S. counterparts in charge of 
trade, a government source disclosed on 6 May. The source said 
that in unofficial negotiations, Okamatsu, in an attempt to seek 
ways to resume and reach an agreement on the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks before the industrialized nations meeting 
(Naples summit), will exchange opinions on macroeconomics 
policies designed to solve the issue of Japan's trade surplus 
and how to interpret and set up "objective criteria" for each 
trade sector. 
  Councilor Okamatsu, together with MITI Minister Eijiro Hata, 
is scheduled to attend a two-day East-West meeting of economic, 
industrial, and trade ministers to be held in Warsaw on 6-7 May. 
After the meeting, Councilor Okamatsu will fly straight to the 
United States. Although the main purpose of his U.S. visit is 
to deliver a lecture there, the government source said that, 
after the lecture, he plans to meet with U.S. officials such as 
Cutter, deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president (in 
charge of economic policies), who is a member of the National 
Economic Council (NEC) and is one of those who are in charge of 
trade affairs. 
  The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have been deadlocked 
following the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 
February in concluding the economic framework talks. Former 
Foreign Minister (currently Prime Minister) Tsutomu Hata, in 
talks with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor in Morocco on 15 
April, confirmed that the two nations will make efforts to 
resume the economic framework talks. Moreover, in late April, a 
top MITI leader said: "There have been differences between the 
two nations in views on overall objective of the framework 
talks. If we discuss this matter, we will be able to find ways 
to resume the talks." In this way, the top official hinted that 
unofficial vice ministerial talks will be held after the May 
holidays. 
  A visit to the United States by MITI Councilor Okamatsu 
signifies that unofficial negotiations will virtually start. It 
is observed that with his negotiations as the start, 
behind-the-scenes unofficial negotiations involving the USTR 
will get under way, in hopes of resuming the economic framework 
talks before the Naples summit is held.

  [Text] Damascus, 7 May -- Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
held a meeting on 6 May with reporters, who are traveling with 
him, and commented on the Japan-U.S. new economic talks, saying: 
"As long as free economy and free trade are foundations of 
Japan and the United States, I think it is not logical for the 
United States to demand Japan to set numerical targets. I have 
a feeling that determining it is not logical to call for 
numerical targets, the United States is beginning to realize 
that such a demand will not gain support from the world opinion." 
  The foreign minister held a meeting with U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher in Cairo on 3 May. According to the foreign 
minister, the secretary of state said at the meeting that "we 
are not demanding Japan to set numerical targets." It seems 
that the foreign minister's remarks were based on Christopher's 
comment.

have basically reached a compromise on the Japan-Europe 
semiconductor accord during an unofficial meeting held before

  [Text] Russia has asked Itochu Corporation, a major 
Japanese trading firm, and JAMCO, a Japanese aircraft parts 
manufacturer, to use their interior-design technology and funds 
to participate in the development of a high-tech jumbo jet 
airliner [the Ilyushin-96M, capable of carrying 386 passengers]. 
This was disclosed on 3 May by a Russian official in charge of 
the development project. Negotiations have continued between 
Russia and the Japanese firms for nearly a year through the 
mediation of a major U.S. aircraft manufacturer. There is a 
possibility the Japanese firms will make major moves toward 
participating in the development project once the prospect of 
raising funds is opened and Russia's plans for the repayment of 
their investments are confirmed. 
  Russia hopes the Japanese firms will provide full 
technological assistance in designing the passenger cabin of the 
Ilyushin-96M and in manufacturing aircraft parts. Major points 
of the proposals made by Russia during the negotiations are: 1) 
The passenger cabin is jointly designed; 2) the Japanese firms 
manufacture kitchen and toilet facilities; 3) Russian 
participants manufacture ceiling and ceiling storage cabins; and 
4) the passenger cabin (measuring 15 meters in length) prototype 
is displayed at the Paris Air Show scheduled for June this year 
if it is ready in time. 
  With regard to the funds, Russia has asked the Japanese 
firms 
to provide approximately $3 million as the initial cost of the 
development project. So far, Russia has asked them to invest 
$25 million in the development project, but it is said to have 
cut the amount by one-eighth in an attempt to lure the Japanese 
firms into the project.

  [Text] At a time when the process of creating a dialogue 
framework for the security of the Asia Pacific region is in 
progress, it is learned that Australia has informally sounded 
out Japan about military exchanges with a proposal to have 
officers of the Self-Defense Forces study at Australia's 
military academy. In the Asia Pacific region, ASEAN members have 
been making brisk moves toward creating a regional security 
system following the end of the Cold War, and Australia's bid 
for exchanges with Japan in the defense area is interpreted as 
an indication that nations in the region are showing great 
interest in Japan not only in the economic area, but in the 
security area. 
  Australia has begun reviewing its post-Cold War security 
strategy. It has recently compiled a basic defense plan, 
analyzing that, "although U.S. influence on the security of the 
Asia Pacific region has waned, the military presence of China, 
Japan, and India in the region has grown." Australia is believed 
to have sounded out Japan about military exchanges between the 
two countries with the aim of making it clear that it also 
places importance on Asian nations in the security area. 
  Japan has responded to Australia's proposal by simply 
saying, 
"We will study" out of consideration for our position of 
attaching importance to relations with the United States. Japan, 
however, plans to make a final decision on the Australian 
proposal after analyzing the situation in the Asia Pacific 
region. 
  The Asia Pacific region has yet to build its own collective 
security system because of its ethnic and cultural diversity. 
With regard to multilateral dialogue for the regional security, 
the "ASEAN region forum" is set to hold its first session this 
year and it will be attended by ASEAN member nations' foreign 
ministerial conference, Japan, the United States, China, and 
Russia.

  [Text] The government believes "it is essential to carry 
out structural economic reform, including deregulation, while 
making market intervention in coordination with other nations" 
in order to address the problem of the sharply rising value of 
the yen. The government will quickly work out concrete and 
detailed measures by the end of June. Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will attend meetings of administrative vice ministers of 
all ministries and agencies on 9 May to urge positive action on 
deregulation. He will also reaffirm the government stance on 
deregulation at economic cabinet ministers' talks to be held on 
10 May. 
  To prevent a further rise in the yen's value on the foreign 
exchange market, the government has decided it is most important 
not only to take direct measures, such as market intervention, 
but also to promote economic reform at home--for instance, by 
easing regulations and ensuring continued expansion of domestic 
demand.

  [Text] The government has disclosed a guideline for 
deregulation measures to be mapped out before the end of June. 
The guideline focuses on such fields as importing procedures, 
authorization system, and distribution rules. As tangible 
measures, the guideline calls for review of 51 regulations in 16 
categories, including a step-by-step abolition of the 
Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, a removal of ban on holding 
companies, and expansion of farmers' direct rice supply to 
consumers. The government intends to hammer out drastic 
deregulation plans to relax Japan-U.S. trade frictions through 
liberalization of the domestic markets and correction of 
disparity in Japanese and international prices. However, some 
ministries are likely to oppose implementation of the 
comprehensive deregulation guidelines. 
  The deregulation guideline is prepared as the foundation for 
intragovernment negotiations to finalize deregulation measures. 
The guideline is roughly divided into two sections on 
distribution and import regulations. Subjects for policy review 
add up to 27 regulations in 10 categories of distribution rules, 
and 24 regulations in six categories of importing rules. On 12 
and 18 May, the guideline will be introduced to government 
agencies by the Administrative Reform Promotion Council's 
Subcommittee for Promoting Imports, Improving Market Access, and 
Reforming the Nation's Distribution System. 
  Regarding the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, which is 
provided for protecting smaller retail stores from new 
large-scale stores, the government has relaxed opening-hour 
restrictions for large-scale stores effective 1 May. However, 
business circles are calling for abolition rather than 
relaxation of the law. Under such circumstances, the government 
decided to study possibilities of future abolition of the law on 
a step-by-step basis. Since changes in business-hours 
restriction must be coordinated with local watchdog bodies, the 
government intends to remove the rule from the books. Local 
legislation authority for controlling the size of new retail 
stores will be limited by the revised law in this connection. 
  With respect to restriction on establishment of holding 
companies, the government intends to abolish Article 9 of the 
Antimonopoly Law so that venture companies and financial 
institutions can open new businesses more smoothly. If the ban 
on holding companies is lifted, companies would become able to 
smoothly found or merge subsidiaries depending on their business 
strategies. While the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is wary of 
the system because it may give excessive market controlling 
power to major companies, Western multibusiness companies are 
demanding the holding company system in Japan. 
  The government is also planning an early abolition of resale 
price support contracts for pharmaceutical and beauty products. 
In 1992, the FTC reduced items for resale price support 
contracts from 51 to 26. At that time, the price support system 
was left for such products as lipsticks, lotion, and cold 
medicine until the next policy review in 1998, but the 
government intends to frontload the policy review. 
  In addition, the government plans to deregulate self-service 
in gas stations and farmers' direct rice sales to consumers. 
  Before the end of June, the government is supposed to work 
out a package of deregulation measures to "promote imports, 
improve market access, and reform the nation's distribution 
system," as well as those to deregulate the "housing and real 
estate" and "telecommunications" sectors. Deregulation is being 
promoted in view of not only U.S. demands for market 
liberalization, but also the Japanese business sector's wish for 
removal of all business restrictions.

  [Text] Japan's imports of semiconductors have risen 
sharply. Japan is a major memory-manufacturing nation turning 
out 4-megabit DRAM (dynamic random-assess memory); however, as a 
result of growing export demand from American personal computer 
manufacturers, Japan has been in short supply of memories, which 
has resulted in boosting their imports to make up for the 
shortfall. The sharp rise in Japan's memory imports has 
"unexpectedly" served to meet a "20- percent share of 
foreign-made semiconductors on the Japanese chip market" under 
the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement, known as being typical 
of a numerical target. 
  The sharp rise in Japan's memory imports has been noticeable 
since early this year. 
  According to trade statistics compiled by the Finance 
Ministry, Japan imported a total of 99,764,510 memories during 
the January-March quarter, a jump of 1.5 times over the same 
period of last year. Japan's memory imports during the first 
three months this year exceeded its total memory imports for 
1988. The view is already surfacing that Japan's memory imports 
this year will certainly exceed last year's all-time high of 313 
million memories. 
  South Korea has become a top supplier of memories to Japan 
in 
terms of volume and amount, and most of the memories are 
believed to be 4-megabit DRAM. Against the background of the 
economic recovery in the United States, such major Japanese 
semiconductor manufacturers as NEC Corp., Hitachi Ltd., and 
Toshiba Corp. have exported nearly 70 percent of their 4-megabit 
DRAM that is used in the manufacture of personal computers, 
thereby triggering the short supply in Japan. The Electronic 
Industries Association of Japan has said, "Japanese personal 
computer makers and memory users have coped with the short 
supply by importing South Korean-made memories." 
  The trend of high memory prices at home has forced the 
Japanese personal computer makers and memory users to import 
memories from abroad to keep their businesses profitable. 
Japanese personal computer makers have aggressively imported 
foreign-made EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) and 
other memories that are technologically superior to domestically 
made memories, and this has become a factor in Japan's growing 
imports of memories. 
  A researcher at the electronics group of the Nomura Research 
Institute, who is well versed in the domestic and foreign 
semiconductor situations, has said, "As Japanese semiconductor 
makers have increasingly shunned the production of DRAM, South 
Korean semiconductor manufacturers, who increased their supply 
capabilities, needed to boost their semiconductor exports to 
Japan so Japan's imports of DRAM's are expected to grow in the 
future."

<F P=106> [Interview with Atsushi Kanda, director general of the </F>
Defense Agency, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the 
post-Cold War international situation? 
  [Kanda] I cannot be sure if world security improved 
following the end of the Cold War. If you look at the national 
conflicts in the former Soviet Union, you realize it is 
difficult to simply say the end of the Cold War between the two 
superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, brought 
peace. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What kind of action do you think 
Japan can take to deal with North Korea's suspected nuclear 
weapons development if Japan, the United States, and the ROK 
decide to take action without waiting for the UN Security 
Council's decision to impose sanctions against North Korea? 
  [Kanda] One thing we must know is whether there is enough 
evidence to support the view that Japan, the United States, and 
the ROK will take action. We should not get carried away. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some members of the ruling coalition 
parties are saying Japan should attach importance to joint 
actions with the United States in dealing with the North Korean 
issue. 
  [Kanda] Needless to say, we will adhere to UN resolutions, 
otherwise we will have no grounds for taking action. I do not 
know who in the ruling parties is saying this. However, I can 
say that, in the spirit of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan 
will fully cooperate with the United States. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you agree with the government's 
current interpretation of the Constitution regarding the right 
of collective self-defense? 
  [Kanda] Japan should act within the scope of the 
Constitution. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think the government may 
change its interpretation of the Constitution depending on the 
situation? 
  [Kanda] The government may talk about new ways of thinking 
if the situation requires. It is possible the government may 
change its way of thinking to cope with the changing situation. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does this mean the government is 
taking into consideration the worst possible scenario for the 
Korean peninsula? 
  [Kanda] There are various possible scenarios. However, I do 
think the worst scenario can happen. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Can you comment on an ideal way for 
cooperating with UN peacekeeping operations (PKO)? 
  [Kanda] This deals with the issue of where Japan should send 
its PKO team after Mozambique. However, we would like to 
actively deal with this issue. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But PKO cooperation laws impose a 
freeze on joining UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). 
  [Kanda] Regarding the PKF, we agreed to review the relevant 
laws after three years. Therefore, we will have to begin 
discussions on this issue soon. We would like to carefully 
study this issue because complicated problems are involved in it. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people are saying Japan should 
not send its Self-Defense Forces [SDF] abroad for PKO 
cooperation, but instead members of other organizations. 
  [Kanda] Judging from previously expressed views of the 
Defense Agency [DA], it seems to me the DA is determined not to 
establish another organization for PKO cooperation. An attempt 
to dispatch members from non-SDF organizations for PKO 
operations will deprive the SDF of its roles in terms of money 
and manpower. The SDF is enough to fulfill our responsibilities 
regarding PKO cooperation. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What about the summit between you and 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry? 
  [Kanda] I still cannot say anything about a trip to the 
United States or the talks. However, I need to actively attend 
various meetings if there will be change, such as new 
developments in North Korea, for example. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal 
with the concept of theater missile defense (TMD) which the 
United States is promoting? 
  [Kanda] It needs to be studied quickly. While the SDF feels 
uneasy about Japan's current (missile defense) system, the TMD 
is a concept based on advanced science and technology. I would 
like to study the TMD concept in a positive manner. 
  This will be useful in terms of strengthening our joint 
functions [kyodo kino] in restoring our security. However, I 
would like to carefully study the concept because we would need 
a large amount of the budget to introduce the TMD. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The bills designed to revise the SDF 
laws were carried over to the current Diet session. 
  [Kanda] The SDF is responsible for protecting the Japanese 
people. Therefore, it is a matter of course to send SDF 
aircraft to save Japanese living abroad. In this regard, the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is also changing its 
stance, becoming positive about the bills. However, since it 
seceded from the coalition government, I suppose the SDPJ is now 
assuming a prudent stand. I would like to deal with the issue 
while listening to various opinions, including that of the SDPJ. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ's secession 
from the ruling coalition will have an impact on defense 
policies? 
  [Kanda] They should not say they have nothing to do with 
defense policies because they are no longer a member of the 
coalition. Since the SDPJ chairman signed the policy agreement, 
the party must respect it. I want the SDPJ to know that it has 
heavy responsibilities to fulfill.

<F P=106> [Article by Hisayoshi Ina; from the "The Hata </F>
Administration: Mounting Problems" series; part three of a 
three-part series: "Apprehension About Crisis Management 
Concerning North Korean Issue: Increasing Importance of 
Repairing Japan-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text] What caused the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] to leave the administration? Nuclear suspicions 
involving the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] is 
one cause. The SDPJ was forced to leave the administration 
because the coalition government had to take into consideration 
its capability in dealing with the crisis if an unforeseen 
situation takes place. However, ironically the coalition 
government's foundation has been weakened with the SDPJ leaving 
the administration, and at least temporarily has lowered its 
capability for crisis management. 
<H5>  It Has Become Difficult To Form a Consensus </H5>
  During the Cold War, the positions of the Japanese political 
parties were determined by their distance with the United States 
or the USSR. At the start of the Hata administration, instead 
of this criterion, the stance of the Japanese political parties 
in dealing with the problems involving North Korea became one of 
the criteria in determining their positions, at least for the 
time being. In the process of forming the coalition 
government's policy consensus, which has become a scrap paper, 
Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party] Ichiro Ozawa used the various 
cards in persistently requesting the SDPJ to compromise. 
  Persons concerned with the coalition parties admit that 
Ozawa 
intended to give priority to internal affairs by "first 
cornering the SDPJ, and second by sending the message to the 
United States that we are taking this problem seriously." As a 
result, the coalition parties have made at least two mistakes. 
  First, more discrepancies than consensus have been revealed 
among the coalition parties, which the coalition parties managed 
to patch up through political measures. If this becomes known 
to the public, it will be difficult to form a national consensus 
which is indispensable in dealing with the crisis. Second, it 
has become apparent that no consideration is being paid to the 
People's Republic of China [PRC] in the process of arguments. 
We should say Japan has committed a serious diplomatic error 
when we consider the significance of the PRC. 
  Actually, Japan can shoulder its responsibilities in the 
international community so long as its actions are based on 
three key principles--the Constitution, the Japan-U.S. security 
structure, and the United Nations. However, in part, Japan 
could not do so because the national discussion on the issue is 
still immature. 
  On one hand, there are people who argue that economic 
sanctions are indispensable in order to make North Korea give up 
its nuclear development and therefore a naval blockade may 
become necessary in effecting the sanction. Their argument 
sounds as if they are prepared to fight a war. On the other 
hand, there are those who see the situation optimistically 
without grounds simply because they want to avert their eyes 
from such a worst-case scenario. Though the attitude of the 
latter group is out of the question, the former group is also to 
blame in the sense they tend to unnecessarily stir up a sense of 
crisis. 
  The UN Security Council will take step-by-step sanctions if 
North Korea does not agree to undergo inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As expected, the PRC 
will also make its intention clear during the process, and as 
exports to the country are not to be totally banned immediately, 
it is not realistic to talk about a naval blockade. If the 
countries concerned intend to impose sanctions by themselves, 
their sanctions will also be imposed step by step. 
  The countries concerned are also in agreement that the 
window 
for negotiations should be kept open in order not to uselessly 
incite North Korea. There is no need to uselessly create a 
sense of crisis. At the same time, we should realize more 
seriously the negative aspects of the crisis to be created if 
North Korea declares that it is armed with nuclear weapons. 
  Discussions May Take Place on Nuclear Armaments 
  In order to cope with the threat of a nuclear-armed North 
Korea, the United States will try to maintain a nuclear 
deterrent by including allied countries such as Japan and the 
Republic of Korea [ROK] under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. 
However, if North Korea becomes so desperate it is not afraid 
of being attacked with nuclear weapons, it is possible the logic 
of deterrence may no longer hold true. Some people may claim 
that Japan should be armed with nuclear weapons, and in certain 
cases it may be difficult to convince these people that such an 
option is not necessary. 
  The fact that the arms race is beginning in northeast Asia 
is 
not the only problem. North Korea's behavior might incite other 
countries such as Iraq, Iran, and others subjected to nuclear 
suspicion. It might might also jeopardize the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) structure. If military tension 
is intensified in the Middle East, with nuclear issues as the 
background, it could even affect the trend of petroleum 
supplies, creating confusion in the world economy as a whole. 
  Russia is another dangerous neighbor which is strengthening 
its nationalistic tendency. Former presidential assistant 
Zbigniew Brzezinski expressed anxiety that "Russia is aiming at 
becoming an imperial rather than a democratic state." U.S. 
strategic experts consider the possibility of a new Cold War 
taking place as a result of the confrontation between Russia and 
Ukraine. 
  Prime Minister Hata is regarded as "a person able to see 
things from the standpoint of the general public." However, 
amateurism should be excluded as far as diplomatic and security 
problems are concerned. In that sense, the first thing the 
prime minister should do is correct the course of the amateurish 
diplomacy laid out by Hosokawa, who tried to explain the failure 
of the Japan-U.S. summit as "relations of mature men." When we 
take into account the cloudy situation seen in North Korea and 
Russia, we realize what the prime minister should do is to 
repair Japan-U.S. relations. 
  In the White House administration of former President Nixon, 
who died recently, all diplomatic papers used to be written 
taking U.S.-Soviet relations into consideration. Even in 
producing papers on U.S.-Uruguay relations, it was necessary to 
analyze the possible influence the papers might have on 
U.S.-Soviet relations. 
<H5>  A Way Out Not in Sight </H5>
  The USSR has disappeared, and the Clinton administration 
does 
not maintain the habit of seeing everything in the context of 
U.S.-Soviet relations. However, even after the end of the Cold 
War, the significance of the United States to Japan has not 
decreased at all. The Japan-U.S. security structure is already 
functioning as a system capable of dealing with the post-Cold 
War threat. Every diplomatic policy should be considered in the 
context of Japan-U.S. relations. If people feel that such a way 
of thinking is a Cold War-oriented attitude, they are mistaken. 
  J. Hodge, chief editor of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, wrote a short 
article in the latest issue entitled "From Chaos to Order." The 
shift from the Hosokawa to the Hata administration might also 
have been a process of seeking for a new order. However, no 
outlet from the chaos has been found yet.

  [Text] Thailand has mapped out plans for the use of water 
from the Salween River as stated in the treaty concerning 
watershed for international rivers. Minister to the Prime 
Minister's Office Sawit Phothiwihok and Director General of the 
Department of Energy Affairs Prathet Sutabut explained the plans 
to Myanmar [Burma] authorities during their visit to Myanmar. 
  The Thai delegation has made it clear to the Myanmar side 
that the treaty made between Thailand and Britain on demarcation 
line between Thailand and then-Burma stated that both countries 
have equal claim over water flow in the Salween River. The Thai 
authorities told their Myanmar counterpart that Thailand's 
project to divert water from the Salween River to the Phumiphon 
Dam in Tak Province will be within Thailand's legitimate claim 
over water use. They have informed the Myanmar side that the 
Department of Energy Affairs and the Electricity Generating 
Authority of Thailand will jointly implement the project which 
will first take three months to plan as a comprehensive water 
management plan involving five tributaries of the Salween River. 
They explained that the oversupply of water in the Salween and 
its tributaries will only flow out to the sea without benefiting 
anyone on its (?path).

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Nothing specific has been 
decided between Japan and the United States on ways to resume 
the stalled trade "framework" talks, a senior ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said Monday [9 
May]. 
  But Tokyo will use "every level of communication tools" to 
break the impasse over the bilateral trade talks, Hideaki 
Kumano, vice MITI minister, told a press conference. 
  Kumano said Tokyo and Washington have yet to fix a timetable 
and other details for an early resumption of the deadlocked 
framework negotiations. 
  Kumano denied speculation that vice MITI minister for 
international affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu, the chief Japanese 
trade negotiator for the framework talks, will meet high-ranking 
U.S. trade officials during his ongoing visit to the U.S. 
  Okamatsu is in the U.S. only to deliver a speech at a 
Chicago 
college, and will return home Thursday, Kumano said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata 
said Monday [9 May] he and U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
have agreed to do their utmost for an early reopening of the 
stalled trade "framework" talks. The accord was reached when 
Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Hata met with 
Brown during an east-west conference of trade ministers that was 
held in Warsaw for two days until Saturday. 
  Hata told a news conference that he and Brown shared the 
view 
that an early resumption of the framework talks would meet 
expectations not only of both countries but of the global 
community. But he said he has clarified anew to Brown Tokyo's 
stance against numerical targets as a tool to measure foreign 
access to Japanese markets. 
  Hata said the meeting with Brown did not touch on specifics 
of three U.S. demands presented to Tokyo earlier as conditions 
to resume the framework talks. But both parties agreed that 
accords on the conditions should be struck before the July 
summit of the seven leading economic powers in Naples, Hata said. 
  During the April meeting between then Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, now prime minister, and U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, Washington demanded that 
Japan offer new proposals on a macroeconomic policy, overall 
goals of the framework talks and "objective criteria" to gauge 
openness of Japan's markets. 
  On the recent controversial remarks by former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano over the 1937 Nanjing massacre, the 
trade minister said the cabinet of Prime Minister Hata has been 
"damaged greatly." 
  Japan should "deepen its regret" over wartime conducts 
toward 
the next year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, 
Hata said. 
  Nagano said in an interview with a newspaper that the 
Nanjing 
massacre was a fabrication, a remark sparking global criticism 
and forcing his resignation as justice minister.

  [Text] Moscow, May 6 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's 
behind-the-scenes power broker, clandestinely paid a three-day 
visit to Moscow without detection by the mass media, a Japanese 
diplomatic source said Friday. 
  The source told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the embassy has not 
confirmed any contacts between Ozawa and Russian politicians at 
least during the day but said he is unsure whether they were 
made at night. "Only his wife (Kazuko) and bodyguard 
accompanied him," he said. "The embassy was told that he came 
here to investigate the political and economic situation." 
  "However, in actuality, he appears to have come here for the 
sake of sightseeing and to take a rest," he said. 
  Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito and the arch ally of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. He is credited with playing a key 
part in sweeping Hata to power. 
  In March 1991, Ozawa, then secretary general of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, flew to Moscow for talks with then Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev on such issues as the dispute on the 
sovereignty over four Russian-held islands off Japan's northern 
shore.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Foreign Ministry said 
Monday [9 May] that it has advised 92 Japanese in Yemen to leave 
immediately as hostilities continued to grow between rival 
northern and southern army units. 
  Japan is trying to have the Japanese evacuated on the 
seagoing vessels or emergency aircraft of other nations, 
government sources said. 
  On Saturday, the Japanese Embassy in Sanna urged Japanese 
residents and tourists to evacuate the Yemeni capital. 
  A total of 84 Japanese, including embassy related personnel, 
are reportedly in Sanna with five Japanese in the old northern 
city of Mafraq and another three in the old southern capital of 
Aden.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan's current account 
surplus for fiscal 1993 rose an unadjusted 3.3 percent from the 
previous year to hit a record for the second consecutive year, 
the Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report Monday [9 May]. 
  The politically sensitive surplus that represents trade in 
goods and services totaled 130.04 billion dollars, the ministry 
said. But for the latest reporting month of March alone, the 
unadjusted current account gap fell 16.1 percent from a 
year-earlier level to 15.76 billion dollars, underscoring the 
recent downward trend. 
  The fiscal 1993 unadjusted trade surplus -- the major 
component --on a contract settlement basis increased 4.9 percent 
to 142.80 billion dollars, with exports gaining 6.1 percent to 
356.00 billion dollars and imports rising 6.9 percent to 213.20 
billion dollars, the ministry said. 
  The March contract-settled trade surplus fell 0.7 percent to 
15.22 billion dollars, with exports gaining 5.3 percent to 35.61 
billion dollars and imports climbing 10.3 percent to 20.39 
billion dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan's surplus in trade and 
services edged up 3.3 percent in fiscal 1993 to its second 
straight record but seems to be nearing a peak, the Finance 
Ministry said Monday [9 May]. 
  The politically sensitive current account surplus, measuring 
goods, services and some unilateral transfers like grant aid, 
hit 130.04 billion dollars before adjustment for seasonal 
factors in the year ended in March, the ministry said in a 
preliminary report. 
  In yen terms, the surplus receded for the first time in 
three 
years and within the current account, the trade surplus shrank 
in volume terms, a ministry official said. 
  "It seems to [be] peaking out" in dollar terms as well, he 
said, although the critical dollar-denominated figure is at the 
mercy of such variables as exchange rates and oil prices. 
  The surplus grew in dollar terms during the first two 
quarters of the fiscal year from year-earlier levels, then 
shrank in the second two quarters, the official said. 
  The fiscal 1993 trade surplus rose 4.9 percent on a 
balance-of-payments basis to 142.80 billion dollars. Imports, 
growing 6.9 percent to 213.20 billion dollars, outstripped the 
growth of exports, which were up 6.1 percent to 356.00 billion 
dollars. 
  For March alone, the current account surplus fell 16.1 
percent from the same month a year before to 15.76 billion 
dollars, although the official said monthly figures are too 
volatile to set a trend. 
  The March trade surplus fell 0.7 percent from a year before 
to 15.22 billion dollars, with imports up 10.3 percent to 20.40 
billion dollars and exports up 5.3 percent to 35.61 billion 
dollars. 
  Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Center, 
agreed that Japan's towering current account surplus has peaked. 
"It will fall in this fiscal year," he said. 
  There will be months of swelling amid the contraction but 
the 
trend is toward a gradually narrowing imbalance, Takagi said. 
  Export growth continues to slow, the ministry official said, 
while import growth remains firm. 
  Indeed, the yen-denominated surplus shrank 10.3 percent in 
fiscal 1993 and the trade surplus slimmed 9.1 percent, with both 
posting double-digit declines in March, he said. 
  The surpluses, in closely watched dollar terms, continue to 
be swayed by the yen's historic rise over the past year. The 
yen value used by the ministry for export prices soared 15.7 
percent in fiscal 1993 to an average 108.17 yen to the dollar. 
  A higher yen is expected to curb Japan's surplus over time 
by 
making exports pricier in foreign currencies and imports cheaper 
in yen terms. But in the short run, a high yen inflates the 
dollar-denominated figures, causing the surplus to look like an 
inverted letter "J" on a graph. 
  "The J-curve effect is over," Takagi said. He said it is 
possible that the current account surplus could meet the 
government's forecast of shrinking to 2.8 percent of the gross 
domestic product this fiscal year from around 3.1 percent the 
year before. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said a "downward trend has 
emerged" in the current account surplus, noting the volume and 
yen-based declines. He told a regular press conference, "I 
think it will continue to decline." 
  Chief economist Jesper Koll at S.G. Warburg Securities 
(Japan) Inc. predicted a sharper decline, noting the 
four-quarter decline in yen terms and the two quarters of 
shrinkage even in dollar terms. 
  "I think it's going to fall like a rock," he said, reckoning 
that at the current pace the current account surplus would be 
less than 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) by the end 
of December. 
  "The dynamics are coming through in all the numbers," Koll 
said. "Imports are growing at double-digits, and exports are 
flattish." 
  Among the rising imports were semiconductors and wood 
products, the ministry official said. Although crude oil 
imports were nearly flat by volume, the price dropped 13 percent 
to an average 16.73 dollars a barrel in fiscal 1993, depressing 
the dollar figure, he said. 
  Automobiles were among the export decliners, the official 
said, but semiconductors and auto parts surged. Strong U.S. 
demand has helped those sectors in recent months even as other 
Japanese exporters have been crippled by the high yen. 
  In addition to the visible trade flows, Japan posted a 
deficit in services of 5.77 billion dollars in fiscal 1993, 
expanding 15.0 percent, the ministry said. The March services 
surplus shrank 58.3 percent to 1.78 billion dollars.

  [Text] Brussels, May 6 KYODO -- Japan's Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said Friday [6 May] the recent "excessive surge" in 
the yen is unfavorable. 
  In a press conference in Brussels, Hata said he wants the 
Bank of Japan to respond to foreign exchange rate movements 
while maintaining close contact with other central banks in the 
United States and Europe. He also said exchange rates should 
properly mirror the economic fundamentals of the countries 
concerned. 
  Hata was on a six-day trip to Europe from Monday for talks 
with leaders in Italy, France, Germany and Belgium.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Defense Agency Director 
General Atsushi Kanda on Monday [9 May] turned back from an 
earlier stance and said he will abide by a longtime 
interpretation by previous governments that the Constitution 
bans the country from being involved in collective security 
arrangements. 
  Kanda told a news conference that the coalition government 
"cannot avoid discussing the Constitution...but I would rather 
say Japan should act in accordance with the current 
constitutional interpretation." 
  Shortly after assuming the post of state minister for 
defense 
late last month, Kanda said Japan needs to apply a more flexible 
interpretation to the Constitution regarding the exercise of 
collective security arrangements. 
  Political sources said Kanda might have withdrawn the 
earlier 
remark out of respect to the No. 2 opposition party, the Social 
Democratic Party, which quit the coalition last month and 
opposed Kanda's proposal to revise the constitutional 
interpretation.

  [Text] Brussels, May 6 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata reiterated Friday that Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano's remarks concerning Japan's role in World War II were 
"inappropriate" and said he regrets that they were made. 
Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Hata, who is on a 
tour of four European nations, said, "the remarks of Justice 
Minister Nagano were not appropriate. I frankly regret... I 
telephoned and reprimanded Justice Minister Nagano." 
  "Justice Minister Nagano said his remarks were inappropriate 
and he would retract them. He said his remarks hurt the 
sentiments of many people and repents," Hata said. 
  "I appointed him (as justice minister) because he is a man 
of 
noble character and has a sense of balance. I would like to 
accept his withdrawal of the remarks and apology seriously," he 
said. 
  Asked whether he will dismiss Nagano from the post, Hata 
said, "I will avoid referring to resignation at this point. 
(The government) is conveying the real intention (of Nagano) to 
various countries and I hope (they) will understand," he said. 
  Nagano said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday 
that 
Japan's role in the war was not aggression and the Nanjing 
massacre was a "fabrication." His remarks triggered an angry 
response from a number of Asian countries and he retracted them 
at a news conference Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano resigned Saturday [7 May] over his remarks that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an 
aggressor in World War II, and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of 
the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. 
  Nagano, a 71-year-old former serviceman who served for only 
10 days as justice minister, submitted his resignation to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, who just returned from a six-day tour of 
four European countries. 
  Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor 
from 
the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition. Nagano is a member of 
Shinseito, a core party of the coalition led by the prime 
minister. 
  Nakai, 51, is a House of Representatives lawmaker and a 
former deputy secretary general of the DSP. 
  Nakai's appointment is scheduled to be attested by Emperor 
Akihito at 10 A.M. Sunday, government sources said. 
  Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his 
"inappropriate remarks" and vowed personal action to show that 
Japan will not start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata. 
  Nagano told Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai earlier 
in the day that he would resign because his comments had caused 
so much turmoil among Japan's international relations. 
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a 
"matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the LDP's 
diplomatic efforts with neighboring nations during its 38-year 
rule which ended last August. 
  Nagano said in an interview published Wednesday in major 
daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "the Nanjing incident was a fabrication." 
  He also said, "I think it is wrong to define the war as a 
war 
of aggression (by Japan) ... Still, I doubt the Greater East 
Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression." 
  Following criticism from China, North and South Korea and 
other Asian countries Japan invaded before and during World War 
II, Nagano retracted his remarks and apologized at a news 
conference Friday. 
  China estimates that imperial Japanese Army troops massacred 
more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of 
the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. But 
Japanese historians tend to give lower estimates -- mostly to 
the order of 100,000. 
  Nagano is the third minister to resign in eight years over 
similar remarks about the war. 
  In September 1986, Masayuki Fujio resigned as education 
minister under the administration of Yasuhiro Nakasone after 
provoking China and Korea with his remarks on Japan's prewar 
actions. 
  Fujio said Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910 was based on 
an agreement between the two countries and justified the 
Japanese act of colonization of the Korean peninsula. He also 
criticized Nakasone for canceling his visit to Yasukuni Shrine, 
which is dedicated to 2.4 million war dead, including A-class 
war criminals. 
  Seisuke Okuno resigned as National Land Agency chief under 
the administration of Noboru Takeshita in May 1988 over his war 
remarks. 
  "Japan fought the war in order to secure its safety ... Asia 
was colonized by Caucasians at that time. Japan was by no means 
a nation of aggression," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Sunday [8 May] admitted his responsibility for the 
resignation of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano over his 
controversial remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a 
fabrication. 
  After he replaced Nagano with Hiroshi Nakai of the 
Democratic 
Socialist Party, Hata told reporters, "As a matter of fact, I am 
responsible (for his resignation) as the person who appointed 
him (as justice minister)." However, he added that he would 
like to show his responsibility by his own actions and efforts 
in preventing a war. 
  Opposition parties are reportedly ready to question his 
responsibility over Nagano's remarks at Diet deliberations which 
start Monday. 
  Hata said he anticipated such Diet deliberations on his 
responsibility, but added, "It is not bad to discuss these 
matters." 
  The premier said it is not fruitless if Diet deliberations 
will help unify a historic view of the Japanese people. 
  The prime minister also said he expects tough Diet going 
because his cabinet started as a minority government. He cited 
an early Diet passage of the government-proposed 1994 draft 
budget as the government's responsibility in the international 
community, considering Japan's current status in the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan informed China, South 
Korea and other Asian nations that Shigeto Nagano retracted his 
earlier statements on Japan's wartime actions and that he has 
resigned as justice minister, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko 
Saito said Monday [9 May]. 
  Saito told a press conference that the Japanese Government 
told the countries on Saturday about the contents of a news 
conference by Nagano in which he retracted earlier remarks that 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. 
  Japan also informed the countries of the contents of a 
separate press conference in Brussels by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata in which the premier said he regretted Nagano's statements, 
he said. 
  Nagano resigned on Saturday. 
  The Japanese Government is currently considering whether 
further diplomatic measures are necessary to cope with criticism 
by Asian nations, Saito said. 
  Saito said that Nagano's remarks were regrettable because it 
may result, even temporarily, in misunderstandings by other 
nations of Japan's position on its wartime activities. 
  Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered a frank 
apology for Japan's wartime aggression last August when he 
assumed the premiership. 
  Nagano said last week that the Nanjing incident was a 
fabrication and that he still thinks it wrong to define the war 
as a war of aggression. His remarks touched off a wave of 
protest from Asian nations.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Komeito leader Koshiro 
Ishida, serving as director general of the Management and 
Coordination Agency, said Monday [9 May] it was "only natural" 
for Shigeto Nagano to have resigned as justice minister over his 
remarks on Japan's wartime aggression. 
  Ishida said in a press conference that Nagano's "extremely 
regrettable" remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never 
happened and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II 
"greatly impacted China and other Asian countries." 
  "So it's only natural that he took responsibility for it," 
he 
said. 
  Nagano, a 71-year-old member of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito and former military serviceman, resigned on Saturday 
after holding the post of justice minister for only 10 days. He 
was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  Ishida suggested that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata undertake 
some kind of political overture vis-a-vis China in order to put 
bilateral relations back on a firm footing. He refuted 
criticism that the Nagano incident reflects the allegedly 
hawkish nature of the Hata cabinet and said that Nagano's remark 
was a personal observation. 
  In a separate press conference, Defense Agency Director 
General Atsushi Kanda said Nagano's remarks were 
"inappropriate," particularly so in light of the fact that it 
has recently become the government's clearly established view 
that Japan waged a war of aggression during World War II.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
spoke to his cabinet ministers Monday [9 May] about the need to 
express to future generations the importance of Japan's remorse 
for its former wartime aggression, government officials said. 
Hata outlined his basic position on Japan's behavior in World 
War II after former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano created an 
uproar last week with his denial of historical facts on Japanese 
aggression, the officials said. 
  "As the head of Shinseito during last year's general 
elections, I expressed (in speeches) my deep remorse and 
convictions over the Japanese military's aggressive behavior and 
colonial rule (in Asia)," Hata told the cabinet meeting. 
"Looking ahead to the 50th anniversary of the end of the war 
next year, we must express to future generations (our remorse)," 
Hata was quoted as saying. 
  On his decision to appoint Nagano as justice minister, Hata 
said that he had asked about his views of the war and got the 
reply that "war must not happen again." 
  When Nagano offered his resignation over his controversial 
remarks, including the charge that the Chinese account of the 
1937 Nanjing massacre is a "fabrication," Hata said he accepted 
the resignation without any special effort to dissuade Nagano. 
  At Monday's cabinet meeting, newly appointed Justice 
Minister 
Hiroshi Nakai greeted the ministers, but did not go on to offer 
his views of the war, the officials said. 
  During an extended Japanese holiday period last week while 
Hata was on a four-nation tour of Europe, the prime minister 
outlined his position on the war and Japanese colonial rule in a 
letter to the cabinet ministers. 
  Borrowing from former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata 
wrote "In the past, the aggressive behavior and colonial rule of 
our nation inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on many 
people. I want to express anew my feelings of deep remorse and 
apology." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said he thought the 
cabinet ministers fully understood Hata's cautionary letter 
regarding Nagano's controversial remarks. 
  Meanwhile, Hata spoke at a ceremony at the Foreign Ministry 
to officially hand over the post of foreign minister to Koji 
Kakizawa, and said he is well aware that Japan's colonial policy 
and actions during World War II inflicted unbearable suffering 
upon neighboring and other Asian nations. 
  The prime minister said he wants to do his best to bring 
peace to the world based on remorse. 
  Hata called Nagano's remarks on Japan's wartime aggression 
very "regrettable" and that it was an "unexpected happening" 
since he personally had trust in Nagano. 
  Nagano resigned over the weekend due to international 
outrage 
over his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened 
and that Japan's invasion of China and other Asian nations was 
not an act of aggression but aimed at liberating these countries 
from colonialism. 
  Hata said that as a Japanese, he feels proud to apologize 
and 
show remorse about the fact that Japan caused pain to other 
nations. He urged Kakizawa to carry out diplomacy aimed at 
bringing peace to the world. 
  Kakizawa told the same ceremony he will carry forward Hata's 
diplomatic policy and work to create a Japan which can be 
trusted and loved by other nations.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
appointed a lower house member Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] as justice minister early Sunday morning, 
replacing Shigeto Nagano for his controversial remarks over the 
1937 Nanjing massacre and Japan's role during World War II. 
  Emperor Akihito is scheduled to attest Nakai's appointment 
at 
10 A.M. Sunday at the Imperial House. 
  Prime Minister Hata explained his views on World War II to 
the new justice minister, saying that Japan's act of aggression 
as well as its colonial rule inflicted great pains on a number 
of people, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. 
Hata asked Nakai to conform to the prime minister's position, 
Kumagai added. 
  At a press conference early Sunday morning, Nakai said, "it 
is an undeniable fact that (the former Japanese Imperial Army) 
conducted cruel acts," when he was asked about the Nanjing 
massacre. 
  Political observers said that Prime Minister Hata apparently 
picked the new justice minister from the DSP in a bid to appease 
mounting criticisms against the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]- 
controlled cabinet in the wake of Nagano's controversial 
remarks. Nagano is a member of Shinseito, a key political party 
of the coalition. 
  The observers added Shinseito intends to show its remorse 
and 
responsibility over party member Nagano's remarks by handing 
over the ministerial post to the DSP. 
  Nagano, 71-year-old former chief of staff of Ground 
Self-Defense Force who served for only 10 days as justice 
minister, submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Hata 
shortly after he returned from a six-day tour of four European 
countries. 
  Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor 
from 
the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition, after about three 
hours of consultations with Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai and 
other members of the cabinet. 
  The 51-year-old Nakai, deputy secretary general of the DSP, 
is the youngest justice minister in postwar Japan. 
  Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his 
remarks and vowed personal action to show that Japan will not 
start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata. At a press 
conference following his resignation, Nagano reiterated his 
apology, saying "(My remarks) caused great shocks and angers 
among peoples in neighboring countries." 
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a 
"matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the diplomatic 
efforts the LDP made to improve ties with neighboring nations as 
the ruling party for 38 years until last August. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party 
[of Japan -- SDPJ], former largest force in the coalition, said 
Nagano's resignation is only natural as it damaged the Japanese 
Government's international integrity. 
  Both the LDP and the SDP are ready to question the Hata 
cabinet over Nagano's war remarks in Diet deliberations slated 
to begin on Monday. Nagano said in an interview published 
Wednesday in the major daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "The Nanjing 
incident was a fabrication." He also said, "I think it is wrong 
to define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)... Still, I 
doubt the Greater East Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was 
aimed at aggression." 
  The remarks immediately drew harsh criticisms from China, 
North and South Korea and other Asian countries, making Nagano 
to retract his remarks and apologize at a news conference Friday. 
  The Nanjing incident refers to the massacre of a great 
number 
of Chinese by the defunct Imperial Japanese Army troops 
following the invasion of the then Chinese capital in December 
1937.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New Justice Minister Hiroshi 
Nakai expressed remorse Monday [9 May] over Japan's aggression 
and colonial rule in the first half of the century. But he 
refrained from criticizing his predecessor Shigeto Nagano, who 
quit over his controversial remarks about the war. "As one of 
the Japanese I must have a feeling of deep remorse and apology 
for the numerous acts of aggression, including colonization," 
Nakai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE at his office 
at the Justice Ministry. 
  Nakai replaced Nagano, who resigned as justice minister 
Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks, which were 
published in a newspaper last Wednesday. He said the 1937 
Nanjing massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with 
China and other countries was not aimed at aggression. 
  "It's correct that the Imperial Japanese Army after invading 
Nanjing at the time massacred ordinary Chinese people," Nakai 
said. 
  Unlike Nagano, who participated in the war with China as an 
army officer, Nakai, born in 1942 in China's Changchun, which 
then belonged to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, was 
still a child at the time the war ended. But as his family was 
repatriated in September 1946, Nakai said he is well aware of 
"the various implications Japan's utter defeat had." 
  Nakai, who was in the middle of a meeting with his election 
committee in Nabari, Mie Prefecture, when Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata called Saturday night to offer him the cabinet post, said 
he accepted out of understanding for "Hata's feelings in this 
very difficult situation." 
  Asked whether he plans to make use of his directional 
authority that allows the justice minister to intervene with the 
prosecution, Nakai said he "does not intend to take action to 
intervene in individual problems." 
  He declined to comment on the ongoing debate about whether 
the United Nations should impose sanctions on North Korea to 
enforce its request for full inspections of the country's 
nuclear facilities, saying he first wants to study relevant 
reports currently being prepared by various government 
institutions. 
  Stressing that the justice minister's duty is to maintain 
law 
and order, Nakai said he does not want to become involved in the 
discussion about the enactment of legislation covering 
emergencies and whether Japan should claim the right to 
collective defense. 
  "It's quite right that everybody voices different views and 
standpoints, and that the Diet and political parties deliberate 
(this problem)...However, I don't want to anticipate this 
discussion," Nakai said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Newly-appointed Justice 
Minister Hiroshi Nakai is known as an advocate of environmental 
problems in the House of Representatives. 
  Nakai, a 51-year-old lower house legislator of the 
Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP), replaced Shigeto Nagano, 71, Saturday 
after Nagano resigned over his remarks denying the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre and Japan's aggressive role in World War II. 
  Nakai has served as the DSP's deputy secretary general and 
as 
chairman of the lower house Committee on Commerce and Industry. 
  Nakai, born in the Chinese northeastern province of Jilin, 
was elected to the lower house for the first time in 1976 and 
has since been reelected six times from the No. 1 constituency 
of Mie Prefecture. Before embarking on his career as a 
politician, Nakai worked as a secretary for his father who was a 
lower house legislator of the Social Democratic Party.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), whose pullout has plunged the coalition government into a 
minority, will seek parliamentary cooperation with the new party 
Sakigake [Harbinger], a top SDP official said Monday [9 May]. 
  SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama will visit the headquarters 
of 
Sakigake Tuesday for talks with Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura in a bid to create a political alliance, the official 
said. 
  The SDP wants to secure Takemura's consent to form a joint 
parliamentary group between the two in a bid to confront the 
fragile minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
political sources said. 
  The move, if materialized, might trigger a fresh momentum to 
start a "second reconfiguration of the political community" by 
motivating some Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rebels to join 
their prospective alliance, they said. 
  The SDP has been seeking to bring about a convergence of 
social democrat forces and liberal political forces. 
  However, Takemura may face some intraparty resistance to the 
proposed merger with the SDP, as its 15 House of Representatives 
legislators are former defectors from the conservative LDP that 
has strongly upheld the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the sources 
said. 
  The policy stand of the LDP breakaway also clashes with 
other 
aspects of the socialists, who have called for a scaling down of 
the Self-Defense Forces and balked at the proposed expansion of 
Japan's dependence on nuclear power generation, the sources said. 
  The SDP stormed out of the coalition on April 26 after it 
was 
infuriated by the sudden formation of a 130-member parliamentary 
bloc comprising conservative coalition parties in the lower 
house following a bitter policy row within the coalition. 
  The SDP has stood up to the Shinseito-led conservative 
mainstream in the coalition, which has called for a hike in the 
consumption tax and close security cooperation with the U.S. 
Forces to deal with a possible contingency on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The SDP's Murayama earlier suggested that close cooperation 
with Sakigake would help alleviate the voter perception of the 
party as a left-leaning ideological hard-liner, saying, 
"cooperation with Sakigake will change the image of the SDP."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New party Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the group Seiun launched a unified 18-legislator 
parliamentary group in the House of Representatives on Monday [9 
May], party officials said. 
  Sakigake, the 15-legislator party, is headed by former Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura in the preceding coalition 
government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who lead 
his 37-member Japan New Party. 
  The three-legislator Seiun, a breakaway from the JNP, 
splintered after Hosokawa reneged on his promise to merge with 
Sakigake. Now, the new parliamentary bloc has emerged as the 
fifth largest parliamentary group in the lower house after the 
206-member Liberal Democratic Party, the 130-member Kaishin 
(Innovation), the 74-member Social Democratic Party and the 
52-legislator Komeito. 
  Takemura distanced his party from the coalition after 
Hosokawa decided to side with the chief coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa, who is credited with sweeping his ally Tsutomu 
Hata to prime ministership in a policy reconciliation talk that 
led up to the April 25 Diet vote. 
  Ozawa and Takemura have confronted each other over the 
wisdom 
of proposals to expand Japan's parts [as received] in UN 
peacekeeping missions, hike the rate of the consumption tax, and 
taking a tougher line over the suspected North Korean nuclear 
arms program.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The head of Japan's No. 2 
opposition party pledged Monday [9 May] to cooperate with the 
largest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
against what he called the coalition's high-handed management of 
state affairs. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ] (SDP), said at a meeting of 
delegates from the SDP's prrefectural chapters that the party 
will flexibly join forces with the LDP to combat "power-oriented 
politics." 
  The SDP chairman also vowed to put the party on alert for a 
"battle" that could come at any time since Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata faces a heap of issues that demand a clear mandate 
of the people. His remarks were viewed by some political 
pundits as a signal that the SDP is looking for an early general 
election for the House of Representatives because Hata's 
minority government is in a very precarious position. 
  The SDP broke ranks with the ruling coalition immediately 
after the party helped put Hata in office. The split came in a 
feud when the coalition's majority forces led the core party 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] due to their move to create a 
large parliamentary bloc excluding the SDP. 
  The SDP, which had constituted the largest component of the 
coalition, criticized Hata's Shinseito and its closest ally 
Komeito for their "forceful" handling of Diet business. The 
SDP's walkout left Hata's coalition with a minority in the lower 
house. 
  If the SDP and its former archrival LDP enter into alliance, 
they could easily put the Hata administration in a corner by, 
for instance, passing a no-confidence motion. In that case, 
Hata will have to call a snap election or resign with his 
ministers. 
  Murayama's remarks also appear to reflect the widening rift 
between his party and the coalition over key political issues, 
in particular over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
program and Japan's tax reform plans. 
  The SDP is leery of growing signs that the coalition might 
take a hard-line stance against Pyongyang, with even a 
possibility of sending Self-Defense Forces members overseas to 
join an international blockade. 
  On the tax issue, Hata and his powerful behind-the-scenes 
partner Ichiro Ozawa want to raise the 3-percent consumption tax 
to fund proposed income tax cuts and set aside funds to support 
an aging society. But for many SDP policy makers, raising the 
consumption tax is still an anathema because they fiercely 
opposed the introduction of the value-added tax. 
  Murayama recently said the consumption tax should be 
abolished as part of sweeping tax reform to realize a better 
balance in taxation on income, consumption and assets.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) Monday [9 May] 
called for a Diet testimony by former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa over a loan he received from a trucking company, 
resulting in a scandal that toppled him from office. The two 
parties made the demand at a preparatory meeting of the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee, claiming Hosokawa conceded 
that remarks he made before the Diet and the documents he 
presented concerning the loan included falsehood. 
  The LDP and the JCP also requested that three other persons, 
including Hosokawa's Secretary Namio Yatsuka, be summoned to the 
committee as witnesses over Hosokawa's shady fund management. 
  The 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed from Sagawa Kyubin 
Co., 
a scandal-ridden trucking company, in 1982 created a Diet 
stalemate which led to his resignation last month. Hosokawa 
admitted in a press conference when he announced his resignation 
that he received the interest on the loan as a political 
contribution, partly revising his previous account that he had 
fully repaid the loan with interest. 
  In connection with the fund management problem, Hosokawa's 
secretary said last month that his private office had failed to 
report investment profits of 29 million yen to tax authorities. 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, however, hinted at a 
press conference Monday [9 May] that the ruling coalition is not 
enthusiastic about summoning Hosokawa before the Diet. 
  An executives' meeting of the upper house's budget committee 
later decided to summon financial consultant Shuzo Fujiki before 
the committee Wednesday as a witness in Hosokawa's alleged 
involvement in the 1986 purchase of shares in telecommunications 
giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
  The committee will formalize the decision in a meeting 
Tuesday. 
  Hosokawa has denied he was personally involved in the 
transaction, saying the deal was conducted by his late 
father-in-aw, although he has admitted he provided collateral 
for a loan from a stock investment firm to finance the purchase. 
  Opposition lawmakers claim Hosokawa used his position as a 
regional governor to secure the loan under favorable conditions. 
  Fujiki has said at a press conference he arranged the loan 
for Hosokawa and that it was his own deal. 
  The opposition camp apparently hopes Fujiki's testimony will 
force the ruling coalition to allow Hosokawa himself to be 
called before the committee and eventually force the former 
premier to resign as a member of the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Sumitomo Heavy Industries 
Ltd. allegedly paid 140 million yen to the president of an 
Osaka-based rightist organization as a fee for settling the 
company's trouble with another rightist group over the 
construction of an incinerator, industry sources said Monday [9 
May]. 
  The sources said the major shipbuilder in the Sumitomo 
conglomerate made a consultant contract with a company run by 
the head of the rightist group in Osaka Prefecture, after the 
shipbuilder won a contract last August to build the incinerator 
in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture. The company paid 140 million 
yen into the account of the company run by the rightist under 
the name of a consultation fee, the sources said. 
  Rumors of bid-rigging surrounded the incinerator project and 
another rightist group had criticized the bid from a truck 
equipped with loudspeakers near Tsukuba's City Hall and at the 
mayor's house in late November last year, just before the 
ceremony to begin building the incinerator. 
  The president of the rightist group which made the 
consultant 
contract with Sumitomo Heavy Industries requested the other 
rightist group to stop its criticisms at that time, according to 
the sources. 
  A public relations official of Sumitomo Heavy Industries 
refused to comment on the allegations.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry says it believes that ties 
between Singapore and the United States are robust enough to 
weather any difficulties caused by Michael Fay's caning. A 
Ministry spokesman says he hopes both sides would focus on their 
larger mutual interests and put this incident behind them. He 
said the United States and Singapore have always enjoyed the 
strong relationship based on many common interests and shared 
strategic objectives. The spokesman said it would be 
regrettable if the action of one individual who transgressed 
Singapore law and had been punished according to the law were 
allowed to affect bilateral relations. 
  The spokesman was responding to a statement by the acting 
spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Christine Shell. The 
statement was issued after a meeting between Assistant Secretary 
of State Winston Lord and Singapore Ambassador S.R. Nathan. The 
statement noted Mr. Lord said the incident would have to be 
taken into account in the overall relationship between the U.S. 
and Singapore.

Goh Chok Tong said the decision has been taken, Fay has been 
caned, the matter will be left behind us. He believed 
Singapore-U.S. relations are robust enough to withstand whatever 
action the U.S. may take against Singapore. 
  Mr. Goh said the reaction of Singaporeans was not 
unexpected. 
He noted it was a rebuff attitude because Singaporeans believe 
in caning as a deterrent. He was responding to questions raised 
by reporters at the istana [palace] garden party this evening.

<F P=106> [by Mervin Nambiar] </F>
  [Text] SINGAPORE, May 7 (AFP) -- Singapore Saturday 
summoned US envoy Ralph Boyce to the foreign office to express 
displeasure over false reports on American teenager Michael Fay 
caned here for vandalism, a government spokesman said. 
  The spokesman said that the government was unhappy over a 
news agency report quoting Fay's father, George Fay and his 
American lawyer, Theodore Simon, as saying that the caning 
ripped Fay's buttocks and left him in continual pain. 
  Both men, speaking in the United States, had reportedly 
quoted US Vice-Consul John Coe who visited Michael Fay on 
Friday, a day after he received four lashes on his buttocks, in 
their accounts of the teenager's condition after the beating. 
  Fay, 18, from Kettering, Ohio, who lives here with his 
mother 
and step-father had pleaded guilty to charges of spray-painting 
cars, pelting them with eggs and keeping stolen road signs. But 
he later claimed he was innocent. 
  Boyce, the American Charge d'Affairs here, and Coe, who were 
both called to the foreign office, were not availabe for comment. 
  Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Kishore Mahbubani said 
that the US embassy had the moral obligation to confirm or deny 
the report. 
  The ministry thought that the true picture would come out 
when it allowed Coe to see Fay but instead was "shocked by the 
tremendous amount of falsification," the Singapore Broadcasting 
Corporation quoted Mahbubani as saying. 
  Coe was the only American to see Michael Fay after the 
caning 
on Thursday. 
  Coe did not speak to the press after the prison visit but 
briefed the teenager's mother, Randay Chan who later denounced 
the beating as "torture." 
  Chan said that the consular officer was not able to assess 
her son's condition because the meeting took place "in a 
controlled situation" with prison officials present. 
  Singapore's Prisons Department earlier Saturday called 
statements attributed to George Fay and Simon "wild allegations 
and misinformation," adding that Michael Fay walked back to his 
cell after the caning, saying he "wanted to act like a man." 
  The spokesman said that the list of "misinformation" 
attributed to Simon included the claim that blood ran down the 
teenager's legs during the caning. 
  He said that while there were a few drops of blood on Fay's 
buttocks, "blood did not run down his legs" during the caning. 
  "He sat on a chair shortly after the interview started and 
remained seated throughout the rest of the interview," the 
spokesman said. George Fay had reportedly said that his son 
stood throughout the meeting with Coe 
  Fay also told Coe to tell his mother "not to worry" and tell 
his father to "shut up," the spokesman said, adding: "The cane 
marks are almost dry and clean." 
  Fay was ordered caned six times, but the Singapore 
government 
reduced the sentence to four lashes after President Bill Clinton 
intervened. 
  Clinton has called the punishment a "mistake" and the State 
Department called in Singapore's ambassador to the United 
States, S.R. @athan, and told him that Washington was 
disappointed by the affair. 
  Meanwhile 17-year-old Shiu Chi Ho, a Hong Kong national also 
convicted of vandalism, spent his first full day in prison 
Saturday after abandoning plans to take his case to a higher 
court. 
  Shiu, sentenced to 12 lashes and eight months jail for 
spray-painting four cars over two weekends, will write to 
President Ong for clemency, his father, Shiu Chung On said. 
  He is not expected to be caned until after the government 
decides on the petition, lawyers said.

  [Text] The Prisons Department says American teenager 
Michael Fay is in good condition and the cane marks on him are 
clean and almost dried. Fay was caned four times on Thursday for 
vandalism. 
  In a statement today, the Prisons Department said Fay walked 
back on his own to his cell after the caning, saying that he 
wanted to act like a man. He shook the caner's hand and smiled 
when he went back to his cell. 
  The department gave this account in response to allegations 
made by Fay's father and lawyer reported by REUTERS News Agency. 
Both George Fay and the lawyer, Theodore Simon, created an 
account given to them by a U.S. consular official who visited 
Michael Fay at Queenstown Remand Prison yesterday. 
  Mr. Fay was quoted as saying that his son stood throughout 
the 45 minutes meeting, and an official removed his bandages. 
  Mr. Simon said that during the caning, blood ran down Fay's 
legs. He said Fay was in the prison hospital ward. But the 
Prisons Department said blood did not run down his legs although 
there were a few drops on his buttocks during the caning. 
  Fay has also been in his prison cell throughout. He was not 
bandaged and during the meeting he lifted a dressing [Word 
indistinct] himself. 
  Fay told the consular official that although the caning cut 
his skin, it was not as bad and horrifying as described in the 
press. He asked the official to tell his mother not to worry 
that he is fine and would not do stupid things to himself. Fay 
also asked the official to tell his father to "shut up". He 
repeated this request towards the end of the meeting during 
which he was quite cheerful and in good spirits. 
  The Amercian official, Mr. John Coe, who met Michael Fay 
yesterday could not be reached for comment. 
  A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also confirmed that 
the ministry had summoned the U.S. counselor, Mr. Ralph Boyce 
and consular official Mr. John Coe to express Singapore's 
displeasure over the false report carried by REUTERS News Agency 
quoting a U.S. diplomat and U.S. consular official.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fay Case: Note the Disquiet"] </F>
  [Text] Based on calls to our offices and a limited street 
sampling, the gut feeling of a fair number of Singaporeans about 
the Michael Fay conclusion seems to be regret that reducing the 
number of caning strokes from six to four was giving in to 
American pressure, regardless of how the Government explains 
geopolitical realities. Most people, it is noted, accept the 
rationale implied in the president's response to the clemency 
appeal. But the government must acknowledge that this view is 
liable to gain currency: the United States government wanted 
nothing less than commutation, which rightly was a non-starter 
where Singapore was concerned, so why the need to compromise? 
In wanting to meet President Bill Clinton part of the way, as 
the government says, it has dismayed a section of Singaporean 
opinion which holds that the authorities should have stuck it 
out as it has the commanding heights in moralism and 
jurisdictional rights. Neither could it mollify Washington and 
the merchants of hysteria and disinformation in the American 
liberal establishment, whose campaign against Singapore has been 
asking that the basis of its penology be scrapped as it does not 
conform to American values. That said, this was, still, 
arguably the least controversial approach to a troublesome 
episode. There are a number of reasons. 
  The first, which is crucial as it bears directly on the rule 
of law, is that a legal principle had not been subverted. Fay 
was sentenced to be caned because he had vandalised property. 
He received swift justice yesterday. The Americans offended 
Singaporean sensibilities when they moved heaven and earth to 
save his skin but Fay was not spared the punishment; reducing 
the number of strokes fell within the realm of constitutional 
discretion. This reinforces the message the government has been 
consistent about since the case broke, which is that the law is 
inviolate and nationality-blind. Would foreigners please note. 
  A second factor has to do with balancing domestic political 
realities with the conduct of foreign relations. Not caning Fay 
would not just have made a mockery of the law, it would injure 
the Government's mandate in managing the state. Preserving the 
integrity of the judicial system, then, is the fount of the 
moral right to ruIe. A dogged adherence to this position could, 
however, expose the government to charges of being not 
sufficiently mindful of external factors in a world rendered 
interdependent by trade, security and diplomatic obligations. 
That is the substance of the government's concession. Much 
play is made in the official statement of the good relations 
with the US and of its economic and security contributions to 
Asia-Pacific stability. To those in favour of giving the 
Americans some latitude, taking into account the special 
relations between the two countries, the justification would 
make more palatable an uncharacteristic pliability. But this 
would barely pass muster with those Singaporeans who are either 
incensed by gorilla heaviness of some American media advocates 
whose chutzpah they see as exceeded only by their ignorance, or 
view the trade and diplomatic angle as irrelevant to a judicial 
matter. 
  In the end, this has been a case of exercising political 
judgment. Time will tell if the government had acted correctly. 
For now it would have to take note of the unhappiness expressed 
by concerned Singaporeans who had backed it fully in taking the 
hard line, not out of jingoism but on a point of principle. But 
more troubling is the opening its decision would provide for 
special interests and foreign governments to intercede on behalf 
of their nationals in controversial cases in the future, or 
cases with "media possibilities". The government says this is 
"an exceptional decision which will not be a precedent for 
future cases". The commitment is one which Singaporeans will 
expect it to uphold -- come hell or high water.

  [Text] The NTUC [National Trade Union Congress] Voice 
Cooperative Society has entered into a joint venture with CUE 
Network Corp. of the U.S. to launch an international paging 
service in Singapore in about six months' time. 
  Called CUE SE Asia, the venture has an authorised capital of 
$1 million [Singapore dollars], said Choo Wee Khiang, chairman 
of NTUC Voice and an MP for Jalan Besar GRC [Group 
Representatives Committee], yesterday. 
  The company will develop the use of FM subcarriers already 
present with the two frequencies FM 100.3 and FM 91.3 used by 
NTUC Radio Heart. FM subcarriers are the sidebands that 
separate various radio frequencies and are largely unused. 
  Cue SE Asia will make use of FM radio stations around the 
world that are signed on the CUE network to transmit paging 
signals internationally. 
  Subscribers to the service can choose the countries with 
which they want to be linked. Subscribers can be contacted in 
North America, Canada, China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Right 
now, there are about 100,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. 
Subscriber numbers in Southeast Asia are expected to hit the 
same figure. Subscription rates have yet to be worked out. 
  Negotiations are under way with other countries in the 
region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the 
Philippines, and Vietnam to be hooked up on the network in one 
to two years, and NTUC Voice and CUE intend to make Singapore 
the service hub of the region. 
  The international paging will work only with pagers 
developed 
by CUE. These will be available in the market soon and are 
expected to retail at U.S. $190, the price at which they are 
sold in the U.S. 
  As only Telecom can provide paging services locally until 
1997, negotiations are under way for CUE SE Asia to operate the 
service locally. 
  In the meantime, a satellite dish will be set up nearby, 
possibly on Batam, to receive and transmit signals 
internationally. If talks with Telecom do not come through, the 
pagers will only be for international messages and not local 
signals. 
  Besides the international paging service, CUE SE Asia will 
offer other telecommunications services, the most significant of 
which is the differential global positioning satellites or DGPS 
service. 
  This uses the same FM sidebands as the international paging 
service for the transmission of differential correction 
information. This is useful for work that involves the 
pinpointing of accurate locations -- navigation for instance. 
Talks are already under way with NTUC Comfort. 
  DGPS can record the location of a vehicle and broadcast it 
back to a despatch centre. The equipment required to receive 
and transmit DGPS is simply a special piece of software that is 
attached to the CUE pager's docking platform. 
  Mr. Choo said this use of the FM sidebands makes sound 
commercial sense.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Who Is Opposing the King's National </F>
Reconciliation Policy and Further Inflaming the Vietnamese War 
of Aggression?"] 
  [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk has proposed a roundtable 
meeting since early 1993, after the injudicious elections 
organized by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] 
concluded. The aim of this is to reconcile the nation and put 
an end to the Vietnamese war of aggression, thereby restoring 
peace, independence, national unity, and territorial integrity. 
  Democratic Kampuchea and the entire Cambodian nation and 
people have supported the king's initiative and have undertaken 
all kinds of activities to speed up the call for the roundtable 
meeting with a view to quickly ending the sufferings of our 
nation and people. Nonetheless, the communist Vietnamese puppets 
and the two-headed government, abiding by the advice of the 
communist Vietnamese and their alliance, have persistently 
opposed the king's initiative. At this present time they are 
continuing their opposition to the roundtable. They have 
impudently said that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge must be 
brought about by guns and that the Khmer Rouge should be smashed 
to pieces. 
  [Words indistinct] the communist Vietnamese puppets and two- 
headed government were very busy buying armaments, ammunition, 
tanks, and cannons for the purpose of launching offensive 
attacks on Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people. They 
launched an audacious attack on Stoung and Phnum Chhat in August 
1993. Afterward, they attacked Anlung Veng and Pailin in the 
most brutal and barbarous manner. During their attacks, they 
indiscriminately massacred our people. They also plundered and 
completely destroyed houses, property, and farms that had taken 
our people several years to build in difficult conditions. 
Hundreds of thousands of people, with their children, run away 
from their houses and villages to escape from the criminal 
activities of those bandits. The two-headed government, the 
communist Vietnamese, and the alliance, which is their master, 
declared that those criminal activities were their great 
victories. They claimed they had destroyed the Khmer Rouge at 
this or that area and had occupied and captured this or that 
Khmer Rouge position, and so on. 
  The aforementioned events have been given very wide coverage 
both nationally and internationally. It is the communist 
Vietnamese puppets, the two-headed government, the communist 
Vietnamese, and their alliance which have opposed the king's 
national reconciliation plan and further inflamed the Vietnamese 
war of aggression. At present, our Cambodian people are 
denouncing them and jointly attacking them everywhere. This is 
to force them to accept the king's five-point national 
reconciliation plan.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 9 May (AKP) -- His Majesty Norodom 
Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, on 7 May made a clarification on the 
two solutions he had proposed to put an end to the civil war in 
Cambodia. Following is the text of the clarification: 
  "Yesterday, 6 May, I said among other things that one of the 
following two solutions might be brought to the tragic problem 
of the very harmful civil war between the Cambodian Royal Army 
[CRA] and the NADK [National Army of Democratic Kampuchea] -- 
the Khmer Rouge: 
  Solution A: New elections with the participation of the PDK 
[Party of Democratic Kampuchea] as a political party -- 
following a total and lasting cease-fire, with "standstill". 
  At the end of these elections -- which I, Norodom Sihanouk, 
would be responsible for organizing and supervising -- the PDK 
would probably win seats within our National Assembly, besides 
the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], the CPP [Cambodian 
People's Party], the BLDP [Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party], 
and so on. The PDK would thereby be reintegrated into the 
national community within the framework of our pluralist liberal 
democracy. 
  Solution B: The PDK transfers to the government all its 
"autonomous" zones and dissolves the NADK. 
  The government and National Assembly modify a small part of 
our present Constitution to allow "acceptable" PDK personalities 
to join the government and royal administration while 
"acceptable" NADK elements are integrated into the Army. 
  "Of course, there is no question of me imposing either 
solution on the government and National Assembly. These are 
merely "ideas" to be considered or not by either warring party."

<F P=106> [Address by King Norodom Sihanouk at the opening of the </F>
third national congress of Buddhist monks held in Phnom Penh on 
6 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Today, I should dare to make 
the following arbitration. 
  They [Khmer Rouge] [KR] must now stop fighting. Since they 
have claimed to be the people's representatives, they should not 
be afraid of the election. If they dare to take part in a 
democratic election, I dare to ask Samdech Ranariddh, Samdech 
Hun Sen, Samdech Chea Sim, and Samdech Son Sann to agree to a 
new election. The pevious election was claimed to be 
incorrectly held because it was organized by the UNTAC [UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia], by the foreigners. They 
said that. Now, we propose that a new election be held with 
Sihanouk overseeing it. [applause]. Sihanouk will supervise it. 
I would like to take this occasion to inform venerable monks of 
this message. That is, Sihanouk will supervise and rearrange 
(?with his neutral attitude) an election. They should be happy 
with all the seats that they will get. Supposing that they can 
get 50 seats, they will be able to control a large portion of 
the power. Fifty seats will be a large portion. If they get 70 
seats, they will be very strong. If they get 80 seats, they 
will be able to do anything they like. Therefore, they should 
agree. 
  Speaking before the venerable monks at this third congress 
of 
Buddhist monks, we are not joking. Let us hold another election 
since they said the previous one was organized by the 
foreigners, the UNTAC. Now, it will be held by Sihanouk whom 
they recognize as their king. They have not yet rejected 
Sihanouk. They said they only reject Samdech Ranariddh, His 
Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, and Samdech Chea Sim. They do not 
reject Sihanouk. Now, Sihanouk is willing, (?at this age), to 
chair, to organize it. Sihanouk will go to all provinces to see 
that the election is held correctly. Whoever will win or lose, 
we will control the power in line with the laws and 
Constitution. [Words indistinct] they must have heard about 
this now because they have informants. They always hear about 
everything we say. They are very smart. They have informants. 
They always hear about everything at once. 
  Now, I would like to make this appeal that venerable monks 
have also expressed their welcome just now. Now, if Samdechs 
Ranariddh, Hun Sen, and Chea Sim have the spirit of 
sportsmanship, of a so-called [preceding word in French] 
sportsman, they should agree if the Khmer Rouge [KR] stop 
fighting. Everyone should observe a standstill wherever he is. 
They should be anywhere they are and stop oppressing, stop 
killing the others. 
  We should play the game correctly. We should play the sport 
correctly. That is, we should play the game of genuine 
democracy by holding the election, the general election in all 
provinces. We should hold the election again (?with all parties 
taking part). [passage omitted] 
  On this occasion, they should think whether to agree, to 
accept a reelection or they accept my other formula that they 
should return all of their autonomus regions and then dissolve 
their army, not 100 percent, [changes thought] to integrate it 
into the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] like the armies of H.E. 
Son Sann, H.E. Sak Sutsakhan, Samdech Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun 
Sen which are now KRAF, and then they themselves join the Royal 
Government to share the power. However, some have said that the 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independence, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] or the Cambodian People's 
Party disagreed. They said that it would be against the 
Constitution for them to join the government. Even if the 
constitution is amended, we can still refuse to accept them. In 
the Sangkum Reas Niyum, not only those elected party members 
were made ministers. The outsiders, such as experts, were 
appointed ministers. The Constitution in that era did not 
prohibit this. That was done to achieve peace, to eliminate the 
impasse, the autonomous state. 
  If the Khmer Rouge agree to negotiate with this side, if 
this 
side kindly agrees to accept them into the government, there 
will certainly be a way out. There will be a way out, but we 
have continued to say no. Not only saying no and refusing to 
allow them to join the government, but we have even (?rejected) 
them through legal means by drafting a law declaring the Khmer 
Rouge as the outlaws. By so doing, they will become even more 
cruel. 
  At present, can we prevent them from entering the villages 
and communes that belong to the FUNCINPEC and to the front of 
H.E. Sak Sutsakhan to slash the throats of women there; can we 
protect our people? Since we cannot protect our people, we 
should agree to form a coalition with the Khmer Rouge. It does 
not mean that we must agree with it unconditionally. We will 
agree to do so only when the Khmer Rouge stop fighting, stop 
killing, and stop having an army. They should intergrate their 
army into the KRAF so that there will be only one army. Our 
government will be a government of peace and national 
reconciliation by including them in it. With that statement, I 
was accused of desiring to help the Khmer Rouge. It is not that 
I want to help the Khmer Rouge. I would not dare to lie before 
the venerable monks here. Samdech Sihanouk only wants peace for 
the nation. That is all. [passsage omitted] 
  Now there are these two options. Should we hold another 
election, or should we refrain from the reelection and turn to 
reconciliation by accepting the Khmer Rouge in the government 
and their army in the KRAF? But will they agree with it? If 
they disagree, national history (?will punish them). As for us, 
we must now calculate what is right or wrong so that if 
children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren suffer any loss of 
life again, we will know clearly who are the wrongdoers.

  [Text] His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of 
Cambodia, has said that the Khmer Rouge should surrender to the 
Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] the regions they control, 
dissolve all their armed forces, and join the RGC and the Khmer 
Royal Armed Forces through an amendment of the Constitution. 
This is a solution. Another is the reorganization of elections. 
  His Majesty stated this in his 7 May clarification letter. 
The king added that the two solutions are just his own 
suggestions and that he has not asked the government or the 
National Assembly to adopt or implement them.

  [Text] Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is reasonably 
satisfied with the outcome of the talks he held in Geneva with 
Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso on the future of East 
Timor. In an exclusive interview with Rui Araujo, Ali Alatas 
talks about progress but does not stop at criticizing Portugal 
and particularly the adoption of the so-called confidence 
building measures. 
  [Begin recording] [Rui Araujo] Are you happy with the 
results 
of the meeting? 
  [Alatas, in English with superimposed Portuguese 
translation] 
Reasonably happy because, we, again, made some progress in 
identifying and agreeing on some confidence building measures. 
  [Rui Araujo] Some will argue that the talks, until now, have 
achieved little if anything substantive. 
  [Alatas] No, it is true that we have not reached the 
substantive part of the talks yet, as was earlier agreed upon 
among the three sides [Portugal, UN and Indonesia]. We first 
tried to create a better atmosphere, a propitious atmosphere, 
before we go into the substance because we know that the two 
positions, the two basic positions are very far apart. So we 
have made progress with these confidence building measures. It 
was slow, not as fast as I would have liked, but we are making 
progress. You should see it from that point of view, rather 
that from the point of view of substance that we have not 
reached yet. 
  [Rui Araujo] Are you optimistic about that issue? 
  [Alatas] I would say I am reasonably satisfied with the pace 
of the talks. 
  [Rui Araujo] You have accused Portugal of failing to act 
quickly to establish confidence building measures. What kind of 
measures were you expecting from Portugal? 
  [Alatas] Just as a few illustrations, perhaps: when we 
started talking about confidence building measures at the 
beginning, we could not agree at all on any one of them and, if 
my recollection is correct, we agreed immediately at the first 
meeting already on something like exclusion of journalists, 
exclusion of personalities, etc. It took two meetings before 
Portugal came around to accept it. There were other things that 
were already proposed by the secretary- general from the very 
beginning, such as interest sections. You have heard about this 
proposal that we would not open diplomatic relations because 
that may be too early perhaps for Portugal, but interest 
sections, two officers, two diplomatic officers of Portugal in 
the Netherlands and two Indonesian officers in the Thai embassy 
or the Malaysian embassy in Portugal. They would quietly work 
there, they would be a channel of communications. 
  In the case of the Portuguese diplomats, they can 
occasionally go to East Timor, report on what they themselves 
see rather than rely solely on the press. These are some of the 
good confidence building measures. 
  [Araujo] Do you feel Portugal is changing now? 
  [Alatas] I see no indication yet on that. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Finance Mari'e 
Muhammad said here yesterday that the government will continue 
to restrict the inflow of offshore commercial loans to avoid 
worsening the country's debt-service ratio. 
  The private sector should minimize the domestic financial 
sources to finance their investment projects, the minister said, 
adding that the private sector should avoid using offshore loans 
despite their growing role in the country's development efforts. 
  "The strict control of offshore borrowing is essential, not 
only to maintain the level of the balance of payments at a 
comfortable level, but also to reduce the debt burden, the 
minister said at a seminar on strategic financing sources. 
  Bank Indonesia [Central Bank] Governor J. Sudrajad 
Jiwandono, 
president of the state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) 
[Indonesian State Bank], Winarto Sumarto and chairman of Merril 
Lynch Limited for the Asia and Pacific Region, Peter Clarke, 
were among the speakers at the seminar held by the EDITOR weekly 
magazine. 
  Mar'ie promised to further address the country's non-bank 
financial sources to enable the private sector to benefit from 
the government's massive infrastructure projects in the 
1994-1999 sixth Five-year Development Plan (Repelita VI) period. 
  The capital market should be further developed to give the 
private sector better alternatives for raising investment funds, 
he said. 
  Indonesia should invest at least Rp [Rupiah] 660 trillion 
(US$314 billion) to sustain economic growth in the current five 
year development plan. The private sector is expected to 
contribute around 37 percent of that figure. 
  The Central Bank governor shared the finance minister's view 
on the need of the private sector to enter the capital market to 
obtain investment funds. 
  "I think the capital market is the best financing 
alternative 
at present," Sudrajad said, adding that domestic banks are also 
a good financing alternative, but the available funds in the 
banks are not sufficient to meet the huge investment demand. 
  He said the private sector should use local financial 
sources, as raising commercial loans from overseas will still be 
restricted in order to reduce the country's debt burden. 
  Sudrajad said the country's debt-service ratio is expected 
to 
decline to 20 percent by the end of the Repelita VI period in 
1999 from around 32 percent at present. 
  He said the government will also continue to improve the 
investment climate to further attract foreign investments. 
"Foreign direct investment is one of important financial 
alternatives for development in the next five years," he said. 
  In another development, the finance minister dismissed 
reports of a rush to buy dollars [US] based on rumors of the 
government's plan to devalue the rupiah. [Passage omitted 
covered by referent item]

  [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--Ginandjar 
Kartasasmita, minister of state for national planning and 
development/chairman of BAPPENAS [National Development Planning 
Board], said that, to overcome shortages of funds and to improve 
efficiency, the Indonesian Government will expand privatization 
in various sectors in the next REPELITA [Five-Year Development 
Plan]. 
  In reply to a question from World Bank President Louis T. 
Preston in a meeting at the BAPPENAS office yesterday, Ginandjar 
said that privatization efforts in Indonesia need to be expanded 
in various sectors. The objective is not only greater efficiency 
but also to overcome the government's ever worsening shortages 
of development funds. 
  According to Ginandjar, privatization has started in the 
electricity sector. In the future, privatization will be 
expanded to a number of other sectors including the 
communications (toll roads, railroads, and ports) and 
infrastructure sectors (telecommunications and drinking water). 
  Ginandjar acknowledged that development funds will be more 
limited in the future. The private sector's role in 
infrastructural projects, therefore, will be expanded, 
particularly in East Indonesia. 
  A matter more important than privatization is efficiency 
issue, Ginandjar continued. Efficiency can be achieved by 
promoting competition among private sector managers and 
companies as well as among state-owned enterprises. 
<H5>  Ministers </H5>
  In his meeting with the World Bank president and his deputy, 
Gautam S. Kaji, BAPPENAS Chairman Ginandjar Kartasasmita was 
accompanied by ministers who handle development of 
infrastructure and human resources, namely Minister of Education 
and Culture Wardiman Djojonegoro; Minister of Tourism, Post, and 
Telecommunications Joop Ave; Minister of Communications Haryanto 
Dhanutirto; Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar; and 
Minister of Health Sujudi. 
  Ginandjar told reporters that the meeting was absolutely not 
for discussion of the size of the loan to be given by the World 
Bank in the next fiscal year but was merely for a dialogue on 
the expansion of Indonesian development. 
  According to Ginandjar, loan assistance from the World Bank 
for fiscal 1994-95 in the framework of the CGI will not be 
discussed until after the Indonesian Government has finished 
drafting its funding priorities for development projects for 
that fiscal year. 
  Ginandjar said the Indonesian Government will continue to 
take advantage of opportunities for loan assistance from Bank 
Indonesia [as published] as well as from other international 
financial institutions. He denied that such loan assistance will 
reduce government efforts to achieve national self-sufficiency. 
  "Self-sufficiency absolutely does not mean that we will then 
not want to accept loan assistance. If low-interest loan 
assistance is available, why should we not take advantage of 
it?" Ginandjar said to reporters. The World Bank provided loan 
assistance totaling $1.6 billion in the CGI framework in 1993-94.

  [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets 
conducted a war exercise for a Northward invasion and aerial 
espionage. 
  According to military sources, on 6 May, the U.S. 
imperialists dragged squadrons of fighter planes from its 
overseas bases into the skies above South Korea and conducted 
again a provocative aerial war exercise for a Northward invasion. 
  That day, the squadrons of fighter bombers and 
pursuit-assault planes that moved out from U.S. bases in the 
Pacific area to the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Taejon, and 
Yechon frantically waged a surprise attack exercise against 
strategic targets in the Northern half of the Republic. 
  Mobilized to this war exercise were those airplane squadrons 
from overseas bases and some 180 various fighter bombers, 
assault planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes of 
the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea and of the puppet 
Air Force. 
  This frantic war exercise under the command of E-3 airborne 
warning and control planes that flew from a base in Okinawa, 
Japan was aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of 
cooperation among airplane squadrons from overseas bases, the 
U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea, and the puppet Air 
Force; and examining their capability of making a surprise 
attack for a Northward invasion. 
  On the same day, An RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane 
flew 
from an overseas base into the skies above the area near the DMZ 
and then carried out electronic reconnaissance on strategic 
points in the northern half of the Republic while flying at a 
high altitude for a long time. 
  At the same time, A P-3 off-the-shelf aircraft [panjamgi] 
belonging to the Seventh U.S. Fleet flew into the skies above 
the East Sea of South Korea and then ran wild in carrying out 
espionage on our side's coastline and sea. A U-2 high-altitude 
strategic reconnaissance plane madly photographed and carried 
out electronic reconnaissance on areas in the Northern half of 
the Republic while flying day and night in the skies above an 
area near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets were frenzied in 
firing bombs near the MDL in the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ], as 
well as increasing armed troops there. On 6 May, the South 
Korean puppets mobilized and deployed several tens of 
large-caliber gun units in Kumsan-ri, Puju county, with their 
barrels turned toward Songdong- ri, a western area of the front 
line in front of us, and moved hundreds of rascals with heavy 
arms [chungmujang aktangdul] forward from Hyon-ri, Imje county, 
an eastern area of the front line, and deployed them in an area 
adjacent to the DMZ. 
  On the same day, after occupying firing positions at 
Chongja-ri in Paju county and Kangnae-ri in Yonchon county, the 
puppet Army's large-caliber artillery units showed off a war 
frenzy by firing tens of bombs at an area near the DMZ. 
  These war maneuvers are a grave challenge to detent and 
peace 
on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] According to Seoul radio, the nation-selling Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous clique proclaimed [kongpo] on 6 May that the 
puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force will stage a joint tactical 
exercise for the first half of the year, a new large-scale war 
exercise, from 9 through 14 May. 
  The puppet clique is planning to carry out operations on the 
ground, in the air, and in the sea -- including a battle 
exercise; a chemical, biological, and radiological war exercise; 
an exercise on transporting troops and equipment; and a takeoff 
and landing exercise on emergency airstrips -- in the north of 
Kyonggi Province near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL], South 
Kyongsang Province, and the West Sea of South Korea. The puppet 
clique is also planning to mobilize many domestic reserve troops 
for this war exercise. 
  The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets should think 
deeply about the grave consequences as a result of their 
criminal act of driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to 
the brink of war by repeating armed reinforcement and war 
exercises.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous clique Friday announced that a large-scale war 
exercise called a "joint tactical exercise in the first half of 
this year" would be staged by the puppet army, navy and air 
forces from May 9 to 14, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The puppet clique plans to launch a three-dimensional 
"operation" on the ground and in air and sea including combat 
preparation exercise, chemical, biological and radioactive 
exercise, movement of armed forces and equipment, take-off and 
landing exercise on emergency runway, etc., and mobilize even 
the "homeland defence reserve forces". 
  Bellicose elements of South Korea, in a bid to justify their 
planned provocative war exercise, make an absurd pretext of 
"coping with surprise attack by the enemy". 
  The large-scale war exercise aimed at perfecting the attack 
posture of the puppet army, navy and air forces against the 
North arouses a precaution of people because it will be staged 
while stepping up preparations for a war against the North in 
the wake of the U.S. defense secretary's trip to Seoul. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should 
ponder over the grave consequences arising from their criminal 
act of leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the 
brink of war with repeated arms buildup and war exercises.

  [Text] The South Korean puppets have committed a grave 
military provocation inside the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ]. 
  The South Korean puppets on 8 May committed a grave military 
provocation by deploying armored cars into the DMZ south of 
Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, Kangwon Province in the eastern section 
of the front line. 
  On the same day at around 1855, the puppets mobilized 
armored 
cars from the direction of Sowha-myon, Imje County of South 
Korea's Kangwon Province to the DMZ near the Military 
Demarcation Line and assumed a firing posture aimed at our side. 
  Prior to this, the puppets, on 1, 3, and 4 May deployed 
recoilless guns and large-caliber machine guns to the DMZ 
southeast of Kijon-ri, Changpung County, in the western section 
of the front line and set up a position. 
  On 5 May, they ran madly about by firing some 70 
large-caliber machine gun bullets from the same position. 
  In the meantime, at around 1115 on 6 May, hundreds of puppet 
Army bandits armed with large-caliber machine guns and automatic 
weapons sneaked into the DMZ south of Peak No. 1211 in the 
eastern section of the front line, frantically staged a war 
exercise for a Northward invasion in broad daylight, which 
extremely irritated us. 
  In addition, the South Korean puppets, at around 0846 on 2 
May, committed a hostile act of dragging some 10 vehicles loaded 
with hundreds of heavily armed bandits into the DMZ south of 
Mabang-ri, Cholwon County, Kangwon Province, in the central 
section of the front line. 
  From 1 to 8 May, the number of armed bandits brought in to 
build military facilities and positions inside the DMZ and to 
conduct war exercises reached approximately 6,400. 
  The recent arms buildup -- timed to coincide with the South 
Korean puppets' war exercises for a Northward invasion staged 
with the U.S. imperialists under various titles by mobilizing 
the latest equipment of mass destruction -- is a deliberate and 
premeditated military provocative act designed to drive the 
situation surrounding the Military Demarcation Line to a 
dangerous phase. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets should 
squarely see the touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula 
due to the rascals' war provocative commotions and should not 
act recklessly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet 
defence minister, Yi Pyong-tae, during his recent trip to Japan 
discussed a military "joint countermove" of South Korea and 
Japan with the director general of the Japan Defence Agency for 
"regional security", once again taking issue with the "nuclear 
issue" of the North. And, later, the traitor Kim Yong-sam in a 
"telephone conversation" with the new Japanese prime minister, 
Tsutomu Hata, pressed home the necessity for "close cooperation" 
between Japan, South Korea and the United States for a solution 
of the "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  Commenting on this, an analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: 
  The reckless military adventures committed by the traitor 
Kim 
Yong-sam against the North up until now surpass those of the 
successive South Korean military rulers. 
  The South Korean puppets this time begged their Japanese 
master for "joint countermeasure" to harm and stifle the North 
under the pretext of its "nuclear issue". This is motivated by 
their intention to keep the U.S. imperialist aggression forces 
in South Korea and persist in their confrontation with the North 
under their military support and in league with the Japanese 
aggression forces. 
  "Cooperation" on the lips of the puppets means subordinate 
relations of tieup between the master and the South Korean 
traitorous forces. 
  "Assistance" and "cooperation" "promised" by the U.S. and 
Japanese masters to the traitor Kim Yong-sam are all prompted by 
their sinister design to gratify their military strategical 
purpose in Asia-pacific without difficulty by putting them up as 
a shock force of aggression. 
  The sycophant moves of such traitors as Kim Yong-sam who 
overshadows the "five traitors of 1905" now make it possible for 
the Japanese reactionaries to stretch their tentacles of 
reinvasion deeply into South Korea. 
  The attempt of the South Korean puppets to overpower us with 
the help of outside forces is nothing but a foolish dream.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
accuses the Japanese reactionaries of revealing their scheme to 
stage a comeback to Korea by crying for "regional security" 
together with the South Korean puppets and talking about 
"responsible countermeasure." 
  In a signed commentary on the South Korean puppet defence 
minister's trip to Japan, the paper says: 
  During the Japan trip of the puppet defence minister of 
South 
Korea, the first of its kind ever, measures for "regional 
security" to cope with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK were 
discussed. 
  If Japan is truly concerned for "regional security" it must 
take issue with the United States which poses a grave threat to 
peace and security on the Korean peninsula with a large number 
of nuclear weapons while laying artificial obstacles to the 
settlement of the nuclear issue, as well as its servants the 
South Korean puppets. 
  The Japanese reactionaries plan to inveigle South Korea and 
countries in the Asia-Pacific region in their "comprehensive 
security sphere," because it is expected that their "security" 
by the United States cannot be guaranteed in "case of 
emergency." Their recent military confab with the South Korean 
puppets was within this framework. 
  The tightening of the military tieup between the Japanese 
reactionaries and the South Korean puppets is a threat to peace 
and security in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  That is why the Asian peoples are heightening vigilance over 
the intensified military collusion between Japan and South Korea. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets must 
not act rashly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The subsidized propaganda 
machines in Seoul are getting over-heated these days in the 
anti-DPRK smear campaign through Yo Man-chol, 48, who fled to 
South Korea recently. 
  No one would lend an ear to the ugly torrent of trash 
rolling 
off the tongue of insane Yo, a human dirt. But we cannot say a 
few words about it, because his words are so disgusting and the 
South Korean puppets are doing such nasty things by manipulating 
him. 
  Yo Man-chol is a habitual criminal who committed acts never 
to be condoned under the political system of the North where a 
beautiful and sound life has become a social trait, all people 
helping each other and leading each other along. 
  While serving as a truck driver at the material supply 
center 
in Hamhung, he stole goods of the state worth more than 100,000 
won. When he was carrying materials for daily necessities by 
truck from Pyongyang to Hamhung in December last year, he 
misappropriated goods worth 30,000 won or more. This theft 
committed by him was disclosed in the course of an overall 
survey of the warehousing and delivery of materials and 
equipment at the material supply centre, and he had to face 
justice. Yo felt uneasiness and fear and this was one of the 
motives of his defection to South Korea. 
  A criminal leaves a string of bad names behind him. "A mad 
man," "a gangster," "a drunkard" and "a sex maniac" are the 
words characterising the human derelict. 
  One time he was a driver at the Hoesang District security 
station in Hamhung. In those days he stayed away from work 
quite often under the pretext of illness, and loafed about and 
had a fight with his colleagues frequently. 
  In May 1983, while driving his truck, dead drunk, he hit a 
bus stop, inflicting heavy wounds on a number of people standing 
there. 
  Still more grave is that he styled himself an officer of the 
traffic safety section of the district security station, going 
in false security officer's uniform. In July 1986, disguised as 
a senior captain of the public security station, he stopped many 
trucks on a night street for no reason and, like a robber he is, 
forced the drivers to do something to line his pocket. 
  For these crimes he was disciplined and ousted from the post 
of the truck driver of the district security station. 
  The fatal evil practice of Yo Man-chol is sex mania which 
would make even a brute blush for shame. 
  Not only once he got it in the neck while attempting to rape 
married women. One night in February 1987, in nothing but 
pajamas, he broke into the house of a single woman in his 
neighbourhood unit and attempted to rape her, only to be 
trounced by the neighbours who came rushing at the scream of the 
woman. 
  His beastliness as a sex maniac reached the climax when he 
attempted to rape his eldest daughter Yo Kum-chu, 20, a district 
kindergaderner. One day in March 1992, when his wife, Yi 
Ok-kum, 45, who was a photographer at the Hoesang District light 
labor shop, Hamhung, was gone to her parental home in Kapsan, 
Yanggang Province, he drank like a fish at home and threw 
himself upon his daughter Kum-chu who was 18 years old at that 
time. When she resisted, he hit her on the head with a spanner, 
injuring her. When his eldest son Yo Kum-yong, who awoke, tried 
to stop him, he beat him on the head, leaving him in a critical 
condition. 
  His attempt to rape even his daughter under age, an act 
beyond human imagination, is enough to show what a despicable 
dirt Yo Man- chol is. 
  All this glaringly proves that Yo Man-chol is a criminal, a 
mentally deranged person and a human dross who do every evil 
without the elementary morality, conscience and ethic as a human 
being. 
  It is only too natural that such human derelict became a 
target of the accusing fingers of people. He became an object 
of guard not only among the neighbours but also among the 
Hamhung population who did not want him to live among them. 
  He was compelled to move to Yanggang Province where his 
wife's parental home was. But, there also, he was rejected by 
people as a human rubbish. Yo's mental agony grew with the 
passage of time. 
  To cap it all, his misappropriation of a huge amount of 
property of the state was brought to light, leaving him no room 
to remain under socialism of our style centered on the popular 
masses. What he chose, driven to the bay, was to flee to South 
Korea. 
  A deer lives among deers and a dog among dogs. It is only 
too clear that the asylum for Yo Man-chol whose career is 
stained with indelible crimes and depravity, was the den of the 
South Korean puppet clique, the habitat of offscourings which 
invites and "welcomes" any human derelict, if it is for the 
anti-DPRK political smear campaign. 
  Still more ridiculous is the mean act of the South Korean 
puppet clique in using Yo, who can hardly rank among 
human-beings, as a propaganda tool for their sinister political 
purpose. 
  The foolish attempt of the Kim Yong-sam clique to impair the 
image of our socialist system centered on the popular masses, 
under which the people of the whole country form a big 
harmonious family, by using such immoral human dirt, brings into 
the open the moral inferiority of the puppets. 
  Not much penetration is needed to see that the anti-DPRK 
smear campaign of the puppets through Yo Man-chol is underlain 
by the foolish and sinister intention to evade the crisis of 
destruction by lulling the anti-kim Yong-sam sentiments daily 
mounting among the South Korean people. But this will lead them 
nowhere. 
  The barking of dogs cannot move a big mountain and the 
outcries of human rubbish will only sound like a lamentation 
over the "civilian regime" of Kim Yong-sam on the threshold of 
death.

<F P=106> ["Repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan Demanded"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- South Korean rulers must 
stop trying to use for insidious political purpose the issue of 
old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken prisoners 
during the war and had been kept in prison for many years, 
unconverted, and unconditionally send them back to the northern 
half of the country, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed article 
today. 
  Recalling that the South side refused to send back Kim and 
Ham under an unreasonable pretext once again when the North side 
demanded their repatriation, the paper says: 
  This is a gross violation of the international humanitarian 
law and an unpardonable crime contrary to morality. 
  According to the provisions of the international 
humanitarian 
law, all of POWs are to be repatriated to their homeland 
immediately after the end of hostile acts. The South Korean 
authorities are only bound to send POWs Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan back to the North. 
  However, the successive rulers of South Korea had kept Kim 
and Ham in prison respectively for 33 years and seven months and 
34 years, cruelly torturing and persecuting for the mere reason 
that they refused to be converted ideologically. They are 
denied to have communication with their families and relatives. 
  They, old valetudinarian men released from the prison, are 
maintaining the barest existence with toilsome physical labour 
in South Korea. Their hope is only to go back to the northern 
half of the country at an early date and live a quiet life for 
the rest of their days under the warm care of the thankful 
system and their families and relatives. 
  Their repatriation to the North is a matter out of politics, 
a matter of human conscience and morality. "Human rights" and 
"unification" much touted by the South Korean rulers while 
persistently detaining and persecuting Kim and Ham, refusing to 
send them back, are nothing but a deceptive argument. 
  If the South Korean authorities persistently block their 
repatriation, they will face a bitter condemnation at home and 
abroad, as a violator of the international humanitarian law and 
morality.

<F P=106> ["Development of Fast Breeder Reactor Must Be Stopped at </F>
Once"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
denounces the South Korean puppets' move to develop a fast 
breeder reactor under the nuclear umbrella of the United States, 
secure larger quantities of plutonium and manufacture nuclear 
weapons with it, as an unpardonable archcrime against the nation. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The white paper on the development of a fast breeder reactor 
by the South Korean puppets, which was recently issued by the 
South Korean National Democratic Front, shows how desperately 
the South Korean puppets work to develop nuclear weapons. 
  The South Korean puppets claim that the fast breeder reactor 
is the "most efficient source of energy" and its development is 
needed for "economic value." Their third-rate trick, however, 
cannot work. 
  They are desperately working to develop this type of reactor 
because they scheme to produce large quantities of nuclear 
weapon-grade plutonium and increase the amount of its 
stockpiling through legitimate import of plutonium under the 
pretext of feeding the fast breeder reactor. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must close down the 
pressurized heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose reactor 
and immediately stop the development of a fast breeder reactor 
before it meets with a bitterer denunciation and rejection at 
home and abroad as a nuclear maniac.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Corruption of Kim Yong-sam Group" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
has never let a chance pass by without saying "he would not 
receive or request political funds from anyone." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands his remarks 
as 
a lie. 
  Though the traitor is still advertising his "uprightness," 
the offensive smell is coming from "Chongwadae [presidential 
office]," the analyst says, and goes on: 
  A few days ago, the president of the Democratic Party of 
South Korea told a special press conference that Kim Yong-sam 
was involved in the large-scale sangmudae political fund scandal 
which has caused quite a stir and urged him to make the case 
clear. 
  The scandal means that a big part of some 150 billion won 
earmarked for the project of the transfer of the Sangmudae 
Military Training Centre of the puppet army in Kwangju flowed 
into "Chongwadae," "the Democratic Liberal Party" and "the 
administration." 
  With the opposition party's offensive intensified over the 
scandal, "Chongwadae" and "the DLP" are now trying hard to hush 
it up. 
  Kim Yong-sam, the chieftain of corruption, is crying in 
public for "a thorough investigation into the scandal," while 
covertly manipulating the prosecution to hush it up. 
  It has been revealed once again that the "civilian" clan 
including the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "DLP" and 
"administration" is a gang of robbers. 
  To cap it all, it has been brought to light that the second 
son of the traitor took 120 million won as a political fund from 
the Han Yang Business Relief Committee with a promise to "settle 
the public appeal." 
  With public resentment growing in this regard, "the 
civilian" 
regime is trying to shift the blame for the Sangmudae scandal on 
to "Chongwadae in the Sixth Republic" and the blame for the 
scandal related to the second son of the traitor on to the 
former "chief secretary of Chongwadae in charge of 
rectification." The traitor Kim is a master hand in dodging the 
blame by shifting it on to others. 
  The "civilian" regime's advertisement about "uprightness" 
and 
"liquidation of corruption" has fallen on the ground. The 
reality shows that the "civilian" regime is more corrupt than 
the "Fifth and Sixth Republics." 
  The Kim Yong-sam group had better step down from power 
before 
it is too late.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The death of Chang 
Tok-su, a student of the faculty of business economics of Sejong 
University in Seoul, in a reserve force training at a puppet 
Army unit of South Korea on May 3, has turned out to have been 
caused by a live bullet, not by a blank shot as had been 
announced by the puppet Defence Ministry, according to a radio 
report from Seoul. 
  This was verified when a M-16 gun bullet was found in his 
body in an autopsy done by the Scientific Investigation 
Institute on May 5. 
  Prof. Yi Yun-song of Seoul National University, who had 
participated in the autopsy, also stated that the death of the 
student was by a live bullet. 
  The bereaved family of the student and representatives of 
Sejong University are angrily denouncing the criminal act of the 
warmaniacs and strongly demanding the resignation of the puppet 
minister of defence. 
  The General Student Council of Sejong University at a press 
conference on May 4 urged the resignation of the puppet 
minister of defence, declaring that Chang Tok-su died because of 
the unprecedentedly intensive, murderous training.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published 
an open letter on April 30 exposing the anti-national and 
inhumanitarian development of chemical weapons by the South 
Korean authorities, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of 
National Salvation. 
  The letter says: 
  It was in the late 1960s and the early 1970s that the South 
Korean military fascist group made the development of chemical 
weapons its policy. 
  When Nixon made public the "Guam Declaration" in 1969, the 
military fascist regime defined it as the keynote policy of the 
dictatorial regime to develop chemical weapons along with 
nuclear weapons under the pretext of "filling up the blanket 
caused by the reduction of the U.S. Forces." This policy was 
pursued by the traitor Pak Chong-hui and then in the days of 
Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and is now being stepped up by Kim 
Yong-sam. 
  South Korea has produced large quantities of chemical 
weapons. 
  The authorities have introduced many chemical weapon 
factories. There are eleven companies producing MIC (methyl 
isocyanate) in South Korea, all of them brought from the United 
States. 
  In an Asian country, this poison gas leaked from a chemical 
factory for 12 hours to leave some 4,000 people dead, 20,000 
blind and 200,000 poisoned within the radius of 40 kilometres. 
  The authorities are building by themselves many factories of 
awfully deadly poison gas. Factories producing such kind of 
toxic gas number ten or more, among them the TDI (toluene 
diisocyanate) in the Imhae complex, Kunsan, the Inchon factory 
of the oriental chemical industrial company, the Korea Pacific 
Chemical Corporation and the Sam Yang Chemical Company. They 
produce chemical weapons under the cover of production of 
chemicals for civil use, and deliver them to the military. 
  TDI and phosgene, chlorine and other materials used in it 
are 
strong poisonous substances which are themselves chemical 
weapons. 
  The annual production of phosgene is 96,000 tons in South 
Korea (SEOUL SINMUN January 12, 1993) and gaseous chlorine 
stockpiled amounts to thousands of tons. 
  Producers of poisonous chemical materials used for the 
production of chemical weapons number more than 30 and the scale 
of the annual production of materials liable to control has 
exceeded 120,000 tons (SEOUL SINMUN, January 12, 1993.) 
  The ruling group of traitors has developed and stockpiled 
nerve gas, suffocative toxicant and other kinds of chemical 
weapons designed for attack, killing of domestic animals and 
destruction of forests in military areas and densely populated 
areas in the rear. 
  Deployed in the whole frontline areas are 15 chemical attack 
units including chemical depot No. 31 of the second logistic 
command of the Army, chemical depot No. 12 of the third Army 
support command, the 16th chemical support battalion under the 
sixth Army and the chemical battalion under the third Army. The 
chemical units continue tests of exploding, throwing and 
launching handgrenades, mines, bombs, shells, rockets, warheads 
of missile and other firing or launched and jet-propelled 
weapons which are charged with various kinds of chemical 
materials. 
  The Korean nation may suffer not only from poison gas made 
by 
South Korea but also from gas bombs of the U.S. Forces. 
  The United States, which had brought a large quantity of 
chemical weapons into South Korea, has deployed many binary 
chemical weapons in main military operational areas according to 
the decision of the 18th "South Korea-U.S. Annual Security 
Meeting" in 1986. 
  The United States and the South Korean traitors have 
steadily 
cultivated the tactics of using chemical weapons together with 
nuclear weapons in the Team Spirit manoeuvres directed against 
the North, regarding chemical weapons as "one of the main 
elements of military potentials." 
  The open letter concludes with the following words: 
  The criminal production and deployment of chemical weapons 
by 
the South Korean authorities are not only a total challenge to 
the September, 1992, international accord prohibiting the 
development, production, stockpile and use of chemical weapons 
but also a hostile act going against the North-South agreement 
on nonaggression. 
  The United States and the Kim Yong-sam group are now crying 
over "the issue of chemical weapons" of the North. This is a 
premeditated ruse to cover up their criminal preparations for 
chemical warfare. Our people must rise up resolutely in the 
massive struggle for removing the danger of a nuclear war on the 
Korean peninsula and, at the same time, checking the production 
and use of chemical weapons, the most heinous, brutal, 
anti-national and anti-human act, by the South Korean 
authorities.

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry, asked by 
a KCNA today to comment on the Japanese justice minister's 
recent outburst defending Japan's past aggression, said: 
  To the great consternation and resentment of the Korean 
people, Asian countries and the world public, Japan's Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano in an interview with the MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN newspaper 3 May said the Pacific war was not a war of 
aggression and the Nanjing Massacre was a "hoax." 
  Dismayed at the strong protest of public opinion at home and 
abroad, he called a "press conference" Friday to "revoke" and 
"apologize" for what he had said. However, it is no use crying 
over spilled milk. 
  The official statement of a country's justice minister 
cannot 
be regarded as a mistake. It reflects the political climate of 
Japan embodying militarism. 
  It has been nearly half a century since the end of World War 
II, but the Japanese authorities are trying to whitewash the 
past crimes and defend militarism, far from properly liquidating 
the past. This clearly shows they still have the old dream of 
"the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" for which they 
cried out during the Pacific war of aggression. 
  We cannot but take a serious view of the outburst because it 
came at a time when the Japanese authorities were intensifying 
their repressing and destroying maneuver [tanap malsal 
chaektong] against the General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan as never before over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK 
and undisguisedly resorting to the anti-DPRK campaign such as 
legal study to cope with the case of emergency on the Korean 
peninsula and debate on constitutional revision. 
  This proves that Japanese militarism has revived and plans 
to 
realize its aggressive design by force of arms and regards the 
Korean peninsula as the first target. 
  It is crystal-clear how dangerous it is for Japan obsessed 
with militarism and revanchism to work hard to take a permanent 
membership in the UN Security Council allegedly for its 
"international contribution." 
  The Asian peoples, who have fallen victim to Japanese 
imperialism in the past, and the peaceloving peoples of the 
world must pay due attention to and take precautions against 
reviving Japanese militarism. Japan must clearly know that 
militarist revival will lead to its own grave.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Shigeto Nagano Saturday 
resigned as justice minister of Japan in face of strong 
criticism at home and abroad, a news report from Tokyo said. 
  In an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper of Japan 
May 3, he said the Pacific war started by Japanese imperialism 
was not a war of aggression and that the Nanjing massacre was a 
"hoax." His remarks whitewashing the blood-stained history of 
aggression of Japanese imperialism and defending militarism 
greatly startled and angered the Korean people, Asian countries 
and the world public. The Japanese people and public circles 
strongly demanded his resignation. 
  Upset by this, Nagano at a "press conference" Friday 
"revoked" and "apologized" for what he had said and at last 
could not help resigning. 
  Nagano is not the first to resign as cabinet minister after 
letting out anachronistic militarist remarks. 
  The case is the same with former Education Minister Fujio 
who 
justified in 1986 the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Korea 
and with former director general of the land administration 
agency Okuno who said in 1988 that Japan had "no aggressive 
design" during World War II. Nagano had to resign in ten days 
after he was appointed justice minister in the Hata cabinet. 
  Through the shameful cases of those who resigned in face of 
strong protest and criticism at home and abroad for their 
attempt to revive the ghost of militarism, Japan must clearly 
know that militarist revival will lead to its own grave.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on Japan's decision to postpone the plutonium utility 
program. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Japan's measure does not mean abandoning the plutonium 
utility program but postponing the construction of a new 
plutonium production facility. 
  Japan's abrupt decision to postpone the program is a crafty 
ruse to convince the world public of its non-nuclear will, avoid 
international criticism and isolation and create a favorable 
climate for holding a permanent membership in the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  The decision came in the wake of Japan's calculation that 
the 
postponement of the construction of a new plutonium production 
facility will do no harm to its nuclear arms development. 
  Japan's efforts to convert itself into a military power and 
arm itself with nuclear weapons are based on revanchism. 
  The Japanese ruling quarters obsessed with the ambition to 
lord it over in the international arena as a military and 
political power regard nuclear armament as an inevitable means 
to carry into practice their ambition. 
  With no trick can the Japanese authorities conceal their 
ambition for nuclear armament. 
  Japan must give up nuclear armament, mindful that this will 
lead to its own destruction.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
Aime prefectural 100 men committee for early normalisation of 
Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations sent a letter of request to the 
Japanese prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary on April 
27, demanding the early normalization of DPRK-Japan diplomatic 
relations. 
  The letter of request said that the grave situation of the 
Korean peninsula is the result that Japan has pursued the 
hostile policy toward the DPRK in league with the United States, 
instead of liquidating its past colonial rule. 
  Japan should no longer coil up the tension, clamouring about 
"nuclear suspicion in the North", but make efforts to normalize 
the diplomatic relations and strive for peace in the Korean 
peninsula and Asia, it noted.

  "Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine

enforcing autonomy by Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. 
  "The accord signed this time, a detailed working agreement

which was signed in September last year, is a result of the 
patient efforts of the Palestinian people to retake the lost 
land and restore their legitimate national rights. 
  "The master of the Palestinian problem is the Palestinian 
people. 
  "We respect the will and choice of the Palestinian people in 
settling the Palestinian issue and consider signing of the 
accord by the Palestine Liberation Organisation to be their 
right. 
  "We hope the accord will be a basis of founding an 
independent state of Palestine and the first step for a fair and 
comprehensive solution to the Mideast problem. 
  "The Korean people will as ever actively support the just 
efforts of the Palestinian and Arab people for a peaceful 
solution of the Mideast problem including the Palestinian issue, 
standing on their side".

Congress of South Africa (ANC) on its landslide victory in the 
recently held first ever all-race general elections in history

  The article says: 
  The Korean people rejoice at the ANC's victory in the

  With the ANC's victory in the elections the racist rule 
which 
had existed for centuries has been done away with and a new life 
of equality and democracy opened up in South Africa. Tens of 
millions of black people in the country have become able to 
exercise their rights as the masters of their own destinies, 
freed from racialist maltreatment and humiliation, persecution 
and suppression. 
  The South African people will successfully realize their 
aspirations and desire under the leadership of Nelson Mandela. 
  The Korean people sincerely wish their efforts to build a 
new 
South Africa will bear a fine fruit.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Eight political parties 
and organizations of Pakistan including the National Party, the 
People's Democratic Party and the Pakistan organization for 
Afro-Asian people's solidarity issued a joint statement on April 
24 supporting the April 20 memorandum of the Foreign Ministry of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that clarified the 
main obstacle to the solution of the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula and its background. 
  The statement sharply condemned the United States and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for demanding a total 
inspection of the DPRK in a sinister attempt to stamp out its 
political system, ignoring the special position of the DPRK that 
suspended temporarily the effectuation of its withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  "We are convinced that the DPRK Government is showing 
fidelity with regard to the nuclear policy and highly estimate 
the DPRK Government for sincerely implementing the DPRK-U.S. 
agreement and pushing ahead with nuclear development under the 
strict surveillance of the IAEA. 
  "We castigate the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security 
Council for openly applying the double-standard to the nuclear 
issue under the baton of the United States," the statement said, 
and stressed: "We warmly hail the declaration of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song that the DPRK neither has nuclear 
weapons nor needs to manufacture them."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A meeting of peace 
champions and a photo exhibition were held in Pyongyang on May 6 
under the sponsorship of the Korean National Peace Committee on 
the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the 
World Peace Council. 
  Chong Chun-ki, chairman of the Committee for Cultural 
Relations with Foreign Countries and chairman of the Korean 
National Peace Committee, made a report, which was followed by 
speeches. 
  The reporter and speakers estimated the role and 
achievements 
of the world peace council in the 45-year long endeavours to 
strengthen and develop the struggle of peaceloving people all 
over the world and elaborated on the major tasks to promote the 
world peace movement and ways for their fulfilment. 
  They highly appreciated the world peace council for 
expressing firm solidarity with the Korean people in their 
struggle to achieve the reunification of the country. 
  They strongly urged that the United States stop its 
unjustifiable rackets to put pressure on and stifle the DPRK and 
accede to dialogue and negotiation for a fair solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Considering it necessary to replace the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace one and make a peace arrangement in place of the 
present armistice body in order to remove the hostility between 
the DPRK and the United States, achieve reconciliation between 
them and ensure genuine peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula because the Military Armistice Agreement [as received] 
has been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the Korean 
Armistice Commission [as received] turned into a nominal 
organisation by the unwarrantable acts of the United States, 
they expressed full support to the recent proposal of the DPRK 
Government concerning this. 
  An appeal to the peaceloving people of the world was adopted 
at the meeting. 
  It called upon all the people who value world peace and 
security to firmly unite as one irrespective of differences in 
political views and religious belief and turn out in the 
struggle to build an independent and peaceful, new world freed 
from domination and subordination, aggression and war. 
  It said: 
  After its foundation, the World Peace Council has made a lot 
of contributions to achieving national independence and social 
progress against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and 
racism, averting war and ensuring a durable peace and security 
of the world. 
  We remember the fact that it expressed full support and 
solidarity for the struggle of the Korean people to defend the 
freedom and independence of the country against the armed 
invasion by the imperialist allied forces and achieve the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the divided country. 
  To resolve the Korean question in a peaceful way is urgent 
in 
ensuring a durable peace and security in Asia and the Pacific. 
  We urge the United States to abandon its hostile policy to 
stifle Korea, the old policy of the Cold War era, and observe 
the principles already agreed on between the DPRK and the U.S. 
sides and promptly accede to the proposed DPRK-USA dialogue and 
negotiation intended to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula in a peaceful and fair way, replace the Korean 
armistice agreement with a peace one and make a new peace 
arrangement in place of the present armistice body. 
  We express the conviction that the world peace forces would 
continue to extend positive support and solidarity to the Korean 
people in their struggle to achieve the reunification of the 
country by means of confederacy based on one nation, one state, 
two systems and two governments on the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity as 
agreed upon by the North and the South of Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il sent a centenary birthday table to Kim Chang-yong 
residing in Onchon-up, Onchon County, South Pyongan Province. 
The birthday table was conveyed to her on May 6. 
  Born into a poor peasant family in the declining days of the 
feudal society of the ri dynasty, she was subjected to all sorts 
of hard toil under the Japanese imperialist colonial rule. 
  It was not until the liberation of the country that she 
could 
enjoy a life worthy of human being under the DPRK Government. 
During the fatherland liberation war she took an active part in 
the struggle for wartime food grain production and aided the 
People's Army both materially and morally. In the postwar 
period, too, she did her everything for the prosperity of the 
socialist homeland. 
  Now, she has a big family of more than 30. 
  In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today the 
number 
of those who enjoy longevity is on a steady increase thanks to 
popular policies.

full-fledged flying commander. 
  In the fatherland liberation war, he brought down with his 
propeller plane seven enemy aircrafts including two B-29s and 
two jet planes and damaged four planes.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was 
held at the People's Palace of Culture here today to mark the 
20th anniversary of the publication of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il's historic May 7, 1974 work. 
  It was attended by Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], senior officials 
of mass media and journalists and men of the press. 
  In his report at the meeting, Hyon jun guk, editor-in-chief 
of NODONG SINMUN and chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Korean Journalists Union, said the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il published a historic work on the building of socialist 
mass media on May 7, 1974 with an insight into the new 
requirements of the building of mass media of the WPK, so as to 
develop the mass media into a model of new-type mass media of 
chuche. 
  "In the work, the dear leader expounded with a scientific 
logic the character and mission of our party's mass media and 
their main tasks and principle of activity and laid down the 
policy of revolution in newspapers, news services and 
publications, so that an eternal cornerstone for our mass media 
to substantially contribute to the accomplishment of the 
revolutionary cause of chuche was laid and a revolutionary 
change took place in media activities," said the reporter. 
  "The dear leader," he continued, "said in the work that the 
mission of our party's media is to contribute to modelling the 
whole of society on the chuche idea, and clearly expounded the 
matters of principle in fulfilling it. As a result, our mass 
media have confidently advanced with a clear goal and 
orientation despite the complex situation." 
  The reporter further said: 
  "The question of the principles in the activity of our 
party's media was successfully solved, with the dear leader 
defining it in the work as the principles to regard chuche as 
the cornerstone, conduct press activities under the unified 
guidance of the party Central Committee and choose a correct 
seed and wage a speed campaign in press activities. 
  "The dear leader in the work laid down the policy of 
revolution in newspapers, news services and publications. This 
was a revolutionary policy which indicated a correct way for our 
mass media to take on true looks as mass media of chuche to meet 
the new requirements of the developing revolution." 
  Referring to the achievements in the fulfilment of the tasks 
set out in the work, the reporter said "one of the important 
achievements is that our mass media has become a revolutionary 
one with a strong chuche character." 
  "Our media fully accords with the interests of our 
revolution 
and people and their ideology and emotion and our specific 
conditions both in content and form." 
  The reporter said the mass media has played a big role in 
training all members of society into ardent communist 
revolutionaries of chuche type and powerfully arousing the 
masses in the efforts for the revolution and construction. 
  "The imperialists and reactionaries are viciously working to 
stifle our socialism," he said. "Our journalists and men of the 
press standing on the forefront of ideology must creditably 
discharge their duty and role, wielding the pen of revolution."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, the incarnation 
of faith and will, met chairmen of Primary Organisations of the 
General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, basic organisations 
of the federation, from different parts of the country. 
  He recalled with indignation that he was put to all tortures 
and maltreatment by South Korean fascist hangmen while spending 
34 years in prison after being taken prisoner by the enemy 
during the fatherland liberation war. "It is because I fought, 
regarding the great general as my mental support that I could 
win defending my revolutionary constancy, refusing to recant my 
belief in this period," he stressed. 
  Saying the destiny of the Korean people and the future of 
the 
socialist homeland lie in trusting and following the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, he asked the chairmen to do their bit in rearing trade 
union members as loyal subjects with a strong faith.

<F P=106> ["One or More Technicians and Specialists Per 6 Heads of </F>
Working Population" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The number of 
technicians and specialists is one or more per six heads of the 
working population including workers, peasants, office employees 
and soldiers in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  When Korea was liberated in 1945, an overwhelming majority 
of 
the adult population was illiterate. But Korea completely 
eradicated illiteracy by the spring of 1949, taking a long 
stride toward the civilized world. 
  The level of general knowledge of the working people went 
beyond that of the graduates from the senior middle school in 
the 1980s, taking the country as a whole. 
  The number of scientists and technicians is now 1.73 million 
in Korea which had only 12 of them at the time of liberation. 
  Sounds of bells of Korean alhphabet and adult schools for 
the 
elimination of illiteracy could be heard in Korea 45 years ago. 
But, today, the idea of lifting the level of cultural knowledge 
of all the members of society to that of the university graduate 
is near its goal. 
  The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK 
have always directed all-party, all-state efforts to the 
educational work for the future of the country and the destiny 
of the nation. Right after the liberation when the country was 
in a difficult and complicated situation, Korea discussed pencil 
production as the first agenda item of the North Korean 
provisional people's committee. 
  During the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953), a measure 
was taken to recall soldiers and send them back to universities. 
Study-while-working universities made their appearance in 1951 
when the war was at its height. 
  In 1956 when the country's economic situation was difficult, 
the universal compulsory primary education system was enforced, 
which was followed by the universal compulsory secondary 
education system in 1958. In 1959, the most comprehensive and 
complete free education system came into force for school 
education, adult education and social education as a whole. The 
universal compulsory 9-year technical education was enforced in 
1967 and the world's first universal 11-year compulsory 
education in 1972. 
  The state appropriations for education have increased by an 
average of 5.7 percent annually in the 1990s in an acute 
confrontation with the imperialist allied forces hell bent on 
stifling Korean socialism. 
  The level of knowledge of the working people has 
systematically risen under the socialist education system in 
which the state takes charge of the education of the entire 
people so that they can study free of charge all their life. 
Now all of them have the basic knowledge needed for higher 
education or the knowledge of the university graduate.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- Silk production is 
increasing in Korea. 
  The Korean Silk Association overfulfilled its April plan by 
5.7 percent, according to the data available. 
  The association fulfilled its first quarterly year plan ten 
days ahead of the schedule. 
  Korea with a long history of silk production is one of the 
famous silk production countries in the world. 
  Many large and small silk and silk-textile mills and 
workshops have been built in various places of the country. 
Among them are Pyongyang silk mill, Hamhung silk mill, 
Yongbyon, Pakchon and Kumya silk-textile mills. 
  Modern silk processing centres have been built to turn out 
2,000 kinds of silk cloth, thread and clothes including Yaksan 
silk, brocade and Kuryong silk, special products of Korea. 
  Most of them are exported to foreign countries and are 
gaining favour at world market. 
  The export output value doubled in recent five years. 
  Especially, brocade took two gold medals at an international 
exhibition. 
  The prospect of silk production is very good in Korea. 
  In recent years silk production capacity greatly increased 
with the promotion of expansion projects and the introduction of 
modern equipment. 
  Joint venture with foreign countries is encouraged. 
  Mulberry fields are expanded year by year and breeds of 
silkworms and feeds are developed, providing favourable 
conditions for development of sericulture.

  [Text] Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong, accused by 
U.S. antinarcotics authorities of marijuana smuggling, says he 
is prepared to fly to the United States if necessary to defend 
himself. After keeping a low profile for a few days, Mr. 
Thanong resurfaced in Parliament to deny all the charges at a 
press conference. He offered to resign over drug dealing 
charges only if these damaged his party and supporters and 
threatened to sue the press for publicising the accusations 
lodged against him by the U.S.. 
  Nicknamed "Po Pet," the MP for Nakhon Phanom strongly 
dismissed the marijuana trafficking allegations made against him 
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Mr. Thanong 
told almost 100 reporters and photographers he was ready to 
clear himself of the allegations and said he had never been 
contacted by the DEA. Nor was he served with an affidavit from 
the agency. 
  The MP said such accusations were damaging but he was 
"gentleman enough" not to accuse anyone else. Asked how he felt 
at being accused of having been involved in the trafficking of 
47 tons of marijuana, he said: "Just one gramme of marijuana 
would hurt me enough." 
  He said he would have his lawyer fly to the U.S. to hear the 
claims and, if necessary, he would be prepared to defend himself 
in the U.S.. 
  "I'd rather go and hear the charges myself but they advised 
I 
send my lawyer first," he said. He has a life-long visa to 
enter the U.S.. 
  The DEA has accused Mr. Thanong of involvement in the 
smuggling of 47 tons of marijuana from Thailand to the U.S. in 
the past 10 years and reported that his house in Los Angeles and 
a Mercedes Benz worth about 30 million Baht in all had been 
sequestrated. But Mr. Thanong claimed he had no business in the 
U.S. and did not own a house in California as alleged. The MP 
said he had owned a car in the U.S. but sold it. 
  "I didn't own the house or any other assets in the U.S. as 
reported," he said. He said he had consulted his constituents 
in Nakhon Phanom and Chat Thai Secretary General Banhan 
Sinlapa-acha and they all advised against his resigning as an MP. 
  The MP said he needed no parliamentary immunity from arrest 
on such charges and would resign without hesitation only if 
there was any serious damage to the House, Chat Thai and Nakhon 
Phanom people. 
  "If the (Chat Thai) party tells me to make a decision, I'll 
resign no matter whether or not I was guilty." 
  As for whether the drug charges were a political game, Mr. 
Thanong said he was "too gentlemanly to comment". "I hate to 
mention any third person unnecessarily. That's another point. 
I may be seen positively or negatively. But I am what I am." 
  Opposition figures, including Chat Thai Deputy Leader Thawit 
Klinprathum, have claimed the Thanong issue is a political ploy 
to discredit Chat Thai by digging up drug claims made against 
Mr. Thanong last year. 
  Mr. Thanong said he would be ready to testify before the 
House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs on Tuesday as asked by 
its chairman. He declined to say if he had any serious conflict 
with anyone just before the issue was publicised. He said 
everyone would naturally have some people on their side. 
  The MP said he would consult his lawyer as to whether he 
could sue newspapers, radio and TV stations which reported the 
claims. 
  "I think I'm going to take legal action against newspapers, 
radio and TV. Many times I have been hit by newspapers. I'm 
definitely going to sue if I can." 
  A few times during the conference Mr. Thanong was sarcastic. 
Asked if he believed the drug issue was part of a political 
game, he declined to give a direct answer but said only: "I'm 
not a reporter." He said the Thai press could jump to 
conclusions on anything more clearly than the police. 
  "Don't make me act like the Thai press which can make all 
kinds of judgements," he said. 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak said Mr. Thanong should be 
questioned over the claims in Thailand rather than in the U.S.. 
Mr. Marut said the U.S. should take steps under Thailand's 
Drugs Suppression and Prevention Bill and international 
agreements. Mr. Thanong would not be ousted as an MP just 
because of the claims, he said.

<F P=106> [By Walailak Kiratiphiphatphong and Peter Mitri Ungphakon] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Juridical Council has ruled that Universal 
Insurance Co, a non-life insurance member of the American 
International Group, is a foreign company and is thus prohibited 
from maintaining branches under the 1992 insurance law. 
  The ruling amounts to only a legal opinion given to the 
Government and can be challenged in court. It is a rejection of 
the claim by the US Government that Universal Insurance (known 
in Thai as Phaisan) is a Thai company that happens to be 99.84 
percent owned by Americans. 
  US Ambassador David Lambertson has repeatedly argued in 
meetings with Thai ministers that Universal Insurance should be 
allowed to operate branches. More recently, he has also argued 
that if Universal is indeed an American concern, then it should 
be exempt from the restrictions of the 1992 law under special 
rights granted to Americans through the 1966 Thai-US Amity 
Treaty. 
  A US official said yesterday the embassy understood from 
discussions with ministers during the period when the law was 
being drafted that it would allow rights granted to Americans 
before the law was enacted to be maintained. 
  The official said that since the embassy had yet to receive 
the report, there was no official American response. He pointed 
out, however, that the Government need not abide by the 
council's interpretation of the law. 
  The council made the determination last month but only 
notified the Commerce Ministry on Wednesday. It would appear to 
terminate the company's plan in seeking approval from the 
ministry to upgrade its 11 representative offices as branches 
unless the Americans decide to test the ruling in court. 
  According to secretary-general Watthana Ratanawichit, about 
70 legal experts of the council in a meeting last month decided 
that Universal Insurance was an American company because 99.84 
percent of its shares are owned by the American International 
Group, which includes the largest life insurance company in 
Thailand, American International Assurance (AIA). 
  The council's experts also ruled that Universal was not 
protected by the 1966 treaty because the 1992 law supersedes the 
special rights granted to Americans under that treaty. The law 
requires insurance companies to have foreign shareholdings of no 
more than 25 percent if they are to be considered Thai with the 
full rights enjoyed by Thai companies. 
  They reasoned that the treaty's status was inferior to the 
1992 law because Parliament's legislation should reign supreme. 
  The Americans have argued that Universal should be treated 
as 
a Thai concern because it was set up under full Thai ownership 
and registered as Thai before it was later taken over by the 
American International Group (AIG). 
  Local insurance companies, maintained Mr Watthana, are 
regulated and controlled by the Life Insurance Law and the 
Non-Life Insurance Law of 1967 -- amended in 1992 with the 
ministerial regulations setting out the maximum foreign 
shareholding permitted. 
  The report received by Sanit Worapanya, acting permanent 
secretary for Commerce, said that if the Government allowed such 
cases to be protected under one treaty which conflicts with 
domestic law, it would infringe on the country's sovereignty. 
  Mr Watthana said the only way for the treaty to sustain 
legality would be for the treaty to have been enacted by 
Parliament at the same time as the law. 
  He said the decision made over the case was final and the 
council would not review the case -- even if requested by the 
ministry. He also predicted that the firm would have only a 
slim chance of victory in court because 70 legal experts of the 
country have reached a unanimous opinion. [passage omitted]

not promulgate new laws or regulations to discriminate against 
foreign nationals in the service industry. Minister of Finance 
Tharin Nimmanhemin said that it is a basic commitment among 
member countries signing the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. Minister Tharin said that liberalization of service 
industry is different from other businesses. He said it 
involves licenses issued for businesses. He said the Thai 
Government plans to allow aliens to enjoy the same rights as 
Thai nationals in doing business in Thailand. He said the 
Finance Ministry will allow over five licensees of the Bangkok 
International Bank Facilities, or BIBF, to transform into 
commercial banks by 1997.

  [Text] The Burmese Government handed over 31 Thai citizens 
who had been imprisoned in Burma to Thai representatives in 
Kawthaung at 0900 today. Among the Thai representatives who 
received the Thai citizens were the 1st Army Region deputy 
commander; a representative of the 4th Army Region commander; 
the Ranong governor; representatives of the Fisheries 
Department; the chief of the Office for Protection of the 
Interests of Thai Citizens Abroad under the office of the 
Foreign Ministry permanent secretary; and officials from other 
relevant government agencies. 
  The release of the 31 Thai citizens was the result of the 
talks Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri held with Senior General 
Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, during his April visit to Burma. He asked the Burmese 
side to reduce the sentences or grant pardons to Thai citizens 
imprisoned in Burma. On 27 April, at the closing ceremony of 
the Ninth Thai-Burmese Joint Border Commission meeting, the 
chief of the Burmese delegation announced that Burma had decided 
to release 31 Thai citizens held in Burma after taking into 
account the good relations between Thailand and Burma and the 
success of the meeting.

  [Text] Two more suspects are wanted in connection with a 
spate of bombing attacks in the South and Thailand is seeking 
their extradition as they have been hiding in a foreign country, 
Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset said yesterday. Mr. 
Chamni did not name the suspects or the country. 
  He said Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre 
director Wisut Singkachonworakun told Interior Minister Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut yesterday that police were gathering evidence 
against the two in order to seek their extradition. However, a 
source in the South named them as Domae or Romae Bron and Mada-o 
or Ro-seng Krongpinang and said they had been hiding in Malaysia. 
  Four Islamic teachers in Songkhla's Chana District were 
arrested on Wednesday and charged with taking part in eight 
different bomb attacks from May 1991 to March 1994, rebellion 
and premeditated murder. 
  Gen. Chawalit said yesterday he had ordered police handling 
the case against the four and the Songkhla governor to ensure 
fair treatment of the suspects. A number of southern New 
Aspiration Party MPs met him yesterday and expressed concern 
over the case he said. 
  Gen. Chawalit said he told the MPs that the four would be 
regarded as innocent and subject to proper treatment. It would 
not be right for authorities not to allow their relatives to 
visit them or have them handcuffed. The case must be dealt with 
as quickly as possible to prevent further problems. 
  The minister believes there will be no protests over the 
arrest. The chairman of the Association of Islamic Schools 
yesterday warned authorities concerned to be careful in their 
handling of the case against the four teachers. 
  Nidir Waba said if the charges against the suspects were 
proved groundless, problems would follow. He said the arrest of 
the four had affected the image of Ponoh schools -- private 
schools teaching Islam -- in the South. 
  Dr. Ismael Ali, director of the Islamic College of the 
Prince 
of Songkla University, said the arrest of the four was intended 
to discredit private schools teaching Islam and their teachers. 
He said he knew the four well because they were his juniors 
while he was studying in Saudi Arabia. 
  "All of them are good men. I doubt the possibility of their 
having committed such serious crimes," he said. The four 
suspects are Sa-ali or Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or 
Mut Loman, Suroma or Daman Leduwi and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya 
Hamanapden. Muk Sulaiman, a New Aspiration Party MP for 
Pattani, said Gen Chawalit was not happy about the arrest. 
  He said he personally believed that incidents in the South 
were a result of dissatisfaction with Police Chief Gen. Pratin 
Santipraphop. The arrest of the four might lead to a protest, 
Mr. Muk said. He would be a defence lawyer for the four. 
  Ahseed Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of 
Songkhla, yesterday went to meet Songkhla Governor Yuwat 
Wuthimethi and asked to know the facts behind the arrests. Mr. 
Ahseed said people of Chana District felt hurt by what happened 
to the four and were about to protest when they first heard 
about it but he asked them to stay calm. He said Islamic 
leaders were still shocked by the arrest which was quite 
unexpected. He said: "I can speak on behalf of fellow Muslim 
people that we would not protect wrongdoers. Wrongdoers must be 
dealt with according to the law. But what just happened was 
unexpected."

  [Text] Police in southern border provinces have been 
ordered to keep a close watch on Muslims and to stop them from 
gathering in Hat Yai to protest the arrest on Wednesday of four 
Muslim teachers suspected of involvement in eight different bomb 
attacks between May 1991 and March 1994. 
  Police in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat were ordered to try 
to 
stop people gathering in either Chana District or Hat Yai town. 
A checkpoint will be set up at Don Yang intersection in 
Pattani's Nong Chik District and at an adjoining area in 
Narathiwat and Pattani Provinces. 
  Police fear Muslims will come to Hat Yai in their thousands 
today to see off relatives leaving for Mecca on the annual 
pilgrimage and take the opportunity to stage a protest. This 
will make it difficult for police to differentiate between 
protesters and relatives. 
  The four suspects, all Islamic teachers in Chana District, 
were arrested in Chana District on Wednesday. They are Sa-ali or 
Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or Mut Loman, Suroma or 
Daman Leduwi, and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya Hamanapden. The four 
have been charged with premeditated murder, rebellion and 
possessing ammunition illegally in addition to the bombing 
charges. 
  Region 9 Police chief Lt. Gen. [Lieutenant General] Michai 
Nukunkit said police had acquired sufficient evidence to believe 
the four and 20 others still at large took part in eight 
different bomb attacks as follows: 
  -- An explosion at a bridge in Bacho District of 
Narathiwat Province on May 13, 1991; 
  -- A bomb attack on a train in Chana District of Songkhla 
Province on May 25, 1992; 
  -- A bomb explosion at Hat Yai Railway Station in Songkhla 
Province on August 13, 1992, killing three people and wounding 
75 others 
  -- A bomb attack on a marine police boat in Pattani 
Province on December 6, 1993; 
  -- An explosion at Dechanuchit Bridge in Pattani on 
December 25, 1993; 
  -- A bomb attack on a train in Songkhla's Chana District 
on March 8, 1994; 
  -- An explosion in front of a bookstore in Hat Yai on 
March 20, 1994, and 
  -- An explosion on the rail track in Na Mom Sub-district 
in Songkhla Province on March 30, 1994. 
  Pol Lt. Gen. Michai claimed the four and their colleagues 
were part of an organization with links to a foreign country. 
The evidence against them was strong enough for police to be 
certain they are not scapegoats, he said. He alleged the group 
had also worked together with the Pattani United Liberation 
Organization (PULO) with the objective of overthrowing the 
Government. 
  Pol Lt. Gen. Michai does not believe the group is 
responsible 
for torching 36 southern schools on August 1 last year. Police 
will continue to gather more evidence to nail the suspects, he 
added. 
  Police Director General Prathn Santipraphop said in Bangkok 
the four were certainly not "scapegoats" as police had acquired 
hard evidence against them. Arrests of "scapegoats" might have 
been widespread in the past, but not this time, he said. 
  Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wuthimathi said the strong evidence 
meant the four suspects would face legal action despite being 
Islamic teachers. The four, who studied religion abroad, will 
be held for further legal processing in Songkhla. They will not 
be granted bail until questioning is finalised. said Mr. Yuwat. 
  Asit Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of 
Songkhla, said the people of Chana District did not believe the 
four suspects were guilty as charged. They said it was not 
possible for the four to have conducted such serious crimes, he 
said. 
  Fourth Army Region Commander Lt. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya 
said 
he did not believe there would be an uprising over the arrest of 
the four Islamic teachers because all wrongdoers must face legal 
action. He said he had not received a detailed report of the 
arrest but believed the police must have sufficient evidence to 
take such action. 
  Rewat Ratchamukda, chairman of the Islamic Committee of 
Narathiwat, said the arrest had sparked unrest among Muslim 
people. Never before have Islamic teachers been suspected of 
involvement in sabotage and there are doubts surrounding the 
arrest of the four, he said. Mr. Rewat said he hoped 
authorities would provide the suspects with due justice. He 
asked fellow Muslims to cooperate with authorities to prevent 
possible interference by a "third hand" in causing further 
divisiveness in the country.

  [Text] A new "mass socialist organization" yesterday dared 
exiled Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose 
Maria Sison [Joma] to issue arrest orders to its leaders and its 
10,000 members. 
  In a statement, the Mapagpalayang Kilusan ng mga Anak Bayan 
[Liberal Movement of Children of the Nation] (Makabayan) said 
that since they share the same views and principles espoused by 
the CPP's "breakaway" faction, they are probably guilty of the 
same "crime" Felimon Lagman, alias Carlos Forte, allegedly 
committed against Sison. 
  Sison reportedly issued an order for Lagman's arrest and 
trial in a revolutionary people's court where evidence against 
him will be presented. 
  Makabayan described Sison as a "madman from Utrecht" who is 
a 
"terminal case of revolutionary insanity." 
  The group called on Joma to cease and desist from his "kind 
of deadly game." 
  "You have lost your sense of principles and revolutionary 
morals... And you have lost and bungled the revolution you 
yourself started twenty-five years ago," Makabayan said. 
  The Bukluran ng mga Manggagawa Para sa Pagbabago [Union of 
Workers for a Change] (BMP), meanwhile, criticized Sison for 
"dragging legitimate people organizations like the BMP and 
Sanlakas [Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan -- 
Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People]... into their 
planned bloody purges." 
  The BMP defended Tony Cabardo whom they said "has done 
nothing but work for the success of people's struggles." 
  Cabardo, the BMP said, worked for the P [pesos] 35 workers' 
wage campaign last year and the Kilusang [Movement] Rollback 
against oil price increase.

  [Text] Breakaway communist leader Felimon Lagman faces 
assassination from the military and anti-communist agents for a 
bungled anti-communist plan last year, self-exiled communist 
founder Jose Ma. Sison said yesterday. 
  In a statement sent from his base in Utrecht, The 
Netherlands, Sison said Lagman need not worry about being 
executed by former comrades in the Communist Party of the 
Philippines [CPP] because agents of the military and 
anti-communist forces are likely to get to him first and blame 
the New People's Army [NPA] for his death. 
  According to Sison, he has information that Lagman, former 
chief of the Manila-Rizal Committee of the CPP, was part of a 
plan hatched in December last year to form a national 
coordinating board for an anti-communist "united front." 
  Lagman, however, backed out of the plan and "torpedoed" it, 
earning the ire of the military and anti-communist forces who 
had designed the plan, Sison said. 
  "In my opinion, Lagman has more to fear from the military 
and 
his fellow contras. They are capable of eliminating him and 
then holding the New People's Army responsible," said Sison. 
  Sison also belittled a warning by Lagman that should there 
be 
a communist arrest order for him, his men will kill Sison in 
Utrecht. 
  "I should thank Lagman for unwittingly confirming the 
assassination plot designed by the military and such renegades 
as Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, and Antonio Cabardo," said 
Sison. 
  "I now laugh it (death threat) off because since the first 
time he (Lagman) had made the threat, precautionary measures 
have been adopted on my part," he added. 
  The Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (RCTU), an 
underground labor organization, said there is yet no order for 
the arrest of Lagman, although charges will be filed against him 
before so-called people's court. 
  The RCTU also said in a statement that the so-called split 
in 
the communist movement is nothing but a "breakaway of some 
elements hostile to the ongoing rectification movement led by 
the CPP." 
  "The media hype and distortions about the revolutionary 
underground is unduly creating an atmosphere of animosity that 
could endanger the lives of comrades," the statement said. 
  The RCTU also clarified that the CPP never issued any hit 
list for the summary executions of breakaway rebel leaders 
Lagman, Kintanar, Tabara, and Ricardo Reyes. 
  "There are no such hit lists, only charges that have still 
to 
be duly processed in the revolutionary courts," the group said. 
  According to Sison, Lagman faces possible death in the hands 
of the NPA only if he resists arrest and "continues to be armed 
and dangerous." 
  Sison also said Lagman should not fear trial by a people's 
court because his former comrades assure him of due process. 
  Lagman, in a telephone interview with INQUIRER dared former 
comrades to "come and get me." 
  He said if any armed partisan tried to arrest him, he and 
his 
men will retaliate against Sison in Utrecht. 
  "We will not retaliate against Sison's men here. We will hit 
the head itself in Utrecht," said Lagman.

  [Text] Prospects of finding oil and gas in Mindoro have 
brightened as oil and gas readings were recorded over the 
weekend, the Department of Energy (DOE) said yesterday. 
  Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said in the drilling 
bulletin released yesterday that Anderman Smith Philippines 
Inc., operator of the Cambayan well in onshore Mindoro, 
encountered gas readings of propane at various intervals while 
drilling. 
  Bomasang said the U.S.-based Anderman Smith has drilled the 
Cambayan-1 well to a depth of 6,285 feet. The operator will 
continue drilling this week. It is targeting to reach a depth 
of 8,000 feet. 
  Anderman Smith is slated to drill two wells in Mindoro 
within 
the year requiring some $2 million in investment. The second 
well will be drilled right after the first well. 
  Anderman Smith's partners in the exploration of the Cambayan 
area in Mindoro are the PNOC [Philippine National Oil Company] 
Exploration Corp., The Philodrill Corp., Basic Petroleum and 
Minerals Corp., Terra Grande Resources and Exploration Inc., 
Vulcan Industrial and Mining Corp., and Anglo-Philippines Oil 
and Mining Corp. 
  Still on oil exploration, Bomasang said the Australian oil 
firm Ampolex Ltd. spudded the Villaba-1 well in offshore Leyte 
last 1 May. Its drill ship, the "Ocean Clipper," has drilled to 
a depth of 1,723 feet. Ampolex is scheduled to drill to a depth 
of 6,234 feet. 
  At the same time, the French Government through Trans Energy 
has signed an agreement with the Energy Department of conduct a 
technical and feasibility study for the setting up of a 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Luzon. [sentence as 
published] 
  Bomasang said the project will not entail any cost on the 
part of the government. 
  Trans Energy according to Bomasang, will also provide a gas 
market profile for Luzon. He said that it was the French 
Government that broached the idea of undertaking such a 
feasibility study. 
  The French company has started a preliminary survey among 
economic planners, policy makers, and different agencies 
involved in power generation to assess the technical and 
economic feasibility of setting up an LNG tanker facility. 
  The DOE is planning to tap natural gas as a source of energy 
by the turn of the century especially with the ongoing 
exploration at the Camago-Malampaya field in northwest Palawan. 
  Shell Philippine Exploration and Occidental Petroleum are 
currently drilling a well at Camago-Malampaya to confirm 
reserves of some two to five trillion cubic feet of gas.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 9 -- `One enemy is too many, a hundred 
friends are too few.' Such is the Vietnamese saying which is 
often quoted these days by mouth and in deed by the Vietnamese 
leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are 
the visits to Indonesia and Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to 
India by Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh, the 
visits to Vietnam by dignitaries from the Czech Republic and 
Ukraine, and the constant influx of foreign business people who 
visit to probe the market opportunities in Vietnam. American 
businesses even held an exhibition in Hanoi to advertize their 
industrial and consumer goods. 
  In the 50 days from March Vietnam hosted over 50 foreign 
delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of 
business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents 
of Mongolia and the Philippines, the prime ministers of 
Singapore, Thailand, Sweden and Australia, the deputy prime 
minister of Russia, and HRH Princess Anne and minister of state 
for external relations of Great Britain. During the same period, 
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi 
visited Malaysia, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials 
visited countries in Asia and America. In the coming days, 
President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy 
Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong are expected to visit various 
countries and regions in the world. 
  On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their 
guests and hosts that `Vietnam wants to be friend all the 
countries in the world', that `Vietnam is trying to build a 
law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an 
equitable and civilised society', and that `Vietnam pursues an 
open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and 
multilateralise its international relations'. 
  These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have 
fought 
through four decades of war to defend and build their country. 
They are also in line with the current trend of the world. 
  In fact, Vietnam has been moving along these lines since the 
beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of 
the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements, 
including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the 
people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country, 
the world is seeing Vietnam make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8, 
which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years, 
export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850 
joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total 
prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion USD. Visiting these 
joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German, 
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages. 
  The world also sees an increased presence of American 
businesses in Vietnam. The lifting of the US embargo against 
Vietnam has finally driven home to many Americans that they have 
come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that 
American economic interests in Vietnam are already, really 
sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told this writer that 
when the remaining few consular matters are settled, Vietnam and 
the US will open representative offices at each other's capital. 
  When that comes, it will be yet more proof of Vietnam's 
successes in its renewal cause which has helped Vietnam improve 
its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and 
international institutions and organisations.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 6 -- A grand meeting was held here 
today to mark the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu battle 
-- most resounding victory of the Vietnam Army over the French 
expeditionary force (May 7, 1954). 
  Prominent among those present at the event were party 
General 
Secretary Do Muoi, President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, and General Vo 
Nguyen Giap, former commander-in-chief of the VPA and commander 
of the Dien Bien Phu battle. 
  In the key-note speech at the meeting, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet said: 'The Dien Bien Phu victory entered into the history 
of the Vietnamese people as a bach dang, a chi lang, and a dong 
da battle in the 20th century, a golden marker in the 
thousand-year history of building and defending the nation, a 
real and legendary exploit in the Ho Chi Minh time. 
  That is an ever lasting pride of the Vietnamese people, a 
source of encouragement to all nations in struggle for national 
independence, freedom and the human values'. 
  The prime minister pointed out that the Dien Bien Phu 
victory 
was made from the braveness and growth of the whole nation, the 
correctness of the revolutionary line, the vitality new regime, 
new society and new state in face of war challenges, the 
strength of the Peoples Armed Forces and the international 
support which the Vietnamese people remember and for which they 
were grateful to forever. 
  The victory, he said, is heritage of the national tradition, 
the development of the august revolution, and the crown of the 
first war of resistance. 
  The prime minister said that the Vietnamese people were 
launching a new struggle for prosperity, happiness and social 
justice. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said he strongly believed that 
the 
Vietnamese people would push up the current process of 
renovation and development to steady success. 
  After reaffirming Vietnam's persistent foreign policy of 
being friends with all countries in the world, Prime Minister 
Kiet noted: `After Dien Bien Phu especially in recent years, the 
relations between Vietnam and France has clearly entered into a 
new period. The multi-faceted cooperation between the two 
countries has proved that when the two parties have mutual 
understanding and goodwill, they could totally close their past 
pages to develop their normal fine relations. 
  The prime minister called on the entire nation to 
concentrate 
on building the country as well as the tasks of defending 
national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
national security. `We should exert our efforts in 
strengthening the people's army, the people's security force and 
other people's armed forces to ensure that they would always 
play their key role together with the entire people, to firmly 
defend the airspace, the sea, and the territory, including the 
islands of our motherland', the prime minister stressed.

<F P=106> [Statement by Le Hoang Quan, party committee secretary of </F>
Bien Hoa City in Dong Nai Province; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Summary] Bien Hoa City is the cultural and economic 
center of Dong Nai Province. It is also a major economic 
development area of the southeastern region of the country. 
With a population of over 400,000 made up by 140,000 Catholics, 
30,000 Buddhists, and a number of Cao Daists, the main concern 
of the local authorities is to raise the revolutionary vigilance 
among the people, while effectively carrying out the party and 
state policy toward religions. The authorities should strive to 
avoid the situation of the enemy exploiting the extremists 
within religions to agitate the public to commit illegal 
activities. 
  To subdue the `peaceful evolution' activities in the 
locality, the authorities have to: 
  -- Strengthen educational campaigns to help cadres, members 
of the armed forces, and people of Bien Hoa to realize all 
maneuvers that enemy may use in the city. 
  -- The enemy will carry out their scheme in many fields. We 
need to consolidate the people's patriotic traditions in 
building up more steadfast armed forces that can positively 
prevent and break down all sabotage activities. 
  -- Party and state organizations should intensify internal 
security task and suppress corruption and ironhandedness. 
  -- Taking advantage of our open door policy, the enemy will 
find ways to intrude and cause disorder. Hence, we need to be 
careful and flexible while expanding our external relations and 
cooperation activities.

  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, Dong Nai Province 
has spent nearly 12 billion dong on three 15-kilovolt 
electricity projects to provide electricity service to isolated 
villages. The first project, at a cost of 4 billion dong, 
consists of a 15-kilovolt medium voltage line more than 15 km 
long, connecting Tan Phu District to the boundary of Lam Dong 
Province and a 0.4 kilovolt electricity line. The other two 
projects include a power line to Xuan Binh village, a heroic 
village in Nam Khanh District, with a total cost of more than 5 
billion dong, and a low voltage line, at a cost of more than 2 
billion dong, to Bao Han Mot village, a former revolution base 
in Thong Nhat District. 
  With local funding and public contributions, Dong Nai is 
trying to provide electricity to all villages in the province by 
1995.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
decided Saturday [7 May] that additional action by the U.N. 
Security Council against North Korea is unavoidable if Pyongyang 
does not accept by next week an IAEA (International Atomic 
Energy Agency) presence during the changing of fuel rods at the 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon. 
  The decision was made at a Unification and National Security 
Policy Coordination meeting presided over by new Deputy Premier 
and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. 
  "Our government position is that if North Korea presses 
ahead 
with changing the fuel rods by themselves, it would be 
unavoidable to take additional steps against the North," Yi said. 
  Emerging from the meeting, the deputy premier said North 
Korea has thus far maintained that it cannot allow the 
collection of samples from the reactor's spent fuel rods. 
  The meeting also decided to step up the existing system of 
cooperation with the United States, the United Nations and the 
IAEA with respect to the nuclear question. 
  As to when any additional action might come, Yi said not 
much 
time is left. 
  "The recent U.N. Security Council presidential statement has 
set mid-May as the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of 
additional IAEA inspections," he said. 
  Noting that the North Koreans' attitude remained somewhat 
ambiguous, the deputy premier said their position would become 
clear either this weekend or early next week. 
  Yi added, however, that if North Korea expressly promises to 
allow IAEA sampling of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, it 
could be taken as a sign of progress. 
  It is still unclear, he said, whether North Korea has begun 
to change the fuel rods on its own. 
  North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, in a message to 
the IAEA, said Friday his country could allow additional 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, including taking samples 
from a glove box at the key radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon. 
  But Kim said he could not promise permission to collect 
samples from the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor, a 
source said.

  [Text] A clue to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue 
is hard to come by because North Korea rejects fuel rods 
inspections. It has been learned, however, that China is playing 
an active mediating role. 
  Zhang Tingyan, Chinese ambassador to the ROK, visited Vice 
Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong today and reportedly told him 
that the Chinese Government is actively engaged in persuading 
North Korea and requested that the Governments of the ROK and 
the United States deal with the North Korean claims with 
flexibility. 
  Ambassador Zhang Tingyan reportedly said that, according to 
what the Chinese Government has found out, North Korea has not 
replaced the fuel rods yet and asked that negotiations to 
resolve the nuclear issue continue. Ambassador Zhang Tingyan's 
visit to the Foreign Ministry was made at the request of the 
Chinese side so he would explain the contact between the North 
Korean and Chinese Governments. 
  Because it has been revealed that the Chinese Government is 
actively mediating between North Korea, the ROK, and the United 
States, negotiations over the nuclear issue, which have run into 
difficulties because of the North Korean refusal to replace and 
safekeep fuel rods, are likely to reach a compromise without 
dashing toward a catastrophe. 
  Meanwhile, the ROK and the United States are said to be 
planning to propose to North Korea that the matter of fuel rods 
inspection, which North Korea rejects, be solved at the third 
round of U.S.-North Korean talks without making issue of it any 
more at the present stage. 
  It has been reported that the ROK and the United States are 
planning to disclose their position to begin additional 
inspections and technological inspections on North Korea around 
the end of this week and to hold the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks immediately after that.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 (YONHAP) -- North Korean President Kim 
Il- song promised Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1991 that 
Pyongyang would not develop nuclear weaponry, the MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN reported from San Francisco on Monday. 
  The newspaper quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that 
Kim clearly told Deng his country had neither the intention nor 
ability to develop nuclear arms during a visit to China in 
October 1991. Based on this pledge, China is continuing to 
respect North Korea's position until it can be proven that 
Pyongyang broke its promise. 
  China notified South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, during 
his trip to Beijing last March, and the U.S. Government of Kim 
Il-song's nuclear promise. Beijing also informed the two nations 
that it would take decisive action if Pyongyang broke its 
promise, according to the paper. 
  Senior Chinese leaders told President Kim Yong-sam that they 
opposed international sanctions against North Korea and asked 
Kim to understand their position, MAINICHI said. The newspaper 
said the Chinese emphasized to South Korea's president that "if 
things that impair the honor of China happen, then China will 
take decisive action." The paper noted that China also explained 
its basic position to Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary 
for political and military affairs, during his recent visit to 
China. The Chinese leaders told Gallucci that it was too early 
to prepare sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] The ROK and the United States decided that if North 
Korea changes the atomic reactor fuel rods at its five 
megawatt-class atomic reactor without the presence of an 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team, they 
will suspend the DPRK-U.S. dialogue. 
  At the high-ranking government and party policy coordination 
meeting held on 7 May, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: "The 
issue of the IAEA's presence when North Korea changes its fuel 
rods is one of the preconditions to continue the DPRK-U.S. 
dialogue." He added: "The government is currently 
strengthening cooperation with allies, including the United 
States, for a smooth resolution of the North Korean nuclear 
issue. We will work to make North Korea realize the seriousness 
of the current situation by using the DPRK- U.S. channel and the 
Chinese channel."

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- On April 28, North Korea 
offered to meet with the United States to discuss replacing the 
Armistice Agreement on the Korean war with a peace treaty. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement issued that day said the 
situation on the Korean peninsula required replacement of the 
cease-fire pact with a peace treaty to ensure "genuine peace and 
safety." 
  Pointing to the deployment of Patriot missile batteries in 
South Korea and "Team Spirit," the joint South Korea-U.S. 
military exercise, it charged that the United States has 
"completely renounced the Armistice Agreement it concluded with 
us in the name of the United Nations." 
  It added, "the Armistice Agreement has become an empty sheet 
of paper that can no longer guarantee peace on the Korean 
peninsula," taking note of the March 1991 appointment of a South 
Korean officer as chief U.N. delegate to the Military Armistice 
Commission, replacing the U.S. officer who had until then 
served as chief U.N. delegate. 
  It was on March 25, 1974, that Pyongyang first proposed a 
North Korea-U.S. meeting on replacement of the truce pact with 
a peace treaty. 
  The offer, then and now, is considered by North Korea 
watchers here to be part of a propaganda offensive against the 
South. 
  Naming only the United States as the other party to the 
peace 
talks is totally wrong, according to many North Korea watchers. 
South Korea not only took part in the truce talks through the 
commander of the U.N. Forces but also participated in the 
Geneva political talks on Korea held under a U.N. General 
Assembly resolution adopted on Aug. 28, 1953. 
  North Korea must therefore name South Korea as a party to 
the 
talks if it really wants a workable peace treaty. 
  That is why the proposal has not been accepted by the 
international community over the past 20 years since North Korea 
first made it in 1974. 
  In January 1984 North Korea revised the proposal, offering a 
tripartite meeting, apparently recognizing what was wrong with 
its 1974 proposal. 
  The North Koreans' true intention behind the peace talks 
offer is to increase "the revolutionary forces in South Korea," 
North Korea watchers say. 
  In the above-mentioned Foreign Ministry statement, North 
Korea called for a non-aggression pact, removal of war threats, 
a ban on additional deployment of troops and arms, and a U.S. 
troop pullout from South Korea, with a view to neutralizing the 
South Korea-U.S. defense treaty to break the balance of military 
power on the peninsula in the interest of South Korea's 
"revolutionary forces." 
  It should also be noted that North Korea, when making the 
first peace offer in 1974, tried to cash in on the withdrawal of 
20,000 U.S. troops from South Korea in 1971 under the 1969 
Nixon doctrine calling on Asians to guarantee their own 
security. This new U.S. Asia policy also resulted in normalized 
relations between Washington and Beijing and Tokyo and Beijing. 
  Until its first peace offer to the United States in 1974, 
North Korea had insisted on an inter-Korean peace talks proposal 
made in June 1962, while launching campaigns to "increase the 
three great revolutionary powers" and to strengthen "the four 
great military lines" on the domestic front. 
  Pyongyang's peace offer to Washington is considered to have 
three aims, according to North Korea watchers. 
  The first is exclusion of the South from the peace talks so 
that the North can take the initiative in inter-Korean 
relations. This, the North may hope, will promote 
anti-government sentiment against Seoul and further Pyongyang's 
scheme to increase revolutionary forces in the South. 
  The second is neutralization of the South Korea-U.S. defense 
treaty and the last is diplomatic isolation of the South from 
the world community. 
  A peace treaty with the United States would justify the 
legitimacy of North Korea as the only sovereign state on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Pyongyang's second peace offer appears to be aimed at 
securing a third round of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, as 
it came when the nuclear standoff remains unsettled. North 
Korea may want to raise the issue of establishing a peace treaty 
in the next meeting with the United States in a bid to divert 
the world's attention from the nuclear issue. 
  And if the third round of talks broke down, the Stalinist 
North would blame the United States for heightening tensions on 
the Korean peninsula and use this as an excuse to renounce the 
Armistice Agreement. 
  So the new peace offer, along with Pyongyang's withdrawal 
from the Military Armistice Commission, is regarded by North 
Korea watchers as psychological warfare against South Korea and 
the United States. 
  The peace proposal is just another tactical variation of the 
Stalinist country's strategy to unify the divided country under 
communism.

  [Text] Because North Korean enterprises did not pay 
Russian enterprises for their import of goods and because of 
their frequent severance of transactions with Russia, trade 
conflict between the two countries has been further aggravated. 
Quoting data provided from the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, an expert on North Korean affairs said on 7 May: Most 
Russian enterprises have smuggled their goods into North Korea 
in order not to pay an export tax. Therefore, North Korean 
enterprises have refused to pay them, citing the Russian 
enterprises' illegalities. The amount unpaid by the North 
Korean enterprises is over $20 million. 
  The total amount of Russian exports to North Korea last year 
reached approximately $200 million. Therefore, approximately 10 
percent of Russia's total amount of annual exports to North 
Korea has been embezzled by the North Korean enterprises. 
  Regarding this, Russian enterprises have asked the North 
Korean Embassy in Moscow to cooperate on solving the problems. 
The Russian trade mission in Pyongyang has strongly called on 
the North Korean Government to pay the money owed. 
  The Russian Government has reorganized its laws applicable 
to 
foreign trade and urged its enterprises to be prudent in dealing 
with North Korean enterprises. 
  North Korea, which mainly imports oil, airplane fuel, cars, 
and mineral fertilizer from Russia, has reportedly cheated the 
Russian enterprises by placing illegal terms in invoices used 
with Russian enterprises.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
organized a working-level committee to help resettle North 
Korean loggers brought here from Russia, officials said Friday. 
  The committee is chaired by Kim Si-hyong, chief assistant to 
the prime minister for administrative coordination, and includes 
the directors-general of related ministries. 
  The government plans to devise "comprehensive measures to 
support resettlement of the North Korean loggers" through the 
committee. 
  About 500 North Koreans are said to have escaped from 
Siberian logging camps and most of them reportedly hope to 
resettle in South Korea. 
  The government's support is expected to focus on helping 
them 
adapt to South Korean society and lead a stable life here. 
  The committee plans to develop programs for the loggers and

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon entitled "Thirty North </F>
Korean Agricultural Technicians Refuse To Return Home--Hope to 
Defect to the ROK While Staying in Russia] 
  [Text] It has been confirmed that not only the North 
Korean workers who escaped from the Siberian logging site but 30 
agricultural technicians North Korea has sent to Russia refused 
to respond to the summons of the North Korean authorities. They 
hope either to settle in Russia or defect to the ROK. 
  It has been learned that these North Korean agricultural 
technicians are living scattered in such areas as Moscow, 
Siberia, Sakhalin, and Uzbekistan. 
  Some of them have already visited the ROK Embassy in Russia, 
Korean Russians, or ROK businesses to express their desire to 
defect, a diplomatic source in Seoul said on 7 May. 
  The source said, "They are all specialized technicians who 
have been dispatched to Russia after meticulous screening by 
North Korean authorities. Therefore, they enjoy a better life 
economically and are treated better in Russia than the escaping 
North Korean Siberian loggers. For this reason, they pose a 
less urgent problem than the escaping loggers in our effort to 
resolve the problem for them." 
  In fact, many more of them than the loggers who are in the 
similar situation have married Russian women and hope to settle 
in Russia. 
  A considerable number of them are working at a Russian 
agricultural institute or research institute. Therefore, they 
will pose a far less problem than the loggers in respect of 
their settlement in Russia or defection to the ROK. 
  The source, however, said, "In view of their moves, living 
conditions, and relations with Russia, it is too early for the 
ROK Government to deal with the problem of assisting their 
defection and settlement in Russia." Therefore, the problem of 
these agricultural technicians may well be dealt with after the 
settlement of the problem of the escaping loggers. North Korea 
began dispatching the agricultural technicians to Russia in the 
latter half of 1980's to learn agricultural technology in order 
to improve North Korean agriculture and increase its food 
production. 
  However, some of these technicians made moves for defecting 
to the ROK and settling in Russia after the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the ROK and the Soviet Union. 
Therefore, North Korea began to summon them against their 
wishes. 
  The North Korean agricultural technicians dispatched to 
Russia are estimated to number about 150.

  [Text] North Korea has pushed ahead with the development of 
nuclear weapons since 1986 and now has a considerable amount of 
plutonium. This was revealed by Kim Tae-ho, who defected 
recently to the South, during a press conference held at the 
Seoul Press Center this afternoon. Before he defected, Mr. Kim 
was the head of a work team at the Sanamchon Chemical Complex, a 
uranium refinery plant under the North Korean Ministry of 
Nuclear Energy. Mr. Kim said North Korea began to develop 
nuclear weapons in 1986 and was able to produce plutonium in 
1988. 
  Mr. Kim, who escaped from North Korea on 2 February because 
the North Korean authorities became aware of the fact that he 
misappropriated $5,000 in foreign currency, said plutonium has 
been continuously produced in the nuclear facilities in 
Yongbyon. He claimed that although he does not know whether 
North Korea has a nuclear weapon, North Korea has attained a 
considerable technological standard for the development of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Meanwhile, brothers Hwang Kwang-chol and Hwang Kwang-il said 
they crossed the border to China last June because they were 
caught stealing food and lived a life of those who enter China 
illegally. Elder brother Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that because 
of the haphazard food rationing in North Korea, stealing food is 
a frequent practice there.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- Despite its lingering 
economic difficulties, North Korea has invested heavily in 
uranium mining and production, a recent North Korean defector 
said here on Monday. 
  "I have no idea whether North Korea presently possesses 
nuclear arms because they have been developing them in utter 
secrecy. But, I can tell North Korea's nuclear development has 
reached a dangerous point," the defector, Kim Tae-ho, said in a 
press conference. 
  In the North, Kim, age 35, had worked at the Atomic Power 
Industrial Ministry. He was the head of a waste water disposal 
team at the Namchon Joint Chemical Industrial Co. run directly 
by the Atomic Power Ministry. 
  He said uranium ores are being mined at several mines 
including the one in Sunchon, South Pyongan Province: January 
industrial mine at Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province: and Wolam 
mine at Kumchon, North Hwanghae Province. 
  "The uranium ores from these mines are shipped to two 
uranium 
refineries at the April Industrial Co. in North Pyongan Province 
and Namchon Chemical Co. in North Hwanghae Province," he said. 
  The re-refinery August Industrial Co. in Yongbyon, Kim said, 
extracts plutonium for nuclear weapons and performs work related 
to the production of uranium fuel rods. 
  He said that Namchon Chemical Co. has about 8,000 workers 
and 
turns out 8010006040ure uranium. 
  "Many of the workers there are exposed to radioactivity, 
complaining of vocational diseases such as liver ailment, 
depilation and leukosis," the defector said. 
  Productivity at these workshops, however, is extremely low 
due chiefly to superannuated facilities, he said. 
  For instance, Kim said, uranium ores transportation is 
sluggish as many trucks are idled due to the lack of tires and 
mechanical troubles are reported often at mining equipment. 
  He said he was born in Jilin Province, northern China, 
because of which he had been discriminated against. "Besides, I 
was involved in a swindle case, which made me decide to defect 
to the South," he said. 
  Two youthful brothers who came to the South along with Kim 
Tae-ho spoke of terrible food conditions in the North. 
  Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that due to food shortage, women 
in childbed are often stricken with serious diseases and it is 
not rare babies fail to walk even at two due to malnutrition. 
  Hwang said his own mother is serving a 15-year prison term 
after she stole a bag of corn from a neighbor in 1987. 
  "Together with my younger brother, Kwang-il, 18, I crossed 
the Tuman River last June and had since been living in Yanji 
before we boarded a South Korean freighter with the help of an 
ethnic Korean in China," Hwang said. 
  The three North Koreans arrived in South Korea last 
Saturday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Kim Pyong-il, North Korean 
ambassador to Finland and half brother of Kim Chong-il, recently 
returned home, giving rise to speculation that something may 
have happened in Pyongyang, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported in a 
report from Moscow Saturday. 
  Pyong-il, the son of Kim Il-song and his present wife, Kim 
Song- ae, arrived in Helsinki in early March as Pyongyang's new 
ambassador to Finland and presented his credentials to the 
Finnish president on March 18. 
  The SANKEI report said the junior Kim was just about to 
settle in at a newly purchased mansion when he abruptly flew 
back to Pyongyang on April 22. He has yet to return and take up 
his duties. 
  "His return home was in such a hurry that he didn't even 
bother to go through the required protocol of notifying the 
Finnish Foreign Ministry of his absence," the paper said. 
  Moreover, it said, his departure came several days before 
the 
Finnish president's annual reception for members of the 
diplomatic corps, an occasion which an ambassador, especially a 
new one, shouldn't have missed. 
  As Kim Pyong-il's absence drags on, Finnish papers have 
speculated on the reason for his return to Pyongyang, according 
to SANKEI. 
  One paper said Ambassador Kim's "secret-shrouded" return to 
Pyongyang might have been the result of a political conspiracy 
involving top North Korean leaders. 
  Another daily claimed Kim has been unable to resume his 
duties in Helsinki because of some unusual contingency in North 
Korea. 
  A source in the Finnish Foreign Ministry reportedly said he 
didn't know when Kim would come back to Helsinki. "We don't know 
if Ambassador Kim can return here at all," the source was quoted 
as saying. 
  The North Korean Embassy in Helsinki, fueling the 
speculation, is refusing to comment on the ambassador's abrupt 
return to Pyongyang, the SANKEI report said. 
  Some reports indicated that Pyong-il has been on bad terms 
with his half brother Chong-il, who is likely to succeed his 
aging father as North Korea's leader.

  [Text] Helsinki -- North Korean leader Kim Il-song's second 
son Kim Pyong-il has been absent from his post as ambassador to 
Finland for two weeks, the daily HELSINGIN SANOMAT reported 
Thursday. 
  Confirmation was not available from the Helsinki Embassy. 
  The newspaper, Finland's biggest, said Kim Pyong-il left the 
country April 22 after serving as ambassador for about a month 
and the embassy had not announced when he would be back. 
  He handed his credentials to President Martti Ahtisaari [as 
received] late in March, the newspaper said, adding that experts 
considered the absence odd. "He left the country just a day or 
two before President Ahtisaari's dinner for the diplomatic 
corps. The once yearly dinners are occasions not to be absent 
from. They are seen as particularly important for new 
ambassadors," the paper wrote.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The government and the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) held a policy coordination 
meeting on Saturday to decide to continue efforts to solve the 
North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. 
  The meeting, attended by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, DLP 
Chairman Kim Chong-pil and other government and party officials, 
also decided to study measures to be taken when the efforts 
through dialogue fail, officials said. 
  The meeting confirmed the position that the government 
respects the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s 
decision on the technical issues of the inspection of the North 
Korean nuclear sites and observation of the replacement of fuel 
rod of the five megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon in North 
Korea. 
  But if North Korea replaces the fuel rod without observation 
of the IAEA, suspension of the North Korean-U.S. talks is 
inevitable, the meeting reaffirmed the position. 
  The government and the ruling party discussed another issue 
of the North Korean loggers. 
  The senior officials decided to have close consultation with 
the Russian Government on the North Koreans who escaped from the 
Siberian logging camps to solve the problem in an early date. 
  They will study ways to invite international organizations 
to 
intervene in the problem in an effort to prevent possible 
diplomatic trouble with Russia. 
  Meanwhile, the government and the ruling party will reject 
the North Korean proposal to replace the 1953 Armistice 
Agreement with a peace treaty with the United States alone, 
according to officials. 
  They reaffirmed that the Military Armistice Commission and 
the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should continue to 
exist.

  [Text] As North Korea takes up offensives against the 
United States to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace 
agreement, the government has launched a program to map out 
concrete measures to settle this matter by taking it into the 
frame of the North-South Basic Agreement officially signed 
between the North and South on 14 December 1991. 
  A high-ranking government official on 8 May disclosed: "The 
majority opinion in relevant government officials and civilian 
experts holds that in the event that North Korea attempts to 
cripple the Military Armistice Committee or the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission, their function could be transferred to 
the North-South Joint Military Committee stipulated in the 
North-South Basic Agreement." 
  It was also learned that the government has devised a plan 
to 
push ahead with the adoption of a separate agreement or a 
protocol between the North and South if North Korea insists on 
the legal termination of the state of armistice. 
  It was learned that even though there is no need to fully 
confront the North's attempt to unilaterally reduce the 
agreement to a scrap of paper, the government is studying ways 
to propose inter- Korean dialogue so as to discuss the system of 
North-South Basic Agreement. 
  As regards to this, the Foreign Ministry on 5 May held a 
first round of meetings in the presence of Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, and major 
high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials. On 7 May, a second 
round of meetings was held to analyze North Korea's intent and 
discuss ways to counter it. Those who participated in the second 
round of meetings were Kim Kyong-won, former ambassador to the 
United States; Kim Tal-chung, professor of Yonsei University; 
Shim Song-pyong, professor of Kyonghui University; Yu Pyong-hwa, 
professor of Korea University; Yi Sang-u, professor of Sogang 
University; and Ha Yong-son, professor of Seoul National 
University. 
  A high-ranking official who took part in the meeting said: 
"Provision 5 in the first chapter of the North-South Basic 
Agreement adopted in December 1991 stipulates that the North and 
South should exert joint efforts to replace the present 
armistice state with the state of peace and that the two sides 
should abide by the present Military Armistice Agreement until 
the state of peace is achieved," and added that "a dominant 
opinion is that if the North-South Basic Agreement is invoked, 
the present armistice state could be replaced with a peace 
system." 
  The government plans to clarify its final stance after 
studying measures mapped out by the Foreign Ministry at a 
Unification and National Security Policy Coordination meeting.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- National Unification 
Minister Yi Hong-ku said Monday [9 May] the goals and pursuit of 
Seoul's North Korea policy should agree, though a flexible 
approach is necessary in dealing with pending inter-Korean 
problems. 
  In an article contributed to the government's weekly 
"KUKCHONG SIMMUN" issued Monday, he added that inter-Korean 
relations have a double structure of confrontation on the one 
hand and dialogue for a gradual and peaceful movement toward 
reunification on the other. 
  "Policy consistency must be maintained, but policy direction 
should be adjusted and adapted to a new situation and a new way 
of pursuing the policy should be developed," he said. 
  The current efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
problem peacefully and through dialogue should be continued, and 
the government should deal with the issue through increased 
cooperation with the international community, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Korea National Red 
Cross (KNRC) urged North Korea Monday to allow exchange visits 
by elderly parents with South Korea and to resume the 
South-North Red Cross talks. 
  Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, said 
in an address at a ceremony marking "World Red Cross Day" that 
exchanges of hometown visits by aged parents between South and 
North Korea should be realized as soon as possible. 
  "And the South-North Red Cross talks should be resumed at an 
early date," Kang said. 
  The 10th main talks of the South and North Korean Red Cross 
were held in December 1985. North Korea rejected the 11th 
talks, urging the South to stop staging "Team Spirit," the 
annual joint South Korean-U.S. military exercise. 
  An estimated 10 million people in South Korea have family 
members in the North who they were forced to leave behind during 
the 1950-53 Korean war. 
  "North Korea should keep its word, first of all that it will 
return crew members of the 'Tongjin-ho,' a South Korean fishing 
ship," Kang said. 
  Son Song-pil, chairman of the North Korean Red Cross, sent a 
telephone message to the South on Jan. 21, 1987, saying the 
crew of the Tongjin-ho would be returned. 
  The Tongjin-ho and its 12 crew members were captured by 
North 
Korean ships on Jan. 15, 1987, about 28 miles northwest of 
Paengnyong Island in the West Sea. 
  Kang emphasized that to solve these problems, consultations 
between the South and North should be realized as soon as 
possible, urging Pyongyang to give a positive answer. 
  The South Korean Red Cross is studying ways to propose the 
11th main talks of the South-North Red Cross after waiting for 
Pyongyang's reaction.

were 
795 North Koreans. 
  It is the first time the North Koreans' TOEFL scores have 
been made public. They are said to have taken the test in 
Eastern Europe because there is no test administrator in their 
country.

test, recording an average of 504, far below the world average 
of 529.5. 
  The country with the highest average was the Netherlands 
with 
605 and Japan had the largest number of examinees with 225,939. 
  The top 10 average list was led by 605 in the Netherlands, 
594 in Denmark and Trinidad and Tobago, 593 in Belgium, 592 in 
Austria and Singapore, 590 in Sweden, 589 in (West) Germany, 585 
in Britain, and 583 in Zambia. 
  By continent, Europe stood out with an average of 560, 
followed by America with 544, the Pacific with 523, Asia with 
520, Africa with 518 and the Middle East with 488. 
  Among Asian countries, Singapore posted the highest average 
of 592 trailed by the Philippines with 565, China with 531, 
Pakistan with 521, Vietnam with 511, Taiwan with 503, Cambodia 
with 498 and Japan with 484. 
  Among the 1.17 million students that took the test, Asians 
accounted for the lion's share of 73.9 percent. 
  By country, Japan had the most testees with 19.2 percent 
(225,939), followed by China (12.3 percent), Hong kong (9.1 
percent), Taiwan (9 percent) and South Korea (6.5 percent).

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
summoned Japanese Minister to Seoul Hiroshi Shigeta and 
protested Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's description of 
comfort women, who were forced to supply sex for Japanese 
soldiers during World War II, as "licensed prostitutes," Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said Saturday. 
  The ministry's Director-General of Asian Affairs, Yu 
Pyong-u, 
called in Minister Shigeta and expressed regret over Nagano's 
remark, which runs contrary to the Tokyo government's official 
position on comfort women stated last Aug. 8. 
  Nagano earlier enraged South Korea and other Asian countries 
by claiming in an interview with the MAINICHI newspaper that 
Japan was not an aggressor in the war and that the "rape of 
Nanjing," in which Japanese soldiers massacred thousands of 
Chinese civilians, was "a hoax." 
  In a separate interview with KYODO News Service, he said 
comfort women were licensed prostitutes and their use by 
Japanese soldiers therefore could not be considered an insult to 
women or discrimination against Koreans. 
  Minister Shigeta said he would report Seoul's protest to 
Tokyo. 
  Historians say some 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were 
forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers in 
front-line brothels between 1932 and 1945. Tokyo has formally 
admitted government involvement in running the brothels.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 KYODO -- A high-ranking South Korean 
Foreign Ministry official Saturday [7 May] night hailed Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to replace Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano for his controversial remarks over the 
1937 Nanjing massacre and Japan's role during World War II. 
  Yu Pyong-u, director general of the Asian Affairs Bureau, 
told reporters, "I greatly appreciate the courage and beliefs of 
Prime Minister Hata, who made a severe choice. I expect such a 
posture will turn out to be a driving force for improving South 
Korea-Japan relations." Yu added, "It is difficult for both the 
victim and the perpetrator to overcome the past." 
  Earlier the same day Japanese Ambassador to South Korea 
Toshio Goto met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to try to 
defuse some of the outrage over Nagano's remarks.

  [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign 
Ministry praised dismissal of Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano Sunday, calling it "appropriate" for building new South 
Korea-Japan relations. 
  "The dismissal of Minister Nagano was the result of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's determination and courage," a Ministry 
official said in a commentary, "it was an action reflecting 
Prime Minister Hata's awareness and efforts to build new South 
Korea-Japan relations." 
  Nagano resigned Saturday after his remarks on Japan's role 
in 
World War II ignited flurry of protest from Asian neighbors. He 
claimed Japan was not the aggressor in the war but was only 
trying to liberal Asian colonies from Europe. 
  He also belittled the rape of Nanjing as a made-up story.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Ambassador Toshio 
Goto told Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu Saturday morning that 
the Hata cabinet's view of history mirrors that of the previous 
Hosokawa cabinet. 
  Conveying the Japanese response to Seoul's official protest 
against remarks made by Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano in 
defense of Tokyo's role in World War II, Ambassador Goto said he 
had been instructed to clarify that the Hata cabinet attaches 
importance to promoting a future-oriented bilateral relationship 
and an honest view of history, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho said. 
  Goto told Han he had conveyed Seoul's concern to his home 
government, adding that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata would take 
appropriate action on Nagano's remarks upon returning from 
Europe Sunday. Tokyo will notify Seoul of any action, he added. 
  Minister Han told the ambassador that the justice minister's 
remarks had hurt and angered Koreans and that the Japanese 
Government should move to heal this hurt and prevent the 
recurrence of such remarks, Chang said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Korean shipbuilders, even 
though they have won fewer ship orders than their Japanese 
rivals this year, are excelling in terms of price per tonnage of 
ships ordered, the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
Saturday. 
  In January-March, Korean shipbuilders received orders for 
1,011,000 tons at 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, amounting to 1,196 
dollars per tonnage. 
  Japanese shipbuilders received orders for 2,969,000 tons at 
3.06 billion dollars for 1,032 dollars per tonnage. 
  With orders received in April added, Korean shipbuilders 
posted 1,299 dollars per tonnage in the first four months, while 
the data for Japanese shipbuilders in April are not available 
yet. 
  Korean shipbuilders, who secured enough orders for the 
coming 
two years already last year, have sought to win relatively more 
profitable orders since the turn of the year, while their 
Japanese competitors have employed a low-price strategy. 
  At the price per tonnage, Korea topped Japan by 837 dollars 
to 704 dollars in 1990; however, Korea lagged behind Japan with 
1,023 dollars to 1,130 dollars in 1991, and with 1,143 dollars 
to 1,513 dollars in 1992. 
  Last year, Korean shipbuilders received orders for 9,519,000 
tons at 7.35 billion dollars for 772 dollars compared with 1,231 
dollars for Japanese shipbuilders.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry said 
Monday it has instructed the South Korean Embassy in Beijing to 
make a thorough inquiry into the slaying of a South Korean 
businessman in China that was reported in the local media over 
the weekend. 
  Ministry officials said they had ordered the embassy in 
China 
to obtain information on the incident in which So in-sok, 53, a 
resident of Cheju Island, was reportedly killed by ethnic 
Koreans in Changchun city, Jilin Province, which he was visiting 
on business. 
  A local daily has quoted So's relatives as claiming that So 
was stabbed to death by second-generation Koreans living in 
Changchun who tricked him into coming to Changchun and robbed 
him of 10,000 U.S. dollars before stabbing him to death. So had 
been running a trading company in Harbin city, Heilongjiang 
Province, since May last year when he was invited to Harbin by 
his two brothers who run a Korean restaurant there. 
  Ministry officials said So's kin had requested that it 
intervene in the case, stressing they plan to act after learning 
all relevant details. 
  However, they said, "We do not think the incident resulted 
from any structural problem in bilateral relations." 
  Emphasizing that the incident may have been accidental, the 
Ministry officials hoped the case would serve as a warning for 
those wishing to travel to China.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
liberalized disembarking and embarking in the country by foreign 
seamen including Korean-Chinese crews, the maritime and port 
administration reported on Monday. An official of the 
administration said foreign seamen can now disembark at South 
Korean ports with short-term visas only. 
  In the past, Korean-Chinese seamen were prohibited from 
disembarking in the country in fear that they may illegally find 
jobs while landing. To facilitate the new step, the government 
has prepared a guideline for the issuance of visas to foreign 
seamen for implementation retroactive to May 1. It replaces the 
guideline for the issuance of visas to Chinese seamen. 
  Presently a total of 951 foreign seamen work at Korean-flag 
freighters and fishing boats.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- Short-term credits for 
exports worth up to 20,000 U.S. dollars will no longer be 
subject to government approval, regardless of whether they are 
made on a documents-against-acceptance or payment basis, 
starting next year. 
  Under the eased trade rules announced by the Ministry of 
Trade, Industry and Energy on Monday, exports and imports of 
goods worth up to 10,000 dollars -- instead of the current 5,000 
dollars -- will be exempt from after-export and -import controls 
on traders regarding whether they meet the conditions set down 
in the export and import permits. 
  At present, only letter of credit-based exports of goods 
worth up to 20,000 dollars can be made without the government's 
approval. 
  Documents-against-acceptance and payment bills are means of 
receiving payment for export shipments: While the former 
requires the delivery of shipping documents to importers when 
they accept the bill of exchange, the latter demands the handing 
over of documents in exchange for payment of the bill. 
  The new rules also provide that exports on a sight-bill 
basis, that is, a bill of exchange payable when presented to the 
importer, shall be made without a government permit, regardless 
of the exports' amount. 
  Exporters of industrial plants and machinery will be allowed 
to acquire necessary materials and equipment locally in the 
importing countries and be exempt from the requirement to 
contribute to the export promotion fund. 
  Moreover, imports of research and development equipment in 
relatively small demand can be made from any market. At 
present, importation of all research and development equipment 
from certain markets is prohibited.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's total exports 
are likely to surpass Taiwan's this year for the first time in 
six years with Korea recording relatively stable export 
increases over the past years, the Ministry of Trade, Industry 
and Energy said Monday. 
  South Korea exported 19.95 billion dollars worth of goods 
during the first quarter this year while Taiwanese exports hit 
20.1 billion dollars, according to the Ministry. 
  Ministry records, however, show that South Korea recorded a 
9.8- percent increase in exports during the period while Taiwan 
posted a mere 0.4-percent rise. 
  South Korea has recorded export increase rates exceeding 7 
percent since 1991. In particular, it has posted increase rates 
of more than 10 percent every month this year except for 
February, according to the Ministry. 
  The growth rate of Taiwan's exports, in the meantime, has 
leveled off, declining from a high of 13.3 percent in 1991 to 7 
percent in 1992, 4.3 percent in 1993 and then to just 0.4 
percent during the first three months of this year, the Ministry 
said. 
  South Korea has lagged behind Taiwan in exports since the 
1980s. The only exception was 1988, when South Korea shipped out 
60.7 billion dollars worth of goods compared with Taiwan's 60.5 
billion dollars. 
  "The Taiwanese export structure, composed mainly of light- 
industry products, faces limitations due to the stiff wage 
increases nowadays," said one Ministry official. 
  "The situation will reverse toward the end of this year 
unless something happens because South Korea shows brisk export 
increases in the heavy and chemical industries where Taiwan is 
weak," said the official. 
  South Korea took second place in the first-quarter export 
increase rate competition among the four newly industrializing 
economies, with a rate of 9.8 percent followed by Hong Kong (8.6 
percent) and Taiwan (0.4 percent), according to the Ministry. 
Singapore came first with 15.3 percent.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae yesterday returned 
home amid mixed appraisal on his first foreign visits that took 
him to Japan, Russia and Germany. 
  During the 11-day overseas tour, Yi held meetings with his 
counterparts and ranking government officials to discuss mutual 
concerns with a particular emphasis on military exchanges and 
security issues, including the knotty North Korean nuclear 
problems. 
  Of particular note was that Yi was the first defense 
minister 
ever to visit the three countries. Yi took office last December. 
  He made the significant foreign visits in line with the 
government policy to set up firm security relations with the 
surrounding nations following his April 20 meeting with the 
United States Defense Secretary William Perry he had just before 
embarking on the overseas trips. 
  "Yi's visits have significant meaning in that they were 
timed 
with the rapidly changing security situation surrounding the 
Korean peninsula," a ministry official said. 
  In Japan, Yi met former Defense Agency Director Kazuo Aichi 
and agreed to expand military exchanges, mainly between military 
personnel. 
  They reached agreement on the exchange of port calls by navy 
vessels carrying cadets of the naval academies, promising to 
realize the visit by the Korean side within the year. 
  They also signed a pact for the prevention of accidental 
collision of military aircraft by notifying in advance the other 
of flight plans in areas adjacent to open seas. [sentence as 
published] 
  The visit to Japan was evaluated to have important 
historical 
meaning in that he paved the way for the military cooperation 
between Seoul and Tokyo that has been regarded as a "taboo" 
because the people still harbor bitter feelings for Japan's 
1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea. 
  But, it lost steam since it was made in the middle of the 
political chaos in the Japanese government without being able to 
form a new cabinet after Morihiro Hosokawa resigned as prime 
minister, military observers say. 
  After a spell of confusion over his visiting schedule Yi 
managed to meet Aichi who was replaced later. 
  In Russia, Yi signed with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev a 
1994- 95 letter of intent for the promotion of military 
exchanges. 
  The two ministers agreed to upgrade the military exchange 
level over that in 1993, promising to realize mutual visits by 
ranking military leaders, with Grachev's visit to Seoul slated 
for sometime this year. 
  The two reportedly discussed the issues regarding the 
Russian 
proposal to provide South Korea with military weapons to pay off 
the $1.4 billion it owes for economic assistance. 
  But the ministry officials declined to confirm it, saying 
the 
matter is still under consideration. 
  The two ministers shared the view that the North Korean 
attempt to develop nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to the 
peace of the global community as well as in Northeast Asia. 
  In this vein, the North's nuclear ambition should be 
deterred 
under any circumstances and Pyongyang should return to the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) immediately to carry out 
its duty as a responsible member of the international community, 
they agreed. 
  The outcome of the Yi's visit to Russia was hailed as 
successful as it placed a psychological burden on the North and 
laid the groundwork for military cooperation between the 
Cold-War foes. 
  But Yi came under fire for "wasting time without efficient 
schedules from April 28 to May 3 which included weekend days and 
Russian Easter day on May 2," the observers maintained. 
  Yi focused his efforts on ensuring procurement of Germany's 
state-of-the-art military technology. But his bids seemed to 
have failed due to Bonn's cautious attitude. 
  Yi and his German counterpart Volkere Ruhe adopted a joint 
announcement pledging further military exchange, which the 
ministry greeted as a momentous result, as it was the first 
joint announcement made with non-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization) countries

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul district civil 
court on Friday dismissed a defamation suit filed by 
Chongukyonhap, or the National Alliance for Democracy and 
Unification, against President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Judge O Se-ip threw out the suit by the alliance, which was 
seeking 300 million won in compensation from the president for 
alleged damages caused by Kim's description of it as an 
organization sympathetic to communism during the presidential 
election campaign in 1992. 
  "The alliance, as an unincorporated association, is not 
entitled to bring a civil suit," O said. 
  "Even though the alliance had the outward appearance of 
being 
an organization with a name, an organizational network and 
operational functions, it could not be a plaintiff in a civil 
suit because it was not incorporated as an association," he said. 
  The alliance had accused Kim Yong-sam of "wrongly damaging" 
its reputation by describing its member organizations as 
followers of North Korean President Kim Il-song's "chuche" 
ideology. 
  The alliance filed the suit on Jan. 12, 1993.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- On May 18, 1980, the people 
of Kwangju rose up against a group of Army officers who seized 
power for what was to become the Fifth Republic, leading to 
hundreds of citizens being killed or injured in clashes with the 
Army. 
  "The May 18 Kwangju Democratization Movement" marks its 14th 
anniversary this year with a civil movement in place to shed a 
new historical light on the tragic incident. 
  As part of the movement to paint a true picture of the 
incident, dissident groups and some opposition lawmakers are 
moving to file a criminal suit against former Presidents Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and others who allegedly led the Army's 
suppression of the Kwangju uprising, apparently encouraged by 
the Kim Yong-sam government's efforts to "re-evalutate 
historical incidents." 
  These groups formed in March "the national committee looking 
into truths of the May 18 uprising and upholding the uprising's 
spirit" to prepare programs marking the incident's 14th 
anniversary. 
  The committee is comprised of over 300 members representing 
religious, political, academic and journalism circles as well as 
victims of the incident, and the co-chairmen include Christian 
pastors Kang Sin-sok and Kim Sang-kun and Rep. Kim Won-ki of the 
opposition Democratic Party. 
  The committee will hold memorial services on May 12 for 
those 
killed in the uprising at Kwangju's Mangwol-tong cemetery, where 
they now lie in peace, to avoid crowds of visitors on the 
anniversary day. 
  On May 13, the committee will hold a press conference in 
Seoul to demand judicial action against former Presidents Chon 
and No and others accused of killing and injuring Kwangju 
residents during the uprising. 
  It will also call on the government to delve into the truth 
behind the incident, saying President Kim Yong-sam's civilian 
government has not yet shed a full light on the tragedy. 
  After the press conference, representatives of the committee 
will visit the public prosecutor's office to file a criminal 
suit against 34 persons accused of being responsible for the 
deaths and injuries, including former Presidents Chon and No, 
together with a petition signed by Chong Tong-nyon and 319 other 
victims for judicial action against the 34. 
  Rep. Chong Sang-yong of the opposition Democratic Party, who 
sits on the committee, says shedding a new historical light on 
the May 18 Kwangju democratization movement should entail 
punishment of those responsible for the tragedy. 
  The committee will then hold an academic conference in the 
National Assembly on May 14 to re-evaluate the historical 
significance of the Kwangju democratization movement and divulge 
the "fictitiousness" of the Kim Yong-sam government's probe of 
the Army's suppression of the movement. 
  The conference will also deal with the issue of punishing 
those responsible for the armed suppression of the uprising, a 
committee official says. 
  The national committee will focus its 14th anniversary 
programs on a historical re-evaluation of the Kwangju 
democratization movement, with a view to giving it a proper 
position in history, another committee official says.

  [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is to go ahead 
with military improvement and exercise plans in a change of 
stance from when Seoul wanted to avoid any act that could 
provoke North Korea, government sources here said Sunday. 
  Schedule for deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache 
helicopters, for example, will proceed as planned, and so will 
South Korea-U.S. military maneuver "Team Spirit" and arms 
improvement projects, they said. 
  These plans would change, as Seoul said, if North Korea 
returns to negotiations with South Korean Government and if the 
negotiations make progress. 
  But Seoul will separate these plans from the ongoing nuclear 
talks, the sources said. 
  South Korea announced in March that it will no longer demand 
inter-Korean dialogue as a condition to high-level talks between 
North Korea and the United States. It was then that the 
government decided to sever the link between the military plans 
and the nuclear problem, they said. 
  "It's true that we did try to avoid provoking North Korea as 
much as possible," said one official, "But despite such efforts, 
North Korea hasn't given up its nuclear program. It's our 
policy to pursue necessary security measures without linkage to 
the nuclear negotiations. [no closing quotation mark as received]

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Pang-hui: "10 Years of Backward </F>
Movement Owing to Purge"] 
  [Text] The U.S. military technological assistance team 
[TAT], composed of eight U.S. Army generals and civilians, 
visited the ROK in 1985. The advice given by this team 
dispatched by the U.S. Defense Department, after touring ROK 
domestic defense industries for a few days, was indeed shocking. 
The team asserted that the ROK should take its hands off the 
defense industry field because it had no competitive power. 
  The team also noted that the United States could "consider" 
lending to the ROK Government part of the funds required to 
purchase defense industry facilities and to abolish them. Paek 
Yong-hun, president of the Korea Defense Industry Academic 
Society, who guided the team's tour on that occasion, said that 
the time when this advise was given could be described as a 
moment when domestic defense industries were nearly withering 
[kosa]. 
  The ROK's defense industry has been fostered in disregard of 
economic logic, which was used as the only assessment standard 
by the U.S. TAT. The 21 January 1968 incident [North Korean 
guerrilla unit's raiding of presidential offices] and the "Nixon 
doctrine" in 1969 were the events that boosted the development 
of the ROK's defense industry. 
  Since then, President Pak Chong-hui urged relevant areas to 
independently develop weapons for which the ROK had been 
entirely dependent upon the United States in the past. For this, 
the Agency for Defense Development [ADD] was established in 
1970. President Pak Chong-hui and O Won-chol, second senior 
presidential secretary for economic affairs, who led the 
development of the defense industry, linked the defense industry 
development plan with a strategy to develop the heavy chemical 
industry. They also extended enormous financial, tax, and real 
estate special favors to the defense industry sector. 
  As soon as President Chon Tu-hwan came to office, however, 
the brakes were applied to the policy of strongly pushing for 
the development of the defense industry. He did not think highly 
of the defense industry's domestic capabilities for research and 
development and did not sympathize with such necessity. His 
antipathy was clearly expressed through a large-scale dismissal 
of ADD members. Members of this organization, which led the 
development of domestic weapons at that time, numbered about 
3,000. However, 839 were dismissed first, and soon afterward the 
number of dismissed members increased to 1,400. 
  Most of the dismissed researchers were the scientists who 
were engaged in the development of missiles, who President Pak 
personally led with special interest. President Chon used as a 
pretext for the dismissal the fact that the ROK-made missile, 
which was developed with over 100 billion won each year, was 
merely a reproduction of the U.S. Niky Hercules missile. 
  The reason for President Chon Tu-hwan's directive to dismiss 
the ADD researchers can be summarized into following categories: 
First, Kim Chae-ik, senior presidential secretary for economic 
affairs, who was called the "economic president" at that time, 
exerted great influence on the dismissal. He abolished the 
position of second senior presidential secretary for economic 
affairs, who was in charge of the heavy chemical industry and 
defense industry, and openly criticized the excessive investment 
in the defense industry sector. Some people also believe that 
President Chon Tu-hwan was paranoid about the status of this 
research institute, which directly communicated with President 
Pak without going through the military chain of command. 
  On the other hand, most of the victims of the large-scale 
dismissal believed that the United States instigated this 
"large- scale purge." They pointed out that when President Pak 
was in office, the United States was nervous about and 
interfered with the ROK development of nuclear weapons and 
guided missiles. A degree- holding researcher who was dismissed 
at that time stressed: No matter what the reasons may be, the 
large-scale dismissal forced the ROK defense industry technology 
to move backward 10 years. No one can deny this. 
  Since then, the defense industry was treated unkindly 
throughout the Fifth Republic. Nevertheless, it was difficult 
for our government to fully accept the advise of the U.S. TAT 
that the ROK's defense industry should be completely rooted out. 
This being the case, a compromise plan was put forward in the 
form of ROK-U.S. defense industry cooperation. In other words, 
the ROK was to be incorporated with U.S. defense industry firms, 
which gained control of the world's defense industry markets, as 
one of their sub-contractors, instead of competing with them.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Led by blue-chip issues, 
the bull run at the Korean stock exchange pushed share prices 
near the 940-point mark this week. 
  The all-share composite stock price index ended the week at 
936.41, up 27.69 points or 3 percent from a week earlier amid 
heavy trading. 
  Securities experts predict a bullish market this month, 
noting the purchase ratio of institutional investors has hit 46 
percent and daily trade turnover is surpassing 1 trillion won 
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars) these days. 
  The week started off on a strong and healthy note thanks to 
both high- and low-cost shares. The leading index was up 10.54 
points from the weekend to close at 919.26 Monday. 
  Advancers more than doubled retreaters, 528 to 241, with 175 
hitting the daily permissible ceiling as 40 million shares 
changed hands, the most active trading in a month. 
  Amid a hectic tug-of-war between selling and buying, the 
composite index lost 1.71 points to finish at 917.55 Tuesday. 
  Issues of Hyundai affiliates attracted investment on 
expectations of a reconciliation between the business giant and 
the government after the group's honorary chairman, Chong 
Chu-yong, announced his retirement from active business 
management. 
  The index started Wednesday with a gain of 10 points during 
the morning session based on high hopes for improved market 
supply and demand, but profit-taking and anxiety put a brake on 
the bull run. 
  The index instead stopped at 922.33, up 4.78 points on heavy 
trading of 49.9 million shares. 
  Blue-chip issues emerged as popular choices again in the 
Friday session, pushing the index up near 930 points. The 
market was closed on Thursday for children's day, a national 
holiday here. 
  The composite index marched up 5.51 points to reach 927.84, 
due to the popular issues of Daewoo Electronics and Goldstar. 
  Medium- and small-sized issues easily pushed the index above 
930 Saturday despite hectic profit-taking. It ended the week up 
8.57 points at 936.41 as 30.1 million shares changed hands 
during the half-day session.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreigners have done more 
buying than selling in the Korean stock market since last week, 
securities sources said Saturday. 
  Foreigners bought shares worth 176.3 billion won and sold 
127 
billion won in stocks for a net purchase of 49.3 billion won 
between April 24 and Wednesday. 
  During the 10 days, they recorded net sales only on April 26 
at 1.3 billion won and on May 2 at 6.3 billion won. 
  In March, foreigners' net sales totaled 184.2 billion won 
and 
in the first 23 days of April, the figure came to 56.9 billion 
won. 
  Foreigners appear to be buying stocks again in response to 
reports of conspicuous signs of economic recovery and the 
perception that prices in the Seoul bourse have bottomed out.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Samsung business group 
is reportedly tense about potential government disapproval of 
the group's advancement into the car industry. 
  The country's biggest business group is poised to submit its 
contract on technology cooperation with Nissan of Japan to the 
government. If Samsung wins state approval, it can jump into 
the automaking industry. 
  Samsung group chairman Yi Kon-hui suddenly postponed his 
Southeast Asian tour on Sunday and Samsung heavy industries 
officials held an emergency meeting during the weekend to study 
the government's possible moves. 
  "The government had hinted that it wanted us to give up our 
automaking project several times and Chairman Yi's postponement 
of his overseas tour must have something to do with that," a 
Samsung executive said. 
  Senior government officials, offering their own opinions, 
have often told company managers in private that Samsung's entry 
into the auto industry was inappropriate, he said. 
  But Samsung officials say they cannot understand why the 
government is making a series of remarks against its car project 
when the group has not even submitted the technology import 
application yet. 
  Samsung is trying its best to read the government's mind and 
to find out whether the recent remarks reflect its true feelings. 
  If the government's disapproval turns out to be true, the 
group may nevertheless submit its technology import application 
to show it has not given up and will try again. 
  But group moderates say they should get the government's 
message considering it is the country's biggest business group 
and therefore must maintain good relations with the government. 
  Another dilemma for Samsung is whether to announce it is 
giving up the car project before the government officially 
registers its disapproval. 
  Both are painful steps for the group. 
  If it challenges the government by pressing ahead with its 
plans, there is room for the group to fight back if the 
government says no. 
  If it gives up voluntarily, the pride of the business giant 
will be hurt but in the long run, it can expect better relations 
with the government. 
  Samsung is said to be most worried about its status at home 
and abroad. 
  The group has so far put up the invincible image that 
Samsung 
can do anything if it only puts its mind to it. 
  Surrendering its automaking ambitions could also dampen 
Chairman Yi's reform project as well as hurt the company's 
pride, which is exactly why Samsung executives are strongly 
protesting the government's implicit disapproval. 
  One executive questions the government's stress on raising 
the country's competitiveness when at the same time it 
interferes with company activities. 
  He says the government has no legal grounds to disapprove of 
Samsung's automaking project.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The government is expected 
to announce its official position soon on the Samsung business 
group's bid to enter the automobile manufacturing business, it 
was reported Monday. 
  A senior official at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and 
Energy said that Minister Kim Chol-su is scheduled to leave for 
Mexico next Sunday and the government is likely to announce its 
decision on Samsung before he departs. 
  Another official said that as far as he knows, "This problem 
has already been decided." 
  For the sake of formality rather than anything else, he 
added, the government is holding discussions with Samsung and 
the Chamber of Commerce in the southern port of Pusan, where 
Samsung hopes to build car manufacturing plants. 
  Samsung, one of the country's largest conglomerates, plans 
to 
submit for government approval its technology cooperation 
agreement with Nissan Motor Co. of Japan to produce passenger 
cars in Korea.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with MITI Deputy Vice Minister </F>
Sozaburo Okamatsu, University of the Air Vice President Motoo 
Kaji, and Former Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Koichiro Matsuura; moderated by Keidanren Managing Director 
Kazuo Nukazawa, on 4 March: "What the U.S.-Japan Economic Talks 
Have Thrust Before Us"; place not given] 
  [Text] How To Evaluate the Uruguay Round Agreement 
  [Nukazawa] The GATT Uruguay Round reached agreement on 15 
December last year. Looking at developments since then, I think 
there are two issues. The first is: Following conclusion of 
the U.S.-Japan summit on 11 February this year, I feel as if 
some of the Uruguay Round's results have been blown away. Why 
has the world trade atmosphere not improved, even though the 
Uruguay Round reached agreement? Is the United States not fully 
satisfied? Could it be that, because the results on "multi" 
(multilateral) issues were insufficient, domestic pressure was 
brought to bear on the "bi" [bilateral relationship with Japan.] 
  The second issue: In contrast to meetings with global 
objectives such as the Uruguay Round, there are movements such 
as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and the EU 
(European Union). The question is, in particular, how the 
Clinton administration will strategically tackle regional 
groupings such as NAFTA and, at the same time, tie them to APEC 
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). What is your opinion? 
  [Matsuura] I do not think the results of the Uruguay Round 
were blown away. The Uruguay Round has determined establishment 
of a new multifaceted trading system for goods and services. 
The decision to establish the World Trade Organization (WTO) as 
a part of it was a very significant result. As for the 
agreement establishing the WTO, which consolidated the results 
of the Uruguay Round, the target for implementation is 1 July 
1995. But voices are becoming stronger urging a quickening of 
the pace. I hope each country will finish the necessary 
domestic procedures quickly so this agreement will come into 
effect; the WTO will start functioning from 1 July next year 
(sooner if possible); and disputes will be handled 
multilaterally. 
  As for the situation surrounding the current U.S.-Japan 
framework talks, this is occuring during the interim between the 
Uruguay Round and initiation of the WTO. If the Uruguay Round 
had not been concluded it would have been much worse. 
  It is regrettable that the negotiations centering on 
priority 
areas such as government procurement, insurance, and automobiles 
and automobile parts were not concluded by 11 February. But it 
does not mean the negotiations broke down. Although the United 
States came up with such tactics as the resurrection of the 
Super 301 clause, it has not yet decided what it will do to 
implement it. Japan is also trying independently to come up with 
a market-opening policy by the end of March. So, through these 
market opening measures, we need to do everything we can. 
  [Okamatsu] As I look back at the seven years and three 
months since the start of the Uruguay Round negotiations, I 
think that, because GATT was set up to maintain the free 
economic sphere's unity, there was a period of stagnation 
because of the socialist sphere's disintegration. What made 
GATT go forward, however, was the increased regionalism in 
various places. There are NAFTA, the EC, and APEC, and if these 
had been left unchecked, there was the possibility that they 
would have formed blocs. I wonder if the centripetal force 
toward the Uruguay Round was revived because of apprehension 
about the formation of blocs. 
  At the same time, developed countries, with limited 
financial 
and monetary resources for rebuilding the stagnant world 
economy, had great expectations for economic expansion which 
would be derived from establishment of this free trade 
structure. I think this is the first point we must keep in mind 
when we evaluate the Uruguay Round. 
  [Kaji] I thought the Uruguay Round, rather than the 
U.S.-Japan framework talks, would not reach agreement. I think 
it was a very positive thing that the Uruguay Round reached 
agreement, not only for Japan, but also for the entire world 
economy. At a time when GATT was promoting free and 
nondiscriminatory multilateral economic relationships, the 
United States took the lead during the 1960's. But since the 
Tokyo Round in the 1970's, the United States has come to act in 
a not necessarily positive manner. As for the Uruguay Round, 
especially since the Clinton administration began, even among 
economists the theoretical argument has emerged that the benefit 
of free and non-discriminatory multi- lateralism need not be 
guaranteed under all circumstances. As such, there was a fear 
that the United States might stop supporting free trade 
principles. But this did not happen, so the scope for the 
future has opened up. 
<H5>  GATT Going Through Changes </H5>
  [Nukazawa] I see that in the Uruguay Round, agreements were 
made with limited participants. It appears to me that the 
principle of MFN (most favored nation) has been lost. Does this 
mean that GATT has changed? 
  [Matsuura] The GATT was an agreement that had a 
homogeneous economic structure and which was created with the 
advanced industrialized countries at its center. So if I may 
exaggerate, there was essentially no difference between 
reciprocity and MFN. But as developing countries and former 
communist countries began to join GATT, the homogeneous economy 
could no longer control it. In such a situation the use of MFN 
would have been excessive. So regrettably, reciprocity began to 
be favored. Theoretically, it is obvious the use of MFN would 
definitely be better, and with this leverage the United States 
could have utilized all the power it possessed. But U.S. power 
has relatively decreased, and reciprocity began to emerge when 
the United States adopted the idea of "give and take." But I do 
not think it is a good idea to give reciprocity too central a 
role. So in the Uruguay Round this time, we tried to restrain 
reciprocity, especially for the service trade and such, and 
tried to make use of MFN as much as possible. 
  [Okamatsu] That is the fundamental issue concerning GATT. I 
was in Geneva for a week before the final stage of the 
negotiations. I remember that when I met Secretary General 
Sutherland, he asked me: "What do you think of financial 
reciprocity, which the United States is advocating?" I replied: 
"If we accept, it will be the death of GATT itself. Could such 
an idea exist in GATT? If we permit the existence of 
reciprocity which is discriminatory, it will be the end of 
GATT." He said: "I think so, too. I will never accept it." 
  I think agreement was reached in the Uruguay Round this time 
because of the determination, in such a crisis, to try to make 
one more effort for a liberal system. As you pointed out, this 
time quite a few developing countries actively participated. As 
for the lowering of tariffs, which was GATT's original function, 
such countries as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, which in 
the past were not bound, have agreed to be. As for Indonesia, 
it will bind its tariff rates at 91 percent. This is a sign of 
their commitment to the liberal trade system. 
  [Kaji] As Mr. Nukazawa said, the nature of GATT is clearly 
changing. But I feel its fundamental direction as an 
international organization has been maintained and this was 
guaranteed by the agreement. 
  One reason the framework negotiations have turned out the 
way 
they have is that President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa 
are both different from past presidents and prime ministers in 
terms of their position in their respective nation's domestic 
political situation. In the United States Clinton is the first 
president born in the postwar era. Moreover, the international 
economy and the entire range of international relationships have 
changed drastically; all of this contributes to the impulse for 
change. As for the Japanese, the representatives differed from 
those who had been supported by the LDP majority. Such points 
might have been contributing factors for bringing about a very 
unusual situation. 
<H5>  Where the Framework Talks Will Go -- Objective Criteria </H5>
Have Taken Off on Their Own 
  [Nukazawa] About the framework talks: Mr. Kaji, do you also 
take the position that we should not set numerical macroeconomic 
targets? 
  [Kaji] On that point, first, I think that terms such as 
objective criteria and numerical targets took off on their own 
this time. Let us consider the macro indicators and micro 
indicators separately. As for the macro, assume for example, 
the United States were to recall the case of semiconductors and 
argue "we can do something similar again." The Japanese should 
take the position that the semiconductor case was one we should 
never repeat. From the start we thought it was a bad idea to 
consult on the market share of individual products between 
governments. 
  As for macro indicators, when making earlier long-term 
economic plans, in some cases the Japanese Government published 
a numerical projection for the way the international balance 
should be. But since the early 1970's, setting the number has 
become very difficult. One reason is that, because foreign 
exchange has been changed to a floating system, to project 
exports and imports in dollar terms in three to five years has 
become difficult. 
  Another reason is that when the U.S. balance-of-trade 
deficit 
became extremely large and Japan's proportion in it great, the 
reality was that half the deficit was with Japan. This made it 
impossible for Japan to determine the numerical figure by itself. 
  I certainly think the Japanese surplus today is too large. 
It is too large in macroeconomic terms and too large with the 
United States. But it is not good simply to decide 
quantitatively to what extent we should reduce it. That is my 
position. 
  [Matsuura] It is true that when we discuss numerical 
targets, we need to separate macro from micro. As for macro, so 
far as the U.S.-Japan negotiations are concerned, it was settled 
in July 1993. At that time, the United States was also seeking 
numerical indicators for macro--in other words, it wanted our 
global surplus in the current account balance to be reduced by 
half in terms of GDP ratio within three years (3.2 percent for 
1992), or held below 2 percent of GDP. But Japan could not make 
such a commitment, and in the end, we agreed in the medium term 
to reduce the balance of our current account surplus in a 
meaningful way. 
  What is important is that we make steady progress toward 
such 
a goal. Concrete policy measures should be implemented to 
stimulate domestic demand-oriented economic growth, and we 
should make steady progress toward such a medium-term goal by 
adopting a policy to further open markets. 
  The issue is how to handle numerical targets for the micro 
area. At the beginning, the United States sought goals which had 
the characteristics of numerical targets. But its attitude 
changed in midcourse so as not to seek such targets. In fact, 
in his 11 February news conference, President Clinton declared 
the United States would not seek numerical goals. But the 
problem is the United States wants to establish objective 
criteria. In the negotiations, U.S. officials began mentioning 
that quantitative criteria were to be set up within the 
objective criteria to measure progress. But to measure results 
after-the-fact would not work. It meant, from our perspective, 
setting numerical targets first and measuring the state of 
progress accordingly. That was a difference we could not 
overcome until the end. 
  [Nukazawa] When the negotiations began, it was to discuss 
issues limited to areas where government had responsibility 
("government reach"). The opinion of the Japanese private 
sector was that the government had various means available to 
it, such as public investment and so on. But the current 
account balance surplus and GNP movement were not within the 
realm of government responsibility, though this was a fairly 
close call. If we were to make concessions, it should have been 
in the macro area. Public finance authorities, however, would 
not take any action. Things moved no further than their front 
door, where they stopped, so far as they were concerned. But, 
as a result, demands kept being made on the private sector. And 
the emphasis ended up on the micro area, which is far from the 
realm of government responsibility. This is the candid view of 
the private sector. What do you think? 
  [Okamatsu] There are three principles in the framework 
talks. One is that discussion must run in both directions; 
second is that of "government reach"; and third is the principle 
that the results of these talks be mutually and equally 
beneficial under MFN principles. As for objective criteria, 
there was a question if this was in the realm of government 
responsibility. Since government procurement, insurance, and 
automobiles and auto parts were priority areas, we gave priority 
to discussions of these issues. 
  In discussions of these three principles, the argument on 
"government reach" came very much into the open. As for 
government procurement in particular, we agreed that making 
procedures transparent is a government issue. As for insurance, 
deregulation is a government issue. Therefore, we discussed how 
to do these things in a reciprocal manner. 
  As for automobiles and auto parts, which were private sector 
business activities, discussions took place on areas where 
government could have a role. The United States also agreed 
that automobiles and auto parts were in the private realm. But 
there was a different recognition of the arm length of 
government reach. This was in the background of discussions. 
  On this subject, discussion focused on the sphere where 
government could have a role. As a result of this debate, the 
United States stopped mentioning the government's setting 
numerical targets on completed automobiles. 
  As for the private sector setting targets, many scholars, 
both in the United States and Japan, oppose the idea. Moreover, 
there is the question of what this has to do with free trade 
principles in the first place. 
  Also, once a number is set, it takes on a life of its own. 
As a result, it will be viewed as a government commitment. As 
for the presence of a stated number in a U.S.-Japan agreement, 
there is the purchase of auto parts--$19 billion (fiscal year 
1994). But this number was drawn up with utmost caution and 
given as the numerical target for efforts by the private sector. 
Yet, after one year, the United States interpreted this as a 
government commitment and started making arguments accordingly. 
  [Kaji] It is a fact that a great imbalance still exists. I 
understand that, on this point, Japan does not think the status 
quo is good. Therefore, if there is an opportunity, I think the 
relationship can be improved on both sides. 
  Is the Japanese Market Really Closed? 
  [Nukazawa] As for objective criteria, some people in the 
Japanese business sector argue that, since President Clinton 
declared he would not demand a set market share as was the case 
with semiconductors, based on his words, we should take the 
initiative to reopen dialogue. On the other hand, as I read the 
contents of the President's news conference, he touched on some 
five areas, such as import levels, comparison with the other six 
G-7 nations, exchange rate fluctuations, the state of Japanese 
domestic demand, and American business efforts. Two or three of 
these can easily be quantified. So, the United States may not 
demand a market share, but I am apprehensive it will want 
something very close to numerical targets. What do you think? 
  [Matsuura] The United States keeps saying it will not demand 
market share. But it cites objective criteria in concrete 
terms: One is the average market share of the G-7 nations, other 
than Japan, and another is continuation of past trends into the 
future, in connection with which medical equipment, auto parts, 
and so on are mentioned. The idea is to carry the increase in 
past trends up to 25 or 30 percent in the future as one of the 
criteria. Such are the two ideas. 
  Thus, if what President Clinton said was true, Japan has 
also 
made concrete proposals concerning government procurement and 
even made amended proposals at the final stage. I think 
President Clinton's comments at the news conference by and large 
matched our proposals on government procurement. We need to 
refine them further in the future. 
  [Okamatsu] Their theory goes as follows: Japan has a $120 
billion trade surplus. Compared to Europe, the market share for 
American products in Japan is low; that is because the Japanese 
market is closed. Looking at past agreements, with some 
exceptions, positive results are not in evidence. The reason 
why results were not achieved is because only a process was 
prescribed and results were not. The whole setup is designed to 
deter progress. Therefore, in light of the foregoing theory, 
this time around we must establish some mechanism to measure 
progress and pry open the Japanese market. 
  In rebuttal, we say: First, the global imbalance is derived 
from the investment-savings imbalance. Japan will certainly try 
to improve on this point, but the United States must also try to 
reduce its fiscal deficit. 
  Concerning the comparison of market share for some specific 
products, the argument that, compared to other markets, the 
Japanese market is closed is not based on sound theory, because 
the supply structure and demand structure are totally different 
for each market. 
  Second, about past agreements. These are classified into 
three types: The first is deregulation. We have complied with 
the agreements, the market has been opened, and imports have 
increased. 
  The second is our attempts on open procedures. This is for 
government procurements. We have pledged we would simplify 
procedures on items such as supercomputers and computers; we are 
enforcing this. The market will determine what the outcome is. 
  The third is cooperation in the private sector. This must be 
settled in the future through the efforts of both sides. It is 
not rational to say that, because success is not visible now, 
results have not been obtained. 
  I am rebutting the structure of the argument, but the 
question is how we overcome such fundamental misconceptions. 
Will the way be opened by comments such as those President 
Clinton made? But U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Kantor's 
comments at negotiations had a different nuance. I wonder if 
they have an unambiguous policy within that administration. 
During the negotiations, we had repeated difficulties because 
of this. 
  [Kaji] It is natural that in past negotiations, processes 
were agreed on but results not obtained. Results would emerge 
as the consequence of market movement and economic rationality, 
and the economic mechanism would not guarantee that the results 
would be the same as the G-7 average. Here, the American 
thinking is wrong. 
  But still, I cannot help but admit there are various 
regulations in Japan. I think there are many products which 
could enter if we relaxed regulations. Many people also 
fervently advocate deregulation for the sake of the domestic 
economy. I think it would be best if we take bold steps on 
deregulation. 
  [Nukazawa] It would also be good if domestic demand were 
expanded. About the summit meeting: The evaluation of the 
Europeans was that it was natural for Japan to say no to 
numerical targets. But the Japanese surplus was a problem, so 
domestic demand should be expanded. That is my reading. GATT 
Secretary General Sutherland said he was opposed to numerical 
targets and the use of Super 301. What is the reaction in Asia? 
  [Matsuura] The reaction in Asia is basically the same as 
in Europe, but the nuances are different. In Europe, when I met 
with the EC Committee members headed by Committee Chairman 
Delors on 14 February, they said they evaluated Japan 
positively, first of all for not going along with bilateralism. 
However, they did not want the United States and Japan to start 
a trade war and wanted us to avoid this by any means. Also, 
they wanted Japan, which holds such a large current account 
surplus, to do better in the macro area. 
  The Asian countries have similar feelings, and they too 
evaluate the first point highly. But at the same time, they 
feel that if Japan and the United States got into a full-scale 
trade war, Asian countries would become entangled, and this 
would have a very negative effect. So they want this to be 
avoided by any means. 
<H5>  Theory of Japanese Differentness </H5>
  [Nukazawa] Representative Kantor says: "Japan is a very 
unique and different country," and "the market is the most 
closed." Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten also gave a 
speech at Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] 
(3 March) saying: "I have visited Asian countries where I have 
told each of them Japan is the most closed country in Asia. 
Therefore, we have assumed the kind of policy we have toward 
Japan, but we will not assume such a policy toward other 
countries in Asia." Is Japan really that different? 
  [Okamatsu] I think they are judging Japan to be so different 
based on statistics. It is true that, when I look at market 
shares, some individual products have gained no share in the 
Japanese market. But this is determined by each country's 
supply and demand structure. And moreover, even if the volume 
of all import products is small, we must consider systems and 
geography. The United States shares land borders with Canada, 
which is an almost equally industrialized country. Europe has a 
system called the EU, and moreover, it is all connected by land 
borders. Such a system does not exist for Japan. And another 
factor is that Japan is an island nation. We must keep this in 
mind. 
  Therefore, when we include all these factors in our 
calculations, the ratio of imports compared to GNP is not all 
that different from other countries. 
  Other countries' citing such indicators and declaring that 
we 
are different rubs us the wrong way. But does it mean that we 
can maintain the present situation? That is not the case. 
There are some aspects on which we must frankly reflect and 
reexamine ourselves. 
  As for the industrial sector, considering the recent high 
yen, we must work to expand new dealings which would exceed old 
transaction relationships. In other words, if we find products 
which are cheap and useful, we should also include them in the 
process of sorting out Japanese products. Or enterprises will 
start to think about export projects. These efforts and 
deregulation of the system by the government will gradually 
change the environment. 
  [Nukazawa] Dornbusch (Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
professor) and some revisionists have been saying that the ratio 
of imported products to Japanese GNP is extremely low compared 
to that of other G-7 countries. Can the fact that the so-called 
intra-industry trade index is extremely low be evidence the 
market is closed? 
  [Kaji] I do not think that is the case, since each country 
has its own demand and supply structure. If countries become 
united as Europe is, the trade ratio will naturally go up. And 
the argument that a country is different based on differences in 
numerical results is not the same as the original theory of 
difference which Chalmers Johnson and others put forward. The 
original theory of difference was a theory that noted the 
difference in the connection of political and economic 
relationships or differences in social arrangements. The 
Dornbusch argument says we are different because results are 
different. 
  [Matsuura] The United States has been saying the Japanese 
market is the most closed of G-7 members. On this, two measures 
are cited: The ratio of imports to GNP and the rate of 
investment in foreign countries. The United States says that 
those indicators for Japan are extremely low. In Asia, with the 
exception of Hong Kong and Singapore, it is obvious Japan is far 
more open than other countries. The problem is that it is very 
difficult to make a comparison to the degree of openness within 
the G-7. But it does not make sense to make comparisons using 
only these two indexes. So, if we are compared to the United 
States, it is true that overall it is far more open. But I 
cannot agree that we are the most closed of the G-7 members. 
  [Okamatsu] As for investment, arguments have been raised 
about that recently, so I investigated it. When the amount of 
U.S. investment in major manufacturing industries is compared to 
that of Japan and the major European countries, there is no 
substantial difference in the actual amount. Therefore, we can 
say that there may be a gap developing in the other areas, but 
as for the major manufacturing industries, U.S. investment is 
similar to ours. 
  [Nukazawa] Because Japan keeps saying "market opening, 
market opening," others think the protected market remains in 
place, is that not it? 
  [Matsuura] Still, it is true that there remain further 
measures which we must take. Those are the so-called 
traditional trade barriers. The number of nontariff barriers 
has come down, but the number of items still requiring a permit 
is said to be 11,000. We need to examine how much impact these 
have on trade. 
  How Will a Multinational Trade Framework and 
Bilateral Negotiations Be Harmonized? 
  [Nukazawa] When a dispute-handling mechanism in GATT already 
exists--and is being further improved--why are so many bilateral 
negotiations taking place? Is it not better to strengthen 
organizations such as GATT which deal with multiple nations? 
Some people offer the criticism that bilateral negotiations 
between the United States and Japan will have a hollowing effect 
on GATT. 
  [Matsuura] I think we should basically manage trade with 
multilateral organizations; we should utilize GATT and then the 
WTO [World Trade Organization] as much as possible. But when 
the other side approaches us bilaterally, we cannot flatly 
refuse to respond, especially since at the bottom of U.S. 
frustration with us is the huge trade deficit. But the Japanese 
response should persistently stick by principles, and complete 
bilateralism must be eliminated. 
  [Okamatsu] I think that when there is some dispute between 
two countries they should move their case onto the multilateral 
stage. When the United States unilaterally applied Super 301 in 
connection with the semiconductor issue, we heatedly discussed 
whether or not we should go to GATT. But at that time, the 
situation in Japan was such that we were not ready to go to 
GATT. I think the time has come that, when an issue arises, we 
should manage it at the multilateral level rather than in a 
bilateral context--that should be regarded as the basic response. 
  When the parties appeal to GATT, first, a bilateral 
conference takes place. There is a rule that when no agreement 
is reached, a neutral third party will pass judgment. I think 
one way of responding would be to utilize such a solution for 
future disputes. 
  [Kaji] You are right. The principle is that we talk 
bilaterally while keeping in mind the global implications or the 
effect on the entire world. I think it would be sensible for us 
not to stubbornly insist only on the multilateral level, and 
that we seek a solution bilaterally when the bilateral 
significance is very important. 
  [Nukazawa] Some people offer criticism that the United 
States will act both as prosecutor and judge when we negotiate 
with sanctions in the background, because there are no set rules 
to begin with. 
  [Matsuura] You are correct that there are people who 
criticize unilateral measures taken by the United States, such 
as application of Super 301. But does it mean multilateral 
action such as GATT's is enough? As I witnessed the U.S.-Japan 
negotiations on electronic communications and medical 
technology, I think it is understandable why the United States 
does not feel that regulatory actions by GATT are sufficient and 
seeks something additional. That is why we had detailed 
negotiations. 
  GATT's action is quite elastic. It says that the approach A 
is taking is all right and so are those by B and C. It is 
understandable that the United States wants something with a 
somewhat more strict direction. 
  [Nukazawa] But as other countries see it, they must want the 
United States to correct matters such as the protection of 
maritime transportation and the grandfather clause (agriculture 
protection). 
  [Mtsuura] Exactly. From the outset, the United States held 
back on maritime transportation in the negotiations on services. 
So Japan and other countries were very unhappy about this 
point. The United States also has its own problems. 
  [Nukazawa] In that case, in world trade, everything that 
inconveniences the United States is quickly improved, but even 
if something is caused by a deficiency of GATT, improvements are 
hardly made on issues where the United States does not suffer 
much. I feel it is so unfair. 
  [Okamatsu] The WTO has been created, but still, we cannot 
solve everything there. First, as to dispute contents, we can 
appeal an infringement of interest which falls under the 
competence of the WTO. As for elements which do not fall into 
this category, the situation is different. For instance, if 
Japan makes some special pledge during future U.S.-Japan 
negotiations, then the special regulation or some individual 
contract rather than general regulations will take precedence, 
even when we take the case to GATT. 
  Moreover, from now on among the cases brought, a 
determination will have to be made on whether the retaliatory 
measure being challenged comes under WTO regulations or is 
outside of it. So, if we are hit with retaliatory measures 
outside the competence of the WTO, there would be nothing we 
could do. Therefore, the WTO is not all mighty. 
  So in that sense, we must uphold the abovementioned great 
principles. But, at the same time, bilateral issues will remain 
in the future, and naturally we must adhere to bilateral 
agreements which decide the trade relationship of two countries. 
  Where Will the Free Trade System Go--Prospects for 
Post-Uruguay Round 
  [Nukazawa] Regarding the Uruguay Round, in order to turn 
every country into the same economic society, the harmonization 
of competition, environment, and trade policies and so on will 
emerge as the big issues. Do you have any suggestions in this 
regard? 
  [Matsuura] The issues you just mentioned mainly concern 
trade and environment, but there are others: Trade and science 
and technology, trade and labor, and trade and investment. 
Although the recent Uruguay Round took up a wide range of 
issues, there are still more which have not been taken up. 
  The Tokyo Round concluded in 1979 and the Uruguay Round 
began 
in 1986; there was a gap of seven years. The question is how to 
link this Uruguay Round to the next round. Will we take up 
individual issues such as trade and environment, rather than 
conduct a large-scale round? Or will we include everything and 
try for another big round? If it were to be big round, it would 
make fairly tough demands on the developing countries on those 
single issues. To bring the developing countries along, the 
developed countries must be ready to give up something at the 
next round. Altogether 117 countries participated this time, 
and 87 of them are developing countries. We must give careful 
consideration to the question of how to gain a consensus from 
these 87 countries at the next round. 
  [Okamatsu] The discussion of specific issues mentioned above 
has already taken place at the OECD or GATT. And I think 
discussions of environment and investment issues in particular, 
are advancing. Because of the strong interest in environment 
issues, some even say the next round will be the Green Round. 
  Environmental policies, however, are naturally determined by 
each country's history, society, or developmental stage, so it 
is not right to squeeze the developing counties with the 
developed countries' standard of environmental policy. Beside, 
when you speak of the environment, there are global 
environmental issues and local pollution issues for specific 
countries. We must be mindful of these distinctions when we 
discuss them. Otherwise, negotiations which would put unfair 
burdens on developing countries would not be realized as 
negotiations. 
  As for the issue of the environment and trade policy, in the 
past there have been faulty trade policies which were colored by 
environmental considerations. In that regard, what we are 
advocating about the environment is, first, the absence of 
discrimination between domestic and international measures, in 
accordance with domestic measures. Second, we should adopt a 
policy which involves the least "distortion" for trade. Even 
when we adopt measures for the environment, we must choose ones 
which have the least effect on trade policy. Further, the 
choice must be based on an international agreement on the 
environment, not merely determined by the interests of some 
specific country. 
  Another point: An argument arose for reevaluating NAFTA 
concerning environmental and labor issues. It is good reference 
to note how the United States dealt with the possible problem of 
a substantial amount of goods produced under low wages and low 
environmental standards in Mexico entering the United States. 
It was dealt with as follows: First the United States 
established the principle of honoring current Mexican 
sovereignty, examined its structure, and judged it satisfactory. 
But the United States will monitor the situation to ensure that 
practices are actually followed. If there are any problems, 
consultations between the two countries will be held to seek a 
solution. 
  [Nukazawa] I think every country has a stage which Charles 
Johnson called the "developmental state." As Alexander 
Hamilton's time in the United States was an era of industrial 
policy, every country has experienced such a phase in order to 
arrive at its present-day stage. If developing countries are 
told that they are not permitted to have such a stage, they will 
have difficulty achieving growth. I wonder if the developing 
countries might not have trouble obtaining growth if they are 
levied with the task of homogenizing too rapidly. 
  [Kaji] That is a difficult issue. GATT started with tariffs 
and trade, and has gradually expanded to include services and 
investment; now, it is even covering the environment. I think 
GATT will provide a powerful platform if it is utilized 
appropriately. But it will not function well unless some 
countries demonstrate leadership. 
  But the issues which will be taken up in the future will be 
ones for which guarantees of mutual interests will be difficult. 
As for trade, it is the situation that 99 out of 100 economists 
would agree that free trade is in the interests of the country 
concerned. But as for movement in capitals, quite a few will 
have reservations. Furthermore, when environmental 
considerations come into play, it is going to be difficult to 
guarantee that there will be common interests. That is why I am 
somewhat worried that progress on future issues will not be 
achieved in as "clear cut" a manner as was the case with trade 
and tariffs. 
  [Nukazawa] Each country's economy has been formed from 
the background of its design as a country, national 
characteristics, and culture. One after another, each country 
has contributed to the history of world civilization. But if we 
are too eager to make them all homogeneous, then some 
interesting and different "DNA" might be lost. For living 
things, the preservation of diversity is necessary. 
  [Matsuura] As economic relationships have become so close 
and relationships of mutual dependency have increased, it is 
insufficient to focus only on tariff and nontariff barriers 
which are beachhead measures. In that regard, it is 
understandable that an argument would emerge along the lines 
that we should "harmonize" economic structures as much as 
possible because fairness will otherwise not be maintained. 
  [Okamatsu] It provokes our antipathy when the theory of 
differentness is used. Following recognition that every country 
is different, then exchange and trade start. If all countries 
become the same, then it will result, in a way, in a parallel 
situation. I think, however, that there must be some way to 
seek "harmonization"--economic "harmony"--while still preserving 
the virtuous aspects of differences. 
  [Nukazawa] Then, do you mean that a sense of balance rather 
than a legal approach is important now? 
  [Kaji] As you all know, rivalry between the two systems has 
not disappeared. In other words, it is safe to say that the 
central/directed economic structure has lost. But now, various 
differences within the former Western side have become evident, 
and the economic differences of each country are showing up. 
Here, in fact, an economy motivated by the market mechanism is 
fundamentally functioning in most countries. So, in letting 
differences remain, we should fundamentally pursue the free 
economy. I think that, as for the macroeconomic management of 
each country, most nations have a fiscal and monetary policy, 
albeit while following the free economic principle. 
Coordination of all this will also remain a future task. I 
think that international cooperation at the macro level and the 
functioning of the market mechanism at the micro level will be 
important. 
  Then, all will mutually recognize that the minor differences 
of each country--I intentionally call them minor 
differences--remain different. Situations have changed today 
when compared to those 30 years ago even in the same country. 
The United States and Japan have seen changes. And Europe has 
changed even more. So rather than compare the differences, it is 
better to recognize the greater similarities. 
  [Nukazawa] Japan is said "not to have changed," but last 
year for instance, the Administrative Procedure Registration Law 
was passed and enforcement will begin in October 1994. If the 
Japanese government, in response to a request by the U.S. 
government, were to give the business administrative guidance, 
and if this were administrative guidance in violation of GATT, 
it would become extremely difficult for the Japanese government 
to give such administrative guidance in violation of the treaty 
when industry asks for written guidance rather than oral. 
  When I told an American that the business response would be 
different because litigation would be brought by stockholder 
representatives with the complaint: "Why did you follow 
noncompulsory and oral administrative guidance? You caused the 
firm X amount of losses. You, as management, must personally 
pay the firm for the loss incurred," he understood the idea. 
The structure of Japanese industry and government is gradually 
going through change. Yet Americans in general seem to believe 
things are the same as in the past. 
  [Okamatsu] It is significant that the Japanese position in 
the world has changed from that of 30 years ago and of 10 years 
ago. It is the case that one behaves without noticing one's own 
height. This is something we must keep in mind. 
  I have been a government official for over 30 years. Today 
the Japanese position in international conferences is totally 
different from what it was when I started out. As a 
consequence, we must be aware of the weight of our comments and 
of our responsibility. We Japanese as a whole must deal with 
such a situation with self-awareness from now on. 
  [Matsuura] I totally agree. When we are working on bilateral 
negotiations, we tend to forget Japanese significance in world 
society. But it becomes apparent in multinational negotiations. 
That is why last year, when Japan chaired the G-7 Tokyo summit, 
we felt that very strongly. The Japanese presence was very 
different between the first and second Tokyo summits. But the 
Japanese presence has grown further compared to the second 
summit held in Japan in 1986, both in the G-7 and in 
international society. We must recognize the fact that our 
responsibility has increased, and the number of things Japan 
must do is rapidly increasing. 
  [Nukazawa] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Japan and the United States have consolidated the 
contents of an agreement on "cooperation regarding development 
of private-sector industrial technologies." The possibility of 
promoting cooperation was studied at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. The details of this agreement indicate that 
the Japanese and U.S. Governments will select 10 topics such as 
development of materials for producing semiconductors and 
development of carbon fibers, and start joint research this 
fall. The governments of both countries will sign the agreement 
in early June. They will promote cooperation mainly in the area 
of utilizing military technologies to produce civilian goods by 
combining U.S. military technologies with Japanese technologies 
for production of nonmilitary goods. Both governments will ask 
private industry in their own countries to take part in the 
cooperation. 
  It is expected that Eijiro Hata, minister of international 
trade and industry, and Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown--who 
will attend the East and West economic officials' meeting 
scheduled to be held in Warsaw, Poland, from 6 May--will agree 
on an outline of the cooperation. 
  At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks held in 
Washington, Japan and the United States disagreed over the issue 
of objective criteria, including numerical targets, and failed 
to reach an agreement in three areas; government procurement, 
insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts. However, 
both countries agreed to promote "cooperation from the viewpoint 
of global prospects," such as population and environmental 
issues. As one field of "cooperation between the two countries 
in the area of ultramodern technology," both countries, as 
stated in the Washington agreement, were scheduled to have 
detailed discussions to finalize contents of cooperation in 
private-sector industrial technology. 
  Four proposals of the 10-point plan will be implemented 
first. They are applications of nitride aluminum, which is used 
for tank armor plating and other purposes; applications of 
carbon fiber composite material, which is used to produce 
structural materials for space shuttles and aircraft, and for 
production of nonmilitary goods; application of environmental 
technologies for treatment of factory waste fluids and noise 
prevention; and structural analysis of proteins. 
  In addition to these four proposals, other projects to 
promote technological cooperation have also been mentioned. 
Among them are plans to develop a factory automation (FA) 
system by using the target-tracking device on missiles with 
machine tools to achieve highly sophisticated factory 
automation, and to develop an LCD device to be used for 
high-definition televisions. 
  Both countries will improve development efficiencies by 
combining U.S. military technologies and Japanese application 
technologies. Ultimately, they plan to promote joint 
development for all proposals in the 10-point development plan. 
  The U.S. Government intends to send a joint study group 
composed of both government officials and private-sector 
personnel to Japan in June, and hopes that a final agreement can 
be reached on cooperation in research work. Following the 
investigation team's trip to Japan, Japan and the United States 
will establish a joint project team composed of members of state 
research institutes, and start research as early as this fall on 
each proposal. Through the New Energy Development Organization 
(NEDO), which is a corporation having a special status, the 
Japanese Government will ask private corporations to join the 
plan.

<F P=106> [By Siti Rahil] </F>
  [Text] Singapore, May 7 KYODO -- In a rare meeting with a 
U.S. congressman at her home last February, Myanmar's [Burma's] 
detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said she would never 
leave her homeland even if the ruling State Law and Order 
Restoration Council (SLORC) releases her. 
  In a full transcript obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, the 
48-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate told Congressman Bill 
Richardson, "they tried to pressure me to leave the country with 
ways no self- respecting government should employ." 
  Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for more than four 
years since July 1989, added, "there was no such move to have a 
dialogue with me. They only wanted to talk about the terms of 
my departure from the country." 
  Richardson had pressed hard for the meeting when he met 
Myanmar's political and military strongman Khin Nyunt in Yangon 
[Rangoon] in August. 
  During the three-hour interview, Richardson said, "I want 
you 
to know that in my meeting this morning with Khin Nyunt, I 
pushed for the unconditional release of you and all political 
prisoners. I also pushed for a transition to democracy." 
  He added, "I plan to ask the SLORC to release political 
prisoners to me. I want to give them a chance to leave Burma 
with me if they so choose." 
  Suu Kyi, however, firmly insisted that political dissidents 
should stay put in Myanmar. 
  "The only thing I have refused is to discuss leaving the 
country," she said. "I am needed here. Moreover, the principle 
of trying to drive someone out of their own country is totally 
unacceptable." 
  She also said, "please keep making demands on the (ruling) 
SLORC. International pressure does have an effect." 
  On four years of her house arrest, Suu Kyi said, "I do not 
recognize the legitimacy of the law under which I'm being held 
-- it is totally unjust." 
  She recounted that when she was first put under house 
arrest, 
she was not allowed to even offer food to monks, a deed expected 
of devout Buddhists. 
  But, she said, "isolation is not difficult for me. Maybe 
it's because of my Buddhist upbringing. I have books to read 
and a radio to listen to." 
  She sticks to a rigid routine, waking up just before dawn to 
meditate, exercise and do household chores, and goes to bed 
before 10 P.M. She keeps in touch with the outside world mainly 
through the BBC and has read hundreds of books and biographies 
on politics, philosophy, religion and international affairs. 
  Regarding her financial situation she said, "I get part of 
the royalties from my book. They come in foreign currency, 
which I can change into foreign exchange certificates," she said. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES has earlier reported the main points of 
the interview because its reporter was allowed to accompany 
Richardson.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The United Nations atomic 
watchdog has asked the Japanese Government to reconfirm the 
amount of plutonium held up in processing equipment of a 
Japanese nuclear fuel fabrication plant after learning the 
amount was unexpectedly high, sources said Monday [9 May]. 
  The sources said a massive 70 kilograms of plutonium was 
held 
up at the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
facility in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, over the past five and a 
half years since the plant started operations. The fact has 
alerted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since such 
a large amount of plutonium held up in the plant could hamper 
effective application of safeguards against unauthorized 
diversions of plutonium, the sources said. 
  A corporation spokesman stressed, however, that employees at 
the facility have confirmed the existence of the plutonium 
through measurements done with special equipment and denied the 
plutonium in question is unaccounted for. But the sources said 
the IAEA is concerned that any discrepancy in calculations could 
compromise its purpose as a body established to regulate the use 
of nuclear fuel and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. 
  The facility, which began operations in October, 1988, 
supplies fuel to the fast breeder reactor Monju on the Sea of 
Japan coast in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. 
  Sources within the nuclear power industry said that in 
April, 
the IAEA requested that the government confirm whether the 
amount of plutonium held up in the plant actually matched the 
corporation's own measurement. 
  Equipment to monitor plutonium amounts in the facility was 
jointly developed by the corporation and the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in the U.S. state of New Mexico. 
  A measurement by the equipment is believed to have a margin 
of error of 5-10 percent, which means that if the amount of 
held-up plutonium is as much as 70 kilograms, enough plutonium 
to make an atomic bomb could easily escape detection. 
  Paul Leventhal, president of the nongovernmental 
Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute said 70 kilograms is 
more than the amount of plutonium North Korea is alleged to have 
secretly diverted from its own nuclear facilities. Leventhal 
said there is no proof Japan is diverting plutonium for a 
weapons program, but called on the IAEA to closely regulate the 
Japanese facility to ensure fair treatment for all countries 
using nuclear power. 
  In a letter dated May 4 to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Leventhal calls for the shutting down of the 
facility. 
  Leventhal told Christopher the 70 kilograms, about 10 
percent 
of the annual plutonium output at the plant, is "an astounding 
figure." 
  "Under the circumstances, Japan should be prepared 
voluntarily to suspend operation of the plant in the interest of 
its often-stated commitment to the complete transparency of the 
peaceful nature of its plutonium program," Leventhal wrote. 
  A spokesman for the Science and Technology Agency's 
safeguards division said the IAEA and the government gauge the 
amount of plutonium held up in the plant once every month, and 
added it is impossible to divert the plutonium from the facility.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 6 KYODO -- Japan will soon reply to 
U.S. demands for further proposals to reduce its heavy trade 
surplus, Japan's trade minister promised U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Ron Brown in a meeting in Warsaw on Friday [6 May]. 
  Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro 
Hata and Brown had a brief talk while they were here for a 
meeting of economic, industry and trade ministers from the Group 
of Seven (G-7) industrialized states and 10 former East Bloc 
nations. 
  Brown expressed a wish to reach a common understanding with 
Japan on the three points raised by U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor in Marrakech last month -- that Japan take steps 
on both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels and set "objective 
criteria" to reduce its trade surplus, Japanese officials said. 
  Such an understanding is a prerequisite to the resumption of 
talks with Japan on a new bilateral trade framework, the U.S. 
secretary said, according to the officials. 
  Hata replied that he understands the importance of the three 
points and Japan wishes to see the issue settled in a way that 
would not lead to "managed trade," the officials said. 
  The Japanese minister indicated that efforts will be made to 
resume the trade framework talks ahead of an upcoming summit 
meeting of the G-7 countries in Naples, Italy, in July. 
  In a separate meeting with Russian Deputy Premier Aleksandr 
Shokhin the same day, Hata said Japan will continue support for 
Russia in its efforts for reform.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan has not yet made any 
breakthrough with the United States to reopen the stalled 
"framework" trade talks, a senior Finance Ministry official said 
Monday [9 May]. 
  "Foreign Ministry officials are seeking possibilities 
through 
various channels, but there seems to be no clear direction yet," 
Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news conference. 
But he reiterated that substantial progress has been made in 
insurance which his ministry is in charge of negotiating among 
the three priority areas under the framework talks. 
  Other areas are automobiles and auto parts, and government 
procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment. 
  In a related development, a senior Foreign Ministry official 
said Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa may visit the United States 
in late May or early June for talks with U.S. officials on ways 
to resume the framework talks. 
  "I hope that working-level talks will be resumed by the 
Middle of this month," the official, who declined to be named, 
told reporters. 
  The official said Kakizawa hopes to meet with U.S. leaders 
to discuss other delicate issues such as the suspected nuclear 
weapons development program by North Korea. 
  The official also said Kakizawa is likely to meet U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in Paris when they attend a 
ministerial session of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) opening June 7.

<F P=106> ["What is `Rimpac' Aimed At?" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- It is very ill-boding 
that the U.S. imperialists, Japanese reactionaries and South 
Korean puppets are going to stage the "Rimpac" war exercises in 
concert openly, while intensifying their conspiracy and tieup in 
an effort to stifle the DPRK on the pretext of its fictitious 
"nuclear issue", says a MINJU CHOSON commentary today, which 
reads in part: 
  The U.S. imperialists are threatening the DPRK by shipping 
into South Korea Patriot missiles and other sophisticated 
combat equipment and ceaselessly staging war exercises, big and 
small, vociferating about "international sanctions" and 
"military countermove" against the DPRK. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and other U.S.-toeing forces, 
too, 
are joining them by clamoring for "international cooperation 
system". The South Korean puppet clique broke down talks with 
the North and are leaving no stone unturned, as a shock-force, 
to stifle the fellow countrymen with the backing of outside 
forces. 
  At a time like this, the United States, Japan and South 
Korea 
are trying to stage a large-scale joint war gamble. It is only 
too clear what they seek through the gamble. 
  It proves that the U.S., Japan and South Korean 
reactionaries 
are intending to contain the DPRK militarily through their 
conspiracy and tieup under the cloak of "international 
cooperation system" and, to this end, they are substantiating 
their criminal triangular military alliance. 
  The United States and its followers are trying to destroy 
the 
DPRK, the bulwark of socialism, by driving the situation on the 
Korean peninsula into extremes militarily, but it is a foolish 
idea. 
  Should the United States and its followers persist in 
straining the situation on the Korean peninsula by staging 
"Rimpac" joint war exercises, they would be held wholly 
responsible for grave consequences arising therefrom.

  [Text] According to a military source, on 5 May the U.S. 
imperialists staged a provocative nocturnal aerial surprise 
strike exercise over the sea aimed at a Northward invasion. 
This frantic war exercise was staged on a large scale, which 
was waged in the air over the sea off Kangnung from around 1900 
to around 2200, using pursuit-assault planes and vertical 
takeoff and landing assault plane squadrons from U.S. Pacific 
area bases; and fighter bombers, assault planes, and observation 
planes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea. 
  E-3 early warning planes serving as an aerial flight command 
post, which had flown into U.S. occupation Air Force bases in 
South Korea prior to this war exercise, directed a comprehensive 
command of the aircraft mobilized for aerial surprise strike 
exercises over the sea, flying around in the air over the 
operational area on that night. 
  This war exercise was like playing with fire aimed at 
increasing the capabilities for actual warfare for nocturnal 
aerial surprise strikes over the sea for a Northward invasion 
under the command of E-3 early warning planes. 
  In the meantime, two KC-135 refueling planes from an 
overseas 
base were mobilized in the air over the sea off Kunsan that 
night for a double flight over Anma Island and Woeyon Island, 
conducting midair refueling for several tens of fighter bombers, 
assault planes, and observation planes mobilized for the 
nocturnal aerial war exercise. 
  This war maneuver fully reveals that the U.S. imperialists 
are recklessly running amok to realize their attempt to launch a 
surprise aerial preemptive strike against the Northern part of 
the Republic.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out the 
extradition of Chat Thai Party MP Thanong Siriprichapong to the 
United States to face charges of drug trafficking. Chuan said 
Thailand would prosecute its own citizens and would not 
extradite them to face charges in foreign countries. 
  The US Embassy in Bangkok announced on Wednesday that on 
January 12, 1993, it requested the Thai government to serve 
legal notice on Thanong that he was the subject of assets 
forfeiture proceedings before the US District Court in northern 
California. 
  "By principles, we will not extradite Thais to be prosecuted 
overseas," Chuan said. "Extradition will be made only against 
foreigners who commit wrongdoings abroad and try to hide out in 
our country. (The United States) may request us to extradite 
(Thanong) but we will not do it. No matter what wrongdoing he 
might have committed, it is Thai officials' responsibility to 
prosecute him." 
  Thanong, a Nakhon Phanom MP, is accused by the US Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA) of having conspired to smuggle more 
than 45 tons of marijuana into the United States between 1977 
and 1987. The US Embassy said the drug deals earned Thanong 
more than $10 million. 
  Chuan said yesterday he had ordered Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri to find out the full details of the charges. 
  The prime minister said the authorities were required to 
follow up the case and find out whether the opposition MP had 
committed crimes as charged. 
  Chuan said the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) 
might 
have been pursuing the case but did not yet have enough evidence 
to take legal action against Thanong. 
  "It is difficult to take action against someone if there 
isn't enough evidence," Chuan said. 
  Prasong met Chuan at Government House at 11.25 am yesterday. 
  Emerging from the meeting, Prasong told reporters he had 
briefed the prime minister over Thanong's case. 
  Prasong said the US government had so far not requested that 
Bangkok extradite Thanong. He said the DEA only wanted the 
government to inform Thanong about the seizure of his assets in 
the US. 
  Thanong had the right to choose whether or not to appear 
before the US court. 
  National Security Council Secretary-General Charan 
Kunlawanit 
said police would find out more information about the alleged 
drug trade. 
  Police Director General Pratin Santipraphop said police were 
monitoring the case but could not take any action because there 
were no evidence against Thanong. Pratin said police had yet to 
get evidence against Thanong from the United States. 
  Meanwhile, Charan Phakdithanakun, secretary-general of the 
Judicial Affairs Division of the Justice Ministry, said 
yesterday the Thai-US extradition treaty does not oblige Bangkok 
to extradite Thai citizens at US requests. He said the treaty 
would normally apply to foreign criminals who escaped to 
Thailand. 
  In case of Thanong, Charan said the Thai authorities could 
take action against him if the alleged drug smuggling took place 
after September 27, 1991, the day a new Thai narcotics 
suppression law went into effect.

country's security. This was the assessment made by Senator 
Orlando Mercado, chairman of the Senate Committee on Defense, 
and Arturo Enrile, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines. 
  However, they expressed the hope that the prevailing tension 
would be solved by moves undertaken by the countries claiming 
the Spratlys. They added that the talks for a joint development 
of the Spratlys would help to prevent the dispute ending in 
violent confrontation. 
  [Begin recording in progress, in English] [Mercado] ...and 
the world, really, as a consequence of the demise of the Cold 
War. But, it is also an accepted notion that Spratlys or 
Kalayaan Island Group is a potential problem. 
  [Enrile] ...flashpoint is Spratlys which is (?unabated) 
because I think everybody has agreed anyway that you know 
diplomacy is still the best way to solve international disputes. 
There is really no conflict there right now, but just to 
anticipate any conflict. [end recording]

  [Text] At a 5 May press conference, our Foreign Ministry 
spokesperson answered questions from national and foreign 
correspondents. 
  AFP and ITAR-TASS correspondents asked: Please inform us of 
Vietnam's reaction to the results of the South African election; 
the election of Mr. Nelson Mandela as president of the Republic 
of South Africa. 
  Answer: Vietnam welcomes the results of the South African 
election; the victory of the ANC and the election of Chairman 
Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president. This victory is the 
result of a long and hard struggle by the South African people 
against apartheid. It is also the victory of the world's unity 
and support for the South African people, especially for the ANC 
in its fight. Vietnam wants to develop relations with the new 
South Africa. In order to express the Vietnamese people's unity 
and support for the South African people and the ANC, Vice 
President Nguyen Thi Binh will attend the upcoming presidential 
inauguration in South Africa. 
  A VNA correspondent asked: Please inform us of Vietnam's 
opinion regarding reports that Chinese ships, in coordination 
with Taiwanese ships, have conducted surveys and exploration in 
the Truong Sa Archipelago [Spratlys] area, and that other ships 
have conducted oil and gas exploration there as well as in 
Vietnam's Tu Chinh [Vanguard Bank] area. 
  Answer: There are two different issues here that are 
sometimes confused. I would like to clarify the following: 
  1. Vietnam has had enough historical and juridical documents 
to reaffirm its undisputable sovereignty over the Truong Sa 
Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities involving 
exploration, surveying, and exploitation of resources in the 
Truong Sa Archipelago without Vietnam's permission are in 
violation of Vietnamese sovereignty. 
  With respect to measures to settle the dispute there, 
Vietnam 
has made it clear that these should be on the basis of equality, 
understanding, mutual respect, respect for international law and 
the 1982 Convention on Maritime Law, and respect for the 
national sovereignty of countries that have special economic 
zones and continental shelves. All sides must refrain from 
further complicating the situation, using violence, or 
threatening to use violence. Vietnam has consistently followed 
this line. 
  2. The Tu Chinh area lies fully within Vietnam's economic 
zone and continental shelf. Vietnam determinedly reaffirms its 
sovereignty over this area in conformity with the regulations of 
current international maritime law. There is no disputed area 
here; this issue was intentionally created by somebody and 
incorrectly accepted by somebody else. 
  Even before 1975, this area was divided into lots for 
bidding 
by foreign companies to conduct surveys and exploit oil and gas, 
including the Mobil Company of the United States. After 1975, 
the Vietnam Oil and Gas Company divided it into lots, conducted 
surveys, and explored for oil and gas. This included setting up 
joint ventures with foreign countries. Nobody said anything 
about it. In fact, nobody could say anything about it because 
Vietnam acted in accordance with international law. 
  Vietnam and other regional countries are concerned about 
recent reports regarding the activities of some countries, which 
complicate the situation in the Truong Sa Archipelago as well on 
Vietnam's continental shelf. In its pronouncements, the 
Vietnamese side has resolutely demanded an end to those 
activities and has confirmed the consequences of these illegal 
activities. [trong cacs tuyeen boos cuar minhf, phias vieetj nam 
dqax kieen quyeets dqoif chaams duwts nhuwngx hoatj dqoongj dqos 
vaf khawngr dqinhj trachs nhieemj veef nhuwngx haauj quar do 
cacs hoatj dqoongj trais pheps nayf gaay ra] We hold that 
respecting international law is an absolute condition for 
preserving stability and developing cooperation.

  [Text] Berlin, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] received a North Korean message on Friday 
but its contents were deemed insufficient for the IAEA to send 
inspectors to observe the changing of fuel rods at the 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, spokesman Hans Meyer said. 
  Pyongyang sent the message in response to IAEA 
Director-General Hans Blix's letter to North Korean Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam urging the communist state to accept the 
agency's conditions for the presence of IAEA inspectors during 
the refueling process. 
  As of Friday, the IAEA had no information on whether North 
Korea had already changed nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt 
reactor, Meyer said. 
  Meyer confirmed that the North Korean message from Foreign 
Minister Kim addressed to Blix came by telex Friday. 
  Based on the message's contents, however, the IAEA could not 
send inspectors to North Korea, Meyer said. 
  "The North Korean response to conditions (set by the IAEA) 
was unsatisfactory," he said. "And it did not provide grounds 
for the IAEA to send inspectors to North Korea." 
  The IAEA will study the Kim Yong-nam message in detail and 
take follow-up steps, he said. 
  Meyer added, however, that he did not know whether Blix 
would 
send another letter to North Korea. 
  Asked to confirm a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement 
that the country planned to go ahead and change the fuel rods 
and whether the work was already underway, Meyer said he had no 
information on these matters. 
  In his letter to Kim Yong-nam last Tuesday, Blix warned that 
if North Korea changed the fuel rods without an IAEA presence, 
it would constitute a grave violation of the nuclear safeguards 
agreement. 
  IAEA sources noted some progress in IAEA-North Korean 
negotiations, saying Pyongyang told the agency it was willing to 
allow additional inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory 
and maintenance work on equipment the IAEA installed last March. 
  But such headway means nothing if the problem of inspecting 
the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor remains unresolved, they 
said. 
  Although IAEA observation of the refueling at the 5-megawatt 
reactor was not specifically mentioned in the statement issued 
by the U.N. Security Council president, the work constitutes "a 
core item" in the nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  Therefore, if the IAEA cannot witness the changing of the 
reactor's fuel rods, it will not be able to check the true 
nature of North Korea's nuclear program, diplomatic sources said. 
  The agency reportedly feels it has reached a dead-end in its 
negotiations with North Korea and that the United States must 
find a breakthrough in dialogue with Pyongyang, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 KYODO -- Japan's ambassador to South 
Korea met with Korea's foreign minister Saturday [7 May] to try 
to defuse some of the outrage over remarks by Japanese Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano about Japan's role during World War II. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in a meeting with Japanese 
Ambassador to South Korea Toshio Goto, conveyed to the Japanese 
Government the concerns and regrets that Seoul has over Nagano's 
remarks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. Goto told 
Han that the official position of the Japanese Government will 
be taken after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata returns home Saturday 
evening from an overseas trip. The ambassador also said that he 
received an instruction from the Japanese Government to convey 
to Seoul that Japan takes the official stance that South Korea 
and Japan must build future-oriented relations while looking 
squarely at the past. 
  Han, in responding to the ambassador's remarks, said that 
Japan should take proper action to prevent any recurrence of the 
matter and heal the wounds of the past, adding, "South Koreans 
got hurt seriously and expressed indignation over the remarks." 
On Friday, Han summoned the ambassador to the Foreign Ministry 
and expressed "shock" and deep regrets over Nagano's remarks, 
demanding that Japan clarify the remarks and present a clear 
position. 
  In Tokyo, the Japanese justice minister offered Saturday to 
resign after setting off a flurry of international condemnation 
with his remarks that Japan was not an aggressor during World 
War II and the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication. 
  Following the invasion of the then Chinese capital of 
Nanjing 
in December 1937, Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians, according to Chinese estimates. 
Japanese historians, however, tend to cite lower estimates. 
According to estimates given at the war crimes tribunal in 
Tokyo, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more 
than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the 
vicinity over the following six weeks. 
  Also on Friday, South Korea lodged a strong protest with 
Japan over Nagano's separate remark terming "comfort women" as 
licensed prostitutes. Yu Byung-woo, director general of the 
Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, summoned Japanese 
Embassy official Hiroshi Shigeta on Friday and expressed deep 
regrets over Nagano's remarks on the "comfort women," whom the 
Japanese military took to front line brothels during World War 
II, spokesman Chang said. 
  Nagano made the remarks in an interview with KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE on Tuesday. Historians estimate that as many as 200,000 
women, most of them from the Korean Peninsula, were taken to 
wartime brothels to provide sex as "comfort women," as they were 
euphemistically called, for Japanese soldiers.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
contacted Chinese Premier Li Peng and South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on Tuesday [10 May] to apologize for former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks denying Japan's aggression 
during World War II, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hata said 
in a written message to Li and a telephone call to Kim that 
Nagano's remarks caused pain and anger to the peoples of Japan's 
Asian neighbors. 
  Separately, the government instructed Japanese Embassies in 
member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) to explain that Tokyo's policy is to face the past and 
build future-oriented ties, the officials said. ASEAN links 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and 
Thailand. 
  In his messages, Hata referred to his policy speech 
delivered 
earlier in the day in which he renewed Japan's recognition that 
its "past actions, including aggression and colonial rule, had 
caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people." 
  Hata told Li and Kim that Japan would "do its utmost toward 
the creation of peace and for the construction of a bright 
future in the Asia-Pacific region." 
  Nagano, 71, resigned Saturday, taking responsibility for his 
remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. He 
was succeeded by Hiroshi Nakai. 
  Kim told Hata in the 15-minute call that Nagano's remark was 
"unfortunate" when the two countries are trying to build a 
"future-oriented" relations and that it shocked and gave sorrow 
to the South Korean people, the officials said. 
  Kim also said Japanese leaders should not distort history 
and 
repeat actions that would hurt the feelings of the South Korean 
people. Hata said it was important to have a correct perception 
of history. 
  Hata said Nagano's remarks also were regrettable in view of 
the fact that next year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of 
World War II. 
  Hata was quoted as saying it is a time to reflect on the 
past 
and build a brighter future in cooperation with Asian nations. 
  Japanese Ambassador to China Michihiko Kunihiro handed 
Hata's 
message to Li to Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in Beijing, 
the officials said. 
  Tang told Kunihiro that China appreciates Hata's policy 
speech and his commitment to promote long-term, stable relations 
between the two countries, they said. 
  Tang was quoted as saying it would help Japan boost its 
international image and contribute to peace and stability in 
Asia and the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Cambodian Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen expressed opposition Tuesday [10 May] to 
holding certain meetings outside Cambodia and holding a general 
election to end the conflict between the government and the 
Khmer Rouge, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hun Sen told 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata that he is opposed to the 
idea of holding a meeting in Jakarta or Paris to discuss 
problems involving the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who refuse to 
accept Phnom Penh's authority, the officials said. 
  He was quoted as saying such a meeting may give the Khmer 
Rouge a chance to break the 1991 Paris Peace Accord. He also 
said the problem should be solved by the Cambodian people 
themselves. 
  The officials said, however, that it is not clear whether 
Hun 
Sen was referring to a roundtable meeting or other international 
conferences. 
  Hun Sen, in Japan since Monday to attend a meeting of the 
Socialist International, also said another general election 
proposed by Cambodian King Sihanouk cannot be held due to 
Constitutional limits stipulating a five-year term for 
parliamentarians. 
  Sihanouk suggested last week a new election be held with the 
participation of the Khmer Rouge to end the fighting. 
  The Khmer Rouge boycotted the U.N.-sponsored general 
election 
last May despite its signing of the Paris Peace Accord in 1991. 
  Hun Sen told Hata he is well aware that King Sihanouk is 
offering various ideas to achieve peace in Cambodia. 
  The Cambodian co-premier also called for a Japanese role in 
improving Cambodia's relations with Thailand, which have soured 
in recent weeks regarding the Western town of Pailin, a 
stronghold of the Khmer Rouge about a dozen kilometers east of 
the frontier with Thailand. 
  Cambodian Government troops occupied the guerrilla 
headquarters at Pailin in March but the Khmer Rouge recaptured 
it in April. 
  Cambodia has strongly protested to Thailand about forcibly 
repatriating 25,000 Cambodian refugees into Khmer Rouge-held 
areas without informing Phnom Penh. 
  Hun Sen told Hata although relations with the Thai 
Government 
are good, there are some elements in the Thai military and some 
entrepreneurs who have not stopped business with the Khmer 
Rouge, the officials said. 
  Hata told Hun Sen he has been telling Thai leaders that 
friendly ties with Cambodia are important and has been urging 
them not to obstruct efforts to achieve peace in Cambodia, they 
said. 
  Turning to bilateral affairs, Hun Sen called on Japanese 
companies to invest in his country, saying Cambodia's economic 
development achieved by receiving aid will in turn solve the 
problems of the Khmer Rouge. 
  Hata was quoted as saying he will call on Japanese companies 
to invest there but that he hopes Cambodia will make efforts to 
bring about peace. 
  Japan intends to cooperate as much as possible to that end, 
Hata was quoted as saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The following is the full 
text of policy speech delievered by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
at the Diet on Tuesday [10 May]: 
  I have been appointed as the prime minister of Japan. At 
this juncture in time, when we face difficult issues, both at 
home and abroad, I intend to brace myself to pour every effort 
into this endeavor. 
  Before making my policy remarks, I would like to express my 
sincere condolences to the victims and bereaved families of the 
tragic China Airlines accident of 26 April, and to the injured, 
who remain hospitalized, I would like to express my heartfelt 
wishes for their full and speedy recovery. The government will 
make thorough efforts to promptly discover the cause of the 
accident, and will take every possible measure to ensure that 
such a tragic incident is not repeated. 
  The Hosokawa coalition government, borne on the shoulders of 
the great support of the people and carrying a standard of 
reform, proceeded forward in earnest, but unfortunately resigned 
before the task could be completed. The duty I have been 
assigned is, firstly, to take up the standard of reform, to 
position it firmly once again, and to continue to bear it high. 
  I come from the Shinshu region, whose great literary son, 
Toson Shimazaki, once issued in his hometown of Magome the 
profound words, "lively hometowns, warmhearted hometowns, 
your-own-language hometowns." I long ago paraphrased these 
words into a slogan which reads, "lively politics, warmhearted 
politics, plain-language politics." In proceeding with reform, 
I intend to give importance to frankly discussing matters in 
plain language, enhancing understanding and walking together. 
  I intend to add respect for the spirit of coordination to 
the 
standard of reform, and thus bear the standard of politics of 
reform and coordination. Recently, we have experienced an 
unfortunate process among the parties of the coalition 
government, resulting in some groups leaving the cabinet. 
However, I personally intend to listen even more attentively to 
the opinions of both the ruling and opposition parties, and 
there is not even the slightest uncertainty in my decision and 
my oath to proceed with politics on the basis of as wide an 
agreement as possible. Fully aware of the gravity of the 
premiership and the pride of our nation, I intend to stand at 
the forefront, unwaveringly facing the difficult matters ahead, 
as I take up future-oriented issues and share both the pain and 
the joy of the people living in today's Japan. 
<H5>  Firmer Political Base To Escape From Confusion and Advance </H5>
Reforms 
  The birth of a coalition government last summer, after 38 
years of political monopoly by Liberal Democratic Party 
administrations, has brought a breath of fresh air to the 
political methods of Japan. I believe that it is of great 
historical significance in that it has given birth to new 
interest in and expectations for politics among the people, and 
in that it has generated great momentum for a review of the 
causes of stagnant administrative and socioeconomic practices. 
  Driven by the winds of a new era, the coalition government 
has devoted its utmost efforts to three reforms -- political 
reform, economic reform and administrative reform. These 
efforts by the coalition government have earned it support from 
a great many people, and it has succeeded in setting out clear 
directions for the various areas of reform, including passage of 
the laws related to political reform. Though attained over a 
period of just eight months, I trust that these and other 
achievements will be well received. While the new cabinet is 
setting out with a new line-up, we will not forget the 
aspirations at the outset of the coalition government last 
summer, and, building on the experiences so far, will manage the 
affairs of state with a renewed determination. 
  The current state of affairs -- in which Diet consideration 
of the fiscal 1994 budget is stalled, there are difficulties in 
resuming the Japan-U.S. framework talks and the situation on the 
Korean peninsula is uncertain -- is not normal, and I am keenly 
aware of my responsibility as a politician to respond to these 
issues. At no other time has the need been so great for 
political leadership to move towards resolution of these issues 
in order to sweep away the concerns of the people and their 
distrust of politics. I will make my most sincere efforts to 
fulfill the heavy requirements of the person charged with 
ultimate responsibility for the government of Japan. 
  The first task required of the new cabinet is to lead Japan 
out of such difficulty and to place it, as quickly as possible, 
on the path to a more certain future. To achieve this, the 
cabinet is prepared to act in unison in searching for solutions 
to pending issues, and I would also like to request particular 
cooperation from the Diet so that fruitful political discussion 
may take place. 
  A political regime in which policy debate plays a central 
role is essential to ensure that Japan does not take the wrong 
path as it confronts the many issues that will determine its 
future. We cannot allow the steady flame of political reform to 
be extinguished, and I am determined to continue to pursue it as 
an issue of the highest priority. To regain the people's trust 
in politics, concrete action must be taken with the intent of 
severing the roots of political corruption. In the pursuit of 
reform, a number of key issues must still be tackled, and as a 
first step, the new cabinet, respecting the advisory report of 
the council to work out electoral districts for members of the 
House of Representatives, will promptly submit the related bills 
to the Diet, and will strive to enact said bills as early as 
possible so that the next general election can be held under the 
new system. 
  Today, Japan stands at a major historical crossroads. 
Both at home and abroad, it is being pressured to determine what 
type of society it will build for the twenty-first century and 
from what position it will contribute to peace and prosperity in 
the international community. Looking down the road at what is 
to come, reforms of Japan's political, administrative and 
socioeconomic structures are part of a momentous historical 
trend and are issues that it is destined to face. Yet since 
reform inevitably involves clashes with existing interests, 
courage and enthusiasm are necessary to overcome the great pains 
and difficulties that accompany the implementation of such 
reform. At this time, it is thus most important that efforts be 
taken to gain the understanding and support of the people about 
what type of society to pursue and what path to follow in the 
journey. With a strong commitment to open policy 
decision-making and through an active exchange of opinions with 
the people, I intend to seek out the direction for Japan's 
future course. Under the national consensus thus formed, I am 
determined to promote reforms aimed at the creation of a more 
prosperous and secure society and Japan's becoming a country 
trusted by the international community. 
<H5>  Construction of a More Prosperous and Secure Society </H5>
  We remember clearly that at the peak of the bubble economy 
just a few years back, many people were under the illusion that 
everything was headed in the right direction and that this 
situation would continue indefinitely. Thereafter, however, we 
experienced the painful reality of history's iron rule that 
overconfidence is the start of failure. 
  Amidst such developments, the Japanese economy has 
experienced sufferings previously unknown, and has even gone to 
the point of shaking our confidence about future prospects. 
However, I am confident that new avenues of development will 
naturally swing open if we avoid sinking into pessimism and step 
forward with a progressive spirit towards definite goals for the 
future, learning from past errors and leaving behind past 
baggage and the burden of habit. There is no doubt that the 
Japanese economy has the energy and strength to carry this out. 
  Fortunately, we are already seeing bright signs in some 
sectors of the economy, and it is important that these 
improvements be connected to a steady process of recovery. The 
prolonged delay in enacting the fiscal 1994 budget at this 
critical juncture is alarming, and could threaten to interfere 
with the economic recovery and thereby have a serious impact on 
people's lives. The new cabinet will maintain support for the 
fiscal 1994 budget proposed by the previous cabinet, and will 
work responsibly for its implementation. To further consolidate 
the steps towards economic recovery, I would like to strongly 
appeal for full cooperation in the earliest possible passage of 
the budget for the new fiscal year and of bills and items 
already submitted to the Diet. 
  Bringing the Japanese economy onto a solid path to recovery 
and fostering the seeds of future development will also require 
that the private sector be encouraged to take on new challenges 
and make investments for the future. To accomplish this, the 
government must set an outlook for the future and take the 
initiative in making reform certain. I intend to do my utmost 
for the steady implementation of the various reforms -- 
including economic reform, administrative reform, fiscal reform, 
tax reform and the promotion of decentralization -- proposed by 
the previous cabinet and still at an intermediate stage. 
  In terms of economic reform, while striving to effect a 
transition in the nature of the economy through the cultivation 
of new industries from a new perspective, including those 
industries in the information telecommunications sector as well 
as environmentally friendly industries, and through the 
promotion of further activation of small- and medium-size 
enterprises, which despite experiencing the difficulties of the 
wave of restructuring are aggressively taking a stand in 
developing new businesses, and promotion of the relaxation and 
abolition of regulations to reactivate the economy, efforts will 
be made with the cooperation of the private sector to reduce 
price differentials between domestic and overseas markets, to 
promote the reactivation of the market and to promote 
internationally harmonious economic activities. Moreover, I 
firmly believe that such efforts will definitely contribute to 
improving the lives of the people. 
  In order to respond to the advent of the aging society, 
while 
promoting stronger welfare policies encompassing employment, 
pension, health care and nursing with a view to giving greater 
weight to improving the lives of the people, we will also 
promote living environment improvements including housing, 
transport and sewerage. As regards the difficult issue of 
agriculture, which we face currently, the government will 
expeditiously establish fundamental measures to reinvigorate 
agriculture and will make every effort to revitalize 
agricultural, mountainous and fishing village areas, taking 
fully into account the effect of the Uruguay Round agreement on 
Japanese agriculture. Further, we view education and science 
and technology as investments in the future, and aim to achieve 
a society in which diverse individuality is respected and new 
forms of cultural and economic activities are brought forth. 
  In particular, the government will take a comprehensive 
approach to cultivating a society in which men and women can 
participate in concert so that women can take part in all 
sectors of society on an equal basis with men. 
  Among the tasks we must address, realizing sweeping tax 
reform is an important matter which cannot be postponed in order 
to actively develop welfare policies with the aim of achieving 
an abundant aging society, while giving consideration to 
improving the fiscal structure, which is in a truly dire state, 
and in order to ensure fiscal sources to support tax reduction, 
and we must create a balanced tax system. The Government of 
Japan, respecting the points confirmed in the platform of the 
establishment of the new coalition government, and in line with 
Diet resolutions, with the understanding and cooperation of the 
members of all the parties and groups, will draft a concrete 
plan during June and will make maximum efforts to ensure that it 
realizes tax reform by the end of the year, with the 
understanding of the people. 
  I recognize that administrative reform and decentralization 
are issues for all of the people of Japan, and I am determined 
to act with resolution as politician in order to adjust them to 
meet the needs of the times. In terms of administrative reform, 
we aim to achieve simplification and increased efficiency and 
transparency of the administration by breaking away from 
regulations and protective administration, as well as through 
the reorganization of ministries and agencies of the central 
government, the removal of defects resulting from 
over-compartmentalized administration, the streamlining of 
special public promotional corporations, the review of 
subsidiaries and the civil servants system, the reinforcement of 
the information disclosure system and the enhancement of 
administrative monitoring system. By enacting legal measures to 
advance decentralization, the government will strive to correct 
the unipolar concentration in Tokyo and to create appealing 
regional communities with unique characteristics by 
reinvigorating the special histories, cultures and local flavors 
of the different regions of Japan. 
<H5>  Establishing an Active Foreign Policy for Trust and </H5>
Cooperation 
  Next year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the 
Pacific war, and we are aware that Japan's past actions have, in 
addition to causing great sacrifice among the people, left great 
scars which remain even today in the hearts of the peoples of 
neighboring countries. The pain and anger of the peoples of 
neighboring countries caused by the recent remarks by a cabinet 
member shows this clearly, and although the remarks were 
retracted, it is truly regrettable that such a situation arose. 
I would thus like to take this opportunity to renew the 
recognition that Japan's past actions, including aggression and 
colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many 
people. Communicating this to future generations, the path 
which Japan must take, based on its deep remorse, is to do its 
utmost towards the creation of peace and towards the 
construction of a bright future for the Asia-Pacific region. As 
the political creed of the new cabinet, I would like once again 
to state my oath that I will proceed with politics bearing this 
constantly in mind. 
  From the end of the war until quite recently, Japan was 
enveloped in the firm bipolar Cold War structure which stood 
between the United States and the Soviet Union. For that 
reason, I believe that it is an undeniable fact that Japan 
tended to be an onlooker to the developments of the 
international community. However, diplomacy and external 
relations are like interpersonal relations -- they are issues 
which cannot merely be taken care of with numbers or by going 
through superficial niceties. Indeed, the essence of these 
tasks is building relations of trust, which is the key to 
success therein. 
  The Cold War structure has now collapsed and the 
international community is now making paramount efforts to build 
a new order. During the long vacation, I visited the Republic 
of Italy, the French republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, 
the Kingdom of Belgium and other places. At a time when the new 
admission to the European Union of four countries was pending, 
president of the European Commission Jacques Delors and other 
leaders talked enthusiastically about the need for a new 
framework for peace and stability, and I witnessed their sincere 
endeavor to realize this hand-in-hand despite the many 
difficulties they faced. I once again keenly felt the greatness 
of the expectations which these nations placed on Japan, and the 
importance of international coordination. During this trip, the 
opening ceremony of the channel tunnel was held, which impressed 
me not only as a momentous undertaking adorning the end of the 
twentieth century, in which the United Kingdom and the continent 
were connected, but also as an event which symbolized the 
growing linkage of the international community. Japan must make 
efforts to promote Official Development Assistance (ODA) and to 
solve such global issues as the global environment by fully 
utilizing the technology and knowhow that it has thus far 
accumulated in its pursuit of the path of peace. Japan also 
needs to move onto center stage, play an active role for world 
peace and prosperity and earn the trust of the international 
community. In order to achieve that, we must tenaciously appeal 
for understanding for Japan's principles and for the role which 
it can play. At the same time we must coordinate with the 
developments of the international community, make painful 
decisions when necessary, and at other times maintain our 
determined position with fortitude. 
  Throughout the past half century, Japan has consistently 
been 
dedicated to peace and the United Nations has always held a high 
place in Japan's foreign policy. Recent developments in the 
international situation convince me that such a stance, rooted 
in the Constitution of Japan, has proven correct and, indeed, 
has been gaining ever-growing importance. Such achievements 
Japan has thus far made render our nation the grounds to strive 
for settling regional conflicts and promoting arms control and 
disarmament. On the same grounds, Japan should actively 
participate in United Nations peace activities. Further, I 
believe that Japan should positively engage itself in 
strengthening the functions of the United Nations, in 
particular, the Security Council, and should do all it can to 
discharge its responsibilities. 
  Further, the cornerstone of Japan's foreign policy lies in 
maintaining the alliance based on the Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty; and, on that foundation, further developing the close 
cooperative relations between Japan and the United States and, 
as one member of the Asia-Pacific region, contributing to the 
stability and development of this region. Still, while certain 
serious economic issues remain unsolved between Japan and the 
United States, the situation on the Korean peninsula is unclear, 
and we are faced with issues that could threaten the future of 
our nation if we err in our diplomatic judgment. I will exert 
all our diplomatic efforts with a strong determination, in order 
to overcome this difficult period. 
  Recently, we have seen a series of seeds of trade friction 
between Japan and various foreign countries. This situation 
exists against the background of the prominence of Japan's 
current account surplus in the world. While this current 
account surplus has arisen as a result of the untiring efforts 
of the people within the rules of international free trade, for 
one nation to continue a huge surplus cannot but invite the 
criticism of its trading partners. Further, considering that 
criticism of the closed nature of Japan's markets continues 
unabated, it is important to make efforts, intending to achieve 
a phased reduction of the current account surplus, to change 
Japan's economic structure so that it is internationally 
harmonious. In this undertaking, we must change our way of 
thinking and, not because we were told to do so by other 
nations, but for our own good, we must take the initiative in 
promoting large-scale economic reforms, including further 
improvement in market access centering on deregulation and other 
means, and the establishment of domestic demand-led economic 
management. From this perspective, we will bring to fruition 
the recently announced outline of external economic reform 
measures. Through such efforts, I strive to reopen the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks and intend to make efforts to build 
even sounder Japan-United States relations. 
  As regards the entry into force of the Uruguay Round 
agreement, which is the fruit of the collective efforts of the 
international community to strengthen the free trading system, 
it is a common goal of the Uruguay Round participants to bring 
the agreement into force on 1 January 1995. It is the Japanese 
Government's responsibility to submit the agreement and related 
implementation bills to the Diet this year and to strive towards 
their expeditious approval. Furthermore, it is important that 
we develop discussion with other countries on issues in new 
areas, such as trade and environment, and trade and investment, 
to further strengthen the free trading system. 
  The current issue concerning suspicions about the 
development 
of nuclear weapons in North Korea is a challenge to the efforts 
of the international community for nonproliferation, and is 
contrary to Japan's ideal of eventually abolishing nuclear 
weapons. This is also an issue which could jeopardize the 
security of the Northeast Asian region, of which Japan is a 
part. In order to ensure that North Korea is not isolated 
internationally, the Government of Japan tenaciously pursues the 
solution of this issue through dialogue, together with the 
United States, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of 
Korea and other neighboring nations, and intends to make maximum 
efforts to realize the prevention of nuclear weapons development 
and the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. At any rate, 
in the event that the direction of policy is decided upon in the 
United Nations, Japan will naturally respect that direction. 
Further, the government will prepare for an emergency situation 
in accordance with the Constitution of Japan, and will deal with 
this issue in close coordination and cooperation with the United 
States and the Republic of Korea. Coordination will also be 
made, if necessary, with the countries concerned of Asia. 
  Foreign policy is like a living creature: while maintaining 
an unflinching stance, there are times when one must make the 
most appropriate decision for the future, flexibly in response 
to the situation at hand. For that reason, now is the time when 
political leadership is in question. In order to make our Japan 
a nation trusted and loved in the international community, I 
intend to engrave this into my heart and soul and to remain 
keenly aware of this, as I am determined to solve the future 
foreign policy issues we will face. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We currently find ourselves in the midst of a swell of large 
and turbulent change in both the international community and the 
Japanese community, where the old order has collapsed and yet 
the new order is still not in sight. 
  As such things happen, people are seized with uncertainty 
and 
a sense of crisis. However, depending on our state of mind, we 
can turn this age into one of creativity, which will open new 
possibilities towards a better world and towards a better 
society. Merely striving against the flow to no purpose would be 
fruitless, and similarly, merely letting ourselves be carried 
with the flow would result in our losing sight of the future. 
  At times such as now, we must uphold a clear vision for the 
future, muster our courage and act. I firmly believe that 
nobody would be opposed to our goals: Japan's actively 
contributing towards building a peaceful world, creating a 
society in which the people can experience the true meaning of 
abundance as we maintain our beautiful environment to ensure 
that our children will be bequeathed that legacy, creating a 
simple and wise government, fostering an active economy and 
protecting the weak. As we approach the twenty-first century, 
we are at a time when thorough discussion between the government 
and the people and in the Diet must be held in order to achieve 
this, and we must give clear shape to our vision and bring it to 
fruition. We can no longer afford to take a roundabout route. 
  Talking in plain language about politics, I intend to work 
to 
create a country, together with the people, in which anyone can 
live without concern and a country in which we can be proud to 
the world that we are Japanese. 
  In concluding, let me ask once again from my heart for the 
understanding and support of the people and of their 
representatives in the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
told his cabinet Tuesday [10 May] he will continue the economic 
policies of the Hosokawa cabinet, pursuing economic reforms 
through wide-ranging deregulation, government officials said. 
  Hata, who took over as prime minister April 28 to replace 
Morihiro Hosokawa, also told a cabinet meeting that he will seek 
to secure sustained economic growth by stimulating domestic 
demand, the officials said. 
  Hata also emphasized the need to implement the government's 
economic stimulation package adopted in February, obtain Diet 
approval of the fiscal 1994 budget, expedite compilation of 
economic deregulation plans and to do everything possible to 
implement tax reform before the end of the year, the officials 
said. 
  Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management and 
Coordination Agency, told the meeting that he intends to have a 
government task force in charge of administrative reforms work 
out specific deregulation plans in June. 
  Regarding Japan's current account surplus, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters there are signs that 
the surplus is beginning to subside. 
  Kumagai noted that the fiscal 1993 surplus, measuring goods, 
services and some unilateral transfers such as grant aid, 
decreased in yen terms for the first time in three years. He 
also said the dollar-based surplus in March dropped from a year 
earlier.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Top government and ruling 
coalition party officials will endorse a 40-day supplement to a 
stopgap budget for fiscal 1994 Tuesday afternoon, government 
officials said. The supplementary program will cover government 
finances over a 40-day period through June 29 when the current 
regular Diet session closes, the officials said. 
  The government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
had 
been forced to draft a 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 
1994, which began April 1, because political turmoil delayed 
Diet approval of the main budget program. It has become very 
unlikely that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who took over from 
Hosokawa last month, will be able to clear the main budget 
through the Diet by May 20. 
  It will be the first time since fiscal 1990 that the 
government has had to adopt a supplement to a provisional budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Leaders of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake agreed Tuesday [10 
May] to bolster parliamentary cooperation between the two 
parties, party sources said. 
  In talks at Sakigake headquarters, SDP chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura also explored 
prospects for a future alliance, the sources said. They said 
the two party leaders agreed on holding regular consultations 
between their officials in charge of Diet strategy and policy, 
as well as the holding of study meetings by parliamentarians. 
  The SDP wants to eventually form a joint parliamentary group 
with Sakigake to confront the minority government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, the sources said. 
  Sakigake, for its part, is said to be seeking a 
reconfiguration of the political community by enticing Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) rebels to join the prospective alliance. 
  But some Sakigake members remain opposed to an alliance with 
the SDP because of outstanding differences in policy on such 
issues as defense and nuclear energy. 
  Sakigake's 15 House of Representatives legislators are 
defectors from the conservative LDP, which has strongly upheld 
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. 
  On Monday, Sakigake and the three-member legislative group 
Seiun, a breakaway from the Japan New Party, launched a unified 
18-member parliamentary group in the lower house. 
  Also on Monday, SDP leader Murayama pledged to cooperate 
with 
the LDP, the largest opposition party, against what he called 
the Hata coalition government's high-handed management of state 
affairs. 
  The SDP quit the ruling coalition after the coalition's 
majority forces led by Shinseito moved to create a 130-member 
parliamentary bloc excluding the SDP. The SDP's walkout left 
Hata's coalition with a minority in the lower house. 
  Speaking at the opening of a two-day council meeting of the 
Socialist International in Tokyo, Murayama blasted "a revival of 
power politics and fascist political forces." He saw a rise in 
popular expectations of social democratic and liberal forces, 
saying the day the SDP regains power is fast approaching.

  [Text] At a 5 May press conference, our Foreign Ministry 
spokesperson answered questions from national and foreign 
correspondents. 
  AFP and ITAR-TASS correspondents asked: Please inform us of 
Vietnam's reaction to the results of the South African election; 
the election of Mr. Nelson Mandela as president of the Republic 
of South Africa. 
  Answer: Vietnam welcomes the results of the South African 
election; the victory of the ANC and the election of Chairman 
Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president. This victory is the 
result of a long and hard struggle by the South African people 
against apartheid. It is also the victory of the world's unity 
and support for the South African people, especially for the ANC 
in its fight. Vietnam wants to develop relations with the new 
South Africa. In order to express the Vietnamese people's unity 
and support for the South African people and the ANC, Vice 
President Nguyen Thi Binh will attend the upcoming presidential 
inauguration in South Africa. 
  A VNA correspondent asked: Please inform us of Vietnam's 
opinion regarding reports that Chinese ships, in coordination 
with Taiwanese ships, have conducted surveys and exploration in 
the Truong Sa Archipelago [Spratlys] area, and that other ships 
have conducted oil and gas exploration there as well as in 
Vietnam's Tu Chinh [Vanguard Bank] area. 
  Answer: There are two different issues here that are 
sometimes confused. I would like to clarify the following: 
  1. Vietnam has had enough historical and juridical documents 
to reaffirm its undisputable sovereignty over the Truong Sa 
Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities involving 
exploration, surveying, and exploitation of resources in the 
Truong Sa Archipelago without Vietnam's permission are in 
violation of Vietnamese sovereignty. 
  With respect to measures to settle the dispute there, 
Vietnam 
has made it clear that these should be on the basis of equality, 
understanding, mutual respect, respect for international law and 
the 1982 Convention on Maritime Law, and respect for the 
national sovereignty of countries that have special economic 
zones and continental shelves. All sides must refrain from 
further complicating the situation, using violence, or 
threatening to use violence. Vietnam has consistently followed 
this line. 
  2. The Tu Chinh area lies fully within Vietnam's economic 
zone and continental shelf. Vietnam determinedly reaffirms its 
sovereignty over this area in conformity with the regulations of 
current international maritime law. There is no disputed area 
here; this issue was intentionally created by somebody and 
incorrectly accepted by somebody else. 
  Even before 1975, this area was divided into lots for 
bidding 
by foreign companies to conduct surveys and exploit oil and gas, 
including the Mobil Company of the United States. After 1975, 
the Vietnam Oil and Gas Company divided it into lots, conducted 
surveys, and explored for oil and gas. This included setting up 
joint ventures with foreign countries. Nobody said anything 
about it. In fact, nobody could say anything about it because 
Vietnam acted in accordance with international law. 
  Vietnam and other regional countries are concerned about 
recent reports regarding the activities of some countries, which 
complicate the situation in the Truong Sa Archipelago as well on 
Vietnam's continental shelf. In its pronouncements, the 
Vietnamese side has resolutely demanded an end to those 
activities and has confirmed the consequences of these illegal 
activities. [trong cacs tuyeen boos cuar minhf, phias vieetj nam 
dqax kieen quyeets dqoif chaams duwts nhuwngx hoatj dqoongj dqos 
vaf khawngr dqinhj trachs nhieemj veef nhuwngx haauj quar do 
cacs hoatj dqoongj trais pheps nayf gaay ra] We hold that 
respecting international law is an absolute condition for 
preserving stability and developing cooperation.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 9 - 'One enemy is too many, a hundred 
friends are too few.' Such is the Vietnamese saying which is 
often quoted these days by mouth and in deed by the Vietnamese 
leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are 
the visits to Indonesia and Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to 
India by Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh, the 
visits to Vietnam by dignitaries from the Czech Republic and 
Ukraine, and the constant influx of foreign business people who 
visit to probe the market opportunities in Vietnam. American 
businesses even held an exhibition in Hanoi to advertize their 
industrial and consumer goods. 
  In the 50 days from March Vietnam hosted over 50 foreign 
delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of 
business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents 
of Mongolia and the Philippines, the prime ministers of 
Singapore, Thailand, Sweden and Australia, the deputy prime 
minister of Russia, and HRH Princess Anne and minister of state 
for external relations of Great Britain. During the same period, 
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi 
visited Malaysia, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials 
visited countries in Asia and America. In the coming days, 
President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy 
Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong are expected to visit various 
countries and regions in the world. 
  On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their 
guests and hosts that 'Vietnam wants to be friend all the 
countries in the world', that 'Vietnam is trying to build a 
law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an 
equitable and civilised society', and that 'Vietnam pursues an 
open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and 
multilateralise its international relations'. 
  These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have 
fought 
through four decades of war to defend and build their country. 
They are also in line with the current trend of the world. 
  In fact, Vietnam has been moving along these lines since the 
beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of 
the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements, 
including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the 
people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country, 
the world is seeing Vietnam make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8, 
which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years, 
export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850 
joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total 
prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion USD. Visiting these 
joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German, 
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages. 
  The world also sees an increased presence of American 
businesses in Vietnam. The lifting of the US embargo against 
Vietnam has finally driven home to many Americans that they have 
come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that 
American economic interests in Vietnam are already, really 
sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told this writer that 
when the remaining few consular matters are settled, Vietnam and 
the US will open representative offices at each other's capital. 
  When that comes, it will be yet more proof of Vietnam's 
successes in its renewal cause which has helped Vietnam improve 
its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and 
international institutions and organisations.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 6 -- A grand meeting was held here 
today to mark the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu battle - 
most resounding victory of the Vietnam Army over the French 
expeditionary force (May 7, 1954). 
  Prominent among those present at the event were party 
General 
Secretary Do Muoi, President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, and General Vo 
Nguyen Giap, former commander-in-chief of the VPA and commander 
of the Dien Bien Phu battle. 
  In the key-note speech at the meeting, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet said: 'The Dien Bien Phu victory entered into the history 
of the Vietnamese people as a bach dang, a chi lang, and a dong 
da battle in the 20th century, a golden marker in the 
thousand-year history of building and defending the nation, a 
real and legendary exploit in the Ho Chi Minh time. 
  That is an ever lasting pride of the Vietnamese people, a 
source of encouragement to all nations in struggle for national 
independence, freedom and the human values'. 
  The prime minister pointed out that the Dien Bien Phu 
victory was made from the braveness and growth of the whole 
nation, the correctness of the revolutionary line, the vitality 
new regime, new society and new state in face of war challenges, 
the strength of the Peoples Armed Forces and the international 
support which the Vietnamese people remember and for which they 
were grateful to forever. 
  The victory, he said, is heritage of the national tradition, 
the development of the august revolution, and the crown of the 
first war of resistance. 
  The prime minister said that the Vietnamese people were 
launching a new struggle for prosperity, happiness and social 
justice. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said he strongly believed that 
the Vietnamese people would push up the current process of 
renovation and development to steady success. 
  After reaffirming Vietnam's persistent foreign policy of 
being friends with all countries in the world, Prime Minister 
Kiet noted: 'After Dien Bien Phu especially in recent years, the 
relations between Vietnam and France has clearly entered into a 
new period. The multi-faceted cooperation between the two 
countries has proved that when the two parties have mutual 
understanding and goodwill, they could totally close their past 
pages to develop their normal fine relations. 
  The prime minister called on the entire nation to 
concentrate on building the country as well as the tasks of 
defending national independence, sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and national security. 'We should exert our efforts 
in strengthening the people's army, the people's security force 
and other people's armed forces to ensure that they would always 
play their key role together with the entire people, to firmly 
defend the airspace, the sea, and the territory, including the 
islands of our motherland', the prime minister stressed.

  [Text] The provincial party committee, People's Council, 
and People's Committee of Lai Chau Province held a solemn 
meeting in Dien Bien Phu [DBP] this morning to mark the 40th 
anniversary of the historic Dien Bien Phu victory. Present were 
Doan Khue, Political Bureau member and defense minister, 
representing the party Central Committee; Deputy Prime Minister 
Nguyen Khanh, representing the government; National Assembly 
Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu; representatives of various 
departments and branches at the central level; representatives 
of Lao Cai, Son La, Yen Bai, and Hoa Binh Provinces; 
representatives of Luang Prabang and Phong Saly Provinces in the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic; and 20,000 people from various 
ethnic groups in Lai Chau. 
  Delivering a speech at the meeting, Comrade Nguyen Niem,

development of the war of resistance against the French that 
climaxed with the Dien Bien Phu campaign. As for the role and 
significance of the decisive and historic Battle of Dien Bien

French. The Dien Bien Phu tradition has been developed to the 
fullest, it contributed to bringing about the great victory in 
the spring of 1975, and it has helped us continue to overcome

Be Laden With Fruit and Panicles of Rice, and Smiles Bloom on 
Young Faces. It was designed to commemorate the 40th 
anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory.

  [Text] On the occasion of the 176th anniversary of the 
birth of Karl Marx -- 5 May 1818 -- NHAN DAN carries an article 
by Hoang Tung entitled: A Science of Life. The newspaper says 
that Marxism- Leninism is part of the colossal treasure of 
wisdom accumulated by human society. Marxist doctrine has 
extraordinary value in the science of thinking and in the idea 
of liberating society, human beings, and thinking. Marxist 
doctrine has a long-lasting vitality. It is an open doctrine 
that has been constantly supplemented and developed, and has 
determined their path of national liberation, regained their 
independence and freedom, and taken the initiative in renovating 
their socialist thinking. It has increased production toward 
the goal of building a prosperous people, powerful country, and 
civilized society. We must firmly grasp the science of thinking 
and the pattern of national development so as to bring 
Vietnamese thinking to a new level on the basis of our guiding 
ideology: Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought. 
  To study Marxism is to study his scientific method of 
thinking and struggle to follow his example in dedicating our 
whole life to our lofty cause.

<F P=106> [Statement by Le Hoang Quan, party committee secretary of </F>
Bien Hoa City in Dong Nai Province; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Summary] Bien Hoa City is the cultural and economic 
center of Dong Nai Province. It is also a major economic 
development area of the southeastern region of the country. 
With a population of over 400,000 made up by 140,000 Catholics, 
30,000 Buddhists, and a number of Cao Daists, the main concern 
of the local authorities is to raise the revolutionary vigilance 
among the people, while effectively carrying out the party and 
state policy toward religions. The authorities should strive to 
avoid the situation of the enemy exploiting the extremists 
within religions to agitate the public to commit illegal 
activities. 
  To subdue the `peaceful evolution' activities in the 
locality, the authorities have to: 
  - Strengthen educational campaigns to help cadres, members 
of 
the armed forces, and people of Bien Hoa to realize all 
maneuvers that enemy may use in the city. 
  - The enemy will carry out their scheme in many fields. We 
need to consolidate the people's patriotic traditions in 
building up more steadfast armed forces that can positively 
prevent and break down all sabotage activities. 
  - Party and state organizations should intensify internal 
security task and suppress corruption and ironhandedness. 
  - Taking advantage of our open door policy, the enemy will 
find ways to intrude and cause disorder. Hence, we need to be 
careful and flexible while expanding our external relations and 
cooperation activities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Trong </F>
Xuyen, member of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central 
Committee and deputy defense minister, by correspondent Pham 
Minh Chau; place, date not given] 
  [Summary] [Pham Minh Chau] "Dear Comrade Deputy Minister: 
As chairman of the Committee for Fighting Corruption and 
Smuggling under the Ministry of National Defense, how do you see 
the evil of corruption and smuggling in the Army?" 
  [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] Corruption and smuggling are painful 
evils imposed on our people. The party and state have 
introduced many resolutions, directives, and measures to stop 
these evil practices, but the results have been very limited. 
Our Army is a part of society. Therefore, the evils of 
corruption and smuggling have also appeared in the Army. 
Because of its tight control and different operational 
characteristics, however, corruption and smuggling are less 
severe, with very few serious cases in the Army. 
  "The most common form of corruption and smuggling in the 
Army 
is when private traders lure greedy military personnel and units 
to be a front for their illegal businesses. Some units also use 
military vehicles to transport smuggled goods or use military 
facilities to store smuggled goods. Some units allow their 
troops to smuggle goods while carrying out their economic 
duties. Yet the number of these cases and the quantity of goods 
involved is not great." 
  At present, the Ministry is investigating military units 
that 
have bought smuggled cars to sell for profit. 
  "Regarding corruption, its main manifestation is the 
exploitation of management positions and authority over 
controlling materials and budgets to accept bribes. They also 
take advantage of payment loopholes to create a difference 
between the actual cost and the amount of money recorded on 
paper or on an invoice in order to appropriate state property, 
budget money, and unit funds. This type of corruption is 
normally practiced in infrastructure construction projects 
because of the great amount of money and materials, management 
difficulties, and loopholes in payment procedures." 
  [Pham Minh Chau] "Dear Comrade Deputy Minister, can you 
brief 
us on the results of the fight against corruption and smuggling 
in the Army following the issuance of directives by the party 
Central Committee Secretariat and the prime minister?" 
  [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] It is possible to say that our Ministry 
has strictly observed the party Political Bureau directive, the 
National Assembly resolution, and the government directives on 
fighting corruption and smuggling. The Military Inspection 
Section has worked with military leaders to conduct financial, 
logistical, material management, and transport management 
inspections in units suspected of corruption. It also 
coordinates with market management teams to clarify some cases. 
By checking 613 military vehicles in the 5th, 7th, and 9th 
Military Regions and in two armed corps, we discovered 20 
vehicles transporting illegal goods. We also discovered more 
than 30 civilian vehicles using military registration plates to 
carry smuggled goods. In the fourth quarter of 1993 and the 
first quarter of 1994, military inspection and control organs 
discovered and filed charges in many corruption cases. In the 
first quarter of 1994, we imposed penalties on 14 cadres and 
party members for corruption and 27 other military personnel for 
smuggling. The results achieved in the fight against corruption 
and smuggling have brought about positive changes, but compared 
to the requirement they are still far from our expectations. 
  [Pham Minh Chau] "Based on those cases of corruption and 
smuggling you have uncovered, can you cite the main causes of 
these evils in the Army?" 
  [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] There are many causes; they have been 
mentioned in several state and section meetings, conferences, 
and seminars. We have talked enough about the causes of 
corruption and smuggling. The causes of these evils in the Army 
are the same as elsewhere. In the Army, the most direct and 
important cause is the lack of responsibility and proper 
management by leaders and unit commanders over their 
subordinates. We must differentiate two separate sets of 
circumstances, though. The first is intentionally creating 
conditions and providing the necessary papers for personal 
benefit. The second, which is more common, is a lack of 
vigilance and knowledge of the law and state and army 
regulations by Army leaders. Their subordinates take advantage 
of this to practice corruption and smuggling. In any event, the 
leaders still have to be responsible for wrongdoings in their 
units. 
  [Pham Minh Chau] "So in the future, what measures should be 
taken to prevent and fight corruption and smuggling 
sufficiently?" 
  [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] Corruption poses a danger to our 
renovation undertaking. Fighting corruption and smuggling is an 
important undertaking of the entire party, people, and Army and 
all of society. The Central Military Party Committee and the 
Ministry are resolutely fighting these evils in the Army because 
this is one of the urgent requirements to build a revolutionary 
army. 
  Regarding practical measures to prevent and fight corruption 
and smuggling, each unit needs to establish its most appropriate 
and effective way of fighting. Whatever measures are taken, 
though, they must concentrate on three fundamental measures: 
combining education and management with inspection, maintaining 
tight control, and strictly punishing violations according to 
state laws and military discipline. 
  Fighting corruption and smuggling is a very complicated task 
because humans have hidden diseases. We believe that with unity 
between management and command and between the higher and lower 
levels, together with public participation, the fight will 
achieve actual results on the way toward eliminating these evils 
step by step to restore military discipline and order, thus 
earning the trust and love of the party, state, and people. 
  [Pham Minh Chau] Thank you, Comrade Deputy Minister.

<F P=106> [Report by Vu Trung Hung, correspondent of the Binh Dinh </F>
Province Radio and Television Station] 
  [Text] Lately, particularly since early 1994, Binh Dinh 
province has intensified its efforts to deal with various cases 
of smuggling. The market control force, in coordination with 
the public security force and the authorities at various levels, 
has made arrests involving large quantities of electronics goods 
illicitly imported through the port of Qui Nhon. It has also 
confiscated some 400,000 packs of foreign-brand cigarettes 
smuggled through the Central Highlands to Qui Nhon, from where 
they would have been transported to various northern and 
southern provinces. 
  It is especially noted that the province has dealt with some 
cases of car imports which were not carried out in accordance 
with the state regulations. 
  After sending a report to the government, on 21 March 1994 
the province people's committee decided to confiscate eight cars 
with steering wheels on the opposite [right-hand] side which had 
been illicitly imported and put into use by the Binh Dinh 
Province Marine Import-Export Corporation. 
  On 3 May 1994 the provincial people's committee decided to 
confiscate 38 sedan cars illicitly imported and kept at a 
storage facility rented from the Dieu Tri branch of the 2d 
Central Agricultural Supply Corporation in Danang. These cars 
were later claimed by a number of people who said they were 
representatives of the Khanh Hoa Province General Trading 
Corporation, the Kon Tum Province General Trading Corporation, 
the Nhatrang Sea Liners Supply Service Corporation, and the Thai 
Binh Duong [Pacific] corporation under the Ministry of the 
Interior. But these people were unable to produce any papers -- 
affidavits or powers of attorney -- of the agencies they claimed 
to be representing. Although some of them did produce some 
papers, there were many irregular and contradicting points found 
in them. For instance, an import permit issued by the Nhatrang 
licensing department was found to be at variance with the 
regulations of the Ministry of Trade. All the owners of these 
goods were found to have no authority or no licenses in the car 
import-export business. There were also wrongdoings on the part 
of the Binh Dinh Customs Office. For instance, the office did 
not put the cars under temporary custody pending customs 
measures. It kept them in storage without informing the local 
administration of this. Customs control measures were taken 
before some cars involved had arrived. Cars already checked by 
customs were kept indiscriminately among unchecked cars. 
Although imported through the port of Danang, some of the cars 
were found when they arrived in Qui Nhon to have not gone 
through control procedures as stipulated. 
  The Binh Dinh Province People's Committee has decided to 
confiscate the 38 [as heard] cars cited above. The Provincial 
Market Control Steering Committee has forwarded the files of 
these cases to responsible investigation agencies to clarify 
violations involving a number of customs cadres, some individual 
owners of goods, and some agencies. 
  Binh Dinh province is also taking legal action against the 
province's Marine Import-Export and Shipping Company on charges 
of illicitly importing 73 car chassis, 60 automotive engines, 
and 35 sets of truck chassis with engines, which were originally 
trucks with steering wheels on the right-hand side.

  [Text] On 7 May, at the Vietnam Scientific-Technological 
Associations Union Office in Hanoi, Comrade Nong Duc Manh, 
member of the party Central Committee Political Bureau and 
chairman of the National Assembly held a working session with 
representatives and members of various scientific-technological 
associations. 
  After hearing scientists, representing more than 300,000 
members of the union, report on the activities and achievements 
of the union during the past period as well as its measures 
aimed at creating favorable conditions for 
scientific-technological associations to carry out their tasks 
effectively, Comrade Nong Duc Manh commended the union members 
for their efforts and high sense of responsibility. He highly 
appraised the role and position of the intelligentsia 
representing various scientific-technological associations in 
Vietnam. He said that these people have engaged in research and 
diversified tasks which have positively contributed to the 
renovation process. He expressed the hope that various 
scientific-technological associations would draw on experiences 
and conduct more creative research to improve scientific 
projects and apply scientific-technological innovations to the 
socioeconomic development program, thereby contributing to 
building the law-governed state of the people, by the people, 
and for the people. 
  He also called on these associations to positively 
participate in the struggle against hunger and poverty, thus 
contributing to implementing the objectives of making our people 
prosperous, our country powerful, and our society just and 
civilized.

  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, Dong Nai Province 
has spent nearly 12 billion dong on three 15-kilovolt 
electricity projects to provide electricity service to isolated 
villages. The first project, at a cost of 4 billion dong, 
consists of a 15-kilovolt medium voltage line more than 15 km 
long, connecting Tan Phu District to the boundary of Lam Dong 
Province and a 0.4 kilovolt electricity line. The other two 
projects include a power line to Xuan Binh village, a heroic 
village in Nam Khanh District, with a total cost of more than 5 
billion dong, and a low voltage line, at a cost of more than 2 
billion dong, to Bao Han Mot village, a former revolution base 
in Thong Nhat District. 
  With local funding and public contributions, Dong Nai is 
trying to provide electricity to all villages in the province by 
1995.

  [Editorial: "Chat Thai Moves in Right Direction"] 
  The Chat Thai Party's decision Saturday to conduct an 
inquiry 
into the drug trafficking allegations made against one of its 
MPs, Thanong Siriprichaphong, by the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) represents a step in the right direction to 
clear up this scandal. The move will dispel any doubt that the 
party will simply blindly jump to the defence of its member and 
let the case be swept under the rug after the embattled MP has 
made the denials. 
  Notably, the internal investigation on the drug dealing 
charges was the first taken by the party executive committee 
under a new helmsman, Mr Banhan Sinlapa-acha, who assumed the 
party leadership Saturday. Mr Banhan also called upon people to 
come forward to see him if they have recriminating evidence 
against any other Chat Thai MPs who may have a hand in shady or 
illegal activities. Such uncharacteristic straightforwardness 
should be a healthy sign especially for the Chat Thai Party and 
also for the political atmosphere in general. 
  Mr. Thanong's denial of all the charges made against him by 
the DEA and his announcement that he is ready to fly to the US 
to defend the case are not unexpected. Yet, these 
pronouncements by themselves cannot dispel all doubts that may 
still linger in the minds of many people who are well aware of 
the MP's background or who heard what he said during the 
much-publicised press conference at the Parliament last Friday. 
He could repeat the same denials 100 more times anywhere in 
this country, but it will simply be a self-deception if he 
expects more people to take him seriously. The lingering 
scepticism is not likely to vanish unless he shows his courage 
to prove his innocence by deed rather than words -- that is to 
face his accuser in the US district court. 
  It is not impossible that the whole saga may be a 
well-calculated ploy to discredit the Chat Thai Party and to 
divert public attention from all the problems and negative 
events confronted by the Government as suggested by some 
Opposition MPs. But this is a totally different issue from that 
of Thanong's. A clear answer must be put forward by the Chat 
Thai Party before the case could be put to rest. 
  The party's five-man committee to probe the drugs scandal 
has 
been assigned with a daunting task to find out the facts and to 
make public the result of the findings. At stake is not the 
reputation of Thanong, but, more importantly, that of the party 
which has been tarnished more or less. Therefore, the probe 
team must be impartial and, at the same time, broadminded. To 
get the facts, it is necessary that the committee must seek 
information and evidence from the accuser which is the DEA, the 
Office of Narcotics Control Board, the Police Department or even 
the National Security Council. In the meantime, the embattled 
Nakhon Phanom MP who should be regarded as innocent until proven 
otherwise, must be given the opportunity to prepare his defence. 
  Mr Thanong's predicament is, after all, just the tip of the 
iceberg of the shady or illegal business activities that several 
of our politicians, senior police and military officers and 
senior civil servants are believed to be involved in and which 
are yet to be exposed -- if they ever get to be exposed at all. 
There have been talks or reports of some parliamentarians 
acting as mafia bosses, operating illegal casinos and 
surrounding themselves with bodyguards or gunmen, or MPs who 
talk persuasively about forest conservation in the Parliament 
but who own and operate sawmills which clandestinely accept 
illegal logs. Ironically, these men can manage to stand tall in 
society and accorded due respect. 
  Chat Thai is a big party which is made up of members of 
diverse backgrounds and business activities -- some of whom are 
known to be involved in unlawful or unethical activities. The 
party should also be well aware of its problem of reputation and 
recognition, especially among the well-educated public. If the 
party is to gain the trust and recognition of the public, its 
first priority should be to clean up its image which, in the 
past, has been tainted by its close association with or its 
subservient attitude toward politically ambitious military 
officers and the lack of political conscience. 
  With a new leader in charge, the Thanong case will hopefully 
provide a fresh start for the Chat Thai Party to project a new 
image and to take a new political course that will be more 
acceptable to the general public.

  [Excerpt] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin stressed 
that it is not yet necessary to use monetary measures to curb 
inflation because the Bank of Thailand is still able to ensure 
the inflation rate does not exceed 4.5 per cent this year. 
  In an interview with THE NATION, Tharin responded to an 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggestion urging the Thai 
government to cautiously deal with possible high inflation. 
Tharin said that the Bank of Thailand is still able to "fine 
tune" the economy. Moreover, the Finance Ministry has 
maintained discipline in government's spending, he said. 
  He said that he got an assurance from the Bank of Thailand 
that the inflation rate would not exceed 4.5 per cent by the end 
of this year. Although the inflation rate in the first quarter 
was 4.8 per cent, Tharin said that the rate increased by only 
3.7 per cent over the past 12 months. In the first quarter of 
1993, the inflation rate rose by 3.3 percent over the previous 
year. 
  Tharin attributed the 5 percent inflation rate in January to 
the rise in farm prices. The central bank has already informed 
him that farm prices will be soon reduced, he noted. 
  "The IMF suggestion came as result of the brief observation 
from two or three IMF staffers who visited Thailand only for a 
few days. At any rate, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of 
Thailand have been particularly aware of the inflation rate," he 
said. 
  Tharin said that the inflation was largely caused by 
inadequate good supply, not the government's excessive 
expenditure. "I still believe Thailand will be able to control 
the inflation rate at 4.5 per cent, while the real economic 
growth rate should be 8 per cent on an annual basis," he said. 
Tharin added that he expects the private sector will 
participate more in the investment sector in the near future. 
  "My prime concern, instead, is slower growth in domestic 
savings," Tharin said. He said that he has assigned the Bank of 
Thailand to find out the cause of the marginal growth in 
domestic savings; whether money was transferred to other types 
of investment such as mutual funds and has not been brought back 
into the system. 
  Tharin stressed that the Finance Ministry will keep the 
government's expenditure below Bt[baht]715 billion in 1995. 
Although the government has to spend Bt32 billion on a salary 
rise for civil servants, Tharin said the pay rise is unlikely to 
cause inflation problems. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Statistics show that Japan remains Thailand's 
biggest trading partner with bilateral trade volume of 513,000 
million baht in 1993, an increase of 15 percent. 
  The Department of Business Economics says that in 1993, Thai 
exports to Japan accounted for 160,000 million baht, an increase 
of 10 percent. Thailand imported 535,000 [figure as heard] 
million baht from Japan. This represented an increase of 17 
percent, widening Thailand's trade deficit with Japan to 193,000 
million baht. 
  The United States came second in trade relations with 
bilateral trade volume of 338,000 million baht, an increase of 
10 percent over the figure of 1993. The European Union and ASEAN 
came next. Thailand suffered a trade deficit of 17,000 million 
baht with the European Union, while it registered a surplus of 
56,000 million baht and six million baht over the United States 
and ASEAN respectively.

  [Text] Thailand has asked Myanmar [Burma] to regulate the 
prices of its natural gas export in line with fuel oil prices. 
  During his meeting with Myanmar Minister of Energy U Khin 
Maung Thein, Minister to the Prime Minister's Office Sawit 
Phothiwihok told the Myanmar minister that Thailand plans to 
utilize natural gas supply from Myanmar at the power plant in 
Rat Buri Province in the central plain bordering Myanmar. 
  He explained that the power plant can use either fuel oil or 
natural gas and that higher prices of natural gas would not be 
acceptable. 
  The Thai minister also informed his Myanmar counterpart that 
Thailand has also contracted to buy energy from the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic and Malaysia. Moreover, the government has 
allowed the private sector to participate in power generation. 
He said Thailand could not afford to buy fuel at higher prices 
from Myanmar.

  [Text] Police Colonel Thatnarong Winyanrat, commander of 
the Border Patrol Police Unit No. 34 in Tak Province, said 
during an interview that he agreed with the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board's [NCB] report labelling Tak, Phitsanulok, and 
Chiang Mai Provinces as the major marijuana-producing areas in 
northern Thailand. He pointed out that over 75 percent of the 
area in Tak is mountains and dense jungles suitable for 
marijuana cultivation by hill tribes such as at Pang Sangkasi, 
Vang Tamlung, and Phaphun villages in Na Bot District and Na 
Khiri village in Muang Tak District. 
  Police Colonel Thatnarong added that capitalists from the 
northeastern region and upper part of the northern region will 
normally give marijuana seeds to tribesmen to begin cultivation 
at the beginning of the rainy season and provide the necessary 
instructions to ensure a bumper harvest. Marijuana is 
compressed into bars and sent by trucks to Chiang Rai Province 
from where the drug will be shipped down the Mekong River to the 
Gulf of Thailand for export to foreign countries and sale in 
domestic markets. 
  The officer said: "Our unit has been coordinating with the 
northern branch of the Office of Narcotics Control Board in 
search of marijuana plantations in the northern provinces. We 
destroyed not less than 15 tons of the grass worth millions of 
baht during each crackdown operation. However, the authorities 
also faced numerous difficulties because all the plantations are 
located in remote and mountainous areas which enables the 
culprits to flee before their arrival." 
  Meanwhile, Suphong Manatphaibun, deputy governor of Nakhon 
Phanom Province, disclosed that the provincial administration 
does not have sufficient information to confirm the NCB office's 
claim that Nakhon Phanom is the largest marijuana-producing area 
in the country. However, he admitted that there are some 
marijuana plantations in the province. Several portions of the 
drug found in the province were smuggled into the country and 
authorities have been instructed to launch regular search and 
suppression operations. 
  Sub-lieutenant Prawat Athipanya, deputy governor of Sakon 
Nakhon Province, expressed his disagreement with the report by 
the NCB Office saying Sakon Nakhon is one of the three largest 
marijuana- producing provinces in Thailand, noting that small 
plantations are scattered in the mountainous areas of Kut Bak 
District and Phuphan reserve forest. Unlike other provinces, 
Sakon Nakhon does not have any big investors engaging in 
marijuana cultivation. The provincial administration has 
ordered that continuous suppression operations be carried out 
throughout the province. 
  Sub-lieutenant Praswant said: "Most of the grass is grown in 
Tha Uthen District of Nakhon Phanom Province and in Laos, where 
Lao farmers plant marijuana along the bank of the Mekong River. 
We can clearly see the plants from the Thai side." He 
disclosed that Sakon Nakhon is no longer a marijuana transit 
point due to intensified suppression operations by provincial 
officials. 
  Banphot Piamdi, director of the Narcotics Control Center in 
the northern region, revealed that opium cultivation remains the 
big problem in the 17 northern provinces. The total acreage 
used for opium cultivation in 1993 was as high as 16,000 rai 
[2.5 rai is equivalent to one 1 acre]. Marijuana cultivation 
was first introduced to Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Mae Hong Son, 
Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai Provinces in 1987 and later spread to 
other nearby provinces. Tribesmen have found it easier and less 
complicated to grow marijuana than opium. Moreover, they can 
earn more from planting marijuana. More tribes people have now 
shifted to planting marijuana, but most of them plant the crop 
for their own consumption and sale in small quantities. 
Marijuana is not as big a business here as it is in the 
northeast. 
  Witthaya Kaeopharadai, Phalang Tham MP from Nakhon Si 
Thammarat Province, said people should not think that the U.S. 
drug charge against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong is politically 
motivated, adding that Thanong has acted correctly in appointing 
lawyers to deal with and clear himself from the U.S. accusation. 
  Asked about the thesis by an NCB official on police 
involvement in drug trafficking connections, Police General 
Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department, 
replied that the topic is not unusual. In the past, several 
police officers and officials of other government agencies have 
been arrested on drug charges.

  [Text] The Government is considering drafting an 
anti-money laundering law as part of stepped-up measures against 
the lucrative drug trade. 
  The disclosure, made by an anti-narcotics agency chief 
yesterday, follows the United States accusation last week that 
prominent Thai businessman and Opposition Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichapong is involved in exporting marijuana to the US. 
  Pol Gen [Police General] Chawalit Yotmani, secretary-general 
of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], said his 
agency was in the process of coordinating with government 
organizations to draw up the law. 
  The legislation would empower government officials to check 
into the financial records of individuals suspected of 
involvement in the narcotics trade and to confiscate any money 
found to have been derived from drug sales. 
  The ONCB earlier successfully pushed for the law empowering 
the Government to confiscate the assets of people convicted of 
narcotics offenses. 
  "The planned legislation is expected to help effectively 
deal 
with the lucrative narcotics business," said Pol Gen Chawalit. 
  The ONCB chief said he believed government agencies 
responsible for financial matters such as the Finance Ministry 
had the capability and methods to trace the financial records of 
suspected drug traders. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit, emphasizing the urgency of the 
legislation, 
said he had discussed the matter with government leaders and 
many had supported its early implementation. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan, while confirming 
the proposed law was in the making, said the Government would 
have to be careful in enacting such legislation as it could 
contradict the principle of basic human rights. 
  The Government will have to study past problems in solving 
the narcotics problem before deciding what measures should be 
incorporated to enhance efficiency. 
  Finance Deputy Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri said he fully 
supported Pol Gen Chawalit's proposal as the measure would 
enable officials to fight the narcotics trade more effectively. 
  "We must help eradicate dirty money from the drug business," 
said the outspoken politician. 
  He said the proposed legislation, if implemented carefully, 
would not violate individuals' rights. 
  The checking of financial records could be limited to people 
on official blacklists only or to those suspected of involvement 
in the narcotics trade about whom the ONCB lacks evidence to 
press charges. 
  The Finance Ministry is ready to support the ONCB's 
proposal, 
he said. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit, when asked to comment on Mr Thanong's case 
yesterday, refused to offer any statement. 
  He said on Mr Thanong's claim that he had not been contacted 
by the US Drug Enforcement Agency concerning the accusation that 
the MP could say anything he wanted. 
  "I personally have no comment on that," he said. 
  There have been reports more politicians have been 
blacklisted for narcotics involvement, but Pol Gen Chawalit said 
only: 
  "I cannot make any comment even if I know anything about it. 
We just don't have enough evidence." 
  Mr Thanong is due to appear before the House Parliamentary 
Affairs Committee to answer the US allegations. 
  Committee member Pricha Suwannathat said the panel would ask 
the US Embassy in Bangkok to supply all documents related to the 
allegation. 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday dismissed as groundless 
an unpublished paper alleging that there were eight other MPs 
from the Northeast involved in drug trafficking. 
  "I can not give this thesis any credence," said Mr Marut. 
  The media has publicized a so-called "secret" Chulalongkon 
University paper by Chumphon Phongsuwan which states there are 
eight other MPs involved in the drug trade. The paper, entitled 
"Marijuana Politics: a Power Structure Case Study of Local 
Politics" earned the special agent with the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board the best thesis award of 1987. 
  "There are both good and bad people in every organization 
including the House. But no rumor should sling groundless mud 
to dirty the House," said Mr Marut. 
  He said the paper did not specify when the MPs allegedly 
involved in the drug trade sat in Parliament and the lack of 
detail led him to disbelieve the allegation. 
  He also praised the Chat Thai Party for setting up a 
five-man 
committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Thanong. 
  "I believe the Chat Thai probe committee will be thorough in 
their investigation. The members are all competent statesmen 
and lawyers." 
  Chat Phatthana Party secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan 
said about the paper: 
  "We have to be openminded. The thesis did not mention any 
name in particular. The official has to investigate and show 
proof so that our country can clear this drug trafficking image." 
  Mr Prachuap said he did not believe the Chat Thai Party 
would 
protect Mr Thanong. Any member which brings notoriety to the 
party should act responsibly. 
  He said the House has the burden of proving the allegation 
and must make the information public. 
  "Every MP should be aware of the importance of his own 
reputation and history, and that is why Mr Thanong's case should 
be investigated," he said.

  [Text] The Insurance Department will tighten the rules on 
life insurance companies sending their profits to parent firms 
abroad in order to encourage them to invest more money in 
Thailand, according to Department Director General Pracha 
Charutrakunchai. 
  A maximum of 60 percent of life companies' net profits can 
now be sent abroad, with some leeway permitted by the registrar 
of insurance companies, who is the department's director-general. 
  Rapid economic growth helped enlarge the insurance market 
and 
some companies should invest more of their increased earnings 
locally, he said at the weekend. 
  The department would not set a formal ceiling for the amount 
of net profit which a company could remit abroad. It would 
consider the issue case by case, he said. 
  The move is aimed at the only foreign-owned life insurer 
operating in Thailand, American International Assurance, but Mr. 
Pracha denied that the company would suffer, saying treatment 
would be fair and would not affect the Government's policy of 
promoting foreign investment. 
  Only five foreign companies had non-life insurance 
operations 
in Thailand, New Hampshire Co, Universal Co, Guardian, 
Commercial Union, and part of the AIA operation. These five 
altogether remitted around 100 million baht in profit to their 
head offices abroad. 
  American International Assurance has more than 50 percent of 
the life insurance market in Thailand. From January to 
September 1993, about 216,700 of the total of 792,580 life 
insurance policies held by AIA clients represented 11.7 billion 
baht in premiums, compared with 24.2 billion baht for the 
industry as a whole. 
  The AIA took 3.28 billion baht in first-year premiums for 
the 
first nine month of 1993 compared with 6.57 billion baht 
generated by all 12 life insurance companies in Thailand. 
  In 1992 the company sent abroad about 700 million baht 
accounting for 48.5 percent of its total net profits. 
  The company reported healthy growth in profits last year in 
line 17-18 percent for the industry overall. 
  Mr. Pracha said he appreciated the AIA's apparent investment 
of large sums in the stock market, loans and property investment. 
  Its investment was worth as much as 30 billion baht, but he 
would still seek greater local input by the company.

  [Text] The agreement between the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments on a new framework for the exchange of defense 
technology shows that interchangeability between civilian and 
military technology has become a crucial issue in the area of 
defense following the disintegration of the Cold War structure. 
  Senior leaders of the U.S. Defense Department, including 
Secretary of Defense William Perry, show keen interest in the 
proven high level of Japanese civilian technology. They have 
been approaching Japan on this for some time. For the United 
States, which now hopes to promote interchangeability between 
civilian and military technology to strengthen its defense 
industry, while simultaneously reducing the defense budget, the 
introduction of Japanese civilian technology is necessary. 
  For Japan, maintenance of the Japan-U.S. security setup is 
an 
"irrevocable theme" (according to a senior Defense Agency 
official). As bilateral relations are constantly plagued by 
trade frictions, Japan's agreement to this new framework on 
defense technology, which was demanded by the United States, 
represented an "opportune occasion" for upholding close 
cooperation in security and defense. Thus, both countries' 
interests coincided. 
  However, the present agreement will mostly result in a 
technological transfer from Japan to the United States. There 
are concerns that "This may result in the United States alone 
walking away with the benefits." 
  The utilization of civilian technology and exchanges with 
the 
United States are also top priority issues for Japanese 
defense-related industries. These industries mainly look at the 
agreement as a framework for "joint development with both sides 
contributing the technology they possess." There are lingering 
concerns about a one-sided flow of technology to the United 
States.

  [Text] Major automobile parts maker Zexel will increase 
annual imports of foreign-made parts to 16 billion yen by 1996, 
which is over 10 times that in 1993. This figure is equivalent 
to 10 percent of the total expenses for materials. Zexel 
decided to change its procurement policy of giving priority to 
domestically made products because quality of foreign-made 
products has improved, in addition to their low prices resulting 
from yen's appreciation. 
  Zexel, which is a primary parts maker, mainly manufactures 
parts of car air conditioners and fuel injection devices, and 
sells these products directly to Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. and Isuzu 
Motors Ltd. So far, it has partially imported compressor parts 
of air conditioners from its U.S. office. The import volume was 
only 1.3 billion yen in 1993, which was less than 1 percent of 
expenses for material procurement. 
  Zexel is now studying the quality and costs of resin 
products, castings, and forgings made by U.S. and Asian makers 
to check whether or not these products are usable. In the case 
of the resin products, they have a quality level similar to that 
of Japanese products, while their prices are 5 to 10 percent 
cheaper. Zexel is likely to start importation in the near 
future. 
  On the other hand, Zexel plans to reduce the number of 
secondary and tertiary parts makers with which it does business. 
Although Zexel has a cooperative organization of subcontracting 
parts makers called "Shineikai," it will conduct stricter 
screening to decide whether to continue doing business with 
those companies.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hata on the afternoon of 30 April 
called for an emergency conference of cabinet members concerned 
with economic matters in response to the continued rise of the 
yen on foreign exchange markets in New York on 29 April. The 
conferees agreed to: 1) Establish close ties with concerned 
nations and strive for stabilization of foreign exchange rates; 
2) Work for early passage of the fiscal year 1994 budget; 3) 
Expedite completion of plans for deregulation; and 4) Strive for 
implementation of tax system reform within the current year. 
  The conference was attended by the prime minister and four 
cabinet members, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai as 
substitute for Minister of Finance Fujii who was traveling 
overseas, Minister of International Trade and Industry Hata, 
Economic Planning Agency Director General Terasawa, and 
Management and Coordination Agency Director General Ishida. A 
briefing was given by the Ministry of Finance on the current 
foreign exchange rates and discussions were held on measures to 
be taken in response to the strong yen and its impact on the 
economy. 
  As a result, the conference affirmed maintenance of 
sustained 
growth centered on domestic demand and implementation of reforms 
such as deregulation as basic policies for management of the 
future economy. Among the four items agreed upon, according to 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, the conferees agreed that 
"Japan would maintain close liaison with concerned nations and 
take appropriate and timely actions," to cope with trends in the 
foreign currency markets. The conferees also confirmed plans to 
reinforce foreign exchange stabilization measures by taking 
actions such as cooperative intervention involving yen-selling 
and dollar-buying with Europe and the United States if the yen 
should rise further. 
  The conference also agreed to expedite work on deregulation 
plans that will be a principal feature of international economic 
countermeasures to be compiled by June and that the plans will 
be "substantive in nature." They also affirmed that work on tax 
reform--consisting primarily of an income tax cut and 
consumption tax increase--will include thorough consideration of 
public opinion and the understanding and cooperation of the 
respective parties and factions, completion of a draft plan in 
June, and implementation during the current year.

  [Text] The government held an emergency conference of 
cabinet members concerned with economic affairs on the afternoon 
of 30 April to discuss its response to the strong yen and 
reconfirmed its efforts to promote deregulation and strive for 
tax reform. However, policies of this nature have been 
reiterated by Prime Minister Hata in the past and the view is 
that only minimal restraining effect can be realized thereby in 
the future if yen-buying pressure increases in foreign exchange 
markets because of the nature of the intervention posture 
assumed by U.S. currency authorities. For the time being, the 
government will probably seek to stabilize the foreign exchange 
markets through market intervention, while emphasizing the early 
implementation of interim economic reform such as working for 
deregulation and negotiating with the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on the 
implementation of tax reform. 
  After the conference, Economic Planning Agency Director 
General Terasawa stressed, "We affirmed the fact that we are 
serious about deregulation, because some quarters have taken the 
passive attitude that the idea is not feasible." Reportedly, a 
conference of administrative vice ministers of the ministries 
and agencies will be held on 9 May to confirm work to be done on 
deregulation. 
  After the conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai 
stated, 
"Positive efforts will be made to negotiate with the SDPJ, 
Sakigake [Harbinger] and New Pary Mirai [Future] (which are not 
represented in the Hata cabinet) relative to tax reform. 
Needless to say, we must also seek the understanding of the LDP." 
  The cabinet officials stress a positive attitude about both 
deregulation and tax reform, but, looking behind the scenes, you 
might say that the cabinet's statements are being made with the 
knowledge it will be difficult to realize those goals. 
Implementation of deregulation was part of the International 
Economic Reform Outline prepared in March, but indications are 
that the bureaucrats have lost some enthusiasm on the matter 
partly because of the unstable political situation. 
  Difficulties are also seen in making progress on tax reform 
because the SDPJ which is negative about raising the consumption 
tax has removed itself from the coalition. 
  The markets have already reflected these developments and 
the 
yen is in the process of rising, but 30 April did not see 
deployment of any form of countermeasure capable of providing 
immediate relief. 
  The government and the Bank of Japan have already solidified 
plans to further reinforce market intervention through 
yen-selling and dollar-buying to prevent a higher yen. As far as 
monetary policy is concerned, no action will be taken in the way 
of monetary adjustment such as lowering short-term market rates. 
It appears that there is no choice but for efforts by Japan, 
Europe, and the United States to collaborate in market 
intervention in response to the sharp rise in the yen.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] 
sponsored "Research Council for Broadcast Digitization," a 
private-sector research council of the Broadcast Administration 
Bureau director and chaired by Academic Information Center 
Director Hiroshi Inose, which was conducting a study on 
next-generation broadcasting systems channeled through 
satellites, cable, and land-based stations, issued its final 
draft report on 24 April. The main feature of the report covered 
provisions for setting standards for various technical features 
concerning digital broadcasting by fiscal year 1996, thus 
specifying a timetable for the first stage of digitization. The 
aim of the timetable is to encourage domestic sources to embark 
on research and development at an early stage in view of trends 
in overseas areas. The report provides a course for 
digitization, while having the potential of rekindling debate on 
a modification of plans for analog-based high-vision 
broadcasting. 
  The Research Council for Broadcast Digitization will 
complete 
its final report by 27 April. Already in the interim report 
published in December 1993, the council had recommended the 
adaptation of digital technology which has the capability of 
transmitting larger volumes of data than past systems, while the 
final report is expected to include government implementing 
plans aimed at the adaptation of digital broadcasting. 
  The final report will introduce the fact that the 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is promoting 
establishment of a standard for digital broadcasting with a 
target of 1996. The final report will conclude that "There is a 
need, domestically, to standardize technical aspects of the 
program by 1996," in order to avoid being left behind by the 
international community. 
  Transition to digital broadcasting will require several 
stages and standardizing the technology will be the first step. 
Broadcasting-related industries fear a drop in sales of current 
analog-based products and are reluctant to assume a clear-cut 
stand on the intent to convert to digital broadcasting, but the 
final report will have the objective of enhancing the desire of 
manufacturers of communications equipment and domestic 
appliances to develop digital-technology equipment by specifying 
a timetable for establishing standards for digitization.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications-sponsored "Research Council for Broadcast 
Digitization," a private research council of the Broadcast 
Administration Bureau director and chaired by Academic 
Information Center Director Hiroshi Inose, completed its final 
report on 27 April. Aside from specifying the standardization of 
broadcasting formats, which will be the first stage for shifting 
to next-generation broadcasting, by 1996, the report is 
characterized by the proposal to establish a "frequency band 
licensing system" which utilizes the special features of digital 
systems. Controversy surrounding the proposed review of 
high-vision systems will serve to stimulate a resumption of 
debate concerning next-generation broadcasting systems which had 
reached a stalemate. 
  In contrast to analog broadcasting which can transmit voice 
and images only, digital broadcasting can accurately transmit 
large volumes of data and software. As an example, broadcasting 
over multiple channels and installing two-way capabilities will 
enable services such as in-home medical care, home shopping, and 
broadcasting of games. 
  In connection with such digitization of broadcasting, the 
report introduces the status in Europe and the United States 
where work is in progress relative to systems standardization. 
The report provides the assessment that the goal of the United 
States and European nations is to work for the smooth 
implementation of the international standards for digital 
satellite broadcasting being promoted by the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU), a subordinate agency of the 
United Nations, with a target date of 1996. The report stresses 
the need to accelerate work on the standardization of systems in 
Japan where movements are taking place to prepare for the 
implementation of digital broadcasting via communications 
satellites. 
  Further, the report criticizes the disadvantages of the 
current licensing system which discriminates between radio and 
television broadcasting. The report concludes that if digital 
systems are adopted, there will be a need to use a system of 
licensing based on frequency bands, to enable flexibility and 
versatility in offering services such as for television 
broadcasting, video and data transmission and telephone 
communication.

Kawahara] 
  [Text] An increasing number of financial institutions seek 
to dispose of bad loans through court-administered auctions. 
This is because they have concluded that there is no other 
method but to use the auction system in disposing of collateral 
real estate where claims concerning the property present a legal 
entanglement. However, the recession in real estate markets has 
made buyers very reluctant to make offers. The Ministry of 
Finance intends to authorize financial institutions to establish 
subsidiaries for the purpose of placing winning bids for 
properties to facilitate the disposition of bad loans through 
auctions, but in the final analysis, subsidiaries will 
eventually face the need to dispose of the collateral real 
estate, which means that fundamental resolution of the bad loan 
issue will be extended into the distant future. 
  Increasing applications for auctions by financial 
institutions are apparent in the Tokyo area. According to a 
survey by the Tokyo District Court, applications in Tokyo's 23 
wards in 1993 totaled 5,543 cases, the highest on record. The 
Tokyo District Court states, "Most of the increase came as a 
result of applications from financial institutions." And, a 
source at a trust bank comments, "Increasing numbers of 
applications are from leading banks, which would have been 
unthinkable in the past." 
  Banks have the option of disposing of bad loans 
collateralized with real estate by transferring them to the 
Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company, but that option requires 
the consent of all creditors when there is more than one. 
Accordingly, when claims present a complex situation, auctions 
are an effective method of disposal. 
  However, in reality, in contrast to the sharp increase in 
applications for auctions, progress in the disposal of bad loans 
through auctions is extremely slow. 
  One credit union in Tokyo applied to the Tokyo District 
Court 
for auction of a building owned by an import-export firm in 
Daito ward in the winter of 1992. The credit union had issued a 
loan of 350 million yen and held a third-lien mortgage. The 
credit union had expected that "some real estate firm would 
promptly place a winning bid for the property and that losses 
would be minimal," because it good-quality property located near 
JR [Japan Railways] Okachimachi Station, but no buyer has been 
found despite three auctions and 18 months after the initial 
application, the property is undergoing additional auctions. 
  The minimum acceptable bid for the first auction was set at 
2.5 billion yen, but the current value has dropped by 20-30 
percent and the credit union is resigned to a situation where 
"We would be happy if we could recover 100 million yen." And, it 
is said that mortgagers such as credit associations with 
lower-ranking liens "will not be able recover even a penny." 
  A total of five financial institutions such as city banks, 
credit unions, and credit associations had loaned 4.5 billion 
yen to this export-import firm. The company-owned building which 
was used as collateral had a market value of about 5 billion 
yen. No buyers exist, even with the price atl less than half of 
the collateralized value, thus demonstrating why the bad loan 
issue cannot be readily resolved even through the use of 
auctions. 
  Another problem is that applications exceed court capacity. 
An increase in the number of applications for auctions results 
in a lengthy wait for the initial auction and there is a dearth 
of developers willing to place winning bids. The result is a 
lengthy process from auction application filings to receipt of 
actual winning bids and recovery of loans. A source at one city 
financial institution complains, "Not one bid has been received 
for properties placed on auction during fiscal year 1993." 
Moreover, the situation is such that hardly any of the 
properties placed for auction in fiscal year 1992 and into the 
second year have been sold. 
  District courts in Tokyo and Osaka have increased staffing 
substantially in fiscal year 1994 to cope with the situation. 
However, since applications for auctions are expected to 
increase in the future, there is skepticism about any potential 
for faster processing of applications. 
  Even in the case of auctions, which are generally considered 
as having the potential to dispose of all claims, there are 
aspects which are not covered by law. When a property is being 
leased and is the subject of a winning bid, the current lessee 
need not vacate the property for three years in the case of a 
building and for five years in the case of land. Recently, there 
has been an increase in the number of cases where that right is 
abused. Mortgagees who learn of moves by the financial 
institutions to auction collateral property sign leases with 
friends and interfere with auctions using the lessee rights as a 
legal basis. Such situations pose a nuisance to any developer 
who hopes to place a winning bid. 
  Here is a sample case taking place in "T" city in the Tokyo 
metropolitan area. An unknown individual built a shanty and is 
exercising squatter's rights on a piece of land within the city 
that a bank was about to place on the auction block. When bank 
officials inspected the land, the squatter insisted that he had 
a lease and refused to move. The bank auctioned the land despite 
his presence, but developers hesitated to place bids because 
large parcels involve carrying costs if they cannot be resold 
expeditiously. Since the probability is high that the lessee 
will exercise squatter's rights even after the lease expires, 
any party placing a winning bid would need to undertake legal 
removal proceedings, which means that a buyer will be difficult 
to find. 
  Some properties that fail to sell at auction are being 
disposed of by the filing of winning bids by affiliated or dummy 
firms set up by financial institutions, using funds from the 
parent institution. 
  The Tokyo District Court concludes that, "for the most part, 
properties exceeding 100 million yen in value are subject to the 
`sole-bidder process.'" The procedure symbolizes the banking 
industry's dilemma of having no choice but to amortize bad loans 
in the absence of buyers.

Kawahara] 
  [Text] "Subsidiaries set up for the purpose of tendering 
the winning sole bid" are inspiring expectations among financial 
institutions facing difficulties with the disposal of bad loans 
that "we'll be able to unashamedly place winning bids without 
the need to face criticism for concealing losses." 
  On 11 March the Ministry of Finance [MOF], at its bank 
department chief-sponsored "Seminar on Enhancing Liquidity of 
Loans," presented detailed plans for use by city bank officials 
to facilitate the disposal of real estate used as collateral for 
bad loans. The detailed plans involve the disposal of bad loans 
through establishment by financial institutions of wholly owned 
subsidiaries to specialize in placement of sole bids for 
collateralized real estate. According to an attendee at the 
seminar, the MOF is expected to approve the first "sole-bidder 
subsidiary" as early as May. 
  Under the MOF plan, this "sole-bidder subsidiary" would use 
the sole-bidder system of the courts, hold and administer the 
acquired real estate for a specified period and then resell the 
property. In addition to enhancing the liquidity of 
collateralized real estate, the real estate purchased by the 
subsidiary can be redeveloped to prevent a further drop in value 
of the collateralized real estate. 
  The ultimate advantage of establishing a sole-bidder 
subsidiary by financial institutions is that any collateral 
property placed on auction will be sold. According to a source 
at a city bank, "There's a major advantage in being able to 
dispose of collateralized real estate on bad loans where claims 
are legally complex." Properties purchased by subsidiaries will 
be removed from the balance sheets of parent companies and will 
result in progress in the disposition of bad loans. 
  However, it appears that many financial institutions assume 
a 
cautious posture on the question of actually establishing a 
sole-bidder subsidiary, saying, "We will examine the idea 
carefully upon issuance of the MOF circular. 
  An official of a trust bank expresses doubt, saying, "The 
process has definite appeal, but disposal through auctions is 
too time-consuming." There's also the view that, "if it takes 
one or two years to dispose of bad loans which we hope to sell 
at an early date, there's the risk of upsetting our plans." 
  Even if the MOF circular is issued, establishment of 
subsidiaries will require a preparatory period and the view is 
that subsidiaries will not begin to operate until after summer. 
Sources point out that "there is little potential for successful 
bids by subsidiaries on property already out for auction, thus 
making it impossible to dispose of property in time for the 
September midyear accounting reports." 
  Moreover, the subsidiaries will be allowed to bid for 
collateralized real estate of parent banks for a period of only 
five years and the subsidiaries will be limited to a lifespan of 
10 years. 
  There's also the problem of limitations in the scope of 
activities allowed. In contrast to the MOF plan to approve 
activities to facilitate disposal of real property, such as the 
purchase of contiguous land, improvement of parcels, and 
completion of construction in progress, the Fair Trade 
Commission seeks to impose restrictions on the MOF plan in view 
of the "need to limit activities of the subsidiaries to clearly 
distinguish them from regular real estate businesses." 
  If the subsidiaries are allowed to redevelop real estate 
which they purchased through the sole-bidder process, it would 
facilitate the disposal of such properties. If they are not 
allowed to redevelop properties, then the result may well be 
that "the subsidiaries will not be able to sell properties and 
will incur holding costs since they were properties that no one 
wanted to begin with." 
  The question is whether the subsidiaries going to become 
major players following the Cooperative Credit Purchasing 
Company? The financial institutions are in the process of 
considering the MOF-proposed special-purpose company (SPC) 
format for the purpose of establishing liquidity in loans on 
which interest payments have been eliminated or reduced, but it 
appears that all these concepts merely expand the "options" for 
bad debt disposal without ensuring any meaningful progress.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has compiled 
the results of an on-site survey concerning the European 
research data network which it conducted jointly with the 
Ministries of Education, International Trade and Industry, Posts 
and Telecommunications, Health and Welfare, and Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries. According to the survey, a move is 
accelerating to expand the network throughout Europe beyond 
national and agency precincts to provide for effective use of 
research resources and the operational and maintenance systems 
for the network should be of interest to Japan. The STA will 
step up its dialogue with Europe with a view to connecting 
Japan's research data network with the European network. 
  According to the survey report, there are two research data 
networks which cover the European region, including "E-Bone" 
which has grown from what was once a grass-roots-type network 
and "Europa NET" which was built under the sponsorship of the 
European Commission. Both have been in existence for one or two 
years since beginning official operations, but it is said that 
"There is a need to watch future developments and trends in 
various nations and agencies." The two systems utilize data 
bases such as a research and development data system known as 
"CORDIS" maintained and offered for use in a broad range of 
applied research and considered necessary for future use by 
Japan. 
  Dialogue between the survey group and the European 
Commission 
produced a desire for future reciprocal linkage and conduct of 
joint research by Japan, the United States and Europe in 
expanding Japan's research data network. Further, France 
expressed the opinion that, "Since U.S. influence is 
disproportionately strong in the area of research data networks, 
it is important that Europe and Asia exert greater effort in 
collaborating with each other."

  [Text] Blueprint for Post-Heisei Recession Period 
  When one era ends, the systems, customs, and ideas that 
sustained the era shackle progress in the ensuing era. 
  A classic example is erstwhile macroeconomic policy. Postwar 
Japan modernized the economy with the national objective of 
catching up with Europe and the United States. Pursuit of that 
objective involved adoption of fiscal and financial policies 
which gave highest priority to the development and growth of 
industry. Tax systems were designed with a variety of provisions 
favoring businesses. Favorable treatment of savings unheard of 
in other parts of the world were adopted to ensure the recycling 
of family savings into the industrial sector. 
  Comprehensive implementation of macroeconomic policies of 
this nature which favored industry resulted in spectacular 
growth for Japan in a short period. 
  However, macroeconomic policies of the past, which 
functioned 
so well during the catch-up era, are no longer very effective 
now that we have passed the catch-up era. And, there is more to 
the problem. The former macroeconomic policies are creating a 
series of problems that are bound to become obstacles to future 
economic growth. Such problems are countless and include 
accumulation of huge international balance-of-payments 
surpluses, international economic friction, the lowest housing 
standards of principal leading nations, and price levels which 
are high when compared to other nations. 
<H5>  Limitations of Erstwhile Macroeconomic Policies </H5>
  Macroeconomic policies of the past were designed so as to 
accumulate savings necessary for industrial growth. However, 
continuation of economic growth led by exports has become 
difficult and industrial capital demand has declined sharply, 
while savings have increased and international 
balance-of-payments surpluses have continued to accumulate. 
  If we are to learn from these lessons, it is obvious that 
the 
economic policy to be adopted by Japan in the post-Heisei 
recession period should be a modification of the excessive 
savings habits. The most unattractive aspect of Japan, which 
supposedly built an affluent society, is its low housing 
standards centered in urban areas. Especially urgent in our 
nation which is about to usher in a senior citizen society is 
the construction and expansion of residential capital stock. 
  From an international viewpoint, we must work expeditiously 
to establish an economic system which will enable us to coexist 
with the rest of the world. There is no way that Japan with a 
15-percent share of the world's gross national product (GNP) can 
survive by isolating itself from the rest of the world. 
  Aggressive deployment of a new macroeconomic policy which 
corrects imbalances between savings and investment as an 
alternative to earlier macroeconomic policies will guarantee 
economic growth led by domestic demand and reduce international 
balance-of-payments surpluses. Attainment of those results will 
require special emphasis on the following three points on a mid- 
and long-term basis: 
  First, we address reform of tax systems. The government Tax 
Council is playing a central role in studying a plant to 
decrease and increase taxes which combines an income tax cut and 
consumption tax hike. I too believe that in the face of the 
pending arrival of the senior citizen society, modification of 
the direct and indirect taxing ratios should be effected in the 
interests of stabilizing overall tax revenues. However, I am 
opposed to any modification of direct and indirect taxing ratios 
which calls for an "overall increase in taxes," as strongly 
advocated by some quarters of the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. In 
terms of modifying the direct and indirect tax ratio, it would 
probably be acceptable to see a result that would produce 
"neither an increase nor a decrease on an overall basis." 
However, it is desirable that the ratios be modified so that the 
result is an "overall decrease in taxes" in order to enhance the 
soundness of our consumer markets which lack vitality. This 
approach is presented with the idea that it will enhance the 
expansion of domestic demand and lead to an improvement in the 
savings-investment balance. 
  As an offset for deficiencies in tax revenues, we should 
probably consider a further cut in fiscal spending and a boost 
in tax revenues through comprehensive taxation of special income 
categories such as interest income. Further, we must not lose 
sight of the need to exert efforts at increased tax revenues 
attained through economic growth by means of putting the economy 
back on a stable growth track. 
  Second, we address a fundamental revision of the public 
works 
program. Already, the industrial infrastructure has been built 
to a considerable extent in terms of roads, harbors, bridges, 
and railways. Any uncontrolled expansion of public works 
spending based on past categories could lead to a waste of 
resources. 
  On the other hand, there has been a major expansion in the 
investment needs for construction and expansion of new social 
capital required in Japan for the future. For example, as 
mentioned in previous installments of this editorial series 
titled "Blueprint for Post-Heisei Recession Period," they 
include constructing a next-generation information-communication 
infrastructure, organizing transportation systems incorporating 
needs of the senior citizen society, building medical and 
nursing systems, establishing a worldwide environmental 
protection infrastructure, and developing advanced technology 
and equipment and systems for pollution measures. Use of current 
categories of public works programs would preclude effective 
fulfillment of these new kinds of needs. 
  The two major classifications of national construction bonds 
and national deficit bonds are no longer compatible with current 
conditions for issuance of national debt instruments. It is 
difficult to place research and development funds used for basic 
research which is significantly tied to the future Japanese 
economy under the two categoies of bonds used in the past. We 
should actively invest public funds in the public sector for 
social needs even if they do not result in the building of 
tangible assets such as roads and bridges. 
<H5>  Let Us Make Housing With 100-Year Lifespans </H5>
  Third, we address implementation of bold, preferential 
policies for residential investments. 
  Housing built in Japan in the past was of a meager quality 
which barely exceeded the definition of durable consumer goods. 
Quality of housing was affected by the high cost of residential 
construction, including the cost of land and the government's 
housing policy which emphasized the idea that "housing was 
acceptable as long as it was habitable." Such a policy was 
tolerable when Japan was a poor nation. 
  However, in the future there is a need to supply durable 
homes which will last about 100 years. Such homes will lead to 
the creation of comfortable, high-quality residential 
environments. It would be desirable to attain that goal by 
stimulating investments in homes by emulating the method used by 
the United States in encouraging housing construction after 
World War II by exempting from taxes the income used for 
interest charges on home loans. 
  The foremost obstacle which can be visualized in 
implementing 
macroeconomic policies which emphasize the correction of 
imbalances between savings and investments will probably be past 
forms of bureaucratic systems and bureaucratic concepts. Strong 
political leadership will be indispensable in overcoming such 
barriers. Having said that, it must be obvious as to the 
direction of economic policy to be assumed by the new Hata 
government, the second cabinet following abandonment of the 
"1955 political system."

  [Text] As was the case in the spring of last year, 
optimistic forecasts and assessments are being widely circulated 
that the Japanese economy has finally hit bottom and is in the 
process of rebounding after a long recession; even monetary 
authorities are saying that the economy is nearing the bottom, 
despite a persistent slowing of the growth in money supply. 
However, we must review the situation with a strict distinction 
between the desire for the economy to improve and whether 
objective conditions exist that substantiate a rebound in the 
economy. 
<H5>  Voodoo Economics </H5>
  If we were to merely piece together fragments of favorable 
data, we would not be able to remove ourselves from the purview 
of voodoo economics. Whether the data are favorable or 
unfavorable, we must begin with a process of gaining an accurate 
picture of the current situation in order to begin a debate 
about the proper economic countermeasures. 
  Such an approach requires that we engage in analysis and 
debate covering the basics of macroeconomics and analysis of 
personal income. Fundamental macroeconomics teaches the basic 
relationship that, if the combined investments of the private 
sector and public works grow, production and incomes will grow 
after a time lag, and that an expansion in incomes will result 
in the growth of private-sector consumption. 
  About one year after the start of the sharp drop in stock 
prices at the beginning of 1990, despite the increase in public 
works investments, the sharp decline in private-sector 
investments led to a start in sluggishness in overall 
investments and one year thereafter the gross domestic product 
(GDP) became sluggish. Both private-sector consumption and GDP 
became sluggish at the same time. 
  Even the economic decline of the latter half of fiscal year 
1993, which was unexpected by government authorities and the 
majority of economic commentators, should not have been any 
surprise as long as they were dispassionately observing the 
significance of the sharp drop in capital investments and sharp 
decline in overall investments owing to untimely economic 
measures which took place in the second half of 1992. 
  It was readily obvious that arguments that fiscal expansion 
had no effect on the economy were in error. Economic measures 
were definitely not taken in a timely manner. However, if the 
public works investment increases ordered under economic 
measures had not taken place, overall investment declines would 
have been much sharper and the economic situation would have 
been much worse. 
  Those who argue that fiscal expansion had no effect on the 
economy assert that fiscal expansion caused domestic interest 
rates to rise, led to a stronger yen, caused a decline in demand 
for imports, and negated benefits of demand expansion effects of 
fiscal policy. 
  However, those were the results of inadequate monetary 
relaxation measures taken in response to fiscal expansion and 
were not of a nature that could be directly tied to the 
ineffectiveness of fiscal policy. 
<H5>  Attention Focused on Overall Investment Trends </H5>
  The question now is, what can we project in the way of 
trends 
for GDP if we focus on overall investments? 
  A survey of capital investment plans for a variety of 
categories indicates that the growth in capital investments will 
fall to an annual negative growth rate of 5 percent to 10 
percent. Residential investments represent about 33 percent of 
the overall capital investments, while recent rises in 
residential loan interest rates are expected to bring housing 
growth to a standstill, and, when combined with overall capital 
investments, will have no major effect on private-sector 
investment trends. 
  Public works investments are expected to grow at an annual 
rate of 10-20 percent. They grew about 15 percent over the prior 
year period between the second and fourth quarters of 1993. 
  If the growth rates for private-sector investments and 
public 
works investments are simulated on the basis of the foregoing 
expectations, we can arrive at the growth rate for overall 
investments. 
  The economic outlook based on the most optimistic overall 
investment forecasts indicates that GDP growth will be moderate. 
<H5>  Strong Yen May Call for Downward Revision </H5>
  At issue here is that the survey of capital investments 
published thus far does not reflect the potential for downward 
revision of capital investment plans based on the strong yen 
beginning in the middle of February 1994. Actual capital 
investments are running at a rate 10 percent below the projected 
low range. They will probably run along the same trendline in 
fiscal year 1994 as a result of downward revisions. 
  Additionally, if public works investment growth is estimated 
at 15 percent on an interim basis and we arrive at an average 
overall investment scenario, fiscal year 1994 will witness a 
further decline and the possibility of further worsening in the 
economy. Further, when one considers the delay in the approval 
of the fiscal year 1994 budget and that public works investment 
growth in fiscal year 1993 fell below 15 percent, there is the 
major possibility that overall investments will fall below the 
average scenario levels.

  [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) has 
fabricated a prototype amplifier IC [integrated circuit] for use 
in converting optically transmitted data into electrical 
signals. It is capable of processing signals in the 60 gigahertz 
(one gigahertz is equal to 1 billion hertz) frequency range. The 
new IC substantially exceeds the capacity of old IC's which were 
limited to processing signals with a maximum speed of 40 
gigahertz. The new IC will enable the manufacture of repeaters 
for basic circuits and can be used in future transmission of 
multimedia data. 
  The newly developed IC will restore, prior to reproduction 
and reprocessing, signals weakened through optical transmission 
to a level where they can be used in microprocessors (MPU). It 
incorporates indium phosphorous high electron mobility 
transistor (HEMT) structures and is capable of handling 
broadband signals. 
  The new IC also incorporates a dedicated circuit for 
accurate 
restoration of low frequency signals. In so doing, it possesses 
the capability to restore signals of a broad band up to 60 hertz 
to electrical signals with a high degree of efficiency from 
direct current. 
  Further, when the newly developed IC is used to fabricate an 
amplifier, the wavelengths are shortened as the frequencies rise 
and resonate inside the amplifier and accelerate the emission of 
static. NTT coped with that problem by conducting a 
three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation based on a finite 
allocation formula to arrive at the optimum configuration for 
the amplifier. The result of this procedure was a prototype 
which measures 20 mm in length, 25 mm in width, and 14 mm in 
height. 
  High-volume transmission of data over optical communication 
systems requires either an increase in the number of optical 
fibers or expansion of the signal band width. The new IC falls 
in the latter category and can be used in the future for 
transmission of high data volume for purposes such as multimedia. 
  In the future NTT hopes to develop systems which can handle 
signals in the tera (one tera equals 1 trillion) bits range by 
fabricating prototype amplifiers of a higher capacity with two 
of the new IC's linked in tandem.

  [Text] Hitachi will launch local production in the United 
States of core equipment for next-generation communication 
networks such as superhigh-speed optical transmission systems 
(SONET) and asynchronous transmission mode (ATM)-related 
equipment. The program will call for a threefold increase in 
personnel and a sales goal of 50 billion yen for fiscal year 
1998 for the local subsidiary. In the United States, telephone 
companies and cable television (CATV) companies are building 
high-speed digital communication networks compatible with the 
"information super highway concept" and demand for 
next-generation communication equipment has risen sharply. 
Hitachi hopes to preclude trade friction through local 
production and assume an aggressive marketing stance in this new 
field. 
  SONET and ATM switching equipment encompass a variety of 
communication equipment used for high-speed transmission of not 
only voice and character but images as well. Production will be 
in charge of Hitachi's local subsidiary, Hitachi Telecom USA, 
headed by President Makoto Suzuki and located in Atlanta, 
Georgia, which currently handles the production of private 
branch exchanges (PBX) in the United States. Capital expansion 
will involve investments in the range of 4 to 5 billion yen and 
if the project goes well, production will start by the end of 
the year. 
  The program will involve an increase in Hitachi Telecom's 
employees from the current level of 130 to about 400 by fiscal 
year 1996 mostly through appointment of local hires. 
  This will be the first time that Hitachi markets SONET 
systems. Executives of the company say, "We are receiving many 
inquiries from U.S. communications companies." The company's 
sales objective for the transmission sector for fiscal year 1998 
is 35 billion yen. 
  At the end of last year, Hitachi received an order for ATM 
multiplexing systems in the area of ATM-related equipment from 
Time-Warner for use in two-way CATV service systems. The seven 
units for which orders were received at that time were 
manufactured domestically and have already been delivered. In 
the future, manufacture of all products destined for the United 
States will be completely transferred to Hitachi Telecom as a 
means of avoiding trade friction. The sales objective for fiscal 
year 1998 is roughly 15 billion yen. 
  Hitachi hopes to increase its market presence in the face of 
rapid developments in the multimedia sector and attendant growth 
in market potential for next-generation communications 
networking businesses.

  [Text] On the 27th Mitsui and Information Resources (IRIC 
of Chicago), a U.S. information services company, agreed to form 
a joint venture in Japan. The joint venture will engage in the 
contract analysis of point-of-sale (POS) data and attendant 
consulting services offered to retailers and manufacturers. The 
joint venture was entered into under the assessment that 
U.S.-style leading-edge data analysis know-how could play a 
useful role in Japan amidst rapid changes taking place in the 
marketing field based on manufacturer-retailer collaboration. 
  The joint venture will assume the provisional name of "Japan 
Information Resources." Capitalization has not been determined 
thus far, but ownership will be set at 60 percent for IRIC and 
40 percent for Mitsui. The new venture will contract with super 
markets, drug stores and clothing chains to gather on-line POS 
data. It will contract to analyze sales trends for retail 
outlets as well as furnish advice on changes in categorical 
sales data and appropriate stockage levels based on a 
cross-section of data. 
  The venture will also have the capability to measure changes 
in sales trends based on modifications to display methods and 
price cuts and the scope and effectiveness of promotional 
gimmicks offered by manufacturers such as discount coupons and 
flyers. Additionally, the joint venture will engage in 
comprehensive consulting projects such as linking manufacturers, 
wholesalers and retailers into optimum marketing systems. 
  In U.S. marketing circles, POS systems and on-line receiving 
and order systems are integrated to provide for rapid reaction 
to changes in sales patterns and to reduce marketing costs. IRIC 
plays a behind-the-scenes role and maintains data networks with 
retailers and manufacturers. 
  On the other hand, Mitsui will use the joint venture to 
establish collaborative relationships with domestic 
manufacturers and retailers. Mitsui also intends to use the 
joint venture to acquire additional clients for its own 
marketing network.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation [MEC] has organized 
a research team charged with a research program for a new air 
defense system. The United States has been calling on Japan to 
participate in the research program of the theater missile 
defense [TMD] to cope with ballistic missiles developed by North 
Korea. At the present stage, Japan has yet to decide on whether 
to participate in the research program, but building an air 
defense system is expected to be a task in the plan for defense 
buildup to be implemented after 1996. MEC plans to undertake a 
wide range of research on radar, antimissile missile, and 
command communications network. 
  The research team is comprised of about 20 engineers mainly 
from MEC's Kamakura Plant (in Kamakura City, Kanakawa 
Prefecture), and they are in charge of missile, communications, 
and fire control system in their respective divisions. 
  The TMD, which the United States plans to develop, is a 
system which will make phased interceptions of enemy missiles 
with various missiles deployed on the ground and at sea after 
satellites detect their launching. However, Japan adheres to the 
principle of using space for peaceful purposes, and Japanese 
experts are divided over the use of satellites to detect their 
launching. MEC will examine two options -- the new air defense 
system that uses satellites and the one which does not use 
satellites. 
  MEC is now working on the development of "a new medium-range 
SAM," the next-generation surface-to-air missile for the Ground 
Self-Defense Force. It has manufactured missiles along with 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba Corporation. MEC, which 
has developed a high-performance aircraft radar, will certainly 
participate in the TMD development program as a key Japanese 
partner once Japan decides to participate in it. MEC says, "At 
the present stage, we are studying various theoretical 
problems." It plans to vigorously propose to the Defense Agency 
the building of the new air defense system. 
  The United States is said to have estimated the cost of 
developing the TMD at approximately $30 billion (approximately 3 
trillion yen). It has asked Japan to participate in the 
development program through: 1) the purchase of U.S.-built air 
defense system; 2) financial cooperation; or 3) joint 
development.

unofficially decided to appoint Noboru Hoshuyama, director of 
the DA Director General's Secretariat, to replace Ichiro 
Yoneyama, director general of the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency [DFAA], who will shortly be retiring 
voluntarily. Masahiro Akiyama, chief of the DA's Bureau of 
Finance, is expected to fill Hoshuyama's post. The director 
general of the DFAA is the second-highest bureaucratic post in 
the DA. As a result of this personnel reshuffling, Naoaki 
Murata, chief of the DA's Bureau of Defense Policy, is expected 
to be promoted to administrative vice minister of the DA since 
incumbent DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama is 
expected to leave this post next year. 
  Hoshuyama graduated from Waseda University in 1963, majoring 
in politics and economics. He then entered the DA. After 
serving as DA counselor and chief of the DA Bureau of Finance, 
he assumed the post of director of the DA Director General's 
Secretariat in July 1993. Fifty-seven-year-old Hoshuyama hails 
from Oita Prefecture.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on future 
Diet steering on 8 May, saying: "When I think of the situation 
Japan is in, I feel that we have to approve the budget as soon 
as possible. We need not only reforms, but also cooperation with 
other parties." It seems that his remark indicates that Hata 
decided he has no choice but to seek cooperation with the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] over the issue of the draft for redrawing 
single-seat electoral districts for the House of Representatives 
and other issues to approve the fiscal 1994 budget, which is the 
most urgent task. 
  On his responsibility as a person who appointed former 
justice minister, the prime minister stated: "By doing some 
soul-searching regarding the past history, Japan will candidly 
apologize for what it did and teach next generations. We will 
show our resolve by exerting efforts to prevent tragedies like 
war."

  [Text] On 1 May, Former Deputy Prime Minister Michio 
Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] unveiled a plan 
to promote "reforms tantamount to dissolving the party." He has 
been strongly urging the need to regenerate the party. The plan 
is composed of four pillars, including plans to fundamentally 
review the party platform and actively promote young LDP 
members. Watanabe plans to present his plan to LDP President 
Yohei Kono following the Golden Week holiday. 
  When he decided to abandon his plans to run for the 
premiership and to secede from the LDP, Watanabe met with Kono. 
At the meeting, Watanabe stressed the need to reform the party, 
saying: "We need reform that is equivalent to forming a new 
party." He expressed a strong sense of crisis because the LDP, 
while running the government for so many years, had 
bureaucratized personnel matters as well as party organizations, 
thus losing its vitality. 
  His plan calls for: 1) a drastic review of the party 
platform 
which dates from the Cold War era; 2) promoting young and 
promising members; 3) streamlining LDP headquarters by 
reorganizing party organs; and 4) activating local organizations 
and strengthening cooperative ties between local organizations 
and headquarters. In particular, he explains the "need to find 
promising people" by abolishing the long-established seniority 
system, under which cabinet posts were allocated to those who 
had been elected to the Diet more than five or six times. 
Moreover, he urges the need to reduce the number of people 
working at headquarters, trim expenses, and review local and 
other small organizations. He also urges the need to intensify 
headquarters' daily activities. 
  At its general meeting held on 27 April, the Watanabe 
faction 
decided to map out concrete plans to reform the party. However, 
the faction did that to flesh out "Watanabe's private proposal." 
After the Watanabe faction completes its work and maps out 
concrete plans, Watanabe intends to strongly urge Kono and the 
LDP executive department to bring about reform.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the the </F>
Social Democratic Party of Japan, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with 
the new Hata administration? 
  [Murayama] In dealing with each and every issue, we will 
take a free and unbiased approach. Since the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] has had a part in drawing up the fiscial 
1994 budget, we have our responsibilities toward the people. 
Therefore, we will cooperate with the cabinet in enacting the 
budget and other relevant bills. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The idea of forming a parliamentary 
group with Sakigake [Harbinger] and other parties has been 
mentioned. What do you think of it? 
  [Murayama] I would give a positive consideration to the 
idea. I would like to have formal talks with Sakigake when the 
long consecutive holidays are over. Topics to be discussed will 
include holding party heads' talks and forming an organ for 
consultations. 
<H5>  SDPJ-LDP Cooperation Is Different From Realignment </H5>
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In organizing a parliamentary group, 
will you also consider inviting political parties other than 
Sakigake? 
  [Murayama] We would like to cooperate with anyone, and it 
does not matter whether they belong to the Japan New Party or 
the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. We have had troubles with 
the DSP but we were orginal partners in working out plans to get 
all the liberal Social Democrats together. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How about your relations with the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]? 
  [Murayama] I think we should cooperate with each other in 
promoting the Diet operations. However, it has to be separated 
from the issue on regrouping of political parties. In other 
words, the point at issue lies in how various political forces 
will be regrouped. And in actually promoting the Diet 
operations, we will cooperate with the LDP on all the issues on 
which we can cooperate with each other. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Following the enactment of the budget 
bill, the LDP may call for a no-confidence vote in the cabinet. 
In that case, will the SDPJ act in concert? 
  [Murayama] It would be desirable to make the decision 
depending on the actual political situation at the time. At 
present, Japan is suffering from economic stagnation and we have 
various serious problems in both domestic and foreign affairs, 
with the major one being our relations with the United States. 
Therefore, it is preferable not to create a political vaccum at 
the moment. However, if the new cabinet should come to a 
deadlock and the only alternative left for the cabinet to break 
the deadlock is to dissolve the lower house, then I would say 
there is no other choice. 
Having Signed the Policy Accord, SDPJ Still Has Its 
Responsibilities [subhead] 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Among the major policy tasks, how do 
you intend to tackle the tax reforms issue? 
  [Murayama] Since the SDPJ did sign the policy accord in 
forming the new coalition government the other day, we still 
have our responsibilities. Our activities will no longer be 
restricted because we are no longer a member of the ruling 
coalition. However, it does not follow that we will start anew 
with a completely clean slate. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You will not change your position of 
tolerating an increase in the indirect tax rate. Is that right? 
  [Murayama] It should be based on the drastic revision of 
inequalities in the tax system and on reduction of the 
government expenditures. However, if the government should 
clearly indicate the amount of funds needed for promoting 
welfare measures for the country's aging population in the 
future, and then explain that revenues gained from increased 
indirect taxes will be used for this purpose, then I am sure it 
will be able to win the people's understanding about the tax 
reform. The point at issue lies in abruptly starting to 
increase the current consumption tax rate. No opposition has 
been voiced within our party to efforts to correct the ratio 
between direct and indirect taxes. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When will the SDPJ work out its 
final conclusion? 
  [Murayama] Since the party's tax system research council has 
already worked out guidelines, we would like to conduct 
full-scale intraparty discussions on the basis of these 
guidelines. I think our party plan will be worked out as early 
as in June when the ruling parties are going to work out their 
conclusions. 
<H5>  SDPJ Split Is Impossible </H5>
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How does the SDPJ plan to deal with 
the issue of suspected nuclear arms development by DPRK (North 
Korea)? 
  [Murayama] What is most important is to resolve this issue 
through talks. If there is anything that the SDPJ can be of 
service, we will do our best. Depending on the situation, a 
delegation may be dispatched to the DPRK. When we were a member 
of the ruling coalition, our activities were restricted. Now, 
we can act on the basis of our independent decision. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In the course of regrouping political 
parties or in dealing with major policies, is there any 
possibility that the intraparty confrontation between the 
rightist and leftist factions will become intensified? 
  [Murayama] There are various policy groups within the party. 
In the sense that they contribute to promoting the party's 
vitality, it is most desirable. However, it will be undesirable 
if their activities should go beyond the party's framework and 
lead to the split of the party. It should be noted that the 
whole party has taken concerted action in seceding from the 
coalition this time. Therefore, it is impossible for the SDPJ 
to split. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have you been considering any 
measures to increase the strength of the party executives? 
  [Murayama] We intend to give a briefing on the future course 
the party should take and once again call for achieving party 
unity at the Central Executive Committee session scheduled for 
late May.

  [Text] Darwin, Australia, May 3 (AFP) -- United States air 
force pilots, on air exercises over here, were acting like 
cowboys and should be stopped, a local political leader said 
Tuesday. 
  Recent manoeuvres involving US marines from the Japan-based 
Marine Group 12 have angered residents in this northern 
Australian city complaining about the noise and frequency of 
flights. 
  "If we cannot control these people, if we can't tell them 
they've got to abide by the rules that we set... if they won't 
do that, then they've got to stop coming," the Northern 
Territory's Labor opposition leader Brian Ede told national 
radio. 
  "We cannot allow people to decide that they're going to 
treat 
the Northern Territory (and) Darwin as though it is some place 
where they're going to have a bit of a jaunt." 
  Australia's Defence Minister Robert Ray has announced two 
separate studies into the noise effects of air exercises over 
Darwin, and the regional government also has instituted its own 
investigation. 
  Ede said some US pilots had left their flight paths and made 
flyovers across Darwin suburbs. 
  "We want an immediate ban on those cowboys," Ede said. 
  Ede's comments drew an angry reaction from the adjutant of 
Marine Group 12, Captain Iric Bressler. 
  "That's totally false," he said. "Our pilots have strict 
regulations. They fly off strict flight plans, and they go 
exactly where they're supposed to go and come back... I'm kind 
of irritated about it." 
  Earlier this month, it was revealed that, in March, two 
FA-18 
Hornet aircraft flown by the marines mistakenly dropped dummy 
bombs as close as 100 metres to a hut containing Americans and 
Australians. 
  A subsequent report into the incident at Delamere bombing 
range, about 350 kilometres (215 miles) south of here, blamed 
pilot error. 
  The US marines are due to leave here next week after three 
months of training.

  [Excerpts] A senior official in the United States has 
forecast the Asia Pacific region and Latin America offer the 
greatest potential for free trade. The predictions are made in 
a report by the American trade representative, Micky Kantor, 
which praises the Asia Pacific economic grouping, APEC. 
[passage from correspondent in New York omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Australian Government has warned that 
regional 
countries could suffer a loss of exports because of NAFTA. 
Concern about exports is among the main findings of the report 
by the Australian Foreign Affairs Department on the implications 
of NAFTA. The report said while the agreement could open new 
opportunities for Australian companies in North America, its 
overall effect will be mixed. 
  It said the main concern is that the United States, Canada, 
and Mexico will try to increase barriers to trade with other 
countries.

has opened an ASEAN-Australia forum in Canberra, predicting 
continued growth in links between ASEAN and Australia. It is 
the 16th ASEAN-Australia Forum and is being attended by more 
than 100 government officials and representatives of business. 
  Senator Evans told the forum he expects the growing 
relationship between Australia and the region to intensify over 
the next two years. 
  [Begin Evans recording] The trend in ASEAN-Australia 
relations is already clear. By 2014 we will be, I believe, 
significantly closer than even we are today, and forming 
something of a cohesive unit within a broader Asia-Pacific 
framework. 
  In a changing regional environment, I think we need to look 
to the future of ASEAN-Australia relations and develop further 
the structures and the linkages to sustain our political and 
economic relationship into the next century. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans, 
has called on Asia Pacific region countries to put pressure on 
North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. 
  Speaking at the ninth Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference in 
Sydney, Senator Evans said the situation in North Korea was 
worrying, but not at crisis point. He said a nuclear-armed 
North Korea would undermine confidence in the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and present a serious security 
threat to the region. 
  [Begin Evans recording] For the North Koreans, the choice is 
really a pretty straightforward and simple one -- to remain in 
the NPT and accept the disciplines of the treaty, including full 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards, or, 
alternatively, it can continue with its nuclear activities in 
violation of its treaty obligations and face not only almost 
universal international censure, but, in time, a package of 
severe and damaging sanctions. [end recording] 
  The five-day Sydney conference will discuss the latest 
developments in nuclear technology and the region's demand for 
nuclear energy over the next 50 years.

  [Text] Australia has announced the composition of the 
parliamentary delegation which will consult Vietnam on human 
rights. The one-week visit to Vietnam will start on 7 July and 
will be led by the chairman of the parliamentary standing 
committee on foreign affairs, defense, and trade, Stephen 
Loosley. The other two parliamentary members will be the 
opposition spokesman on foreign affairs Andrew Peacock and the 
Australian Democrats foreign affairs spokesman Vicky Vaughan. 
  The consultative delegation to look at human rights and 
other 
issues in the relationship was confirmed during the visit to 
Vietnam last month by Australia's prime minister Paul Keating. 
  Announcing the delegation's makeup, Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans said it would be accompanied by two academics noted for 
their expertise in Asian affairs and human rights and two 
prominent Vietnamese now living in Australia. 
  The academics are Professor Nancy Viviani, dean of faculty 
of 
the Asian studies at Queensland's Griffith University; and 
Professor Philip Olsten, director of the Center for 
International Law at the Australian National University. 
  Senator Evans said Australia had taken up the suggestion 
from 
the Vietnamese prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, made during his 
visit in May last year that Vietnamese Australians should go 
back to Vietnam to see the situation. 
  The foreign minister said the delegation will include Quang 
Luu, head of radio for the Special Broadcasting Service and Ho 
Mai, a Footscray city councillor in Melbourne. 
  Senator Evans said the delegation was a strong, 
well-balanced 
one that had 
both status and expertise.

<F P=106> [Commentary by economics correspondent Robert Garran and </F>
George Megalogenis entitled: "Cook Pictures Aggressive Push Into 
World Market"] 
  [Text] Australia is moving into a new era in industry 
policy aimed at pushing the nation into the global economy 
instead of providing help for particular industries, according 
to the Minister for Industry, Science, and Technology, Senator 
Cook. "In the last 10 years, we have been inward-looking, 
removing impediments and opening out our economy," Senator Cook 
told THE AUSTRALIAN yesterday in his first extended interview 
since taking over the portfolio in January. "The next 10 years 
is understanding the marketplace we're in, and being flexible 
enough to adapt to it and take advantage of it." For the first 
time, Senator Cook spelled out a detailed framework for the 
industry statement that will be part of the White Paper on 
employment to be delivered by the prime minister, Mr Keating, on 
May 4. 
  The statement will have two broad goals: to boost the 
competitiveness of local industry and to improve access to 
international markets. Cutting tariffs had largely forced 
industries trading in world markets to become competitive. In 
the non-traded goods sector, the important issues were 
micro-economic reform and competition policy, Senator Cook said. 
The agreement by the States to expose their business 
enterprises to more competition, by agreeing to the Hilmer 
report recommendations, was crucial in spurring micro-economic 
reform at a State level, he said. 
  The other important way to boost competition was to address 
the question of access to finance by small and medium-sized 
companies. "There will always be a fairly clamorous argument 
between the providers of finance and the seekers of finance," 
Senator Cook said. While the banks had all said they would do 
better by lending to small and medium-sized business the system 
could be improved. While he would not give details it is 
believed a package of finance measures will be a key part of the 
industry statement. It is expected to include an education 
campaign for both lenders and borrowers to overcome the 
traditional reliance on lending against assets without 
considering lending against cash flow, as well as improvements 
to pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds and more 
relaxed rules for direct bank investment in companies. Changes 
are also expected to enhance the role of the Commonwealth 
Development Bank which provides venture finance capital for 
small business. 
  Senator Cook also foreshadowed improvements to research and 
development incentives -- now a 150 per cent tax write-off. 
"There is a case for the Government to investigate how it 
encourages that investment to come sooner and quicker, in higher 
technology, in computer-aided manufacture, and to develop the 
necessary networks in industry in the small to medium-sized 
companies, to encourage them to embrace that with a bit more 
confidence," he said. The Government was still considering 
whether to give incentives to multinational firms to set up 
regional headquarters in Australia. Senator Cook outlined a 
two-pronged strategy to boost industry access to foreign 
markets: improved access to advice from Austrade and on other 
government schemes and bodies, and a bigger effort, after 
completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, to reach 
bilateral trade agreements, especially with Asian countries. It 
was also important for Australia to encourage both China and 
Taiwan to join the new World Trade Organization, he said. 
Senator Cook's strategy builds on the past decade, when 
industry policy was dominated by former industry minister Mr 
John Button, whose chief goal was to manage the dismantling of 
the tariff wall around Australian industry.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "At Last the New World Trade Order"] </F>
  [Text] No country has worked harder than Australia to 
obtain agreement for the more liberal trading arrangements to be 
signed tonight into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
As initiator and chair of the Cairns Group, which drew together 
a lobby of like-minded traders to raise a more influential voice 
among the giants of world trade, Australia has been diligent, 
consistent, and tenacious in its advocacy for the new regime. 
  The doubting and protectionist nations have not been 
vanquished: they remain formidable and will continue to attempt 
unilateral, managed trade where it suits them. Some of the 
sectors incorporated into the GATT have still to be determined 
properly, and while fears of a world broken into exclusionary 
trading blocs have lessened, that threat has not disappeared. 
It remains to be seen how committed regional associations such 
as the European Community and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement will be to giving precedence to the multilateral GATT. 
  But for all its faults the GATT, to come into effect next 
year through a permanent governing body, the World Trade 
Organization [WTO], is a powerful instrument for global 
enrichment. Fairly employed, it is capable of benefiting every 
signatory nation and could increase the value of export 
production by $325 billion [currency not specified] a year. To 
give one illustration, French consumers who last year watched 
their nation's farmers do their destructive best to thwart the 
deal will enjoy a cheaper and wider range of goods on their 
supermarket shelves, courtesy of a reduction in subsidies and 
enhanced competition emanating from trade freedoms. 
  Despite the failure to achieve as much as the free traders 
had sought during the seven years of hard bargaining that 
constituted the Uruguay Round, Australia and its fellow groupers 
can claim a significant triumph out of this week's ceremonies in 
Marrakesh. Our representative at the 125-nation conference is 
the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. But among all the 
Australians who deserve personal credit and recognition for 
their long-term roles in the negotiations two especially stand 
out: former trade minister Mr John Dawkins and senior 
negotiator Mr Peter Field. Next month the Cairns Group will 
assemble to consider its future. There have been occasional 
rifts - in the latest, Australia is quite rightly threatening to 
take one of its fellow members, Canada, to the WTO because 
Canada has improperly increased trade barriers on some farm 
products. But the group has generally held together very well 
indeed and been a highly effective alliance. 
  The new GATT, which member nations are expected to pass into 
domestic legislation before it takes effect from next January, 
will remove or lower trade tariffs and progressively free global 
trade in services, agriculture, textiles, and government 
procurement. Specific liberalization in some of these sectors 
has yet to be agreed, but for the first time they have been 
brought into the framework of rules, disciplines, and 
international disputes procedures. The next big step will be to 
resolve these outstanding points and negotiate the entry of the 
financial services and telecommunications sectors. Some rich 
nations are also pressing for uniform labor standards to be 
incorporated into these trading arrangements. That issue, which 
has understandably been condemned as protectionist by developing 
nations, should not proceed without careful study and debate. 
  Rather, the priority now should be to extend the GATT's 
inclusiveness by enrolling China. Beijing has been pressing for 
membership since 1986. Its application has rightly been 
supported by Australia and this week obtained conditional 
backing from the United States, the EU, Japan, and Canada. 
China stands to have the world's biggest economy by early next 
century. It is unthinkable it should continue to be isolated 
from the world economy. It would be a natural and auspicious 
beginning for the new world trade order to be inaugurated with 
the admission of what may become its biggest member.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] The Australian Government has made a major 
statement on employment and economic growth, calling for 
Australia to cut its jobless rate by half by the year 2000. The 
White Paper presented to Parliament by the prime minister, Paul 
Keating, says Australia can bring its unemployment rate down to 
five percent by the turn of the century. 
  To support the job strategy, Mr. Keating pledged to spend an 
extra Australian $6.5 billion over four years. From Canberra, 
Graeme Dobell reports: 
  [Begin Dobell recording] In its first White Paper on 
employment in nearly 50 years, the Australian Government says it 
will make sweeping changes to the social security system and 
what it calls landmarking labor market programs. 
  Much of the analysis is couched in the language of economic 
rationalism, arguing for jobs created by economic growth needing 
no government subsidies. It calls for continued low inflation, 
improved competitiveness, and productivity and further reforms 
of the Australian economy. But the White Paper says economic 
growth alone will not do enough for the long-term unemployed and 
truly disadvantaged. These are the 400,000 of Australia's one 
million unemployed who have been out of a job for more than 12 
months. 
  The response is what is to be known as the job compact -- a 
promise that anyone who has been drawing unemployment benefits 
for 18 months or more will be given a job. The government says 
it will provide training and support to give 6-12 months work, 
primarily in the private sector. The job compact promises some 
unemployed a training wage, so they can combine work with 
training. 
  The government says that by the financial year starting in 
the middle of next year, this employment and training promise 
will cost an extra Australian $2 billion. But this will be 
partly offset by savings of $800 million in unemployment 
benefits. The government will be budgeting in next financial 
year for extra $280 million to support the income of the 
unemployed and low wage earners, $160 million for industry and 
trade schemes, and $50 million to help develop remote Australian 
regions where jobless rates are the highest. 
  The trade policy repeats Australia's commitment to link into 
the dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific and enhance the 
multilateral trading system to be based on the World Trade 
Organization. The paper notes that by 1996, Australia's general 
tariff rate will be a maximum of five percent -- the end point 
of a tariff cutting regime starting in the late 1980's. 
  Recent Australian reports had suggested that tariff cuts 
could continue down to a maximum of three percent by the year 
2000, but the government has backed off from that idea. 
Instead, it has announced that the general five percent rate 
will continue beyond 1996. Canberra says this is one of the 
lowest maximum tariff rates in the world and thus developing 
country preferences will be phased out for all but the poorest 
countries. 
  In answer to many criticisms from Southeast Asia, Canberra 
has also pledged to amend its antidumping legislation, so it is 
closer to GATT standards. 
  In conclusion, the White Paper says that Australia has the 
chance to get the balance right to achieve a dynamic economy but 
also offer every Australian the right to a job. The government

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of an interview with Prime Minister Sitiveni </F>
Rabuka by senior writer Vasiti Waqa; place, date not given] 
  [Text] On Fiji being a leading nation in the 
region: 
  A lot of people think we are the leading nation in the 
Pacific. It has not been by design, it has been by the 
unalterable facts of geography, our own geography, our own 
position as being in the hub of the Pacific. We are in a 
position where we can play a vital role in these communication 
links. Therefore it will be in our interests to promote cordial 
relationships between our neighboring territories and our 
neighboring continents, so that they conduct their business 
amicably and we therefore benefit by the fact of our position. 
  On claims that Fiji's presence at regional gatherings has 
been Maybe we have just reassessed our participation. I 
believe our efforts are still the same, whether they may not be 
as high profile as they used to be. Probably there's 
personality differences. Whereas when Ratu Sir Kamisese (Mara) 
was there he was always the focus of attention. But now we are 
all there, more as equals. During his time, people sort of kept 
away from him. Now we gather and we find that we are able to 
conduct ourselves comfortably with each other. There is no 
generation gap, there is no cultural gap. 
  On what Fiji can do to boost trade with and between 
smaller island states: 
  At the Honiara Forum I mentioned that we were in a position 
to be able to help and right now we are in the process of 
finalizing a memorandum of understanding on fisheries and also 
on handicrafts with Tuvalu. I have also offered the Kiribati 
government a six to 12-month rent free accommodation if they 
wish to set up an embassy here. We had promised that we would 
help with the Kanak education fund. We are ready to help 
smaller Pacific Islands neighbors. We have done away with the 
visa fees for students, and those are the little things that we 
can do but they mean a lot. 
  On why Fiji is taking time to join the Melanesian 
Spearhead Group: 
  Because we do not want to join something that might break up 
the bigger community of the Pacific, particularly the Forum. 
They, the Melanesian group, might feel that they have common 
problems, Fiji might identify with some of those problems. But 
we also have problems that are felt by the Micronesian and the 
Polynesian people. So we feel that if there is nothing concrete 
that we can get out of it then we should not jump into it. Our 
manufacturers are saying it is now very difficult to go into the 
PNG [Papua New Guinea] market because they have special deals 
with the Melanesian Spearhead Groupings and different ones for 
us who are not in that group. Those are things that we will have 
to consider. 
  On whether Fiji is likely to pursue a "look north" 
policy similar to that of PNG: 
  I said that in 1987. Where else can we look? They (PNG) 
look north because north is where the market is, the sources 
are, and we will have to look that way also. We know that we 
have been looking west, towards Australia. And towards New 
Zealand. Our horizon is now getting broader and broader. The 
world is getting smaller. We have non-stop flights to Asia and 
it is only natural that we should also look north. 
  On frequent accusations that Fiji is trying to 
control the regional University of the South Pacific [USP]: 
  Our government contributes most financially to the USP. We 
also have the largest number of students. Perhaps it is because 
of that reality that the smaller island nations who do not have 
as many students there as we do, perhaps do not contribute as 
much as we do, feel that Fiji has got a heavy handed attitude 
towards the Pacific and that we want to control it. I wish we 
could control it. But we can't. We have tried to be sensitive 
to the perception of our regional neighbors and we have always 
conducted our business with the USP with the utmost discretion 
so that we do not offend or do not fan this flame of this 
perception that we feel that USP is a household item of the 
nation of Fiji. We want the University to continue to be a 
regional institution of higher learning and we want it to 
continue to contribute. 
  On relations with New Zealand: 
  New Zealand will never have the same understanding that we 
would like to have foreign governments have about our situation 
in Fiji. And it is wrong for us to expect them to have the same 
understanding because they belong to a different culture. For 
someone like Mr (Don) MacKinnon (New Zealand foreign minister) 
to get up and say what he said, he would have said it in good 
faith, he would have said it because that is what is acceptable 
in New Zealand to say, acceptable internationally to say, but 
for Fiji it is a very sensitive issue, that he does not see as a 
sensitive issue in Fiji, the way we see it. And that is why we 
had that minor exchange where we said: 'Well, don't try and 
come and tell us what to do when you can't even do what you're 
supposed to be doing to your own people.' And he will probably 
feel, 'Oh what do you know about what is happening here in New 
Zealand?' I feel that our relations, between Fiji and New 
Zealand, are so strong that differences in views like that will 
not affect them. 
  On inviting India to reopen its embassy in Fiji: 
  We must realize that there has not been any severance of 
diplomatic relations, just the closing down of the embassy and 
it was because of the personalities involved... (The) ambassador 
here, was conducting some activities that were seen to be 
outside the scope of his duties, as far as the international 
protocols are concerned, the conduct of diplomatic relations and 
duties, therefore he had to be asked to leave. They went a step 
further and closed down. 
  On renewing ties with the Commonwealth: 
  You will probably recall that in 1987, after the coup, the 
Bose Levu Vakaturaga (Great Council of Chiefs) passed a 
six-point resolution, one of them was the production of a new 
constitution, and among those other five was that attempts be 
made to reestablish our links with the Commonwealth. And this 
was brought out in his excellency's address (Ratu Sir Kamisese 
Mara's speech at the opening session of parliament). We were 
hoping that we might have some of our friends talking in our 
favor at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in 
Kuala Lumpur. Nothing really came out of that. Now we are 
looking to next year in New Zealand. Our expectations were 
knocked back a few steps by Don MacKinnon's statement, so I am 
not very optimistic that we are going to gain very much ground 
between now and 1995. It is not fair for us to expect these 
governments who have been talking about our constitution to 
suddenly say 'O.K, come in' while now we are in the process of 
reviewing our constitution. 
  On whether Fiji has been lobbying to get back into the 
Commonwealth: 
  We are not lobbying. I personally believe that we should 
leave it. By our very own actions sort out our own internal 
problems, show the international community, particularly the 
Commonwealth community that we are responsible enough to address 
our own problems which they perceive to be one that is against 
humanity and one that is against a race. Let us solve that and 
show to them that we are a responsible nation. 
  On the future of Fiji's peacekeeping troops in the 
Sinai and Lebanon: 
  The peacekeeping situation in Sinai and Lebanon we might be 
able to call an expenditure neutral activity because we are 
reimbursed the amount of money we spend to mount those two 
battalions. They are serving a very useful purpose, not only in 
keeping our young men occupied and employed but we are showing 
to the world that we are serious about the UN's attempt to 
maintain a peaceful globe. We will continue to do so as long as 
we are welcome and I think that the reputation that we have 
established and maintained is such a very high standard that we 
will continue to be welcome. 
  On whether the United States has done enough to start 
the Joint Commercial Commission: 
  Nothing has really happened since the last time we spoke 
about it, and these things take time perhaps. Because of the 
big machinery of the United States, it probably takes longer 
than for us smaller economies, smaller governments to get things 
going. No I cannot say that because it might be taken as 
criticizing the United States because they have not done enough. 
Maybe they are waiting for us in the Pacific to come out and 
say, look do it this way, we want it this way, rather than be 
seen as the big brother handing out sweets that you don't need. 
They have taken a step back and sort of waited for us to come 
forward and say this is the way we want it because this is the 
way it will work for us. 
  On his views on the movement for the freedom of Irian 
Jaya (West Papua) from Indonesia: 
  We have to be very careful about what we say about all these 
so-called indigenous movements within internationally recognized 
boundaries and borders. If we went ahead and said `OK, we 
sympathies with the people of Irian Jaya. We think they should 
be known as a separate state or they should join this state,' 
how would we deal with the question of the independence of 
Rotuma, as being espoused by Gibson, out there in Auckland 
somewhere? It is more than just indigenous groups struggling 
for their own recognition. They are a part of a nation. So it 
would be wrong for us to go and try and say to them we wish you 
well in what you are doing, because it would appear that we are 
treading into an area that we are not supposed to because we are 
interfering with the sovereign decision of a sovereign state. 
  What is Irian Jaya at the moment? It is part of Indonesia. 
It is not a colony of Indonesia, it is part of Indonesia, it is 
up to them, if they can get a voice heard in the committee of 24 
of the United Nations, the decolonization committee then perhaps 
that is the way for them to go. It would be wrong for us to 
unilaterally say anything about them, but if we were part of the 
committee of 24 decolonization committee then we could 
contribute that way. But it is up to them to try and get a 
hearing out there in the General Assembly or one of its 
committees. 
  [The following two answers appeared in separate boxes within 
the text of the item] 
  On Bougainville and the South Pacific Forum: 
  There have been lobby groups who have tried to bring the 
issue to be discussed on the agenda of the Forum. There has 
been some mention in the past but only casual mention because 
we, each of us, realize that the Bougainville issue is an 
internal problem that Papua New Guinea is trying very hard to 
resolve. Whenever we have this problem we will always get a lot 
of exaggeration, one way or the other, particularly on the 
suffering side. One picture could be reproduced so many times 
during the week and we could be looking at one picture, seven 
days a week, and you think that it is happening every day. I am 
not saying that there is no problem, no suffering, there is 
suffering, I believe. But it is something that I have been 
assured by the PNG officials that... that they are trying to do 
their best to resolve. 
  On protests about French nuclear tests: 
  Perhaps you have noticed that there has been no condemnation 
of nuclear testing because there has been no nuclear testing. 
It has been suspended and Fiji has been right up there with all 
those who are asking the French government not to resume testing 
of nuclear armaments and nuclear devices here in the Pacific, 
particularly on Mururoa and if there had been any perceived 
softening of opposition that is not the case. Our friendship 
with France is still there and when people conduct their 
international relationships, things like this do not normally 
affect them, particularly when it is between a big nation like 
France and a small like Fiji.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiti Waqa: "The Rabuka Saga"] </F>
  [Text] Sitiveni Rabuka's compact new month-old government 
vaulted its first hurdle. It was a shock challenge to the 
political security of the 45-year-old prime minister. It came 
to light at a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei [Fijian Political 
Party -- SVT] caucus meeting at which a handful of Rabuka's 31 
SVT members of parliament, who were dropped from his ministerial 
line-up, asked questions about his personal life. The issue was 
discussed at the party's second caucus on March 16, the day 
before all parliamentarians were sworn in. Issues raised could 
have deposed prime minister Rabuka if more members were stirred 
by them. But for the most part, they dismissed it as a bygone 
matter and for the sake of unity and party survival supported 
him. Rabuka's frankness and his admission, to parliamentarians 
and management board members, of an extramarital affair won him 
points for frankness and transparency. His clear offer to them 
to choose another leader if they no longer had any confidence in 
his leadership also gained him support. But despite repeated 
assurances of full party support, since the issue was made 
public, questions could still linger in some minds about his 
suitability as prime minister. The doubts could make his 
leadership role rather uncomfortable and perhaps contribute to 
government uncertainty. 
  Five former government ministers in his first government's 
cabinet were unhappy about Rabuka's personal life and questioned 
it. Two were formerly of cabinet rank, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola and 
Koresi Matatolu, and three state ministers -- Kiniviliame 
Taukeinikoro, Mesulame Narawa, and Joeli Kalou. They made their 
views known in a letter to Rabuka in which they withdrew their 
support from him as prime minister and asked him to resign 
immediately. They first criticized him for inviting the 
National Federation Party to join the SVT in a coalition 
government, without the "clear mandate or authority, let alone 
blessings" of the great council of chiefs and the general 
caucus. They also accused him of "committing adultery" in 
October last year, "with a woman journalist", on the chiefly 
island of Taveuni where his province of Cakaudrove was holding 
its provincial council meeting. 
<H5>  Personal Attack </H5>
  When asked if he would have accepted a party decision that 
he 
was unfit to lead because of his extramarital affair, Rabuka 
responded: "Yeah, right, exactly, and I had already warned out 
the president." On whether he had discussed the challenge with 
others in the caucus before the general discussion, Rabuka said: 
"No I didn't need to. It was a personal attack on me and I had 
to deal with it the way I thought was proper." Rabuka was asked 
about the issue being raised in the light of his party's 
relative success at the polls and generally positive response to 
his more streamlined 12-member cabinet. He said: "It was 
brought up in caucus, it was dealt with in caucus, and it was 
finished in caucus. I don't think there is any need to do any 
more than that. It was our own internal one, within caucus, and 
that has been resolved. Going back to the number of cabinet 
ministers, that is solely the prerogative of the prime minister 
and if people believe that they have been unfairly dumped or 
they have not been favorably considered then it's up to them. 
But if we were to change our prime minister, can there be a 
guarantee that they (axed ministers) will come in? You cannot 
satisfy everybody all the time people. You might be able to 
satisfy some people all the time, all the people some time but 
never everybody all the time." 
  He was also asked if he was satisfied that the issue had 
been 
resolved now: "I am satisfied that it is now behind us. If 
there are any who are still harboring those feelings I am sure 
it will come out and when it comes out, it comes out." On 
whether a prime minister's personal life, in this case an 
extramarital affair, was an issue for leadership, Rabuka said: 
"Within the party, within the group they might consider that 
and if it is something that we resolve in the party and the 
caucus feels, OK, you are no longer fit to be our leader, let's 
pick another one. So it's on that basis that I opened it up for 
discussion that day. And I asked those who tried to bring it up 
to say right, if you are defeated, will you come along and we 
all keep the party working together, because we owe it to the 
people to make this government work. And that was how it was 
resolved. So I don't know, these are personal things that 
people might want to bring up or question." 
<H5>  Public Property </H5>
  He later said: "I think people in high office like 
presidents and prime ministers should expect that. They are no 
longer their own, they are in fact really public property and 
people want to look at what you are, what you are like, what you 
eat, what you wear, so they (leaders) must expect that and if 
the nation feels you are not good enough, or if your party feels 
you're not good enough to lead, you face it." 
  The five who wrote to Rabuka were also members of a cabinet 
prayer group, along with Rabuka and others. Sources say they 
could also have been inspired by groups of people outside the 
parliamentary caucus who believed Rabuka should step down as 
prime minister. Concern also arose from the group's spiritual 
interest in Rabuka's life as an avowed Christian and Methodist 
lay preacher. He has reportedly stepped down from his position 
as lay preacher. Kubuabola, an official in the Baptist church, 
has been a close associate of Rabuka's and is reported to have 
confronted him about possibly compromising incidents in the past. 
<H5>  Letter </H5>
  Party sources say before it was raised in caucus Kubuabola 
met him to suggest he resign. Rabuka reportedly told him to 
bring the matter up at the party caucus but Rabuka himself took 
the initiative to raise the subject at the meeting and read out 
the group's letter. Sources say prior to the discussion, Rabuka 
may have suggested Kubuabola and others would get cabinet jobs 
in a planned expansion immediately before or after the 
announcement of the new budget, this month. A close Rabuka 
confidante and backbencher reportedly tried to play the part of 
a go-between -- attempting to placate Kubuabola and the other 
four on behalf of Rabuka. 
  Objections to the matter being raised by Kubuabola were 
heard 
from about a quarter of the parliamentarians and party 
management board officials before the party resolved to put the 
whole matter behind it. Sources say if there was any suggestion 
that Rabuka should step down because of the incident, these were 
brushed aside and his leadership and authority reconfirmed. 
Said one parliamentarian: "Rabuka was wise to bring it to 
caucus. This way he has cleared the air and once again gathered 
support." Some signatories to the letter withdrew after some 
discussion. Said Kalou: "The matter has been settled and I 
don't want to make any comment." One backbencher, who spoke on 
condition of not being identified, said: "I am glad the issue 
was discussed. It is good so that they (leaders) will know that 
we and the people are watching and they can behave." With the 
air cleared, government could get on with the business of 
running the country. It was a healthy sign for the party and 
they preferred the issue be discussed rather than having it 
swept under the carpet. They said open discussion meant an end 
to further grumbling and whispering in the back benches. There 
is some doubt as to whether Rabuka's judgment was altogether 
sound in taking the matter to caucus because he forced Kubuabola 
to discuss the issue in a forum where it was not altogether 
welcomed. By alienating Kubuabola in that manner, Rabuka has 
sacrificed a former political ally and right hand man. 
Kubuabola and Rabuka go back to the fiery nationalist marches 
leading up to the military coup of 1987 and the Taukei movement 
that was formed through it. 
<H5>  Public Discussion </H5>
  The issue is an interesting test case for Fiji, where more 
public discussion is being generated about the private lives of 
public figures. Being a relatively small and closely knit 
nation of 758,000, discussion about questionable actions of 
Fiji's public figures and leaders are inevitably confined to 
informal yaqona bowl discussions and the cocktail circuit. The 
caucus challenge and the reasons for it were alluded to by 
Fiji's two English dailies, the Fiji Times and Daily Post, and 
first disclosed in the local monthly magazine The Review. The 
impact of this unprecedented public airing will perhaps not be 
known for quite some time. It could be used by opposition 
Fijian parties for political mileage against Rabuka, and other 
Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa parliamentarians at political and Fijian 
communal gatherings. 
  If Rabuka had decided not to take the issue to the caucus he 
might have had a more difficult time dealing with Kubuabola and 
his group. Among the questions being asked now are: 
  -- will other ministers or Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei 
parliamentarians be questioned about their private lives? 
  -- would Rabuka have been confronted over the affair if he 
was a chief not a commoner? 
  -- and Can Rabuka now expect to be queried about every 
aspect 
of his personal life? 
  The issue of Rabuka's affair will hang over the prime 
ministership for quite some time. Even if it doesn't have any 
serious impact on his political position, it's the kind of 
headache party officials and supporters could well do without. 
  Although the government now has 31 seats, one more than last 
time, its coalition with four General Voters' Party members has 
been cut by one. That, plus the support of two independent 
parliamentarians, gives it back its previous total of 37 seats. 
This time though, observers say their position is weaker because 
the five Fijian opposition parliamentarians of the Fijian 
Association are strongly opposed to the government, unlike their 
predecessors. Former Fijian opposition members from the Fijian 
Nationalist United Front and Soqosoqo ni Taukei ni Vanua had 
some empathy for government policies and supported Rabuka. 
<H5>  Broken Ranks </H5>
  There are 37 seats for Fijians, 27 for Indians, five for 
Generals (islanders, part Europeans, and others) and one for 
Rotumans under the pro-Fijian 1990 constitution. The only 
Fijian non-SVT representatives elected were Fijian Association 
candidates from Lau in eastern Fiji and Naitasiri in central 
Viti Levu, Fiji's main island. Lau was seen to have broken 
ranks with the Great Council of Chiefs and its party, the SVT, 
by voting for the party which was endorsed by its provincial 
council and its own chief Ratu Finau Mara. He was previously 
the Lau member for the SVT, and it was primarily because of him 
that his party swept all three seats in his home province. 
  Former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Filipe 
Bole was defeated by 684 votes. His loss was a loss for the 
whole government side, especially in government and foreign 
affairs. Bole's expertise in the constitution review process was 
also going to be a loss for the Jai Ram Reddy-led National 
Federation Party and for the Indian opposition as a whole. On 
the government side, Bole is the best versed with the whole 
constitution review process. Indian leaders know him and have 
worked with him. So government has appointed him their special 
consultant on constitution review and will be involving him as 
closely as possible on this issue. 
  Naitasiri disproved the generalization that Fijians followed 
their chiefs to the polls. Steered by strong anti-government 
feelings, Naitasiri went against its more prominent chiefs, and 
backed lesser chiefs and a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei 
dissident, Ilai Kuli, to vote against the ruling party. Fijian 
Association party leader and former deputy prime minister in 
Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's interim government, Josevata 
Kamikamica, said support for the SVT came mainly from ties with 
the Great Council of Chiefs. "The election was also focussing 
on the leadership, on the style of leadership, and I think the 
results really show that the Fijian people prefer Rabuka and 
Rabuka's leadership." 
<H5>  Grooming </H5>
  Kamikamica said the Fijian Association "would like to groom, 
and help in the process of developing younger leaders. We have 
some very talented young chiefs, Ratu Finau (Mara), Ratu Apenisa 
(Cakobau, son of the late governor-general and high chief Ratu 
Sir George Cakobau), Ratu Edward (Tuivanuavou, a former army 
officer), and Ratu (Viliame) Dreunimisimisi (son of Fiji's late 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ratu Edward Cakobau 
and a former cabinet minister in Rabuka's 1992 government). 
  While theories have come and gone about different groups 
challenging Rabuka's leadership from within the party, Rabuka 
and party officials know they aren't out of the woods yet. 
Beyond the party circle and by Rabuka's own admission, cabinet 
is going to have to work hard to keep their enemies at bay. A 
piece of paper pledging loyalty and support for Rabuka, that all 
31 SVT parliamentarians signed the day after their victory was 
announced, isn't enough to bind them. Rabuka may have to hand 
out a few more cabinet appointments to those on the back bench 
who want them and find other ways and means of keeping his team 
happy. The theory that February election gave him an 
opportunity to clear out detractors and gather true blue 
supporters is now being tested.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Indonesia's Evil Occupation in New Guinea Can't </F>
Be Ignored"] 
  [Text] When, now and then, questions are asked about what 
Indonesia is doing in East Timor, it is time to think again 
about what Indonesia is really doing in the western part of New 
Guinea it calls Irian Jaya. In East Timor, a Portuguese 
territory it invaded, Indonesia admitted eventually and 
reluctantly that its troops slaughtered about a hundred students 
in the infamous Dili massacre. That was the last official 
figure. Now stories are emerging of how other people wounded by 
troops had their heads smashed in by soldiers, one by one, as 
they lay in their own blood in hospital, or were systematically 
poisoned. Still later reports, based on observations by western 
journalists who risked their lives to learn what is really 
happening in East Timor, suggest a scale of systematic murder of 
the population. If the reports are accurate, it spells 
genocide. If the scale of what the Indonesians are doing to the 
East Timorese people is debatable, it obviously is on a scale 
enough to mean death, torture, imprisonment, and terror for a 
great number of people who would rather not live under corrupt 
and dictatorial Indonesian rule. 
  And so to Western New Guinea. This is a former Dutch 
territory which, we shan't tire of reminding our readers, was 
handed shamefully to the Indonesians on a plate thanks to a sham 
United Nations vote pressured for by the Americans at a time 
when it was Washington's policy to do anything at all to curry 
favor with anti- Communist Asian regimes. 
  The Melanesian people of Western New Guinea were never 
allowed a scrap of "self determination"; their fate was 
determined for them. Ever since, they have been the victims of 
Indonesian colonialism. Many western New Guineas have been 
jailed, tortured, and killed for seeking independence for their 
country; many continued to be jailed, tortured, and killed. 
Various organizations and people critical of Indonesia quote 
various figures. These are suspect. But not suspect enough to 
deny the truth of reports that show the Indonesian regime in 
occupied western New Guinea to be oppressive. 
  In western New Guinea, the Indonesians are simply probably 
doing a better job hiding their crimes there than they are in 
East Timor. Recently, to their credit, the Americans have taken 
note of what is happening in East Timor and are now limiting the 
supplies of arms to the Indonesians. Not so the British, who 
after being so indignant about the Falkland Islands, Kuwait, and 
Bosnia have no qualms about selling jet warplanes to the 
Indonesians, as they are happily doing so now. 
  The Indonesians regularly invade Papua New Guinea to kill 
indigenous rebels who cross the border from the occupied western 
half of the island. There is some evidence, which the Papua New 
Guinea government appears to want to ignore, that Indonesian 
troops recently killed a dozen or more Papua New Guinea 
villagers. 
  Some of Indonesia's neighbors, and countries like Britain 
who 
want to sell it arms, make a great effort to whitewash the 
Indonesians. Indonesia is a huge market of 200 million. This 
is what attracts the British, Americans, French, the 
Australians, and other exporting countries. It is a militarily 
powerful, dictatorial, corrupt, aggressive, and expansionist 
country, which is what frightens Australia and Papua New Guinea. 
Indeed Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, at the time hot 
on Kuwait too, described Indonesia as "no country is more 
important to Australia". He heads a government with a policy 
which wreaks of appeasement where the Indonesians are concerned. 
  Alas, there is very little that can be done about Indonesia 
except to treat it with caution. It is too big and dangerous to 
do otherwise. One small bloom in the desert is that some 
Indonesians acknowledge their sins and that the seeds of 
democracy and decency in their country are beginning to sprout. 
Unfortunately, the growth rate of these delicate plants is 
unlikely to be fast enough to be of any help to the East 
Timorese or the west New Guineans. They are doomed to be 
devoured by Indonesia. Australia, and Papua New Guinea's mental 
agony is: could we one day be gobbled up too?

  [Text] The armed forces of Singapore and the Philippines 
will carry out regular joint military exercises and training. 
  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) formalising the training 
arrangement, as well as co-operation between the two sides, was 
signed between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the 
Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] on Thursday. 
  The signing of the MOU took place at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs Building in Manila between Mr. Roberto R.Romulo, 
the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Tan Seng 
Chye, Singapore's Ambassador to the country. 
  Anoa-Singa 2/94 will be the first exercise which will be 
held 
following this newly signed agreement. 
  It will be conducted here from May 12-18. 
  Under the Anoa-Singa series, regular joint land exercises 
will be held between the two armed forces, with the venue 
alternating between the countries. 
  The first exercise under this series took place last year in 
the Philippines. 
  Thursday's MOU is, however, not the SAF's first training 
agreement with the AFP. 
  Under an earlier one concluded in 1979, the Republic of 
Singapore Air Force [RSAF] was allowed to deploy regular 
training detachments at the Clark Air Base. 
  The RSAF ceased this deployment only when the eruption of 
Mount Pinatubo in 1990 made the air base inoperable. 
  The air force agreement expired subsequently, in December 
1991. 
  The Ministry of Defence said that the signing of the new MOU 
affirmed the friendly relations existing between the two 
countries and their long-term commitment to closer defence ties 
and co-operation between the SAF and the AFP.

  [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] and other 
militant groups are asking for the immediate release of arrested 
rebel leader Wilma Tiamzon and a 300 other political detainees. 
The request was made by NDF Vice Chairperson Luis Jalandoni and 
the hierarchy of the League of Filipino Students. 
  The group said that Tiamzon's rights and and those of her 
comrades should be respected so that the peace process being 
pushed by the Ramos Government can be successful. 
  According to NDF, Tiamzon should be freed since no charges 
have yet been filed against her in court.

<F P=106> [By Margarita H. Debuque] </F>
  [Text] The country's export earnings for the first quarter 
this year rose by 17.8 percent to $2.92 billion -- a 
$440-million uptick from $2.48 billion in the same period last 
year. 
  Dollar earnings for March alone amounted to $1.05 billion, 
or 
up 24.6 percent from its year ago value of $842.46 million. 
Month on month, March export receipts exceeded February 
earnings by a hefty $132 million. 
  The National Statistics Office said this is only the fifth 
time export earnings for a single month hurdled the 
billion-dollar mark. The other four times were in September to 
December last year. 
  As before, electronics and components (composed of 
micro-circuits and semiconductors) continued to get the lion's 
share of exports. Dollar earnings in the sector, registering at 
$302.04 million, accounted for 28.8 percent of total March 
exports. This followed a whopping 49 percent annual growth. 
  Garments and accessories came in second with receipts valued 
at $161.44 million. Though earnings dipped slightly by 0.4 
percent from the previous month, the sector still absorbed a 
chunk of export receipts -- about 15.4 percent of total March 
export earnings. 
  Meanwhile, ignition wiring set and other wiring sets used in 
vehicles, aircraft and ships ranked third after netting earnings 
of $32.14 million. This is 36.2 percent higher than the 
previous year's value of $23.6 million, but 5.6 percent lower 
than $34.06 million in February. 
  Riding the wave of economic recovery in foreign markets, 
dollar earnings from exports of woodcrafts and furniture 
registered at $29.35 million a 15.9 percent jump from last year 
is $25.33 million. 
  Similarly, demand for frozen and chilled shrimps and prawns 
leaped by 66.6 percent to $28.33 million. This was tailed 
closely by cathodes and sections of cathodes of refined copper 
and gold with receipts ringing up $27.34 million and $22.35 
million respectively. Gold in particular, more than doubled its 
earnings as it posted the highest growth rate of 129 percent. A 
decline in demand, however, was posted by the coconut oil 
industry because of competition from other vegetable oils and 
stunted local production. 
  To show for this, export earnings from coconut oil, though 
in 
the eighth slot, fell by 13.1 percent to its March value of 
$20.89 million. 
  Other top dollar earners of the country were fresh bananas 
($20 million) and footwear ($18 million). 
  The ten principal exports altogether recorded earnings worth 
$661.88 million accounting for 63 percent of total March 1994 
exports. 
<H5>  Top Markets </H5>
  In the first quarter of the year, the Philippine's trade 
with 
the ten major foreign markets registered at $2.41 billion. This 
is 18 percent higher than $2.04 billion posted in the comparable 
period last year. 
  For March alone, dollar receipts from the ten top markets 
amounted to $871.88 million or 83 percent of total export value. 
  The United States remained the top importer of Philippine 
products with export earnings from that country reaching $360.55 
million. U.S. consumers gobbled up 34.3 percent of total 
exports. 
  Demand for Philippine products there rose 18.5 percent from 
last year's level as consumers crawled out of a recession. 
  Local products that did well in the U.S. market include 
garments, electronics and ignition wiring sets. 
  Japan ranked second, with Philippine imports worth $176.69 
million or 16.8 percent of the country's total export receipts 
in March. 
  Third was Hong Kong, with export purchases reaching $55.11 
million, followed closely by U.K. with imports worth $51.02 
million. 
  Gains from the major export markets in March added up to 
$228.52 million or 21.8 percent of total export earnings. 
  Other markets were Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, the 
Netherlands, Thailand and Korea.

<F P=106> [By Emily R. Pena] </F>
  [Text] The Department of Interior and Local Government 
(DILG) announced yesterday the implementation of infrastructure 
projects, worth P [Philippine peso] 21.621 million, in five 
provinces in the Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR). 
  In a report submitted by the Department of Public Works and 
Highways (DPWH) to the DILG, it was noted that the multi-million 
project enrolled by DPWH under the Kabuhayan [Livelihood] 2000 
program of President Ramos is designed to increase agricultural 
productivity in the region. 
  Among those provinces which will benefit from the project 
are 
Abra, Kalinga-Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao and Mt. Province. 
  Engineer Jose C. Guanzon, DPWH project manager, said the 
improvement of roads and water supply construction projects 
using labor-based/equipment-supported (LB/ES) methods will 
accelerate development in CAR areas specifically, in terms of 
generating more employment among the people here. 
  In Abra, the Pigidian-Abra-Ilocos Sur road is being 
concreted 
while water supply structure will be constructed in 
Villaviciosa, Laplapog, and in Lagayan, Pang-ot and in other 
selected municipalities in Benguet. 
  Improvement of drainage and road concreting will also be 
undertaken in Bokod, Benguet-Viscaya road, and in Mankayan, 
Abatan, and Mankayan-Cervantes in Benguet. 
  Meanwhile, the DPWH has also identified municipalities in 
Kalinga-Apayao, Ifugao and Mt. Province that will be included in 
its infrastructure program under Kabuhayan 2000. 
  DILG heads the steering committee of Kabuhayan 2000, a 
program of the government which aims to generate more job 
employment and opportunities in the countryside within three 
years.

<F P=106> ["Spotlight" report by Jean de Toulkork: "Shake-up stirs </F>
bitterness in FUNCINPEC"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Morale is low in the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] party of First Prime Minister Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh following a high-level shake-up involving 
Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut. 
  According to a senior Cambodian Minister, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, Ranariddh has fired Sirivut from the 
post of FUNCINPEC secretary-general and given him the less 
influential post of vice president to the party. 
  Loy Simchheang, the third vice president of the National 
Assembly, has been appointed to replace Sirivut as party 
secretary general. 
  Ranariddh, the minister said, has been unhappy with 
Sirivut's 
siding with Finance Minister Sam Rangsi who has taken a strong 
stand against the activities in Cambodia of the Thai Bun Rong 
company. 
  Sirivut, who is King Norodom Sihanouk's stepbrother, has 
been 
a keen supporter of Rangsi's economic polices and financial 
management of Cambodia's troubled economy. Both Rangsi and 
Sirivut have received the blessing of King Sihanouk in their 
endeavours and in recent weeks the two ministers have met often 
at Sirivut's office in the foreign ministry. 
  On April 16, while celebrations of the Cambodian New Year 
were in full swing, Ranariddh summoned Sirivut to his home and 
told him that he was no longer the secretary general of the 
party, a post to which he had been appointed only early in the 
year. 
  Ranariddh's move angered Sirivut who expected better 
treatment from the first prime minister. The following day, 
Sirivut was conspicuously absent from a ceremony at the Royal 
Palace during which ministers paid their respects to the king 
and queen on the occasion of Chol Chhnam Thmei (traditional 
Cambodian New Year). 
  Sirivut, the minister said, was considering his position in 
the government as he had been shocked by Ranariddh's unilateral 
action, which was not submitted to the consideration of the 
higher ranks of the party. 
  Sirivut has been a loyal lieutenant of Ranariddh's, even 
siding with him against the notorious Prince Norodom 
Chakkrapong, Ranariddh's step-brother and fierce opponent. Now 
Sirivut feels that his loyalty and support for Ranariddh has not 
been reciprocated by the first prime minister. 
  In January this year, when Ranariddh was under strong 
pressure from the Cambodian People's Party to fire the finance 
minister, it was Sirivut's threat to resign as deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister which saved Rangsi. 
  Sirivut and Rangsi have strong views about relations with 
Thailand and about the need to clean up the business environment 
established by Thai merchants in Phnom Penh. In their view, 
they have received strong support from colleagues in FUNCINPEC 
and the population of Cambodia, especially from those small 
traders affected by the long-running conflict with the Thai Bun 
Rong company over the Olympic market affair. 
  King Sihanouk, who strongly supports the foreign affairs and 
finance policies of the two ministers, has gone out of his way 
to make public his blessing. 
  In January, when Rangsi was in danger of being dismissed, 
the 
King wrote a letter congratulating him and his staff for their 
good work. In the same month, he elevated Sirivut to the rank 
of Sdech Kromkhun, making him among the most senior princes of 
the Royal Cambodian Family. 
  Significantly, under the same Kret (Royal Decree), the King 
elevated to the same rank two of his sons -- Prince Norodom 
Sihakmoni, and Prince Norodom Chakkrapong. Both of these would 
side with Sirivut against Ranariddh in any confrontation among 
Royal Family members, observers say. 
  Royal Palace sources declined to reveal the King's reaction 
to the removal of Sirivut from the influential party post. But 
one source said the king was "deeply concerned" by some recent 
actions.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea [NADK] spokesman on 5 May; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] I. On 4 May, the French press agency AFP urgently 
circulated a misleading report saying that the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] had raped scores of women and then 
killed them. The NADK spokesman categorically rejects the 
French press agency's disgusting and base propaganda, which 
arises from nasty and dark political motives. 
  II. The NADK's morality and virtue is far different -- as 
different as sky and earth -- from that of the communist 
Vietnamese lackeys and their alliance, with the United States, 
France, and Australia acting as proxies. The Cambodian nation 
and people are well aware that it is the communist Vietnamese 
puppets and the U.S., French, and Australian lackey puppets who 
are the bandits and criminals and who have shot and beheaded 
people without mercy. They have also raped and executed women, 
elderly people, children, pregnant women, and women who are 
giving birth to their babies in accordance with the fascist and 
barbarous nature of their masters. 
  As for the NADK, they are the people's children; they have 
arduously struggled and shared weal and woe with the nation and 
people to defend their localities and prevent the enemies of the 
nation and people from acting at will. The NADK has never done 
the disgusting, base, and barbarous things that are being 
slanderously alleged in this propaganda. 
  Look, why do the Cambodian nation and people support 
Democratic Kampuchea? Why do the Cambodian nation and people 
oppose the communist Vietnamese and U.S. puppets and their 
masters? 
  III. It may be asked: What is behind the slanderous reports 
carried by the propaganda machines of France and the alliance? 
They have painstakingly acted in this way for the following 
reasons: 
  A. They are attempting to slander and discredit the NADK, 
which is vigorously supported and assisted by the Cambodian 
nation and people in both the northern and western parts of 
Cambodia -- presently the scene of fighting against invading 
forces from the two-headed Phnom Penh government and abroad. In 
view of this situation, the communist Vietnamese and their 
alliance are extremely anxious. They have been anxiously 
running around. They have ordered their lackeys to kneel at the 
feet of the communist Vietnamese and ask them to send troops to 
keep the puppets from collapsing entirely. Along with this, 
they have intensified their political and diplomatic maneuvers 
and stepped up these accusations, which are part of their 
propaganda and psychological warfare. 
  B. They have strived to commit this slander with the aim of 
further denigrating us and instigating conflicts within 
Cambodia's national community. This will enable them to 
intervene without difficulty and further stir up and inflame the 
war of aggression, thereby allowing them to come in and secure 
their respective vested interests. 
  This is what they call respect for human rights and the 
people's right to self-determination. They are the criminals 
and warmongers, (?joining) the communist Vietnamese to do away 
with the Cambodian nation and race. Yet they have hurled 
accusations against the NADK, which has arduously struggled to 
protect the people and nation and prevent the criminals from 
acting at will. 
  This is clear evidence that the alliance -- with the United 
States, France, and Australia as proxies -- does not want 
Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, national 
compromise, and peace. They have actively launched their 
propaganda and sought all available military, political, 
diplomatic, propaganda, and psychological means to inflame the 
war further and destroy Democratic Kampuchea at all costs. 
  IV. Nevertheless, concrete experiences since August 1993 
have clearly demonstrated and brought into broad daylight that 
even though the communist Vietnamese puppets and the American 
and French puppets have been combined; even though millions of 
dollars have been spent to buy guns, tanks, and so on from the 
communist Vietnamese and Russia; and even though they have 
strived to provide assistance in the technical field and in 
psychological warfare, they can never prevail over the nation, 
people, and NADK. We have joined forces to carry out the 
struggle to crush the invasion by the communist Vietnamese and 
their puppets and the alliance and its lackey puppets, causing 
them to scatter and suffer a shameful defeat. 
  They are currently being forced by the nation and people as 
well as the king to terminate their war and accept his majesty's 
five-point policy to achieve genuine national reconciliation and 
unity, thereby allowing Cambodia to restore peace and survive. 
  [Signed] The NADK spokesman 
  [Dated] 5 May 1994
