  [Text] Nago -- The existence of a U.S. Forces nuclear and 
chemical arms unit, which is stationed at the Henoko Ammunition 
Storage [HAS] in Nago, has again become a controversy in 
connection with the issue of a secret agreement on the 
deployment of nuclear arms in Okinawa concluded before Okinawa's 
reversion to Japanese administration. 
  Japan Communist Party [JCP] member Keijin Oshiro (Nago City 
Assembly member) demanded on 11 May: "The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs [MOFA] acknowledged during Diet deliberations in 1981 
that a U.S. Forces unit specializing in poison gas and nuclear 
arms is stationed at HAS. However, the U.S. Forces have so far 
not answered questions on the existence or withdrawal of this 
unit. Now is the time to thoroughly investigate this 
allegation." 
  At a session of the House of Councilors Committee on Foreign 
Affairs on 8 September 1981, MOFA acknowledged the deployment of 
a maintenance unit specializing in special weapons, including 
nuclear arms, at HAS. 
  This unit is called Detachment I (DET I) of the Third Marine 
Amphibious Force headquartered at Camp Courtney. The then MOFA 
Counselor Matsuda said at the Diet session: "DET I is capable 
of maintaining chemical and nuclear weapons. However, it does 
not mean that DET I possesses nuclear arms." 
  Oshiro pointed out: "So far, the U.S. Forces have not 
answered questions concerning the withdrawal of DET I at all. 
The secret agreement issue has further deepened suspicions."

<F P=106> [Statement by Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota on reports that </F>
Japan and the United States signed a secret agreement on 
deployment of nuclear weapons in 1969] 
  [Text] Twenty-five years have passed since the Japan-U.S. 
joint communique was issued. Recently, however, it was reported 
that a bilateral secret accord exists. This report resulted in 
great shock and further anxieties among Okinawan residents, who 
eagerly hope for the removal of U.S. military bases. The 
Okinawa Prefectural Government considers this a serious matter. 
It will ask the central government to take steps acceptable to 
the Okinawan people to disclose the facts, and state its views 
on the three anti- nuclear principles. From the standpoint of 
protecting local residents' lives, livelihood, and properties, 
we will further seek a peaceful Okinawa with no "nuclear arms" 
and "military bases" by patiently appealing to both the Japanese 
and U.S. Governments to make efforts.

  [Text] The government plans to revise for the first time 
in almost 30 years the method of computing statistics, adopted 
in fiscal 1966, on balance of international payments. This is 
in response to the situation in which trade in services, such as 
finance, communications, and transport, has become active with 
the advance of internationalization, and the pace of trade 
expansion in this area is expected to exceed that in merchandise 
trade. With the aim of increasing transparency of services 
trade, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) formulated new 
standards last autumn and asked member nations to revise the 
method of computing their statistics on international balance of 
payments in accord with the standards. Taking the same steps as 
the United States and Europe, Japan also plans to revise its 
statistics. The government will begin the revision based on a 
report to be compiled in June by the Council on Foreign Exchange 
and Other Transactions (an advisory panel to the finance 
minister and the international trade and industry minister). New 
statistics are expected to be adopted in two or three years. 
  International balance of payments includes current balance, 
which shows data on trade in goods, such as automobiles and home 
electric appliances, and on trade in services. Presently, 
current balance consists of balance of trade, balance of 
invisible trade, and balance of transfer. The planned revision 
will center on improving data on services trade, which is a 
category in invisible trade balance. The government is to 
classify data on services trade into about 10 groups by adding 
communications, construction, information, and other items to 
the present transport and travel. This broad classification 
will enable one to know the actual state of services trade at a 
glance. 
  Japan is a nation with a huge trade surplus. It registered a 
surplus of $141.4 billion in its balance of trade in 1993. On 
the other hand, the nation's balance of invisible trade in the 
same year was a deficit of $3.8 billion, reflecting the 
increasing number of Japanese who make trips abroad. A 
government source said by disclosing detailed data on services 
trade, "Japan can demonstrate that its markets are open." 
However, if Japan discloses data on balance of payments in the 
construction market, which is not fully open to foreign 
competition, the United States and Europe might increase their 
pressure on Japan to open it wider. 
  Currently, "capital account balance" is divided into 
long-term capital balance (which shows data on increase and 
decrease of external assets and debts during a period of over 
one year) and short-term capital balance (which shows data 
during a period of less than one year). The government plans to 
abolish this classification because it is difficult to know from 
the data what private companies are aiming at. Instead, it will 
reclassify the capital account balance into "direct foreign 
investment," "portfolio investment," and "other investments." 
Direct foreign investment is an act to acquire shares in 
foreign companies to participate in management, while portfolio 
investment is an act to purchase foreign government bonds. 
  Free trade in services was seriously discussed in the 
Uruguay 
Round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations. The final act of 
the round signed in Marrakech, Morocco, in April notes that 
trade barriers should be lowered by extending the scope of 
liberalization from merchandise trade to services trade.

  [Text] A draft amendment to the Insurance Business Law, 
the preparations of which the Finance Ministry has made as part 
of deregulatory steps for the financial industry, came to light 
on 9 May. The draft amendment allows insurance companies to do 
life and damage insurance business through their subsidiaries, 
and calls for creating an insurance brokerage system that the 
United Sates has strongly demanded. The draft amendment also 
stipulates the establishment of a fund assistance corporation to 
financially rescue insurance companies in trouble. These new 
measures will spur competition among life and casualty insurance 
companies, and precipitate deregulation in the life and casualty 
insurance industry which lags behind the banking and securities 
industries. The measures will also broaden the choices of 
consumers. 
  The draft amendment will be incorporated in a final report 
to 
be compiled in the near future by the legal system panel under 
the Insurance Council (an advisory body to the finance minister). 
  The Finance Ministry will flesh out the draft amendment 
after 
the council approves it. The ministry plans to submit an 
amendment bill to the Diet during its ordinary session next year 
and put the amended Insurance Business Law in force in 1996. 
The current Insurance Business Law that was enacted in 1939 
will be amended after half a century of enforcement. 
  The draft amendment allows insurance companies, banks, and 
securities companies to participate in the life and casualty 
insurance business through their subsidiaries.

  [Text] There is persistent speculation in foreign exchange 
markets that the yen will further appreciate. This is because 
many think it is difficult for the Japanese Government to 
realize its plan, launched at a meeting of economic ministers 
over the weekend, to reduce Japan's current accounts surplus as 
a measure to bring down the value of the yen. Behind this 
speculation also lies the fact that dollar-selling pressure 
continues in foreign exchange markets due to apprehensions about 
a possible drop in U.S. bonds, stock prices, and the value of 
the dollar (a triple drop). Although Japanese and U.S. monetary 
authorities are prepared to cooperate in halting any further 
appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar, some 
people point out that the United States is reluctant to reduce 
the yen's value. Thus, there is growing speculation that the 
yen will continue to strengthen. 
  On 2 May, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] intervened off and on in 
the Tokyo foreign exchange market through dollar-buying and 
yen-selling, but the exchange rate remained on the level of 101 
yen to the dollar. The fact that the yen dipped only to the 
101-yen level (closing rate) despite last week's dollar-buying 
and yen-selling intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve 
indicates the strength of the markets' yen-buying pressure. 
  Behind the recent surge of the yen lies Japan's huge current 
account surplus totaling about $130 billion. While some 
Japanese companies are boosting their exports to the United 
States, a drastic increase in Japan's imports is unlikely due to 
the flagging economy. 
  To reduce the current account surplus, it is imperative for 
Japan to promote deregulation and increase imports by 
implementing economy-boosting measures. However, many dealers 
think "it is difficult for the minority Hata government to 
launch a full-scale pump-priming package, including tax 
reduction measures," (according to the Long-Term Credit Bank). 
  The BOJ notes: "Since the government has said it will take 
steps to cut the current accounts surplus, we expect it to work 
out effective measures." But at the same time, it admits that 
if Japan fails to meet U.S. expectations, "this will disappoint 
Washington and incur the risk of further appreciation of the 
yen." 
  Another cause of the recent surge in the yen is that many 
investors are moving their funds from the dollar. Because of 
persistent speculation that Washington will tighten its monetary 
policy, government bonds and stock prices have shown a falling 
tendency in the United States. Investors who hate this tendency 
are moving to shift their funds from the dollar to the yen and 
the mark. In actuality, the mark closed at 1.6549 against the 
dollar on the Tokyo foreign exchange market on 2 May, marking 
the first rise in its value in six and a half months. The 
dollar is depreciating against the yen and European currencies 
and this caused the recent sharp surge in the yen. 
  For the time being, monetary authorities' intervention in 
foreign exchange markets will be the only measure to deal with 
the markets' yen-buying pressure. However, many people point 
out that this measure has only a limited effect. The value of 
the yen rose last year due to pressure from the U.S. Government 
in foreign exchange markets. This year, Japan's current accounts 
surplus and investors' distrust of the dollar are behind the 
recent surge in the yen, and Washington is now refraining from 
applying direct pressure for the yen's appreciation. 
Intervention in foreign exchange markets may help prevent the 
yen from further appreciating, but it will not be able to remove 
the causes of the yen's surge. 
  Although the BOJ intervened in the market on 2 May, it did 
not indicate a determined attitude toward efforts to depreciate 
the yen. Thus, some people have doubts about Japan's efforts to 
prevent the yen from further appreciating in cooperation with 
the United States. 
  Nonetheless, the government and the BOJ are worried that, if 
the exchange rate breaches the 100-yen-to-the-dollar level, 
private companies will immediately lose their business 
confidence. The BOJ will ask central banks in the United States 
and Europe to cooperate in preventing the yen from further 
appreciating.

  [Text] In preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit talks and 
the major industrialized nations' summit talks (Naples summit) 
in July, the new administration led by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will be fully engaged in working out tax system reform 
bills to be proposed by the government and ruling coalition 
parties after the Golden Week [29 April to 5 May] holidays. 
Bills related to tax reform are originally planned to be 
approved at an extraordinary Diet session in fall. However, 
prospects of approval remain uncertain due to the secession of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the 
administration. Moreover, there is a possibility of Diet 
dissolution to be followed by a general election. Under such a 
political situation, there is increasing concern over the 
possibility that "the official pledge given to Japanese citizens 
and foreign countries may not be fulfilled." On the other hand, 
some members of the ruling coalition parties hold the view that 
the situation might develop into a realignment involving part of 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the right wing of the 
SDPJ, saying: "Depending on how tax system reform is handled, 
this may trigger the realignment of political parties." 
  The Hata administration gives top priority to raising the 
consumption tax rate in tax reform. Taking possible opposition 
by the SDPJ and the public into consideration, the expression 
"rise in indirect tax" was used in the policy agreement reached 
before the inauguration of the coalition administration. 
However, most ruling party members now say that "The agreement 
should have clearly stated 'consumption tax hike.' There is no 
possibility of and time for working out a completely new tax. 
There is no other choice but to correct the defects of the 
present tax system and raise the consumption tax," (according to 
a participant of the ruling parties' representatives' meeting). 
  The ruling parties' tax system reform council has to 
urgently 
reorganize its affairs because members from the SDPJ, such as 
Council Chairman Koken Nosaka, have left the ruling coalition. 
However, it is also true that some ruling party members express 
the optimistic view that "it becomes easier to reach a consensus 
because there is no factor of uncertainty" after the secession 
of the SDPJ opposed to the consumption tax hike, (as stated by a 
senior Shinseito official). 
  However, even if the reform bills are worked out, the 
following possibilities still exist: 1) The Hata cabinet will 
be forced to resign en masse or dissolve the House of 
Representatives to hold a general election if a motion of no 
confidence against the cabinet is submitted after passing the 
1994 budget bill; and 2) tax reform bills may not be approved by 
the Diet because of the opposition of the LDP and the SDPJ, even 
if Hata cabinet remains in the office. 
  Some SDPJ members, who won public support in the last 
election by advocating "opposition to consumption tax," will run 
in the election for the House of Councilors next summer. While 
SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama says that "there is no other 
choice but to share the tax burden through indirect tax," the 
party urges a radical revision of the consumption tax that will 
result in its virtual abolition. Most LDP members also adopt a 
cautious stance that "a tax hike should not be implemented 
thoughtlessly."

<F P=106> [Article by Naoko Iwasaki, economic reporter: "Themes of </F>
Budget Compilation"] 
<H5>  [9 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>
  [Text] Need Bold Rethinking of Allocations; More 
Clear-Cut Reflection of Policy 
  The fiscal 1994 draft budget has been submitted to the 
Diet and deliberations on it have started. The coalition parties 
have hyped it as "a challenge to create a new policymaking 
system" (Policy Deliberation Council Chairman Nobuyuki Sekiyama, 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]); but the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] criticizes it as "having merely 
strengthened bureaucratic leadership." Here we will try looking 
into the topic of how the budget is created on behalf of the 
public. 
<H5>  Solidarity Within Ruling Parties </H5>
  In the LDP era, each subsection of the Policy Affairs 
Research Council had solidarity with each ministry and agency. 
They listened to the wishes of business circles and sometimes 
put pressure on the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. The coalition 
parties hold that such an arrangement lent power to "zoku 
[special-interest] Diet members" and are focusing power in 
policy planning board. Specifically, they created budget 
working groups with a member from each of the five party 
factions and built a new system for also drawing out the views 
of each ministry and agency. 
  Yet, at the same time, taking a cue from the LDP, each of 
the 
ruling parties has also tried expanding such subcommittees as 
their agricultural and forestry subcommittees. As the linkages 
between policy planning board and these subcommittees were not 
made clear, complaints were heard from ministries, agencies and 
business circles such as that "right to the end, we did not 
understand well" where the shortcuts were for closely linking up 
to have our wishes heard or to collect data. 
  The confusion might have weakened the collusion of 
"politicians-bureaucrats-business sectors" some, but the 
mechanism for putting together the appeals and wishes of 
pressure groups that are one expression of the popular will also 
has weakened. In short, budget allocations are almost entirely 
entrusted to adjustments between the MOF and the ministries and 
agencies making requests. 
  To block the creation of zoku Diet members, other ways can 
be 
devised such as preventing Diet members staying in one field 
many years. In the future, in order to form solidarity within 
the coalition government, the government should establish a 
system that Diet members study at each party's subcommittees, 
and based on that information, the coalition government reflect 
its ideas in the budget at the policy planning board. 
<H5>  Fences of Ministries and Agencies </H5>
  In the fiscal 1994 draft budget they have somewhat altered 
the allocation ratios for public works, cut back on slim 
subsidies and to some degree promoted the transfer of subsidized 
projects to the provinces. Such changes are in line with trends 
from the era of LDP regimes and may be said to have been 
somewhat expanded in the adjustments between the MOF and the 
ministries and agencies making requests. 
  Nevertheless, what is called for hereafter are such bold 
policy changes as terminating ongoing projects and advancing the 
fusing and abolition of bureaucratic structures. As it is quite 
impossible to push this forward through coordination among the 
ministries and agencies, it will become the turn for politics. 
  In the budget draft, insurance rates for things like welfare 
pensions are set to be raised; however, there was little debate 
from the standpoint of the public burden matching that to taxes. 
If, for example, meshing with tax increases and cuts, the higher 
tax receipts are shunted into the national treasury's 
obligations for pensions, increases in insurance rates could be 
reduced. It is a political task to go beyond frameworks such as 
pensions in the Ministry of Health and Welfare and taxes in the 
FOM and to consider the overall burden on the public. 
  With allocations for public works, too, is there something 
inevitable about having such beach maintenance projects as 
shore-protection work divided up at almost the same allocation 
rate among the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry, and the Ministry of Transport? Political 
judgments are a necessity also in rethinking budget allocations 
transcending ministries and agencies. 
<H5>  Ceilings </H5>
  Estimated request standards (ceilings) set in about July in 
normal years (August in the case of the fiscal 1994 budget) are 
what fix the framework for raising or cutting each ministry's or 
agency's prior year budget rates. Setting upper limits on 
budgets for the sake of fiscal rebuilding has served to give a 
priority ordering to policies for the bureaucracy, but also has 
had the bad effect of bolstering the sense of each ministry and 
agency being on a par. Also, because of emphasis on early timing 
rather than on the compilation itself, this becomes a cause for 
budgets being unable to respond to change in economic conditions. 
  In contrast to this time, in facing the fiscal 1995 budget 
compilation, the coalition regime has time to consider the needs 
of this system. If these are to be kept as goals for the rough 
estimate requests of each ministry and agency, it is conceivable 
that--with some easing up--they will make judgments on degrees 
of priority and business climate trends and will even do much 
trimming. 
  For fiscal 1994, one day before the MOF's draft, the Fiscal 
System Council (finance minister's consultative body) reported 
its "rationalization policy for cutting outlays"; and the day 
the draft came out, the cabinet decided on a course for budget 
compilation. Such indicators, however, turned out to have come 
along too late and were severely gutted. Such plans should be 
accelerated and made to reflect actual compilation operations. 
<H5>  [10 Mar 94 p 4] </H5>
  [Text] More Effort To Supply Data; Boldly Rethink 
Plans Also 
  Wiping the slate clean on the "national welfare tax" 
concept which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had announced was 
partly a result of the fact that data had not been adequately 
provided on welfare and the burdens of an aging society. This is 
a classic example, and even while the socioeconomic situation 
surrounding finance and budgeting is becoming ever more complex, 
the bureaucracies, starting with the fiscal authorities, have 
been slow to show their intention. 
<H5>  Intermediate Processes </H5>
  As one focus of the fiscal 1994 draft budget, one can 
mention 
that growth in the initial sum relative to the past fiscal year 
was held to a 34-year low of 0.9 percent. Although the MOF had 
raised a trial balloon in the opening skirmishes with its 
observation that "reductions are even possible," the self 
defense agency had countered that an estimate request amounting 
to a 1.95 percent increase was its limit since personnel costs 
and payments on out-year obligations would consume some 80 
percent. 
  That much was the overt tug of war, but according to persons 
involved, the two agencies were negotiating while running trial 
calculations on multiple cases, at growth rates of nearly zero, 
1 percent, and so on. Not only with defense funds, but also in 
many other instances, concrete discussion are often carried out 
below the surface. 
  Not merely in formalized restoration negotiations but at all 
times the cabinet is having debates so that the process up to 
the point of decision has more persuasiveness in being visible. 
<H5>  Options </H5>
  The "welfare vision" that came under discussion over the 
issue of raising or cutting taxes is said to be drawn up soon by 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare and MOF, and they will lay 
out national obligation rates through fiscal year 2025. Such 
midterm and long-term planning and trial calculations change 
greatly depending on what postulations are made. Annual 
expenditures totally change according to the policy options. 
  Social security burden rates under the national burden rate 
have been worked into future estimates by revising the pension 
system this time, and tax burden rates will be calculated based 
on things such as a set rate of growth, premised on the present 
tax system. 
  It is good to have a number of trial estimates setting 
several premises for the burdens and the benefits. For example, 
such items would be worked in as circumstances altering the 
ratio of the national treasury's burden for medical costs and 
pensions, situations raising the current consumption tax, and 
highs and lows in future economic growth. 
  The bureaucracy is negative about premising such things as 
undecided policies or growth rates conflicting with present 
perspectives. However, if the supply of data for broadening the 
range of options is inadequate, it is criticized as "arbitrary,' 
as it was with the national welfare tax concept. 
<H5>  Midterm Planning </H5>
  It is not that there were no changes whatsoever in positions 
on compiling the fiscal 1994 budget. It was unusual for 
standards for rethinking allocations for public works to emerge 
at midpoint in the form of a report of the Fiscal System Council 
(finance minister's advisory body). 
  Also, the same council's study objects had been only the 
issues wrapped up in the budget compilation at hand; however, 
this time it took up as a midterm item for deliberation the 
disposition of the obligations of the Japanese National Railway 
Settlement Corporation. Nevertheless, the outcome of the 
deliberation did not go beyond stating, "Given the importance of 
this matter, we should broadly seek the public's understanding." 
  For disposing of long-term bonds amounting to some 26 
trillion yen, by fiscal year 1997 the sale of land and Japan 
Railways stocks will be done and the burden of obligations 
remaining at that time will be considered. Chances are high that 
the state will take on most, in short making it a public burden. 
So, the issue is merely being deferred. 
  As a sort of midterm financial plan, the MOF has its 
`midterm 
outlook" which it submits to the Diet each fiscal year; however, 
it was this month that they decided even this would put off the 
four-year-old goal for making the rate of dependence on 
government bond issues (ratio of government bond issues to 
general accounts revenue) within 5 percent. It has done nothing 
but climb because of recession countermeasures and long has been 
a "castle in the air." 
  Total national bond issues are forecast to exceed 200 
trillion yen by the end of fiscal year 1994. Moreover, there is 
the lending and borrowing across fiscal years called a "hidden 
debt" and the National Railways' long-term bonds. The midterm 
plans should be asked to say how these are to be handled. In 
order to conform to the realities, they should be become bold 
enough even to take the intermediate rethinking.

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by reporters Masayuki Tamura </F>
and Toyomiki Sakata, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Tokyo Securities 
Department] 
<H5>  [14 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] There has been an increase in the number of 
stockholders suing corporate management. Since the Commercial 
Code was amended last October, the cost of bringing a class 
action suit on behalf of stockholders has been substantially 
reduced. Managers are beginning to realize that they may be 
personally responsible for huge damage payments if they lose 
suits. The prevailing corporate culture has been severely 
shaken. Until recently, stockholders meetings and corporate 
auditors were considered mere formalities and the system of 
checks and balances is widely believed not to work. While 
managers complain that the amendment is "bad law that will erode 
managerial autonomy," just how will stockholder litigation 
change corporate management practices? 
<H5>  Damage Payment Bonanza </H5>
  "We have no statement to make at this time." Shingo 
Ariyoshi, 
the former president of Mitsui Mining Co. Ltd., did not have 
much to say after the Supreme Court handed down a guilty verdict 
against him in a shareholder suit last fall--the first such 
ruling in its history. After agreeing to buy out major 
shareholders opposed to a joint venture, he forced group 
companies to purchase the shares at a low price. The corporation 
sustained a loss and was sued. 
  One of the six defendants has died since the case first went 
to court 14 years ago. It appears as though the 100 million yen 
in damages--including 80 million yen in interest--will become 
the responsibility of Mr. Ariyoshi and the remaining four 
defendants. A family member of one of the other defendants in 
the case, a former company director, could barely conceal his 
disappointment. "We'll do our best to pay the damages," he said 
as his voice trailed off. 
  Earlier this month, Mitsui Mining announced a net profit of 
100 million yen for the fiscal year ending 31 March 1994. In 
order to pay the damages and avoid going into the red, the 
company will have no other choice but to sell some of its 
assets. Ironically, the damages paid by the old management team 
will erase the profits they managed to generate for the company 
and its stockholders. 
  A stockholder litigation procedure was first introduced in 
the 1950's. Under the Commercial Code and the Civil Code, 
company directors are responsible for corporate performance. As 
members of the board of directors, the highest decisionmaking 
body in the company, they are obligated to oversee the conduct 
of the president and other top executives. They are not only 
accountable for corporate losses, they are also liable for 
damages should they allow company executives to conduct 
corporate affairs recklessly. 
  However, one major obstacle to those seeking redress was 
very 
high court fees in proportion to the size of damages. For this 
reason, there were few lawsuits. These court fees were reduced 
to 8,200 yen under the recent amendment to the Commercial Code. 
With this change, litigation activity has increased against a 
backdrop of continuing disclosures of corporate wrongdoing. 
  There have been more than 10 suits in the past year alone, 
including the ones brought against the directors of Janome 
Machine Co. and Hazama Co. An official in the Civil Affairs 
Bureau at the Ministry of Justice believes that there have been 
many more undisclosed cases. According to officials at the 
Supreme Court, 84 cases were still pending as of the end of 
1993. At the present time, lawsuits are reportedly being 
prepared against company directors at Kagoshima, Obayashi-gumi, 
Daiwa Securities, and the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
  Lawsuits are also proliferating against small and 
medium-sized companies outside of the major metropolitan areas. 
At the end of last year, Hisashi Oda and two other shareholders 
in the Otaru-based Sekiyu Kaiun Co. Ltd. sued the company 
president for 110 million yen. Mr. Oda is a former managing 
director of the petroleum marine transport company. "The 
president purchased a personal membership in a very expensive 
golf club without the permission of the board of directors, 
causing the company to post a loss." 
<H5>  Oversight Group Formed </H5>
  Now, a group has come forward with a proposal advocating the 
formation of an organization called the kebiishi 
(sheriff magistrate) council. During the Heian era (AD 
794-1185), an official by this title maintained social order in 
Kyoto. According to the proposal, an oversight council comprised 
of legal scholars and lawyers would monitor corporate behavior 
under this same name. Last December, an organization called the 
Tokyo Municipal Ombudsman was founded as a first step toward the 
creation of this council. It was formed to facilitate the 
formation of class action suits on behalf of major stockholders 
in listed corporations. Lawyer and founder Toshiaki Takahashi is 
leader of the group which also includes Waseda University 
professor Hiroyuki Ikejima. 
  Professor Ikejima was careful to explain the purpose behind 
the kebiishi council: "Our goal is not to hassle 
company directors but to facilitate stockholder lawsuits as a 
means to bring about sound corporate management." He is 
currently studying the possibility of bringing suit against 
Tokyo Electric Power and Kansai Electric Power. The Electric 
Utilities Association is alleged to have made illegal 
contributions to the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) under the 
guise of advertising fees. 
<H5>  Lawyers Take Initiative </H5>
  Attorneys representing plaintiffs in stockholder cases have 
traditionally worked pro bono. However, lawyers who 
view such cases as a "business" are beginning to appear. This is 
because the legal fees in victorious suits are substantial. 
  In early April, a seminar entitle "How To Bring Suit" was 
held in Tokyo. Many of the lecturers were heard saying the law 
was "just another industry" and that shareholder suits 
represented a "big market." Hidehito Ida, a lawyer who handles 
shareholder lawsuits for clients such as Nomura Securities, 
spoke with great candor. "First, there is the sense of justice 
that corporations should behave properly. Second, there are 
economic merits." 
  The president of a petrochemical company raised his voice in 
anger: "During the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative 
(SII) talks, the United States demanded that shareholder rights 
be strengthened, but the quiet passage of such laws would have 
caused the chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] to commit harakiri." While Keijiro 
Koyama, managing director of Keidanren, agrees that "a 
constructive effort is needed to reform the litigation system to 
ensure proper management of corporations," he privately worries 
about "frivolous lawsuits." 
  Recently, Keidanren has been busy gathering opinions on 
shareholder lawsuits from various industries. It submitted a 
proposal to the Ministry of Justice calling for 1) establishment 
of "managerial decisionmaking principles" not based on results 
and liability, in order to aid in the creation of a rational 
managerial decisionmaking process, and 2) a legal amendment 
putting U.S.-style time limits on stockholders who wish to 
initiate lawsuits. 
  Koichiro Kurasawa, a Keio University professor and member of 
the Legislation Advisory Council, wonder why there is a "sudden 
interest" in time limits. He believes that there could be a 
large number of lawsuits concerning criminal behavior and 
managerial indiscretion dating from the bubble era. A wave of 
lawsuits would indeed serve to remind managers of their legal 
responsibilities. 
<H5>  [15 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] "We are still studying whether to seek damages 
against the former president of a company subsidiary...." The 
words of Yasumasa Koshiba, the president of Isetan, trailed off. 
The corporation had announced losses of 71.6 billion yen for 
FY1993 due to an error in the futures market made by an overseas 
financial subsidiary. Nobuo Nakanishi, the former subsidiary 
president responsible for the loss, has since moved on to Sega 
Enterprises. The hesitancy over seeking damages stems from the 
fact that the case could implicate the founding family, which 
had appointed Mr. Nakanishi. 
<H5>  Statements of Intent Change </H5>
  However, some of the directors at Isetan privately worry 
that 
if the company does not at least make an effort to recover the 
losses in a lawsuit, the board may be sued by stockholders for 
breech of duty. Japanese-style management, which places great 
value on "consideration", is being undermined by stockholder 
class action suits. 
  "I've really been quite busy lately." Shigeru Nakajima, a 
corporate lawyer, serves as legal counsel to approximately 30 
companies in the Tokyo metropolitan area. He receives requests 
almost daily to serve on company boards. 
  At a corporate board meeting in early April, Mr. Nakajima 
was 
bombarded with questions from directors after giving a 
presentation on shareholder lawsuits. "I would like to see us 
increase funding to one of our subsidiaries in order to bail it 
out of its current financial difficulties. Should we worry about 
a potential shareholder lawsuit?" "What are the legal 
implications of voting against a measure at a board meeting?" 
  Proposals are often voted upon at Japanese corporate board 
meetings without much opposition raised. However, if there is no 
record of any opposition to a given venture in the corporate 
minutes, and it is not clear which of the directors favored the 
venture, then all could be held liable in a shareholder lawsuit 
should the venture lose money. 
  Masami Hashimoto is the president of Shin-Etsu Polymer Co. 
"Those opposed to any proposal must speak out and make sure that 
their opposition is recorded in the company minutes." More and 
more top executives are making such statements at the beginning 
of board meetings. 
  Last May, Fuji Bank created a legal affairs department. 
Tokai 
Bank established one in January, with Sakura Bank following suit 
a month later. Sumitomo Bank organized a legal affairs office 
last October. As a legal affairs specialist at a city 
[money-center] bank explained, "the number-one priority is 
shareholder lawsuits." The nature of the position is changing 
rapidly. "Soon everything with legal implications, including the 
results from casual meetings, will be forwarded to us 
automatically so that we can get it in writing." 
  Toshiaki Hasegawa is a lawyer. "Requests from banks and 
securities houses for my legal opinion have doubled over the 
course of the past two or three years. They are seeking input 
from outside specialists in order to compile more accurate 
records." 
<H5>  Solid Bailout Policies </H5>
  Nowhere is this caution more evident than in the number of 
bailout requests from struggling companies that are being 
rejected by banks. Money-center banks such as Tokai Bank are 
turning down requests from nonbank lending institutions to 
postpone interest ayments. Such requests were routinely accepted 
as recently as two years ago. Excessively generous bailouts have 
increased the amount of bad credit at the bank, making it 
vulnerable to shareholder lawsuits. 
  "That was absolutely the wrong thing to say." Commenting on 
the importance of public relations, a lawyer criticized the 
remarks made by a board member at Shinoji Paper in a magazine 
article on the speculative financial losses at the now defunct 
Kanzaki Paper. The director denied any knowledge of the matter, 
claiming that he had "trusted those in charge of the matter." 
The lawyer shook his head. "This indicates a complete abdication 
of oversight responsibilities as a company director. His remarks 
would work to his disadvantage in a shareholder suit, especially 
when the appropriate company records are disclosed." In fact, a 
shareholder lawsuit has been brought against the Shinoji 
director since these comments were made. 
  "The company is in the same industry, and we increased our 
investment after receiving a request from public authorities." 
In mid-March, Nomura Securities announced that it had decided to 
increase its stake in Sanyo Securities. 
  Twenty billion yen will be invested in Sanyo Securities in 
order to help restore it to solvency and reform the nonbank 
lending institution system. Of this total, the Nomura group will 
provide 6 billion yen. Sanyo Securities is deeply in debt and is 
not expected to recover. Nomura has been strongly criticized for 
the move. Unlike banks, which have bad loans to protect, Nomura 
has no direct stake in supporting nonbank lending institutions. 
  Because there are limits on the amount of money the Bank of 
Tokyo and other commercial banks can invest in nonbank lending 
institutions because of stock ownership restraints, the Ministry 
of Finance has put strong pressure on Nomura to participate in 
the bailout. A company official, however, is worried. 
"Stockholders have criticized this bailout as excessive. Despite 
the fact that the request came from public authorities, such 
comments make it clear that stockholders may consider filing a 
lawsuit." 
<H5>  Insurance Applications Soar </H5>
  Given the cost of court fees and potential damages, company 
directors are rushing to apply for liability insurance. AIU has 
been selling liability insurance since 1990, but applications 
doubled after the amendment to the Commercial Code was passed 
last October. Currently, over 300 corporations have applications 
pending. Toshishige Katsuwaki, who heads the office in charge of 
corporate insurance, expects the number of company applications 
to increase once again after June stockholders meetings." 
  Not only is there a sense of crisis brewing at corporations 
over stockholder lawsuits, corporate directors are becoming 
obsessed with protecting themselves. Masanori Yajiro, the 
Citicorp representative in Japan, believes that better 
documentation of proceedings, liability insurance, and the 
opinions of lawyers may not be enough to prevent stockholder 
lawsuits. "Directors must behave more responsibly towards 
shareholders. I believe they should improve daily oversight by 
bringing in outside directors." 
  During the excesses of the bubble economy, many directors 
lost sight of the fact that they were in business to provide a 
reasonable return on investment to those who invest money in the 
company's common stock. That is why corporations are called 
"common stock companies." May the increase in lawsuits serve as 
a warning to those managers who neglect the interests of the 
stockholder.

  [Text] On 11 May, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan stated in Tokyo that he prefer a 
general election under the existing multiseat constituency 
election system. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reacted strongly to 
Murayama's remark, saying: "The remark is problematic. If the 
next election should be held under the existing election system, 
why did we have to carry out political reform? Obviously, some 
people do not want political reform." 
  On top of that, Hata stressed he has no intention of 
dissolving the lower house under the multiseat constituency 
system, and said "it is not time for dissolution of the lower 
house."

  [Excerpt] The Chat Thai Party committee investigating the 
alleged drug links of Thanong Siripichaphong is expected to 
recommend that party leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha ask the Nakhon 
Phanom MP to resign voluntarily from the House to protect the 
party's and Parliament's image. 
  Party sources said the move came after a U.S. federal grand 
jury indicted Mr Thanong on drug smuggling charges three years 
ago. The indictment was only revealed in the United States 
yesterday. 
  The sources said the Chat Thai committee headed by Sa Kaeo 
MP 
[Member of Parliament] Burin Hiranburana would seek a meeting 
with Mr Banhan today where it would ask him to request Mr 
Thanong's resignation rather than expel him from the party. 
  "The committee believes Mr Thanong should resign to show 
political spirit by protecting the image of the party and 
Parliament," said one of the sources. 
  Mr Burin yesterday confirmed the proposal but said this 
would 
only be done if the evidence against Mr Thanong is credible. 
  He said the party's findings would be based on the available 
documentary evidence, press reports, wire agency reports and 
information from government agencies. 
  He said Mr Banhan would sign a letter asking the Prime 
Minister to order relevant government agencies to cooperate with 
the party by making available any information. The agencies 
include the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and Police 
Narcotics Suppression Bureau. 
  Mr Thanong is to testify before the party committee this 
morning at 10.00. The five-man committee will also seek 
meetings with drug suppression officials to obtain more 
information and evidence, said Mr Burin. 
  He said the House of Representatives Affairs Committee had 
already given the party panel permission to attend its meetings 
and to use its information. 
  "I think the Chat Thai panel will be able to complete its 
probe within the 15-day limit given by the party," he said. 
  The panel is expected to prepare a summarized report by May 
20 for submission to Mr Banhan 
  Panel member Man Patthanothai will look into the legal 
implications and problems connected with the case. 
  Mr Burin said the United States was only proceeding with 
civil action against Mr Thanong, but criminal action should also 
be taken if it has information linking him to marijuana 
smuggling. 
  "Senior party figures will decide what to do once we finish 
our probe, but one option is that Mr Thanong could review his 
position in an effort to save the image of the party and 
Parliament," he said. 
  Party sources said Mr Banhan wanted to act responsibly but 
has chosen not to launch an investigation by saying the matter 
occurred before Mr Thanong joined Chat Thai. 
  One source said Chat Thai would take real action against Mr 
Thanong and would not let things drag on or try to defend him 
because the allegation is causing severe damage to the party.

  [Text] The Philippines and Malaysia agreed yesterday to 
issue border-crossing passes to their nationals in Mindanao and 
Sabah in a bid to clear a major irritant in their diplomatic 
relations. 
  Officials from the two countries also agreed to work out 
ways 
to regulate and improve border trade, curb piracy, gunrunning, 
drug trafficking and other crimes, and control the spread of 
disease and marine pollution. 
  The measures were drawn up during a three-day meeting of the 
Philippines-Malaysia Joint Committee on Border Cooperation, 
which ended yesterday. 
  Another meeting will be held by the committee in Kuala 
Lumpur 
in December to finalize details of how the regulations will be 
implemented, possibly by 1 January next year. 
  Diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Malaysia 
were upset with the roundup in March of almost 2,000 suspected 
Filipino illegal workers in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Labuan. 
  Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino, head of the 
Philippine panel, said special passes will be issued to those 
crossing the border between Southern Philippines and East 
Malaysia. 
  In a press conference, Severino said the border cooperation 
agreement will benefit Filipinos who are staying in Sabah. 
Estimates of the number of Filipinos in the Malaysian state vary 
from 190,000 to 500,000. 
  He said entry points will be designated by both countries 
where the special documents for people and vessels can be 
secured. 
  Documents obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE showed that the 
Philippines and Malaysia have both designated three border areas 
and crossing points where entry and exit of people and vessels 
will be monitored. 
  According to a copy of the draft of minutes of the joint 
committee's first meeting, Manila has designated as border areas 
the municipality limits of the provinces of Tawi-Tawi and Sulu, 
and the Balabac Island group. 
  Malaysia, for its part, designated Sandakan, Semporna, and 
Tawau, an official said. 
  The border-crossing passes, the document said, will be 
issued 
only to Filipinos or Malaysians who have been residents of their 
respective border areas for at least three years preceding the 
date of application, or a lesser period mutually agreed upon. 
  It will be valid only for single entry and for 60 days from 
the date of issue, and for a period of stay not exceeding 30 
days from entry into the border area of the other country. 
  Severino and his counterpart, Tan Sri Ahmad Kamil Jaafar, 
secretary general of Malaysia's foreign ministry, agreed that 
border crossing has been one of the most serious irritants 
facing the two countries. 
  "Between two neighbors, there is bound to arise both 
opportunities and problems with respects to any kind of human 
activities," Severino said. 
  "Some are related to the movement of people and goods and it 
is therefore necessary to regulate these movements." 
  Jaafar acknowledged that relations between the two countries 
have been abnormal. "But we are now putting that behind us now. 
We have spent too much time in the past 30 years and we must 
now move it to a higher plane," he said. 
  The joint committee will also establish border patrol, 
customs and immigration offices in designated entry points. 
  Created last 10 December during the first meeting of the 
Philippines-Malaysia Joint Commission, the committee is in 
charge of facilitating and regulating activities of people 
between the 
border.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- The time is not yet ripe for 
Japan and the United States to resume ministerial talks in the 
deadlocked trade "framework" negotiations, a senior Trade 
Ministry official said Thursday [12 May]. 
  Both parties should first lay the groundwork for the 
resumption of the framework talks through subcabinet-level 
negotiations, said the official at the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry, who declined to be identified. 
  As one option, the official cited the possibility of sending 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, 
to Washington. 
  But dispatch of cabinet ministers like the foreign minister 
would not be timely, the MITI official said, noting that sending 
such high-ranking officials with no specific proposals would 
further undermine the already-soured trade ties with Washington.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- A high court ruling that 
government screening of some history school textbooks describing 
Japan's wartime atrocities has become irrevocable following the 
state's failure to appeal to the Supreme Court by the Tuesday 
[10 May] deadline, plaintiffs in the case said Thursday. 
  The Tokyo High Court on Oct. 20, 1993, ordered the 
government 
to pay 300,000 yen in compensation to Saburo Ienaga, 80, a noted 
historian and professor emeritus of Tokyo University of 
Education, the predecessor of Tsukuba University. Ienaga 
claimed the Education Ministry had illegally ordered him to 
change eight descriptions in a high school textbook on Japanese 
history he had written, and the high court accepted his 
complaint on three of the eight points. 
  One point was an account of the 1937 Nanjing massacre, which 
the judge said reviewers were wrong to change and that the 
account was "the prevailing view in the academic community" at 
the time the book was screened. 
  Another point, which had been accepted by a lower court, was 
the deletion of a passage saying the Imperial Government of the 
1860's broke a promise to halve a tax on rice farmers. 
  Ienaga and his lawyers met reporters and said the illegality 
of textbook screenings has been fixed for the first time. The 
lawsuit was the third filed by Ienaga in his nearly 30-year 
legal battle against textbook screening. 
  According to precedents, the government is thought to have 
been able to appeal until Tuesday in a legal procedure called an 
incidental appeal, the lawyers said. The Education Ministry, 
however, said it had interpreted this differently and it is 
still able to appeal. 
  Ienaga has appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the 
ministry's screening system violates a ban on censorship 
contained in the Constitution.

  [Text] Technical delegations from the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR] Ministry of Communications, 
Transport, Posts, and Construction and the Kingdom of Thailand's 
Ministry of Communications held a consultative meeting at the 
Mekong Hotel in the capital, Vientiane, from 5-7 May. 
  After the meeting, the two sides officially signed a 
memorandum on cooperation in passenger and transit goods 
transport. Signing the memorandum for the Lao side was Himmakon 
Manotham, deputy minister of communications, transport, posts, 
and construction and head of the Lao negotiating team. The Thai 
side was represented by Charat Phuachuai, deputy minister of 
communications and head of the Thai delegation. The document 
was signed in the presence of Bouathong Vonglokham, minister of 
communications, transport, posts, and construction; Phouthong 
Seng-akhom, deputy mayor of Vientiane Municipality; 
representatives of other concerned ministries; chiefs, deputy 
chiefs, and technical officials from the two ministries; 
representatives of state and private enterprises; and a large 
number of Lao and Thai reporters. 
  The memorandum clearly spells out regulations on 
cross-border 
transport between Laos and Thailand, the entry of Thai transport 
vehicles into Laos, and the opening of passenger bus services 
between Vientiane and Bangkok in the next two months by the 
Vientiane Municipal Administration and the Thai Transport 
Company. The two sides agreed to establish a warehouse for 
transit goods in Vientiane under the joint supervision of the 
LPDR Ministry of Communications, Transport, Posts, and 
Construction and the Thai Express Transport Organization. The 
two sides also agreed to recognize the validity of drivers 
licenses issued by the two countries for driving in the border 
provinces. Drivers travelling to areas outside the border 
provinces will be required to have an international drivers 
license. 
  The two sides will set up a joint committee to oversee the 
future implementation of these regulations based on the 
principles of solidarity, friendship, brotherliness, and mutual 
benefit.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Slams S. Korean Puppets' Development of </F>
Chemical Weapons" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the South Korean puppets' development of chemical 
weapons. 
  The news analyst cites data on the production of chemical 
weapons openly promoted in South Korea after the 
"civilian"-veiled warmaniacs took office. 
  He says: 
  Last year the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique made public an 
official "decision of the government" to possess chemical 
weapons, stressing the need to build up its own strong 
biochemical warfare capacity. 
  The decision of the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs to overtly 
possess chemical weapons, mass-destruction weapons which are 
banned worldwide, shows their war frenzy has gone so far as to 
ignore international law. 
  They are developing and stockpiling large quantities of 
chemical weapons such as nerve, corrosive, toxic, choking, 
disabling and irritant agents. 
  Army corps and divisions of the South Korean puppet army 
have 
chemical warfare units, which continuously hold chemical shell 
firing drills. 15 chemical attack units are deployed along the 
front. [sentence as received] 
  The production of chemical weapons and preparations for 
chemical warfare which the South Korean puppets are feverishly 
hastening, taking advantage of the U.S. imperialists' chemical 
warfare preparations show the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique is 
a group of rare warmaniacs in the world. 
  The South Korean puppets are desperately trying to plunge 
fellow countrymen into the scourge of nuclear weapons and toxic 
gas. They will inevitably be denounced and spurned by the 
nation and the world.

<F P=106> [By Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun] </F>
  [Text] With the approaching deadline for submitting a 
report on the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security 
Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] again 
notified North Korea, as it did previously, that it will send an 
inspection team as soon as North Korea allows the sampling of 
spent fuel when nuclear fuel is replaced. 
  In a message sent to North Korea early this morning, the 
IAEA 
reminded North Korea that the deadline for submitting a report 
to the UN Security Council is approaching, and stated that even 
though the inspection on the replacement of fuel rods has been 
delayed considerably, it will send an inspection team around 
this weekend if North Korea accepts the IAEA proposal by this 
week. 
  The IAEA expects North Korea to show a positive response 
this 
week or early next week depending on the result of the recent 
contacts with the United States. However, in case North Korea 
shows a negative response, including the replacement of nuclear 
fuel on its own, the IAEA's position is that a report to the UN 
Security Council will be inevitable.

  [Text] Yomitan [Okinawa] -- At a time when the return of 
the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield is becoming a hot issue, it was 
learned on 12 May that the Yomitan village government, which is 
planning to build a new village government building on the site 
of the airfield, has asked the Naha Defense Facilities 
Administration Bureau [NDFAB] to allow Yomitan Village to share 
in the use of parts of the airfield with the U.S. Forces so that 
construction work on the village government building can be 
started in fiscal 1995. 
  Since the airfield is state property, use of the site will 
require the permission of the Ministry of Finance. However, 
according to village officials, the permission may be granted as 
early as the first half of fiscal year 1994. 
  According to village officials, the village started 
negotiations with the NDFAB in 1991 with the aim of seeking the 
"outright return of the airfield," or if not, "shared use of the 
airfield." Meanwhile, basic design for the new village 
government building was completed at the end of fiscal 1992, and 
the construction plan has been decided upon. Yomitan plans to 
finish the operational designs this fall, start construction 
work in fiscal 1995, and complete it in fiscal 1996 for the 
village government to move in. 
  While there have been moves toward the return of the 
airfield 
this spring, the village government thinks that this will not 
come in time for architectural design work in the fall. Thus, 
it has attempted to negotiate shared use of the airfield. 
  According to the basic design, the village building will be 
located on a site extending from the center of the runway to the 
northeast, near the Heiwa-no-Mori ball park and sports ground. 
The building is designed to be a four-story structure, with one 
floor underground and three floors aboveground, and a total 
floor area of 6,376 square meters. It will also have a parking 
lot, and the village civic hall is scheduled to be moved to a 
nearby site. 
  At present, the U.S. Forces also share the use of the 
Heiwa-no-Mori ball park and sports ground. The U.S. military is 
hesitant to return the auxiliary airfield because of possible 
hindrance to telecommunications at the neighboring Sobe 
Communications Station after the return. However, Yomitan 
claims that "the construction of the ball park and other 
facilities proved that there has not been any radiowave jamming."

  [Text] The government plans to ask Taiwan, which hopes to 
gain membership in GATT, to abolish its discriminatory trade 
measures aimed at Japan, and lower its tariff rates. Japanese 
officials plan to conduct negotiations with Taiwanese officials 
at the same time as a working-level meeting is being held 17 May 
in Geneva to discuss Taiwan's bid for GATT membership. The 
Japanese officials plan to submit a list of Japan's requests at 
that time. 
  Taiwan has prohibited the importation of automobiles and 
several other products from Japan. Unless Taiwan abolishes such 
protectionist measures, the Japanese Government does not plan to 
support the country's bid for GATT membership. 
  In addition to automobiles (excluding those with engine 
displacement exceeding 3,000 cubic centimeters), Taiwan has 
prohibited imports of motorcycles, liquor, cigarettes, and 
apples from Japan to protect its domestic industries. The 
country has also placed restrictions against Japanese firms' 
entries in bids for government procurement contracts. However, 
Taiwan has opened its markets to automobiles and motorcycles, 
among other products, shipped from Europe and the United States. 
Therefore, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
considers "Taiwan's measures are discriminatory against Japan." 
  The government also plans to ask Taiwan to lower its tariff 
rates in addition to abolishing such discriminatory measures. 
Although the average tariff rate is 5 percent in Taiwan, tariff 
rates on durable consumer products are still very high. For 
example, the tariff rate is 30 percent on automobiles, 42 
percent on trucks, and 22.5 percent on video tape recorders. 
The government plans to ask Taiwan to lower tariff rates 
especially on these items. 
  Along with Taiwan, the PRC has been making preparations to 
gain membership in GATT by the end of this year. GATT member 
nations have agreed that "Taiwan will join GATT after the PRC 
has joined." The PRC has also virtually approved Taiwan's 
membership in GATT.

  [Text] On 7 May, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] revealed its decision to introduce the security 
export control (know control) system as early as June -- under 
the system, companies will determine whether their exports could 
be used as materials for weapons of mass-destruction such as 
nuclear arms and at facilities for producing weapons. In 
response to the collapse of the Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) at the end of March, MITI 
has decided to introduce the system as part of the new export 
control system for arms-related materials. The decision aims at 
establishing a strict export control system by using the 
expertise of exporting companies which are familiar with the 
performance of export goods and the actual conditions of 
importing companies. Since the importance of the 
nonproliferation of nuclear and other weapons was pointed out at 
the Tokyo summit (meeting of leaders of the seven industrialized 
nations) last year, Japan has decided to internationally spell 
out its new policy on export control with the Naples summit set 
for July. 
  While exports of certain items are restricted under Japan's 
current export control system, other goods are free to be 
exported. On the other hand, the "know control" system, which 
will be introduced, will designate countries subject to export 
regulations, and will restrict exports of not only designated 
items but also general-purpose goods. 
  Based on the new system, exporting companies will check the 
possibility that even general-purpose goods may be transformed 
into weapons in importing countries. If there is such a 
possibility, companies will have to cancel the exports 
voluntarily. Even if companies fail to find the possibility, 
the government may take a view that exported products could be 
transformed into weapons. In this case, the government will 
urge companies to confirm the final purpose of use of export 
goods in importing countries. 
  The "know control" system has already been introduced in the 
United States, Germany, and Britain since 1991. The Japanese 
system will be basically the same. 
  However, it is feared that, through the introduction of 
these 
measures, "the government may force export companies to closely 
investigate the actual situation of importing companies" (as 
stated by the MITI's International Trade Administration Bureau). 
In order to minimize such a burden on exporting companies, 
unlike the U.S. and European systems, the Japanese system will 
set standards concerning the extent of companies' investigation 
so that they can prove that they fulfilled their obligation to 
study the possibility of their exported goods being transformed 
into weapons. 
  Moreover, MITI intends to take measures not to discourage 
companies' trade with countries subject to export regulations, 
by excluding items that have nothing to do with the production 
of weapons from the list for export control. 
  The United States and the other countries have introduced 
the 
"know control" system because regulations on items that could be 
used for nuclear arms, biological and chemical weapons, and 
missiles are insufficient in preventing arms proliferations. 
  Agricultural chemicals were used to make chemical weapons in 
the 1984 Iran-Iraq war. As regional conflicts have intensified 
with the years, it has become necessary to take measures to 
prevent general-purpose goods from being transformed into 
weapons. As a result, the "know control" system was worked out 
in the United States and Europe. In Japan as well, the Security 
Trade Control Panel of the Industrial Structure Council (an 
advisory council to the MITI minister) submitted to MITI in June 
of last year a report which recommended the establishment of an 
export control system like those in the United States and 
Europe. In response to this, MITI has been studying the idea. 
  While the United States is an advanced nation in the field 
of 
the "know control" system, there were demands in the U.S. 
Congress for abolishing the system to lighten the burden on 
companies. Therefore, MITI was watching the situation concerning 
the system in the United States. However, now that the United 
States is certain to continue the "know control" system, MITI 
has made the final decision to introduce the system in Japan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the </F>
Liberal Democratic Party, by unidentified editorial staff 
member: "The Hata Administration Is Unstable: Sound 
Parliamentary Democracy Should Be Restored"; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet has finally 
started. 
  [Mori] Now, we can win back the political regime which is 
within our reach. It has become apparent that the foundation of 
the coalition government is unstable. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your impression of the new 
cabinet ministers? 
  [Mori] I feel the true character of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] is being exposed. Also, the vicious aspect of the old 
constitution has surfaced. It seems that the politicians on the 
verge of retirement are feeling that, at any rate, (Prime 
Minister Tsutomu) Hata is not likely to stay in his position 
long, and have appeared on the stage requesting that they should 
be appointed cabinet ministers as they can not wait any longer. 
In that sense, I feel the new cabinet is "the Last Supper" 
cabinet. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How will the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] challenge the new cabinet? 
  [Mori] Haste makes waste. Though people are talking as they 
like about (LDP President Yohei) Kono and Mori as being 
irresolute and indecisive, you should never corner your opponent 
hastily when the opponent is in a fix. If you deliberately 
drive your opponent into a corner, it is certain that he will 
reveal his true character. We are to attack our opponent by 
waiting. 
  We have not failed at all. Even political reform has been 
carried out based on the LDP's proposal. We have performed our 
duties cleverly, utilizing the opponent's power. When a 
political regime collapses, it always collapses from inside, and 
not as a result of a nation being weakened. Election is the 
only other method for changing a political regime. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Discord is still being created within the 
party. 
  [Mori] Though the members who left the party try to give 
plausible reasons for their behavior, there is a strong feeling 
among them that "Representative Masayoshi Takemura and other 
members of Sakigake [Harbinger] alone are enjoying their 
enviable positions after skillfully leaving the party". 
Besides, they are aware of the problem of electoral districts 
(that it becomes difficult to obtain party approval under the 
single-seat district system). Literally, they are merely 
concerned about their selfish interests and tactics. Anyway, 
wistful members have all left the party. There is no one left. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] A critical situation was created 
temporarily when Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister, was about to leave the party. 
  [Mori] Though Mr. Watanabe did not say it expressly, he 
thinks the problem of reorganization of the political world, 
which has been discussed since last year, was originally started 
when the Keiseikai [Takeshita faction] was split. Therefore, he 
strongly believes that politicians of the same philosophy should 
work together to perform their duties entrusted to them by the 
people. It is very impolite to try to utilize such a person. 
As a human being, you should not do such a thing. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about your alliance with the SDPJ, 
which is on the same side with the LDP as a nongovernment party? 
  [Mori] We should not touch on policy problems. The time is 
not yet ripe to obtain a consensus within the party. What 
matters seriously is the fact that a political regime has been 
established that excludes the leading party and the second 
party, which represent the people's will. No doubt, the result 
of the election is being disregarded. It is nothing but the 
selfish behavior of a particular party. It is literally power 
politics. We are asking the SDPJ to cooperate with us to 
restore sound parliamentary democracy. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Are you not aiming to form an LDP-SDPJ 
alliance? 
  [Mori] If a policy consensus can be formed in the process of 
our discussions, we may establish an organization for discussion 
and study the problem. It is desirable for the two parties to 
coordinate their opinions in dealing with the problem of tax 
reform, as well as the problem of security, including the 
problem involving the DPRK (North Korea). However, it is not 
our final objective to do so. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is it not possible for the LDP to be 
allied with the SDPJ if their consensus consists of the nine 
items which constituted the consensus between the SDPJ and the 
coalition parties? 
  [Mori] Well, you are right. Through participation with the 
coalition government, the SDPJ has also become quite close to us 
as far as their policies are concerned. The similarity between 
the two parties is being revealed. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] People say that "the Hata administration 
will face a crisis in June." 
  [Mori] Dissolution and general election come under the prime 
minister's authority, and we are not supposed to handle such 
matters. We are now working on dividing the single-seat 
districts. The Hata administration may also be of the opinion 
that the next election should be carried out under the new 
system. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the circumstances do 
not allow the Diet to be dissolved until after autumn? 
  [Mori] My answer is yes, if we see the situation in terms of 
common sense. Even if things go smoothly, the budget is to be 
approved in the House of Representatives in the middle of June. 
It is physically impossible to discuss the bill concerning the 
new electoral districts before that date. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the summit (meeting of leaders of 
seven major industrial nations) to be held in July affect [the 
political situation in Japan]? 
  [Mori] It is internationally impolite for a prime minister 
who is to leave his post soon to attend such a meeting. 
Besides, the same situation will be repeated for two 
consecutive years. Domestic confusion should not be brought into 
the meeting. Depending on how Hata is going to deal with the 
situation, the LDP is ready to deal with the situation, taking 
the national interests into consideration. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Yet, is it not possible that a vote of 
no-confidence in the cabinet will be called for, and an election 
under the existing medium-sized district system will take place 
with the dissolution of the Diet? 
  [Mori] Such a situation can take place. The question is 
whether (Shinseito Secretary Secretary Ichiro) Ozawa is ready to 
admit the fault of his own techniques. Judging from his 
character, he is not likely to do so. We all must reap as we 
have sown. Last year, while staying in the center of power 
comfortably, they voted no-confidence in their boss (ex-Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa) under the flag of justice named 
political reform. God will not forgive, them even if they 
deceive the general public.

<F P=106> [Interview with Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Socialist Party [DSP]; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano's resignation? 
  [Ouchi] The issue cannot be settled by merely withdrawing 
his remarks. In view of the fact that his remarks have had a 
serious effect on various concerned countries, he has to take 
the blame for making them. And it is appropriate for him to 
decide to resign. It was extremely inappropriate for him to say 
that "[the Nanjing masscare] is a fabrication." 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How about the effect on the political 
situation? 
  [Ouchi] The new cabinet has just been formed, the Hata 
administration will have to undergo a serious ordeal such as 
attacks by opposition parties. And the cabinet will have to 
overcome various trials. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The idea of forming a new parliamentary 
group, "Kaishin" [Innovation], has caused the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] to secede from the coalition. Mr. 
Chairman, was this idea worked out by you? 
  [Ouchi] That is correct. Since gaps were noted between the 
SDPJ and other coalition parties, there was a danger that these 
gaps could lead to the breakup of the coalition. Therefore, 
setting aside my own personal feelings, I had been thinking of 
forming a stable parliamentary group. It would have been 
undesirable for conflict to arise every time the issue of the 
DPRK's (North Korea) development of nuclear weapons is brought 
up. With the idea of forming such a parliamentary group in 
mind, I called a meeting of the party executives on 22 April. 
Then, I directly informed General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa 
(of the the DSP) and Representative Ichiro Ozawa (of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party]) of this idea and asked their views. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How did Mr. Ozawa respond at that time? 
  [Ouchi] Very simply, he said that "he would agree to the 
idea." When I asked him if "he was opposed to the idea of 
including Sakigake [Harbinger]," he answered that he "was not 
opposed to it." Therefore, I thought it was all right to go 
ahead with the plan. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Did you talk to Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama of the SDPJ? 
  [Ouchi] I said to Mr. Murayama: "In viewing the situation 
from a broader point of view, we intend to form a parliamentary 
group composed of the Japan New Party, Sakigake, DSP, and 
Shinseito, although it would be impossible to win the SDPJ's 
immediate understanding." In response, Mr. Murayama said: 
"Yes, that is right. Why do you not go ahead with the plan?" 
I asked for his understanding that this group would be formed 
with four parties. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Maintaining that the act "constitutes a 
breach of faith," the SDPJ has seceded from the coalition. What 
do you think of this? 
  [Ouchi] It would be understandable if they seceded from the 
coalition because of a disagreement in policies. However, since 
the administration is different from the parliamentary group, I 
do not think it is a good reason for them to secede from the 
coalition. I think that the decision was made basically because 
of their original intention to cooperate with the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP], and it just so happened that the forming 
of a new parliamentary group has given them a good excuse to 
secede from the coalition. It is contrary to the fact to say 
that our decision was "a complete surprise" to them. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the change of the 
administration this time? And what role will the DSP play in 
the future realignment of political circles? 
  [Ouchi] If the realignment of political circles should be 
based on the new electoral system, it will be a task involving 
all political parties. Now that the SDPJ has become an 
opposition party, it will be difficult--when viewed from the 
standpoint of common sense--for the SDPJ to promote regrouping 
of political parties through its cooperation with the LDP. The 
realignment should not be carried out without following some 
principles. What is most important is that an accord should be 
reached on basic policies. With our political ideology, 
characteristics, and policies, it is always possible for our 
party to play the leading role in promoting the realignment of 
political circles. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hosokawa cabinet was criticized 
for allowing its operations to be managed under the leadership 
of Shinseito and Komeito. It seems that such a tendency will be 
further strengthened under the Hata administration. What is 
your view on this point? 
  [Ouchi] When the idea of the National Welfare Tax was 
brought up without going through sufficient deliberations, we 
dauntlessly asked for the idea to be revised. In the Hata 
cabinet are many cabinet members who are members of Shinseito or 
Komeito. Nevertheless, in aiming to create an open cabinet we 
will do our best to promote cooperation within the cabinet. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] As a result of the issue of forming the 
new parliamentary group "Kaishin," some members of the DSP as 
well as labor unions that support the DSP have raised the issue 
of the chairman's responsibility. What do you have to say on 
this point? 
  [Ouchi] The idea of forming the parliamentary group was 
based on the unanimous approval at a meeting of the party organ. 
If criticism is based on the result, the idea has certainly led 
to the unfortunate result of the SDPJ's secession from the 
coalition. However, none of our party members are opposed to the 
idea of forming the group. With regard to the issue of my 
responsibility in dealing with this matter, I would listen to 
criticism with modesty. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Have you ever thought of any concrete 
plans to take responsibility? 
  [Ouchi] It will be necessary to think about how to take 
responsibility. However, I do not think it is proper for me to 
take responsibility right now. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the "Kaishin" group become a 
political party before the next election? 
  [Ouchi] For the time being, it will be a floor group in the 
Diet that supports the Hata administration. If a relationship 
of confidence between each other should develop, the coalition 
parties will play the central role in the realignment of 
political circles. It will take considerable discussions before 
the group can be developed into a new party. Viewed from the 
standpoint of size, we cannot say that the realignment has been 
completed when the size of all the political parties that have 
joined the coalition this time is taken into consideration. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The opposition parties are already 
engaged in discussing the possibility of dissolving the House of 
Representatives or calling for a no-confidence vote on the 
cabinet. What do you think of it? 
  [Ouchi] Some people may have such views. However, since the 
opposition parties are willing to cooperate in the enactment of 
the budget and other bills, I do not think that for the time 
being the management of state affairs will be hampered. During 
this period, measures will be worked out to strengthen the 
coalition, and I will make efforts to this end. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Which system does the DSP intend to 
support, the system of two major parties or the system of 
multiple parties? 
  [Ouchi] An urgent question lies in preparing for a situation 
in which there will be several political parties, and also in 
creating two administrations (that can be replaced by each 
other). I do not have any idea that multiple parties should be 
reorganized into two major political parties.

  [Text] Now that six members of Komeito have become 
ministers in the Hata cabinet, the party will play a major role 
in administration of the minority ruling parties. While the 
party is excited at being in such a position, bewilderment is 
spreading in the party. Originally, there was strong concern in 
the party and "Soka Gakkai," a large religious group supporting 
Komeito, over other parties' opposition to a leading role for 
the "Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-Komeito bloc" in the 
coalition administration. Because their "leading role" has 
become apparent since formation of the new cabinet, this concern 
has also led to apprehension about the party's future because 
the administration "may remain in the minority force." It is 
likely that for the time being Komeito will not participate in 
the new parliamentary group "Kaishin," which has prompted the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to secede from the 
coalition. And, the party will likely try to consolidate its 
internal structure while urging the SDPJ to return to the 
coalition. 
  The SDPJ's secession from the administration was an 
unexpected incident for Komeito as well. On 28 April when the 
new cabinet was inaugurated, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ishikawa said to a party general meeting of both lower and upper 
house members: "The situation does not allow us to be pleased 
with the increase of Komeito cabinet members from four to the 
current six." Ichikawa thus admonished against the optimistic 
view within the party, and stressed a sense of crisis about 
Komeito having become one of the minority ruling parties. 
  The party plans to put off its participation in "Kaishin" 
for 
the time being, because it intends to serve as a "mediator" in 
the future in persuading the SDPJ to return to the 
administration. A senior Komeito member says: "If Komeito 
makes a move now, this will stimulate the SDPJ to confirm its 
determination to leave the coalition. We want to continue to 
persuade it to return to the coalition." Takenori Kanzaki, 
former posts and telecommunications minister, who has now 
returned to party affairs, stated in an NHK discussion program 
on 8 May: "We had better watch the situation for a while 
regarding this issue." 
  Before the SDPJ left the coalition, Ichikawa and Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa urged the SDPJ to understand the 
need to raise indirect taxes, including the consumption tax, and 
to deal with the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected 
nuclear weapons development, through such occasions as meetings 
of the coalition policy council. However, the actual situation 
concerning Komeito is that women within Soka Gakkai have still 
expressed a strong opposition to the consumption tax hike, and 
that the party "has not yet discussed the final details of 
measures to deal with North Korea, including the extent of 
Japan's possible logistical support for the U.S. forces" (as 
stated by a member in charge of policies). 
  In an effort to soften internal dissatisfaction with Komeito 
acting in concert with Ozawa, Ichikawa has begun to study the 
idea of changing the Komeito image that Ichikawa's personal 
leadership has so far sustained the party, by gradually 
entrusting management of party affairs to the young combination 
of Kanzaki and Akihiro Ota in the future. 
  Ichikawa has not ostensibly changed his intention to support 
the new administration in carrying out policies, stating that 
"as long as the administration makes adequate decisions on 
policies, the general public will support it." However, with 
the remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano [on the 
1937 Nanjing massacre], the SDPJ has enhanced its opposition to 
the Hata cabinet, and the possibility of the party returning to 
the coalition is now decreasing. It appears that it is not easy 
for Komeito to pave the way for breaking the deadlock in the 
current situation in which the ruling coalition has unexpectedly 
become a minority as a result of the "power game."

<F P=106> [Interview with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the </F>
ruling Japan New Party, by MAINICHI SHIMBUN: place and date not 
given -- from "Listening Without Reservation" column] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Shigeto 
Nagano's resignation as justice minister? 
  [Matsuoka] He has already apologized for his controversial 
remarks, and I am not in a position to comment on his 
resignation. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito are in control of the Hata government, is it not true? 
  [Matsuoka] Outsiders may view the Hata government that way. 
The situation is that, after the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] backed out of the coalition, both Shinseito and 
Komeito had to fill the vacuum left by the SDPJ. We are calling 
on the SDPJ to return to the coalition, and with Shinseito and 
Komeito in the coalition, members of the Hata cabinet can be 
replaced whenever the SDPJ returns to the coalition. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are the coalition partners going to 
coax the SDPJ into the government? 
  [Matsuoka] There is no way but for us to show sincerity. The 
Japan New Party [JNP] is playing a role of holding the coalition 
partners together. The JNP intends to contact the SDPJ through 
various channels and create the climate for the SDPJ to return 
to the coalition. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN) What are the major tasks the Hata 
government must grapple with? 
  [Matsuoka] It goes without saying that the Hata government 
should work for economic recovery. The Hata government will work 
on economic reform, deregulation, and administrative reform, for 
which the Hosokawa government paved the way. The Hata government 
was inaugurated under a banner of continuing those reforms. The 
1975 system [the Liberal Democratic Party-SDPJ system] is in the 
process of collapsing, but I believe that the biggest task for 
the Hata government is to put an end to the system that is still 
active. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] With a minority in the Diet, the Hata 
government is expected to face difficulty in running the Diet. 
How about the possibility of the coalition partners cooperating 
with the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the Diet? 
  [Matsuoka] I believe that past coalition partners deserve to 
be thanked for their efforts to shore up the Hosokawa 
government, and the Hata government should reciprocate their 
efforts. Taking advantage of disarray among the coalition 
partners, the LDP is making moves to forge an alliance with 
conservative members of the SDPJ. If the SDPJ cooperates with 
the LDP in running the Diet, this would be a big minus for it, 
because the coalition government came into being to end the 
one-party rule of the LDP. If the SDPJ cooperates with the LDP 
in steering the Diet, it would make meaningless the efforts that 
we have made over the past eight months. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Details of the political reform remain to 
be work out. What is your opinion? 
  [Matsuoka] We will have to do everything we can do to get 
the 
Diet to pass a bill on the demarcation of single-seat 
constituencies during its current session. The SDPJ held two 
important cabinet posts for political reform and autonomy when a 
new electoral system was adopted. The SDPJ should fulfill its 
responsibility to the end. Some are advocating that the House of 
Representatives should be dissolved and general elections held 
under the present multiseat constituency system. If their 
advocacy is accepted, this would deny the political reform for 
which we have striven so hard. In principle, the general 
elections should be held under a new electoral system. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The JNP is suffering a sharp fall in its 
public support rating. 
  [Matsuoka] That means the difference between the ideal and 
reality. The JNP has taken the position of keeping the 
government in check with the feelings of citizens. The JNP was 
an amateur in politics when it was formed, but it later joined 
the government as a result of representative Hosokawa's 
assumption of the premiership. Our party should deal 
realistically with Diet affairs and in its relationship with 
other ruling coalition parties. Our party can no longer speak 
only of ideals. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How does the JNP plan to win back public 
support? 
  [Matsuoka] Our party is a political group of newly elected 
legislators, but our party is rapidly bolstering its 
policymaking ability. The JNP has set forth policies from the 
position of a civic political party. Our party intends to 
fulfill the public's expectations. We will ask representative 
Hosokawa to assume his duty of running our party. We also will 
ask him to prepare our party for the next leap forward in the 
period of change. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Some members of the JNP have broken away, 
and their breakaway has shaken the JNP. 
  [MAINICH SHIHMBUN] Legislators with various experiences and 
differing views formed the JNP. Essentially, it is difficult to 
hold them together. If they leave the JNP, it would cause big 
troubles. I hope they will remain in the JNP and fight for 
reforms. In last year's general elections, our party won many 
seats with the support of many voters, but our party will be 
unable to win so many seats if it simply relies on the support 
of voters. It is important for the ruling coalition parties to 
create a system under which they make concerted campaigns in the 
next general election. I want to urge the ruling coalition 
parties to create a unified parliamentary group. If the next 
general election is held under the single-seat constituency 
system, a change will occur among the ruling coalition parties. 
I intend to hasten enactment of the bill on the demarcation of 
single-seat constituencies to hold our party together.

  [Text] On 9 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata visited six 
former prime ministers of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] one 
after another to inform them of his inauguration as prime 
minister. They were Noboru Takeshita, Toshiki Kaifu, Takeo 
Fukuda, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Zenko Suzuki, and Kiichi Miyazawa. 
Although the visits were exactly like those made by a newly 
appointed prime minister when the LDP was in power, Hata's 
"modest" visits appear to have been accepted favorably by the 
former prime ministers. Nakasone even gave him a yell, saying: 
"(Although the Hata cabinet is a minority government) there is 
a saying that small is beautiful. So, hold on to it!" 
  Hata stayed at each of their offices for just less than 30 
minutes. Both Takeshita and Miyazawa praised Hata, respectively 
saying: "Since you are a good listener, you will be able to 
manage things successfully," and "You are a first-class person 
in terms of personality." 
  Referring to the fact that Hata served as chairman of the 
LDP's Research Commission on the Electoral System under the 
Kaifu cabinet, Kaifu also said: "Since the outline of political 
reform has been drawn up, I hope you will carry out the 
remaining task of achieving it." Meanwhile, Nakasone said: 
"The right to dissolve the House of Representatives is the 
supreme power given to the prime minister. You should use the 
power with courage no matter what electoral system is used for 
the next general election." In this way, Nakasone indirectly 
opposed Hata's adherence to the idea that constituency 
boundaries should be redrawn for a new single-seat electoral 
system so that the next general election will be held under the 
new system. 
  Maybe because of their warm welcome, Hata seems to have felt 
relaxed. But during the meeting with Miyazawa, he carelessly 
revealed his true feeling about the uproar caused by the 
formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Innovation], due 
to which the Social Democratic Party of Japan had to leave the 
ruling coalition. Hata said: "After all members of the ruling 
coalition parties voted for me in the prime ministerial 
election, some moved to form the new group. I was also offended 
by their act."

<F P=106> [Article by Rikkyo University Professor Shinichi Kitaoka] </F>
  [Excerpts] Under the new election system, elections 
will definitely be party-centered. However, these parties will 
not be organized parties, nor will they be groups of like-minded 
people. These parties will have a structure of a leader and a 
machine which automatically accepts the leader. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The political reform bill was passed at the end of January 
after a great struggle. Needless to say, the core of the bill 
was reform of the election system. As Professor Takeshi Sasaki 
points out, this is the most major system reform carried out 
under the Japanese constitution. With the exception of the 
general election of 1946, the traditional medium constituency 
system has lasted since 1925, when it was first established. 
This reform is the first in 69 years. 
  A total of eight national elections were held under the 
small 
constituency system. Six of them were held between 1890 (22d 
year of Meiji era), when the first general election was held, 
and 1898 when the sixth general election was held. The 14th and 
15th general elections, in 1920 and 1924, were also held under 
this system. However, these elections were restricted elections; 
the number of eligible voters in the first election was 450,000 
(total population was 39.9 million), and in the 14th election, 
3.06 million (total population was 55.39 million). These figures 
cannot compare to the number of eligible voters today, which is 
93 million. 
  Under the Meiji constitutional structure, the House of 
Representatives was just another national organization, and 
there were many powers, such as the House of Peers, the Privy 
Council, not to mention the Army and Navy, which the House of 
Representatives could not effectively control. Elections in 
those days were not given much weight. 
  Above all, Japan during the Meiji and Taisho eras was 
basically a poor agricultural country, in comparison with 
today's Japan, which has achieved a high economic prosperity and 
is highly urbanized. It is unnecessary to reemphasize that this 
is a major difference when it comes to elections. By the way, 
the main issue in the first six elections was the reduction of 
land tax. In short, the election system based on small 
constituencies is a totally new experience for the rich Japan 
under democracy and under the parliamentary cabinet system. 
  Furthermore, since 1955, fairly unique party politics 
existed 
in Japan, where no real competition took place between the 
overwhelmingly powerful main party and powerless nongovernment 
parties. Many arguments about political reform showed lack of 
understanding of the dynamism that party politics should possess 
by nature. They believed that what they had had since 1955 in 
Japan was genuine party politics. 
  This election system reform will bring a substantial change 
to Japan's party politics. As I stated before, this will be a 
new challenge for Japan. In order to identify its direction, it 
is necessary to study the nature of party politics and the 
situation of today's Japanese society. Through this task, this 
article is to discuss political reform, which is expected in the 
near future, and party politics, which goes beyond the reform. 
First, we will discuss some arguments about the recent election 
system reform. 
<H5>  Parties With No Name </H5>
  First, we want to look at the criticism that new parties do 
not have names that correspond with their ideologies and 
principles. This is true with the Japan New Party, Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger]. 
  However, this is an unavoidable phenomenon when the age of 
ideology is coming to an end. Examining Japan's existing 
political parties, the policies of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] or the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot 
necessarily be called general terms, such as liberal democracy, 
or socialism. The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is not solely 
democratic socialist, and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] is 
trying hard to explain that it is not communist. Komeito's name 
[Clean Government Party] has nothing to do with its ideology. 
  When looking around the world, we find that many parties 
have 
"liberal", "democratic" and "national" in their names. There are 
also religious names, such as Christian. Many still use 
"social", "people," and "labor"; however these will not be 
popular anymore. Among all these, "liberal" and "democratic" are 
still popular, and even the extreme rightists in Russia are 
naming themselves the Liberal Democratic Party. "Liberal" and 
"democratic" must be good names. But these names do not function 
to distinguish one party from another anymore. 
  As you can see, it is difficult to ask new political parties 
for names that suit their ideologies and principles. The 
existence of criticism about party names means that there is a 
belief that a political party must be a group of people who 
share common ideology and belief. However, this belief is false. 
  As Max Weber said, there are two types of political parties. 
One type is those whose members share a certain idea, ideology, 
and world view. The other is those whose goal is to obtain a 
government position. We can call them the shared-ideology type 
and power-oriented type. (As you will see, this does not mean 
the former is good and the latter is bad.) Parties possess both 
aspects more or less. But, theoretically there are these two 
types. In addition, I think there is a third type, if parties 
exist, that represents strong subgroups characterized by race, 
language, or religion. 
  U.S. political parties are typically the power-oriented 
type. 
Compared to major parties in Europe, there is very little 
difference between the two major parties in the United States. 
The little difference between them exists due to the 
small-constituency system. This means that parties have 
conflicts in the small-constituency system, and this system 
works in conjunction with the national presidential election to 
create the bipartisan system in the United States. Therefore, it 
is of no use to criticize parties that they have no ideologies 
or beliefs that run through them. 
  In Japan's case, we have very few class, racial, or 
religious 
differences. When the ideology aspect is weak, it is natural 
that power-oriented parties will become the main players. With 
the SDPJ bidding good-bye to socialism, major parties, which had 
tended to be the shared-ideology type, will disappear. 
<H5>  Party, Ideology, Power </H5>
  I want to mention here about the idea of "modernization of 
parties" which once was advocated in the LDP by Mr. Takeo Miki 
and some others. This opinion also had the idea behind it that 
the basis of parties and other political groups is sharing of 
ideologies. Their image of a modern party was that it had many 
members and had a structured organization. Based on this idea, 
it would be difficult to call the LDP, which had diverse 
politicians from the rightist to the leftist, a political party, 
and they would be extremely out of date having several leaders 
who led factions. 
  This criticism of factions came from misunderstanding what 
political parties were. First of all, factions are based on 
common ideas, policies, and political beliefs. Only for the sake 
of simplification are they divided into the so-called "right" 
and "left." When we compare the mainstream conservative 
factions, we can say that the Ikeda-Maeo-Ohira-Suzuki-Miyazawa 
faction is the left, the Kishi-Fukuda-Abe faction is the right, 
and the Sato-Tanaka-Takeshita faction is the middle-of-the-road. 
You rarely see a hawk (hardliner) in the Miyazawa faction or a 
dove (softliner) in the Fukuda faction. It is a surprising fact 
that this form has been lasting over a long period of drastic 
changes. 
  This has something to do with the fact that the major 
factions in the LDP had been after power. Major factions have 
been organized by influential members in order to obtain the 
office of LDP head. The influential leaders would gather their 
supporters, help them in their local precincts, and assign them 
posts. To return the favor, faction members always worked 
together for their leaders' pursuit of power. 
  However, faction leaders have their own ideas, policies, and 
political beliefs. These might have come from their educational 
backgrounds and experiences, or from particular situations. 
Anyway, they do have some ideas of their own. Furthermore, a 
political leader would be asked to speak in various situations, 
and the accumulation of these words would create an overall 
image. His faction would come to share this image. Thus, the 
idea of a leader becomes the idea, policy, and political belief 
of his faction. 
  For example, people who share the same idea as Mr. Shinsuke 
Kishi tend to flock around Mr. Kishi, and as they act with Mr. 
Kishi, his ideas tend to become those of his faction. Also, Mr. 
Kishi had Mr. Toshio Fukuda in mind as his successor, and this 
was based on the closeness of their ideas, and their shared 
experience reinforced this closeness. Thus, the Fukuda faction 
possessed similar ideas and policies to those of the Kishi 
faction. The same thing happened to some extent in the 
transition from the Fukuda faction to the Abe faction. Thus, a 
faction tends to carry on the same ideas and policies even 
though the leadership changes. 
  However, this depends on how the leadership is passed on. 
When the Sato faction became the Tanaka faction, there was an 
intense power struggle, and naturally there is a substantial 
difference between before and after the struggle. 
<H5>  Factions Becoming Like Guilds </H5>
  In recent years, factions have been changing from 
power-oriented groups, which are after the office of the LDP 
head, to guild groups, which have the distribution of posts as 
their objective and which value harmony within the faction. A 
group that fights to make its leader the prime minister and a 
group to maintain faction unity are completely different from 
each other. The latter trend began in the 1980's in the 
establishment of the Suzuki cabinet and the Suzuki faction, 
following the sudden death of Prime Minister Ohira, and it 
spread among the other factions. With these changes in factions, 
cartelization of LDP politics progressed. However, because I 
have discussed this point in another article, I will not go into 
it. ("Bid Farewell To Cartel Politics," CHUO KORON March 1993; 
"From Cartel Politics to Competitive Politics," CHUO KORON 
September 1993) [passage omitted] 
  The LDP's factions used to be power-oriented groups. They 
were not based on solidarity of policies and ideas. However, 
this is the very reason why they came to be unified on policies 
and ideas. But, when a faction becomes like a guild, 
coordination (or harmony) within the faction comes before 
everything else and its unique ideas and policies disappear. If 
factions are power-oriented groups now, one or two of them might 
have withdrawn from the LDP, justifying themselves. The factions 
have weakened this much. 
<H5>  The Time for Leaders To Compete </H5>
  In short, when open power struggles cease to exist in the 
LDP 
or the whole political parties, conflicts on ideas and policies 
grow weaker. Contrary to this, what is happening now is the 
revival of open power struggle--which is party politics--and 
conflicts about ideas and policies are becoming clear. However, 
this conflict manifests itself as a struggle between leaders. 
  Since the establishment of the Japan New Party by Mr. 
Morihiro Hosokawa a year ago, and especially since publication 
of Mr. Ichiro Ozawa's Blueprint for Building a New 
Japan, more and more politicians are publishing books. Some 
are well done, and some are poorly done. But, this is a good 
thing. We are able to learn the ideas and policies of our 
national leaders, and are able to choose. It is also true with 
the SDPJ, which is the last ideology-based party, that the 
leader stands out. 
  Until now, the SDPJ officially has had a socialistic world 
view to bring socialism to realization. However, this view was 
strongest among party activists. The top officials, who are 
members of the Diet, were more realistic. General socialist 
supporters were merely anti-LDP. This shows that there were 
three layers in the structure of the SDPJ party. Therefore, when 
summarizing the party members' (activists') opinions under the 
name of party democracy, the left would always win. The fact 
that the SDPJ is in power, though only partially, changed the 
meaning of the leftwing spring, and made the Diet members lean 
toward their parties. As a result, parties are divided into the 
power-oriented part and the part which has criticism of those in 
power as its motive. (The next generation leftist would be the 
latter.) This would cause an even greater impact than the 
worldwide decline of socialism. 
  This break from being a party with a world view, naturally 
demands a leader. Their hopeful argument to make Mr. Takahiro 
Yokomichi the leader comes up often, showing this trend. 
  One criticism of the small constituency system was that they 
cannot choose candidates, while it is possible to do this under 
the medium constituency system. At the first glance, this may 
sound correct. Under the medium constituency system, people 
could choose whom they liked among the LDP candidates, A, B, C, 
and D. Or one could vote for candidate E because of his 
personality, while he might not particularly like the JCP. 
However, the problem was that there was no telling whether those 
chosen had any influence within their parties. 
  For example, it is very rare that one votes for Miyazawa 
faction candidate A because he wants to support Kiichi Miyazawa. 
For this vote to work effectively, it requires a roundabout 
route. 
  In comparison, last July's election was simpler. The parties 
that made great strides forward were the Japan New Party and 
Shinseito. There might have been various motives, but it is 
safe to think that those who voted for the Japan New Party, in 
essence, voted for Mr. Hosokawa, and those who voted for the 
Japan Renewal Party, voted for Mr. Hata and Mr. Ozawa. In the 
last analysis, it is a matter of whom one wants to support as 
the national leader, as in the presidential election in the 
United States. In fact this is a desirable way to be for the 
national election. This is much healthier than an election 
influenced by local interests. 
  Under the new system, the election will definitely be party 
oriented. However, the parties will not be organized parties nor 
groups of those who share the same ideologies. Their structure 
will be that of a leader and the machine that automatically 
accepts the leader. 
  I would like to mention here, in relation to this, that 
there 
was criticism that the prime minister should not come from the 
number-four party among the coalition. However, this is common 
among coalition governments, and happens all the time in 
countries such as Italy. What is unusual about Japanese 
elections is that it is hard to know who are the heads of the 
parties. The LDP kept its party leader Miyazawa out of the 
public eye, and it fought the election campaign using Shintaro 
Ishihara, Yohei Kono, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had completely 
different political orientations. This was very unusual. When 
the coalition government is established, it would be against the 
rules for Shinseito to support Mr. Ozawa rather than Mr. Hata. 
However, it is not strange that they choose a leader from among 
the heads of individual parties. 
<H5>  Campaign and Parties </H5>
  When tahe political party-oriented time came, a problem 
would 
arise about the relationship between parties and other groups. 
What is interesting about this issue is the criticism that the 
small constituency system makes it hard to produce female 
representatives. When the political reform bill was voted down 
in the House of Councilors, one female Diet member said that it 
was difficult for female candidates to be elected from a small 
constituency. There were also similar criticisms, such as that 
the small constituency system would choke off citizens' 
movements or concerted actions by residents. In short, these 
criticisms mean that the party-centered small constituency 
system would act against minorities and citizens' movements. 
Some went even so far as to say that the small constituency 
system was against democracy. However, many democratic nations 
in the world have the small constituency system, and this 
particular criticism can be ignored. 
  It is a simple misunderstanding that it is difficult for 
female candidates to be elected from a small constituency. This 
is clear when you see the numbers of female candidates elected 
from medium constituencies and small constituencies. The reason 
why the LDP has an extremely small number of female members in 
the House of Representatives is that it is under the medium 
constituency system. The other nongovernment parties have a 
relatively large number of female members. This is due to the 
fact that they do not put up more than one candidate per 
constituency. For nongovernment parties, a medium constituency 
is similar to a small constituency. 
  It is also a mistake to criticize that the small 
constituency 
system would work against concerted actions by residents or 
citizens' movements. Today's election, unless there is a great 
difference in ideologies, is a competition among political 
parties that are more or less alike. People can demand that 
individual candidates make their positions clear concerning the 
environment, consumers' movements, or whatever the issue may be. 
Especially, a nationally organized group movement may allow the 
group to obtain the deciding vote in many constituencies. If the 
competition is close, each candidate would try hard to get their 
support, and these group movements would have increased 
influence on the outcome of the election. 
  This may pressure these citizens' movement groups themselves 
to change. Various campaigns in the past have been unified with 
the SDPJ and the JCP, and this prevented them from spreading. If 
these groups would obtain the deciding vote, their narrow view 
might be corrected. 
  In the past, single-issue politicians could be elected, but 
it was difficult for them to have influence in the national 
government. The largest constituency (opposite of small 
constituency) has been the House of Councilors' national 
constituency and proportional constituency. It was possible 
there to include representatives from minorities and citizens' 
movements, and to make sure that one or two of them were 
elected. However, this could only serve to inform the whole 
country that there are problems in the welfare, tax, sports, or 
whatever field it may be. How much influence it could have was 
questionable. In reality, most policies depended on the 
bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki. 
  In fact, this answers the question why the consumers' 
movement is weak in Japan. Consumers' movements used to have 
close connection with the political reformists. But this 
prevented the movement's expansion. Very few representatives who 
were included in the SDPJ or the LDP, could do very little. 
Movements are movements. Politics is politics. By regaining its 
role, the consumer movement can expand. 
  This is also the key to solving the problem between 
professional politicians and amateur politicians. The complex 
political administration of today cannot be handled part time. 
In order to handle this on site, there are enormous number of 
bureaucrats who work full time. In fact, only the full time 
politicians are able to control these bureaucrats. It may be 
more effective to influence these politicians by citizens' 
movements, rather than having one of the movement leaders become 
a politician. 
<H5>  Problem of Candidates </H5>
  As you can see, it is crucial for a political party to put 
up 
good candidates. Some say that the small constituency system may 
give too much power to headquarters of parties. They may become 
powerful, but it does not mean that they can do anything. 
Democracy is a system of competition, and if the party loses 
because they could not put up good candidates, the party 
headquarters will be responsible. Ichiro Ozawa, when he was 
secretary general of the LDP, resigned his post because his 
party lost in Tokyo gubernatorial election. Although the 
Shinseito-Komeito coalition seems strong, they may be labeled as 
a "a party for which people would not vote for any reason," 
them), and it is very possible that they may lose the election. 
  If the parties would eagerly look for good candidates, one 
big problem would be solved. It is the problem of an increasing 
number of second-generation Diet members. 
  The increase in the number of second-generation Diet members 
is making it difficult for new politicians to enter the 
political world. The same thing is happening in the other 
Japanese industries, also. When Eisaku Sato, Hayato Ikeda, and 
Aiichiro Fujiyama came into the political world, each of them 
was instantly the leader of the party. It is highly desirable 
that people like these three men, who have experience in fields 
outside politics, come into the political world. However, we 
cannot expect that to happen in today's political world. 
Instead, in order to compete with second-generation candidates, 
some candidates do anything to be elected. This is a bad side 
effect of having so many second-generation politicians. 
  However, there is a strong demand for the political world to 
have new politicians. The victory of Rengo in the House of 
Councilors election in 1989, and the last year's victory of the 
Japan New Party was due to the fact that each party provided a 
way for newcomers to enter the political world. If the victory 
depends on whether they can gather enthusiastic, capable men, 
party leaders would try very hard to do that. This would lead to 
finding more talent in Japan. 
<H5>  Political Parties and Bureaucrats </H5>
  Another important thing is the relationship between 
political 
parties and bureaucrats. 
  It is true that the new administration's slogan was to break 
the iron triangle, which represented the connections between the 
bureaucracy, zoku Diet members, and industry. However, some 
criticize that the bureaucrats are getting more powerful. 
  What is being overlooked here is the fact that bureaucracy 
was already at a deadlock. It is true that their Kasumigaseki 
headquarters had a great power, which no other power came even 
near. There, all the ministries and agencies held one another in 
check, each swayed by its own interests. They had lost their 
direction. When this structure falls, it is no wonder that some 
reformist bureaucrats begin more liberal activities. 
  Overthrow of bureaucracy takes a long time and much energy, 
and cannot be accomplished overnight. However, as a start some 
bureaucrats will gain more power, and the rest will gradually 
lose power. Kasumigaseki is still a brilliant think tank. There 
is no other organization that has such detailed knowledge about 
political administration. Overthrowing bureaucracy should mean 
more effective utilization of bureaucrats' great ability. 
  However, this alone is not enough. The limitation, which is 
fatal for bureaucracy, is that it cannot be comprehensive nor 
creative. This is because bureaucrats are to act within the 
rules and precedents, and are not supposed to go beyond them 
easily. 
  In this sense, the Prime Minister's Official Residence needs 
to gain more power, and it is desirable that a solid, 
comprehensive policymaking structure be established in party's 
center or around influential politicians. With the pressure on 
leaders to present their policies, establishment of this 
structure may rapidly progress. 
<H5>  Coming Framework of Conflict </H5>
  What will the framework of coming conflict between parties 
be 
like? The argument often comes up concerning this is the 
argument whether it should be the lenient multipartisan system 
or the bipartisan system. This is not a very appropriate 
argument. When they say lenient multipartisan system, there are 
five to six parties at most, including the LDP, Sakigake and 
others (anti-Shinseito bloc), Shinseito-Komeito-plus others, the 
SDPJ's left wing, and the Japan Communist Party. Even under the 
bipartisan system, there will be the LDP and unified new 
parties, and the SDPJ's left wing and the JCP will remain. 
Therefore there will still be four parties. There is not much 
difference between the multipartisan and bipartisan systems. The 
bottom line would be whether they want two primary parties or 
three. 
  It is very funny to ask party members whether it is going to 
be bipartisan or multipartisan. Whether it will be two parties 
or three parties, is a result. If party members have confidence 
and a strong sense of responsibility in their policies, they 
should try to get the majority, if not, they are being mere 
observers. 
  What could cause parties to oppose each other? One of the 
deciding factors would be whether Japan will willingly play a 
role in the international security or not, that is whether Japan 
is a so-called "normal nation" or not. However it is hard to 
tell if this will be the point of conflict. As I mentioned 
earlier, you cannot explain the difference between the Democrats 
and the Republicans on the basis of ideology. Each of the two 
parties may possess an aspect of "normal nation" and an aspect 
that is not normal. This depends on the future political 
situation. 
  I think Japan should take a nonmilitaristic approach and 
become an "normal superpower." I will not touch this subject 
here, since I have already written an article concerning this 
("Normal Countries and Countries That Are Not Normal" in THIS IS 
YOMIURI February 1994). I just want to mention the minimum 
requirements when policies and ideas are presented. 
<H5>  Ideas and Policies </H5>
  What should parties or leaders present to the people? Many 
say that it is their responsibility to clearly present their 
ideas. However, as I wrote before, it is difficult to present 
clear ideas that will distinguish one from another. Take for 
example, an often talked about idea of "protection of the 
Constitution." There are various ideas in the Constitution, and 
it is difficult to distinguish one party from another solely on 
the basis of protection of the Constitution. The "idea of 
constitutional pacifism" is also vague. The argument that, since 
pacifism is advocated most clearly in the Preamble, Japan should 
act positively for peace, and therefore we should participate in 
PKO [UN peacekeepig operations] more fully can be valid. What 
so-called constitutional protectionists advocate is different 
from this. When they say protection, they mean protection of 
Article of the Constitution. No one is against Paragraph 1 of 
Article 9, and many nations of the world support this principle. 
What is at issue is Paragraph 2 of Article 9. When parties (or 
leaders) present their ideas, I would like them to be very 
specific. For example, they should say that they advocate the 
idea of demilitarization of Paragraph 2 of Article 9. 
  Second, ideas are important, but policies and programs are 
more important. For example, some are insisting, "let's export 
Article 9 of the Constitution to the world." This is good. But I 
have a request. They need to clearly present the way to export 
it. Unless they have a concrete way to make the world "import" 
Article 9, and know how long it will take for the whole world to 
adopt it, and unless they have a program to protect the 
countries from aggressions of other countries during the 
adopting period, it will just be an ideal, a play of words. They 
should clearly present a concrete plan, especially the cost and 
the risk without ignoring time factor, along with the idea. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Political reform is expected to accelerate in the near 
future. However, this article went beyond that and attempted to 
take a midterm view. My suggestion that the time will come when 
leaders will compete on the basis of their policies may sound 
too optimistic. Even if my prediction comes true, this does not 
guarantee a good result. Leaders may fall so low as to be only 
concerned about their popularity, and we cannot deny the 
possibility of people electing such leaders. 
  However, I feel that this is a phase that we must go through 
in the development process of democracy. We must bid farewell to 
the age when even though the voters make a poor choice, 
bureaucrats, the LDP, or the United States will do something to 
take care of it. In this sense, those who are faced with most 
the serious choice are the people themselves. 
  The mass media carry a great responsibility. They must 
change 
their habit of reporting only the criticisms of those in power, 
or basing their report only on human relationship or power 
struggle. They must report politics, which is a mixture of 
ideologies and power, viewing from a proper distance. Their 
attitude since the birth of the Hosokawa administration also has 
leaned too much toward exposing the inner workings of the 
politics and political technique. 
  Finally, quoting Mr. Weber one more time, it is a job of 
very 
few top leaders of parties to present the list of their 
candidates and to present their party policies (New Order 
Germany's Diet and Government). This is where party leaders 
compete, as well as parties. This is the foundation of 
competitive democracy. Then, journalism must devote itself to 
judge political policies and candidates. The future of the party 
politics depends on whether the mass media can fulfill this 
responsibility.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Provokers Will Pay a </F>
Dear Price"] 
  [Text] According to news reports, the U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets recently mobilized the puppet 
Marines and U.S. imperialists' aggressive Marines to the East 
Sea of Korea to once again conduct a provocative exercise for 
strengthening joint air transportation and night exercises. 
  During the military exercise, which was conducted under a 
signboard of a so-called exercise for improving 
interoperability, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets exercised as if in actual combat by landing Marine 
troops with transporters and helicopters in assumed enemy 
territory; bombing major facilities and obstacles, including 
dams and bridges; and eliminating the opponent's troops after 
infiltrating special Marine troops and helicopters. 
  This dangerous fire game [puljangnan] aimed at attacking the 
inland of the Northern half of the Republic clearly shows how 
the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are 
frantically running to provoke a new war. 
  As everyone knows, an extremely grave situation is being 
created on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists are 
gathering aggressive forces on a large scale in South Korea and 
the adjacent areas in order to put in actual practice the 
northward invasion war plan dubbed "New Operation Plan 5027," 
which they devised with the puppets. 
  Apache attack helicopters and new Patriot missiles have 
already been deployed for mobile warfare to South Korea. 
According to data, in case of an emergency on the Korean 
peninsula, the U.S. military is devising a plan to deploy 
600,000 soldiers, over 200 ships, and 1,600 aircraft from the 
mainland of the United States within 80 days. 
  On the other hand, the war maniacs, including the U.S. 
defense secretary, are making a series of ruthless remarks that 
a preemptive attack against North Korea would not be ruled out 
and that they would even risk a war. 
  Along with the U.S. imperialists, the Kim Yong-sam clique is 
also running wild in war exercises to harm fellow countrymen 
putting the entire puppet Army under an around-the-clock alert 
posture. At present, large-scale wild war exercises are being 
jointly conducted by three services of the puppet Army, Navy, 
and Air Force in the sky, on the land, and in the sea of South 
Korea. 
  Apart from this, another military exercise is being 
conducted 
and South Korea is literally turning into an actual combat 
exercise field for northward invasion war exercises. There, the 
day dawns with war exercises and the night falls with war 
exercises. As we can see, the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets are trying to kindle a war on the Korean 
peninsula by all means and their war mania is reaching extremes. 
  Due to the provocative maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists 
and 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for a new war, the situation on 
the Korean peninsula is developing into a phase of a dangerous 
war that could explode any minute. 
  What is making us more outraged is that the puppets are 
describing the provocative northward invasion war exercise as 
contributive to the peaceful settlement of the Korean peninsula. 
They are indeed shameless. 
  War exercises and peace can never be parallel. Peace cannot 
be achieved when war exercises continue. How can one say that 
it is contributive to peace to join outside forces to sharpen 
the sword to harm fellow countrymen and to lead the situation to 
a crisis of a brink of war? The puppets cannot conceal the 
provocative character of the war exercises or their bellicose 
nature by any deceptive talk. 
  The U.S. imperialists and their hunting dog the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique are trying to shake our socialist system with a 
reckless war commotion, but it is as foolish and stupid as 
trying to break a rock with an egg. 
  We want peace, but will never beg for it. We do not want 
war, but will never fear it. If the rascals dare to kindle the 
fire like a puppy not knowing of a tiger's threat, our people 
and People's Army, who have a firm self-reliant national economy 
and strong national defense power, will pay back with 
retaliatory strikes [pobok tagyok] that are thousands and 
hundreds times more severe [hodoen]. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, who are 
stirred up by northward invasion war fever, must clearly know 
that provokers will pay a dear price and must not run recklessly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The ulterior intention 
of the U.S. in declaring nuclear non-proliferation the "basis of 
its state diplomacy" is based on its hegemonistic mode of 
thinking and is aimed at isolating and stifling the DPRK and 
other countries by taking issue with their peaceful nuclear 
activities under the pretext of "preventing nuclear 
proliferation". 
  A spokesman of the DPRK Institute of Disarmament and Peace 
made the remarks in an interview with KCNA today concerning the 
Clinton administration's declaration that nuclear 
non-proliferation is the "basis of its state diplomacy." 
  He told KCNA: 
  The United States developed nuclear weapons before any other 
country and was the first to use them in World War II. With the 
beginning of the cold war between the bipolar blocs, the number 
of the recognised nuclear-weapon states grew to five. 
  Each time agreements on limited abolition of nuclear weapons 
were signed, mankind watched them with hopes for the future of 
nuclear disarmament. However, the status of the nuclear-weapon 
states is still maintained and public concern is growing over 
nuclear arms development in other countries. 
  International studies estimate that most of the Western 
countries have experience in nearly completing the development 
of nuclear weapons after World War II and have material and 
technological foundations to manufacture nuclear weapons without 
much difficulty, once determined. 
  Especially, the development of nuclear weapons in Japan and 
South Korea has gone beyond the limit of international 
apprehension and Israel is known to have produced and possess 
nuclear weapons. 
  The United States and some Western countries suspect that 
certain countries in the Middle East and South Asia, South 
Africa and some countries of South America are engaged in 
nuclear development for military purposes, though the suspected 
countries contend that their nuclear activities are for peaceful 
purposes. 
  With the emergence of nations of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States possessing nuclear weapons after the collapse 
of the Soviet Union in recent years, the problem of nuclear 
weapons involves many more countries worldwide. 
  As seen above, the nuclear problem assumes a very wide and 
complicated international character. Therefore, international 
efforts for nuclear non-proliferation must be directed to 
reducing and abolishing the existing nuclear weapons in keeping 
with the post-cold war trend, and must be concentrated on 
preventing the nuclear activities of those countries that 
actually intend to develop nuclear weapons and have enough 
potentials for this. 
  On the contrary, the United States is continuously promoting 
the modernisation of its own nuclear weapons and conniving at 
the dangerous nuclear gamble of its allies or some other 
countries, while throwing doubt upon the peaceful nuclear 
activities of the DPRK and other countries that go against the 
grain with it and even calling for "sanctions" against them. 
  At the meeting of the disarmament commission of the United 
Nations which ended on May 7, many developing countries charged 
that the nuclear-weapon states had not stopped the production 
and modernisation of nuclear weapons while paying attention only 
to nuclear non-proliferation rather than to nuclear arms 
cutback. On the other hand, the United States and other Western 
countries busied themselves laying stress on strengthening the 
"nuclear non- proliferation system" and enhancing the "role of 
the U.N. Security Council" in such a manner as to increase 
pressure and sanctions. This shows the unfair attitude of the 
United States toward nuclear disarmament. 
  The United States' double standard regarding the nuclear 
issue and its sinister political intention result in concealing 
and encouraging the nuclear ambitions of many countries. 
  While the United States is resorting to a fruitless campaign 
over the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities, the development of 
nuclear weapons in some countries has reached a more dangerous 
line under its shade. This will have a grave irrevocable impact 
on the international nuclear non- proliferation system in the 
future. 
  If the United States renounces its hostile policy toward the 
DPRK and takes the position of respecting its independence and 
carrying out the steps of joint action, the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula will be settled smoothly and equitably. This 
will mean a contribution to international nuclear 
non-proliferation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The members of 
Greenpeace published an appeal on May 3 urging the United States 
to completely withdraw its nuclear weapons and nuclear-equipped 
warships from northeast Asia. 
  Noting that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty [NPT] has 
not 
stopped nuclear proliferation but has become a cause of the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the appeal stressed that the 
signatories to the NPT must not extend the period of its 
validity but ban the nuclear weapons as illegal and place all 
plutonium and other fissionable materials under international 
safeguards for ever. 
  It said that with a view to proceeding to a universal and 
comprehensive disarmament, all the nations must give up nuclear 
weapons and the United States must fully play its role in 
reducing its nuclear arsenal, beginning with the complete 
withdrawal from northeast Asia of its nuclear weapons and 
nuclear-armed and nuclear-capable warships.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) on May 10 
issued an appeal on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the 
Kwangju popular uprising, calling upon the South Korean people 
of various strata to rise in the nationwide struggle for 
anti-U.S. independence, according to Seoul-based radio Voice of 
National Salvation. 
  The Kwangju popular uprising was sparked by the frantic 
repressive offensive the U.S. imperialists and their stooges 
"Yusin" remnants launched after proclaiming the "Emergency 
Martial Law" all over South Korea in May 1980. It was an 
anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance and a death-defying massive 
armed uprising against the fascist suppression. 
  Our people suffered a terrible disaster in Kwangju 14 years 
ago owing to the United States, the appeal says, and continues: 
  Before the grudge of those days vanishes, the cursed United 
States is bringing a horrible nuclear holocaust to our people 
and our nation. 
  The United States is running amuck in putting pressure on 
the 
North even through the United Nations in a bid to open the way 
out for the U.S. war industrial complexes facing marketing 
difficulties with the end of the cold war and to jumpstart the 
sluggish U.S. economy by turning the land of our country into a 
nuclear war theatre and making our nation a sacrifice of a 
nuclear war. 
  Our nation cannot overlook the present grave situation. 
  Our nation must determinedly rise in a struggle to get the 
U.S. troops and nuclear weapons fraught with nuclear holocaust 
withdrawn from South Korea and to smash the U.S. pressure to 
open rice and weapon markets. 
  Let us all put an end to the colonial rule and intervention 
of the U.S. imperialists and retake the sovereignty of the 
nation with the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle. 
  Let us all overthrow Kim Yong-sam, the arch traitor to the 
nation, who has reduced South Korea to a colony and nuclear 
forward base of the United States and is scheming to ignite a 
nuclear war in this land, and realize the sovereignty of the 
nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
recently at a party in "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] 
contended that the reunification of the country is "fantasy" and 
"unification concept must be discarded." 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this as an 
unpardonable separatist remark against reunification. 
  The news analyst says: 
  To reunify the divided country is the supreme desire and the 
most urgent task of the nation. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks denying reunification 
itself are an intolerable insult and challenge to the 70 million 
Koreans who crave for national reunification and fight for its 
realisation. 
  He not only utters words against reunification but also 
works 
hard to block the peaceful reunification of the country. 
  It is none other than the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique that 
categorically opposed the ten-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation, a common reunification charter of the 
nation, turned down the North-proposed convocation of a national 
conference for national reconciliation, unity and reunification, 
frustrated the exchange of special envoys between North and 
South, totally blocked North-South dialogue and drove the 
North-South relations to confrontation and the brink of war. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly see the trend of the 
times, refrain from separatist acts against reunification and 
step down as demanded by the people.

<F P=106> ["They Are Digging Their Own Grave" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ruling 
quarters are trying to install a legal and institutional 
mechanism for overseas aggression which the preceding successive 
cabinets dared not do and to gratify at any cost their desire to 
invade Korea again in reliance on it. 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a press 
conference on May 10 that Japan was examining "emergency 
legislative arrangements" for a counteraction of the 
"self-defence forces [SDF]" to a possible "emergency situation" 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  The "emergency legislative arrangements" examined by the 
present cabinet are aimed at laying a legal foundation for 
sending "SDF" forces to the Korean peninsula any moment and 
paving the way for a legal comeback to Korea. In talking about 
a possible "emergency situation" on the Korean peninsula, they 
want a propaganda effect to build up public opinion favoring 
"emergency legislative arrangements" by fostering the 
consciousness of crisis among the people. 
  Truth to tell, the Japanese reactionaries are watching for a 
chance to invade Korea, having made legal, ideological and 
military preparations. 
  In crying over the "nuclear threat" of the DPRK and 
connecting it with the "security" of Japan, they are trying to 
invent a pretext for reinvasion. 
  If Japan dare embark upon reinvasion, it will be digging its 
own grave.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sang: "The Japanese Reactionaries </F>
Should Not Act Recklessly"] 
  [Text] Recently in Japan, extremely grave military moves 
have cropped up. The Japanese reactionaries are moving its 
fleet close to the Korean peninsula from its port on the Pacific 
Coast. 
  According to foreign reports, the Japanese authorities are 
reportedly moving its naval fleet to Kure Port in the western 
part of Japan from Yokosuka Port on the Pacific Coast. 
Regarding this, officials of the Japan Defense Agency are 
claiming innocence, saying that such a move was taken because of 
overcrowding at Yokosuka Port. Nevertheless, world public 
opinion does not take them at their word. Reporting on this, the 
U.S. paper DEFENSE NEWS exposed that this is aimed at gaining 
easy access on the East Sea of Korea in case of an emergency on 
the Korean peninsula. The U.S. paper's evaluation is by no 
means groundless. 
  Recently, the Japanese Government authorities and military 
class have taken to babbling a lot about the regional security 
of northeast Asia. Accusing us of developing nuclear weapons, 
they are calling for joint measures under the premise of our 
threat to the security of northeast Asia. 
  The Japanese authorities are driveling that the tripartite 
operational system should be set up among the United States, 
Japan, and South Korea at the earliest possible date as a way to 
take joint measures. What is more, they are raising a clamor 
that their armed forces should serve a similar purpose as the 
U.S. Armed Forces stationed in Japan. The transfer of a naval 
fleet to Kure Port in the western part of Japan, which is within 
a stone's throw from the western sector of the Korean peninsula, 
from Yokosuka Port, was a step taken in accordance with this. 
  Such ill-boding movements have been perpetrated in a 
full-fledged manner ever since the U.S. defense secretary 
visited Japan and the puppet South Korean defense minister and 
the director general of the Japan Defense Agency have even gone 
so far as to hatch a plot. We cannot but take a particularly 
serious view of this. 
  The main topics discussed at the confab among the United 
States, Japan, and South Korea were, maintaining the 
international cooperative system against us, and taking joint 
steps against our nuclear development. In particular, during 
the talks between the puppet South Korean defense minister and 
his Japanese counterpart, the two sides agreed on mapping out 
responsible countermeasures [chaegiminnun taeungchaek] while 
babbling about regional security. It goes without saying that 
this reflects the Japanese reactionaries' attempt at another 
invasion. 
  The recent transfer of their naval fleet to Japan's western 
part from Yokosuka Port can be seen as a military step to 
implement their re-invasion attempt. Already, the Japan Defense 
Agency has moved its Self-Defense Armed Forces from northern 
parts of Japan, like Hokkaido, to the western part of Japan, 
which is not far from our Republic. Hence, it has become clear 
to everyone that the Japanese Army Self-Defense Force and its 
Naval Self-Defense Force could be immediately dispatched to 
Korea if a war were to break out on the Korean Peninsula. 
  What needs to be noted seriously is that newly appointed 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa of the Hata cabinet, in a news 
conference, disclosed that several Japanese Government posts are 
closely examining the enactment of an emergency law enabling the 
Self-Defense Forces to handle the situation in the event of a 
contingency on the Korean peninsula. This is tantamount to 
openly revealing their attempt of invasion by saying that they 
would prepare a new legal foundation for the dispatch of their 
armed forces at any time by amending the present law which bans 
the dispatch so as to immediately mobilize its forces in the 
event of contingency. 
  As a matter of fact, the director general of the Defense 
Agency of the Japanese cabinet had once revealed that the 
working preparations for the amendment of the law were almost 
complete. Saying that several Japanese Government posts are 
reviewing the dispatch under such conditions implies that the 
enactment of the law preparing against emergency which has been 
mapped out by the Japanese authorities for a long time is in its 
final stage. 
  The Japanese Dietmen are reportedly discussing the 
protection 
of Japanese residents in South Korea in an emergency. 
Imperialists always come out with excuses that it is for the 
protection of their people, when attacking other country with 
arms. The case in Grenada and Panama are clear proof of this. 
As the U.S. imperialists did in the past, the Japanese 
authorities are trying to jump into a war with preposterous 
excuses in the event that a war breaks out on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  As we can clearly see from the above cases, Japan has 
deployed its naval forces near the Korean peninsula and is 
attempting to complete the legal basis for outside invasion. It 
has even reached the stage where the Diet is discussing ways to 
find excuses for entry into a war. However, the Japanese 
militarists' ambition for overseas expansion would only bring 
about Japan's destruction. This is the lesson that recent 
history has taught. Japan should learn from its past and should 
not act recklessly.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- A 
luncheon party was given in Tokyo Monday in honor of the 
congratulatory group of Korean residents in Japan, which had 
visited the homeland to celebrate April 15, the birthday of the 
great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song. 
  Yi Chin-kyu, first vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon), who headed the group, said in his report: 
  We saw the people of the homeland pushing ahead with the 
socialist construction full of confidence of certain victory and 
revolutionary optimism under the wise guidance of the great 
leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim 
Chong-il. 
  We realised that Chongnyon would always emerge victorious as 
we have the socialist homeland of chuche. 
  He expressed his determination to defend the socialist 
homeland as well as Chongnyon with their lives to the last, 
unshaken by any anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon move, and successfully 
carry out all patriotic tasks facing Chongnyon including the 
struggle to bring into practice the 10-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation.

  [Text] The organization of Korean residents in Russia sent 
a letter of protest to the Japanese Consulate General and the 
puppet Consulate General in Russia condemning the maneuvers of 
the nation-selling, treacherous clique and the Japanese 
reactionaries to lure Korean compatriots residing in Sakhalin 
Oblast into South Korea. 
  The letter of protest revealed and denounced the fact that 
in 
mid-January, the South Korean puppet authorities waged a 
negotiation commotion with the Japanese Government in a bid to 
lure Korean compatriots in Sakhalin into South Korea and kicked 
up a commotion of grasping those who have submitted an 
application for their repatriation to South Korea for permanent 
residence under the name of an on-the-spot, fact-finding team. 
  The letter indicated: The South Korean authorities's attempt 
to settle the issue on the Korean compatriots residing in 
Sakhalin in return for receiving small monetary compensation 
from the criminals in disregard of its political nature is a 
criminal act which cannot be tolerated in light of our nation's 
dignity and interests. This is not only an insult to the 70 
million fellow countrymen and a mockery to the nation, but is 
also a vicious, brigandish act of alienating overseas 
compatriots from the government of the Republic and, 
furthermore, of completely trampling the lofty ideal and dream 
of people who aspire a reunified fatherland and are devoting 
themselves to it. 
  In the name of Korean residents in Russia, the organization 
of Korean compatriots residing in Russia bitterly condemns the 
South Korean authorities' act of attempting to replace the 
nation's dignity and interests with small monetary compensation, 
and brands the act as a shameless political swindle and 
fraudulence to cheat and mock at our compatriots. 
  Noting that, under the mask of humanitarianism, the South 
Korean puppet authorities are hellbent on conducting propaganda 
to cheat the Korean compatriots in Sakhalin because they aim 
heinously to lure them into building an anti-Republic lot in the 
Far East region, and to perpetuate the country's division in 
order to block the struggle of compatriots for national 
reunification by inspiring the consciousness of discord and 
confrontation within the nation, the letter of protest 
continued: The Korean compatriots residing in Russia sternly 
declare its opposition to and rejection of the heinous and 
cunning maneuvers of the South Korean authorities and the 
Japanese authorities to calculate, to the end, all crimes 
committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past, and not to 
tolerate the South Korean authorities' maneuvers to sell out the 
nation's interests and dignity by fluttering and submitting to 
Japan. 
  The South Korean authorities should immediately renounce the 
antinational and antireunification maneuvers of settling the 
issue of Korean compatriots residing in the former Soviet Union 
region and the Sakhalin Oblast with mere monetary compensation 
in collusion with the Japanese Government. 
  The Japanese authorities should apologize before all of the 
Korean people for all the criminal acts that they committed 
against our people in the past, and fully compensate for them 
and should no longer commit acts hindering the independent 
reunification of Korea. 
  The South Korean authorities and the Japanese authorities 
should know that if they continue to commit a rash and reckless 
act without giving heed to the serious warning of the Government 
of the Republic and the 70 millions of fellow countrymen to 
cling to the base plot to move Korean compatriots in Sakhalin to 
South Korea they will not be able to escape the responsibility 
for the crime of having insulted and abused the lofty ideal of 
humanitarianism, will suffer greater disgrace and defeat before 
the world, and will receive the justice of history.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- Political parties and 
organizations of different countries have condemned the United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency for spreading 
the rumour about fictitious "development of nuclear weapons" by 
the DPRK to aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the DPRK said in a statement April 23 that the IAEA manipulated 
by the United States is picking quarrel only with Korea, a 
non-nuclear state, while conniving at the production of nuclear 
arms in other countries. 
  If the U.S. and IAEA truly want global peace, they should 
destroy all nuclear weapons, check the nuclear development of 
Japan and South Korea and stop slandering Korea over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue", the statement said. 
  The Ghanaian National Institute of the Chuche Idea demanded 
in a statement April 10 that the United States discontinue the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises for good and stop at once 
the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea for peace and 
security of the world. 
  The Guyanese National Committee for the Study of the Chuche 
Idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, in a statement April 26, criticized 
the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council for applying, 
under the U.S. patronage, the extremely discriminatory and 
prejudiced double standard to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  The Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, in a protest letter 
addressed to the U.S. President on May 1, branded the stepped-up 
preparations of the United States to resume joint military 
exercises against the DPRK, a socialist state, as an act of 
disturbing global peace, especially peace and security in the 
Korean peninsula. 
  It urged the United States to immediately withdraw its 
nuclear weapons, over 40,000 troops and Patriot missiles from 
South Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Foreign news media 
condemned the United States and its followers for kicking up a 
row of "nuclear suspicion" against Korea. 
  The Syrian paper NIDAL AL SHA'B said the United States has 
schemed to open all facilities of people's Korea through the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and instigated the 
IAEA to put pressure on Korea to bring it to its knees. 
  The paper exposed that the purpose of the row of "nuclear 
suspicion" by Washington that shipped nuclear weapons into the 
Korean peninsula is to make people's Korea kneel down, not to 
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  A Czech paper charged that even after the Democratic 
People's 
Republic of Korea had sincerely implemented the agreed points 
reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York, the United States 
put forth an unreasonable precondition, spreading a rumour that 
North Korea is not only producing nuclear weapons but also 
intending to "attack" South Korea. 
  The act of the United States is a laughing-stock of the 
world, said the paper. 
  The Mozambican magazine TEMPO noted that it is a gross 
violation of the U.N. charter that the United States reversed 
the agreed points of the DPRK-USA contact in New York and 
brought the "nuclear issue" to the United Nations. 
  The magazine stressed that the U.N. Security Council should 
refrain from violating the U.N. charter to follow the lead of 
the United States and the United States should withdraw all its 
Armed Forces of aggression including nuclear weapons from South 
Korea and take a sincere attitude toward the DPRK-USA talks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities must no longer detain Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
old men who had suffered in prison for more than 30 years, but 
unconditionally send them back to the Northern half of Korea 
where their families and relatives are waiting, urged the 
Ghana-DPRK Friendship Association in a letter sent to the South 
Korean Red Cross on April 21 demanding the repatriation of the 
unconverted long-term prisoners, Kim and Ham. 
  The letter expressed regret at the fact that the South 
Korean 
Red Cross was still failing to exert efforts for the two old 
men's repatriation. To meet their demand for repatriation is a 
just and fair behavior in view of humanitarianism and the 
international law, it noted, urging the South Korean Red Cross 
to help so that Kim and Ham may return to the DPRK without delay. 
  The letter strongly demanded that the South Korean 
authorities abrogate the "National Security Law" and set free 
all the prisoners of conscience including unconverted long-term 
prisoners in South Korea.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said 
views from other ministries such as the Commerce Ministry are 
needed to decide on curbs to privileges granted to the United 
States. This will be based on conditions ratified under the GATT 
agreements which stipulate equal treatment for all countries 
that are members of the World Trade Organization. He said that 
governments in the past have solved the problem through the 
liberalization of various kinds of businesses. 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] It is our intention. The 
removal of clauses under the Amity Treaty from the National 
Executive Council Announcement No 281 is due to the fact under 
Announcement No 281, we have to treat every country equally. 
This is because of the agreements of the World Trade 
Organization, as we are a member of the organization, and so is 
the United States. The United States must understand this very 
well, and there should not be any problem. As for the next 
step, we will have to clarify with the United States that in 
future, it won't be the only country that enjoys all those 
special privileges. [End recording]

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said 
yesterday Thailand should consider sector-by-sector whether to 
withdraw or retain rights reserved especially for Americans to 
engage in services and professions normally reserved for Thais. 
  His comment confirms the gathering momentum at the highest 
levels of government to review the 1966 Thai-US Amity Treaty 
which exempts Americans from a number of activities normally 
restricted under the Alien Business Law. 
  The move would be part of Thailand's preparation to 
undertake 
commitments under the new General Agreement on Trade in Services 
(GATS) due to take effect early next year. 
  GATS outlaws discrimination between trading partners in 
service industries. The European Union, Japan, Australia and 
other industrial countries have been urging Thailand to provide 
them with the same rights Americans enjoy under the Thai-US 
treaty. 
  Thai officials are only now starting to consider which 
services should be opened to other nationals and which should 
continue to be reserved for Thais. 
  Under GATS, the restricted service sectors would also have 
to 
be closed to Americans, but Washington is lobbying to keep them 
open. 
  Dr Suphachai said the treaty has been in effect for a long 
time. Considering current conditions, it may be obsolete. 
Therefore, the country should review whether it will continue 
to grant privileges to each sector of the service industry. 
  Paramount to considerations is whether any decision would 
affect national security or contravene Thai traditions. 
  The Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry suggested that the treaty 
not be amended; however, Dr Suphachai said more debate among 
other government agencies, particularly the Commerce Ministry, 
should be entertained. 
  Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said earlier that 
Thailand should amend the treaty to comply with the GATS rules. 
  Dr Suphachai said the country had approved the amendment of 
the Announcement of the National Executive Council No. 281, 
commonly known as the Alien Business Law, which refers to freer 
foreign investment in the same line with "national treatment" 
(that is, treating others as if they were Thai nationals. He 
maintained such rights are already granted to U.S. citizens. 
  The government is planning to liberalize foreign investment, 
particularly in the automobile industry, said Dr Suphachai. 
  Asked whether a law passed by the parliament should 
supersede 
a treaty, Dr Suphachai said that normally a treaty should 
supersede any law. However, specific laws may present conflicts 
which should be carefully reviewed.

<F P=106> [From the "Thai Talk" column by Suthichai Yun: "Trafficking </F>
in Drugs and Uttering Lies"] 
  [Text] The Chuan administration has produced another 
"first" in the country's political annals: This government has 
turned an international drug trafficking case into a partisan 
incident. 
  For some bizarre reason, the prime minister, who, under 
normal circumstances, would be considered the nation's top 
law-enforcement official, has decided to adopt a "hands-off" 
policy in the scandal involving 45 tonnes of Thai marijuana 
shipped from either Thailand or nearby countries to the United 
States between 1973 and 1987 allegedly involving an opposition 
lawmaker from Nakhon Panom province. 
  Strange, incredible and incoherent statements were made by 
all concerned from the very first day this story broke into the 
open here about two weeks ago. Nobody should have been taken 
aback of course when MP Thanong Siriprichaphong denied it all. 
That he backtracked somewhat to admit some of the claims made 
by the U.S. Information Service was only to be expected. 
  It should have come as no surprise, either, that some of the 
leading members of Chat Thai Party came out vehemently to raise 
the specter of a concerted conspiracy to discredit the major 
opposition party. And the allegation may well be valid to a 
certain extent. If the timing of the "leak" was suspect, the 
drug-trafficking episode was a clear case of violation of the 
law -- American and Thai. 
  But the government has mishandled the scandal from the 
outset. The USIS statement made it very clear that the first 
official word of the indictment against this group of Thais was 
relayed to the Thai government in January, 1993. Fifteen months 
later, Government House, the Foreign Ministry and the Office of 
Narcotics Control Board said they had no clues about the case at 
all. Suddenly, the government itself was trapped by its attempt 
to detach itself from a potentially sensitive issue. Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai's initial reaction to reporters' 
questions was one of typical caution and detachment. It was him 
all over again, warning against rushing to conclusions and 
allowing the accused to state his case. 
  Likewise, Thai police were tonguetied. The Foreign Ministry, 
presumably the only official channel through which the U.S. 
Embassy had informed the Thai government about the indictment, 
failed miserably to explain why it had kept quiet for so long. 
The country's top drug enforcement agency under the 
jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, was caught 
offguard, mumbling something bordering on disbelief. Its 
earlier claims about close contacts with Washington's DEA in 
cracking down on drug traffickers suddenly faded into oblivion. 
  While Thanong put on his flip-flop show, his Chat Thai Party 
went through its defensive motion. Banhan Sinlapa-acha, the new 
party boss, has every reason to believe that the whole exercise 
was part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy against his political 
career path. The leak came on the eve of his being elevated to 
the post as party leader -- one year and four months after the 
Thai Foreign Ministry was supposed to have been tipped about the 
court case in San Francisco. 
  That was probably why Premier Chuan quickly turned the case 
into Chat Thai's very own in-house hot potato instead of 
demanding a full-fledged investigation into DEA's claim, whether 
or not the key suspect was a prominent politician in the 
opposition camp. One wonders whether the government would have 
treated this case with the same nonchalance had the same charge 
been slapped on a lawmaker on the side of the government. 
  The House of Representatives may have named a committee to 
look into the charges. The Chat Thai Party, too, has set up its 
own probe team, ostensibly to demonstrate its seriousness in 
salvaging its reputation. 
  But the government has yet to come up with any convincing 
move to underscore the fact that drug trafficking allegations 
are far from a partisan issue best left to political parties 
concerned. It's a national problem which affects the overall 
social and economic fabric -- and the government's political 
credibility in living up to its platform to crack down hard on 
drugs and illicit drugs. 
  Prime Minister Chuan will have to get his people to answer 
some of the obvious questions which have been raised in this 
connection: 
  1. The DEA said it had submitted a official letter on 
Thanong's case in January, 1993. Who in which government agency 
was the recipient of the document? Why has the report been kept 
under wraps all along? Why weren't the prime minister, the 
foreign minister, the interior minister and the anti-narcotics 
agency informed about the request? 
  2. If the relevant agencies were in fact informed about the 
case, why did they insist, on the day the story broke, that they 
were not aware of the incident? If they, in fact, had been told 
about the story but were not ready to give out the truth to the 
public, were they therefore lying to the people? Who were they 
trying to protect? What has happened to accountability of 
public servants in this country? 
  3. Do the law-enforcement agencies plan to take their own 
action, under Thai laws, against those accused by the American 
authorities? Are we, members of the Thai public, being told to 
believe that the various shipments of marijuana destined for the 
United States were in no way related to Thailand -- and that 
they did not constitute offenses under the Thai laws at all? 
  4. Does the five-party coalition government stand ready to 
be accused of politicizing the scandal to save itself from a no- 
confidence motion -- and, in the process, undermining Chat Thai 
leader Banhan's attempts to grill the government? 
  In other words, can the government get away with its 
apparent 
inefficiency and obvious lack of accountability while the 
opposition tries to can this kettle of fish? The answer, plain

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out the 
extradition of Thanong Siriprichaphong to the United States, 
where he is wanted on drugs charges. 
  Chuan said the police or the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB) can take legal action against the Chat Thai MP in 
Thailand if they have sufficient evidence from the United States. 
  Chuan insisted that any action against Thanong, who has been 
accused by the U.S. of conspiring to smuggle more than 45 tones 
of marijuana into the United States, should be in a Thai court 
rather than overseas. 
  A U.S. indictment, revealed on Tuesday, charges Thanong with 
smuggling, conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise between 1973 and 1987. 
  The U.S. Justice Department announced early this week that 
it 
will seek Thanong's extradition under a treaty with Thailand. 
But Thai officials insisted the treaty did not oblige 
extradition of Thais to the U.S. and vice versa. 
  "If police or the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) 
have enough evidence, they can take legal action against 
Thanong," Chuan said. "They can request evidence from the U.S.." 
  Chuan said investigators must have sufficient evidence 
before 
taking criminal cases into court. 
  "The government's duty is to ensure justice prevails in our 
society. Any allegations against Thais should be tried in a 
Thai court," he said. 
  The government was also willing to comply with a Chat Thai 
request to provide a party fact-finding committee with all 
information relating to the charges against Thanong. 
  Other senior government MPs yesterday were also insisting 
that any action against Thanong should be in Thailand. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "We will 
never send Thai people to stand trial in a foreign country. We 
will take legal action against a culprit according to evidence 
we have and under Thai law." 
  He said the Foreign Ministry was in contact with the U.S. 
authorities and was seeking more details of the evidence against 
Thanong. 
  Aphisit believed Chat Thai's fact-finding committee would be 
neutral and take action against Thanong according to the 
evidence placed before it. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, who oversees the ONCB, 
said the agency had a policy of cooperating fully with the U.S. 
in tracking down drug trafficking activities. It would not 
protect Thanong if there was evidence against him. 
  Amnuai would not commit himself on the issue of Thanong's 
extradition to the U.S. but said Thailand had a discretionary 
right to prosecute its own citizens. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said Thanong would be 
immediately prosecuted in Thailand if police had sufficient 
evidence. 
  "Police are waiting for more evidence from the U.S. 
  "If they get enough evidence to substantiate the charges 
against Thanong, the prosecution will proceed," he said. 
  Parliament President Marut Bunnak said that in practice 
Thailand would not allow the extradition of its citizens to 
stand trial in a foreign country. 
  The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, has offered to help make 
possible a visit to the United States by Thanong. 
  The embassy also announced that it "is working closely with 
the (Thai) Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue, and is 
providing a complete text of the indictment to the ministry". 
  Thanong has denied the U.S. charges and announced his 
willingness to travel to the US, if necessary, to defend himself.

  [Text] A source at the Export Promotion Department told 
PRACHACHAT THURAKIT that the PRC Government has taken action to 
punish Chinese textile and garment factories which made a false 
declaration concerning country of origin of their products in 
order to circumvent U.S. quotas for textile and garment imports. 
According to the latest report sent to the department, one of 
the four penalized companies used Thailand for its false 
declaration of the country of origin of the products. 
  A report was sent to the Export Promotion Department by 
Kunyaphan Raengkham, director of the Thai Trade Center in Los 
Angeles. It details penalties meted out to four Chinese 
manufacturers and exporters which falsified the country of 
origin by labelling the products as goods made in Fiji and 
Thailand. The four Chinese companies penalized are: the Shakou 
Branch Company of Dongmao Industries in Shenyang, the Guangyu 
Xiamen Company in Fujian, the Shifa Garment Company in Canton, 
and the Yongjia Garment Company in Canton. 
  Chinese authorities indicated that the Shakou Company had 
contracts with a company in Hong Kong to sell blue jeans to 
Singapore under the false label 'Made in Fiji.' From Singapore, 
the products were shipped to the United States. The Guangyu 
Xiamen Company was arrested by Chinese Customs authorities for 
attempting to smuggle out towels for export to the United 
States, with the towels bearing a 'Made in Thailand' label. 
  The Guangyu Xiamen Company was fined by the Chinese 
Government at 20 percent of the total cost of exports, and its 
export permission was suspended for two years. As for the 
Shakou Company, the Chinese authorities seized all its profits 
and banned exports by the company until 1995. This was the 
fourth time in April that Chinese authorities took action 
against companies for falsifying the declaration of the country 
of origin on their products in order to smuggle goods to the 
United States. 
  The Chinese Government arrests and fines such Chinese 
garment 
factories for circumventing U.S. import quotas under direct 
pressure from the U.S. Government. The United States estimates 
that losses caused by smuggling of textile and garment exports 
from China through false declaration of the country of origin 
amounts to U.S. $2,000 billion annually.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Thai troops stopped about 100 
terrified Cambodian civilians from crossing the Thai-Cambodian 
border on Tuesday. 
  The Khmers were seeking temporary refuge in Thailand due to 
fighting in Cambodia between government troops and Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas. 
  At least two Cambodian civilians were injured when four 
mortar shells, fired by the guerrillas, landed about one 
kilometer from a market in Poipet border town. 
  The fighting prompted some 100 Cambodians to attempt to 
cross 
Mahot canal which demarcates the border. However, they were 
stopped by troops from the Burapha Task Force.

police said. 
  One of the illegal Chinese immigrants, who were aged between 
17 and 38 and all from Fujian Province, has told police he

  Maritime Safety Agency investigators arrested the 47 Chinese 
remaining aboard the freighter off Shimane Prefecture on 
suspicion of sneaking into Japan illegally, thus bringing the 
number of foreigners apprehended in the case to 61. 
  On Thursday, 14 out of 94 people aboard the ship were 
arrested for allegedly violating Japan's Immigration Control Law 
after a fishing boat discovered the vessel entangled in a fixed 
fishing net in the Sea of Japan, 4 kilometers off the town of 
Taki, Shimane Prefecture, on the coast of the Sea of Japan early 
the same day. 
  Thirty-three people, who had gone ashore, are still missing,

  A 46-year-old Indonesian man who claimed to be the captain 
said the ship left Hong Kong on April 20 and later took 81 
Chinese on board the vessel while standing offshore, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- A group of four Chinese 
naval vessels are approaching seas off Japan on their way to pay 
a goodwill visit to the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, 
Defense Agency sources said Friday [13 May]. 
  The sources said the ships, including a destroyer and a 
frigate, are expected to pass through the Tsushima Straits into 
the Sea of Japan early Saturday. 
  It is believed to be the first time in the postwar period 
for 
Chinese naval ships to enter the Sea of Japan. 
  Russia's ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported earlier this month 
that three Chinese Navy ships, led by Chinese Northern Fleet 
Commander Wang Jing and including the destroyer Zhuhai, escort 
ship Huainan and rescue ship Anxindao, will arrive in 
Vladivostok on May 17. 
  The sources said Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) P-3C 
aircraft spotted a 3,250-ton Luda-class destroyer, a supply 
ship, and a submarine support and rescue ship. 
  Also sighted by the MSDF, but not mentioned in the report, 
was a 2,250-ton frigate equipped with antiaircraft missiles. 
  The ships are returning a visit paid to the Chinese port 
city 
of Qingdao last August by a group of three Russian Navy ships.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The Chinese Government is 
moving to introduce a voluntary curb on textile exports to 
Japan, a Japanese trade ministry source said Friday [13 May]. 
  The step is designed to prevent Japan from invoking a 
discriminatory curb on textile imports from China, a protective 
measure allowed under the Multifiber Agreement (MFA), the source 
at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said. 
  The source said Beijing sent MITI a letter stating it 
supported the voluntary textile export cap. The letter was sent 
when Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary, was a MITI chief. 
  The MFA, which took effect in 1974, is intended to protect 
Japan and other Western industrial countries, major textile 
importers, from possible damage to their domestic textile 
industries due to massive textile exports by China and other 
developing nations. 
  The recently concluded Uruguay Round accord on global trade 
calls for a phased removal of managed trade practices, such as 
voluntary export restraints. 
  In line with the global trade policy, Tokyo announced 
earlier 
this year that it will scrap a voluntary curb on U.S.-bound car 
exports starting this year.

  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, May 13 KYODO -- The latest group 
of Japanese to make a visa-free visit to the Russian-held 
islands off Hokkaido's eastern tip returned Friday [13 May] 
after two nights on Kunashiri Island. 
  Entering the third year of the visa-free exchanges, the 48 
Japanese, led by Jun Katagi, head of the prefectural 
government's general affairs office, was the first group of the 
year to travel to the disputed islands. A Russian group visited 
Hokkaido in April. 
  The group departed Wednesday and arrived in Furukamappu, 
Kunashiri, and spent the evening with island residents. 
  The group visited an elementary school and a museum Thursday 
and in the evening took part in a discussion meeting with 
island's residents and were hosted to a dinner party. 
  Before this visit, the Russians had asked the Japanese 
charter vessel to fly the Russian flag alongside the Japanese 
flag and to use the name "Russia" in filling out arrival 
documents. 
  The visitors complied with the requests, but the 
negotiations 
delayed the arrival by an hour and 30 minutes. 
  A second group of 48 is scheduled to leave for Etorofu 
Island 
on Saturday. 
  The two islands along with Shikotan Island and the Habomai 
group of islets were taken over by the Soviet Red Army at the 
end of World War II, but Japan has continued to claim 
sovereignty over what it terms the "northern territories." The 
island dispute has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from ever 
concluding a peace treaty.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa on Friday [13 May] sought the cooperation of his 
cabinet colleagues to meet strong U.S. and European Union 
demands for Japan's greater deregulation efforts in "visible" 
form, officials said. He made the request at the first meeting 
of ministers concerned with deregulation. 
  The United States and EU are asking for the removal or 
relaxation of seven types of government regulations, including 
those concerning the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law and the 
management of public and private pension funds. Their demands 
also include more relaxed building standards and electrical 
goods standards to promote the international harmonization of 
standards. 
  The ministers are expected to meet again early next week as 
some ministers such as construction minister were not present at 
the first meeting, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and select cabinet ministers on Friday agreed on the need to 
come up with powerful measures by the end of June to promote 
deregulation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. At 
a ministerial meeting on government regulation plans, Hata said 
drawing up effective deregulatory measures is a mission of his 
administration, the top government spokesman told a news 
conference. 
  The premier and the ministers also concurred on the need for 
each cabinet minister to take the lead on relaxing economically 
restrictive government regulations in the face of resistance 
from government ministries and agencies, Kumagai said. 
  Friday's meeting drew Hata, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Management and Coordination 
Agency Chief Koshiro Ishida, Economic Planning Agency Head 
Yoshio Terasawa and Kumagai. 
  Kumagai said the cabinet will convene a second ministerial 
get-together on deregulation possibly next week by inviting 
heads of ministries and agencies holding control over a number 
of regulations. The government has vowed to come up with 
full-scale deregulatory measures by the end of June as part of 
efforts to spur domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite 
for imports. 
  The cabinet meeting came at a time when the government's 
administrative reform headquarters is striving to seek specific 
deregulation measures at its three working groups. Earlier 
Friday, a business leader urged Hata to relax various government 
regulations on real estate trading and 
telecommunications-related industries. 
  Isao Nakauchi, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), called on Hata at the premier's 
official residence and made the pitch. Nakauchi told reporters 
he informed Hata of his dissatisfaction with the government's 
working groups on deregulation, saying their talks have been 
dominated by bureaucrats and that opinions of the private sector 
have not been well reflected. 
  Hata reportedly told Nakauchi, who is also chairman and 
president of Daiei Inc., a major supermarket chain, that he 
hopes to promote deregulation through the initiatives of his 
cabinet rather than the bureaucracy. 
  In the morning, Keidanren submitted to Kumagai a letter 
urging the government to promote deregulation. Kumagai told his 
news conference that the working groups will bear sufficient 
fruit in their efforts to seek effective measures to ease 
regulations. "We must work to comply with requests from both at 
home and abroad, or what you might call real demands," the chief 
cabinet secretary said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Information and 
communications experts urged drastic deregulation of the 
telecommunications industry Friday [13 May], government 
officials said. 
  Participants in a meeting of a working group on government 
administrative reform which convened at the prime minister's 
official residence noted the profound change in information and 
communications, saying, "drastic deregulation is necessary, not 
administrative measures in small dollops," the officials said. 
The telecom industry is hampered by existing regulations from 
freely taking the initiative in business, they said. 
  They criticized the measures taken so far by the Postal 
Ministry, saying that deregulation "must be clear-cut to both 
users and the industry." 
  The working group, which met for the sixth time, will draw 
up 
a final report at the next meeting on May 27, the officials 
said. The government will take the report into account when 
drawing up specific deregulation policies before the end of June.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japan should relax excessive 
regulations, including one that limits driving licenses for 
large motorcycles, to remove import barriers, a government body 
handling trade complaints said Friday [13 May]. 
  The Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman urged government 
ministries to ease 21 irksome regulations listed in a report 
submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The report comes 
against the backdrop of mounting criticism that Japan's rigid 
regulations shut out foreign products. 
  U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. has complained 
about "an almost impossible driving license test" for 
motorcycles with an engine displacement over 400 cc. In a 
complaint filed with the office by the U.S. Embassy, 
Harley-Davidson said the system effectively blocks imports of 
foreign motorcycles, almost all of which have larger engines. 
  Two years ago Japan's four major motorcycle makers appealed 
for eased regulations on large bikes and the rigid examination, 
but no change has been made. 
  As requested by Harley-Davidson, the report also recommends 
the government review its ban on tandem riding on highways and 
change the highway speed limit for motorcycles to 100 kilometers 
per hour from 80 kilometers per hour in line with that for 
automobiles. The report also urges flexible enforcement of 
rules on issuing a model certificate by accepting widely 
acknowledged foreign inspection and safety standards. 
  It also said the time required for obtaining import 
permission for cosmetics and perfume should be shortened from 
three to six months. 
  Other rules cited in the report include: 
  Regulations on foodstuff, health care and medical goods 
  -- Standards on condensed grapefruit juice. 
  -- The prevention system for plant epidemics. 
  -- Inspection rules on dairy products. 
  Regulations on industrial goods 
  -- Standards on labeling for textile products. 
  -- The licensing system for automatic nail driving 
machines run on internal gas combustion. 
  -- Rules on electric wheelchairs. 
  Regulations on transport 
  -- Safety standards and inspection rules on automobiles 
and auto parts. 
  -- Regulations on batteries used in electric cars. 
  Regulations on construction 
  -- Rules on fire-resistance tests. 
  -- Standards on wallpaper.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- A Japanese business leader 
urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [13 May] to relax 
various government regulations on real estate trading and 
telecommunications-related industries, business federation 
officials said. 
  Isao Nakauchi, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), paid a visit to Hata's residence for 
the first time since the premier formed his cabinet in late 
April. 
  Hata told Nakauchi, who is also chairman and president of 
Daiei Inc., the supermarket chain, that he hopes to promote 
deregulation through the initiatives of his cabinet rather than 
the bureaucracy. 
  Earlier in the day, executive members of Keidanren took part 
in an administration reform promotion meeting, chaired by 
Nakauchi. The meeting was attended by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  In the meeting, Keidanren submitted to Kumagai a letter 
urging the government to promote deregulation. 
  Kumagai said Hata's administration will make efforts to 
carry 
out deregulation from the viewpoint of improving consumers' 
daily life. 
  Hata's cabinet held its first meeting on government 
deregulation plans on the day, government sources said. The 
meeting was held to promote easing regulations, which have been 
cited by the United States as trade barriers, they said. 
  The cabinet wants to take the initiative on easing 
regulations as ministries and agencies concerned have been 
dragging their feet on the issue, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 (CNA) -- Former Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano paid a call on Lin Chin-ching, representative of 
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan, 
at Lin's office Friday [13 May] to apologize for his recent 
remark that the 1937 "Rape of Nanking" was a "fabrication." 
  He expressed his deep remorse over any trouble the remark 
may 
have caused to Taiwan-Japan relations. 
  The 71-year-old upper house member was forced to resign from 
the new Japanese cabinet last week after the MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
quoted him as saying the "rape of Nanking was a fabrication" and 
that the Pacific war "was not an error." His remarks prompted 
severe criticism at home and abroad. 
  In the meeting with Nagano, Lin expressed the hope that for 
the the good of Sino-Japanese relations, all Japanese should be 
taught the truth of Japan's militaristic expansion into Asia 
before World War II. 
  Nagano, who once served as chief of staff of the Japan 
Ground 
Self-Defense Force, has been a member of the upper house for two 
terms.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- School textbooks will pay 
more attention to moves among foreigners demanding compensation 
for Japan's aggression and use of thousands of "comfort women" 
in frontline brothels during World War II, Education Ministry 
officials said Friday [13 May]. 
  The officials said the ministry screened textbooks for 
fiscal 
1995 to be used at senior high schools so as to reflect its view 
that there is room for considering compensation problems. 
  A growing number of people, including women who say they 
were 
forced to become "comfort women," have filed a series of suits 
against the Japanese Government, seeking compensation for 
damages inflicted during the war. 
  Many of the textbooks which mentioned the compensation issue 
in more detail than in the past passed the ministry's screening 
and will be used by students starting next fiscal year, the 
officials said. 
  The ministry's move reflects the government's earlier 
statement that problems among states were settled legally after 
the war, but it "reserves the right to treat the women's claims 
on an individual basis," a government source said. 
  Then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks last August 
that Japan waged a "war of aggression" against its Asian 
neighbors also seems to have had an influence in the ministry's 
stance on the issue, government sources said. 
  One publisher shows a list of contents of compensation 
demands from war victims in South Korea, Indonesia and the 
Philippines, and the Japanese Government's reaction toward each 
of the suits. 
  Another textbook said there could be problems in the future 
if individuals seeking compensation for war damages are ignored 
on the basis that the issue was settled after the war. 
  One author said he was surprised that the ministry did not 
ask him to cut out or rewrite notes on the compensation issue in 
his textbook. 
  The issues of compensation and "comfort women" are only 
mentioned as facts in some of the textbooks that are currently 
being used for fiscal 1994, which started last month.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The world in 1993 continued 
to head toward an unsteady and unpredictable direction with no 
effective solutions for nagging problems but there were also 
hopeful signs for the future, the Foreign Ministry said in an 
annual report released Friday [13 May]. 
  The ministry's diplomatic bluebook for 1993 said the 
international community was unable to find effective measures to 
solve sluggish economic conditions among industrialized nations, 
regional conflicts such as those in the former Yugoslavia or 
North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons development. 
  Steps to end proliferation of mass destructive weapons or to 
solve turmoil in the former Soviet Union were also unavailable, 
the report said. 
  But bright prospects also appeared as a result of 
international cooperation on a new framework for peace and 
prosperity, it said. 
  The report cited encouraging developments such as the birth 
of a new Cambodia, the historic agreement between the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel and the successful 
conclusion of the seven-year-long Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade talks. 
  Seeking solutions to international problems through 
multilateral means is becoming increasingly important in the 
post-Cold War era since economic, environmental and nuclear 
nonproliferation issues are often intertwined, the paper said. 
  It cited the need to strengthen the functions of the United 
Nations and the importance of cooperation among Japan, the 
United States and Europe which share common values of democracy 
and market- oriented economies and whose combined gross national 
product accounts for 70 percent of the world's GNP. 
  Japan, for its part, should carry out, in cooperation with 
other countries, diplomacy that is both "active and creative" to 
build a new international framework because it now has great 
influence not only economically but also in the political and 
global fields, it said. 
  The report also said Japan also has an increasingly 
important 
role as an industrialized and democratic nation in Asia to 
promote democracy and market-oriented economies worldwide while 
preventing religious and ethnic conflicts. 
  While conceding that in some ways the Japanese people are 
not 
yet fully aware of mounting international expectations toward 
their country, the blue book said notions are taking root that 
Japan should contribute more actively to ensuring peace and 
prosperity in the world while at the same time not seeking to 
become a military superpower. 
  Japan's cooperation during the Persian Gulf crisis and 
participation in the UN-led peacekeeping operations in Cambodia 
helped develop that attitude, it said. 
  Japan also intends to continue efforts to improve its 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing nations in 
quantity and quality because the ODA is an important method to 
fulfill its international responsibility and roles, the report 
said. 
  Regarding its relations with the U.S., the blue book said 
the 
two nations reconfirmed the importance of bilateral ties as new 
governments emerged on both sides of the Pacific. 
  It predicted, however, that disputes between Tokyo and 
Washington may intensify over trade and economic problems as a 
result of the failed bilateral trade framework talks in February. 
  Despite the two governments' agreement that the collapse 
should not affect bilateral cooperation on political, security 
and global aspects, voices of concern and dissatisfaction toward 
each other can be heard in both nations, it said. 
  Efforts by both sides are essential to improve bilateral 
trade relations, but in Japan's case, it should make efforts to 
boost domestic demand while voluntarily taking measures to ease 
access of foreign goods, the report said. 
  The year 1993 also saw active moves regarding regional 
cooperation and regional unification, such as the start of the 
EU, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the holding 
of an informal summit meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations, the report said. 
  But such regional cooperation should be in line with the 
activities of the UN and the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), it said. 
  On the global economy, the blue book cited the need to work 
on serious global unemployment while tackling new problems such 
as improving the compatibility between trade and the environment.

seat, former Japanese Ambassador to the United Nations Yoshio 
Hatano said Friday [13 May]. Hatano, who just completed his 
four-year term in New York, referred to the need to become a 
permanent member in a speech sponsored by the Asian Affairs 
Research Council at a Tokyo hotel. 
  Views in Japan that it would seek the permanent membership 
only if pushed by others or that it should seek the bid modestly 
without looking too eager, are based on a very Japanese way of 
thinking, Hatano said. 
  Because permanent members are elected, Japan must first make 
clear its candidacy and lobby to win votes to gain other 
nations' support, he said. 
  Unless it takes such initiative, Hatano said, no country 
would strongly push for Japan's permanent seat since the 
discussion on whether to include Japan and Germany in the 
Security Council is just one of the agendas to reform the 
council. 
  Hatano also said Japan should not just offer large financial 
contributions to the world body but should speak out and offer 
ideas. 
  Japan currently shoulders 12.45 percent of the two-year U.N. 
budget, ranking second after the United States which provides 25 
percent. From the 1995-1997 U.N. budget, however, its share is 
to rise to 15 percent following a routine rate revision. 
  Despite having limitations in cooperating in U.N. 
activities, 
such as constitutional limits to join U.N. peacekeeping 
operations, Japan does not have to be too timid, Hatano said, 
because the U.N. expects Japan to do what it can within its 
limits. 
  U.N. expectations toward Japan concerning the peacekeeping 
activities are in the field of logistical support and 
engineering, he said. 
  Hatano, however, said Japan, which successfully participated 
in U.N.-led peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, is often 
criticized for being reluctant to join peacekeeping operations 
in other parts of the world except Asia, such as those in Africa. 
  Japan has great shackles on itself regarding participation 
in 
peacekeeping operations because it cannot accept the idea of 
sending Self-Defense Forces troops to dangerous areas, he said. 
  Hatano also said Japan can take initiatives in solving 
environmental problems because "such problems can be solved by 
money." 
  "Japan can take initiatives in things that could be solved 
by 
money. But not in other areas," he said.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Parliamentary forces 
opposed to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata are poised to step up 
next week their attacks on his minority coalition cabinet, which 
was inaugurated only in late April. 
  "Operation Besiege" against the Hata Government was kicked 
off by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday [13 May] 
when it submitted a resolution demanding the chairman of the 
House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee be sacked. The 
resolution against Keiwa Okuda, a member of the coalition's core 
party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] which Hata leads, is 
virtually certain to be approved at a lower house plenary 
session Tuesday because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
supports the idea. 
  The LDP demanded Okuda's dismissal because the coalition 
rejected its call for a change in the chairmanship. The LDP and 
the SDP -- the biggest and second largest opposition parties, 
respectively -- have a combined majority in the 511-member lower 
chamber. 
  The Diet action will be taken at a time when speculation is 
mounting that hata will be forced to resign with all his cabinet 
members or dissolve the lower house for a snap general election 
after the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 has been cleared 
through the Diet as early as June. 
  Hata will be given another headache next week as his 
predecessor in the premiership and major coalition partner 
Morihiro Hosokawa might be forced to give up the post of head of 
the Japan New Party (JNP). 
  The JNP is on the verge of another split because more than 
half its members favor disbanding the 130-member joint 
parliamentary group Kaishin (Innovation) in the lower house. 
The setting up of Kaishin triggered the SDP's withdrawal from 
the coalition. 
  The group was formed mainly by Shinseito, Komeito, the JNP 
and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), excluding the SDP, 
after Hata was named new prime minister at the Diet in April. 
  Three legislators have since quit the JNP and joined new 
party Sakigake [Harbinger] in a unified 18-member lower house 
group. 
  The JNP is scheduled to call a meeting of its national 
delegates Saturday next week to discuss Hosokawa's political 
fate and the party's future political course. Political sources 
said if Hosokawa leaves the post, the party will withdraw from 
Kaishin, accelerating further realignment moves in Japan's 
political community. 
  The LDP and the SDP this week agreed to cooperate with each 
other against what they termed as the coalition's high-handed 
management of state affairs -- a reference to the way coalition 
main strategist Ichiro Ozawa is running the show behind the 
scenes. 
  Their alliance could drive the Hata administration into a 
tight political corner with a no-confidence motion against it, 
for instance. 
  The SDP and Sakigake, an LDP splinter group, this week also 
agreed to bolster their parliamentary cooperation by exploring 
prospects for a future coalition. 
  In an attempt to get out of the corner, Hata will meet 
separately with Yohei Kono, the LDP president, and Tomiichi 
Murayama, SDP chairman -- probably Tuesday. 
  The LDP was in uninterrupted power for 38 years until last 
August when it was toppled by the coalition of Hosokawa. The 
SDP was the coalition's biggest party before its withdrawal. 
  In a parliamentary interpellation this week, Kono questioned 
the authority of Hata's minority government and expressed his 
party's readiness to take over power from it. 
  Kono made the statement in reaction to Hata's appeal to 
opposition parties in his first policy speech to cooperate to 
help his fragile government steer Japan through difficult times 
on the domestic and international fronts. 
  Hata is also likely to meet Masayoshi Takemura, leader of 
Sakigake, a small grouping which was also a Hosokawa coalition 
member but which stayed out of the Hata administration. 
  Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa 
government, 
said this week there will be a change of power after enactment 
of the fiscal 1994 budget, indicating the Hata administration 
will be short-lived. The Hata government is not in good shape 
and is merely an administration to take charge of "certain 
things" for a "certain period," Takemura told a public meeting 
in front of Tokyo's Shimbashi Station on Thursday. 
  "A fire before the wind" is how one political commentator 
described the fate of the Hata government in the weeks to come.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Friday [13 May] reiterated his readiness for a dialogue with 
opposition parties as their attack on his minority government 
continued in the Diet. Admitting the difficulty in handling a 
variety of issues with only minority support, Hata said at a 
plenary session of the House of Councilors that he will seek 
cooperation from the opposition parties. 
  Hata's response to the questions by Takushi Hirai, a member 
of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, 
were for the most part repetitions of his remarks on Thursday in 
the House of Representatives. 
  Hirai pointed to the shaky standing of Hata's minority 
government and made a renewed call for the prime minister to 
step down. 
  Hata said he will respect an agreement among the coalition 
partners on key issues in April, before the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), the second largest opposition, stormed out of the 
coalition. 
  The premier said he will seek cooperation from the SDP in 
line with the platform and will also "consult frankly with the 
LDP" in coping with the pending tasks. 
  The SDP walked out of the ruling coalition immediately after 
it helped put Hata in office over moves among some coalition 
components to form a new Diet bloc, excluding the SDP. 
  Hata also reiterated that the government will make efforts 
to 
pass the proposed tax reform through the Diet by the end of the 
year after compiling the draft bills in June. 
  On the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
program, 
Hata said the government will cope with any emergency, if one 
should occur, with solid unity, while stressing the importance 
of solving the issue through diplomatic efforts. 
  Hata, commenting on Japan's bid for permanent membership of 
the UN Security Council, suggested that Japan is seeking the 
permanent membership with veto power, like the current five 
permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the 
United States. 
  Germany also has said it is interested in joining the 
council 
as a permanent member with veto power.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The primary opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a resolution Friday [13 
May] demanding the dismissal of the chairman of the House of 
Representatives Steering Committee, the crucial committee that 
handles Diet affairs. 
  The Steering Committee's executive members immediately held 
a 
meeting and decided to hold a vote-taking plenary session of the 
lower house next Tuesday on the resolution, political sources 
said. 
  The dismissal of Keiwa Okuda, the committee chairman and a 
member of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party) led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, is virtually certain 
because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is expected to vote 
for the resolution, the sources said. The SDP is the second 
largest opposition party. 
  It also appears certain that Okuda's successor will be 
picked 
from the LDP, they said. The LDP and the SDP have a combined 
majority in the 511-member lower house. 
  "The base on which the current cabinet stands has definitely 
altered, the proportion of power of ruling and opposition 
parties is reversed. There are no longer any grounds to select 
(the chairman) from the ruling parties," the resolution said. 
  In response, Hata criticized the LDP, saying Okuda has been 
giving consideration to the opposition camp. "It (the 
resolution) is nothing but tyranny by force of number," he said. 
  Since Hata was forced to inaugurate his administration on a 
minority base last month after the SDP left the coalition, the 
LDP, which was ousted from its decades-long dominance last 
August, has demanded comprehensive changes in the chairmanships 
of the lower chamber's 20 standing committees. 
  The chairmanship of the Diet Steering Committee, which 
handles a no-confidence resolution against the cabinet if it is 
submitted, is a key post for the LDP as a step toward managing 
Diet affairs. 
  Political sources speculated that the LDP will put forth a 
no- confidence resolution against the Hata cabinet possibly in 
June, after the Diet passes the state budget for fiscal 1994, 
which started on April 1. 
  At a meeting of the Steering Committee's executive members 
in 
the morning, the LDP demanded that ruling parties surrender the 
chairmanships of other lower house committees to the opposition 
camp, political sources said. 
  The chairman posts demanded by the opposition are those for 
the lower house Cabinet Committee, the Commerce and Industry 
Committee and the Transport Committee, all of which were vacated 
when the previous chairmen became ministers in the Hata 
administration, the sources said. 
  The ruling and opposition camps agreed to discuss the other 
posts next Tuesday, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The United States may 
tolerate the early demise of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata if he 
fails to come up with a reasonable plan for the promised full 
tax reform, the advisory panel chief said Friday [13 May]. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton "will think that Hata is hopeless," Kan 
Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a scheduled news 
conference after a panel meeting. 
  Regardless of the political situation, the advisory panel to 
the prime minister will "definitely" issue its report in June 
before the Naples summit of Group of Seven (G-7) major 
industrial nations in July, Kato said, stressing that a detailed 
tax reform plan has become an international commitment. 
  Japan vowed in its March market-opening package to make a 
decision on tax reform, including permanent tax cuts, by July 
and to turn it into law by the end of the year, in reaction to 
U.S. criticism that 6 trillion yen in tax cuts limited to the 
current fiscal year is insufficient to boost domestic demand and 
thus help curb persistent trade surpluses. 
  Kato also said that if Hata wants a long-lasting rule, he 
should present concrete plans for administrative reform to win 
public support for the tax reform which is to include a heavier 
burden on taxpayers through offsetting tax hikes. 
  "Even if a cabinet holds a minority of seats in the Diet, no 
party will try to pull down a prime minister that has strong 
public support," Kato said. 
  He noted that in its June report the panel intends to call 
on 
the government to pave the way for tax reform, particularly 
citing spending cuts, deregulation to spur market activity, and 
other administrative changes. "The government should stop just 
saying that it will conduct administrative reform without 
showing concrete plans," Kato said, noting that only one-third 
or one-fourth of past initiatives have been implemented so far. 
  The panel wants to show the direction for cutting and hiking 
taxes as well as to revamp the current consumption tax system 
for a more efficient taxation, the chairman said. But he noted 
he is still not sure whether concrete figures will be included. 
  Kato said earlier that the report will cover various options 
for politicians to decide on later, and added at the Friday 
press meeting that it will be an interim report, with a final 
report to be issued at the end of the year for fiscal 1996 tax 
revision.

<F P=106> ['News Focus' by Keiji Urakami: "Multimedia Tests To Hasten </F>
New Technology Era"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Both the government and the 
private sector are preparing to launch full-fledged experiments 
on multimedia across the nation from this summer in a move that 
will quicken the advent of the multimedia society in Japan. 
  The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), major backers of multimedia 
projects, say they are inundated with various inquiries from 
businesses aiming to tap an area with huge growth potential 
toward the next century. 
  "We are groping for ways to make multimedia services 
commercial," said Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, which 
recently outlined three types of experiments on the joint use of 
multimedia networks. 
  Test operations of high-speed, wide-band "backbone" telecom 
networks will begin in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and seven other 
major cities across the nation from September, using a 
technology called the asynchronous transfer mode for the first 
time in the world. 
  The idea is to build high-speed local area networks, a 
large- 
amount file transmission system and a high-speed data retrieval 
system, an NTT official said. 
  A test of multimedia networking for general public use will 
be conducted in the 10 cities from the spring of 1995 to 
establish systems for high-grade electronic mail services and 
electronic newspaper. 
  NTT also plans to conduct an experiment on cable television 
services in seven urban areas from the spring of 1995, 
envisaging video-on-demand services that enable viewers to 
access movies and other video programs at their discretion. 
  Interested third parties will be invited to take part in 
each 
experiment, the NTT official said. 
  "By speeding up these experiments, we should lay a 
foundation 
that will lead to actual business opportunities," NTT president 
Kojima said. 
  The Electronic Industries Association of Japan forecast the 
market for multimedia-type hardware and software will grow to 
17.66 trillion yen by 2015, a 4.6-fold jump from 1992. 
  Including infrastructure-related business, the sum will be 
123 trillion yen, the posts ministry predicted. 
  A foundation set up by the posts ministry unveiled a 5 
billion yen experimental project earlier this year to build a 
next- generation telecommunications network in Japan. 
  The project will offer a variety of information and 
communications services, such as teleconferences, visual phones 
and video-on-demand services, for three years from this summer 
in an area in Kyoto, choosing 300 households as model users. 
  "The experiment is intended to clarify economic feasibility 
and other problems involved in laying a nationwide optical-fiber 
network in the 21st century," said the foundation, called the 
Association for Promotion of New Generation Network Services. 
  Remote-control services in medical areas that use integrated 
services digital network (ISDN) technology will be tested by a 
government-private joint entity from this summer in Osaka and 
other kansai areas. 
  Nikon Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and several other companies are 
researching, for example, ways of transmitting X-ray images 
taken at home to remote medical facilities, jointly with Kyoto 
University and Osaka University, said the Association of 
Broadband-ISDN Business Chance and Culture Creation. 
  Remote services under study by the association also include 
mail- order services using electronic catalogs, housing designs 
made by remote-operated computer graphics and remote editing and 
printing of books. 
  The city of Okazaki in Aichi Prefecture has been designated 
by the posts ministry as Japan's first model city for 
experiments of a multimedia network offering education and other 
public services. 
  Using the existing cable-TV network, students at selected 
schools will be able to access from this fall a vast amount of 
educational information collected by the city in the past 40 
years, a spokesman in Okazaki said. 
  "Major school events like a student board meeting may be 
conducted via a teleconference system in the future," said the 
spokesman. 
  Analysts say the social infrastructure needs to be upgraded 
more in Japan for these multimedia experiments to be smoothly 
converted into commercial services in the near future. 
  Chuck Goto, a senior analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities 
(Japan) Inc., said the penetration of cable television, for 
example, is very low in Japan compared with the United States. 
  Software for multimedia also needs to be developed. 
  The Ueda Municipal Government in Nagano Prefecture has been 
assigned by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to 
run a multimedia information center. The center will make 
citizens familiar with the convenience of multimedia by 
providing them with the opportunity to design audiovisual 
software using multimedia equipment. 
  But the project is on hold since nobody in the local 
government has expertise in multimedia operations. 
  "We are at a loss about what to put in the planned center," 
said an Ueda Municipal Government official.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 13 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
Friday reiterated its call for tougher action by the United 
Nations to protect its peacekeeping personnel following death of 
a Malaysian UN military observer in a Serb attack in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday. 
  Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak said: We have repeatedly 
requested the UN to take more firm measures in the Bosnian issue 
not only because of the increasing number of fatal casualties 
among UN peacekeepers but also because of the deaths of hundreds 
of thousands of Bosnians. 
  Bosnia is a dangerous and chaotic place and incidents can 
happen anywhere at any time and our personnel are always at risk. 
  He was speaking at a press conference where he gave details 
of the death of Mejar [Major] Ariffin Zakaria, 33, who was 
killed by Serb mortar fire while on duty Thursday. 
  Najib said stronger action by the UN was needed because the 
situation could deteriorate further in the future.

  [Excerpts] China shares Malaysia's views that the 
membership of the UN Security Council should be reviewed. At 
the same time, it agrees with Malaysia's stand of resolving the 
Bosnian issue. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir was speaking to Malaysian 
journalists in Beijing. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir has welcomed the United 
States Senate vote to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia so that 
the Bosnians could defend themselves from Serb attacks. He said 
the U.S. Senate's move was in line with Malaysia's long-standing 
call that the Bosnians be armed before countries with 
peacekeeping forces there under United Nations auspices withdrew 
them. The prime minister said he had told U.S. President Bill 
Clinton during their meeting in Washington last week that 
withdrawing the peacekeeping forces withouth first arming the 
Bosnians would be like rendering them to be slaughtered by the 
Serb terrorists. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir reiterated his views 
that the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on Bosnia

did not exist. On the other hand, Serbia continues to get arms 
supplies from Belgrade. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 12 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A total of 
104 Vietnamese illegal immigrants from the Sungai Besi temporary 
camp returned home yesterday under the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) voluntary repatriation 
(Volrep) programme. 
  Federal Task Force principal assistant director (settlement) 
Kamarulzaman Murad said all those who returned home had not been 
accorded refugee status after screening. 
  A total of 3,054 Vietnamese illegal mmigrants had 
voluntarily 
returned home since the programme was started three years ago. 
  Kamarul said there were some 6,820 boat people at the Sungai 
Besi camp and those who were not repatriated after the expiry of 
the Volrep programme next year would be sent home in stages 
before 1996. 
  Those who returned home under the programme could resettle 
in 
third countries like the United States and Canada under the 
orderly departure programme (ODP) which is only available in 
Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Answer to Lord's Prayer"] </F>
  [Text] By Objecting to Singapore's offer to host the first 
meeting of the World Trade Organisation [WTO], United States 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor seems to confirm the 
misgivings that the US government's senior-most Asia expert, 
Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, recently expressed in 
a presumably confidential communication to his boss, Mr. Warren 
Christopher. Mr. Lord's complaint was old hat, of course, to 
Asian countries which are at the receiving end of Washington's 
increasingly capricious foreign policy. They are already aware 
that "the sense of optimism and partnership forged in Seattle", 
when President Bill Clinton seemed genuinely to be moved by the 
conviction that his country's destiny was linked with the future 
growth of the Asia-Pacific region, is in danger of being eroded 
because of the unnecessary squabbles and hamhanded bullying that 
the US tries to pass off as diplomacy. 
  The intriguing feature is what provoked Mr. Lord to give 
vent 
to his frustration at this juncture, and how the letter came to 
be printed in a Washington newspaper. Leaks are a way of life 
in Washington, it has been so since the Watergate hearings, 
useful both as an instrument of vendetta and a means of floating 
constructive ideas. The trouble with such a weapon for all 
seasons is that it is not always easy to identify the precise 
purpose. But it can be assumed that most readers will see Mr. 
Lord's letter not as a product of the departmental rivalries and 
personal animosities that are probably rampant in a virtually 
rudderless administration, but as a plea for clarity and 
coherence so that Asian nations are not forced into a united 
front against the US. 
  What this underlines is that US policy has been lacking in 
purpose and direction in a part of the world that is so vital 
for American economic regeneration. The State Department 
spokesman's bland assertion of "excellent" ties with Asian 
countries, and attempt to blame the press for distorting Mr. 
Lord's letter, merely avoided the evidence of consistent 
inconsistency. The most charitable explanation for vacillation 
is that Mr. Clinton is so consumed by domestic preoccupations 
and electoral compulsions that he has little time for foreign 
affairs. Such astounding disinterest at the top may have 
emboldened certain members of his administration to grind their 
personal axes at the cost of long-term American interests, as 
well as global harmony. But the possibility of calculated 
blow-hot-blow-cold tactics, with trade department militants or 
crusaders for human rights roped in to do their acts cannot be 
ruled out, either. 
  Whether the strategy is naive or devious, the end product is 
the same: instead of winning friends and influencing people, 
the Clinton administration seems to be alienating one nation 
after another. Asian countries that value their close economic 
and security ties with the US find such drift disconcerting. If 
business is the business of the US, then Asia is its major 
business partner, today and, even more, tomorrow. The 
statistics for American trade and investment speak for 
themselves. Picking quarrels with Asian countries will 
eventually hurt both sides destroying whatever remains of the 
spirit of Seattle. 
  It is a worrying thought that the world's only superpower 
should act so irresponsibly. The "malaise" that Mr. Lord 
complained of is not confined to relations with Asian countries. 
Evidence of disoriented initiatives in respect of Somalia, 
Haiti and Bosnia only compounds concern. The most effective 
answer to Mr. Lord's indictment would be a firm and coherent 
policy framework based on a clear vision of America's 
international role and permanent relationships. Global security 
demands such an enunciation. If Mr. Clinton fails to respond, 
he fails the world.

arrangements for security and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region are not required with organizations like ASEAN in place. 
Lieutenant General Arturo Enrile made the point at the opening 
of the exercise Anoa Singa 2/94 in Singapore today. He said 
that exercises like Anoa Singa can serve as a model for 
bilateral training arrangements among ASEAN member nations. 
  General Enrile and Singapore's chief of Defense Force, Major 
General Ng Jui Ping, officiated at the opening of the seven-day 
exercise. Anoa Singa will see over 1,000 men involved in the

Indecisive, The War Will Not End"] 
  [Text] The domestic policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia 
remains complicated. It is neither liberal nor non-communist. 
  We have made this complaint because the king -- the revered 
shade of the people -- still hesitates to dissociate with the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] communists. Therefore, our internal policy 
seems to be in the middle point between liberalism and a killing 
field. This is similar to being on the abyss of death. 
  The formula that the king has proposed, such as allowing the 
KHmer Rouge to share power in the government, is not one to 
bring about peace. Neither is the formula for dividing Cambodia 
into three parts. The one on for reelection to seek the winners 
in order to establish peace is a formula that will only lead to 
a more serious war. 
  The failure of the war against the Khmer Rouge, which 
control 
only 10 percent of the territory, was caused by His Majesty's 
indecisive policy. 
  The only formula for achieving peace is to be decisive 
toward 
the communists, to stand firm on the side of the enemies of 
communism who are always ready to help us. If we stand firm on 
just one side, we will not regret even death. 
  If we agree to let the Americans help us sincerely, like 
good 
friends, Thailand, which also depends on the Americans, will 
certainly not dare help the Khmer Rouge. This will be a chance 
for the Khmer Royal Armed Forces to totally crush the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  It is better to take just one side than both. In this 
matter, former Marshal Lon Nol was very brave. He resolutely 
sided with the Americans. It is better to take just one side 
than wavering, which only causes endless misery to the people. 
  Observers of internal politics say that if we reject the 
Khmer Rouge, stop recognizing them, and turn to the free world 
countries for help in strengthening our army, the war will 
certainly end very quickly. 
  By being indecisive, one cannot be a leader and the war will 
not end.

<F P=106> ["Today's Comment" column by Thlang Ambal: "Communism is not </F>
Wanted Anymore in Cambodia!"] 
  [Text] The various communist regimes in the world have all 
committed suicide. Only a few countries remain communist. They 
are moving gradually, however, toward a free market system. 
They are not abolishing with their communism speedily because 
they are ashamed before the rest of the world. These countries 
are Vietnam, the PRC, North Korea, and Cuba. 
  As for our Cambodian people, they do not want communism, and 
especially such a communist like Khieu Samphan, in the royal 
government. 
  Our people, as many as 99.99 percent, want multiparty 
liberal 
democracy. They want genuine freedom, genuine liberalism. 
  Therefore, to serve the people and their interest, we must 
unite as one to eliminate the Khmer Rouge to the last man to 
avoid their presence in the government. We must not allow any 
communist to hold power in our Cambodia. 
  If the "roundtable" accepts the Khmer Rouge, it would be 
tantamount to accepting a tiger, thus suicide for the government. 
  The Cambodian people absolutely reject the Khmer Rouge. No 
influence can oppose this people's will! Anyone who overlooks 
the Khmer Rouge threat should not call himself a Cambodian.

  [Text] The prime minister of the Union of Myanmar [Burma], 
Senior General Than Shwe, hosted a banquet in honor of visiting 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and delegation currently 
on a goodwill visit to Myanmar in the Banquet Hall of the 
People's Assembly compound at 1900 this evening. 
  It was attended by General Maung Aye, vice chairman of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]; Lieutenant 
General Tin Tun, deputy prime minister and SLORC member; various 
SLORC members; ministers; the dean of the diplomatic corps and 
ambassadors; representatives of UN agencies; and responsible 
officials. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe delivered a speech and proposed a toast. 
In his address, he extended a cordial welcome to the visiting 
prime minister and the distinguished members of the Vietnamese 
delegation on behalf of the people and Government of Myanmar. 
He expressed his appreciation that the delegation's visit to 
Myanmar is being led by the prime minister and his wife and that 
he was pleased to have the opportunity to hold the banquet in 
their honor. 
  He said the Union of Myanmar and the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam are two countries which are located in the same region 
and share traditional ties of friendship. He recalled how the 
two countries were supportive of each other during their 
respective national liberation struggles and were able to 
develop a lasting friendship. He said the two developing 
nations as members of the nonaligned movement share identical 
views on regional and international affairs. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe added that the two countries have a 
similar approach in managing national construction tasks aimed 
at raising the standard of living of the people, establishing a 
modern nation and regional stability. He noted that the two are 
both agricultural countries which are practicing a market 
oriented economy. He said he is very heartened to observe the 
success and progress Vietnam has achieved in a short period 
after initiating a market oriented economy. He said the 
countries can observe each other's experiences and contribute to 
mutually beneficial cooperation and help promote the emergence 
of stable and prosperous countries which will lead to a 
developed region. He said relations between Myanmar and Vietnam 
are based on friendship, goodwill, and mutual understanding. 
  He expressed his view that an exchange of visits between the 
leaders of the two countries will further the existing friendly 
relations between Myanmar and Vietnam and promote friendship in 
the next generation. The senior general believes that the visit 
of the prime minister will further promote the bilateral 
friendship. He said he looks forward to the opportunity to 
exchange views on matters of mutual interest and the 
international situation. He expressed his belief that such 
cordial and frank exchanges will contribute to bilateral 
respect, understanding, and friendship. He said such an 
exchange of views will in turn contribute a spirit of mutual 
assistance, understanding, and sympathy among the countries of 
Southeast Asia. He pledged to promote a spirit of mutual 
reliance and assistance in striving toward the emergence of a 
modern and prosperous region. Sr. Gen. Than Shwe then invited 
the Vietnamese prime minister to join him in a toast to the 
lasting friendship between the leaders of Myanmar and the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam; to the health and well-being of 
the president of the SRV, Mr. Le Duc Anh; to the health and 
well-being of the distinguished guests; to the prime minister 
and Madame Vo Van Kiet; and to the health and well-being of all 
the distinguished guests and friends present at the banquet. 
  After the speech, the national anthem of the SRV was played 
by the state band. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
replied and proposed a toast. Following a speech by the 
Vietnamese prime minister, the state band played the national 
anthem of the Union of Myanmar. 
  The popular music band from the Department of Myanmar 
Television Network and Broadcasting Service entertained the 
guests with modern songs before dinner and the Fine Arts 
Department of the Ministry of Culture entertained with classical 
music during dinner. Afterward, the guests were entertained 
with a cultural dance show.

  A number of domestic factors have slowed the growth rate of 
Indonesian exports. Business circles warned the government of 
this far in advance, but the classic problems that have emerged 
in the form of a high-cost economy have not been corrected. The 
problems appear in various forms, including illegal fees and 
lack of transparency in government policies, such as in the 
setting of quotas on textiles and textile products. 
  These were the views of people in Jakarta whom KOMPAS 
contacted Monday, 7 March, to get reaction to the slow growth of 
Indonesian non-oil-and-gas exports, primarily textiles and 
textile products. Those contacted were Indonesian Textiles 
Association (API) Secretary-General Benny Soetrisno and API 
General Chairman Chamroel Djafri. 
  H. Mohamad "Bob" Hasan, general chairman of the Indonesian 
Forestry Community (MPI), who was interviewed Monday after a 
gathering for breaking the fast, also acknowledged a recent 
sluggishness on international markets. "I do not think we can 
avoid what is happening internationally. We cannot do very much 
now, because other countries are having problems," Bob Hasan 
explained. 
  Benny, who said he is "horrified" to see the declining 
competitiveness of Indonesian textiles and textile products on 
global markets, declared that all API directors have submitted 
to the authorities their analyses of the textile industry's 
future. Textiles are one of the four top exports. 
  During the term of the Fifth Development Cabinet, API 
representatives called on Minister of Industry Hartarto; Junior 
Minister of Industry Tunky Ariwibowo; Minister of Trade Arifin 
Siregar; Junior Minister of Trade Soedradjad Djiwandono; Bank 
Indonesia Governor Adrianus Mooy; Minister of Finance J.B. 
Sumarlin; Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance, 
Industry, and Development Control Radius Prawiro; and Minister 
of State and State Secretary Murdiono. 
  "Those reports apparently did not get enough follow-up to 
reassure members of the textile industry. They hoped at least 
for measures to reduce loan interest rates more quickly, and 
improve the investment climate. The macro economy does not 
present a good picture, either. Meanwhile, foreign markets are 
more `furious' in their competition, because they are supported 
by various monetary factors and a much better climate," Benny 
said. 
<H5>  Explain Again </H5>
  In view of this still disadvantageous situation, API 
directors feel it is necessary to discuss further the problem 
with officials in the Sixth Development Cabinet. Their 
scientific explanations as well as concrete examples will at 
least illustrate how concerned industrialists are, which will 
also have an impact on national interests. 
  On that basis, then, the API submitted requests for direct 
dialogues with Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade 
Hartarto; Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance, and 
Development Control Saleh Afiff; Minister of Industry Tunky 
Ariwibowo; Minister of Trade S.B. Joedono; Minister of Finance 
Mar'ie Muhammad; Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono; 
Minister of State and State Secretary Murdiono; and SESDALOPBANG 
[expansion not given] Tjuk Setyohadi. 
  Complete information has been presented to the officials, 
but 
it is not yet known what steps are to be taken to resolve the 
problem. Moreover, there was recent word that at a meeting on 
economics, finance, industry, trade and development control, the 
government acknowledged that exports of Indonesian manufactures 
have declined, rising only by 8.41 percent in 1993. From 1988 to 
1992, however, national exports rose by an average of 15.8 
percent. 
  "It is clear that we have made maximal efforts to defeat 
market competition. Competition is keen, however, primarily from 
new countries such as Vietnam, the PRC, and Turkey, which have 
unbeatable quality. They can sell at low prices, however, 
because their products are efficient. As for us, how can we be 
efficient? From production to export, there are many outside 
costs that have to be paid," Benny said. 
<H5>  Ins and Outs of High Costs </H5>
  The API secretary-general tried to describe frankly the ins 
and outs of the problem. Indonesia's competitors can sell at 
competitive prices because they are not excessively burdened by 
a high-cost economy. 
  For the national textile industry, however, there is a 
series 
of fees that must be paid--from getting permits for imported 
materials, importing them, processing them, to reexporting them. 
These include unofficial fees paid along the roads, which are 
quite large when all are totaled. 
  Receipts cannot be requested for any of these fees, because 
none of the high-cost economy in field operations is found in 
regulations. Automatically, then, no proof can be given of 
having paid such fees. 
  As a result, these various fees automatically go into 
computation of the production component without their being 
recorded in books for auditing by accountants, although the 
value of illegal fees are usually much larger than official 
ones--15 to 20 percent of production costs. 
  This increased expense is naturally incorporated into 
calculations of profit or other revenues, and the result is that 
they are taxable. From this aspect alone, it means that 
companies are hit twice. First, they are bashed by costs in the 
field, and, second, they have to pay taxes. 
  "With conditions like this, how can we compete? From every 
side, we are not competitive, although maximum efficiency goes 
into the commodities," the industrialist said. 
<H5>  Unfair Monetary Climate </H5>
  Another thing that must be borne by industry, said Benny, is 
the upside-down thinking on strengthening the financial 
structure. In the monetary sector, an annual interest of 18 to 
19 percent is imposed on working capital, whereas credit for 
housing incurs only 16 percent. 
  Moreover, credit for housing does not consider whether the 
credit is for luxury housing, where one person may own more than 
one house, or for simple housing. Besides, that sector generally 
spurs more inflation than the demands of working capital. 
  The blows do not end with the interest rate problem alone. 
Tax restitution for exports is not paid for months and 
represents dormant money that cannot be used. "Theoretically, 
according to regulations, restitution should be paid no later 
than one month after exporters complete all administrative 
procedures, but in reality the quickest time is six months," he 
said. 
  To resolve the restitution arrears, the director general for 
taxes finally sent instructions to all regional tax offices in 
the provinces to convert restitution into bank guaranties. 
Nevertheless, in practice the implementation of the regulation 
is yet at a standstill. "Is it because commissions are too 
small, or are the exporters not prepared to complete all 
administrative matters?" 
  "Our question is, has the problem been touched by the 
deregulation measures the government has issued? If it has, why 
have conditions not changed? It not, why is the situation not 
corrected immediately? Thus, whatever the case may be, the basic 
issue in this decline is whether the bureaucrats seriously care 
about realities faced by members of industry. I think that is 
the key to being able to go through the 'needle's eye' in this 
export market struggle," Benny declared. 
  If there are indeed to be no changes, all parties must be 
willing to watch the decline of this "prima donna" of 
contributors to foreign exchange. This can be seen in the fact 
that the TPT [textiles and textile products] continue to grow in 
volume from year to year, while the value per kilogram declined 
in 1993. 
  "That is a fact. What is to be done now is up to the 
government. As far as efficiency is concerned, we have been 
working on that from the beginning. Whether conditions change or 
not, in principle we as industrialists will continue trying to 
ensure that 'our bowl of rice' is not broken or smashed," he 
said. 
<H5>  Quota Distribution System </H5>
  Chamroel Djafri said that besides the external factors there 
are domestic factors that hinder TPT exports. They include, he 
said, high interest rates that burden exporters and export 
procedures that still do not move as smoothly as industrialists 
hope. 
  In addition, he said, the present system for distributing 
quotas does not support steady increases in textile exports. He 
gave an example in which an industrialist obtained a TPT export 
quota for 10 categories, whereas that industrialist did not 
produce as many as 10 categories. 
  He said, too, that besides the fact that the quota 
distribution system does not meet its targets, the system 
remains closed, despite the commotion that has long existed. 
Under the closed system, he said, an industrialist who is able 
to make exports cannot do so because he has no quota. Meanwhile, 
industrialists who receive quotas cannot fulfill their quotas. 
"Therefore, the quota distribution system should be reviewed and 
conducted transparently," he said. 
<H5>  Through the Association </H5>
  In connection with eliminating inefficiency, Bob Hasan said 
that such improvement can be done only through association 
upgrading. The point is, the association understands its members 
and the problems they face. 
  Citing the case of plywood, Bob Hasan, who is also general 
chairman of the Indonesian Wood Panel Association (APKINDO), 
said that APKINDO members practically do not have a quota 
problem any longer. A joint promotion team, in cooperation with 
a price stabilization team, decides the distribution of quotas 
for each member. 
  The joint promotion team itself is formed on the basis of 
the 
export goals of each member. The company with the most exports 
to a specific country automatically becomes team chairman, while 
the position of deputy chairman is filled by the company with 
the second most exports to that country. 
  The joint promotion team then gets data on the capacities of 
each member. "Quotas for the members are decided based on that 
data. The results are then submitted to the Department of Trade, 
which is the authority for distributing quotas to APKINDO 
members," Bob Hasan explained. 
  According to the APKINDO general chairman, there has been 
practically no dissatisfaction or deviation with regard to quota 
distribution. "As general chairman, practically all I have to do 
is wait for reports. I intervene only if there is disagreement. 
In APKINDO, small companies do not have to be oppressed, for 
they get the first opportunity when there are additional 
quotas," Bob Hasan declared.

  [Text] President Ramos has ordered that the recording 
business not be classified as part of mass media in order to 
open the industry to foreign investors. 
  "In furtherance of the policy to promote foreign investments 
pursuant to the 1991 Foreign Investments Act, this Office 
[Office of the President] hereby adopts the policy that the 
recording business shall not be considered as part of `mass 
media' within the purview of the 1987 Constitution and, as such, 
shall not be included in the Foreign Investment Negative List A 
pursuant to the 1991 Foreign Investments Act," a memorandum 
issued by the president said. 
  The president also directed National Economic and 
Development 
Authority Director General Cielito Habito, [Department of] Trade 
and Industry [DTI] Secretary Rizalino Navarro, Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Rosario Lopez, and Board of 
Investments Managing Head and Undersecretary Tomas Alcantara to 
ensure the effective implementation of the policy. 
  President Ramos issued the policy upon the recommendation of 
Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing after 
studying a position paper submitted by Warner Music Philippines. 
  The position paper was opposing the opinion of the SEC that 
records and movie films are considered mass media and therefore, 
any entity engaged in the production or distribution thereof, is 
subject to the constitutional requirement that the ownership and 
management shall be limited to Filipinos. 
  In his meeting with representatives of the SEC, DTI and the 
Office of the President's legal office (OP-LO) last April 15, 
Quisumbing said the SEC representatives maintained their stand 
that the recording business forms part of "mass media." 
  The DTI and OPLO representatives, however, contended that 
the 
recording business should not be considered as part of "mass 
media" which traditionally refer to radio, television and print. 
  Quisumbing said all participants, noting President Ramos' 
call on the need for policies within the national programs to 
"open up" the economy and achieve the country's competitiveness, 
agreed that while the SEC actions can only be appealed to the 
Supreme Court, the president has authority to issue policies 
binding on the SEC, an agency under the administrative 
supervision of the Office of the President.

<F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>
  [Text] Talks with another rightist group, the Kawal ng 
Sambayanang Pilipino [Soldiers of the Filipino People] (KSP), 
are progressing smoothly in contrast to the talks with the 
Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist Revolutionary 
Alliance] (RAM). 
  Professor Alfredo Tadiar, government panel chairman, also 
said government and the military soldiers known to be loyal to 
former President Marcos have signed three drafts over the 
weekend. 
  Meanwhile, all his panel and the RAM have done is exchange 
position papers, he added. 
  According to a source close to the government panel, the 
KSP's advantage lies in its small membership. "Being a smaller 
group, it is easier for them to come into position and express 
what they want during discussions," he said. 
  The KSP, led by Brig. Gen.Jose Maria Zumel, signed with Mr. 
Tadiar's panel drafts on reform in administration of justice, 
reform in the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine 
National Police (PNP) and government reforms. 
  Mr. Tadiar said that unlike with the RAM, his panel only has 
a few issues to settle with the KSP. Although there are 
similarities in their talking points, many issues have been set 
aside by the group in order to give way to more substantial 
issues, he said. 
  Meanwhile, government is not making much progress with RAM 
panel led by Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina. 
  A government negotiator who requested anonymity said all 
efforts have to be exerted in order to leach RAM's working 
committee members. 
  He also admitted that aside from exchanging position papers, 
nothing else has been achieved with the military reform group. 
  At present, a meeting is being scheduled to discuss 
electoral 
reforms proposed by the RAM. The government panel already has a 
response to the group's proposals, he said, but could not 
arrange for a meeting. He also said the RAM has yet to submit 
their formal objection to the government's attrition policy. 
  On a less brighter note, talks between government and the 
National Democratic Front (NDF) are in peril after the 
Philippine National Police refused to release captured communist 
Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon and four others even as charges 
filed against them have been dismissed. 
  In a faxed statement, Luis Jalandoni, NDF vice chairperson 
for international affairs and representative to the talks, 
threatened to back out of talks if government "will not respect 
the rights of communist Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon." 
  "The NDF will officially disengage from talks with the 
Philippine Government and cut off communications with government 
panel headed by Mr. Howard Dee, should the rights of Tiamzon and 
her companions not be respected by the Ramos regime," Mr. 
Jalandoni said. 
  Ms. Tiamzon, third in the Communist Party of the Philippines 
(CPP) hierarchy, was arrested by police authorities last week 
with three other ranking communist leaders and one active member. 
  The PNP Intelligence Command said Ms. Tiamzon has a standing 
warrant of arrest for two counts of kidnapping with serious 
illegal detention. 
  The group was also charged with illegal possession of 
ammunition and violation of election gun ban which were 
dismissed by a Bulacan prosecutor. 
  The NDF demanded the communist leaders be released 
immediately in order that the moribund process be saved. 
  According to Chief Superintendent Jewel Canson, the arrest 
of 
Ms. Tiamzon and company should hasten the resumption of the 
stalled talks with the Left. 
  Government panel chairman Howard Dee also said that with the 
arrest, government and the NDF have all the reasons to sit at 
the negotiating table. 
  But Mr. Jalandoni said the arrest will not in anyway enhance 
the chances for peace. He also called for the immediate release 
of Ms. Tiamzon and objected to government's plans of filing 
additional charges against her based on offenses allegedly 
committed during the past.

  [Text] All persons who appear in the Alex Boncayao Brigade 
[ABB] hit list, including eight generals and government 
officials, had better watch closely their backs. 
  Director Agerico Kagaoan, PNP [Philippine National Police] 
operations director, said the communist urban terrorist group is 
"very active" and determined to pursue its "mission" to 
liquidate people it perceives to have committed "crimes against 
people." 
  Last Saturday, gunmen killed dismissed Chief Inspector 
Timoteo Zarcal in front of his residence in Felix Huertas, Sta. 
[Santa--Holy] Cruz, Manila. 
  Hours later, the ABB through Felimon Lagman, chief of the 
Manila-Rizal Party Committee, a breakaway faction from the 
Communist Party of the Philippines, admitted responsibility. 
  Zarcal was ninth on the ABB hit list. 
  Despite the ABB admission, Kagaoan said probers have not 
counted out other suspects. 
  Chief Inspector Jose Pring said Sunday Zarcal could have 
been 
killed by his detractors who were only using the ABB to mislead 
investigators. 
  Pring and Zarcal were arrested last year at the house of 
Vice 
President Joseph Estrada on charges of kidnapping 
Chinese-Filipinos. 
  Though acquitted last month by a Pasig court, they were 
included in the ABB hit list released last 16 January. 
  Also on the list are 98 police and military personnel and at 
least 170 government officials and several civilians, including 
movie personalities, businessmen, and suspected drug lords for 
liquidation. 
  The police officers include former PNP Director General 
Cesar 
Nazareno; Director Vicente Vinarao, chief of the National 
Penitentiary; Director Manuel Roxas, Bureau of Immigration and 
Deportation commissioner; PNP Deputy Director General Gerry 
Flores; Chief Superintendent Dictador Alqueza, former Regional 
Command 11 director; Director Marino Filart, former Capcom 
[Capital Command] chief; Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ramon Montano, 
presidential consultant for police affairs; Chief Supt. (ret.) 
Ernesto Diokno, former WPDC [Western Police District Command] 
chief. 
  The list also includes Speaker Jose de Venecia, former 
Councilor and cager Abe King, and movie producer Cheng Muhlach. 
  The ABB said the personalities were involved in graft and 
corruption, drug pushing, prostitution, and kidnap-for-ransom 
cases. 
  Last month, suspected ABB members gunned down Isidro 
Florentino, father of Allan Florentino, a suspect in the 
rape-slay of Rosielyn Federico, a fastfood employee.

  [Text] The Muslim position is expected to be further 
strengthened in the ongoing peace talks with the government. 
This expectation is anchored on the talks held for the first 
time by the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] and the Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front on 7 May in Cotabato City. 
  MNLF spokesman Zain Jali said that the talks addressed the 
formation of an alliance between the two groups to adopt a 
unified position in the peace talks with the government. The 
two Muslim groups seek autonomy for 13 provinces and four cities 
in Mindanao.

  [Text] Borrowings in the form of securities issued by the 
national government, its agencies and corporations reached 
P661.32 billion [Philippine pesos] as of end-March this year, a 
0.92 percent increase from the previous year's level. 
  The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the 
Philippines] (BSP) in a statement indicated that the government 
is now paying more for its borrowings with a weighted interest 
rate of 15.419 percent vis a vis 14.988 percent a quarter ago. 
  The national government was a heavy borrower, issuing 
P661.32 
billion securities out of the total outstanding securities. 
Government corporations issued P2.24 billion while the BSP, 
P22.23 billion. 
  In the first quarter of this year alone, gross issuances 
amounted to P335.66 billion. This was actually down by P0.6 
billion or 0.18 percent from quarter-ago sales. Redemption of 
matured sales totalled P329.64 billion. 
  The BSP said net sales from the issuances dropped by 95.47 
percent from P132.94 billion recorded in the preceding quarter 
to P6.02 billion. 
  "The national government remained the top issuer accounting 
for P330.16 billion or 98.36 percent, followed by Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas with P5.50 billion or 1.64 percent. There were no 
flotations by government corporations during the quarter, BSP 
said. 
  The auction sale of T-bills [Treasury bills] amounted to 
P192.69 billion while that of the special GOCC [government owned 
or controlled corporation] services sold over the counter summed 
up to P32.15 billion, the BSP said. 
  The BSP series worth P176 billion which matured in March was 
rolled over by an equivalent amount, the BSP said. 
  The BSP said the composite weighted average yield rate on 
auctioned bills dropped to 15.46 percent or 12.9 basis points 
lower than previous quarter's 15.59 percent. 
  Three series of 3-year Floating Rate Treasury Notes (FRTNs) 
worth P16.04 billion were sold through auction bringing 
outstanding FRTNs to P112.35 billion out of an aggregate 
authorized flotation ceiling of P135 billion, the BSP said. 
  Outstanding BSP issues receded to P22.23 billion down by 
23.42 percent a quarter ago as a result of net redemptions of 
P6.80 billion. Only P5.51 billion were issued/rolled-over 
against maturities of P12.31 billion. 
  Taxes paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue during the 
first 
quarter amounted to P2.27 billion or an increase of P0.75 
billion over previous quarter's P1.52 billion.

  [Text] The full development of the country's financial 
markets continue to be stunted by various economic, financial 
and structural barriers, hence our underdevelopment as compared 
with our neighbors in this regard. 
  In a recent speech before the Foreign Exchange Association 
of 
the Philippines, Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves (3d 
District) lamented the existence of seven major obstacles to 
this growth namely: 

  -  The huge old Central Bank deficit, amounting to some P 
[Philippine pesos] 320 billion, "which burdened the entire 
financial system for a long time;" 
  -  The consolidated public sector deficit, tagged at P20.7 
billion 
last year and targeted at 27.7 billion this year, "financed 
largely through domestic borrowing which crowded out private 
investments;" 
  -  The close-knit family structure of many companies which does 
not encourage sourcing of funds through public offering; 
  -  The prolonged existence of two exchanges wherein they used 
different prices on the same issue, with the effect that 
investors were not able to enjoy the best price; 
  -  The restrictive financial policies as evidenced by previously 
stringent foreign exchange regulations and bank branching rules; 
  -  Poor market information on the availability, risk and yield 
of 
alternative assets which is a major cause of the observed 
segmentation of the financial market that includes the presence 
of a sizable informal sector; and 
  -  The absence of an institution, separate from the Bangko 
Sentral 
ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP) and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will exclusively 
address the development of capital markets. 

    Mr. Teves lamented further the underdevelopment of these 
markets is emphasized more when compared with their counterparts 
among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member 
states, saying: "Compared to our ASEAN neighbors, our financial 
markets, especially the capital market, are still relatively 
underdeveloped (while) ASEAN financial markets have been growing 
by leaps and bounds." 
  First, the ratio of domestic liquidity (M3) to gross 
domestic 
product (GDP) in the country stood at only 34.4 percent in 1990, 
as compared with 74.6 percent in Thailand, 68.2 percent in 
Malaysia and 35.2 percent in Indonesia during the same period. 
  "This low M3 to GDP ratio implies that the range of our 
financial instruments is still limited," Mr. Teves observed. 
  "There is an absence of variety of alternative debt and 
equity instruments, while incentives to savings is unattractive 
and inadequate," he added. 
  "Credit allocation is distorted and there is a sizable 
informal sector, particularly the 5/6 type of lenders, which 
serves the financing requirements of investors." 
  Second, although the Philippines has the oldest stock 
exchange in Asia, its performance in terms of the number of 
listed participants (183 as compared with 300 each in the 
relatively young markets of Malaysia and Thailand last December) 
and of stock market capitalization (which stood at 15.1 percent, 
of GDP as of 1990, compared with 105.9 percent for Malaysia and 
29.5 percent for Thailand for the same period) has left much to 
be desired. 
  Finally, the level of credit to the private sector as a 
percent of GDP in the Philippines stood at only 19.4 percent in 
1990, compared with 68.7 percent in Thailand, 67.9 percent in 
Malaysia and 35.9 percent in Indonesia during the same year. 
  "The low ratio of credit to private sector to GDP in the 
Philippines is an indication of the crowding out of private 
investors due to large government participation in the bonds 
market," Mr. Teves observed. 
  "As of 1992, the outstanding issuances of National 
Government 
had reached P445 billion," he added. 
  "More than half of these government securities issued were 
in 
the form of high-yielding short-term Treasury bill." 
  These problems notwithstanding, Mr. Teves lauded 
government's 
recent moves to rectify the current situation, particularly 
through six measures, namely: 

  -  The creation of the BSP and the consequent rehabilitation 
of the old Central Bank which is expected to reduce the burden 
on the financial system, especially on banks, in the form of a 
reduced reserve requirement; 
  -  The creation of the Philippine Stock Exchange which 
introduced 
a one-price system, thus resolving the issue of inefficient 
pricing that existed during the time when there were two 
separate exchanges offering the same products at different 
prices; 
  -  The liberalization of foreign exchange regulations which has 
facilitated the entry of foreign investments and the 
repatriation of earnings and capital; 
  -  The liberalization of the banking sector which includes the 
removal of the policy of auctioning branches; 
  -  The utilization of the stock market as a vehicle for 
privatizing government-owned and-controlled corporations; and 
  -  The improvement in the SEC's policy and regulation regarding 
pricing, insider trading and disclosure of information. 

    Still, there are three indispensable,fundamental conditions 
for the unimpeded growth of the financial sector which the 
country has yet to see, namely: 

  -  A stable macro economic environment that encourages wealth 
holders to maintain their savings in financial instruments and 
with financial institutions, as opposed to such non-liquid 
assets as land and jewelry; 
  -  An effective prudential regulatory environment that will 
encourages safe and sound financial practices to prevent too 
frequent bank failures and the collapse of financial 
institutions, which cause a setback in public confidence in the 
financial system; and 
  -  The regulatory environment should balance prudential 
regulation 
with providing enough flexibility so that financial innovation 
is not stymied and financial players are able to provide 
creative solutions to various needs in the market.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Dinh Khai in Rangoon] </F>
  [Text] Dear friends: Senior General Prime Minister Than 
Shwe and his wife gave a grand banquet on the evening of 11 
April in the capital city of Rangoon in honor of Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet, his wife, and members of our government delegation 
on their official friendship visit to the Union of Myanmar 
[Burma]. Also attending the function on the Myanmar side were 
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw and many high-ranking Myamar 
government officials. 
  In his speech at the banquet, Prime Minister Than Shwe said: 
[Begin Than Shwe recording, in Burmese fading into Vietnamese 
translation] Your Excellency Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Madame 
Vo Van Kiet, distinguished guests, and friends: On behalf of the 
people and government of the Union of Myanmar, I would like to 
extend our warmest greetings to His Excellency Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet and distinguished members of the Vietnamese delegation. 
My wife and I are honored and pleased to welcome the delegation 
headed by Your Excellency on its visit to Myanmar and to host 
this banquet in honor of Your Excellency. 
  The Union of Myanmar and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 
[SRV] are two regional countries linked by traditional 
friendship. From the efforts made by leaders of both countries 
to restore independence, we still remember the lasting 
friendship fostered through the traditions of mutual assistance 
and understanding. During the Cold War era, ours were among the 
developing countries that participated in the Nonaligned 
Movement [NAM]. We have shared similar views on regional and 
international issues. We have also shared almost similar views 
on ways of building each country into a modern nation, while at 
the same time making efforts to improve the people's living 
standards and contributing to regional stability. 
  Now that agricultural countries have shifted to 
market-oriented economies, I follow with keen interest the 
considerable achievements by Vietnam within a short time in the 
framework of its market-oriented economic policy. The 
application of knowledge acquired from each country's 
experiences and the promotion of cooperation for mutual benefit 
will help us bring about lasting stability and prosperity in 
each country, and thereby contributing to regional prosperity. 
  Your Excellency: The relations between Vietnam and Myanmar 
are based on friendship, goodwill, and mutual understanding. 
Those relations have been consolidated and strengthened through 
exchanges of visits by leaders of our two countries. I am 
convinced that your visit will further consolidate the existing 
friendly ties between our two countries. I am pleased to say 
that during your current visit, we can exchange views on 
regional and international issues of common concern. I am 
positive that through straightforward and open-minded exchanges 
of views, we can further enhance the traditions of mutual 
respect, mutual understanding, and friendship between our two 
countries. Based on that willingness to share, the traditions 
of mutual assistance, goodwill, mutual understanding, and 
cooperation will become dynamic in our Southeast Asian region. 
Prompted by that spirit of mutual assistance, let us be 
determined to work toward the birth of modern and prosperous 
countries. 
  Excellencies, distinguished guests, and dear friends: I 
would 
like to invite you to a toast to the lasting friendship between 
the Union of Myanmar and the SRV as well as for the good health 
and happiness of His Excellency Le Duc Anh, president of the 
SRV; His Excellency Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his wife, our 
distinguished guests; and all of our distinguished guests and 
friends present here this evening. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet then delivered his reply speech. 
He said: 
  [Begin Vo Van Kiet recording] Your Excellency Prime 
Minister, 
ladies and gentlemen: I am delighted to make my first visit to 
the friendly neighboring country of Myanmar, a country with a 
rich cultural heritage reflected in the well-known Golden 
Temple, and to meet the warm-hearted, diligent, and friendly 
people of Myanmar. I am deeply moved at the memory of our late 
beloved leader President Ho Chi Minh, who visited your country 
36 years ago and opened a new stage for the relationship between 
our countries. I would like to express our sincere gratitude 
for the warm and solemn reception that Your Excellency Prime 
Minister and Madame Than Shwe and the people of Myanmar have 
given me and my delegation in our official and friendly visit to 
Myanmar. I would also like to thank Your Excellency for your 
fine statement about the country and people of Vietnam, as well 
as on the traditional and friendly relations between the two 
peoples. 
  Vietnam and Myanmar are both located in Southeastern Asia 
and 
share numerous similarities in culture and history. The two 
peoples have traditional, long-lasting relations during our 
struggles for independence. People of Vietnam never forget the 
valuable support that the government and people of Myanmar gave 
us from the very early years when our republic was still in its 
infancy. Rangoon was the first gateway for Vietnam to reach the 
rest of the world during the time Vietnam was isolated during 
the 1940's. Vietnam and Myanmar were shoulder to shoulder in 
the Afro-Asia Solidarity Movement against colonialism during the 
1950's. We are happy to see that in the new situation, our fine 
traditional relations, which had always been heartily fostered 
by the two peoples, are now developing along with our sincere 
cooperation in the aim to bring prosperity for each of our 
countries. I share with you the joy of seeing the great pace of 
positive changes which are taking place in your beautiful 
country, and I sincerely wish the people of the Union of Myanmar 
stability and prosperity. 
  In recent years, with our correct renovation policy, the 
people of Vietnam have made important achievements, and are now 
entering the first stage of industrialization and modernization 
aimed at reaching the objectives of being a wealthy people, a 
powerful country, and an equitable and civilized society. Our 
achievements are also closely connected with our independent, 
self-reliant, open, and diversified foreign policy, with the 
active cooperation of friends, far and near alike, including 
Myanmar, a neighbor country which always have friendly 
sentiments towards Vietnam. 
  On this occasion, I would like to affirm to Your Excellency 
that the government and people of Vietnam always regard highly 
the development of multi-faceted and friendly cooperation with 
Myanmar on the basis of respect for independence, sovereignty, 
non- interference in each other's internal affairs, equality, 
and mutual benefit. We consider this a positive contribution to 
the development of our countries and also an important 
contribution to the cooperation developing in Southeast Asia. 
  I am pleased with the results of our meeting this afternoon, 
and with our joint statement affirming the scope of cooperation 
and direction for development of our relations, our trade 
agreement, our tourism cooperation agreement, and our agreement 
on establishment of the joint cooperation committee. I think 
that this is an important new step in the relationship between 
our countries, and I believe that our official visit to Myanmar 
will contribute to further accelerating the friendship and 
cooperation between our countries for the interests of the two 
peoples, and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity 
for Southeast Asia. 
  In this warm and friendly atmosphere today, I would like to 
propose a toast for the happiness and prosperity of the people 
of Myanmar, for the good health of Your Excellency Prime 
Minister, Madame Than Shwe, and the leaders of Myanmar, and for 
the ever-developing friendship and cooperation between Vietnam 
and Myanmar, and for the good health of all guests and friends 
[end recording]. 
  Dear friends: After the solemn banquet, Prime Minister Vo 
Van 
Kiet, his wife, and members of our government delegation viewed 
an interesting concert program performed by Burmese artists.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 12 KYODO -- China has increased its naval 
presence in the area of the disputed Spratly Islands in the 
South China Sea, Vietnamese Government sources said Thursday. 
The sources, including officials of the Vietnamese Foreign 
Ministry, said the number of Chinese naval vessels dispatched to 
the area has increased amid heightening tension between the two 
countries over the issue of oil concessions. 
  Some sources, including a diplomat of one of the members of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), suggested a 
military conflict could break out depending on how Vietnam 
reacts to the latest Chinese moves. 
  Chinese ships in the area are said to number eight, 
including 
at least one frigate and two research ships, as well as landing 
craft, torpedo boats and data collection vessels. 
  Unconfirmed reports are circulating to the effect that 
Vietnam has rushed its own naval vessels to the area. 
  Hanoi is said to have stationed Navy ships on a regular 
basis 
at an ostensible fishing port facility that it built last year 
on one of the Spratly Islands. 
  The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday Vietnam holds 
sole rights to exploit natural resources in the Tuchinh and 
Thanhlong (Blue Dragon) areas in the South China Sea. 
  China on Thursday criticized Vietnam's contract with U.S. 
oil 
company Mobil Corp. and Japanese partners to explore the area as 
"illegal" and a violation of Beijing's sovereignty but said the 
dispute should be resolved peacefully. Beijing claims 
"irrevocable sovereignty" over the entire area around the 
Spratly Islands, including the adjacent area where Mobil has 
said it would continue with offshore oil exploration work. 
  The Spratly Islands are also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, the 
Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 12 -- The spokesperson of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam today, reacting to 
foreign reports dated May 10 on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs' statement relating to the Thanhlong Sea area, 
reiterates the following: 
  `As determined by international law, especially the 1982 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, the areas of Tuchinh and 
Thanhlong lie within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and 
continental shelf, entirely under Vietnam's sovereignty. 
Vietnam has the sovereign right to explore and exploit natural 
resources in these areas by itself or in cooperation with other 
foreign countries, a right with which no other country has the 
right to interfere. These areas are in no way related to the 
Truongsa archipelago or the adjacent waters. Any statement or 
act contrary to this principle is illegal and runs counter to 
international law'.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 13 -- The European Union (EU) hoped 
that the relations of lasting and all-sided cooperation between 
EU and Vietnam would be strengthened in the fields of economy, 
industry, investment, insurance, services, science and research, 
mutual commerce, culture, agriculture, and so on, said the EU 
ambassador in Vietnam. 
  Mr. J. Gwyn Morgan, EU ambassador to Vietnam-head of the 
delegation of the Commission of the European Communities, was 
speaking at a press conference held in Hanoi in May 11 afternoon 
on the occasion of seminar entitled Single European Market 
organized in the city from May 11-12. 
  The seminar provided information about the single European 
market, the role and functioning of the EU, including 
EU-Vietnamese bilateral relations, legal matters, technical 
standards, marketing and distribution of which main branches are 
textiles, garments, processed food and food processing, seafood, 
tropical fruit and vegetables, footwear, leather and leather 
products. 
  The seminar was held by EC with assistance from the Societe 
General de Development S.A., OAV (the German East Asia 
Association), Ernst and Young, and the Vietnam Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Trade. 
  In the years 1986-1990, the two-way trade value between EC 
and Vietnam increased 100 million ECU every year. In 1993 alone 
it exceeded one billion U.S. dollars, Mr Morgan noted. He said 
he hoped before autumn a framework agreement of cooperation 
between the EU and Vietnam would be signed. First of all, he 
said, a coordination office of EU will be opened in Hanoi in 
June this year. 
  On EC programme relating to Vietnamese non-refugees from 
camps in Southeast Asia, he said the programme would conclude at 
the end of Nov. 1994. That does not mean the EU will not 
continue to be concerned in the international and bilateral 
efforts to the Vietnamese Government to help the refugees 
return, he stressed.

  [Text] Vice Premier Nguyen Khanh this week left for an 
official visit to Syria and Egypt. Meanwhile, Vice President 
Nguyen Thi Binh has been in South Africa to attend the 
swearing-in ceremony of the new South African president, Nelson 
Mandela. These diplomatic activities show relations between 
Vietnam and countries in Africa and the Middle East are 
developing positively. Here is our comments on these events: 
  Due to geographic difficulties, relations between Vietnam 
and 
countries in Africa and the Middle East have not developed, 
though the peoples in that region offered support towards the 
national liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people in the 
past as well as in national construction at present. Those 
geographical obstacles are now less difficult. Many countries 
in that region have invited Vietnamese leaders to pay working 
visits. In response to their warm sentiments, in March Vice 
President Nguyen Thi Binh led a Vietnamese delegation to visit 
Algeria, Guinea, and Mali. Vietnam signed with those three 
countries agreements on economic, cultural, scientific and 
technological, and trade cooperation. At the end of last week, 
Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh left for South Africa to attend 
the swearing-in ceremony of President Nelson Mandela. There, 
she met leaders of African countries and affirmed Vietnam's 
determination to strengthen cooperative ties with them, 
particularly with the new South Africa. 
  In the Middle East, with the current visit by Vice Premier 
Nguyen Khanh to Syria and Egypt, new prospects in cooperation 
have been opened up. Trade agreements have been signed between 
Vietnam and Syria and Egypt. Vietnam now has expanded its 
relations with all regions in the world. It has genuinely 
integrated into the international community. Vietnam's foreign 
policy to befriend all countries in the world and its 
achievement in the current economic renovation are keys to 
Vietnam's successes.

<F P=106> ["Text" of government resolution No. 48-CP on administrative </F>
reform -- dated 4 May] 
  [Text] At present, administrative procedures, especially 
procedures for receiving and resolving works related to citizens 
and organizations have been stipulated by various sectors and 
echelons. They lack uniformity, and are cumbersome and 
complicated. Such procedures are usually established at the 
convenience of the organs in charge without paying adequate 
attention to the aspirations and convenience of the people 
concerned. Many state organs have failed to correctly comply 
with stipulations on receiving and resolving work related to the 
people. There have also been instances of passing the buck 
among state organs in charge which eventually leads to the work 
being unresolved. Worse still, many procedures, expenses, and 
fees have been created not in accordance with their authority. 
The collection of charges and fees has also been made above set 
levels. Regulations on state administrative procedures have not 
been made public, nor have competent and qualified cadres been 
appointed to receive and resolve work. 
  When receiving and resolving work related to the people, not 
a few civil servants have shown less respect for the people and 
have adopted officialism. They act as if they are doing a 
favor. Worse still, they inconvenience the people by asking for 
bribes. Resolving works in this way has not only caused a loss 
of time, energy, and money for various public organs, units, and 
the people concerned, but is also the main reason for 
corruption, thus causing indignation and eroding the people's 
confidence in the state. Therefore, reforming administrative 
procedures is now a pressing demand that meets the people's 
legitimate demands. This is also an important goal of 
administrative reform. The goal to be attained is to implement 
a radical change in relations between the procedures for 
resolving works between state organs themselves, between state 
organs and other agencies and units, and between state organs 
and the people in receiving and resolving works. 
  The government hereby implements the following works, 
beginning in the second quarter of 1994: 
  1. First, cabinet members, heads of government organs, and 
chairmen of provincial and city people's committees directly 
under the central authority must continue to carry out the prime 
minister's directive No. 40-TTG, dated 29 October 1992, 
stipulating several points in the working relationship between 
comrades in charge of the administrative apparatuses at all 
levels. The main substance of these points is as follows: 
  A. The law on government organization and the government's 
operational statute affirms: Deputy prime ministers are those 
helping the prime minister and acting on his behalf in providing 
operational guidance and taking direct responsibility for 
resolving various works within the areas of activity assigned. 
They must regard this task as being delegated by the prime 
minister. Cabinet ministers must maintain regular contact with 
the prime minister and must personally meet and work with the 
prime minister when needed. When working with a prime minister, 
they must comply with the advice of the deputy prime minister 
concerned, regarding his advice as being made on behalf of the 
prime minister. 
  This spirit must also be displayed in the working relations 
between cabinet members and the chairmen of those provincial and 
city people's comittees directly under the central authority and 
also between those comrades in charge of various administrative 
echelons in a province or city. This is to enhance individual 
responsibility, ensure centralized and unified leadership, 
overcome bad bureaucratic practices, and avoid inconveniences 
and sluggishness. 
  B. In the working relations of cabinet members and the 
chairmen of provincial and city people's committees directly 
under the central authority, cabinet ministers must personally 
work with the chairman or the deputy chairman -- as assigned by 
his chairman -- of a provincial or city people's committee 
directly under the central authority to resolve promptly and 
dutifully those issues within their authority in the shortest 
possible period. The state of a cabinet minister or a deputy 
minister forcing the chairman or the deputy chairman of a 
provincial or city people's committee to have advance meetings 
with each department of the ministry concerned before the 
minister resolves an issue must be ended. In cases where 
suggestions made by a province or city involve many ministries, 
the responsible ministry must act as a lead in discussions with 
other relevant ministries and must not let the chairman of a 
provincial or city people's committee approach every ministry to 
solicit advice from various ministers prior to having the issue 
resolved by the minister in charge of the sector concerned. 
  C. Regarding works beyond the authority of a minister, the 
chairman or vice chairman of a provincial and city people's 
committee directly under the central authority must work with 
the prime minister or a deputy prime minister. In this case, 
the minister in charge of the government office must be 
dutybound to arrange a meeting for the prime minister or one of 
his deputies to work directly with the chairman or vice chairman 
of the provincial or city people's committee directly under the 
central authority. 
  Those stipulations cited in Points B and C above will also 
be 
applied to the heads of those organs belonging to the government. 
  D. In the working relations between the chairman of a 
provincial or city people's committee with the directors of 
various offices and with the chairmen of precinct and district 
people's committees, such works must also be dealt with in 
accordance with the above spirit. 
  E. In the working relations between the chairman of a 
precinct or district people's committee and the chairman of a 
village and ward people's committee, this spirit must also be 
fully observed. The chairman of a precinct or district people's 
committee must devote a large part of his time to staying close 
to various villages and wards in order to resolve works locally, 
trying to minimize cases where works are to be resolved through 
conferences. 
  2. Ministries, heads of ministerial-level organs, and heads 
of government organs, and the chairmen of provincial and city 
people's committees directly under the central authority must 
initiate a drive to scrutinize all stipulations now in force 
governing administrative procedures and charges and fees in 
areas under their responsibility, including those stipulations 
promulgated by lower echelons. This is to promptly restrict 
those unauthorized administrative stipulations and procedures 
and to supplement and revise those procedures no longer 
compatible with reality, which are disrupting the activities of 
other organs and units and inconveniencing the people. 
  If there are stipulations promulgated by higher echelons 
which they deem necessary to revise, supplement, or abrogate, 
they must petition the organs concerned to consider the possible 
revision, supplementation, or abrogation. This work must be 
carried out in all areas of activity with an emphasis on 
procedures governing the granting of permits for exports and 
imports, for investment activities, and for house construction 
and repair; procedures governing land allocation, the 
registration of business operations and occupational practice, 
the ownership and use of communications means, and household 
registration; procedures governing entry and exit from the 
country, and the registration of buying, selling, or transfer of 
assets, capital loans, notary public, and enterprise inspections. 
  As for old procedures which are now still compatible and 
which are stipulated fragmentarily in various documents, they 
must now be organized into a single memorandum in accordance 
with the authority of the minister and the head of the 
ministerial-level organ, or the head of the government organ 
concerned in order to facilitate implementation, inspection, and 
supervision. 
  Those procedures related to many ministries and sectors, and 
the ministry with the main functions of state administration are 
responsible for coordinating with various ministries concerned 
in the promulgation of interministerial stipulations. 
  Ministers, heads of ministerial-level organs, heads of 
government organs, and chairmen of those provincial and city 
people's committees directly under the central authority must 
directly inspect and provide guidance for the deployment of this 
task beginning immediately from the second quarter of 1994, 
regarding this as one of the central tasks of their ministries, 
sectors, and localities to be carried out between now and the 
end of 1994. 
  After reexamining various administrative procedures, the 
ministers, heads of ministerial-level organs, and heads of 
government agencies, within their administrative authority, must 
make public the system of documents which stipulate new 
procedures under various formats so each agency, unit, and 
citizen is aware of and complies with them. Upon completion of 
revising and supplementing a procedure, they must promptly make 
it public. This task must be completed by the end of 1994 at 
the latest. Meanwhile, through inspection and reexamination of 
various administrative procedures of those sectors concerned, we 
must promptly help other agencies and units revamp all those 
elements receiving and resolving works related to citizens; and 
we must be determined to deal with and remove those cadres found 
guilty of abuse of their positions, or who are found unqualified. 
  3. In addition to laws, regulations, and other legal 
documents of the government or the prime minister, only the 
ministers, the heads of ministerial-level organs, and the heads 
of government agencies are authorized to stipulate 
administrative procedures for activities under their area of 
management. They must take responsibility for the government 
for these procedures. 
  New stipulations and those orders supplementing, revising, 
or 
rescinding those stipulations on existing administrative 
procedures must be put into writing. This will ensure their 
uniformity, accuracy, and consistency with the laws, 
regulations, and other legal documents of the government or the 
prime minister. 
  All stipulations on administrative procedures must be 
simple, 
comprehensible, and easily carried out and must be openly 
promulgated so each public organ, unit, and the people are aware 
of them. 
  As for those stipulations on administrative procedures under 
the responsibility of various ministries and central-level 
sectors which need separate stipulations to suit the 
characteristics of a number of localities, ministries and 
central-level sectors must write letters delegating their 
authority to provincial and city people's committees concerned 
directly under the central authority to promulgate them. Such 
stipulations of the provincial and city people's committees must 
have the consensus of those ministries and sectors in charge of 
this field of activity and all those stipulations on 
administrative procedures of ministries and sectors must be 
openly promulgated. 
  4. Responsible ministries, sectors, and localities must 
scrupulously comply with decision No. 276-TT, dated 28 July 
1992, of the chairman of the Council of Ministers -- now known 
as the prime minister -- on unifying all stipulations on 
managing various charges and fees throughout the entire country, 
and must strictly ban public organs and civil servants from 
creating charges and fees beyond the stipulations in that 
decision. 
  The Ministry of Finance is responsible for cooperating with 
relevant organs in providing uniform guidance for the system of 
management for each item of charges and fees. 
  5. At the sites where documents, papers, and complaints from 
the people are received and resolved, all stipulations on 
procedures for resolving every kind of works must be openly 
posted after these stipulations have been examined, revised, and 
supplemented by various ministries and sectors in accordance 
with the above spirit. 
  The different sorts of work must be clearly defined and the 
state organs responsible must complete it. If there are 
regulations for the collection of charges and fees, they must 
also be publicly announced. 
  Government officials charged with the duties of contacting 
and dealing with the public, and receiving documents must be 
qualified, honest, earnest. They must carry identification 
cards bearing their full name and rank. They are only allowed 
to resolve the work at the office. 
  When receiving papers requesting the resolution of a piece 
of 
work from the public, they must issue acknowledgement notes with 
the answering date. A piece of work that has met all 
requirements must be quickly approved according to the law and 
must not be delayed in any fashion. Clear reasons must be 
stated in response to applications that cannot be approved. If 
an application does not meet all the requirements, practical 
guidance must be given so that the applicant does not have to 
come back too many times. The head of an organ must outline 
regulations dealing with any case that involves many sections of 
the same organ, so that when any citizen and organization needs 
to apply for something, they only need to see one official who 
is charged with the duty of receiving the application and 
dealing with the case. 
  6. People who lodge their applications have the right to 
complain to the head of the receiving office or the head of a 
higher organ. They can also bring government officials to court 
for their mistakes, and incorrect action that cause them 
inconvenience when proper administrative procedure are not 
observed and if they behave in an authoritarian, insolent, and 
demanding manner. 
  Any head of state organs and government officials who 
violate 
state regulations when dealing with the public must be 
disciplined quickly and correctly. This must begin with their 
removal from present duties. On the other hand, it is necessary 
to deal lawfully with people who take advantage of the right to 
complain to cause disorder and taint the reputation of 
government officials and state organs. 
  7. To quicken the reexamination of current administrative 
procedures; the introduction of new regulations; and the 
supplement, adjustment, and cancellation of certain 
administrative procedures; the Government Office is entrusted 
with the duty of coordinating with all sectors in organizing and 
soliciting opinions from state organs and mass organizations. 
This will be done for outdated or illegal administrative 
procedures that inconvenience public organs, units, and the 
people. It will also affect those with loopholes, which bad 
people can take advantage of. No postage is needed for letters 
sent by public organs, units, and the people to the Government 
Office contributing views on administrative procedures that need 
to changed or abrogated. The Government Office is responsible 
for compiling and categorizing the suggestions before informing 
related ministries and sectors for action. 
  8. The minister of the Government Office is to coordinate 
with the chairman of the Government Organization and Personnel 
Commission, the minister of justice, and the chairman of the 
State Inspector Commission in helping the prime minister 
instruct all sectors and localities to execute this resolution. 
It is suggested that the central offices of mass organizations 
and the mass media closely coordinate with ministries, central 
sectors, and people's committees at all levels to widely 
publicize the aforementioned line to solemnly and efficiently 
execute this regulation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Japan Making Informal Contacts With </F>
U.S. in Search of Clues to Resumption of Stalled Japan-U.S. 
Economic Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has changed 
his hard-ine attitude toward Japan. On 10 May, Mr. Kantor spoke 
highly of measures the Japanese Government has taken for 
individual sectors. In response, the Japanese Government is 
paying attention to his attitude change. The issue of reforming 
the current tax system is the key to resuming the stalled 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but it remains unclear how 
the current tax system will be reformed. As the U.S. Government 
is showing "a notable change" in its response to measures taken 
by the Japanese Government, the Japanese Government will explore 
ways to resume the stalled framework talks before the Japan-U.S. 
summit talks scheduled for early July by making constant 
informal contacts with the U.S. Government through various 
channels. 
  What Japanese officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks are noticing is that since late April when the 
Hata government was inaugurated, the U.S. Government has begun 
showing a notable change. The U.S. trade representative decided 
to postpone imposing sanctions against Japan over the Japanese 
Government's procurement in accordance with the Omnibus Trade 
Act. During a 3 May television interview, President Clinton 
stated: "The United States will not seek a numerical market 
share or managed trade." During a 9 May telephone conversation 
with Prime Minister Hata, the President stressed the need for 
both Japan and the United States to work for resuming the 
stalled framework talks. 
  Commenting on the U.S. moves, Japanese officials in charge 
of 
the framework talks said: "The U.S. Government has made such 
moves out of consideration for the new government in Japan. The 
U.S. Government has been concerned with the dollar's devaluation 
and the drop in stocks and bonds prices. The mood may be 
building within the U.S. Government for a need to alter the 
hard-line trade policy toward Japan, which the U.S. trade 
representative has thus far upheld." A U.S. Government official 
visited Japan this week for a meeting with influential Japanese 
business leaders. During the meeting, he told the Japanese 
business leaders: "I hope you will visit Washington. If you 
visit, then you will find how the U.S. Government has changed 
its trade stance toward Japan." 
  Commenting on the change in the U.S. trade stance toward 
Japan, a senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] official welcomed the change by saying: "I assume the 
U.S. Government has realized at long last that no matter how 
hard it pressures Japan, it cannot wring concessions from its 
demands for numerical targets." MITI even goes so far as to 
say: "The focal point of individual sectors has reached a point 
where the two countries will have to reach a set of agreements 
which will allow the United States to save face." 
  A Japanese official in charge of the framework talks, said: 
During the informal contacts with the Japanese Government, "The 
U.S. Government has consistently expressed the hope that Japan 
will do something with its macroeconomic policy." The Hata 
government holds a minority in the Diet and this makes it 
unclear how the Hata government will formulate a macroeconomic 
policy aimed at reforming the current tax system and adding the 
planned amount for public works projects at the end of June. 
There are no wide differences between Japan and the United 
States over macroeconomic policy. American officials, who attach 
importance to macroeconomic policy, are gaining influence in the 
U.S. Government. This development will serve as a positive 
factor in resuming the stalled framework talks. 
  It can be said that a climate has been created for resuming 
the stalled framework talks during a time when the Japanese 
Government has continued to do nothing because of political 
turmoil. A senior Foreign Ministry official, however, makes a 
wary response to U.S. Government moves by saying: "Basically, 
the Clinton administration pursues a trade-result policy. I 
wonder whether the U.S. Government has really made a `notable 
change' in its trade stance toward Japan. We need to be sure 
the areas of agreement have actually surfaced between Japan and 
the United States. Once the framework talks have been resumed, 
it will be impermissible for the two countries to break them off 
again." 
  During the April meeting with (then) Foreign Minister Hata, 
U.S. Trade Representative Kantor set three conditions for 
resuming the stalled framework talks, which included: 1) a 
macroeconomic policy, 2) overall targets for opening the 
Japanese market, and 3) establishment of an objective criteria. 
For the time being, the Japanese Government will notify the 
U.S. Government of its responses to the three conditions through 
the informal contacts and then seek responses from the U.S. 
Government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Current-Account Surplus -- Stop the Vicious </F>
Cycle of Recession and High Yen"] 
  [Text] Both Japan's current-account surplus and the trade 
surplus (on a dollar basis) in 1993 were record-breakers. 
Japan's surpluses stand out among industrialized nations, but 
the country has a problem in ridding itself of economic 
recession. What we see is a vicious cycle of surpluses causing 
the high yen, the high yen worsening the recession, and then the 
recession increasing the surpluses. 
  On top of that, there is the worldwide trend for decline of 
the dollar, and there are now growing apprehensions that the yen 
will go up further. On 4 May, led by the U.S. Treasury 
Department, central banks of about a dozen nations decided to 
collaborate in dollar-buying money market interventions to put a 
stop to the fall of the dollar. 
  The Clinton administration has in the past accepted the 
conditions of the cheap dollar and the high yen as a way of 
pushing for correction of the imbalance in the trade surplus, 
but this time the U.S. administration made clear that it is 
changing that policy. The administration has also made its 
position clear that the excessivly low evaluation of the dollar 
does not serve the national interests. To look back on the 
times when the U.S. monetary authorities made active market 
interventions, there has hardly been an instance of the markets 
being impervious to such treatment. 
  Many market observers think the U.S. authorities' shift of 
policy this time is working as a brake on the dollar's 
minicrisis. The U.S. authorities have apparently determined 
that the high yen and the high [German] mark will work adversely 
against the Japanese and European economies and this can 
boomerang against the U.S. economy. We hope this will become an 
opportunity for countries to have better policy coordination. 
  The Hata government should make the most of this amicable 
atmosphere in policy cooperation and deal with the high yen 
problem by making active interventions in the market. 
  The current-account surplus may be at the highest level 
ever, 
but changes are being seen in the basic tone of the expanding 
surplus. There is the definite trend of the export volume 
decreasing and the import volume rising. Exporters are coming 
to find it increasingly difficult to fill up high-yen-caused 
gaps in income by passing cost pressures on to local 
dollar-based prices. The growth rate of the surplus is slowing 
as well. There are many signs which suggest that the high yen 
cycle that started in 1990 is coming to an end. 
  With all this happening, what the government should do now 
is 
come up with a daring surplus reduction target, and announce it 
to the world. It may be only an endeavour target, but still if 
it can help reverse the trend for the high yen soon, it surely 
will have served as an effective economic measure. When a 
target is set only to respond to pressure from the United 
States, the effect of it will diminish by half. 
  The government must push for and carry out deregulation 
daringly, and must show the world that it is serious about 
reform of the economic and social structure. 
  Meanwhile, there are excessive reactions in the money 
markets 
to the worldwide trend for the cheap dollar. The U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board (FRB) in early February started taking the 
precautionary action of raising the short-term interest rates to 
prevent overheated economic conditions from causing inflation. 
  It is said that U.S. long-term interest rates are reacting 
to 
these actions, causing prices of stocks and bonds to fall, and 
leading even the dollar to fall in the exchange market. There 
is now concern that there will be another Black Monday like we 
saw seven years ago. 
  But as yet we do not see any indications that the U.S. 
economy will actually plunge into inflation, and we do not see 
any reason to expect long-term interest rates to keep on rising. 
  Compared with seven years ago, conditions are different; 
take 
the cooperative relationship among the monetary authorities for 
instance. There was a major rift between the United States and 
Germany at that time. There remains the question of whether the 
U.S. financial deficit condition will really improve, but we 
hope the Clinton government will succeed with its health-care 
system reform and other programs. 
  It looks like the German economy has hit bottom, and that 
European interest rates have stopped falling. It is probably 
true that the world's interest rates have bottomed out. It is 
not so rare to see the markets rocking in a transitional period 
like this. 
  Being in such times, Japan and the United States need to 
have 
closer cooperation. The two countries should forget all that 
has passed, and resume the Japan-U.S. economic consultations 
without delay. It will serve as a good message to the markets.

<F P=106> [MAINICHI SHIMBUN interview with Masayoshi Takemura, head of </F>
Sakigake [Harbinger]; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the Hata 
administration? 
  [Takemura] Both Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito 
have come to the front, which makes it difficult for the 
well-rounded Tsutomu Hata to display his personal coloring. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The withdrawal of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the governing coalition was triggered 
by the formation of a new alliance called "Kaishin" [Innovation]. 
  [Takemura] The claim that under the single-seat constituency 
system the ruling coalition parties must be unified had come to 
the surface since the latter half of the Hosokawa 
administration. They tried all possible means, such as the 
formation of another new party [shin-shinto], a parliamentary 
alliance, a policy study group, a basic problems council, 
"Kaikaku" [Reform] and "Kaishin." We had the impression that 
their way of doing things was rough and we could side with them. 
A glance into the formation of Kaishin shows that they lack 
reflection. Their contention that the continued existence of 
the powerful Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] across the river 
necessitates the unification of anti-LDP forces leads to the 
preservation and encouragement of the LDP forces despite the 
fact that a political realignment terminating the 1955 system 
has already begun. A bold political realignment, including the 
LDP, should be implemented. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your stance toward the 
administration led by Shinseito? 
  [Takemura] We cooperate with the present administration from 
the outside. We cannot become an opposition party until a 
budget bill and other related bills submitted by the Hosokawa 
administration are passed. We will make our judgment after a 
close watch on the policies of the new administration and on its 
method of implementing them. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the basic policies 
of the ruling coalition parties? 
  [Takemura] We are generally in favor of the coalition 
parties, because their fundamental idea is based on the 
continuity of reform. However, serious problems are lurking in 
their security measures and their policy toward North Korea. 
The word "universal security" they used sounds like collective 
security advocated by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. 
That idea is a big logical jump from the past governmental view 
that "collective security is doubtful from the standpoint of the 
Constitution of Japan." The statement that "Japan will actively 
participate in the peacemaking activities of the United Nations" 
could be construed to mean that "peacemaking activities" include 
the dispatch of peacekeeping forces or even peace-enforcement 
forces. Why was the word "keeping" left out? Concerning the 
North Korea issue, it is stated that "if the United Nations 
adopts a policy, Japan will follow it," which could be construed 
to mean Japan will follow it unconditionally. Former Prime 
Minister Hosokawa replied to parliamentary interpellations that 
"if the United Nations adopts a resolution, Japan will cooperate 
with it within the limits of the Constitution." Compared with 
Hosokawa's reply, the current coalition parties have taken a 
rather bold step, saying that "Japan will follow even the policy 
of the United Nations." 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your view on the behavior of 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa? 
  [Takemura] He is a tough man. I have a feeling that he 
is a little hasty. Everyone makes a mistake. If a man makes a 
mistake, he should examine himself and make a fresh start, but 
Ozawa does not do so. He just dashes forward repeatedly with 
great vigor, and it is difficult for us to grow accustomed to 
such behavior. The basic principle of democracy is to recognize 
the existence of different opinions and to coexist with them. 
Ozawa's behavior has left a deep sense of incompatibility in 
the political world. Some criticize the existence of a dual 
power structure. The Hosokawa administration should have 
essentially reflected on the activities of the secretary 
generals meeting of the coalition parties, and the idea of the 
national welfare tax was symbolic of their activities. If the 
ruling coalition parties band together, they can encircle the 
LDP and win an overwhelming victory over it. There is a 
possibility that a one-party administration or the 
administration of one-party plus something will come into being. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration will face great 
difficulty in conducting state affairs. 
  [Takemura] The government and the ruling parties will settle 
the tax reform issue in June. However, since there is no 
guarantee that the Diet will pass the tax reform bill presented 
by some political parties, the United States will be 
distrustful. Since the basic principle of democracy is decision 
by the majority, a minority government will not last long. Both 
Shinseito and Komeito will contrive to gain a majority by luring 
some Dietmen from the LDP and the SDPJ. If they fail to do so, 
there are no prospects for them. Then, they have no alternative 
but to start over again. However, if the electoral 
redistricting panel can draw up an electoral redistricting bill 
through an extension of the Diet session, we had better aim at 
the passage of the bill. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Are you thinking of forming a 
parliamentary alliance with the SDPJ? 
  [Takemura] We will act in concert with the SDPJ, but that 
does not mean we will form an alliance with them. Before the 
upcoming election, we intend to form new, firm political forces 
ranging from the LDP to the SDPJ. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your political idea? 
  [Takemura] The protection of the Constitution has become a 
word that connotes a specific color. We are thinking of using 
the the word "chiken" [the appreciation of the Constitution] or 
the word "kakken" [the revitalization of the Constitution], but 
we have not found a proper word yet. We want to publish our 
party platform, because we will soon greet the first anniversary 
of our party. We want to fly a flag which is appealing to a 
wide circle of people.

<F P=106> ["Perilous War Gamble Against North" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The combined military 
exercises of the three services of the puppet army launched by 
the South Korean puppets on May 9 under the name of "combined 
tactical exercises for the first half of the year" are aimed at 
rounding off the posture of attack on the North according to the 
war policy of the U.S. imperialists, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary today. 
  The news analyst points out: 
  The puppets, as they customarily do, are now advertising the 
war game as designed to cope with "a surprise attack" and 
"infiltration" of the North. But this is no more than a sophism 
to cover up their bellicose nature in aggravating the situation 
on the Korean peninsula on purpose and seeking only 
confrontation and war. 
  It is the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmaniacs 
who scheme a surprise attack and infiltration on the Korean 
peninsula. The South Korean puppets in league with the United 
States have worked out "new operational plan 5027", designed to 
unleash a war against the North. The United States has massed 
huge aggression forces in and around South Korea and deployed 
Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea to 
inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation. Some time 
ago Defense Secretary Perry, the war boss of the U.S., flew to 
South Korea to have war confabs. 
  The United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must 
know that the dangerous play with fire driving the situation on 
the Korean peninsula to the brink of war will bring nothing good 
to them.

  [Text] The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets 
conducted a war exercise for a northward invasion and aerial 
espionage. 
  According to military sources, on 10 and 11 May, the U.S. 
imperialists dragged fighter bombers carrying nuclear weapons, 
pursuit-assault planes, early-warning planes, and refueling 
planes from its overseas bases into South Korea and conducted a 
provocative aerial war exercise aimed at a northward invasion. 
  The war exercise was composed of a surprise attack on 
targets 
on the ground, support for ground attack, an attack in the air, 
and airborne operations. Mobilized intensively for this war 
exercise were airplane squadrons from U.S. bases in the Pacific 
area and some 560 fighter bombers, assault planes, observation 
planes, reconnaissance planes, and armed helicopters of the U.S. 
occupation Air Forces in South Korea and the puppet air force. 
  This war exercise was conducted mainly in the skies above 
Tokchok island, Yoju, Umsong, and Kuri under the command of E-3 
early-warning planes known as aerial flight command post. Under 
the system of this war exercise, the KC-135's were refueling in 
the air the airplane squadrons flying from overseas bases into 
the South Korean skies. 
  This war exercise, which was conducted for two days 
according 
to the operations planned by the Pacific-based U.S. Air Force 
and Naval Headquarters, was a commotion of fire game 
[pulchangnan sodong] aimed at examining the actual combat 
capability of making a surprise attack for a northward invasion 
in cooperation with airplane squadrons from overseas bases, the 
U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea, and the puppet air 
force. 
  In the meantime, E-3 early-warning planes flew from overseas 
bases into the South Korean skies every day in the period from 6 
to 11 May to command airplane squadrons mobilized to war 
exercises for a northward invasion as well as to carry out 
electronic reconnaissance. 
  On 11 May, an RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane moved out 
from an Okinawa base into the South Korean skies and carried out 
electronic reconnaissance on areas in the northern half of the 
Republic while flying for a long time in the skies above Tokchok 
island, Uijongbu, Yanggu, and Kansong. 
  Encouraged by the U.S. imperialists, the South Korean 
puppets 
were frenzied in firing guns and increasing armed troops in an 
area adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  The puppets mobilized and deployed a large-caliber gun unit 
in an area near Myongho-ri, Kosong County, Kangwon Province on 
11 May, and dragged military vehicles carrying hundreds of armed 
rascals into an area near Mago-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi 
Province that day. 
  Prior to this, on 10 May, after occupying firing positions 
at 
Kumpa-ri in Paju County and Chokko-ri in Yonchon County, tank 
units and large-caliber artillery units of the puppet army fired 
some 50 bombs at areas adjacent to the MDL in the DMZ. Another 
group of puppet army's armed rascals that occupied at Pangmok-ri 
in Paju County fired some 500 shots of large-caliber machine 
guns and automatic rifles at random, while making a raid toward 
the MDL. 
  The South Korean puppets' planned war exercise commotion 
that 
is conducted everyday is a grave challenge to detente and peace 
on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] According to a Foreign Ministry report, at 1230 
yesterday Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri, who 
is on an official visit to the UK at the invitation of his UK 
counterpart Douglas Hurd, and his party paid a courtesy call on 
British Prime Minister John Major. The meeting was cordial and 
proceeded in friendly atmosphere based on the long-standing good 
relations between the two countries. They exchanged views on 
issues of mutual interest, particularly bilateral trade and 
investment which has expanded a great deal in the past year and 
its great potential. 
  The British prime minister stressed the interest and 
importance the UK gives to the nations in Asia and the Pacific, 
a region with high economic growth, particularly Thailand. He 
pledged to encourage UK businessmen to do more business in 
Thailand. 
  As the Thai foreign minister is the current chairman of the 
ASEAN Standing Committee, the UK prime minister felt that 
cooperation between ASEAN and the EU could be closer. The two 
sides also discussed antinarcotics cooperation as the narcotics 
problem in the UK has become more acute. They expressed 
satisfaction with their existing cooperation in education, 
training, and information and equipment exchanges. They also 
discussed regional security issues, including the Cambodian 
problem and hope the Cambodian factions would be able to resolve 
their problem in the interest of peace and stability in that 
country. 
  The fact that the UK has arranged a meeting between the 
foreign minister and its prime minister demonstrates the UK's 
awareness of Thailand's role and importance in the Asia-Pacific 
political arena. 
  After the meeting with the UK prime minister, Prasong, the 
Thai Foreign Ministry permanent secretary, and other Foreign 
Ministry officials had a meeting with senior UK Foreign Office 
officials. In attendance was also a group of UK 
parliamentarians and businessmen. 
  Later, the foreign minister also granted an interview to the 
BBC on topics such as ties between Thai and post-election South 
Africa, the Cambodian problem, and Burma's attendance at the 
ASEAN ministerial meeting. After the interview, the foreign 
minister attended a dinner hosted by the UK foreign minister at 
his office.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor agreed 
Friday night that the two countries should seek to resume the 
failed trade framework talks before the summit meeting of Group 
of Seven (G-7) major industrialized powers in Naples in July, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Meanwhile, a senior Trade Ministry official indicated that 
subcabinet-level trade talks will resume next week. 
  In a 15-minute telephone call, Kantor agreed with Kakizawa 
that Japan and the U.S. should create a basis for the resumption 
of the framework talks before the G-7 summit meeting in July, 
the officials said. 
  The two also agreed that Tokyo and Washington should hold 
unofficial contacts on the matter as early as possible, they 
said. 
  Kakizawa, who made the phone call to have his first 
conversation with Kantor since assuming the post in late April, 
told Kantor he thinks it important to establish a relationship 
of personal trust between them, they said. He also pointed out 
the importance of Japan-U.S. ties, especially in the economic 
field, they said. 
  Kantor was quoted as saying he agrees that personal trust is 
important. 
  Japan and the U.S. failed to reach agreement on the trade 
framework talk in February when then Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa met U.S. President Bill Clinton, failing to narrow 
differences over the definition of the previously agreed 
"objective criteria" to be used to gauge progress in the opening 
of Japan's markets. 
  The senior official at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry said earlier on condition of anonymity that Japan 
and the U.S. will resume subcabinet-level framework talks next 
week if a new proposal to break the deadlock wins the approval 
of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  The Japanese trade negotiators to be sent to Washington are 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international 
affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for 
economic affairs. 
  Trade Minister Eijiro Hata told a morning press conference 
that the top-level officials will not carry with them any 
specific answers to three new U.S. proposals made as conditions 
for resuming the framework talks. 
  Washington has asked Japan to clarify its position on 
macroeconomic policy, the overall goal of the framework talks 
and the "objective criteria" sought by the U.S. to assess 
progress in Japanese efforts for opening its markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
are set to resume their stalled talks on a new trade framework, 
with Tokyo slated to send top-level officials to Washington as 
early as next week. International Trade and Industry Minister 
Eijiro Hata told a morning press conference Friday that the 
officials will not carry with them any specific answers to three 
new U.S. proposals made as a condition for resuming the 
framework talks. 
  Washington has asked Japan to clarify its position on 
macroeconomic policy, the overall goal of the framework talks 
and the "objective criteria" sought by the United States to 
assess progress in opening Japan's markets. 
  A senior ministry official suggested the Japanese 
negotiators 
will tell their U.S. counterparts of Tokyo's willingness to take 
action to broaden foreign access to goods procured by the 
government. "There is room for study in the case of government 
procurement, which is under the government's jurisdiction," the 
official said on condition of anonymity. 
  Government procurement is one of the three areas to which 
Washington gives top priority in the framework talks. But the 
official said the two sides are likely to run into rough going 
in trying to define the goal of the bilateral talks initiated by 
the U.S. to pry open Japanese markets and rectify the chronic 
trade imbalance between the two countries. 
  Japanese and U.S. negotiators are in agreement not to go 
into 
details on "objective criteria" as sought by Washington but 
rejected by Tokyo, which led the talks to collapse at the summit 
meeting in Washington in February. 
  A U.S. diplomat has said it seems that U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor will not stick to his effort to pin 
down objective criteria by any means if Tokyo promises to widen 
U.S. access to Japanese markets on a sector-by-sector basis. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is scheduled to talk with 
Kantor later in the day by telephone for their first 
conversation since Kakizawa took office in late April. The 
issue of how to deal with the framework talks is expected to be 
on the agenda in the telephone talks. 
  The Japanese trade negotiators to be sent to Washington are 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister of international trade and 
industry for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy 
foreign minister for economic affairs.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
pledged Friday [13 May] that his government will adopt "perfect 
measures" to defend Japan's security if military conflict broke 
out on the Korean peninsula. 
  "If a serious contingency broke out, the government will 
counteract it with intragovernment solidarity and adopt perfect 
measures," he said in reply to an opposition query on a security 
threat from Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Hata was fielding a Diet interpellation from Takushi Hirai, 
a 
Liberal Democratic Party member, who pressed Hata to clarify 
Japan's response to U.S. requests to halt banking and cash 
remittance to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in 
Japan. 
  Hirai also pressed Hata to clarify whether the government 
would deploy Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force in times of a 
possible U.N. resolution to impose a naval blockade against 
North Korea to penalize it for its refusal to accept unimpeded 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  Hata refused to rule out possible Japanese participation 
into 
these sanction measures. 
  "Now that the international community is quietly pressing 
North Korea to open its window (to the inspection demand), I 
would like to avoid specifying (Japan's possible response to the 
contingency)," Hata said. 
  Hata later straddled the fence in the face of persistent 
opposition questions on whether Japan is ready to use forces to 
help its allies impose sanctions against North Korea if the 
international community moved to slap sanctions. 
  He said, "Although Japan is endowed by international laws 
with the right to use force to block a military offensive to a 
foreign country with a close tie with Japan, Japan's exercise of 
(its right to) collective security would overstep the boundary 
of the Constitution." 
  The premier rejected the allegation that his administration 
is trying to alter postwar governments' longtime constitutional 
interpretation that the Constitution bans Japan's involvement in 
collective security. 
  The coalition government "will firmly stick to the longtime 
interpretation that Japan is authorized to use only minimum 
necessary forces under the Article 9 of the Constitution," he 
said. 
  He made the remarks in response to questions from Social 
Democratic Party elder Koken Nosaka and new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Takemura pressed Hata to clarify the definition of the 
controversial phrase "universal security" that was incorporated 
into coalition parties' common policy document, inked by their 
leaders April 22 as a prerequisite for initiating the fresh 
coalition government. 
  The policy platform document says coalition parties 
"recognize the fact that the Japanese Constitution adopts as its 
ideal universal security to be ensured by the United Nations." 
  Hata replied, "universal security implies...U.N. actions for 
ensuring security that include measures provided for by the 
chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, taken in solidarity by the 
international community to counteract an invasion by a destroyer 
of peace." 
  The chapter 7 has been under Diet scrutiny, as it 
authorizes, 
among others, military actions including a blockade by military 
forces to restore peace in conflict-marred regions. 
  The SDP's Nosaka blasted Hata for defending former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano who resigned last Saturday after calling 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication." 
  Nosaka was taking issue with Hata's remark that "Mr. Nagano 
is a man of excellent character and profound knowledge." 
  Hata said, "although Japan has sincerely dealt with the war 
reparation issue in the San Francisco treaty and bilateral 
treaties...I will consider how Japan can demonstrate its 
feelings of repentance and reflection (on Japan's World War II 
campaign.)"

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Monitoring the Unrestricted"] </F>
  [Text] The much-awaited investment law which allows a 
transfer of foreign currencies abroad, sent signals of 
Cambodia's warm welcome to investors. 
  Seen as one of Cambodia's bid to woo investors, funds may be 
remitted freely out of the country. 
  Even investors who do not export their goods or services and 
deal solely in local currency are entitled to the benefits of 
this regulation, as they can convert their revenue into foreign 
currencies without restriction. 
  But there is a need for the legislation, when passed, to be 
backed by strong legislative support pertaining to the 
definition of investment returns which can be remitted home. 
  If there was a strong need for legislative support, there is 
a more urgent note to provide a framework within which the 
transfer of investment will work. 
  In Cambodia, the responsibility lies with two bodies to 
perform these functions. They are the National Assembly and 
Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC). 
  CDC, a regulatory body set up to study and make 
recommendations on investments and development, is presided over 
by the First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. 
  Its main function is to advise investors, define incentives 
that investors are entitled to, grant them approval and very 
quickly check any questions that the investors might invoke. 
  With CDC, the bulk of responsibility of administration and 
bureaucracy will generally be taken away from ministries and be 
delegated to the organisation to function as a "one-stop 
investment service" centre. 
  Therefore, CDC should take the initiative to carefully 
structure a set of rules to act as a guide to investors on dos 
and don'ts. 
  This is the time to put Cambodia's house in order. There is 
no point in crying over spilt milk and making amends after going 
wrong. 
  This is especially important as CDC will also serve as the 
industry and trade justice council. 
  If CDC can lead the way in putting order to Cambodia's 
economy, it will not only benefit the country, but also lend 
credibility to the organisation.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 12 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister 
Ali Alatas said Thursday an incident experienced by 41 
indonesians on a pilgrimage to a Catholic shrine in Portugal 
recently was "a matter of great regret." 
  "I am just surprised why the local security authorities had 
not foreseen the possibility and taken steps to prevent such an 
incident," the minister said after arrival at Sukarno-Hatta 
airport from a tour of Eastern Europe, Geneva, and South Africa. 
  "If this is the way Portugal welcomes Indonesians visiting 
Portugal under the mutually agreed `confidence-building 
measures' (CBM), we would not have so readily agreed to taking 
them (the CBM)," he said . 
  Indonesia and Portugal agreed in New York three years ago 
that they would work towards a comprehensive settlement of their 
dispute over East Timor by first engaging in so-called 
"confidence-building measures" which included promotion of 
informal community-to-community contacts between East Timorese 
in East Timor and those living in Portugal. 
  Indonesian ambassador for special tasks Lopez Da Cruz who 
led 
41 Indonesian pilgrims from East Timor upon arriving at Lisbon 
Airport on Tuesday (9/6), had been "attacked" by some 
irresponsible Portuguese. 
  The delegation is in Portugal to make a religious visit to 
the holy shrine of Fatimah. 
  Alatas said that Indonesia had always been supporting 
conducive dialogs that would lead to the settlement of the East 
Timor issue, among others, by implementing the CBM through 
"people-to-people contacts". 
  He said the Indonesian people and government had warmly 
welcomed the visit of 25 East Timorese living in Portugal. 
  On the result of the tripartite meeting among Indonesia, 
Portugal and United Nations [UN] on the East Timor issue held in 
Geneva on May 6, Alatas said that the meeting had agreed on 
taking "progressive steps". 
  "We mentioned some programs that we have implemented in line 
with the CBM," he said adding that Indonesia also agreed to 
additional CBM. 
  Alatas said that the U.N secretary general welcomed the 
London meeting that involved East Timorese figures living abroad 
with their counterparts living in Indonesia. 
  The UN secretary general would like to see Indonesia and 
Portugal expand their dialogs by involving more groups that had 
so far not yet joined the reconciliation dialogs. 
  Both foreign ministers agreed to "take note" of the UN 
secretary general's wish which means that they "neither support 
nor reject the proposal", Alatas said. 
  He said that Indonesia, in principle, does not reject a 
meeting that will involve groups of East Timorese, as long as 
the meeting is based on the spirit of reconciliation, 
non-political in nature, and formally dialogic between two 
communities that have been separated for a much prolonged time. 
  Alatas said that Indonesia would only use the tripartite 
meeting to achieve a political settlement of the East Timor 
issue. 
  A settlement process mediated by the U.N would be the only 
formal dialog, he said, adding that the crux of a solution to 
the East Timor issue remained to be "in the UN's pocket". 
  "The U.N still terms East Timor as a non-self governing 
territory and Portugal is termed as the administering power, and 
therefore we are still being the accused," he added. 
  People-to-people contact may still continue as the channel, 
he said, while rejecting the idea to make it as the first 
channel for the two countries to settle the issue. 
  He said that it was not necessary for both foreign ministers 
as well as the secretary general to take part in such a second 
channel, adding that any involvement of the three camps will 
make the channel become formal. 
  "Let the process go on naturally, the three camps should 
refrain from taking part in it," he added. 
  He said that the recent tripartite meeting also resulted in 
the Portugal foreign minister's readiness to hold talks with 
East Timorese that support the integration. 
  On the other hand, Alatas will also be ready to hold talks 
with groups of people that are against the integration. 
  "Ways and forms of dialogs will be up to both of the foreign 
ministers," he said. 
  Alatas said that he is ready to talk with anti-integration 
groups provided that they do not represent any organization or 
institution. 
  The next tripartite meeting will be held sometime in January 
next year. 
  Alatas said that the next tripartite meeting will discuss 
the 
core of the issue and step up to the exchange of views on the 
settlement of the issue.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- live; 
passages within slantlines in Tagalog] 
  [Text] [Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Hi, Mr. President. 
This afternoon, we have the officers of the National Press Club 
and the new officers of the Philippine Press Institute [PPI]. 
They will take their oath before you later after the press 
conference. 
  [Ramos] Good afternoon officials of the National Press Club. 
Would you rather have the press con [conference] first or would 
you rather have the induction and the inauguration ahead? 
[response from the correspondents] Press con /first/, so you 
are first and foremost journalist and reporters. 
  Yes, in connection with my directive to the acting secretary 
of the Department of Interior and Local Government yesterday to 
go as deeply and as comprehensively as possible into the 
killings arising out of the /village/ elections. And when I 
wrote that directive yesterday, there were 26 that have been 
reported killed already including two Comelec [Commission on 
Elections] officials, and today the report is 30. 
  I wanted to make sure that these killings and its incident 
of 
violence would be thoroughly investigated so that we could get 
to the truth of the matter. And for the investigators, the 
police in collaboration with the Comelec, the DND [Department of 
National Defense], AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines], and 
the Department of Justice and NBI [National Bureau of 
Investigation] would be able to build up its case that would 
lead to a successful prosecution and the conviction of the 
guilty as maybe warranted by the evidence. 
  I think it's about time that we reverse this culture of 
violence connected with elections. And that in our country as 
in any other democratic representative country, that people 
don't have to kill or get killed in order to succeed into a 
political office. We have many bitter lessons of the past which 
I suppose were part of our maturing into what we are now -- a 
functioning democracy -- based on people power, based on the 
decision of the majority of the electorate. And after many 
years of bloodletting, I think that situation should now be 
reversed, and present ourselves to the world as a mature, as a 
democratic, and as a peaceful society. And I would like to 
reiterate that message in the presence of the leaders of media 
who are here for a very special occasion. Okay? 
  [Sison] Questions? The members of the officers of the 
National Press Club and PPI may ask questions. [Laughter from 
Ramos] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, good afternoon Sir. 
  [Ramos] Good afternoon. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The NDF [National Democratic 
Front] has threatened to pull out from the peace process. Can 
we get your response about this, sir? 
  [Ramos] Well, so what's new? This isn't the first time they 
threatened to pull out of the peace process. But we have bent 
backwards to make sure that every opportunity is given to our 
long lost brothers and sisters who have (?thread) themselves out 
of the mainstream of our law-abiding society. And that 
opportunity is still there, the door is still open. And we are 
saying that many from the hills are taking advantage of our 
peace process and availing of our national reconciliation and 
development program so that they could again lead useful, 
productive, and join in the development of our country. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Follow-up, sir. When will be 
the peace talks to resume between the MNLF [Moro National 
Liberation Front] and the government? 
  [Ramos] We are awaiting word from the Indonesian Government 
because during the month of April when the talks, the second 
round of talks were scheduled, we were told that they had 
several state visitors. And that, maybe the month of May, or a 
little afterwards would be a better time. In any case, that is 
still very open. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the new 
value-added tax [VAT] law removes the exemption previously 
granted to the book and newspaper publishing industry. Now, 
with the additional imposition of the 10 percent tax on the 
newspaper industry in particular would just cause many 
newspapers to go (?under), to close shop. Is it possible under 
the terms of the law to ...for the president to suspend the 
effectivity of this particular provision? 
  [Ramos] We are studying right now the implementation of the 
expanded VAT law precisely in regard to deferments in general 
because the original VAT and this amendment to the VAT in effect 
removed from our revenue books some 75 or 80 impositions. And 
so, if you take action on one side, there is a counteraction or 
a possible negative effect on the other. But I think you should 
be assured that this expanded VAT law was studied over a very 
long period, over several months in both chambers including in 
the two panels of the house and the Senate in the conference 
committee. And the president has no choice in that case except 
to approve or veto. This is not like the General Appropriations 
Act where the president can line veto certain items. So, all of 
this is still under close study in regard to the so-called 
deferments. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President. 
  [Ellen Tordesillas] Sir, this morning you met with the Papal 
Nuncio and I understand he delivered a letter from Pope John 
Paul II. May we know what was the message from the Pope? 
  [Ramos] Well, at the moment that is still confidential. But 
it is connected with our support for family planning, which was 
discussed in the preliminary meeting at the United Nations in 
New York, to which meeting we sent a delegation headed by 
Secretary Flavier. 
  On the other hand, the Papal Nuncio also came and I think 
this is the most important message for all Filipinos, to assure 
us that the Pope is coming in January 1995 as scheduled in spite 
of his injury from which he is now fast recovering according to 
Archbishop Morene, the Papal Nuncio. And I understand that from 
Archbishop Morene that the Pope is now back at work. So these 
are very reassuring words for all of us. In fact I have just 
received from the central committee of the Philippine 
Preparatory Commission of the Catholic Bishops that there is 
already out in circulation this brochure [brochure shown to 
media people] which says the Pope in Manila 1995, and it says 
here, the Pope is coming to Manila to see you, to see all of us. 
  [Ellen] Sir, is this letter express concern over the 
...[pause] your government's population program? [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Ramos] No. 
  [Ellen) Sir, thank you. 
  [Correspondent identified only as Jake] Sir, just a 
follow-up 
question on the peace process. Attorney Veria, the spokesman of 
your party is seeking [changes thought] is recommending the 
release of Miss Tiamzon. 
  [Ramos] I think he was just expressing his opinion as a 
member of one of our peace panels. But, uh,...the PNP 
[Philippine National Police] should be given an opportunity to 
follow-up this case to its logical conclusion because after all 
we are merely following judicial processes under the rules of 
court. 
  [Jake] How do you find such opinion? 
  [Ramos] Pardon? 
  [Jake] How do you find the...do you think it's worth 
[question interrupted by Ramos]...? 
  [Ramos] As I said, that is his opinion, perhaps in his 
personal capacity as a member of one of the peace panels but not 
as a Lakas [Lakas ng Bansa -- Power of the Nation] spokesman. 
  [Jake] Thank you, sir. 
  [Ramos] After all, as president, and as president of all 
Filipinos, I need not follow the party line. But that is not 
the party line, I assure you. 
  [Correspondent identified only as Bobby] Good afternoon, Mr. 
President. 
  [Ramos] Good afternoon. 
  [Bobby] Yesterday you issued a directive to Customs 
Commissioner Parayno to follow-up the investigation on a certain 
Michael Que who was name-dropping at the airport last Friday 
after bringing in 1 million pesos worth of watches. There have 
been similar cases in the past of people dropping your name or 
any other government officials. How would you deal with such 
people and the officials helping them? 
  [Ramos] Well, the policy is there that I will not allow any 
such poseurs or influence peddlers to be using my name or that 
of the first lady or even that of the rest of the first family. 
But I'm still awaiting the report of the customs commissioner 
on this because we don't really know the circumstances, so we've 
asked them to look at this matter. 
  [Bobby] What about the other cases in the past, sir, when 
there were some people dropping your name, particularly at the 
airport? 
  [Ramos] First, there were investigations that were 
conducted. 
In the case that I recall in which an influence peddler was 
trying to pose as a party leader using an old campaign calendar 
that we were circulating during the campaign period with my 
signature on it, he was upon the investigation, found out to be 
using that for nefarious purposes. So the police took action. 
  [Bobby] Thank you, sir. 
  [Correspondent identified only as Mike] Good afternoon, Mr. 
President. 
  [Ramos] Good afternoon. 
  [Mike] How would you assess the ongoing peace initiative of 
government at this point in time? 
  [Ramos] We have taken a new initiative in the issuance of 
proclamation 347 and proclamation 348, which, as you already 
know were issued in late March, 25 March, to be submitted to 
Congress for ratification. And to their credit, Congress -- 
both houses -- are thoroughly engaged in consultations even in 
the countryside on the part of Senator Biazon to determine the 
people's reactions to these, including from among the possible 
beneficiaries. And we continue to work closely with those 
committees of Congress in order to maximize the chances of 
ratification. In general, that's the situation. 
  On the three fronts, the talks -- whether formal on the part 
of the military rebels and regard to the MNLF [Moro National 
Liberation Front] -- are continuing. Now, in regard to the CPP- 
NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army- 
National Democratic Front], we're still at the exploratory talks 
stage. But as I said we have kept the door open to give 
everybody the maximum opportunity to dialogue with the 
government. 
  [Mike] Sir, don't you think that the continued detention of 
Wilma Tiamzon will not hamper the peace initiative with the 
communist rebels? 
  [Ramos] Well, as I said, we must follow judicial processes. 
So, this states the government must hear to the law. The 
government must adhere to the judicial process that is there. 
After all, according to the police, there are existing warrants 
that must be served. 
  [Mike] Thank you, Sir. 
  [Correspondent identified only as Manny] Good afternoon, Mr. 
President. 
  [Ramos] Good afternoon. 
  [Manny) A top official of the House of Representatives said 
last week that the passage of the five landmark measures 
including the restructuring of the value-added tax would lead 
the freedom of this country from the influence of the IMF in 
three years time. Mr. President do you have, uh, do you agree 
with this assessment? 
  [Ramos] Well, there are still certain legislative actions to 
be taken. One of them is the proposed liberalization of the 
banking industry in the Philippines. This is one of the 
structural reforms that has to be put in place before we can 
really be considered by the international community as open, 
liberalized, and competitive with a level playing field for the 
economy to flourish. But I would like to make clear again, 
because we discussed this during previous meetings, that what we 
are doing is not because of any IMF imposition. We are doing 
this because this is what we see as the right direction for the 
Philippine economy, for the political leadership to take. 
  You will recall that the VAT law, for instance, originated 
back from the President Cory Administration. And the real VAT 
law was initiated as early as the first session of the 8th 
Congress in 1987 that became a law in 1988. And the economic 
stabilization program, into which we are still up to now, was 
initiated also about three years ago during the Cory 
Administration. But we have to see through all of these steps. 
So that we become really an open economy, not inward and 
protected, and import-looking kind of an economy. Because 
obviously the answer to the expansion of our economy and the 
sustained prosperity of our people in the future is to be into 
the export mode. 
  The economy must be export-led and investment-led, and 
tourism- led, instead of us importing all the time goods from 
other countries. So, this entire program that we are into would 
lead to sustainable development. But we must finish all of the 
various components of the structure so that we will be on a 
sustainable mode, otherwise, we will have this cycle of boom and 
bust, or up and down, or advance and retreat, as we experienced 
during the past several decades. But now we have the 
opportunity to do it. That's why we are pushing, and pushing 
together with the leaders of Congress and the leaders of the 
private sector. So that what we have been aspiring for for many 
years will finally happen. 
  [Manny] On another subject Mr. President. The first 
quarter of this year has seen the rise in heinous crimes in the 
city of Manila, including murders and bank robberies. Would you 
favor Mr. President a more police visibility, like fielding more 
police foot patrols and conducting saturation drives in 
crime-ridden areas? 
  [Ramos] Well, the answer is really a much more comprehensive 
package of actions than just what you are suggesting, although 
that is part of it. We have thoroughly discussed this with the 
law enforcement authorities during our recent national summit on 
peace and order at Camp Crame. The formula really involves the 
five pillars of the so-called criminal justice system: the 
police, the prosecution, the judiciary, the corrections, meaning 
the penology and Bureau of Prisons people. And the fifth is the 
community -- led by the governors and the mayors in their 
respective jurisdictions -- plus, the very dedicated 
participation of the concerned citizenry. So that is what it 
will take. But in regard to the current situation, as I already 
reported here, we have asked the Department of Interior and 
Local Government, which has jurisdiction over the police and 
local government units to take the lead and to be more thorough 
and to be more dedicated in getting into the investigation of 
all of the /village/ election-related violence. 
  Well, that is also true for the thorough investigation of 
the 
recent killing of Major Zarcal, of the Philippine National 
Police. And we must get to the bottom of that, we must get to 
the truth of the matter because, after all, Zarcal is one of 
their own. And they are now challenged to come up with a 
solution of the case and the apprehension of the killers, and 
for those killers to be brought before the bar of justice. But 
as I said, the entire anti-crime and peace and order effort 
requires the interaction and close collaboration of all of these 
five pillars of our criminal justice system. 
  [Manny] Thank you, Mr. President. 
  [Correspondent identified only as Jun] Good afternoon, Mr. 
President. This is a follow-up question to that of Mr. Yambot on 
the recently approved expanded value added tax. This concerns 
Mr. President the economics of media especially the struggling 
community press. 
  For the first time, Mr. President in all these years, 
newspapers will be taxed for the first time and that the 
broadcast will be taxed for the second time. If you will allow 
me to trace, Mr. President, the history, until the third to the 
last regime, all newspapers and radio broadcasting stations were 
exempted from any tax. During the second to the last regime, 
the newspapers were left untaxed but the broadcasting stations 
were taxed. Now, Mr. President, I wonder if you will allow 
under your regime, both electronics and the print media to be 
taxed. 
  [Ramos] As I said, I did not pass those laws, and I do not 
have the power of sectional or partial veto on these laws. But 
I'll be happy to receive your position from the various sectors 
of media. 
  By the way, there is a very revealing feature story authored 
by Senator Herrera -- the author on the part of the Senate -- of 
this expanded VAT law which explains what this law is all about. 
And I would suggest, before we start getting too unhappy or 
demoralized, that we refer to study this. It's a primer really, 
where he explains the facts and the myths about the VAT law, and 
there are nine particular issues that he deals with very, very 
thoroughly, and very objectively in my view. And so I would 
suggest that that would be a good reading for all of you. But 
at the same time, as I said, I would welcome your suggestions 
and proposals because after all, what Congress has put in place, 
they can also amend. That's all there is to it. But the 
executive cannot do something beyond what is in the law. 
  [Jun] Mr. President, section 17 of the law provides, 
empowers the president to exclude some sectors. 
  [Ramos] That's what I said in answer to Danny Yambot here, 
and that's why I'm saying that we welcome your suggestions so 
that we can input whatever your opinions are. It will be 
studied that one maybe. 
  [Jun] Thank you, Mr. President. 
  [Ramos] Thank you. 
  [Correspondent identified only as Vivian] Sir, a while ago 
you mentioned the killing of Police Major Zarcal. The ABB [Alex 
Boncayao Brigade] said its objective is to make government look 
helpless and ineffective in the face of crime and corruption as 
evidenced by their assassination of Zarcal and their threats to 
kidnap some government officials and make them publicly confess 
their corruption. What can you say about this, sir? 
  [Ramos] You know, the police's progress reports indicate 
that 
it is not necessarily the ABB that did the killing. That is not 
yet a conclusion on the part of the police, they are looking at 
other angles. Now, as to the ABB making all of these threats, 
well again, this is not new. They have been making all kinds of 
threats in the past. And they have always wanted to disrupt our 
society and the well being and peace of mind of our people. But 
again as I said in my remarks in regard to fighting crime and 
fighting lawlessness in our society, we must continue to be 
united in our actions and in our vigilance so that we can 
finally project to the world and to our own people that ours is 
a peaceful and law-abiding society, and not otherwise. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
  [Ramos] Good afternoon. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Yesterday or the other day, the 
Miss Universe candidates came to see you and again in around 
town. The game around town Mr. President is picking out at least 
three to five winners. May we know your choice? 
  [Ramos] You know, in my welcome remarks to the Miss 
Universe delegates, they are called delegates not contestants, 
because they are considered as ambassadors of goodwill. I said 
that I have retired from beauty judging back in 1973 because in 
that one time that I was invited to be a judge to a Miss 
Philippines contest, our choice, Margie Moran became Miss 
Universe that same year. So, after that I retired already from 
beauty judging. I said because I have a 20/20 vision and a 
1,000 percent batting average. So this time I pass, I pass. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Your 
Excellency. 
It seems that the Indonesians are unhappy over the reports that 
the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor is going to be held in 
Manila and there is a threat that the peace talks in Jakarta 
might be jeopardized. May we know your comment on this, Mr. 
President? 
  [Ramos] I would like you to know that there are certain 
things here that must be understood. Number one, we have been 
very concerned about this meeting which will be held in Manila. 
But this was upon the initiative of a private group over which 
the government has no control. And there have been 
consultations between the Philippine Government and the 
Indonesian Government at the highest levels. In fact, for your 
information, I tasked Vice President Estrada, who is now in 
South Africa to attend the inauguration of President Mandela, to 
confer with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia about this 
matter, and for Vice President Estrada to explain to the foreign 
minister of Indonesia that while we are concerned about the 
possible effect on Philippine-Indonesian relations of the 
hosting by a private group in the Philippines of this meeting, 
that it would be unconstitutional on our part to prevent such a 
meeting from taking place in the Philippines. 
  Secondly, however, I asked the vice president also to convey 
to our Indonesian friends through Foreign Minister Alatas that 
we feel that the strength of Philippine-Indonesia bilateral 
relations, as well as our relations as member nations under the 
brotherhood of ASEAN, is strong enough to withstand any such 
irritations as this may cause. 
  Now, I would like to add to all of that. That the 
Philippines considers that East Timor is and remains a part of 
Indonesia as its 37th province. This is the position we took a 
long time ago. I also would like to take the opportunity to 
again express our appreciation for the full and unstated support 
that Indonesia has been giving to our peace process, which have 
been most helpful in putting together the MNLF [Moro National 
Liberation Front] under Chairman Misuari and our Republic of the 
Philippines panel under Chairman Ambassador Yan. And that we 
will continue to be committed to maintaining those deep and 
strong ties with Indonesia. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President. 
  [Ramos] Now, let me add that there is a newspaper report. I 
think in one of the radio and TV stations and then entered in 
one of the evening paper last night, that a certain Carlos Forte 
is inviting Jose Maria Sison to come to the Philippines to join 
in that conference. And according to this report, they are to 
undertake some kind of a revolution. Well, that is one thing 
that we will not allow in the Philippines. Certainly we will 
prevent any such happening in the Philippines, meaning, for the 
two of them to get together in the Philippines to plant a 
revolution. But in any case that report still has to be 
verified. But it did come across my desk this morning and so 
I'm making that comment in relation to your question. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Sir. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] /Good afternoon, beloved 
president/. Sir, you did a lot of good changes in the previous 
sad experience of our country. /Through this village election 
held in your administration,/ will there be really a change, 
especially in our electoral processes, that there will be no 
more vote buying which has happened this previous /village/ 
election which lots of people fear might happen during the 
upcoming election. 
  [Ramos] /That's what I've said just a while ago/ and I'm 
glad you asked this question because my answer a while ago was: 
I hope we change our political culture, of depending on the gun 
and together with that would be goons and gold, because those 
are our perennial diseases in elections -- guns, goons, and gold. 
  We have to reverse that culture because we are now supposed 
to be a mature and functioning democracy that was created out of 
people power during the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] 
revolution of February 1986. And the whole world has been 
admiring this Philippine style of democracy. But there are 
other aspects of it that we must correct and change, and this 
matter of the use of force and money and economic or political 
influence where they should not be applied should also be 
changed. 
  So, I'm hopeful that we improve step by step. I consider 
these /village/ elections to be an improvement in that direction 
towards change. But we must get away from this belief that it 
is going to be the strongman, the warlord, the guy with the most 
money that always wins elections in our society. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, I just want to get your 
reaction, I do not create factionalism in our profession. But 
there is this news that came out that there is this 100,000 
pesos that Malacanang has distributed during this previous 
/village/ election which I really hate to hear because I know 
your administration, sir. 
  [Ramos] Thank you for again coming up with a question that 
has to be clarified. First of all, I deny any participation and 
I also deny for all of Malacanang. In regard to an alleged 
100,000 pesos fund given to the congressmen, the congressmen 
have their own funds in the House of Representatives also 
appropriated by Congress. We are accountable for the funds that 
are appropriated for us. So, why should I risk the good name 
and the prestige of Malacanang by disbursing funds just like 
that, for an election where there is supposed to be no 
partisanship, no expenditure by anybody outside of the 
/village/, other than what the Comelec [Commission on Elections] 
has to spend for. 
  [Joel Paredes] Good afternoon, sir. Sir, will the border 
agreement with Malaysia by January 1995 affect the Philippines' 
claim to Sabah? 
  [Ramos] Will you say that question again please? 
  [Paredes] Sir, will the border agreement with Malaysia by 
January 1995 affect the Philippines' claim to Sabah? 
  [Ramos] The border patrol agreement is still really in the 
process of negotiation, but we hope it will be agreed to as soon 
as possible. But that is just a border agreement. It also 
includes a joint patrol agreement in order that smuggling, 
illegal entry, drug trafficking, the trafficking of guns as well 
as wanted persons will be better controlled by both parties. As 
I mentioned to you in a previous press con, and I think you are 
also the one that asked the question, and my answer is still the 
same. We have pushed the Sabah claim in the back burners so to 
speak. And we are dealing right now with immediate problems of 
labor, illegal entry, border problems so that we can facilitate 
trade between our two countries especially at the border areas. 
  [Paredes] Sir, but will the Philippines still pursue its 
claim later, in the near future? 
  [Ramos] We have not abandoned the claim. But as I said, at 
the moment, we are attending to more pressing issues that will 
lead to the economic and social and political benefit of both 
countries. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon Mr. President 
and 
congratulations for your improved vision after that meeting with 
Miss Universe contestants. Anyway, Mr. President, in the 
presence of the gods of Philippine media, let me ask this 
question. Mr. President what is your perception or assessment 
of government and Philippine media relations, and your 
suggestions as to how this can be improved for the interest of 
the country, of course without waiving media's right, 
adversarial function as watchdog of Philippine society? 
  [Ramos] I think we are agreed that government relations with 
media and my own personal presidential relations with media are 
very good, but they could be better. 
  Did you not attend the gridiron put up by the National Press 
Club? As I said, we should have this gridiron once a month so 
that we will have a more frequent exposure to freedom of the 
press Ramos style. But levity aside, I welcome all of my 
encounters and opportunities to dialogue with media because 
that's the way government also has to operate. Government must 
be able to signal the correct messages to the public through 
media. And in this role, media to me is one of the most 
important pillars of our democracy, and one should not be 
isolated from the other. That's why I make it a point to always 
bring representatives of the Malacanang press corp as well as 
the gods of media with me when I make my trips; whether in 
country or abroad, even under water, they are invited to come 
with me. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you Mr. President and 
thank you for your donations to the National Press Club. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] My question Mr. President is of 
regional concern in Mindanao, because I come from Davao. On my 
way here last night, Father Barcelon who works in Cagayan says 
that there's a feeling that this East ASEAN thing, the growth 
polygon that's pushing in Mindanao which you have started going 
on is confined in Davao and that some regional centers there in 
Region IX and Region X feel that it's Davao getting all the 
action. And we noted that this month, we were told that you are 
going again to Davao three times, this month. And that might 
send wrong signal again to the other centers in Mindanao. What 
are really your plans Mr. President for Mindanao? 
  [Ramos] Well, I hope you do not see yourselves again in 
Mindanao as being a bunch of cities and provinces. We are 
looking at Mindanao. We are looking at the southern Philippines 
in fact, and that includes Cebu now and parts of Palawan as 
within this East ASEAN growth area. But we have to start 
somewhere and we have to make sure that when we start this, that 
is going to be very viable and is going to take off and is going 
to spark into the other parts of Mindanao and also other parts 
of the Philippines. 
  So, (?Mr.) Fr. Barcelon, for your prestigious media network, 
that we are really looking first at the corridor between Davao 
and General Santos City. But that there is a flagship project 
in each of the five regions in Mindanao and that includes the 
ARMM [Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao] and the flagship 
project there is the completion, the concreting of the Marawi to 
Cotabato City highway, to which we have assigned elements of two 
engineering brigades of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
And there in Northern Mindanao we have the (PHIVIDEC) 
[expansion unknown] Cagayan de Oro to Iligan corridor and this 
is already a well discussed development area for which we have 
already approved the master plan presented by the group chaired 
by Mayor Magtahas of Cagayan de Oro. And the opportunities for 
opening up that area are ongoing like the privatization of the 
National Steel Corporation in Iligan, concurrently with the 
studying of the proposals by the (PHIVIDEC) and by the National 
Steel Corp. and the National Development Corporation of the 
integrated steel mill in Cagayan de Oro for which we have 
already reserved some 500 hectares within the (PHIVIDEC) 
industrial state. 
  Of course, there are also plans for Zamboanga that is the 
western side of the E-A-G-A and there are already a lot of 
interaction taking place between the business groups as well as 
officials. And there are also plans for other key centers even 
if they are not regional centers. 
  [Ramos] So, I would hope that again, let us not let our 
envy overcome us because what is needed here is support, mutual 
support and synergy, what we are doing for Region X. 
  The power plants are there. On the part of the private 
sector, the (Tomin) series in Iligan, that's about 100 megawatts 
with an investment of $100 million. And on the part of the 
government, Napocor [National Power Corporation], the 
100-megawatt power barge in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, Region X, 
but that serves all of Mindanao. 
  So, don't worry, it's coming. But it will come to you if you 
go for it. Instead of waiting for the ripe guavas to fall on top 
of our head, we have to go and grab the opportunities. 
  Now, one reason why I am going to Davao on three successive 
weekends is, first, I have not visited Davao Oriental. I have 
visited Cagayan de Oro and Misamis Oriental maybe four times 
since I became president, as well as other parts of Region X. I 
have not visited Davao del Sur, and I have not visited Davao del 
Norte, because there is one for the three separate regions that 
I am going there. So, please don't be envious of that because I 
visit these places on a need basis.

  [Text] President Ramos yesterday approved in principle the 
adoption of new policies in the 1994 Investment Priorities Plan 
(IPP), among them the withdrawal of the income tax holiday for 
garment exports to quota countries and all expansion projects of 
domestic-oriented industries. 
  The IPP which lists the preferred areas of economic activity 
that will be promoted by the government this year, also adopted 
the following policies: 

  -  Incentives shall be given only to importation of brand-new 
and unused equipment and spare parts. 
  -  Capital equipment incentives shall be available for three 
years 
only from the date of project registration, but a six-year 
availment period shall be given for projects which take long to 
bear results. 
  -  Projects of a firm producing the same products and locating 
outside the 50 kilometer radius of the firm's site may be 
registered as new. 
  -  Expansion projects by firms which applied for registration as 
new export producers prior to 1 January 1989 and consequently 
registered will be exempted from the industrial location policy. 
  -  New enterprises registered under the 1994 IPP shall be given 
five years to avail themselves of the exemption from wharfage 
dues and any export tax, duty impost and fees. Expansion 
projects, however, shall no longer be entitled to this incentive. 

    The 1994 IPP contains 59 preferred areas of activities, 
majority of which are carry overs from the 1993 IPP. Of these, 
12 are new inclusions. 
  President Ramos also stressed the need to speed up passage 
of 
pending economic measures in Congress. 
  The president made the statement after Finance Secretary 
Roberto de Ocampo informed him International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
is expected to approve the government's Letter of Intent and the 
Memorandum of Economic Policy by end of June. Aside from the 
$650 million in Extended Fund Facility to be released by the IMF 
to the Philippines in three tranches over three years, the 
program will also serve as the country's exit plan with the IMF. 
  The other vital economic measures still pending in Congress, 
the president said, include the bill liberalizing the entry of 
foreign banks, the investment incentives bill for the mining 
industry, the Magna Carta for Exporters, Education bill, Armed 
Forces modernization bill, Public Works Act, and other bills 
contained in the Social Pact for Empowered Development (SPEED).

  [Text] A delegation of U.S.-Vietnam war veterans leaves for 
Hanoi this weekend on a trip designed to help account for 
missing servicemen from both sides of the war. The Americans 
will hand over maps, snapshots, identity cards, and other 
battlefield souvenirs that they hope will help to trace some of 
more than 300,000 Vietnamese who went missing in action. 
  The items were collected from U.S. veterans and are to be 
presented by a 16-member delegation. The Vietnamese veterans of 
America believe that if initiative can make a significant 
contribution to the 20-year effort, they make accounting for 
2,234 American POW-MIA [Prisoners of War-Missing in Action] and 
Vietnam's 300,000 missing.

<F P=106> [Article by U Chong-chang: "Making a Living Is More </F>
Important Than Ideology -- Members of General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan, Chongnyon, Are Wavering"] 
  [Text] Chongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan], a source of money for North Korea and its overseas 
subordinate organization, is wavering. The organization itself 
is still following the North Korean line, but its constituents 
are wavering. The possibility of their collective secession from 
Chongnyon is still slim because their families are held in North 
Korea as hostages, because they would have no means of 
livelihood if they leave Chongnyon, and because of the sense of 
loyalty that they should not betray the organization that gave 
them help. Although they are physically involved in Chongnyon, 
their sense of disappointment with North Korea, which they 
believed to be a paradise on earth, has increased over the years 
and their expectations for reunification are growing distant. 
As a result, an attitude of attaching more importance to 
"oneself" than the "organization" is being created. 
  The nationality of pro-Chongnyon people is simply "Korean" 
[Choson], neither North nor South Korean. On the other hand, 
members of the Federation of Korean Residents in Japan [Mindan-- 
pro-ROK organization] clearly have the nationality of the ROK. 
Because there are no diplomatic relations established with North 
Korea, the Japanese Government does not recognize the 
nationality of "Korean" as the title of the nation. The Japanese 
Government regards it merely as an "emblem." If pro-Chongnyon 
people want to visit North Korea, they have to obtain a "voyage 
certificate" from the Japanese Government without fail. If they 
do not obtain this certificate, they will not be allowed to 
return to Japan. 
  This is not all the inconveniences that affect their daily 
life. With its past record of "destructive and violent acts" 
committed in the course of its formation, Chongnyon is an 
organization subject to application of the Japanese "destruction 
prevention law." If Chongnyon commits acts destroying Japanese 
order, the Japanese Government may issue an order for forcible 
dissolution of Chongnyon at any time according to the law. This 
is why Chongnyon headquarters frequently hand out an order to 
its subordinate organizations to abide by the law. On the 
contrary, Mindan is not subject to application of this law. 
  There are many factors threatening Chongnyon organizations, 
including various restrictions, a sense of upcoming economic 
unrest if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea, and 
human rights issues for Japanese living in North Korea that have 
been raised among the people in Japan. Moreover, even its 
constituents tend to show a move to seek "oneself" instead of 
"organization" and "welfare" instead of "ideology." As a 
result, Chongnyon's Central Standing Committee is in a difficult 
position of having to simultaneously deal with outside threats 
and internal discontent. 
  In testimony at the Japanese Diet on 30 March, Ogata 
Shigetake, director-general of the Japanese Agency for Public 
Security and Investigation, said that there are about 680,000 
South and North Korean people residing in Japan. Of them, 
369,000 are pro-Mindan and 247,000 are pro-Chongnyon. He also 
revealed that among pro-Chongnyon people 56,000 are actively 
involved in Chongnyon. These 56,000 people are "main force" 
[Chonjong yowon] who sustain Chongnyon organizations. They are 
only one-fourth of all Chongnyon constituents. 
  This "main force" is further classified into "organizational 
staff," "full-time workers" and "activists." The organizational 
staff and full-time workers are paid every month by the 
Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and activists are those who 
positively participate in Chongnyon activities. They play the 
role of shock brigades by actively opposing anti-Chongnyon 
forces within Japan by violent means in disguise of lawfulness. 
Organizational staff and full-time workers are afraid that 
diplomatic relations will be established between Japan and North 
Korea. They fear that if Japanese-North Korean diplomatic 
relations are established, Chongnyon's properties and 
organizations will be absorbed and they will lose their jobs to 
those who North Korea assigns to Japan. 
<H5>  500,000 Yen Per Person for a Meeting With Kim Il-song </H5>
  North Korea's Kim Il-song sent a congratulatory message to 
Han Tok-su, chairman of Chongnyon, on 1 January 1993, and 
emphasized the strengthening of Chongnyon organizations and the 
establishment of an ideological guidance system. In this 
message, Kim Il-song urged Chongnyon to promote its patriotic 
work--the work of supporting North Korea--to a higher stage and 
to prepare Chongnyon to be a "reliable defender of the socialist 
fatherland." 
  Experts in issues concerning Chongnyon unanimously noted 
that 
the popularity of North Korea within Chongnyon began to 
gradually decrease starting in the early 1980's and began to 
fall rapidly in the late eighties. The amount of money remitted 
to North Korea by individuals fell to 10 million yen from 100 
million yen, and has even fallen to 1 million yen subsequently. 
  Since the amount of money remitted to North Korea has 
decreased, North Korea resorted to various means to deprive 
Chongnyon of money. Mr. Chang Myong-su (60), senior secretary of 
the "Council for Measures for Compatriots Repatriated to North 
Korea," who is waging a movement for human rights of the 
compatriots repatriated to North Korea, said: 
  Two hundred students of Chongnyon-affiliated Choson 
University were collectively repatriated to North Korea in 1972. 
North Korea tried to send 50 students of the 200 to Japan in 
1991 for the purpose of begging money from their former 
classmates who inherited wealth from their parents and who were 
now engaged in large business by pleading their difficult life 
in North Korea. North Korea gave up this plan because of a 
possibility of diplomatic friction and fear that the students 
would escape and not return to North Korea. 
  North Korea also attempted to sell grave sites to Chongnyon 
in 1984. A Chongnyon-affiliated leading businessman said: Any 
man, after getting old, thinks of his native home. This is more 
true for Chongnyon's first generation, which is older than 60. 
North Korea, keenly sensing such feelings by Chongnyon's first 
generation, proposed the sale of grave sites in an attempt to 
earn foreign currency. In other words, North Korea wanted to 
sell excellent sites in native towns for grave sites for the 
sake of money. This work was urged under Kim Chong-il's 
leadership. The concrete amount of payment for each pyong [land 
measurement] of land was bargained for. Kim Il-song, learning 
of this, opposed the sale, and stated that "although earning 
foreign currency is important, the act of selling land in a 
socialist country cannot be tolerated." 
  An even more serious incident occurred during the Pyongyang 
youth festival in 1989. The Pyongyang festival was an 
international event arranged by North Korea in an attempt to 
cope with the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yim Su-kyong, a student of 
Korea University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, voluntarily went 
to the North in order to attend this event. In the wake of this 
youth festival, North Korea advanced the following propaganda in 
an effort to induce donations to Chongnyon: "If you pay 5 
million yen [$49,000] per person, you will be allowed to meet 
the great leader by visiting Pyongyang by a special plane." 
  Nevertheless, the response to this propaganda was 
negligible. 
Therefore, North Korea lowered the amount of payment, and in the 
final stage, the amount was decreased to 500,000 yen per person. 
The condition of meeting Kim Il-song by visiting Pyongyang in a 
special plane remained unchanged. As this was revealed, 
Chongnyon's main force publicly complained, stating that they 
devotedly worked for the socialist fatherland throughout their 
life but they were unable to meet the great leader. Now, 
however, if one pays money, a meeting with the great leader will 
be granted. How on earth can this happen? 
  One of the impending difficult problems to which Chongnyon 
shows a most sensitive reaction is the anti-Chongnyon movement 
being waged in Japan. Anti-Chongnyon activities in Japan are 
categorized by two movements: One movement is pushed for and 
led by Ogawa, a professor of Tokyo University, and is waged by 
Japanese human rights organizations calling for the promotion of 
human rights in North Korea. The other movement is led by Chang 
Myong-su and is waged by former Chongnyon's core members calling 
for human rights protection of Korean compatriots repatriated to 
North Korea.

  Professor Ogawa is a person well-known to us who revealed 
and made an issue of human rights in our country during the 
fifth and sixth Republics. However, he has now changed his 
attitude and presented human rights violations in North Korea to 
the Japanese Government. 
  An anti-Chongnyon rally was held last April in Osaka and 
Tokyo. The rallies were disturbed by an organized opposition of 
the main forces [chonjong yowon] of Chongnyon. The Chongnyon 
main forces checked and frustrated the Osaka rally by force of 
arms. 
  As this became a controversial issue in Japanese society, 
the 
Japanese police searched 13 Chongnyon offices in Osaka. Such a 
hard-line attitude of the Japanese police was said to be 
unprecedented. The Chongnyon could not counter the Japanese 
police's hard-line measures. Herein lies Chongnyon's dilemma. 
The dilemma is that if Chongnyon ignores anti-Chongnyon 
activities, a situation endangering its organizations will 
result and if it uses force against anti-Chongnyon activities it 
will result in the Japanese police further cracking down on 
Chongnyon organizations and may lead them to eventually apply 
the "destruction prevention law." It is known that Chongnyon 
has enough strength to the extent that it can buy off leading 
figures in Japanese political circles. However, it seems to be 
difficult for Chongnyon to check and frustrate human rights 
groups' activities. 
  Under such a crisis, there have been signs that the unity of 
the organization is shaky. A typical example is its members' 
complaints against Ho Chong-man, its responsible vice chairman. 
Ho assumed the post last July. He is virtually the No. 2 man 
of Chongnyon and is regarded to succeed Chairman Han Tok-su. 
  There still is controversy inside Chongnyon over the 
appointment of Ho to that post. Chongnyon was originally 
supposed to be made up of one first vice chairman and nine vice 
chairmen under the chairman. If the chairman is in an accident, 
the first vice chairman is supposed to be the acting chairman. 
Disregarding this stipulation, the Central Standing Committee 
of Chongnyon appointed Ho to that post on the grounds it was 
ordered by Kim Chong-il. At that time, Yi Chin-kyu was the 
first vice chairman. 
  On the grounds that it is wrong to appoint a formerly 
expelled person to the post of vice chairman, there was 
prevalent criticism against the appointment of Ho--who had been 
expelled in 1968 after being branded a factionalist in an 
internal feud involving Chongnyon's command system--to the post 
of responsible vice chairman. Any decision of the Central 
Standing Committee should be referred to an enlarged central 
committee for deliberation and then to a plenary meeting for 
approval. This appointment, however, did not follow such a 
procedure. This move has been criticized as being an expedient. 
Since the appointment of Ho, the Chongnyon Central Committee 
has held a succession of support rallies or study meetings for 
bureau chief-level and above officials, thus preventing this 
from becoming an issue. 
  Despite this, Chongnyon members have been keeping a keen eye 
on the activities of Ho as he is smart in `money.' Ho had been 
trained in the International Affairs Department and the 
Financial Affairs Department of Chongnyon. He has never worked 
in the Organization Bureau or Social and Cultural Bureau. Those 
inside and outside Chongnyon say that he is a careerist who has 
handled only money. Therefore, it is believed he will forcibly 
sell Chongnyon's property in Japan and send it to North Korea if 
it is necessary to advance his career. The issue of disposing 
of Chongnyon property is a sensitive one between North Korea and 
Chongnyon. 
<H5>  Fight Over Property Between North Korea and Chongyon </H5>
  Chongnyon members have shown responses of "it is unexpected" 
or "it is a mystery" regarding Kim Il-song's appointment of Ho 
Chong-man. They suspect it is a calculated step to divert 
Chongnyon property to North Korea as Ho is a colleague of former 
Chongnyon Vice Chairman Kim Pyong-sik, who was appointed vice 
president of North Korea in an abrupt manner. 
  Chongnyon property is estimated to amount to as much as 
between 20 trillion yen (about 200 billion dollars) and 30 
trillion yen from a combination of bank deposits of Chongnyon 
people and stationary assets, such as buildings affiliated with 
Chongnyon. This is several tens of times as much as North 
Korea's GNP of $21.7 billion as of the end of 1992. As of the 
end of July 1993, deposits at finance institutions, such as the 
Choson Bank, Credit Union, and Kumgang Insurance Company, 
amounted to 2,390 billion yen (about 25 billion dollars). 
Buildings such as Chongnyon Central Hall, Choson Publishing 
Hall, and CHOSON SINBO are located in the center of downtown 
Tokyo, where land prices are the highest in the world. A total 
of 148 schools affiliated with Chongnyon are also stationary 
assets with immense value. 
  Originally such stationary assets belonged to each 
individual. As their owners die, ownership has experienced a 
change in type. The type differs by regions. In the case of 
Osaka, there are four Chongnyon headquarters in the eastern, 
western, southern, and central regions. The land and buildings 
in the eastern, southern, and central regions are all under 
individuals' names. The land in the western region is under an 
individual's name, but the building is under the name of 
Kongyong Corporation. The corporation is known to be affiliated 
with Chongnyon. Property in some regions are under the names of 
a responsible person of a Chongnyon chapter, a responsible 
person in the commercial and industrial sector, or a third 
person. 
  North Korea claims they own this property. Some people in 
Chongnyon, including responsible vice chairman Ho Chong-man, 
sympathize with this claim. The majority assert, however, that 
the property should be used for the welfare of all of Chongnyon. 
Their logic is that it should be used for such welfare because 
individuals have donated the central headquarters, the 
publishing hall, and schools to the Chongnyon organization. 
Cadres of North Korea and Chongnyon have had frequent contacts 
to discuss this issue since the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but it is 
reported they have failed to reach a conclusion. 
  Those inside Chongnyon were greatly shocked in September 
1990 
when Kanemaru, vice president of Japan's Liberal Democratic 
Party; and a vice chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, 
issued--when they visited North Korea--with North Korea's 
Workers Party a "Three Parties' Joint Declaration" related to 
establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea. 
They were shocked because they felt uneasy that if North Korea 
and Japan should establish relations, the nationality of those 
affiliated with Chongnyon would be changed to North Korean and 
they would have to abide by North Korea's Constitution. Thus, 
they had misgivings that their rights to their property in Japan 
might not be recognized. 
  With Kanemaru's visit to North Korea as momentum, Chongyon 
organized a project team to make a detailed examination of such 
an issue. Such a move was discovered by the ROK Embassy in 
Japan. Around that time, our government supported Chongnyon from 
the standpoint of compatriots by publishing a booklet entitled 
"An effect of the normalization of relations between North Korea 
and Japan on the compatriots affiliated with Chongnyon" in 
cooperation with Mindan. It is reported that the Chongnyon's 
own project team has failed to do anything due to obstruction 
from North Korea. It is said that the movement to protect 
Chongnyon property is still under way. 
  Under such complicated circumstances, the assumption of the 
post of responsible vice chairmanship of Ho Chong-man, a finance 
expert and a colleague of Kim Chong-il, has further agitated 
Chongnyon members. It is said that some Chongnyon cadres are 
secretly hiding their property to avoid it being confiscated by 
North Korea and that some are demanding the return of donated 
land through law suits. It is said that a perception 
"Chongnyon's property is of the nation" is widely spreading in 
Osaka where many Chongnyon-affiliated people are living. 
  In fact, people affiliated with Chongnyon are said to have 
almost neglected preparing for their old age. They have been 
inculcated by Chongnyon that "if reunification should 
materialize, you could return home." Thus, they have eagerly 
waited only for the day of reunification. With the dream of 
returning home some day, they are said to pin almost all of 
their hopes on that organization, which would make such a dream 
come true at an early date. So, they donated their own money to 
build schools and spared no money to be sent to North Korea with 
a view to contributing to the development of their fatherland. 
This notwithstanding, as they are aging and their children are 
growing up, their expectations for reunification are becoming a 
more and more remote dream. 
  In November 1993, the Chongnyon Central Committee discussed 
the issue of "protection of compatriots' rights" as an important 
agenda item. It was the only agenda discussed. According to 
the ROK Embassy in Japan, it was the first time the Chongnyon 
Central Committee ever convened with the single agenda item of 
"protection of rights." The ROK Embassy understood that this 
was a sign of change on the part of Chongnyon, which has thus 
far shouted political slogans, but is now paying attention to 
its members' welfare. 
  Many Chongnyon-affiliated schools are now faced with the 
crisis of closure due to the drastic reduction of the number of 
students. This is because parents are reluctant to send their 
children to such schools on grounds that "it is difficult to 
adapt to Japanese society, where competition is fierce, if you 
graduate from Chongnyon-affiliated schools where ideological 
education is emphasized." All the Chongnyon-affiliated schools 
in the Osaka area took down placards of Kim Il-song hung in 
school buildings last year. This is a sign showing that a wind 
of change--today's life is more important than ideology--is 
blowing within Chongnyon.

  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government has concluded that it is premature to consider 
joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since 
membership would likely bring more harm than good to the country. 
  The Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry said Friday it will 
state that now is not the right time to discuss joining the 
regional free trade accord, which took effect early this year, 
if Mexico brings up the matter during bilateral trade 
ministerial talks on May 16-17. 
  Korea has not yet been approached by NAFTA member countries 
-- the United States, Canada and Mexico -- to join them in the 
free trade agreement through either official or unofficial 
channels, a ministry official said. 
  "But we want to clearly state our position now because Korea 
has been under suspicion of intentionally spreading rumors of 
its becoming a NAFTA member," he said. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor also brushed aside 
the possibility of including Korea in the regional trade 
arrangement at a Senate committee hearing last February. 
  He said Chile and other Latin American countries would be 
the 
first candidates to jump aboard and distant nations like 
Singapore and Korea were not under consideration at present. 
  The initial idea behind NAFTA reportedly involves turning it 
into "AFTA" -- an American free trade agreement -- that could 
flex its muscles against rival alliances across the Atlantic and 
the Pacific. 
  The ministry coordinated the views of economy-related 
agencies and organizations and concluded that it is too early to 
consider NAFTA membership. 
  Supporting this conclusion, traders' bodies like the Korea 
Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) and the Federation of Korean 
Industries (FKI) have said that joining NAFTA would cause more 
harm than good. 
  Some foreign media have reported that Seoul and Washington 
secretly agreed to link Korea to NAFTA, but these reports proved 
groundless, a KFTA official said. 
  The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) also pointed out 
that 
tariff benefits from joining NAFTA were limited and the 
disadvantages great due to complete agricultural and services 
market opening. 
  It recommended that NAFTA membership be considered long 
after 
the country adjusts to the impact of the Uruguay Round accord.

  [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- As part of its efforts to 
cope with diplomatic and trade challenges in the post-Uruguay 
Round era, the government will recruit more negotiating experts 
-- perhaps as many as 15 percent of the successful examinees 
taking the yearly state diplomatic service test. 
  Reporting to the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) 
Thursday, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said the Ministry 
will expand its special recruitment program to strengthen its 
language ability and international economic and trade expertise. 
  Revising the current inefficient qualification procedures of 
the supernumerary appointment system, Hong said the written test 
for English and law will be replaced by curriculum vitae 
screening and interviews. 
  The Ministry may also introduce thesis testing in English 
and 
economics for the exam's second round, requiring that the 
economics questions be answered in English as well. 
  In order to make the most of Korea's overseas missions, the 
Ministry is to set up computer linkages with the Korea Trade 
Promotion Corp. (KOTRA), the Korea Foreign Trade Association 
(KFTA), the Bank of Korea and other organizations with offices 
abroad. 
  Noting the government's trade channels are scattered among 
60 
divisions in 20 agencies, the Ministry will seek to absorb all 
trade negotiating power to provide for consistent and effective 
decision- making and implementation. 
  To raise the diplomatic force's efficiency, the government 
will reduce overseas missions to 130 or 135 from the current 
141. It will also refrain from posting grade-three or higher 
officials from other government agencies than the Foreign 
Ministry in overseas missions to prevent abuse of manpower and 
budget.

  [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], appears to be walking 
on thorns these days as rumors continue to spread of a possible 
political comeback by his predecessor, Kim Tae-chung. 
  Despite adamant denials by his aides and the retired 
politician himself, persistent speculation on a Kim comeback is 
having repercussions throughout the country, with some political 
pundits already predicting the dawning of "a new era of two 
Kims." 
  These observers believe there may be a new round of politics 
pitting DJ, as Kim Tae-chung is popularly called, against 
President Kim Yong-sam just like in the old days. 
  Meanwhile, talk like "crippled" and "DJ rules from behind 
the 
veil" is used to describe Yi Ki-taek's questionable leadership 
of the Democratic Party. 
  Outwardly Yi Ki-taek is maintaining a stony silence about 
such speculation. This is quite a change from the recent past 
when he observed that Kim Tae-chung could comment on any 
political issue, if he so desired, as a member of the party. 
  In an emotional farewell shortly after his defeat in the 
1992 
presidential election, Kim Tae-chung declared that he was 
retiring from politics for good. Nevertheless, he said he would 
like to retain his membership in the party for the time being. 
  In a recent interview with a provincial newspaper, Kim said 
that even if he wanted to make a comeback, he would not ride on 
the back of the Democratic Party or any faction. Hounded by 
reporters to clarify the remark, Yi lost his temper and 
retorted: "What do you want me to say?" 
  Yi was said to have ordered his aides not to comment on this 
question, either. 
  Yi's silence is probably due to his precarious position: He 
can neither deny nor confirm the speculation that Kim, despite 
his own denials, used the newspaper interview to extend a feeler 
on his comeback, placed ever so gently and ambiguously in the 
political arena as well as in the minds of the general public. 
  Yi has already declared his intention to run for president 
in 
1997, and it is common knowledge that he was counting on Kim 
Tae- chung to muster powerful support for him when the time 
comes. 
  Hence his silence, as he would be most affected if the 
69-year- old former DP chairman attempted a comeback. 
  Many political observers are looking no further ahead than 
the next presidential election. Yi Ki-taek's status as the 
leader of the No. 1 opposition party is already being eroded by 
the rumors of a DJ comeback. 
  In fact, Yi's chairmanship of the Democratic Party has 
always 
been shaky at best. He has been able to manage the party, some 
claim, only by riding piggyback on the DJ followers' faction. 
  By coincidence or design, however, DJ's followers -- or the 
Tongyo-tong faction as they are called -- are increasingly 
asserting themselves, expressing "displeasure" whenever Yi 
Ki-taek states his intention to run for president in 1997. 
  But rumors of a DJ comeback are not working entirely against 
Yi Ki-taek. 
  The Yi camp believes that the more people talk about DJ's 
return, the more difficult it would become for Kim to make an 
actual comeback. Kim's and his aides' denials of the rumours 
are apparently being made out of a similar belief. 
  And if DJ's comeback proved difficult under the present 
circumstances, the partnership between Yi and Kim -- however 
awkward it may be -- would be maintained for some time.

  [Text] It has been learned that China recently sent an 
official warning message to North Korea urging it not to change 
nuclear fuel rods by itself without the presence of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and to allow 
additional inspections by the IAEA at the earliest possible date. 
  In particular, China sternly warned that changing nuclear 
fuel rods on North Korea's own would be a definite violation of 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and would result not only in 
terrifying denunciation from the international community, but 
also in making sanctions against North Korea inevitable. 
  The above was revealed by a high-level diplomatic source in 
Beijing on 12 May who added: "The strong warning from China was 
an important motive behind North Korea's recent announcement to 
allow the additional inspections by the IAEA and to postpone the 
changing of nuclear fuel rods.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Pak Chong-mun: "Government's Belated </F>
Attention to Japan's Moves for Nuclear Armament"] 
  [Text] With the operation of fast-breeder reactors, 
completion of the largest nuclear reprocessing plant in the 
world, and introduction of plutonium from overseas, Japan, our 
neighbor, has aroused heated public debate in the West. Our 
government, which kept silent despite such heated public debate, 
has begun to direct its attention to Japan's nuclear policy. 
  What touched off our government's interest was the 
unexpected 
discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium in the nuclear 
reprocessing plant operated by Japan Energy and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation. The entire world has suspected North 
Korea of having extracted and concealed kilogram-levels of 
plutonium prior to inspection by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] in May 1992. We may point out that contrary to 
such global suspicion on North Korea, the recent incident in 
Japan has been treated in an exceedingly light manner. In fact, 
nine nuclear bombs the size of the bomb (12.5 kiloton) dropped 
in Hiroshima in 1945 can be manufactured with this amount of 
plutonium. This should not be overlooked. 
  Needless to say, direct comparison of plutonium possessed by 
Japan with that of North Korea is unreasonable. While pushing 
ahead with nuclear energy development by putting forward the 
slogan, "democracy, openness, and independence," Japan has 
allowed the highest-degree of inspections by IAEA. Contrary to 
this, North Korea has been trying its utmost to evade IAEA 
inspections as much as possible. 
  The IAEA is using most of its budget to watch Japanese and 
German nuclear facilities, by permanently posting seven 
inspectors in Japan's nuclear reprocessing facilities. Thus, 
the discovery of such a large amount of plutonium which the IAEA 
failed to uncover is certainly an issue. 
  We may point out, first of all, that there are many 
unforeseen blind spots [sagak chidae] in the IAEA's inspection 
system. An even more serious problem is that even if Japan, 
which is classified as a "semi-nuclear state," were to convert 
nuclear material on its own after getting rid of IAEA 
surveillance, no other nation would be able to take steps until 
its conversion was exposed to the public. 
  It is not easy for one to use nuclear material for purposes 
other than the generation of atomic energy, even if this 
material is produced outside surveillance network, because 
thorough surveys are conducted at each important step in the 
enrichment, reprocessing, and stockpiling of nuclear fuel. 
Nonetheless, Japanese nuclear technology, has reached a top 
level in the world, and includes laser enrichment technology 
that can be put into operation secretly. This being the case, 
experts point out that Japan can convert nuclear material 
whenever it should so desire. 
  At the same time, the Japanese openly declared plan to 
stockpile plutonium in order to operate high-breeder reactors 
and converters, has even more serious implications. Experts in 
the West believe that Japan will stockpile 71.6 tons of 
plutonium by 2004, and will be able to store 14.9 tons of 
plutonium from 1993 to 2004 in an unused state after using the 
amount necessary for use in atomic energy power stations. One 
can produces 1,500 to 2,000 small-size nuclear bombs with this 
amount of plutonium. Thus, the world is directing attention to 
the issue of Japanese plutonium. 
  Our government showed no objection to the Japanese 
denuclearization policy until last year, because it believed 
that the Japanese nuclear facilities were under strict 
international surveillance and that the United States would not 
remain indifferent to the Japanese moves for nuclear armament. 
Our government also put into consideration the fact that 
hurting the Japanese people's feelings would not help resolve 
either the North Korean nuclear problem or problems pertaining 
to past relations between the ROK and Japan in a satisfactory 
manner. However, the government has now changed its attitude 
with the discovery of plutonium as an occasion, to cautiously 
raise a voice toward the Japanese nuclear issue. It appears 
that the government's decision is based on its judgment that 
this issue should no longer be overlooked. Meanwhile, by taking 
issue with the possibility of Japanese nuclear armament, North 
Korea is continually attempting to deflect away attention from 
the declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, 
and our government has also had to consider this. Moreover, 
recent trends indicate that a possibile slackening in the 
U.S.-Japan security alliance relations, which has been key to 
blocking Japan's nuclear armament. This being the case, we 
should make appropriate preparations for such a situation.

  [Text] Washington, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The United States and 
North Korea held working-level talks in New York Thursday but a 
few issues were left dangling that make future prospects 
uncertain, sources here said after the contact. 
  Gary Samore, director of nonproliferation at the State 
Department, and Kenneth Quinones, from the North Korea section 
at the Department, attended the one-hour mid-level contact with 
Han Song-yol, counselor for political affairs at the North 
Korean Mission to the United Nations, officials said. 
  North Korea refused to say whether it has started changing 
the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt reactor or whether it will 
postpone the process, according to the officials. 
  It instead urged the Americans to open the next round of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue so that this issue can be 
negotiated, they said. 
  Postponement of the refueling is a condition for 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection of North 
Korean nuclear facilities. The agency told Pyongyang earlier 
this week it would send an inspection team "on the assumption" 
that North Korea was deferring the changing of the rods. 
  Officials here said the uncertainty over the nuclear reactor 
and the rods is making the IAEA uneasy about sending the 
inspection team. 
  They said it remains unclear whether the agency will go 
ahead 
and send the team to Pyongyang this weekend or wait for an 
official reply from North Korea before deciding on the dispatch. 
  "It's more correct to say that the situation right now has a 
lot of unclear issues than to say that it is uncertain," said

  Although speculation has it that the North Korea-U.S. 
high-level dialogue will take place late this month, there is a 
chance the meeting may be put off until June.

  [Text] Another working-level contact between North Korea 
and the United States for the settlement of the North Korean 
nuclear issue was held in New York early this morning, three 
days after the previous contact. 
  The contact was held after North Korea had announced it 
would 
allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. 
The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from 
New York: 
  [Begin Nam recording] The United States and North Korea had 
a chief and counselor-level working contact for over an hour 
early this morning to discuss allowing additional inspections 
[chuga sachal] and the third round of high-level talks. 
  As the contact was held only a few days after the previous 
contact on Tuesday and right after the IAEA's announcement of 
its decision to send an inspection team, a well-informed source 
said that this implies that a breakthrough will be provided soon 
through U.S.-North Korea negotiations. 
  The source said that there had been very positive contents 
in 
today's working-level contact noting that the United States 
reiterated its position on the inspection of fuel rods, which 
was also mentioned in the previous contact, and that North Korea 
responded to this. 
  During today's working-level contact, the United States 
urged 
that additional inspections should be properly conducted and 
stressed that the schedule of the third-round high-level talks 
should be discussed in the course of observing the development 
of inspections. North Korea reportedly demanded to hold the 
third- round talks as soon as possible since additional 
inspections and regular inspections [chonggi sachal] will be 
conducted. 
  The two sides reportedly decided to let the problem 
concerning inspections of fuel rods be technically solved 
between the IAEA and North Korea, and to hold another full-scale 
working-level contact on the third-round talks next week when 
inspections will be under way. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean tugboat 
anchored in Vladivostok harbor Thursday to tow an obsolete 
Russian submarine back to North Korea, the TOKYO SHIMBUN 
reported from the Russian Far East naval port Friday. 
  The North Korean boat is scheduled to pull up anchor and 
start towing the submarine Friday, the report said. 
  In November last year, Russia concluded a deal to sell 12 
obsolete diesel-engine submarines to North Korea, and has 
already delivered one to the North Korean port of Najin in 
December. 
  But delivery has been suspended since January when the 
Western press first reported on the contract. 
  Although Russian officials in Vladivostok say the obsolete 
submarines are being sold to North Korea as scrap iron, 
Pyongyang reportedly plans to use them for military purposes, 
the Japanese- language newspaper said. 
  The paper quoted a Russian official as saying Moscow would 
deliver the remaining 10 submarines in the near future under the 
terms of the contract. 
  The official added the contract provides for the presence of 
Russian officials at North Korea's dismantling of the submarines 
for scrap iron, but Pyongyang has yet to issue entry visas to 
Russians to monitor the work, raising suspicions that the 
submarines will be used for military purposes, the newspaper 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Sok-hwan] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam said he will not rush the 
issue of bringing North Korean loggers who escaped from logging 
camps in Siberia into the ROK. Moscow is welcoming such a 
remark by stating that the ROK Government has now started to 
have a correct understanding of the situation. 
  It was pointed out that various reports in Seoul on the 
North 
Korean loggers were quite different from the actual situation in 
Siberia. 
  Seoul's reports quoting ROK policy-makers that 'there are 
signs of collapse in North Korea,' and that hundreds of North 
Korean loggers earnestly desire to defect to the ROK, have left 
ROK diplomats in Moscow and correspondents, who have examined 
the loggers' issue for over three years, very bewildered. 
  These reports were formulated as if all of the escapees 
wanted to defect to the ROK and that the motive for their 
defection was due to the desire for freedom and disillusion of 
the Kim Il-song regime. This is greatly different from the 
actual situation. 
  Without considering the other side's situation, the ROK 
Government dealt with this complicated diplomatic issue as if it 
was a domestic issue, and gave the impression that the ROK 
Government had decided to accept the North Korean loggers. This 
was brought about due to the misunderstanding of the actual 
situation. 
  Three years ago ROK media reported on the human rights issue 
regarding the North Korean loggers. In 1993 this issue was 
presented to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva. This 
resulted in Russia including an article on human rights in the 
agreement on North Korean loggers. 
  At that time the escapees appealed for help at the ROK 
Embassy in Moscow, various companies, and churches, and some of 
them married 'Koreans' living in Moscow or Russian women to 
obtain certificates of residence. Some other escapees were 
successful in escaping to the ROK. 
  A total of 170 North Korean loggers went to the ROK 
diplomatic missions in Moscow, Vladivostok, and Almaty to seek 
help. Officials of these diplomatic missions, however, estimate 
that many loggers made repeat visits. 
  It is also being argued that among the 170 loggers there are 
a considerable amount of people who are working as 'foreign 
currency money earners' roaming throughout the former Soviet 
Union after conspiring with the agents of the North Korean 
logging sites. The Russian daily (SIBODNYA) made an in-depth 
study of the North Korean loggers issue and supported such an 
argument. 
  (SIBODNYA) reports that the foreign currency money earners 
work and receive daily wages by working in plants and 
cooperative farms in the Khavarovsk region run by Russians 
because it is far easier to earn money than by working in the 
logging camps. They even ignore the date for their return to 
the logging camps and run away to the back country in Russia and 
marry Russian women to guarantee their status. 
  ROK Embassy officials analyze that except for a minimum 
number of escapees, most of them want to remain in Russia and 
work as businessmen if their status is guaranteed because they 
fear the fatal blow their families in North Korea may face. 
  Some of the escapees appeared in ROK media and appealed 
through tears for their situation. It is a fact, however, that 
some of them still exchange letters with their families in the 
North. This shows that there are loggers who are unclear about 
their status and purpose. 
  Therefore, officials in Russia point out that if the 
government truly has the intention of resolving this issue, they 
must not hold the view that "even just a few of the escapees 
must be taken to the ROK" before President Kim visits Russia. 
  Rather, voices are being raised that a measure must be 
established, after a more thorough investigation of the 
situation is carried out, so that it will not become a difficult 
issue which will make it hard to hold dialogue with North Korea.

  [Text] Moscow, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Moscow has protested to 
Seoul about the allegedly overheated media coverage in South 
Korea of the issue of North Korean escapees from Siberian 
logging camps, diplomatic sources here said Thursday. 
  The Russian Government has stated that it might reconsider 
the basic policy on the loggers previously agreed with Seoul, 
thereby putting bilateral relations in a high state of tension, 
according to the sources. 
  The two countries' foreign ministers met in Moscow last 
month 
to agree on a basic policy under which Russia would deal with 
the North Korean escapees according to its domestic law but from 
a humanitarian point of view. [sentence as received] 
  The agreement also calls on Moscow to give Seoul maximum 
cooperation if the North Koreans want to resettle in the South. 
  Seoul is devising concrete measures to help North Korean 
refugees resettle in South Korea -- providing opportunities for 
vocational education and social adaptation training, for example. 
  Russia, however, took a tougher line when the loggers 
started 
receiving heavy coverage in the South Korean media, some of 
which compared the issue to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall 
in 1990. 
  The Russians, hoping not to further dampen relations with 
North Korea, expressed their bewilderment and dissatisfaction 
with such reports through a diplomatic channel to the South 
Korean Government, sources said. 
  Some Russian public security officials even suggested that 
Moscow should forget the earlier agreement with Seoul and not 
cooperate in dealing with the loggers, sources said. 
  A Russian Foreign Ministry official said the issue of the 
loggers would have already become a serious diplomatic problem 
had it not been for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's 
scheduled visit to Moscow in June. 
  Working-level consultations among related ministries on 
resettlement of the North Korean loggers are under way in 
Moscow, but some ministry officials are apparently mindful of 
North Korea raising objections, sources said. 
  Some Russian Government officials said Moscow may allow some 
North Korean loggers go to the South on the occasion of 
President Kim Yong-sam's visit, but that it may stop if South 
Korean papers keep playing up the issue. 
  So despite President Kim's visit to Moscow, the logger 
problem may seriously damage bilateral relations, experts on 
Korean issues say. 
  Complicating matters, Russia is anxious to mend fences with 
North Korea. 
  The diplomatic experts said Russia is seeking good relations 
with North Korea in a bid to gain more influence in Korean 
affairs, including the nuclear dispute.

  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- No North Korean logger has 
applied yet to come to South Korea or to settle in Russia, 
Moscow's ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze said Friday [13 
May]. 
  If there are any such requests, Moscow will handle them on a 
case-by-case basis, reviewing them carefully while taking into 
consideration the applicants' wishes from a humanitarian point 
of view, the ambassador said in an interview with YONHAP News 
Agency. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam is scheduled to visit 
Russia in June. 
  On the timing of the first resettlement of North Korean 
loggers, Kunadze said that in addition to the screening process, 
a presidential decision is necessary on procedural matters and 
this always requires time. 
  Asked about North Korea's nuclear capability, the ambassador 
said that according to a recent special report by a Russian 
intelligence agency, there are no signs that Pyongyang has 
nuclear bombs or the ability to acquire them anytime soon. 
  But Moscow is concerned that the North Korean nuclear 
problem 
has been clouded by uncertainty for over a year. Kunadze 
expressed hope that the various channels of dialogue such as 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), North Korea and the United States, and South-North Korea 
will make progress and succeed. 
  On compensation for the victims of a downed Korean air 
plane, 
the envoy said his home government is preparing a reply which 
will come soon. 
  The ambassador then commented on the North Korea-Soviet 
Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty that stipulates Moscow 
will automatically intervene in case of a war involving 
Pyongyang, explaining that Moscow's position is that the treaty 
remains in effect. 
  But the automatic intervention clause applies only to 
unprovoked military incidents, he said, and it is up to Russia 
to decide whether an incident was provoked or not. 
  He predicted that the issue involving the return of the old 
Russian legation site in Chung-dong, Seoul, is unlikely to be 
solved by the time President Kim visits. 
  But he suggested that the two sides are near an agreement, 
saying the matter might be resolved in the near future. 
  The ambassador discussed South Korean-Russian technology 
cooperation in the defense industry, emphasizing that no 
obstacles exist and such links will be of mutual benefit. 
  But there should be no double standards and no political 
influence in trying to boost cooperation, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Chinese sources knowledgeable in North Korean 
affairs reported on 12 May that North Korea is faced with "the 
worst food crisis in history" because its supply of reserve food 
has been depleted due to the grain damage caused by the cold 
weather last year and because it no longer receives food support 
from China, its major food supplier. 
  To solve the serious food problems, North Korea has for the 
past month allocated such raw materials as iron stock, which is 
conserved by the central government, to each local government to 
be exchanged for emergency food with the border areas of China 
and Russia, according to the sources. 
  North Korea even tacitly permits the disposal of antiques 
designated as cultural property and rare animals and plants by 
individuals or groups that are able to contact foreign countries. 
  People's government officials of Saebyol County in North 
Hamgyong Province, North Korea, which is located across the 
Tuman River from Hunchun in China's Jilin Province, visited 
Hunchun people's government officials on 6 May to discuss 
exchanging 700 tonnes of iron stock for 1,700 tonnes of corn. 
The officials failed because China opposed the exchange. 
  The sources also reported that the number of undernourished 
and starving North Korean people and children suffering from 
body swelling caused by beriberi is increasing throughout the 
country because the reserve supply of barley has almost been 
depleted. 
  North Korea also allows people to dispose of anything to 
exchange for food and to travel in the country to contact 
Chinese and Russian people with the purpose of obtaining food.

  [Text] At a time when public interest is centered on North 
Korea's food shortages and the number of North Korean escapees 
is increasing, the Association Studying the North Korean 
Agriculture held a seminar marking its founding on 7 May and 
analyzed the current North Korean farming situation. This is the 
summary from the report made by Chungang University Professor 
Kim Song-hun at the seminar. (Editor's Note) 
  North Korea has statistics on its food situation to report 
to 
the outside world and the true statistics are kept under strict 
control. According to statistics compiled by the National 
Unification Board in August 1993, with the help of relevant 
agencies, North Korea's gross grain output was 4.81 million 
tonnes in 1990; 4.43 million tonnes in 1991; 4.27 million tonnes 
in 1992; and 3.88 million tonnes in 1993. This shows that its 
output is on a downward trend. However, it is estimated that 
North Koreans need to consume between 5.5 and 6.5 million tonnes 
of food. 
  With the increase of the number of people fleeing the 
country, North Korea could no longer put aside the food shortage 
problem. Furthermore, out of the necessity to stabilize its 
political system after Kim Chong-il inherits power, North Korea 
has begun to purchase food from abroad half-openly. What should 
be noted is that North Korea purchased 0.15 million tonnes of 
wheat from the United States in 1991 and during 1992-1993 it 
directly purchased 0.25 million tonnes of grain worth $0.2 
billion from the United States. 
  North Korea's food situation is getting worse due to its 
natural, physical, and technological restrictions. The range 
and variety of mechanization are not wide, and chemical 
fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, and herbicides are in short 
supply. Even the land reclamation program vigorously pushed 
ahead from the late seventies to the early eighties is inactive 
these days. 
  North Korea shows no sign of promoting its collective 
management system and the chuche-oriented farming in the near 
future. What is more, agricultural productivity is expected to 
drop much more. On the contrary, the rate of urbanization 
rapidly soared in recent days and 60 percent of its total 
population lives in urban areas. Due to this, the demand for 
agricultural products has increased. 
  Inefficiency in the agricultural sector has had far-reaching 
effects on other sectors, bringing about enormous restrictions 
to the smooth development of the overall economy. However, 
North Korea's standard of agricultural science and technology; 
improvement of plant breeding; farming techniques; and 
cultivation methods are considerably high. The problem is that 
it needs a mechanism that can link all these factors and needs 
to introduce market economy principles. 
  The foundation for the unification of the North and South 
cannot be solidified if North Korea does not overcome the 
backwardness of its grain production. Since the degree of South 
Korea's crops self- sufficiency only accounts for 30 percent and 
agriculture is the weakest sector in the South Korean economy, 
the two Koreas cannot but supplement their weakness in the 
agricultural sector through the exchange of and cooperation in 
agricultural techniques and capital.

<F P=106> [By reporter Song Ui-ho: "Manpower in North Korea's Nuclear </F>
Development Program: Its Personal Relationships, Training and 
Taboos"] 
  [Excerpts] 
  -- To Sang-nok, Han In-sok and other scientists who 
defected to the North against the "National University Plan" 
laid the foundations. -- Under General Manager 
Chong Kun, a "Moscow-trained group" including Choe Hak-kun and 
Yun Ho-chin played the key role. -- Theses 
written by 100-odd North Korean scientists in the 1970's are 
kept in the U.S. National Archives. 
-- Construction of the Yongbyon nuclear development 
complex began in 1962. -- Security is so tight 
that even Kim Il-song has to disembark from his car when 
entering the Yongbyon complex. 
  When did North Korea embark on its nuclear development 
program? Who have participated in it, and how has Pyongyang 
trained the required manpower? And what are the general software 
levels of the program? 
  These questions surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue 
have not been fully answered, although there has been a great 
deal of discussion dealing with hardware. There have been 
debates as to the type of atomic reactors in Yongbyon, the 
amount of plutonium they could produce, the kind of reprocessing 
facilities, and the number of weapons they have possibly 
developed by now, but almost nothing is known about the people 
who possibly have participated in those processes. 
  For this reporting, I interviewed nuclear scientists in the 
South, persons who had served in high positions in North Korea 
in the past, and correspondents who visited Pyongyang. I also 
received assistance from intelligence agencies at home and 
abroad. Among them were some who were deeply involved in the 
nuclear development effort in the Pak Chong-hui era. Also, I 
used channels with links to the Japanese Cabinet Information 
Research Office. 
  North Korea first began exploring nuclear development 
possibilities in the mid-1950's immediately after the end of the 
Korean War. Kim Il-song, who had been unnerved by MacArthur's 
atomic bomb threat, reorganized the Korean People's Army [KPA] 
in 1954 right after the end of the war, establishing a "Nuclear 
Weapons Defense Branch" for the first time as part of the 
reorganization. 
  The next year, in 1955, President Eisenhower went so far as 
to say that "new-type nuclear weapons" will be deployed to the 
U.S. Forces in Korea [USFK], stirring North Korea. Meanwhile, 
President Syngman Rhee, crying out for "March to the North for 
Reunification," declared that "if the North invades us, we will 
respond with a nuclear holocaust." North Korea, confronted with 
the crisis, held a mammoth Pyongyang City Mass Rally on 5 August 
1955 to condemn the United States. According to Mr "A," a former 
North Korean official who participated in that rally, "the 
uneasy feelings the nuclear threat caused among the North Korean 
authorities and population then were almost a panic." 
  About that time, the former Soviet Union, then the leading 
power of the communist world, launched an all-out effort to 
develop a new-type, nuclear weapon that can match what the 
United States had. 
  Thus came the "Agreement on the Organization of a Joint 
Nuclear Research Center" signed in 1956 as part of Soviet 
nuclear strategy. The agreement stated that 11 socialist 
countries (the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, 
Mongolia, Poland, East Germany, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and 
Albania) will pool manpower and material resources for joint 
nuclear research and utilization to strengthen the nuclear 
capabilities of the socialist camp. 
  The joint research thus started was conducted at the 
renowned 
Dubna Nuclear Research Center in Moscow. It was an old institute 
reorganized and rechristened "Dubna Joint Nuclear Research 
Center," they say. "It was then that North Korea, in accordance 
with the agreement, began sending 20 to 30 nuclear physicists to 
Dubna every year," said Mr "A." 
  Subsequently, the "Korea-USSR Agreement on the Peaceful Use 
of Atomic Energy" was signed in 1959, and North Korea began 
creating a nuclear development complex in Yongbyon in 1962. 
Through all this, Pyongyang took interest in a nuclear 
development program early on. 
  Then came the 1962 "Cuban crisis" which led North Korea to 
distrust the Soviet nuclear umbrella. The Soviet fleet steaming 
through the Caribbean Sea carrying missiles to Cuba was 
confronted with the U.S. threat of war, bowed to the pressure 
and made an eleventh-hour retreat. NODONG SINMUN strongly 
criticized the action by Khrushchev. North Korea was seized with 
apprehensions that with Khrushchev in power, the protection of 
the Soviet nuclear umbrella could be taken away from it in the 
event of a similar U.S. threat. 
  It was precisely in December that year at the Fifth Plenum 
of 
the Fourth Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee that 
North Korea put forth the Four Military Lines calling for 
self-reliant defenses. The military strategy adopted then was 
essentially sought to thwart the U.S. atomic bomb. 
  Mr "A" continued: "There was only one way to make the U.S. 
atomic bomb good for nothing and it was for them to go 
underground. The Turn-the-Whole-Country-Into-a-Fortress policy 
was basically a `hedgehog tactic,' that is, going underground. 
All installations began moves to as deep as 150-200 meters 
underground. The subway in Pyongyang was no exception." 
  The U.S. nuclear threat increased its pressure on North 
Korea 
in the early 1970's. Especially, at the collapse of South 
Vietnam in 1975, the United States deployed additional tactical 
nuclear weapons in South Korea against a possible invasion by 
the North, even pronouncing that "if the North should invade the 
South, we will crush it with our tactical nuclear weapons." 
Newspapers and broadcasts unhesitatingly reported on the nuclear 
arming of the USFK. 
  "At the time, North Korea was engrossed in the task of 
determining the strength of tactical nuclear weapons deployed to 
the USFK. Materials were gathered from South Korean newspapers, 
broadcasts, and magazines and from authoritative Japanese and 
U.S. newspapers for analytical purposes. Through this work, it 
determined that the number of tactical nuclear weapons as 
referred to in a `Memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs,' was 900 to 1,000," said Mr. "A." 
  Against these historical backdrops, Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il began saying in the mid-1970's that "the key of modern 
warfare is nuclear strategy. The nuclear weapon can be a 
political and military threat." In other words, Pyongyang had 
recognized its military strategic need for nuclear weapons. 
Further, it began viewing nuclear weapons in light of the 
strategy for survival. It was then that the North Korean 
leadership began thinking--vaguely though--that it should come 
to have nuclear weapons. [passage omitted] 
  It can be said that the Manhattan Project and France's TGV 
high-speed train system belongs to this category, the category 
of Big Science. So, which way a country pushes its Big Science 
program has an important bearing on the future of that country. 
  "In North Korea's case, military science--nuclear science in 
particular--must have become an ambitious Big Science program 
for it," says Dr Yun Se-won, 72, a South Korean nuclear science 
pioneer of the Syngman Rhee era. 
  According to scientists who were deeply involved in nuclear 
development in the Pak Chong-hui era, North Korean scientists 
who worked for the nuclear development program, Pyongyang's Big 
Science program, can be divided into the first, second, and 
third generations--those who defected to the North around the 
time of the Korean War forming the first, their children who 
defected to the North with them and who later studied in the 
Soviet Union making up the second, and those who were educated 
in North Korea, then studied in the Soviet Union and who are 
currently working in the nuclear development program 
representing the third generation. 
  Among those viewed as leading first-generation figures who 
must have established a master plan and led the development 
program are To Sang-nok, Yi Sung-ki, and Han In-sok. Their 
personal history follows: 
  To Sang-nok, a native of South Hamgyong Province, majored in 
physics at Tokyo Imperial University [present Tokyo University]. 
On liberation, he returned to Korea and became a Kyongsong 
University [present Seoul National University, SNU] physics 
professor. According to Dr. Cho Sun-tak, 70, former director of 
the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology [KAIST], 
To Sang-nok was his professor in his university days. Professor 
To, he said, had studied two years at Tokyo Imperial University, 
which was then a three-year institute, spending the third year, 
the year for thesis writing, in Korea working as a teacher at 
Songdo Middle School in Kaesong, for financial reasons involving 
his family. Thus, he had to earn his way through the university. 
The thesis he wrote then was about "the Structure of the 
Hydrogen Molecule." 
  After that, To Sang-nok worked as professor of Singyong 
University, established in Manchuria mainly by Tokyo U. 
graduates, until immediately before liberation. On liberation, 
he moved to Kyongsong University. His son, To In-sop, also 
attended the SNU physics course. The father and son are said to 
have defected to the North together. Regarding his work in North 
Korea, Mr. "B," another former North Korean official, said as 
follows: 
  "I understand that while serving as the head of the chair of 
physics in Kim Il-song University, Prof. To was devoted to 
radioisotope research. Through with the pure science stage, his 
research was on military application. Without Soviet aid, he was 
laying the foundations of nuclear energy research almost 
single-handedly. His academic level was so high that those who 
know used to cite as top scientists `To Sang-nok in physics, Yi 
Sung-ki in chemistry, and Kye Ung-sang in sericultural science.' 
In other words, To Sang-nok is the father of nuclear research in 
North Korea." 
  To Sang-nok became an Academician, the highest position for 
a 
scientist in North Korea, and was awarded the titles of Labor 
Hero and People's Scientist. He died in February 1990. 
  Meanwhile, some observers view Dr Yi Sung-ki as having made 
greater contributions to the North Korea nuclear development 
program. They are mostly veteran scientists who know both To 
Sang-nok and Yi Sung-ki well or those who took part in the Pak 
Chong-hui era nuclear development effort. Yi Sung-ki has a 
distinguished record as scientist. 
  A native of Tamyang, South Cholla Province, he majored in 
synthetic fiber at Kyoto University, Japan. He was the second 
SNU president when he defected to the North immediately before 
the Korean War. And by inventing vinalon, a synthetic fiber from 
coal, he became a world-renowned scientist. Besides, Yi Sung-ki 
was known for being broad- and open-minded. So, he had many 
followers in the South, too, it was said. 
  Commenting on his role in the nuclear development program, 
Dr 
Yi Pyong- ho, 70, professor emeritus of the KAIST nuclear 
engineering department, said as follows: 
  "Although it is not very likely that he participated 
directly 
in the nuclear development program, there is no question that he 
must have performed the role of organizing the research team for 
it. He is the top leader of North Korean scientists. When he 
selects people for a project and ask them for cooperation, it 
would be unlikely that they turn him down. Prof. To Sang-nok 
was, basically, a loner-type researcher, while Prof. Yi Sung-ki 
had a great deal of experience in setting up team work in 
research." 
  Moreover, considering the fact that the process of 
extracting 
plutonium for atomic bomb materials is fundamentally a process 
of chemical engineering, and that Kyoto U. is known for being 
most advanced in nuclear physical chemistry, it would not be 
strange if he took part in the nuclear development program. 
  It is officially unknown who was the first director of the 
Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center [NRC]. According to a scientist 
who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear 
development effort, "Yi Sung-ki was the first director" of the 
Yongbyon NRC. "He was not," countered Mr. "B," the former North 
Korean official who testified earlier about To Sang-no. With 
regard to Yi Sung-ki's work in North Korea, the latter said as 
follows: 
  "It is true that of all the scientists in North Korea, Yi 
Sung-ki was trusted most, but he was a chemical engineer known 
for his vinalon research, not a nuclear scientist. He became the 
director of the Research Institute of Chemical Technology right 
after his defection to the North, but soon began devoting 
himself to vinalon research while leaving institute business to 
Yo Kyong-ku, his junior partner. Needless to say, it is not that 
he made no contributions to military science. It should be 
noted, however, that while making all-out efforts for nuclear 
development, North Korea did even more to develop chemical 
weapons. When the Defense College was established in 1962 under 
the Four Military Lines, Yi Sung-ki became its first commandant. 
This put him in military uniform for a while. Thus, I understand 
that while in charge of training scientists and engineers for 
munitions industries, he was deeply involved in chemical weapons 
development." [passage omitted] 
  For his service in solving the problem of clothing for the 
people with his invention of vinalon, Yi Sung-ki was awarded the 
title of Labor Hero and the Lenin Prize in 1962. Currently, he 
is serving as the head of the Hamhung branch of the Academy of 
Sciences. According to Mr. "B," the person who said that Yi 
Sung-ki did not take part in the North Korean nuclear 
development program, "the first director of the Yongbyon NRC was 
Han In-sok." [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, influenced by Dr. Yi Sung-ki, many professors and 
students of the SNU engineering school's chemical engineering 
branch defected to the North. Among those professors were Yo 
Kyong-ku, who went over to the North even before Yi, and Ma 
Hyong-ok, Yi Se-hun, Kim Tae-yol, Yi Chang-chik, and Sin 
Hyon-sok. Also, it is said that it was about that time when Kwon 
Tae-mun, Kim Pyong-chun, and Ok Chi-hun, who were all classmates 
of Ma Kyong-sok, 73, honorary president of the South Korea 
Engineers Club, and second-batch graduates of the chemical 
engineering branch, defected to the North. It is difficult to 
rule out the possibility of those who had majored in chemical 
engineering, a course with possible links to nuclear 
reprocessing, having performed a role in the nuclear development 
program. 
  According to Ma Kyong-sok, he learned some time ago, through 
telephone conversations with Dr Yi Sung-ki and Ok Chi-hun, of 
the Hamhung branch of the Academy of Sciences, that of these 
people, Yo Kyong-ku, Prof. Sin Hyon-sok, and Kwon Tae-mun had 
died. He was also told, Ma said, that Yi Chae-op, a graduate of 
the Kyoto U. chemical engineering course who defected to the 
North before Liberation, and Chang Chil-pyo, his pupil who went 
to the North with him, had married Yi Sung-ki's daughters. 
  Besides Dr. Yi Sung-ki and Prof. To Sang-nok, another person 
who seemed to have played a leading role in the nuclear 
development program is Prof. Han In-sok. A graduate of the 
physics course of Japan's Tohoku University, he studied in 
Germany for a while, then served as physics professor at 
Kyongsong U. It is known that soon after that, he, as one of the 
opponents to the "National University Plan," briefly moved to 
Yonsei University before defecting to the North. 
  According to his pupils who remember him, it is unlikely 
that 
Han In-sok had attracted attention as a preeminent physicist -- 
not in South Korea at least. In the North, however, it seems 
that he stood very much in the spotlight. Mr "B," who said that 
Han In-sok was the first director of the Yongbyon Atomic Energy 
Research Center, explained Han's role in North Korea as follows: 
  "While at Kim Il-song University [KISU] as physics 
professor, 
Han In-sok went to Moscow to study the latest nuclear theories 
for some time. He began giving North Korean leaders, including 
party cadres, lectures on the importance of nuclear energy and 
the need for nuclear development, in the late 1950's. He was 
articulate. In the early 1960's, he put out many theses 
concerning nuclear development. This led to rumors among cadres 
that he was even more capable than To Sang-nok. Han In-sok, 
along with To Sang-nok, can be called the founder of North 
Korea's nuclear physics." 
  In 1965, Han In-sok made public his research paper entitled 
"Distribution of Irregular Speeds of Electrons in Plasma." Dr. 
Yun Se-won, Han's pupil, said he and Han frequently got together 
at parties when they were both professors at Yonsei U. for a 
short period. Yun said: "He was a man of little ambition but of 
great passion and outstanding brains. The only setback was his 
move to Yonsei; he did not get the treatment he deserved while 
there. According to Yun, Prof. Han celebrated his 60th birthday 
about 25 years ago. In an appearance in a broadcast program that 
day, Han said that "I have a pupil in the South," referring to 
him by name, Yun said, adding that "I was deeply impressed." 
  The person who also seemingly performed an important role, 
only next to the roles played by the three, To Sang-nok and Yi 
Sung-ki and Han In- ok, in importance, is none other than Chong 
Kun. According to a nuclear engineer who was deeply involved in 
the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort, "when Dr Yi 
Sung-ki was in charge of organizing the nuclear development 
team, Chong Kun must have acted as the top working aide for him. 
I had felt his such presence on various occasions." 
  Chong Kun, one of the second-batch graduates of the 
Kyongsong 
U. physics course, majored in basic physics, molecular movements 
in particular. It is said that he left for Moscow to study after 
his defection to the North. It was the time when KISU was being 
established. He studied nuclear physics in Moscow, specializing 
in reactor physics, a field directly linked with the nuclear 
development program. On his return from Moscow, he became a 
member of KISU. He is known to have written five or six theses 
on reactors after that. 
  Dr. Cho Sun-tak views Chong Kun as an "extraordinarily 
brilliant person." "When I was involved in a leftist movement," 
Cho said, "I first thought that he belonged to the South Korean 
Labor Party, but later learned that he had belonged to the North 
Korean Workers Party from the beginning." That made him remember 
Chong very clearly, Cho added. Among the theses Chong wrote in 
the 1960's were "Research on Thermoelectric Phenomena," "Thermal 
Diffusion of Neutrons," and "On Minimums of Metallic Resistance 
at Low Temperatures." 
  In addition to the above-listed, scientists like Yo 
Kyong-ku, 
Chon Pyong-su, Kim Yong-ho and Yo Chol-ki are thought, in the 
views of atomic energy-related scholars, to have participated in 
the nuclear development program one way or another, for their 
academic levels. 
  Yo Kyong-ku, nephew of Yo Un-hyong, who majored in applied 
chemistry in Japan's Waseda University, was assistant professor 
of chemical engineering at Kyongsong U. when he made his rather 
early defection to the North. About that time, after learning 
that Dr. Yi Sung-ki was troubled by the "National University 
Plan," he is said to have visited Yi to suggest that he go over 
to the North. In North Korea, Yo Kyong-ku rose to Candidate 
Academician of the Academy of Sciences. He is said to have 
participated in the V-2 rocket development in Okinawa in the 
last days of World War II. 
  Chon Pyong-su, a native of Hamhung who majored in physics in 
Japan's Hokkaido University, briefly served as physics professor 
at Kyongsong U. While in Japan, he was viewed as being so 
extraordinarily brilliant that his professor made him his top 
student, they say. Ideologically, however, he was socialist from 
the beginning. In North Korea, he briefly departed from 
scientific research and joined a political school, even serving 
as the party's top responsible officer at KISU. 
  It is known that after leaving that post, Chon Pyong-su 
shifted from pure research to experiment. Among theses he wrote 
in the 1960's were "On Nuclear Interaction in Nuclear Fluid by 
Particles with Energy," "On Raising Precision in Measurement of 
Each Distribution," and "On Each Distribution of Secondary 
Particles in Nuclear Interaction with Heavy Nucleuses in Nuclear 
Fluid." 
  Kim Yong-ho, who majored in quantum chemistry at Japan's 
Kyoto U., was a chemistry professor at Kyongsong U. when he 
defected to the North. Quantum chemistry is said to have 
connections with nuclear reprocessing facilities. He was also 
reputed to be a very outstanding scientist, they say. 
  Yo Chol-ki, one of the second-batch graduates of the SNU 
physics course, was assistant professor of the university when 
he defected to the North. He is a brother of Yo Sok-ki, who was 
once English literature professor of Korea University. He 
attended a 1990 World Conference of Korean Physicists held at 
Yanbian University in China as chairman of the North Korean 
Physical Society, and accompanied by four persons. He was a 
Candidate Academician of the Academy of Sciences at the time. It 
was then that Dr. Ko Yun-sok, 67, former chairman of the 
Physical Society of the South, met Yo Chol-ki, his 2-year 
senior, for the first time in many years. They talked about many 
things. Of the meeting, Ko said as follows: 
  "He was calm and not particularly argumentative. He was the 
same chain smoker as he was before. His specialty then was 
plasma physics. As I knew it, it was his fourth. He had 
specialized in hydromechanics, then in particle physics, and the 
latest I had heard was that he was studying nuclear physics. The 
fact alone that he was ranging over a number of fields like that 
made me think that he was perhaps assigned some important job. 
Strangely, whenever I asked about some statistics, he kept his 
mouth shut." 
  Besides Yo Chol-ki, North Korean physicists Cho Pyong-nae 
and 
Kim Yong-il, both specializing in statistical mechanical 
physics, attended the conference. Another scientist named Ko 
Yong-hye, specializing in the theory of field at KISU, who 
appeared to be in his fifties, also showed up at the conference. 
  Scientists referred to in the above were mostly Kyongsong U. 
professors in physics or chemical engineering when they defected 
to the North. Leftist leaders at the Kyongsong U. science and 
engineering school in those days were To Sang-nok and Yo 
Kyong-ku, it was said. Although those scientist defectors were 
mostly leftists opposed to the "National University Plan," they 
excelled in scholarship. In the views of atomic energy-related 
scholars, they must have laid North Korea's scientific 
foundations, setting the direction of its nuclear development 
program. 
  Other scientists from the South include Choe Sam-yol, a 
graduate of the Tohoku U. chemistry course, who served as 
professor of KISU and later became an Academician, and Yi 
Chae-yong, a graduate of the Kyoto U. fuel chemistry course. 
These people went straight to North Korea while they were 
overseas for study purposes. In the views of atomic energy 
scientists in the South, it is possible that they also 
participated in North Korea's Big Science project, the nuclear 
development program. 
  Forming another group are second-generation scientists who 
were trained by the above-listed seniors and who could have 
performed the central role in the nuclear development program. 
Among them are Choe Hak-kun, Yun Ho-chin and Kye Yong-sun. 
  Choe Hak-kun, a native of Hamgyong Province, is a nuclear 
expert who went to Moscow University from KISU, then to the 
Dubna NRC. Following his return home, he served as the second 
director of the Yongbyon NRC, then as minister of the Ministry 
of Atomic Energy Industry, which was created within the State 
Administration Ministry in December 1986. He also served as 
counselor in Vienna for 4 years from 1975, when North Korea 
joined the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Dr. Yi Pyong-hwi, 64, former director of the Atomic Energy 
Bureau of the [ROK] Ministry of Science and Technology, and IAEA 
board member for 1977 through 1983, was Choe Hak-kun's 
counterpart in Vienna. North Korean officials in Vienna usually 
moved around in a pair; on rare occasions when Choe met with Dr. 
Yi by himself, he always was inquisitive about the state of 
atomic energy in South Korea, said Dr. Yi. 
  At the time, one of the three secretary-level officials -- 
graduates of KISU physics, metal engineering, and chemical 
engineering departments respectively -- alternately came from 
Pyongyang to work under Choe Hak-kun. They were seen frequenting 
at the IAEA library, where detailed information were available 
on blueprints of, and construction methods used for, atomic 
reactors that had been built in various parts of the world. Dr. 
Yi continued: 
  "Over there, one could obtain the entire information needed 
to build an atomic reactor in 1 or 2 years if he was determined 
to do so. Suppose North Korea had spent about 4 years making 
such preparations, the 5-megawatt-class Yongbyon No. 2 atomic 
reactor was possibly built in early 1980. Give it enough time 
for a good trial run and inspection, say 7 years, then the 
reactor could possibly be put in operation in 1988." 
  Dr. Yi also noted that "at any rate, the massive data thus 
gathered at the time must have been used for the nuclear 
development program." He added that "Choe Hak-kun is believed to 
have played a significant role in that process." Meanwhile, 
since North Korea's entry into the IAEA, Choe Hak-kun 
intensified his demand for the "denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula." 
  Yun Ho-chin, resident officer in Vienna, was responsible for 
administrative affairs concerning the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] and the inspection issue. A graduate of the KISU 
physics department, he also had extensive knowledge about 
nuclear power. Once he was engaged in a heated debate with 
Ambassador Kennedy, the ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary of the U.S. State Department on NPT issues. 
According to Dr. Yi, who was listening to the debate, it seemed 
that no one could beat Yun in argument. He is a specialist who 
is, in effect, in charge of external affairs concerning the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Kye Yong-sun, a KISU gradate, who also studied in the Dubna 
NRC, is a key figure in North Korea's nuclear power plant 
construction. It was he who first suggested that "we build 
nuclear power plants for ourselves" in early 1970, they say. Kye 
Hyong-sun, former minister of machine-building industry, 
regarded as the godfather of North Korea's munitions industry, 
is his elder brother, they say. 
  Under these second-generation scientists, there are 
third-generation specialists who returned from the former Soviet 
Union and are currently active on the first line of the nuclear 
development program. Their names are mostly unknown. 
Fortunately, Mr "B," the former high official in North Korea, 
knew one of them -- Yi Yun-song, alias Yi Yun-su. 
  Yi Yun-song, a very bright boy since his childhood, went to 
Moscow U. the year after his graduation from KISU, obtaining a 
Ph.D in physics at the age of 31. On his return from Moscow, he 
served as a professor at Pyongsong Institute of Science before 
moving to the Yongbyon NRC. He should be about 50 years old and, 
if he still is with the NRC, he could be at the level of a 
section chief. 
  The people mentioned above are part of the North Korean 
brains in the nuclear development program as we came to know 
about from information provided by atomic energy scientists and 
intelligence agencies in our country and by people who formerly 
served in high posts in North Korea. They of course represent 
only a small part of the picture. It is a limitation we face, 
but there is a way to overcome it a little bit. 
  It is by using our judgement on the basis of theses written 
by North Korean scientists. Agencies in the South reportedly 
used the same method for some time to measure levels of the 
North Korean nuclear development program. Basically, however, it 
is difficult to gain access to such theses. The Korean division 
of the National Archives of the U.S. Congress is known to be the 
only place in the West that provides access to theses by North 
Korean scientists. 
  Even so, it is limited to the period through the early 
1970's. Entering the 1970's, North Korea apparently tightened 
control over the handling of theses as it embarked on its 
nuclear development program. Those available at the National 
Archives are said to be the result of a volunteer's efforts who 
collected them in Hong Kong despite great difficulties. 
  The theses kept in the National Archives are by 100-odd 
scientists, mostly published between the 1950's and the early 
1970's. They include many by the previously mentioned 
scientists. Most of the theses were printed in KWAHAGWON TONGBO 
[ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT], which is a highest-level journal 
published in North Korea. About half of them only deal with 
mathematics while the rest are doing researches based on 
experiments. Considering the fact that they were by North Korean 
scientists in the period through the early 1970's, and that the 
nuclear development program has been Pyongyang's Big Science 
undertaking, it can be said that a considerably large number of 
the authors probably participated in the nuclear development 
program. 
  Dr. Chong Sun-tak, who examined the theses, said "their 
research seems to cover fields such as high energy, solid-state 
physics, statistical physics, hydrodynamics, astrophysics, and 
even atomic nucleus. In respect to experiments, it appears that 
organized research with links to defense and industry were under 
way." The following is a look at some of those scientists who 
have published relatively many theses, their post at the time 
and their representative thesis: 

  -  Kim Kyong-chong, assistant 
professor, engineering, B.A.; "Heat Transfer Between the Fixed 
Bed and the Heat-Exchange Wall" (1966) 
  -  Kim Myong-nin, 
engineering, B.A.; "On Mechanism of Interaction Between 
Manganese Oxides and Sulphurous Acid Gas in Water Solution" 
(1966) 
  -  Kim In-sik, candidate academician, engineering; 
"Experiment of Pellet Melting by Various Chemical Catalysts in 
the Electric Furnace" (1961) 
  -  Kim Hyong-nak, assistant professor, 
chemistry, B.A.; "New Calculating Method in Chemical Analyses 
Using Formation Reaction of Adherent Compounds" (1967) 
  -  Yi 
Myong-ha, physical mathematics, B.A.; "On Energy Loss of Charged 
Particles with Magnetic Moment in Plasma" (1964) 
  -  Yi Yon, 
physics, B.A.; "Statistical Dynamical Instability in the 
Combination of the Atomic Nucleus" (1965) 
  -  So Sang-kuk, physics, 
B.A.; "On Phenomenological Quantum Electrodynamics of the Scalar 
Particle" (1964) 
  -  Chong Kye-son, physical mathematics, B.A.; 
"Effect of Plastic Deformation to High-Temperature Internal 
Friction" (1967) 
  Among other physicists and chemists whose theses are found 
in 
the National Archives are: Kang Ho-ung, physics, B.A.; Kwak 
Tae-hung, professor, engineering, Ph.D.; Kim Nae-su, chemistry, 
B.A.; Kim Tal-won, engineering, B.A.; Kim Yong-hum, assistant 
professor, engineering, B.A.; Kim Il-tae, chemistry, B.A.; Kim 
Chae-kil, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Chong-tok, assistant professor, 
physics, B.A.; Kim Chun-ul, assistant professor, engineering, 
B.A.; Kim Chun-hwan, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Hyong-nak, assistant 
professor, chemistry, B.A.; Yu Chong-kun, assistant professor, 
engineering; Yi Mun- yong, engineering, B.A.; Yi Pang-kun, 
engineering, B.A.; Yi Song-chun, assistant professor, 
engineering; Yi Yong-tae, physics, B.A.; Yi Chae- pok, assistant 
professor, physical mathematics, B.A.; Yi Hyo-chin, engineering, 
B.A.; Pae Nae-sop, assistant professor, engineering; Paek 
Yong-kon, physics, B.A.; Pyon Yong-nip, physical mathematics, 
B.A.; Sin Mun-kyu, engineering, B.A.; Sin Pyong-chong, 
engineering, B.A.; Sin Tae- kon, engineering, B.A.; Sin 
Taek-hui, assistant professor, engineering; Om Song-nok, 
engineering, B.A.; Yu Song-chol, engineering, B.A.; Cho Yong-uk, 
physics, B.A.; Cho Chol-hui, engineering, B.A.; Choe Sok-kwon, 
chemistry, B.A.; Hong Sun-tae, engineering, B.A.; Hong Ha-kyong, 
chemistry, B.A. 
  In addition, there were scientists brought in from overseas, 
mostly Korean residents in foreign countries. Explaining, Mr. 
"B" said: 
  "I understand that quite a few overseas Korean nuclear 
scientists entered North Korea. In most cases, they were 
residents either in the Soviet Union or Japan. For them, 
separate research facilities were set up, mainly in Kanggye and 
Hyesan in Chagang Province where many weapons production bases 
were located, as well as in the vicinity of Pyongyang. I 
understand that in the cases of well-known figures, some were 
assigned to the National Defence and Science Institute." 
  Of those from Japan, some stayed on in North Korea taking 
part in the development program while others shuttled between 
the two countries. The Korean Scientists and Engineers 
Association in Japan (Kwahyop) served as the channel. Kwahyop's 
slogan was "Promote Scientific Research and Technological 
Development of Korean Scientists in Japan and Contribute to 
North Korea's Construction." 
  More than 100 executives and members of Kwahyop are 
reportedly playing key roles in advanced science and technology 
divisions of Japanese universities and corporations. Among them 
are scientists working in nuclear fusion, control engineering 
and accelerator fields or even taking part in nuclear technology 
development programs. 
  Dr. Kyong Won-ha is one of them whose name is frequently 
mentioned in conversations concerning Korean scientists who went 
to North Korea from Japan. He is known to have participated in 
the atomic bomb building at the Los Alamos laboratory in New 
Mexico, then served as professor at Canada's McGill University 
before moving to North Korea in about 1974. But a check with 
atomic energy-related scientists and people who formerly 
serviced in high posts in North Korea revealed that none of them 
had any knowledge about him. 
  At a time when information is as scarce as it is, the 
foregoing list could represent a small, first step in our 
attempt to get a more comprehensive picture of human 
relationships in the North Korean nuclear development program. 
  North Korea's training system for nuclear-related talents 
also deserves careful attention. The training began at a 
university level. The first nuclear physics course was 
established in 1949 before the Korean War. "That year, North 
Korea's first nuclear physics course was created within the KISU 
physics school and 30 students were selected for it," said Mr 
"B." 
  It was also in 1949 when Pyongyang began sending students to 
Moscow U. and St. Petersburg University. Needless to say, they 
were not all nuclear physics students. Suppose 30 students left 
for Moscow or St. Petersburg in any given year, three to four of 
them were nuclear physics students. Choe Hak-kun, former 
minister of atomic energy industry, is said to have been one of 
the first-group students who went to Moscow. 
  The KISU nuclear physics course was closed temporarily 
during 
the war but reopened later. After that, in about 1957, a nuclear 
engineering department, made up by three courses, was created in 
Kim Chaek Institute of Technology [KCIT]. The number of students 
was 50. Further, in 1963, a nuclear physics course was opened in 
Pyongsong Institute of Science in South Pyongan Province, a 
college under the control of the Academy of Sciences, accepting 
50 students. Pyongsong is a North Korean science town similar to 
Taedok Science Town in the South, and its Institute of Science 
is an equivalent of our Institute of Science and Technology. 
  There are slight differences between the roles performed by 
these three institutes. While they are all for the study of 
nuclear physics, KISU is dedicated to both theoretical and 
technological researches, KCIT trains technical personnel and 
Pyongsong trains scientists, research officers and professors 
primarily in fundamental theoretical fields. Besides, a nuclear 
engineering department was created in the National Defense 
College in Hyesan in about 1963, primarily for the training of 
specialists in munitions and weaponry. 
  Basically through these four institutes, North Korea has 
systematically trained its personnel since the 1950's. The 
length of their nuclear physics courses is 7 years, they say, 
and they accept only bright students. 
  On this point, Mr. "B" said: "They take only students of 
I.Q. 
160 or higher. Children of state cadres who are bright enough 
are required to take the nuclear physics course mandatorily even 
if it is against their wish. Once, there were moves among 
students to avoid taking the course as those who willingly had 
entered the course first saw graduates assigned to Yongbyon or 
military-related research institutes. Circulating rumors had it 
that once they entered the course, their coming and going would 
be restricted and, more seriously, they could be exposed to 
radioactivity. Once there was a case in which one of the cadres 
prevented his child from applying for the course, and when the 
fact was discovered by authorities, he was reassigned to a 
remote forestry station. Since that time, if a student would 
avoid applying for the nuclear physics course, he or she would 
be sent to the countryside or otherwise called to task for it." 
  Attached to these institutes are, respectively, "the KISU 
Nuclear Physics Research Institute," "the KCIT Nuclear Physics 
Research Institute," and "the Nuclear Physics Research Institute 
of the Academy of Sciences." The KISU Nuclear Physics Research 
Institute has a long history of research in radioactive isotope. 
  Other major research institutes are mostly lactated in the 
Yongbyon complex. They include the "Atomic Energy Research 
Institute," "Radioactivity Prevention Research Institute," and 
"Nuclear Power Generating Research Institute." The Yongbyon 
nuclear complex was created in the late 1950's. North Korea 
began its expansion in earnest in 1962 after the fifth plenum of 
the fourth party Central Committee. 
  Beginning in the 1960's, North Korean institutes turned out 
nuclear scientists in large numbers who were trained by 
themselves through those 7-year courses. Some of the graduates 
left for Moscow for further studies, mostly at the Dubna NRC. 
Scores of them were sent there each year in rotation; their stay 
in Dubna ranging from 2-3 years to over 10 years. There they, 
along with scientists from other socialist nations, jointly 
participated in the Soviet nuclear development program. 
  The cases of those who had stayed there for more than 10 
years were because their research achievements were so 
outstanding that the Dubna NRC would not let them go home. 
Occasionally, there were minor disputes over persons whose 
homecoming ran into difficulties for such reasons. Among them 
were many who had obtained Soviet doctorates at the age of 30 
and became an object of envy. So, Soviet scientists, knowing 
about their abilities more than anyone else, would never 
underestimate the levels of North Korean students, it is said. 
At times, students were deported back home from Dubna because of 
their persistent attempt to spy on advanced Soviet nuclear 
technology. 
  North Korean students were also sent to the Kurchatov NRC, 
the Kiev NRC and the Ioffe NRC. While Dubna was for basic 
research in nuclear physics, Kurchatov was known as a laboratory 
for experimenting and building nuclear bombs. They were all 
secret facilities off limits to unauthorized citizens as well as 
foreigners. 
  Dr. Yi Pyong-hwi happened to be allowed to visit the 
Kurchatov Nuclear Physics Research Center, a secret facility, 
for 1 week in 1992. Named after Dr. Kurchatov, who led the team 
that built and tested the first Soviet nuclear bomb in 1949, the 
center stands about 20 kilometers from downtown Moscow. 
  Dr. Yi was amazed at research facilities at the center. 
Nuclear fusion, remote control and radioactivity lab facilities 
appeared to be incomparably more sophisticated and advanced than 
those at the Argonne National Laboratory where the Manhattan 
Project was conducted. The world's most advanced installation, 
however, had come to a complete standstill because of Russia's 
economic collapse. 
  Consequently, the United States is reportedly working on 
economic aid for improvement in the treatment of Russian nuclear 
scientists so as to prevent their exodus from the country. "It 
is quite possible," Dr. Yi speculated, "that quite a few of 
those Russian nuclear scientists who had been to North Korea in 
the past, returned there in 1989 or 1990 during the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and just stayed on there." 
  North Korea also sent scientists to China, which 
successfully 
conducted its first atomic bomb test in 1964, although fewer in 
numbers than those sent to the Soviet Union. For exchanges with 
Chinese nuclear physicists, Pyongyang sent its specialists to 
Xiangshan Zhao Dai Suo in Beijing where those Chinese frequently 
get together. Pyongyang also sent scientists to the Xinjiang 
explosion test site to learn explosion technique. Thus trained 
through various routes, the number of North Korean nuclear 
experts and technical personnel is now estimated at 
approximately more than 5,000, including 200 trained at Dubna. 
  The systematic training like this showed its first results 
in 
the development of missiles. North Korea produced on its own a 
short-range rocket missile using nuclear energy in the late 
1960's. To share the excitement, a demonstration firing was 
conducted for 2 hours in November 1970 before some 1,000 party 
delegates who arrived from all over the country for the Fifth 
Party Congress, according to reports. 
  Pyongyang's nuclear policy came to the fore in March 1974 
when Kim Il-song told a National Industrial Workers Meeting that 
"we must build nuclear power plants on our own." Thus, North 
Korea, with its own technology, embarked on the construction of 
No. 2 reactor, a 30 megawatt-class reactor by the graphite 
moderator gas coolant method, in Yongbyon in 1980, completing it 
in 1987. 
  In addition to an army of nuclear talents thus trained, 
North 
Korea has uranium ore deposits scattered all over the country, a 
factor that made possible the nuclear development on its own. 
The development of the large-scale Pyongsan and Pakchon mines 
began in the 1950's, and the Sunchon and Songchon mines are 
known for high uranium purity. Other uranium mines include one 
at Unggi, North Hamgyong Province, and the Kujang Mine in Mt. 
Myohyang. It is also known that there are a number of them in 
the vicinity of Hyesan and Hamhung. 
  Although North Korea had to send ores to the Soviet Union 
for 
processing before the 1960's, it later built its own smelting 
plants near mines for independent processing. Then the 
prospecting drive for uranium ores, they say, spread to other 
parts of the country so widely that slogans like "Find the 
Bluish-Black Mineral" became popular among prospecting workers. 
  Yongbyon is geographically very close to Pakchon. Thus, it 
has a uranium mine a short distance away and, surrounded by 
Kuryong River and Mt. Kuryong, has a security advantage, plus 
natural water of good quality. It reportedly was the 
unquestioned top candidate when authorities were looking for a 
site for the nuclear development complex. When the project got 
under way, residents were relocated elsewhere. 
  Yongbyon was gradually turned into a secret town. Guard 
posts 
were erected around the complex, which was then put off limits 
to unauthorized persons. Security measures made were so tight 
that they were simply beyond imagination. Except for workers 
there and Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, and the chief of the 
general staff of the KPA, no one is allowed to enter the complex 
without authorization, including high-ranking cadres and 
politburo members. Even Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are of 
course not completely free to enter the facility. On this point, 
Mr. "A" said: 
  "There is a check point at the Kuryong River bridge leading 
to the Yongbyon complex. Even the car carrying Kim Il-song 
and/or Kim Chong-il must stop at the point. Officials from the 
complex in another car meet them there. The visitor(s) then 
would get in their car and go through the point. The facility is 
off limits even to the aide-chauffeur for the visitor(s). 
Security is that tight." 
  Personnel are also under strict security control. 
Researchers 
are usually not authorized to leave the complex. When one is 
allowed to leave for a compelling reason, e.g.,the death of a 
parent, he will be shadowed by two or three security men of the 
Ministry of National Defense, they say. Telephones and mail to 
and from the complex are out of question. Even for 
communications with the Atomic Energy Committee, the facility 
uses a courier. On the other hand, the complex has every 
facility needed for the daily life of people there, they say. 
  When the need arises for building facilities inside the 
complex, a special team of the 105th construction unit under the 
Ministry of Public Security is assigned to it. The unit itself 
is a special one assigned to such works as repair of the houses 
of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, the Pyongyang subway or special 
tunnels. So, there is absolutely no way for outside people to 
know what is going on inside the complex. 
  "Considering the fact that major North Korean facilities 
have 
gone underground, facilities that have been put to the 
international inspections are only those that had been made 
public. It is reasonable to think that there are other 
facilities that have not been made public," said Mr. "A." In 
addition, it is known that there are many underground plants in 
Taechon, only eight km from Yongbyon, he added. 
  Nuclear physics research institutes attached to universities 
in general are also under strict security. They are off limits 
to unauthorized people and telephone calls are impossible. When 
people come out with personal belongings, they are checked by 
defense department personnel each time, they say. These 
institutes are under the control of the WPK Science and 
Education Department. Also, personnel of this department are 
known to enter the institutes once or twice a year when party 
meetings are held to sum up their activities. Persons found to 
have leaked secret information are separated and sent to remote 
places in the mountains. 
  Mr. "A" said he would like to point out a misconception 
which 
he comes across so frequently in discussions about the North 
Korean nuclear issue. It is that because of the current economic 
crisis, Pyongyang would be unable to continue the enormously 
expensive nuclear development program. It is indeed a capitalist 
perception, he went on, but the fact is that in North Korea, 
they can carry out any project only by paying the personnel 
expenses, and if that should become difficult, even by just 
giving workers enough to eat. 
  Materials needed for the nuclear development program are 
mostly available domestically. The only thing they had to buy 
from outside was equipment from the Soviets. Even for them, 
North Korea could solve the payment problem by, extremely 
speaking, mobilizing military personnel for free labor at gold 
mines and refining facilities and handing over nuggets to the 
Soviets, Mr. "A" said, adding that although digging a tunnel, 
for instance, costs dearly in the South, it can be done 
virtually free in North Korea by mobilizing people's labor.

  [Text] Seoul (NAEWOE) -- Having established three laws 
including "The Foreigners' Investment Law" last October, North 
Korea, which has recently been actively pursuing economic 
cooperation with foreign countries, established three more laws 
including "The Foreign Exchange Control Law" last February to 
complement the system related to investment. But it appears to 
have failed to realize the anticipated results, as usual, due to 
the poor investment climate and imperfect laws. 
  More than one year after the laws related to foreigners' 
investments were established, the economic trade group of Nampo 
City, North Korea, visited the Korean Autonomous Government of 
Yanbian on the 11th of the month, calling for economic trade and 
joint ventures. Even last July, Pak Hwa-ryong, Vice-Chairman of 
Administrative Economic Committee of North Hamkyong Province is 
said to have visited here to explain the construction of the 
Chongjin-Najin and Chongjin-Hoeryong Expressways. This means 
North Korea devotes all its energies to expanding the social 
overhead capital to invite foreign investment. In addition, it 
concluded with China an "Economic Trade Cooperation Protocol" 
the gist of which is to activate border trade, etc., and an 
"Agreement to Construct Railroads and Harbors on the Tumen," and 
made a contract for the development of the Najin-Sonbong area 
which will cost $100 million and involve 21 Russian enterprises, 
they say. 
  Since the Cooperation Law was established in 1984, North 
Korea has been said to explain the inactivity of foreign 
investment as due not only to the poor infrastructure but also 
to the imperfect investment system. Accordingly, as measures 
following the three Laws, the "Foreigners' Investment Law," 
"Joint Venture Law," and "Foreigners' Enterprise Law," which 
were established last year, North Korea established the 
"Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law," 
"Foreign Exchange Control Law," and "Free Economic Trade Zone 
Law" last February to invite foreign investment, they say. But 
North Korea's laws on foreign investment are abstract and 
mutually inconsistent--possibly the general trend of socialist 
states' laws. The three laws established at the beginning of 
this year are also seen as more logically complemented and 
followed by additional legislative measures. 
  Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law 
(Chapter 8, Article 57). This is a basic law related to taxes 
which should be paid by foreigners' investment enterprises or 
foreigners performing economic activities within the North 
Korean territory. It prescribes income-, property-, 
inheritance-, sales-, and local taxes, as well as related 
sanctions and exemptions. Because this law has many points 
conflicting with established cooperation companies' and 
foreigners' income tax laws and their detailed rules, some 
provisions of the law seem to lose their validity on the 
principle of the priority of the new law. 
  The causes of inactivity are inconsistent laws and poor 
infrastructure. North Korea levies graduated income tax rates on 
foreign enterprises -- 25% (general area) and 14% 
(free 
economic trade zone) of the settled rate of interest. It is 
known that the law levies lower tax rates than those (30% 
and 
15%) of China, which it views as a rival. And it 
prescribes 
that foreigners staying more than one year pay personal income 
tax on income from outside as well as inside the territory 
(Article 17). Although North Korea has more favorable tax rates 
on enterprises than does China, it levies more unfavorable 
income tax rates on private persons. This seems to negatively 
influence foreign investment plans. 
  Property tax is levied on buildings, ships and aircraft in 
North Korea (Article 25). Inheritance tax is levied not only 
inside but outside of North Korea (Article 31). This seems to be 
a step to confiscate assets that residents repatriate from Japan 
and those of Japanese wives residing in North Korea who inherit 
from their families in Japan. But as the provisions of the law 
apply to "Korean residents residing outside the territory of the 
Republic who perform economic activities within its territory," 
questions are raised as to whether the provisions apply to South 
Korean enterprises. Because North Korea has thus far insisted 
politically on the concept of "One Korea," the territory of the 
"Republic" as the whole Korean peninsula, some say that South 
Korea is included in the territory of the "Republic." In the 
Cooperation Law, the first law related to foreign investment, 
its application is to be limited to "foreign enterprises and 
individuals" and "Korean residents abroad including Korean 
merchants and industrialists in Japan," clearly eliminating 
South Korean enterprises from participation. But in the laws on 
foreigners' investments established after last year, the subject 
of application, unlike the Cooperation Law, is prescribed to be 
"Korean residents residing outside of the territory of the 
Republic." Accordingly, a dominant opinion is that it allows 
South Korean enterprises (and individuals) to participate. A 
noticeable problem is how North Korea interprets this in 
connection with the idea of "One Korea." 
  In addition, even if South Korean enterprises are subject to 
the laws in the same way as foreign enterprises, a question is 
raised as to which of the two, the North-South Fundamental 
Agreement or these laws, is applied to South Korean enterprises 
when the North levies taxes. It is prescribed in the laws that 
foreign enterprises and individuals should observe the agreement 
concluded by their government and North Korea's government on 
taxes when the agreement is different from the laws (Article 
17). In relation to this provision, when the North-South Joint 
Economic Cooperation Committee concludes agreements on dual 
taxation prevention and investment promotion, will such an 
exception in the laws be applied even to South Korean 
enterprises? 
  Because the North-South Fundamental Agreement is applicable, 
the North and South are in "a special relationship which is not 
one between nations." If South Korean enterprises are not 
subject to the exceptional provision (Article 17) of the law due 
to the special relationship, they may have more unfavorable 
liability to taxation than other countries. 
  Free Economic Trade Zone Law (Chapter 7, Article 43). This 
is 
a basic law that regulates foreign investment in the 
Najin-Sonbong area, which is called a small golden triangle, and 
another free economic trade zone which will be designated in the 
future. The law prescribes the authority and duties of an agency 
to manage the area, maintenance of circumstances for economic 
activities, tariffs, currency, finance, security and preference, 
and settlement of disputes, etc. The law reflects North Korea's 
intentions to make good use of the free economic trade zone as a 
window for opening their economy by bestowing tax privileges on 
business activities and opening up foreign exchange markets to 
foreigners within the zone. The law stipulates that the 
organizations which develop and manage the zone are the Foreign 
Economic Committee of the central government and the local 
authorities. By the suggestion that the central government is 
one organization which controls and leads the open-economy 
policy, it has been made clear what organization takes charge of 
the policy. 
  Because the law mandates that foreign enterprises should, 
even in the zone, employ and dismiss manpower on contracts made 
with North Korean manpower supply organizations, inflexibility 
of labor management has been raised as a major potential 
problem. And every account must settled in Korean "Won" or 
convertible foreign currency. This will mean North Korea will 
aim at collecting foreign currency. 
  Foreign Exchange Control Law (Chapter 4, Article 31). This 
law outlines the general rules and system of foreign currency 
transactions, foreign securities issues, movement of foreign 
currency in and out of the country, securities and precious 
metals, etc. 
  Carrying foreign currency into the country is not limited. 
But approval by the foreign currency management agency is 
required for its removal, except for currency reported when 
entering the country and foreign currency within the free 
economic trade zone. This seems to be aimed at increasing 
foreign exchange reserves. 
  Foreign investment enterprises are strictly required to keep 
accounts with the Trade Bank or banks designated by the foreign 
currency management agency and report their foreign exchange 
situation to the agency quarterly and annually. This system 
means that foreign enterprises should raise their necessary 
foreign exchange by exporting or borrowing from foreign 
countries, and they cannot systematically convert Korean Won 
profit made in the domestic market to hard currency. 
  Even in the three laws established this year, there appears 
the intention of North Korea to carry forward only "an open-door 
policy under strict control," under the closed and rigid 
structure as usual. Even if the laws related to foreign 
investment are improved, as long as the economic structure and 
system are not reformed, the investment climate will not 
materialize, and accordingly, the success of an open-economy 
policy cannot be expected.

  [Excerpts] 
<H8>  1. The Publishing Begins </H8>
  It is asserted that the number of Kim Chong-il's writings 
presented and published up to now amount to a total of over 400 
works. Of these, the titles have been revealed for over 230 
works and the full text confirmed for over 170. Most of Kim 
Chong-il's writings of thesis size are published in 
single-volume booklet form. As for complete-works-type 
publications, at present only the two-volume Kim Chong-il 
Selected Works has been published. As of yet, they have not 
been systematized into a form such as the "Selected Works" or 
"Collection of Works" of Kim Il-song. 
  It appears that most of Kim Chong-il's writings are 
statements he has made, such as working-level guidance, on-site 
guidance, and oral instructions, recorded by secretaries in 
charge of ideology and theory. These then pass through 
correction and supplementation and are published as addresses or 
conclusions. This is often seen when a work is first made public 
in NODONG SINMUN. Its contents are introduced without revealing 
its title; the title is presented at some later time. 
  Writings by Kim Chong-il first appeared officially in 1982. 
The publication of his works has progressed systematically, 
closely connected with the construction of Kim Chong-il's 
succession. Establishing a broad principle, called the 
"character standard," and three rules, being founded in popular 
support, electing a figure from the new generation, and electing 
the next leader while the leader [Kim Il-song] lives, as the 
fundamental principles for electing a successor, North Korea 
[NK] has been highlighting Kim Chong-il as the person fitting 
these principles. Presenting three elements as characteristics 
the leader must have--extraordinary foresight, lofty moral 
character, and superior leadership ability--NK has especially 
attempted to create the image of Kim Chong-il as figure in which 
these three elements are combined. 
  The publication and propagation of Kim Chong-il's writings 
are indispensable means of publicizing his "extraordinary 
foresight." NK has pursued the publication of Kim Chong-il's 
writings by calling him a "genius of ideological theory" and a 
"master of ideological theory," to make him into an ideological 
theoretician by stressing his intellectual side. Although 
publishing his works is fundamentally a means of publicizing his 
talent as an ideological theorist, because presentation of 
policy for each sector of society, such as combative slogans, 
literary guidance, economic-construction guidance, etc., is 
achieved through the publishing of these works, it also displays 
his "superior leadership ability." Furthermore, these writings 
on each sector of society, by showing Kim Chong-il's great 
concern, also publicize his "lofty moral character." 
  That Kim Chong-il's works were first published in 1982 is 
not 
unrelated to his succession was firmly established at this time. 
Emerging as the heir to power in the October 1980 Sixth Party 
Congress, Kim Chong-il began concrete, working-level guidance in 
May 1981. He also tried to create opportunities to strengthen 
his power base in the political sector, such as becoming a 
representative of the Songnim District, North Hwanghae Province 
in the Seventh General Election of the Supreme People's Assembly 
held on February 28, 1982. We can take the view that the 
publication of his writings began in 1982 as a way to secure a 
political base by publicizing his talent for thinking as a 
successor. [passage omitted] 
<H8>  2. The Three Stages of Publication </H8>
  Publishing Kim Chong-il's writings was carried out in three 
stages, according to analysis. The first stage was from 1982 
through 1984: works capable of being used as policy guides in 
each sector of NK society were presented and published. The 
second stage was the publishing conducted between 1985 and 1987. 
In this stage, a reconstruction of Kim Chong-il's past 
activities was attempted by finding past, unpublished writings 
and retroactively publishing them. The third stage began in 1988 
and at present, in 1993, is ongoing. With Kim Chong-il's 
succession in mind, the transfer of the leader image of Kim 
Il-song, the creation of the legitimacy of his regime, and the 
concrete publication of his works are being carried out. 
<H5>  A. Stage One: Publication of Basic Policy Platform and </H5>
Expansion of Kim Chong-il's Power Base 
  The publication of Kim Chong-il's writings beginning in 1982 
saw the publication of his main writings, to be used as policy 
guides in each sector of society, by the end of 1984. This was 
the first stage of publication. That is, from 1982 through 1984 
NK caused his political influence to be felt, from everyday life 
to the workplace, by replacing with Kim Chong-il's writings 
teachings necessarily quoted in each area of society, on Chuche 
Thought, party construction, the economy, youth activities, art, 
education, the military, etc., and by having these studied in 
each neighborhood unit, workplace and school, and by clarifying 
them through debates and rallies. 
  In order to obtain authority as the successor to Kim Il-song 
in NK, more than anything else, he must secure the right to 
interpret with authority the official ideology of NK society, 
Chuche Thought. This is the first consideration for qualifying 
as the leader in this socialist society ruled by ideology. In 
this context, Kim Chong-il organized and systematized theory on 
Chuche Thought previously alluded to by Kim Il-song, presenting 
and publishing his thesis entitled, On Chuche Thought. 
  Kim Chong-il's second thesis, The [Korean] Workers 
Party is a Chuche-Type Revolutionary Party which Inherited the 
Glorious "Down With Imperialism Union" Tradition , was 
published on three pages of the October 17, 1982 NODONG SINMUN. 
This was to display another quality he must have as a leader: an 
anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition and insight on party 
building. In an editorial four days later, NODONG SINMUN quoted 
it as one of Kim Chong-il's teachings. Using the name, "Party 
Center," seven times and "Kim Chong-il" seven times, it greatly 
emphasized his position. 
  A thesis, On Further Improving the People's Lives 
published on 16 Feb 84 played a very important role in Kim 
Chong-il securing the legitimacy of his regime. Since it was 
published, all NK economic policies have come to quote this 
thesis and all economic policy success since then has been 
completely credited to him. His image was further strengthened 
with the report that the results of the "August 3rd People's 
Consumer-Goods Increased Production Movement" to improve the 
people's lives, the Kwangbok-kori and Tongil-kori construction 
to increase the number of housing complexes, etc., were achieved 
based on the teachings of this thesis. 
  In July 1984, with the presentation and publication of 
On Further Strengthening Party Leadership of the Youth 
Enterprise and On Further Developing the Educational 
Enterprise, policy guidance was presented covering the 
whole of national education. Another work small in size but 
treated as important by the military was published in April 
1984: The People's Armed Forces Must Defend with Their 
Lives Their Leader and Party, Their System and Fatherland. 
Although no works have been published on unification, The 
Leader Kim Chong-il, published in two volumes in 1984, not 
only depicts him as having deep interest in unification too, but 
it also publicizes that he has led the formation of various 
unification-related social organizations since the Koryo Federal 
System was proposed in 1980. 
  Together with the publication of his writings, the process 
of 
Kim Chong-il's political position becoming secure from October 
1982, when his writings began to be published, through 1984 can 
be confirmed through NODONG SINMUN. Kim Chong-il's name started 
to be introduced on NODONG SINMUN's front page with the October 
22, 1982 issue. Beginning in 1983, the frequency of its 
appearance increased. By November 1984, it reached its present 
form, in which articles on Kim Chong-il's recent situation and 
the publication of his writings are headlined on page one of 
NODONG SINMUN. This signifies that stage one of the publication 
of his works begun in October 1982 came to a conclusion in 1984. 
  In stage one, the work of highlighting Kim Chong-il's 
leadership image was carried out in parallel, by converting into 
the achievements of Kim Chong-il those for which the credit had 
formerly been given to Kim Il-song: the achievement of the 
various popular movements, such as the "Campaign To Create 
Examples of Loyalty Learned By Following Lathe Number 26," 
"Three Revolutions Red Flag Movement," "Three-Revolution Team 
Movement," "Production, Study, and Life--All in the Manner of 
the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas," etc. Also, in this process, the 
fact that a "semi-war state" was proclaimed in February 1983 has 
similar aspects with the "semi-war-state" proclamation made 
prior to Kim Chong-il's appointment as National Defense 
Committee Chairman in March 1993. This can be seen as a measure 
taken to help minimize internal side effects resulting from 
pushing his succession forward. 
<H5>  B. Stage Two: Retroactive Publishing and the Creation of a </H5>
Successor Image 
  Stage two was the collection and retroactive publishing of 
Kim Chong-il's past writings. This is more closely related to 
the construction of the Kim Chong-il-succussion system. Of the 
total of over 400 writings by Kim Chong-il, the entire texts of 
30-some works were contained in the DPRK Yearbook 
and NODONG SINMUN in the year of publication, so there is no 
question of their veracity. This is not even 10 percent of the 
total. That is, the remaining 90 percent of his writings can be 
seen as a retroactive publication of past works. This was to 
create Kim Chong-il's talent as a successor. Retroactive 
publishing was probably more important than anything else for 
highlighting his talent as a thinker. 
  The publishing generally took place between 1985 and 1987. 
Published first was Kim Chong-il's college-graduation thesis, 
The Position and Role of the Military in the Construction 
of Socialism, from March 18, 1964. Then economics-related 
works were published: Let Us Strongly Carry Out the Three 
Revolutions, Causing a New Upsurge in Production (July 1, 
1975), Let Us Strengthen Party Leadership of the Rural 
Economy, Causing a New Upsurge in this Year's Agricultural 
Production (February 6, 1976), On Further Developing 
Science and Technology (August 3, 1985), and On 
Observing Revolutionary Discipline within the Party and Further 
Strengthening Party Leadership of Socialist Economic 
Construction (July 13, 1978). These works, together with 
On Further Improving the People's Lives, are 
considered important writings of Kim Chong-il dealing with the 
economic sector. 
  The reason economics-related works were published in a 
concentrated manner at this time was to create his image as an 
economic-policy theorist and secure the legitimacy of his 
regime. This was to be done by supporting the policy to improve 
the people's standard of living through a revolution in light 
industry he advocated beginning in 1984. In June 1985, the "June 
1985 Machine Tool Multiplying Movement" was carried out. In 
early 1986, in connection with improvement of the people's 
standard of living, a blueprint was presented for pursuing the 
construction of Kwangbok-kori. The frequency of Kim Chong-il's 
working-level guidance increased in connection with these 
large-scale, economic-construction projects. Accordingly, it 
appears that the collection of his economics-related works took 
on important meaning. 
  Meanwhile, at this time an attempt was made to establish his 
image as a leader by collecting and publishing On Several 
Problems in Developing Cinematic Art (March 1, 1978), 
To Further Develop Chuche Cultural Art (March 31, 
1981), etc., works in the sociocultural field. A representative 
work on his literary theory, the entire text of Cinematic 
Art Theory was made public in For the Completion of 
the Chuche Revolutionary Great Task Volume II, and 
translated and published in various languages. Thus, his image 
as a "genius of literary art" was brought into relief. Also, 
publishing a pamphlet entitled Gifted One of Ideological 
Theory, the Korean Workers Party Publishers propagandized 
on his college writings and effectively used them in creating 
the myth of Kim Chong-il's genius. 
  As background to the full-scale retroactive publishing in 
1985, we can point to China's fulfillment of its promise of 
support for the Kim Chong-il system through his visit to China 
in June 1983, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu 
Yao-bang's visit to NK in May 1984, and Kim Il-song's visit to 
China in November 1984, and that it was influenced by the 
positive discussion of Kim Chong-il's succession during Kim 
Il-song's six-week tour of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 
during May and June, 1984. Not only this, but internally it 
appears to have started in the designs of Kang Song-san, elected 
prime minister in the third session of the Seventh Supreme 
Peoples Assembly in 1984, and others of the reformist forces to 
expand their own power by using the glory of Kim Chong-il in the 
course of actively pursuing Kim Chong-il's economic policies. 
<H5>  C. Stage Three: Systematization of Publishing and </H5>
Preparation for the Succession 
  After the succession issue concerning Kim Chong-il was 
mentioned in Kim Il-song's official statement in May 1986, NK 
changed direction to publishing writings for the succession. In 
preparation for the succession, NK entered a new phase by 
conducting a publishing project for transferring the charisma of 
Kim Il-song to Kim Chong-il and for establishing the legitimacy 
of the Kim Chong-il regime. During the eight months from late 
September 1988 through early May 1989 as many as 13 Kim Chong-il 
writings were made public as preparation for this succession. 
  First of all, NK started supplementing the area of the Kim 
Chong-il's leadership succession process in which he was the 
weakest: unification. He was made the center of lively activity 
in that area. As of yet, no independent Kim Chong-il works on 
unification have been published. However, NK started inserting 
sections on North-South unification in the last part of 
documents, beginning with the October 1988 The Present 
Time and the Duty of Youth and An Answer to the 
Question Posed by the Cuban newspaper GRANMA's Chairman in 
October 1989. 
  NK is also highlighting Kim Chong-il's great influence on 
unification. Not only was it made official that he is playing a 
leading role in unification with his 1988 presentation of the 
so-called "Four Principles Guaranteeing Peace": orientation 
toward unification, withdrawal of U.S. forces, North-South arms 
reduction, and negotiation between the parties, but it gives Kim 
Chong-il all the credit for sending relief goods for 
flood-disaster victims in September 1984 and the mutual exchange 
of art teams and hometown-visitation groups realized in 
September 1985. 
  Second, he did an overall organization of literary theory. 
Putting together a work on literary theory, Kim Chong-il started 
publishing with a book entitled, On the Literary Art of 
Chuche, and published five books by the end of 1990. 
[passage omitted] Apparently, writings on this field were 
systematized first, out of consideration for the fact that Kim 
Chong-il's talent as a thinker begins in literary theory and 
that even at present he is active as the leader of the literary 
field. 
  Third, NK commenced full-scale systematization of Kim 
Chong-il's works by publishing on February 14, 1992 for the 
first time in a complete-works format, Kim Chong-il 
Selected Works Volume I, in commemoration for his 50th 
birthday. [passage omitted] These writings were praised in the 
extreme by NODONG SINMUN, which called them a strong guide to be 
held firmly in the construction of Socialism and Communism, an 
encyclopedia revealing the way by which the achievements of 
socialism can be defended and advanced through the realization 
Chuche Thought. 
  Also, in the course stage-three publication for the 
succession, NK made a first attempt at dispersing the focus of 
praise concentrated on Kim Il-song. That is, by symbolizing Kim 
Il-song as a figure of the Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Struggle 
and highlighting Kim Chong-il as a capable leader of the present 
time, NK wanted him to inherit the leader's authority, 
monopolized by Kim Il-song during the construction of socialism 
in NK after liberation from Japan. Beginning in late 1987, NK 
had emphasized the history of the anti-Japanese struggle of Kim 
Il-song, through such things as the discovery of the so-called 
"Slogan Tree." 
  The History of the Korean Workers Party, published 
in 1991, can be understood in the same context. Centered on Kim 
Il-song, The History of the Korean Workers Party 
(1979 Edition) was suddenly revised. With the exception of those 
portions related to the Anti-Japanese Revolutionary Struggle, 
most mentions of Kim Il-song were replaced with Kim Chong-il. 
  In particular, NK in 1988 produced and showed the 
documentary 
film, 1974, The Year of the Great Turning Point, in 
which Kim Chong-il was depicted as if having already been made 
successor in 1974. This has led to the idolization of Kim 
Chong-il by creating symbols, such as the cultivation and 
propagation of the Kimjongillia [a flower named after Kim 
Chongil], Chong-il Pong (November 15, 1988), Hyangdo Pong 
(January 1991), and Mansu Mugangsu (February 9, 1991). Also, the 
fact that since 1987 the DPRK Yearbook has not been 
using his previous titles, "Leader," and, "Secretary," can be 
seen as preparation for the use of the title, "The Leader." 
<H8>  3. Conclusion </H8>
  The publication of his works has functioned as an 
indispensable element of the construction process of his 
succession. Through the third stage of publishing, the 
evaluation of his past activities and his image as a leader were 
reformed: his college years were mysticized, the successor issue 
was resolved early (in 1974), and his talent as a thinker and 
his abilities as a leader were demonstrated. 
  We cannot overlook the propaganda activity contributed by 
overseas networks, such as the Chochongnyon [NK-sponsored union 
of Koreans living in Japan] and the African Chuche Thought 
Research Center, in the construction of Kim Chong-il's image. To 
put it another way, his being the heir and the leadership 
succession were brought up more directly through overseas 
organizations. By reporting this in domestic newspapers and 
broadcasts, NK built the people's image of Kim Chong-il. Also, 
titling his works using popular slogans appears to have greatly 
contributed to the elevation of his popular appeal within NK and 
the expansion of his influence. 
  Viewed overall, his writings have not yet been developed 
comprehensively into a single work encompassing politics, 
economics, diplomacy, and unification, as is the case with Kim 
Il-song's writings. Concerning diplomatic and unification issues 
in particular, Kim Chong-il's writings are of little importance. 
  Most teachings being carried out in NK's economic and 
literary fields are based on the writings of Kim Chong-il. In 
economics, in connection with the recent construction of 
Tongil-kori and the pursuit of a revolution in light industry, 
his On Further Improving the People's Lives is 
frequently quoted as a message from the ruler. Because they have 
systematized all the fields of cinema, music, dance, art, 
architecture, and literature, Kim Chong-il's writings are quoted 
as teachings concerning literary activities too. Since Kim 
Il-song's writings on Chuche Thought and the party 
organizational system, are indispensable for Kim Chong-il's 
succession, the frequency of quotations from Kim Chong-il's 
writings on these areas too is gradually increasing. 
  In connection with the establishment of Kim Chong-il's 
image, 
the question of how to establish a relationship between Kim 
Chong-il's and Kim Il-song's writings will become important. NK 
will have to increase quotation of Kim Chong-il's writings in 
the mass media, etc., to establish his image and build his power 
base. Because of this, there is the possibility that conflict 
will occur with the writings of Kim Il-song over the quotation 
issue. Such problems in the establishment of a relationship 
between them will have to be resolved by classifying the two 
series of writings by time period. Kim Il-song's writings will 
be limited to the period before the advent of Kim Chong-il. Kim 
Chong-il's writings will be used for the period after he came on 
the stage. 
  Since it is asserted that Kim Chong-il was already the 
successor in 1974, it is predicted that quotation of his 
writings published after 1974 will increase. For the present, 
however, since there are no Kim Chong-il writings before 1960, 
for this time at least, NK will have no choice but to depend on 
the writings of Kim Il-song. Thus, from a long-term standpoint, 
NK will have to unify the quotation issue by classifying the 
works of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il using 1960 or 1974 as a 
standard.

  [Text] An international monetary source on 12 May disclosed 
that the financial and monetary authorities of Japan, the United 
States, and European nations are basing their actions in 
coordinating policies on interest rates and intervention in 
currency markets on a secret agreement made at a meeting of 
finance ministers and presidents of central banks of the seven 
industrialized nations (G-7) on 24 April. The source said that 
the G-7 nations, with the strong U.S. request in mind, agreed 
that to prevent confusion in the world monetary and securities 
markets caused by a possible slump in the dollar, it is 
necessary to keep the dollar's international value from sliding. 
It is unprecedented in recent years for the G-7 to take 
coordinated action on currency markets and interest rates, and 
in the meeting, the G-7 nations confirmed their intention to 
tighten their unity to promote the stabilization and growth of 
the world economy. 
  Concerning currency markets, they agreed to intermittently 
intervene in currency markets to buy the dollar and sell the yen 
so that the dollar's exchange rate against the yen will not 
break 100 yen. On interest rates, the G-7 agreed that European 
nations--including Germany, which is required to lower interest 
rates--will cut interest rates; that Japan, whose official 
discount rate is the lowest it has ever been, will induce 
financial organs to lower short-term interest rates; and that 
the United States will allay concerns about possible inflation 
by inducing lower interest rates and cutting the discount rate 
and apply the breaks to an upward tendency in long-tern interest 
rates. 
  In this way, the current monetary policies of Japan, the 
United States, and European nations reflect the agreement 
explained above, and there is a growing view that the G-7 states 
have tided over the dollar crisis for the time being. 
  On 24 April, a chairman's statement was issued, although it 
was not issued at the past two meetings of G-7 finance 
ministers. The source said that the release of the statement 
reflects the G-7's positions. 
  At the G-7 meeting of finance ministers in April, 
discussions 
focused on the fact that the exchange rate of the dollar is 
falling not only against the yen but also against European 
currencies such as the German mark. 
  The source said that at the meeting, finance ministers and 
presidents of central banks expressed strong concern about the 
downward trend of the dollar's exchange rate because there is a 
possibility that if this trend should develop into a slump in 
the value of the dollar, this will lead to a worldwide drop in 
stock prices, thus having a harmful impact on the overall world 
economy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] A climate has been created for resuming the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain stalled. On 
12 May, Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, met separately with 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] Minister Eijiro Hata. "During his meeting with 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa, the U.S. ambassador took a flexible 
attitude toward resuming the stalled framework talks by putting 
forth no conditions for their resumption" (says a U.S. 
Government source). Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is eager to 
resume the stalled framework talks and pave the way for Japan 
and the United States to reach a set of agreements at the talks 
prior to the Naples summit scheduled for July. However, "It is 
impermissible to break off the framework talks again" (according 
to a senior MITI official), and Japan and the United States are 
expected to continue to negotiate the resumption of the stalled 
framework talks through informal behind-the-scenes contacts. 
The full-fledged resumption of the stalled framework talks, 
however, hinges on whether or not the two countries will reach 
an agreement on the interpretation of the objective criteria and 
whether or not Japan will be able to put forth concrete plans 
for income tax reductions and a macroeconomic policy. 
  During past Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United 
States asked Japan to implement macroeconomic measures to expand 
Japan's domestic demand and reduce Japan's current account 
surplus, continue income tax reductions, and establish an 
"objective criteria" under which numerical targets are set for 
the three priority sectors of the government's procurement 
(telecommunications and medical equipment), automobile and auto 
parts, and insurance. In response, Japan reacted against the 
U.S. proposal for establishing the objective criteria that 
premises numerical targets, breaking off the framework talks. 
  Since the beginning of this month, however, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor has repeatedly stated: "The United 
States is not seeking any numerical market share." During a 
telephone conversation with Prime Minister Hata on the evening 
of 9 May, President Clinton stressed the need to resume the 
stalled framework talks at an earlier date. According to the 
same U.S. Government source, during a separate meeting with 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa and MITI Minister Hata, U.S. 
Ambassador Mondale stated: "It is good even if the objective 
criteria to be applied to the three priority sectors is not all 
the same." In this way, the U.S. ambassador's statement can be 
taken as the readiness on the part of the United States to make 
concessions to what Japan has advocated. 
  Both Japan and the United States are said to have no 
disagreement on the continued income tax cuts, but it still 
remains unclear whether or not the government will set forth 
clear plans for the continued income tax cuts by the end of June 
because of a problem with financial resources. 
  The same senior MITI official warily says: "We do not expect 
the United States to drop its proposal for the objective 
criteria so easily."

  [Text] Nissan Motor Company will lower the export price 
for "Maxima," the passenger car to be sold in the United States 
beginning on 13 May, by about 6 percent for its lowest-priced 
model. The reduction has been done by changing components. 
  As a result of the sharp appreciation of the yen in the past 
one to two years, Japanese companies have been forced to lower 
their selling local prices, and have been losing grounds to the 
U.S.-made cars. The new pricing strategy of Nissan this time 
means it is giving priority to winning "price competitiveness" 
even in the U.S. market, and this is likely to impact on other 
Japanese manufacturers too. 
  The new model of Maxima will be equipped with a remodeled 
3,000-cc engine. While safety features of the car have been 
improved by putting airbags on both driver's and front 
passenger's seats as standard equipment, remote-controlled 
doorlocks and aluminum wheels have become optional, becoming 
available at real cost prices if wanted by buyers. Additional 
cost savings have been done by making some parts interchangeable 
and adopting new technologies. 
  The price for the lowest-priced automatic base-model car is 
$20,999, which is about $1,400 (6.4 percent) less than the 
current model. A manually driven base model, priced under 
$20,000, has become available as well. 
  Nissan's action this time is aimed at impressing the 
would-be 
buyers with the low price of the car by simplifying some of the 
components. But it can be interpreted also as a change in the 
Japanese car manufacturer's policy -- going back from making 
larger and deluxe cars to making low-priced cars.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Michio Sakamura] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May -- It has been learned that the 
Taiwan Government has proposed to the Japanese Government that 
it put into effect voluntary export restraint (VER) for Taiwan 
in return for Taiwan's liberalization of automobile imports from 
Japan. In a bid to join the General Agreement of Tariff and 
Trade [GATT], Taiwan has held trade talks with its trading 
partners to discuss reducing its import ban items, and it is the 
first time that Taiwan has put forth a concrete step to relax 
import regulations. The Japanese Government, however, is 
reacting against the Taiwan offer, claiming that "the VER runs 
counter to the basic principle of GATT" (according to the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry). Hence, Japan and 
Taiwan are likely to face rough sailing in their trade talks. 
  At present, Taiwan allows only the import of Japanese-built 
automobiles with more than 3,000-cc engine displacement which 
are not built in that country. For this reason, Japanese 
automakers have formed joint ventures with Taiwan automakers for 
local production of automobiles or exported their automobiles 
built at their plants in the United States to Taiwan. In Taiwan, 
the demand for Japanese-built cars has been growing and it is 
highly possible that Taiwan's full liberalization of automobile 
imports from Japan will deal a blow to the Taiwan automobile 
industry. For this reason, the Taiwan Government intends to 
protect the domestic automobile industry by asking the Japanese 
Government to adopt the VER which sets the total number of 
Japanese-built automobiles to be exported to Taiwan. 
  The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs held a meeting with 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo in 
late April at which the Taiwan side expressed a willingness to 
allow Japanese automakers to make phased exports of small 
Japanese-built automobiles with about 2,000-cc engine 
displacement to Taiwan. The Taiwan side, however, proposed that 
Japan apply the same VER and the same import monitoring system 
to Taiwan as it does to the United States and the EU in return 
for the trade concession. As measures for the phased exports of 
small Japanese-built automobiles, the Taiwan side proposed that 
the rate of tariffs for them be set in two categories and a 
"tariff quota formula" that restricts the import of low-tariff 
Japanese-built automobiles be introduced. 
  The Japanese Government takes the position that the VER is 
incompatible with the objective of GATT, but it plans to decide 
on its stand while examining the "tariff quota formula." 
  In an attempt to join GATT, Taiwan has held trade talks with 
its trading partners to discuss ways to open its market. It is 
now examining the possibility of freeing Japanese firms from the 
ban on their participation in bidding for construction projects 
for nuclear power plants and steel plants.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] said on 13 May it plans to drastically revise postwar 
Japan's trade policy, now that the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) is due to set sail in January 1995. The ministry will do 
self-criticism on the past practice of addressing issues as they 
occur instantaneously, using managed trade techniques and 
holding bilateral talks--mostly with the United States. It will 
come up with a policy that gives weight to a free trade system 
and emphasis to multinational talks. 
  Later this month, a WTO Division (headed by Professor Mitsuo 
Matsushita of Seikei University) will be set up under the 
Industrial Structure Council which is an advisory panel to the 
MITI minister. Guidelines for new policy will be prepared by 
next spring and Japan's change of its trade policy will be 
formally reported to all countries in the first miniterial 
meeting of the WTO. 
  The ministry plans to revise its policy because the scope of 
the WTO operations -- being different from that of the GATT of 
the past -- not only applies to trade of commodities, but also 
extends to international economic rules, such as services, 
intellectural property rights, and trade-related investments. 
The WTO also bans gray measures like those seen in 
self-controls on export. 
  Rules on the arbitration of disputes change from the current 
consensus system of requiring unanimous approval by the 
Arbitration Board to a negative consensus system wherein a 
judgment cannot be overturned unless everyone on the board votes 
for disagreement. As such, it has become easy for a judgment by 
the Grievance Panel to be upheld. All this has prompted the 
ministry to decide toward making the revision. 
  The ministry now is doing self-criticism, admitting the 
practices it has indulged in--of taking actions instantaneously 
when pressed by countries like the United States in trade 
talks--are "things that lead to managed trade." The ministry 
will clearly state in its policy that Japan will abide by the 
WTO rules and will file complaints with the WTO even against the 
United States when infractions of the rules occur. 
  Also regarding the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement which 
is due to expire in the summer of 1996, Japan will negotiate 
with the United States toward removing the controversial part 
which can be interpreted as having made a commitment on market 
shares of the foreign-made semiconductors. 
  In the new policy, the subjects to be discussed in the WTO 
in 
the future--such as the impact of labor, environment, 
competitive policy, and investments on trade issues--will be 
taken up. It will explain discussions need to take into account 
the concerns of Asian nations lest these matters be linked to 
protectionism. The abolition of export cartels in principle and 
the problem of intra-keiretsu dealings in trade will be also 
dealt with.

  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, at a news 
conference on the morning of 12 May, said: "The deregulation 
process is coming to a crucial point now. But if we leave the 
matter to bureaucrats, there is no question they will drag their 
feet. Political leadership on it is now being asked. All 
ministers must make all the efforts possible to have 
deregulation achieved even if it means risking their political 
career." He made this remark in comment on the public 
discontent about deregulation that it is making hardly any 
progress in the face of bureaucratic resistance. 
  Degulation makes up a major part of the package of measures 
for opening up Japan's market as the demand of the United States 
and other nations. The government wants to work out plans for 
it by the end of June, and Kumagai's comment is intended to 
assert government's determination to strongly push for 
deregulation under political leadership. 
  Before this news conference, Kumagai had met with Koshiro 
Ishida, head of the Management and Coordination Agency, and 
agreed to call an informal meeting of ministers concerned to 
discuss the deregulation question soon. Ishida proposed the 
meeting, saying: "Deregulation is a key point in economic 
reform. Let us infuse more enthusiasim into the ministers to 
get this done by all means."

  [Text] The Panel on Import Promotion, Market Access 
Improvement, and Distribution under the Administrative Reform 
Promotion Headquarters held a meeting at the Prime Minister's 
Official Residence on the morning of 12 May to discuss ways to 
relax regulations in the distribution field. Isao Nakauchi, 
chairman of Daiei, other businessmen, and scholars, who attended 
the meeting as members of the panel, criticized government 
ministries and agencies for balking at relaxing bureaucratic 
regulations. 
  The panel held the meeting for the first time since the Hata 
cabinet was inaugurated. Speaking to members of the panel, Prime 
Minister Hata stated, "It is the mission of my cabinet to relax 
the bureaucratic regulations effectively." After the prime 
minister left the meeting room, bureau chiefs from ministries 
and agencies concerned briefed members of the panel on their 
respective plans for deregulation in the fields of opening of 
outlets by large-scale department stores, the sales of 
second-hand goods, and the establishment of gas stations. 
  In their briefing, all bureau chiefs indicated the 
difficulty 
in promoting deregulation. In response, one member after another 
of the panel voiced discontent with the briefing, saying: "We 
want to hear from you about how your ministries and agencies 
plan to vigorously relax the regulations. We believe that it is 
time for ministries and agencies concerned to pool their wisdom 
and announce plans for fruitful deregulation." 
  The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters will 
include 
deregulatory steps in a package of external economic measures 
that the government will map out at the end of June. The 
headquarters will use the discussion at the panel only as 
reference material. The business community is voicing discontent 
with the government, saying, "If the work of relaxing the 
bureaucratic regulations is left in the hands of bureaucrats, 
bold measures for their relaxation cannot be expected."

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] decided on 11 May to abolish the "three export-related 
laws," including the Export Inspection Law, which were enacted 
during Japan's period of rapid economic growth to promote 
exports. 
  Japanese products have already attained a high quality 
level, 
and Japan is now being asked to expand imports because of its 
huge trade surplus. The three laws are thought to have outlived 
their usefulness. This measure is also considered part of the 
government's deregulation efforts. 
  Of the three laws, the Export Inspection Law and Export 
Products Design Law will be abrogated in 1997, while the law on 
standardized labeling for export products of small businesses is 
expected to be abolished before the end of 1994. 
  The Export Inspection Law requires quality inspection for 
certain products specified under the law. Products failing to 
pass this inspection cannot be exported. In the 1960's, the 
inspection list included as many as 500 items, although at 
present, the list has been shortened to 50 commodities, such as 
eyeglasses and silk products. 
  The Export Products Design Law is aimed at preventing 
imitation of designs to promote the export of high quality 
products. Only seven items, including fountain pens and 
furniture, come under the jurisdiction of this law.

  [Text] While the ruling and opposition parties are 
simultaneously urging the need for an "early passage" of the 
fiscal 1994 budget bill, various ministries and agencies in 
Kasumigaseki [where judicial and administrative organizations 
are concentrated] are worried that their appeal may end in mere 
gesture. Since the resumption of budget deliberations at the 
House of Representatives' Budget Committee will be delayed until 
23 May, it is uncertain whether Diet will pass the budget bill 
by the end of the current Diet session on 29 June, when a 
supplement to the current stop-gap budget -- which will be 
approved soon -- expires. Moreover, with an eye on the 
political situation, the ruling parties are ready to take a 
stance of not speeding up the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget 
until they submit a bill for redistricting single-seat 
constituencies to the Diet. There is a growing view that "the 
outlook for the redistricting bill will decide all the matters, 
including the timing of approving the budget" (as stated by the 
Ministry of Finance [MOF]). 
  In an effort to overcome the awkward situation of the 
minority ruling parties, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has at last 
begun calling on both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] after the Golden Week 
holidays to hold a summit meeting on future management of 
policies. However, the prospects for the budget passage are 
still uncertain. Showing its displeasure, the MOF said: "We 
had no choice but to work out a supplement to the provisional 
budget to cover the long period before the end of the current 
Diet session." 
  While the ruling parties have maintained that top priority 
should be placed on the budget passage, both the LDP and SDPJ 
have taken an attitude of cooperating with them for the time 
being. However, after the budget passage, the two parties 
intend to soon move to overthrow the Hata administration through 
such measures as submitting a no-confidence motion in the 
cabinet. 
  On the other hand, the idea of approving the redistricting 
bill at the Diet immediately and securing a free hand in 
dissolving the House of Representatives has cropped up among the 
ruling parties. However, since the panel has just begun studying 
details of redistricting single-seat constituencies, it is 
impossible to submit the bill to the Diet immediately. If the 
fiscal 1994 budget passes the Diet too quickly, the opposition 
parties will be given a chance to submit a no-confidence motion 
at any time. 
  For this reason, it is widely speculated in Kasumigaseki 
that 
"because it is wiser for the ruling parties to continue budget 
deliberations until the redistricting bill is submitted to the 
Diet, they may take such a move" (according to an MOF official). 
The ruling parties themselves will, so to speak, hold the 
budget bill as a "hostage." 
  Kasumigaseki officials are critical of both the LDP and SDPJ 
as well, saying: "Their true intention is that they do not want 
to speed up budget deliberations." They say coolly: "If they 
intend to overthrow the cabinet, they should immediately submit 
a no-confidence motion in the cabinet after approving the budget 
bill. Their unwillingness to do so is evidence of their lack of 
administrative strategies after they overthrow the cabinet." 
  There is a possibility that the ruling and opposition 
parties' justification that "the political situation should not 
be confused during deliberations on the budget" may result in a 
delay in approving the budget. Irritation is increasing at 
ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa by </F>
unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Could you comment on the issue of 
the suspected nuclear weapons development program by the DPRK? 
  [Kakizawa] I welcome North Korea's positive stance toward 
accepting full nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). But in the past, the DPRK sometimes took 
half a step backward after taking a step forward. So, we will 
watch the development of this issue while keeping in contact 
with South Korea and the United States. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What should Japan do if the United States 
independently begins sanctions against the North? 
  [Kakizawa] It is too early to discuss what Japan should do 
at a time when the United Nations has not yet decided on its 
policy toward Pyongyang. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You have repeatedly said that a study should 
be made about enacting legislation to cope with an emergency 
situation. Does this view remain unchanged? 
  [Kakizawa] Since I assumed the foreign ministerial post, I 
have repeatedly expressed the hope that an emergency situation 
will be averted. But when I was asked what Japan should do in 
an emergency, I said Japan had to cooperate with the United 
Nations within the scope of the Constitution. I was also asked 
many times whether it is necessary to enact new legislation. In 
reply, I said should an emergency occur, the government would 
have to consider taking necessary measures. But I added that it 
was not good to discuss, based on supposition, whether new 
legislation is necessary, or whether the government can deal 
with an emergency with administrative measures. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What does "cooperation within the scope of 
the Constitution" mean? 
  [Kakizawa] This is related to the interpretation of Article 
9 of the Constitution. I have proposed that the people and 
political parties should discuss what comes within the scope of 
the Constitution without a preconceived notion on the 
conventional interpretation of the article. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You have also noted the need to reexamine 
the right to collective defense. 
  [Kakizawa] I merely proposed to have discussions about the 
right. To avoid a hawkish image which could develop depending 
on the developments of the DPRK nuclear issue and due to former 
Justice Minister Nagano's recent remarks on the Pacific war, the 
Hata cabinet decided to unify cabinet ministers' views. As a 
result, it has adopted a unified, conventional position that 
Japan has the right to collective defense as an independent 
country but Article 9 limits the use of this right.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Criticism Against Leadership Pours </F>
Out in the Democratic Socialist Party Over `Kaishin' Issue"] 
  [Text] Within the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] which 
was a party to the forming of "Kaishin," a new parliamentary 
group of the ruling coalition parties in the House of 
Representatives, stinging criticism is now being poured out 
against its leadership. Considered as having blackmailed the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and thus as having 
driven it out of the coalition, the party is now under heavy 
attack from its two supporting labor unions -- the Japanese 
Private Sector Trade Union Confederation [Rengo] and the Yuai 
Council. Among party members there is now a growing sense of 
crisis that if a next general election is held under the current 
medium electoral district system, "the DSP will meet a 
catastrophe." It is becoming increasingly possible that the DSP 
party convention in June will become an arena where the party 
members go all-out demanding that Chairman Keigo Ouchi and 
Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa take responsibility. 
  "How many party members can be elected without support from 
labor unions if the next election is held under the current 
medium electoral district system?" This question was asked at 
an emergency general meeting of DSP Dietmen held on 28 April 
when the Hata administration was inaugurated. A majority of 
party members argued, "Taking responsibility for causing the 
SPDJ to withdraw from the coalition, Chairman Keigo Ouchi and 
other party leaders should not take posts in the new cabinet." 
Party Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, put on the defensive, 
hurriedly called Ouchi to the meeting. The meeting was 
adjourned eventually after the matter was "left to the 
leadership" to decide. But the prevailing air is that this time 
things will not settle down easily by "letting the air out" as 
in the past. 
  The DSP--which sent Ouchi (as the health and welfare 
minister) and Atushi Kanda (as director general of the Defense 
Agency) into the cabinet--initially sought to obtain three posts 
by also sending party Policy Board Chairman Kansei Nakano into 
the cabinet. A DSP source said that Ouchi had expected to land a 
post of the foreign minister or deputy prime minister in 
recognition of his "special constributions." 
  A goal of the new floor group is said to be "to give strong 
support to the Hata administration" (according to Yonezawa). 
However, a ranking DSP official says, this in fact means "to 
take away the posts of the chairman of the [house] Budget 
Committee and the head of ruling parties' Tax System Reform 
Council from the SDPJ and to give them to people from the 
largest organization of the ruling parties. There was also the 
expectation that "if the new floor group is formed, the SDPJ 
will lose one ministerial post and the DSP will get it." In 
addition, Ouchi had a design of solidifying his base within his 
own party. 
  Neither Ouchi nor Yonezawa had informed Rengo Chairman Akira 
Yamagishi and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo of this plan 
for the new floor group in advance because they were scared lest 
the plan, if exposed, should be crushed. As such, even the DSP 
members, who originally supported the plan, have misgivings 
about this "foul play" done on the SDPJ. A DSP Dietman of the 
House of Councilors said: "Once a politician betrays people, he 
is done with. The SDPJ might have agreed with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] on policy matters, but the former was an 
existence different from the latter in that sense." 
  At the general meeting, the leadership persuaded members by 
saying: "To take responsibility, we should support the 
administration from within the cabinet. It is not a time for us 
to run away from problems." But many DSP members said: "The 
chairman and the secretary general used to have their way in 
controlling the party, but after 8 April when former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation, discontent 
erupted and the leadership no longer has power to control it." 
No doubt, the party leadership will have a tough time once the 
DSP Dietmen return from visits to their home towns during the 
national holidays [April 29-5 May].

  [Text] Voices demanding dissolution of the lower house 
floor group "Kaishin"--creation of which caused the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to bolt the coalition--are now 
growing in the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] in the ruling camp. The two parties are 
expected to hold talks to discuss the issue of "Kaishin" early 
next week. The prevailing view is that even when the floor 
group is disbanded, "the SDPJ will not return to the coalition" 
(as an SDPJ staff official predicted). It appears that the two 
parties want to "at least avoid the situation of fataly damaging 
relations with the SPDJ" in light of the forthcoming 
possibilities of the cabinet resigning en masse and the House of 
Representatives dissolving for a general election. 
  Within the JNP, it is said that "nearly 90 percent of the 
party members oppose keeping the `Kaishin' group intact" 
(according to a JNP Dietman). At a standing committee meeting 
of all party Dietmen on 11 May, voices of criticism were poured 
on former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his leadership 
for causing the SDPJ to bolt the coalition over the Kaishin 
issue. The issue of criticism was settled on 12 May only after 
Banri Kaieda, chairman of the public relations committee, 
proposed that the party "make efforts toward retracting the 
`Kaishin' concept in cooperation with the DSP," and the members 
accepted the proposal. 
  In the party also are unceasing voices calling for Hosokawa 
to step down from the post as the party representative. The 
retraction of the "Kaishin" concept is, in large measure, aimed 
at preventing the party from breaking up. 
  The DSP held its meeting of all party Dietmen of both houses 
at its headquarters on the evening of 13 May. Nearly all the 
members agreed that the "Kaishin" issue became the cause for the 
SDPJ to bolt the coalition, and that "this means the DSP should 
take responsibility for the grave consequence." After the 
meeting, Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa told reporters the 
DSP wants to take concerted action with the JNP on this issue, 
and added: "If disbanding of `Kaishin' could solidify the base 
of the Hata administration, we must take this into our 
consideration." 
  Meanwhile, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is negative about 
the immediate retraction of the concept because it believes "the 
disbanding of `Kaishin' should be done as a last resort only" 
(according to a Shinseito official). Shinseito adviser Tatsuo 
Ozawa, who was named secretary general of the "Kaishin" floor 
group, met with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on 12 May. 
Shinseito is now seeking ways to break the current deadlock. 
But with the likelihood of the SDPJ returning to the coalition 
being slim, the party appears to be more interested in breaking 
up the SDPJ-Liberal Democratic Party alliance relationship now.

  [Text] The Japan New Party [JNP], at its standing 
committee meeting on 11 May, discussed the issue of whether 
Morihiro Hosokawa (former prime minister), whose term as party 
head will expire soon, should stay in "the leader's post." Most 
of those at the meeting favored his reappointment although some 
opposed it. Thus, the leadership now plans to request Hosokawa 
to stay as party leader, and then make an official decision at a 
national meeting of party representatives in early June. 
  There still remain differences of view on the issue within 
the party, however. While there is a group saying, "We will act 
with Mr. Hosokawa to the end," there is also a group that is 
critical of Hosokawa for his role in forming the floor group 
"Kaishin." Thus, it is possible that the question of Hosokawa 
needing to quit may come up again in the future. 
  The meeting on the morning of 11 May of the 23-member 
standing committee was called to discuss the issue of who should 
be named to head the party. Most of the committee members 
shared the opinion: "If he resigns, the JNP will not be able to 
go on its own." 
  However, when another meeting was held with all party Diet 
members attending later in the afternoon, voices of strong 
discontent erupted with some members saying: "Our mission is to 
achieve political reform, and Mr. Hosokawa betrayed it."

<F P=106> [Interview with Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of </F>
Shinseito, by an unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
which supports its leader Tsutomu Hata who has become the prime 
minister, made a severe start, didn't it? 
  [Watanabe] Since we are sailing in the all-time furious 
storm, nothing is harder than the current situation. But the 
weather clears up after a storm. If Mr. Hata does his job by 
making good use of his characteristics of frankness, the people 
will understand him. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some say the way in which the group 
"Kaishin" was formed was coercive. 
  [Watanabe] Shinseito's original view was that the ruling 
coalition parties should get united before the upper house 
election set for next year. We were thinking of the following 
procedure: at first, parties which have similar backgrounds, 
ideas, and policies come together, and then the realists of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] join the force. A hitch 
occurred when we did things very quickly. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Party members also expressed criticism. 
  [Watanabe] Some members argue that there are no internal 
procedures in the party. Secretary General Ozawa briefed on the 
proceedings at a joint meeting of the standing secretaries 
council and the secretaries council, and they unanimously 
approved the idea about forming "Kaishin." Probably, some of 
those who are not party executives were not informed of it. 
However, we did not avoid democratic process, but we put things 
through based on decisions made at party bodies. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Shinseito's scenario for 
realignment of the political world has changed now that the 
coalition has become a minority? 
  [Watanabe] We believe the trend will move toward the 
political system based on two major parties. However, as Mr. 
Takemura (Sakigake [Harbinger] representative Masayoshi 
Takemura) and others mentioned the force to be comprised of the 
"Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP], and liberals," now there is a move toward 
building the tripolar structure. Under the situation, there had 
been differences of opinion among the ruling coalition parties. 
Although I do not know whether this is a temporary trend, I am 
sure that the tripolar structure has become clear with the 
SDPJ's secession from the coalition. It is not easy to clearly 
say whether the current political structure will return to the 
bipolar system in preparation for introducing the electoral 
system for the House of Representatives combining single-seat 
constituencies with proportional representation. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration is said to be a 
"short-lived administration." 
  [Watanabe] When we formed the Takeshita cabinet, we thought 
it would continue for at least four years. However, it lasted 
only one and one-half years. The Nakasone cabinet, which was 
said to be a short-lived administration at the beginning, lasted 
for a long time. Taking these cases into consideration, I do not 
care about this matter very much. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is Shinseito's basic strategy in the 
minority administration? 
  [Watanabe] By proposing concrete policies on the tax system, 
diplomacy, and other issues which can be supported by the 
general public, we will make efforts to gain support for the 
Hata cabinet from Diet members who voted for "Tsutomu Hata" in 
the prime ministerial election. That is all about our strategy. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some talk about the possibility of the House 
of Representative being dissolved. What is the outlook? 
  [Watanabe] The dissolution can be considered only when the 
budget bill or other important bills are rejected at the Diet, 
and when a no-confidence motion in the cabinet is approved. 
However, if a no-confidence motion in the cabinet is approved 
without any reason, the cabinet should not resign en masse 
tamely. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Did the resignation of former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano give a blow to your party? 
  [Watanabe] It was really regrettable. Giving consideration 
to the Asian people is Mr. Hata's basic policy. If a person 
whose ideas are totally different from those of the prime 
minister is asked to join the cabinet, he should not accept the 
offer. From the viewpoint of democracy, once a person joins the 
cabinet, he should follow the prime minister's ideas. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito has given a growing impression 
that it is a "hawkish" party. What do you think of it? 
  [Watanabe] In the past, politicians who pushed forward the 
normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China 
were called doves while those who expressed opposition were 
called hawks. We supported normalization when we were members 
of the former Tanaka faction of the LDP. We have the consistent 
belief that we are the doves within the conservative party. I 
deeply regret that people call us the hawks. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any gap between the image and the 
reality? 
  [Watanabe] The image comes from our views on the 
Constitution. We do not say the Constitution should be revised 
soon. However, since the Constitution has provisions for its 
revision, it is inappropriate to think the discussion itself on 
revision of the Constitution leads to being hawks or ignoring 
the Constitution. Discussion on amendment of the Constitution 
should be taboo.

<F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii by an </F>
unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Without the recommendation of the 
electoral redistricting panel on new constituency boundaries for 
the House of Representatives, the government cannot submit 
relevant bills to the Diet. When will the panel give the 
recommendation? 
  [Ishii] The panel is composed of intellectuals. The Home 
Affairs Ministry has no intention of intervening in its 
discussions and urging it to compile the recommendation at an 
early date. We just hope it to compile it as early as possible. 
I expect the panel will make the recommendation at a fairly 
early time. Judging from how political reform bills were 
enacted, I think the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] also will 
not oppose the bills on new constituency boundaries. We will do 
our utmost to have the bills adopted during the current Diet 
session. 
<H5>  Whether Public Notification Period Should Be Set Depends on </H5>
the Situation 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will the prime minister's right to dissolve 
the House of Representatives be restricted until a new electoral 
system is introduced? 
  [Ishii] Legally, the right cannot be restricted. But 
politically speaking, I think it has already been restricted. 
Political reform bills became law after all parties, except the 
Japan Communist Party, gave approval to them. After all, what 
is the purpose of political reform if we do not hold the next 
election under a new system? Those who call for relapsing into 
a state five years ago and holding the election under the 
current 70-year-old, worn-out electoral system are just trying 
to maintain their status as Diet members. They will be 
criticized as being concerned only about own interests. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Even if the bills to redraw constituency 
boundaries pass through the current Diet session, it will still 
be impossible to hold the election under a new system in summer 
because of a public notification period needed to make known to 
the people the new electoral system. 
  [Ishii] The constituency reallocation plan drawn up by the 
former Kaifu cabinet recommends a three-month notification 
period. But the Hata government is to set the duration of the 
period after the bills on new constituency boundaries are 
enacted and enforced. Although some say the government should 
have the notification period, I think the decision should be 
made after examining a future political situation. 
<H5>  There Are Many Severe Penalties </H5>
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How will a new electoral system affect the 
reorganization of political parties? 
  [Ishii] The current multiple-seat constituency system 
established a political structure in which five major political 
forces and five LDP factions were formed. As such, an electoral 
system certainly determines the political structure of a nation. 
Although the new electoral system is combined with proportional 
representation in consideration of small parties, more seats 
should be allocated to single-seat constituencies in the future. 
Various things will happen in the process of forming a new 
political structure, but it is certain the new electoral system 
will lead to a two-party system. If the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan, which seceded from the coalition, continues to go its 
own way, this will help the main opposition LDP return to power. 
Moreover, it will defile the spirit of political reform. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Doesn't the Political Corruption Prevention 
Law still has a loophole? 
  [Ishii] The fact is that measures to prevent only political 
corruption have been implemented in several stages since the 
Miki cabinet. Politicians are now bound by many regulations. 
We have to depend on our party for raising political fund. The 
four political reform bills recently enacted carry stiff 
penalties for violations. One mistake will cost a politician a 
five-year deprivation of civil rights. So, I hope you will not 
underestimate these laws. I also hope the people will 
understand them. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The promotion of decentralization of power 
is also a major task for the Hata cabinet. 
  [Ishii] I would like to be a powerful driving force to 
promote the decentralization and hope to make some progress 
while I am in office. There are many issues local governments 
should deal with from their position of being close to citizens. 
The central government should transfer as many powers as 
possible to them. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Home Affairs Ministry has been calling 
on the Tax Commission to create a regional consumption tax. 
  [Ishii] The creation of a regional consumption tax will form 
a new source of revenue for local governments. Moreover, it 
will respond to an international call for Japan to abolish the 
centralization of administrative power. Under the current tax 
system, taxes are first collected by the central government and 
then distributed to local governments. If this system is 
maintained, the Finance Ministry will continue to take the 
initiative. Without missing a good chance for the tax reform, I 
will tackle this issue as an urgent task. However, whenever 
elections draw near, politicians tend to become reluctant about 
tax reform. I hope the people will support politicians who have 
opinions of their own and carry out their policies in earnest.

<F P=106> [By former Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito] </F>
  [Text] Half a year has passed since I assumed duties as 
minister in charge of transportation administration and I have 
finally acquired a vague glimpse of a portion of my 
responsibilities. As is widely known, the Ministry of Transport 
is the largest licensing agency, handling 1,966 of the 11,000 
licensing functions administered by the government. Recently, 
this licensing authority has suddenly become the target of 
criticism for its abusive nature and, in reality, is the subject 
of a variety of problems. 
  "Conversion to a policy agency" is the earnest desire of the 
Ministry of Transport, but adequate debate has not taken place 
on how to implement such a change. The numerous licensing 
functions symbolize the significance of bureaucratic ties to 
industry and conversion to a policy agency involves the question 
of how to relax direct and specific controls over industry and 
convert to a system of indirect supervision. 
  Today, the Ministry of Transport has arrived at a juncture 
where it must study methods of actively proposing policies and 
regulations from a fresh perspective with a view to promoting 
the internationalization and integration of Japan's 
transportation systems, while nurturing the growth of the 
recreation industry so that it is responsive to the needs of the 
public. However, more than just a few aspects of today's 
transportation administration obstruct the growth of industries 
over which it exercises jurisdiction. The Ministry of Transport 
has no future as long as it remains protective about the 
benefits realized by the ministry in terms of such aspects. Now 
is the time that specific proposals must be developed in terms 
of what is necessary and what is not necessary for the growth of 
traffic and transportation in Japan. 
<H5>  Transportation Administration Reaches Stalemate </H5>
  I believe this particular weakness is common to a varying 
degree among other ministries and agencies, but the foundation 
for today's administration, formed immediately following the end 
of World War II, was designed primarily for addressing domestic 
issues and must be categorized as being weak in handling today's 
international issues. Transportation administration is not 
compatible with today's transportation industry services 
deployed on an international level, because government 
administration was designed to address issues of protection and 
guidance of the transportation industry in the domestic 
environment. And, despite the fact that vertical administrative 
services go beyond the framework of the past, I believe that the 
absence of decisions concerning ministerial and agency handling 
of such vast new areas has caused delays in administrative 
responses to new problems. 
  Now, the question is, what are the basic issues which must 
be 
dealt with in the area of transportation administration? First, 
greater efficiency and economies in Japan's transportation 
industry must be attained by converting the current land, sea 
and air traffic net into a three-way system of cooperative 
relationships. Second, we must take positive measures responsive 
to the issues of providing services on an international scale 
and attain growth in the overall transportation system in Japan 
with airlines playing a key role. And, third, we must evaluate 
the new role to be played by tourism and recreation which serve 
as a basis for bringing genuine affluence into the lifestyles of 
Japan and the Japanese, relax regulations which pose obstacles 
to such change and actively implement partial alliances with 
other interested ministries and agencies and launch new 
administrative services. In this article, I would like to engage 
in a special discussion of the aviation issue. 
<H5>  Construction of Regional Airports Completed </H5>
  The aviation issue also entails international and domestic 
issues. Japan lags in the handling of such issues. Specifically, 
it has failed to fully address the issue of planning for 
international hub airports. 
  Currently, air passengers in Japan total about 135 million a 
year, of which 34.49 million are international passengers. It is 
obvious that domestic passengers are large in number, but the 
growth rate in international passengers is high and 
international routes are expanding annually. 
  Airport administration in Japan in the past was focused 
primarily on construction and maintenance of domestic airports. 
This was because, after all, airplanes provide the best means of 
traveling long distances, and a strong desire was expressed for 
the establishment of airports in each prefecture. Airports are 
essential to isolated islands and remote areas. And, efforts by 
governors and elected politicians have resulted in the 
construction of airports in almost all prefectures. Prefectures 
without airports are currently limited to those surrounding 
major metropolitan areas such as Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma, 
Yamanashi, Shizuoka, Mie, Gifu, Kyoto, and Shiga, because they 
are located near international airports in nearby urban areas. I 
believe we can say that domestic airports have been developed to 
an essential level. 
  Currently, about 500 scheduled overseas flights are flown 
out 
of the 17 international airports located in Japan. There is no 
need to mention that such international flights will increase in 
the future. Of those international flights, 95 overseas cities 
are covered by flights operating in and out of Narita and 107 
overseas cities are covered by flights operating in and out of 
Osaka and Nagoya. Currently, 63 percent of passengers destined 
for overseas flights depart from Narita. 
<H5>  60 Percent of Travelers Fly Via Seoul </H5>
  However, the problem is that connections between Narita and 
Japanese domestic airports are extremely bad. Presently, 
connecting flights to domestic airports out of Narita are 
limited to 12 daily. Because of this factor, many travelers must 
spend two hours lugging their heavy baggage to move to Haneda 
for connecting flights to their domestic destinations. This 
situation has caused about 60 percent of travelers going to 
overseas destinations from western Japan to depart via Seoul. 
This situation, in turn, is a reflection of the fact that, of 
the 17 international airports in Japan, all except Nagasaki have 
scheduled connecting flights with Seoul and such flights now 
total 49. If Seoul is used as a connecting point, transfers are 
simple and enable use of air transportation to overseas areas 
directly from an airport near one's residence. Narita is being 
disregarded by the Japanese public itself. 
  Further, another crisis is approaching in the form of a 
national effort by South Korea to build a huge international hub 
airport on the outskirts of Seoul. 
  The project envisions the construction of a major airport 
with a four-lane, 4,000-meter runway and 2,500-meter auxiliary 
runway to provide for connections between long- and 
short-distance international flights and domestic flights for 
the convenience of travelers, increase the utilization rate of 
aircraft, reduce costs and energy consumption, and contribute to 
improvement of environmental factors, thus enabling South Korea 
to successfully address the issue of modernization of the 
aviation industry. 
  Logically, the international hub airport will be welcomed by 
aviation firms and passengers alike. As already mentioned in 
this article, in actuality, an international aviation network 
has been established with Western Japan via the Seoul airport. 
  International carriers are currently engaged in fierce 
competition. The three Japanese airlines are unprofitable at the 
present time and U.S. and European firms are all facing 
difficulties with only a few exceptions. International airlines 
are desperately undertaking restructurings and reengineerings. 
They are taking rapid action on measures such as reductions in 
international routes, efficient use of aircraft, joint use of 
maintenance facilities, energy conservation, reduction and 
internationalization of flight crews, and curtailment of fringe 
services. 
  Increases in international passengers or increased 
popularity 
of international flights has been accompanied by a logical 
welcoming of lower passenger tariffs. Recently, we have 
witnessed spreading acceptance of the concept that low fares are 
the most valuable service extended to air travelers. 
  A common desire of airlines and international travelers is 
the ability to use "international hub airports." As an example, 
the concept would call for all U.S. airlines destined for Asia 
to concentrate at Seoul and for flights beyond Seoul to be 
handled by connecting Korean Airlines flights to airports in 
other Asian countries. In reverse, the concept would provide for 
concentration of passengers from Asian countries at Seoul, 
movement to a U.S. hub airport and further travel to U.S. 
destinations aboard domestic air carriers. 
  Moreover, this concept is already being launched with the 
participation of Korean Airlines, United Airlines, and Aeroflot. 
The future will probably witness the implementation of a variety 
of programs by international air carriers. Present projections 
indicate that the international hub concept will improve 
aircraft use by 40 percent, enable a significant reduction in 
fares, and improve the financial performance of air carriers. 
  Needless to say, South Korea will control the rights to use 
Seoul Airport and will limit its use by Japanese airlines. That 
will threaten the viability of Japanese airlines and may result 
in the situation where "passenger airlines carrying the `sun' 
symbol will disappear from Japanese skies." 
<H5>  Issue of Grave Concern to Japan's Future </H5>
  There is little political will to build an international hub 
airport in Japan and, if the situation remains unchanged, Japan 
will deprived of a key role in international aviation. Japan 
faces options that will determine whether it can survive in the 
international aviation industry. 
  Japan urgently needs to build an international hub airport 
exceeding the scale of that planned for South Korea. I say 
urgent because Seoul is proceeding with a plan which it intends 
to implement beginning in 1997. And, aside from South Korea, 
Beijing, Hong Kong, and Singapore are building major 
international airports with a view to making them hubs for Asia. 
This means that Japan lags behind all of these competing 
concepts. 
  The issue of international airports is not restricted to a 
question of what should be done in the area of aviation 
administration. It is a major issue which will determine Japan's 
future. Ours is an "information age" and if Japan should be 
excluded from the principal international air routes, it will 
mean that Japan will be excluded from progress in the 
development of international information systems. Moreover, Asia 
is an economic growth region commanding the attention of the 
world. Lack of a hub airport will mean that the center of Asian 
information systems will be located in a country other than 
Japan. This issue is very important in terms of Japan's future. 
  In view of the foregoing discussion, Japan's policy of 
emphasing regional airports is an anachronism. We have arrived 
at a point where Japan's Transport Ministry bureaucrats must 
shift course and place highest priority on the conduct of a 
study to determine where the aviation industry should focus on 
this age of internationalization. 
<H5>  Conversion to a Bold Aviation Policy </H5>
  Two new issues await evaluation. First, we must embark on 
the 
construction of an international hub airport. Second, the 
project should be implemented with government funding. If the 
situation is neglected, Japan will not be able to participate in 
the progress occurring in terms of internationalization. Since 
the movement of people and the flow of information move in 
tandem, we must devise ways in which Japan serves as the center 
of people movement. 
  The reason why airport construction fails to make progress 
in 
Japan is attributable to the very high land prices. Construction 
costs are also high. It is difficult to acquire existing land 
necessary for airports, and reclamation of tidal basins for 
airport construction involves development costs. Even if an 
airport is built, we must face noise pollution and social issues 
associated with concentrations of people. Further, operation of 
an international hub airport precludes the suspension of night 
flights. 
  Further, one condition that must be satisfied relative to 
international hub airports is the enhancement of provisions for 
concentration of information systems. Accordingly, there is a 
need to build a major airport near principal urban centers, 
especially Tokyo. Recent proposals made by the Tokyo Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry refer to such a concept. However, Tokyo 
lacks surplus land that can be used for such a purpose. We can 
visualize futuristic concepts such as building runways in Chiba 
Prefecture and moving aircraft to Haneda via underwater tunnels, 
but in terms of infrastructure and using existing services, we 
should seek a viable concept in locating the airport near 
Haneda, Yokohama, or Kawasaki in Tokyo Bay. Residents of Tokyo, 
Kanagawa Prefecture, Kawasaki City, and Ota ward will probably 
take issue with any such location, but it is indispensable that 
a major international hub airport be built at an early date to 
provide for Japan's future. 
  Needless to say, many issues await resolution. The air zone 
issue is one of them. We now face the need to readjust flight 
patterns in air zones around Tokyo with the U.S. Air Force and 
the Self-Defense Forces. However, now that the confrontation 
between East and West has been dissolved, this issue should be 
relatively easy to solve. The noise pollution issue can probably 
be resolved by building runways on reclaimed land located some 
distance from the existing shores. Recently manufactured jumbo 
passenger planes have engines that produce less noise, and those 
with noisy engines can be subject to restrictions on night 
flights. Access to the airport via freeways and railways in the 
case of Haneda or Kawasaki can be placed underground. We will be 
faced with the need to modify navigation routes for ships, but I 
believe such modifications can be minimized. Moreover, a concept 
linking Haneda and Kawasaki for use by international and 
domestic flights to provide for an integrated international hub 
airport would produce efficiencies that defy the imagination. 
  Such a concept would enable Tokyo to become a base for 
linking the world and Asia in name and reality. Having 
conceptualized a hub airport, the full-scale airport should 
include a major four-lane runway and an auxiliary runway. The 
airport can be considered for use as a base for operating the 
information highway, to connect with new JR [Japan Railways] 
trunk lines leading to various parts of Japan and for 
development into a concept visualizing the development of a 
comprehensive transportation and information center. 
Fortunately, there is a new trunk line operations center near 
Haneda which should facilitate linkage of Haneda and the new 
trunk line. 
  Narita can be considered for use as a major base in handling 
rapidly increasing local air flights and air movement of 
high-technology products. Needless to say, Narita was plagued 
with a long history of difficulties associated with its 
construction and the Ministry of Transport's emotional ties 
thereto can be understood, but if conversion of Narita to a hub 
airport is difficult, it would be in the best interests of the 
country to undergo a bold conversion of concepts and to 
establish a new approach. In reality, Narita is in a remote 
location and in this age when international travelers have 
increased, use of Narita as an international airport translates 
into a waste of time and resources of a magnitude that should 
not be disregarded by Japan as a nation. 
<H5>  Major Airport as a National Project </H5>
  Another issue is that Japan should take up the airport issue 
as a national project. Under the current "Special Program for 
Airport Construction" system, the construction and maintenance 
of airports are almost entirely treated as a cost to be 
shouldered by airport users. The principle of user liability can 
be allowed. The reason is that we should not provide for special 
treatment of the aviation industry. 
  However, Japan's international airport landing and take-off 
fees are excessively high on an international comparison basis 
as they reflect the high land and construction costs. The fees 
are becoming unbearable for air line companies, while most of 
the high fees are shouldered by the passengers and translate 
into higher fares for flights departing from Japan. 
  Some time ago, only a segment of the population used air 
line 
services. However, if we think of today's usage running at the 
rate of 130 million individuals a year, I believe we should 
alter the current accounting system that focuses on increasing 
passenger fees to one which envisions the use of government 
funds for the construction of airports. I believe we can treat 
the construction of international hub airports as an exception 
to provide such government funding. This is an issue which 
should enjoy serious consideration by the government and 
resolution through a high-level political decisions. 
<H5>  Reduction in Landing Fees </H5>
  Further, referring to landing fees, we must admit that 
Japan's airport landing fees are the highest in the world. In 
comparison to Haneda's 840,000 yen, fees at foreign airports 
include 150,000 yen for New York's Kennedy Airport, 40,000 yen 
for Los Angeles, 250,000 yen for Seoul, 520,000 yen for 
Frankfurt (the highest in Europe), and only 90,000 yen for 
London's Heathrow Airport. These conditions have imposed 
difficulties on the operation of Japan's airlines and are one 
cause for increasing costs for travelers. The take-off and 
landing fees for the new Kansai Airport are also high and will 
exceed 900,000 yen. Therefore, it is only a matter of time 
before international airlines, which want to abandon Japan, 
will, for example, leave Japan when the new international 
airport in South Korea is completed. 
  The high take-off and landing fees have already become an 
international issue. For example, there is a strong possibility 
that this issue will be presented in the Japan-U.S. talks as an 
item of economic friction. If the center of international air 
routes shifts to another country, Japan will be the one to lose 
out. This is why we must confront the problem directly as a 
long-term strategic issue rather than as a matter of near-term 
interests. 
  Now that internationalization has progressed to this point, 
Japan should devote more government funds to the operation of 
airports. Since the high take-off and landing fees are already 
pose a major cost, if adequate repayment prospects can be 
identified, provisional measures can be made to divert fiscal 
investment and loan program funds and reduce landing fees to 
levels used at Seoul Airport. I believe we have reached a stage 
where government can cover certain aviation costs with public 
funds or fiscal investment and loan program funds if air fares 
are reduced about 10 percent. At a time when licensing fees are 
being hiked across the board, if a policy reversal can lead to 
lower fares in aviation, they may have a beneficial impact on 
other public utility rates and inspire the initiation of 
widespread rate cuts. 
  Presently, the aviation industry is most advanced in the 
United States. The growth of the U.S. aviation industry can be 
attributed to conditions which favored the growth of aviation 
such as the availability of spacious lands enabling the 
construction of airports and the spread of urban growth in 
numerous regions throughout the country. However, there were 
other reasons including the implementation of aviation 
administration reform through deregulation of route and fare 
structures in 1978. Such conditions led to aggressive management 
efforts to include new airlines entering the market, routes 
being established on an unregulated basis and cost reductions. 
One of the basic reasons for the effectiveness of such 
developments was that airports throughout the country had plenty 
of extra capacity. 
  Even in Japan the construction of regional airports 
exclusive 
of international hub airports has been completed. The remaining 
tasks include a fundamental change in aviation policies, 
enhancement of the political status of aviation administration 
and the establishment of a new integrated aviation 
administration for the age of internationalization.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito </F>
by unidentified SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI reporter: "Discussion on 
Major Modification Required of Aviation Administration"; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] This publishing house has been 
extremely troubled by your statement, during a press conference 
after the 8 March cabinet meeting, which became a topic of 
controversy in the newspapers and in which which you said, in 
effect, "A paper was published in SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI through 
oversight, without a thorough check on my part." 
  [Ito] What I wanted to say at the press conference was, 
"That 
was a paper that was written in collaboration with a friend and 
the lack of a thorough check on my part resulted in a failure to 
express myself adequately." In that respect, I would like to 
apologize for having troubled the editorial staff of your 
magazine as well as the readers. I have learned a lesson from 
the fact that I did not adequately review the paper as minister 
of transportation. 
<H5>  Passionate Sentiments About Narita </H5>
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] What sections of the paper are you 
referring to when you say you "failed to express yourself 
adequately"? 
  [Ito] I would like to say one thing before I discuss that 
aspect. It will not be long before we enter the 21st century, 
but the question now is whether it will be acceptable for 
21st-century transportation administration to remain an 
extension of current policies? I have strong feelings about 
this. I feel that our planning actions should be more 
comprehensive and mobile. 
  For example, I feel that there should be closer coordination 
between ministries for programs and actual construction of 
highway arteries like freeways that fall under the jurisdiction 
of the Ministry of Construction and the construction of railways 
and airports which come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry 
of Transport. 
  The other day, I spoke with the chairman of the German 
national railways, but in Germany almost all matters concerning 
transportation are the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Transport, including railways, roads, and airlines. Accordingly, 
gasoline taxes are allocated to cover costs of roads as well as 
railroads. Logically, they operate under the concept that a 
balance will be achieved in the administration of transportation 
systems as a whole in utilizing the special features of each 
means of transportation to the optimum degree feasible. 
  In this day of internationalization, Japanese domestic 
transportation networks are not complete in terms of domestic 
facilities alone. I believe we need to approach the issue from a 
much broader perspective. 
  Japan must not limit itself to its current midterm program 
and devise a plan which assumes a broader perspective of this 
nature and rethink its strategy so as to implement government 
investments that are consistent with the new approach. Absent 
such an approach, it will be impossible to create policies for 
the 21st century. I feel it is desirable to establish a forum 
consisting of interministerial representation and industry, 
public organization and business world participation, to debate 
such issues. 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Having established that premise, I 
believe the airport issue, especially the issue of Narita is of 
special significance... 
  [Ito] Yes, you have delineated the most important issue. I 
believe it is acceptable to have a comprehensive array of 
opinions concerning policy relative to Narita. 
  I have strong feelings about Narita because I was in charge 
of issues concerning Narita within the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ]. 
  Narita Airport was approved by the Sato cabinet in 1966, 
making it a full 28 years in July. Considering the situation at 
that time, it was as if the airport had fallen upon local 
residents from heaven. It was a decision made with hardly any 
reference to the logical rules of democratic society, resulting 
in an unfortunate and sustained dispute and complaints from 
local residents that "democracy did not exist in our locality." 
Even I participated in several opposition demonstrations and 
rallies and joined in scrambles with local residents. Whenever I 
reminisce about Narita, I feel I am looking back at the first 
half of my lifetime. 
  During sessions of the Diet's Standing Committee on 
Transportation, I was sharply questioned by members of the 
Liberal Democratic Party with the words, "We recall you 
participated in the movement to oppose Narita. What do you think 
of Narita now, as minister of transportation?" My reply in those 
instances would be, "It was wrong to approach the construction 
of the airport from an authoritarian posture. That being the 
case, the opposition movement was a logical phenomenon. I feel 
that my personal behavior at that time was correct in principle. 
However, I do not believe that I was 100 percent correct. I 
believe politicians should examine their pasts on a mutual and 
frank basis and assume a posture as to how they will cope with 
the future." 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] I understand a settlement is in 
progress 
with the opposing alliance. 
  [Ito] Because of the efforts exerted by Mr. Mikio Sumida of 
the investigation team, symposia open to the public were held 
for about 18 months which were attended by former Transportation 
Ministers Okuda and Ochi who expressed frank words of regret. 
  After my appointment as minister, roundtable discussions 
were 
initiated and I attended the first session. I conceptualized the 
establishment of an "airport for coexistence" with local 
residents and hope to exert sincere efforts in this area. 
<H5>  Need for Hub Airport </H5>
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] In the minister's treatise published in 
the 12 March edition of this magazine, you advocate the 
construction of an international hub airport which can serve as 
the center for international flow of people, things, and 
information. Can you explain the relationship between that 
concept and Narita? 
  [Ito] At the present time, Narita has only one runway. Even 
the Kansai International Airport which is to open in September 
has only one runway, which means that the complete conceptual 
development of the Kansai airport becomes a matter of the 
future. The Chubu International Airport will require further 
development in that it too has only one runway. Moreover, 
take-off and landing fees are the highest in the world. 
  Japan is surrounded by Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, Taiwan, 
China, and Hong Kong, which have plans to build airports with 
two to six 4,000-meter runways, scheduled for opening within 
several years. 
  I believe there are two schools of thought on this issue. 
One 
assumes the stance that we cannot afford to lose out to 
competition from our neighboring nations. And the other assumes 
the stance that Japan does not have the land, land prices are 
high, and it is acceptable that Japan will not possess an Asian 
hub airport. 
  However, I believe both postures reflect extremism and it is 
my belief that, disregarding any perception relative to status, 
there is a compelling reason for Japan to have an international 
airport that is compatible with its economic strength and its 
relationship with the rest of the world. I believe we should 
give serious consideration to an international airport based on 
the two premises covering coordination with neighboring nations 
and Japan's geographical configuration forming an extended 
archipelago from north to south. 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] I understand your goals. However, it is 
difficult for us to visualize a future design for Narita. 
  [Ito] Airports are not built only because there is a need 
for 
international hub airports. The aspect of coexistence with the 
local community is very important in the building of an airport. 
  Relative to Narita, I hope to hold symposia and roundtable 
discussions for thorough exchanges of views and strive 
assiduously to build an airport that can coexist with the local 
community. The approach of attempting to resolve issues through 
dialogue on the Narita issue is extremely significant in today's 
situation. 
  I hope to cherish this trend and continue my efforts aiming 
at early resolution of outstanding issues. 
  I feel sincere remorse in the sudden publication of the 
paper 
and the distrust inspired in the local community and among 
others concerned with Narita. 
  Further, speaking of the future, a supersonic aircraft 
capable of linking Japan and the United States in five to six 
hours is being developed for production sometime in the early 
21st century. Airports visualized for that aircraft when it goes 
into production include one each on the east and west coasts of 
the United States, one each in northeastern Asia and Australia, 
and one or two in Europe. There is a need to formulate policies 
with a view towards the age of the supersonic aircraft. 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Is the Ministry of Transport conducting 
research on that? 
  [Ito] No. We cannot say that an official study is being 
conducted. As a general statement, the business world and others 
can present the issue of a "superior international hub airport 
for Japan," but any such proposal from my perspective must be 
preceded by additional research. 
<H5>  Narita's Position </H5>
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] We too feel that a sense of crisis 
calling for a Japanese international hub airport lest we be 
abandoned by the rest of the world is logical. 
  One premise of a hub airport is that it must be a joint 
airport serving both international and domestic routes. However, 
it appears that the Ministry of Transport's plans for the 
second-stage project at Narita do not consider the idea of a 
joint airport. 
  [Ito] This is an item that requires future study. Full-scale 
international airports currently in existence are Narita and 
Kansai Airports. 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] That being the case, can we interpret 
your statement to mean that if Narita can be expanded, that 
domestic services will be increased and that it can become a 
hub-type airport? 
  [Ito] Construction at Narita Airport is being implemented 
with the primary idea of making it responsive to international 
airline requirements. We still haven't come to a decision on 
what we will do about domestic routes at Narita. As stated in 
the beginning of this discussion, we are currently engaged in an 
all-out effort to bring an end to 28 years of confrontation and 
dispute and to overcome those barriers. 
  When Narita is completed, the Kansai Airport opens and the 
Chubu International Airport is finished, we need to conduct a 
comprehensive study about how we will make use of each airport's 
special features and capabilities. 
<H5>  New Ideas About Airport Funding </H5>
  Whether we speak of building a new airport or expanding an 
existing airport to establish hub-type capabilities, funding 
becomes an important issue. Needless to say, there are methods 
such as funding from the general account budget or investing 
fiscal investment and loan program funds, but there is the 
argument that using such methods only for aviation would be 
unfair to competing projects such as those for railways. 
  However, the high take-off and landing fees at Japanese 
airports and the high airport user fees that are charged to 
individuals have become major international issues. What are 
your thoughts on the use of government funds? 
  [Ito] I believe we must exert new efforts in this area. 
  As an example, the idea that "rigidity in the distribution 
of 
public works investment funding must be modified" is an item 
agreed upon among the coalition parties and the Fiscal System 
Council is in the process of trying to assign priority to 
existing projects. 
  In the postwar period, many midterm programs were developed 
and implemented and some of them underwent more than 10 stages. 
I believe we have reached a point where such repetitive programs 
should be subject to reexamination. Those programs must be 
reexamined on the basis of the question of what policy goals are 
to be sought in a comprehensive outlook for the 21st century. 
  As an example, we speak of a welfare-type society, but we 
are 
not speaking of limited welfare programs. We are speaking of 
ensuring that roads and urban areas are designed so that they 
accommodate a wide array of welfare needs. Both the nature and 
content of public works projects must be designed to meet 
welfare needs. 
  Further, in the past we have been prone to place excess 
emphasis on hardware, but I believe we need to invest in 
software as well. We hear the slogan, "My Town Tokyo," but there 
is a need to consider the cultural and international environment. 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] Would it be correct for me to interpret 
your statements as saying that we should consider the use of 
government funds once we arrive at a consensus on the 
requirement for building airports, including hub airports, as we 
approach the 21st century? 
  [Ito] In the 50 or so years of the postwar period, separate 
actions were taken in building roads, airports, railways, and 
harbors. Roads were built with special funding derived from 
gasoline and automobile weight taxes and the five-year program 
incorporates the vast sum of 76 trillion yen. 
  On the other hand, central government and local government 
subsidies are provided for railways, subways, and the new trunk 
railways, but the approach is that their construction is handled 
autonomously, while the national railways have been privatized 
under the national railway reform program and are now referred 
to as JR [Japan Railways]. Some airport construction is 
government-funded, but the bulk of the money comes from usage 
fees. 
  Earlier I spoke of the German approach. I think we should 
consider their approach and the preceding discussion and decide 
on the government-investment approach. 
  [SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI] The high take-off and landing fees have 
been criticized both internationally and by the general public 
and require early resolution. 
  [Ito] They are certainly a major problem in terms of 
take-off 
and landing fees for international airports and are the subject 
of negotiations handled by the IATA (International Air Transport 
Association). However, this too is a structural issue. On the 
other hand, if fiscal investment and loan program funds or 
general account budget funds are used for the construction of 
domestic airports, we should be able to lower take-off and 
landing fees and opinions exist that say that that should lead 
to lower fares. 
  These issues are being energetically examined by the 
Aviation 
Council in terms of construction funding and take-off and 
landing fees with a target date of June of this year. I believe 
we should wait for the results of that study.

  [Text] The North Korean mission to the United Nations said 
today that North Korea has already started the work of replacing 
fuel rods at a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor without the presence 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. We have news 
by reporter Nam Son-hyon from New York. 
  [Begin Nam recording] The North Korean mission to the United 
Nations said that it sent a telex to IAEA Director General Hans 
Blix on 13 May in the name of Pak Yong-man, director of North 
Korean Atomic Energy General Department, officially notifying 
him that North Korea had started to replace fuel rods at the 
nuclear power plant [wonjaryok palchonsoe yonryobong 
kyochechakopi sichaktoeumul]. 
  According to the telex message sent by Pak Yong-nam, 
specially obtained by KBS, North Korea noted that from late 
April to early this month, it had notified the IAEA on four 
occasions that it could no longer delay the replacement of fuel 
rods. North Korea said that it regrets that it could no longer 
delay the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear reactor 
because of technical and safety problems [kisuljogurona 
anjonsangmunjerona to isang kyochechakopul mirulsuopssu]. 
  Director Pak Yong-nam said in the telex message: In spite of 
the special status [tuksuhan chiwiaraesodo] with the IAEA, North 
Korea has provided sufficient conditions to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards regarding the replacement of fuel rods, 
but the IAEA Secretariat did not respond to North Korea's good 
will [sonuijogin yogu], and instead put forward unreasonable 
conditions [pudanghan chogonul]. 
  North Korea said, however, that there are many opportunities 
for future negotiations regarding the issue because it just 
began the work, and stressed that if the IAEA shows its fair 
position, North Korea could allow the IAEA to choose and keep 
[sontaekkwa pogwan] fuel rods while they are being replaced. It 
also said that the future negotiations would be more productive 
when they are held at the place near the area where the work of 
replacing fuel rods is being started. 
  North Korea added in the telex message that it believes that 
it is fortunate that the IAEA has decided, though belatedly, to 
send the inspection team to Pyongyang and that it is ready to 
accept the inspection activities of an experimental nuclear 
power plant and a radiochemical laboratory, as mentioned 
earlier. [end recording]

  [Text] Washington, May 13 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
already begun changing nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt 
reactor in Yongbyon without the supervision of International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspectors. 
  In a telex message sent to IAEA headquarters in Vienna on 
Thursday, North Korea also said it was prepared to allow 
additional IAEA inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory. 
  Despite the latest development, the IAEA plans to send a 
team 
of inspectors on Sunday to check the radiochemical laboratory 
and service surveillance equipment in other facilities, IAEA 
spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna Friday. 
  The agency had insisted that its inspectors must be present 
when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt 
reactor. The IAEA said it would send inspectors only when 
Pyongyang postponed the refueling. 
  Nevertheless, the U.N. nuclear watchdog has decided to 
dispatch inspectors in the apparent belief that North Korea has 
not yet removed the fuel rods from the reactor, informed sources 
here said. 
  The United States has also said it would suspend dialogue 
with North Korea if it changed the fuel rods without an IAEA 
presence. But the sources said Washington will now decide 
whether to hold a third round of high-level talks after learning 
the outcome of the IAEA inspections. 
  State Department deputy spokesman David Johnson said 
Washington was not in a position to comment on further talks 
with North Korea until it heard from the IAEA on the result of 
the upcoming inspections. The IAEA alone must determine whether 
the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been 
maintained, Johnson said. Only then will the U.S. Government 
decide on the third round of negotiations. 
  What the United States is interested in right now is to 
choose the spent nuclear fuel rods at random and preserve them 
for later checks, said another State Department official, 
requesting anonymity. 
  Another diplomatic source here said "All is not clear at the 
moment" with regard to the changing of the nuclear fuel rods. 
However, it appears that North Korea has just begun preparations 
for refueling, rather than having taken fuel rods out of the 
reactor, he added. 
  The contents of Pyongyang's message to the IAEA will not 
influence the prospect for U.S.-North Korean talks, he said, 
adding that a firm evaluation of the overall situation will be 
made after the IAEA inspectors' visit. 
  Meanwhile, Pak Yong-nam, minister of the Atomic Energy 
Industry, said in the telex to the IAEA that North Korea was 
compelled to begin changing nuclear fuel rods because the IAEA 
had failed to send an inspection team, attaching unjustifiable 
conditions. 
  The message was addressed to IAEA Secretary-general Hans 
Blix. 
  Pyongyang nevertheless welcomed the IAEA's decision to send 
inspectors, though belatedly. North Korea will allow them to 
inspect its experimental nuclear power generating station and 
the radiochemical laboratory in order to maintain the continuity 
of nuclear safeguards, it said. 
  North Korea has also proposed resuming negotiations with the 
IAEA to resolve complicated problems with the refueling. 
  It would be more productive to hold the negotiations close 
to 
where the refueling is proceeding, it said, hinting that it 
wants to hold talks in Pyongyang. 
  Referring to the refueling, North Korea said work has just 
begun and that there would be many opportunities for the IAEA to 
collect the spent fuel rods at random and preserve them.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] warned 
on 14 May that if the work of replacing the North Korean nuclear 
fuel rods reaches "a serious stage," [simgakhan tangye] the IAEA 
inspection team will suspend its inspection and leave earlier 
than scheduled. 
  IAEA spokesman David Kyd said that the inspection team will 
leave Vienna on 15 May and arrive in Yongbyon, North Korea 
sometime on 17 May. He said that the inspection team will 
confirm whether North Korea has just started regular preparation 
measures to replace the fuel rods at the five megawatt-class 
atomic reactor or it has already reached "a serious stage" of 
carrying out the replacement work such as unloading the nuclear 
rods. He added that the inspection team is scheduled to stay in 
North Korea for eight days, but that their stay there may be 
extended.

<F P=106> [Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Three members of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team have embarked on a visit to North 
Korea to confirm whether North Korea's nuclear fuel rods have 
actually been replaced and to conduct additional inspections. 
  The three-member inspection team, led by IAEA inspection 
chief (Hainamen), left for Vienna via China on the evening of 15 
May, Korean standard time, and is due to arrive in Beijing at 
0840 on 16 May. 
  The inspection team, entrusted with the special mission to 
make on-the-spot confirmation of the nuclear fuel rods 
replacement, will make a stopover in Beijing and arrive in 
Pyongyang via Koryo Civilian Air on the afternoon of 17 May. 
  During its stay, the inspection team will confirm on the 
spot 
whether nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon 
have actually been replaced. The IAEA will call off its 
inspection and pull out its team earlier than scheduled if North 
Korea has removed the nuclear fuel rods seals and replaced the 
nuclear fuel rods. However, if North Korea has just begun 
preparations for the nuclear fuel rods replacement, the 
inspection team will carry out inspection activities until 24 
May. It will check seals and replace surveillance equipment at 
major nuclear facilities, and conduct additional inspections of 
the radiochemical laboratory.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Monday [16 May] spurned afresh an opposition call for an 
early general election under the current multiseat constituency 
system, arguing it would undermine political reform. 
  Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that 
the next election should be held under the new system, a mixture 
of 300 single-seat districts and 200 others chosen through 
proportional representation. 
  Holding a general election under the current system would 
"make the efforts so far toward political reform retrogress," he 
said. 
  A government panel is drawing up the electoral map in line 
with a political reform package passed in January, which 
mandates the replacement of the multiseat constituency system 
with the new one. 
  Hata rejected a call by Shoichi Ichikawa of the Japanese 
Communist Party (JCP) for dissolving the House of 
Representatives and holding a snap election under the current 
system, which Ichikawa said is fairer than the proposed new 
system. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the second largest opposition party, last week called for 
early elections to restore stable government. 
  Hata faced a series of attacks by opposition lawmakers in 
the 
threee-day Diet plenary sessions that ended Monday over the 
fragile political standing of his minority government. 
  The premier repeatedly expressed readiness for dialogue with 
the opposition parties and sought their cooperation to cope with 
a heap of pending issues. 
  Hata pledged policy continuity from the administration of 
his 
predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned in April over 
dubious management of his personal finances, and appealed for 
the opposition's cooperation to tackle some "historical tasks" 
carried over from the previous cabinet, such as tax and 
political reform. 
  Hata tried to reassure the nation that he will stick to the 
government's traditional view of the constitution, which 
restricts Japan's military to a "minimum necessary" self-defense. 
  Hata, however, skirted the vital issue of possible 
involvement by Japan in international sanctions against North 
Korea over its suspected nuclear arms program. 
  He said he would not comment on any problems concerning the 
issue since such sanctions are not being discussed at the UN 
Security Council. 
  But he said that in general terms, Japan's cooperation with 
the United Nations or the United States over an international 
crisis should be "within the framework of the constitution." 
  Hata also made a renewed vow to seek Japan's permanent 
membership in the Security Council. 
  Japan should obtain a permanent seat in the key UN council 
to 
break the monopoly by the victors of World War II, he said. 
  Hata said there is a growing call in the UN for Japan to 
play 
a larger role in the council in which he says many important 
global issues are decided.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Monday [16 May] made a renewed pledge to seek permanent 
membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC], saying Japan 
should gain a permanent seat in the key council to break its 
monopoly by war victors. 
  Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that 
there is a growing voice in the United Nations for Japan to play 
a larger role in the key UN forum, which was set up by the 
victors of World War II. 
  Hata said many important issues, including even environment 
and population problems, are decided at the council. 
  "There is a call in the UN in the new age for Japan to play 
a 
role," Hata said. 
  The premier responded to questions by Manso Hamamoto of the 
Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and Akira Kuroyanagi of 
Komeito over Hata's key policy speech before the Diet last week. 
  Hata also said the government is working on objective 
criteria to measure progress in Japan's market opening steps to 
reduce its huge trade surplus with the U.S., but reiterated his 
refusal to set numerical targets. 
  While stressing the importance of improving soured trade 
ties 
with the U.S., Hata said setting numerical targets would run 
counter to the efforts for administrative reform aimed at 
lessening the government's intervention in the private sector. 
  The bilateral talks under a trade framework agreement 
foundered in February, when former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa rejected demands by U.S. President Bill Clinton for 
numerical targets to gauge market access improvement in some 
sectors, such as in autos, insurance and medical equipment 
procurement.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and select cabinet ministers will huddle Tuesday [17 May] to 
consider ways to promote deregulation, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said Monday. 
  The meeting comes after Hata and six members of his cabinet 
agreed last week on the need to come up with powerful steps by 
the end of June to ease economically restrictive government 
regulations. 
  Hata's government has vowed to thrash out full-scale 
deregulatory measures before this year's summit meeting of the 
Group of Seven major industrialized nations as part of efforts 
to spur domestic demand and boost imports. 
  The session is scheduled to convene before a regular cabinet 
meeting on Tuesday morning, the top government spokesman told a 
news conference. 
  In addition to key cabinet ministers, the planned 
get-together will invite heads of ministries and agencies that 
dictate regulations, Kumagai said. 
  Participants will include Hata, Kumagai, Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International 
Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Management and 
Coordination Agency chief Koshiro Ishida and Economic Planning 
Agency head Yoshio Terasawa. 
  The others will be heads of ministries of health and 
welfare, 
farm, transport, posts and telecommunications, construction, and 
home affairs, as well as the national land agency chief. 
  The head of the Fair Trade Commission will also attend, 
Kumagai said.

  [Text] Kuroiso, Tochigi Pref., May 14 KYODO -- Former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe urged the minority coalition 
government Saturday [14 May] to seek cooperation from the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to tide over the 
unstable political situation. 
  Watanabe, leader of the LDP's third largest faction, said in 
a lecture that the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
"should not hate the LDP and (should realize that) it cannot 
live without asking help of the LDP from the front entrance." 
  He apparently balked at coalition's attempt to lure the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) to return to the coalition and 
pressed the government and the LDP leadership to promote 
cooperation between the LDP and the coalition. 
  "The cabinet, with a support of only one-third (members) in 
the House of Representatives, could not stand for the people's 
view," Watanabe said. 
  He said that there is the possibility that the LDP will 
propose a no-confidence motion against the cabinet following the 
Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  In April, Watanabe threatened to leave the LDP in a bid to 
seek the premiership, hoping to gain possible backing from some 
of the coalition. 
  Despite the abortive bid for the premership, he has not lost 
his aspiration for power, saying in Saturday's lecture "if there 
are more stages to push through my own principles, I will do so."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 14 KYODO -- Economic discussions at the 
Group of Seven (G-7) summit to be held in Naples, Italy, in July 
will focus on ways of securing economic growth and employment, 
government sources said Saturday [14 May]. 
  The agenda will also include aid to South Africa and Russia, 
ways of controlling money laundering in connection with drug 
trafficking, and trade and the environment, the sources said. 
  The agenda was agreed on at a recent meeting of 
representatives for leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan and the United States, who will take part in the 
July 8-10 summit. 
  The sources said Japan is likely to face intense pressure 
during the discussions to expand its domestic demand and reduce 
its trade surplus. 
  To help mitigate the pressure regarding the trade surplus, 
Japan's ruling minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will have to make a hard political decision before the 
summit on proposed tax reforms as a pillar of measures to expand 
domestic demand, the sources said. 
  Specifically, the discussions are likely to center on 
additional fiscal measures and a relaxation of monetary 
restraints in Japan and Germany, where economic recovery has 
been slow, the sources said. 
  The U.S. will also be asked to cut its fiscal deficit as 
part of efforts to control inflation, they said. 
  Concerning employment, U.S. President Bill Clinton is 
expected to propose a global jobs creation program at the summit 
to deal with structural unemployment. 
  Regarding foreign aid, the summit is likely to agree to give 
coordinated aid to South Africa, now under black President 
Nelson Mandela, for its political stability, the sources said. 
  They also said the meeting is expected to agree on increased 
G-7 aid to Russia to help its transition to a market economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 14 KYODO -- The government is aiming to 
enact a package of bills to revise 40 laws in order to relax 
economically restrictive government regulations during the 
current Diet session, government officials said Saturday [14 
May]. 
  The government will submit the package to the Diet after 
approving it next Friday, the officials said. The current Diet 
session ends on June 29. 
  The package is in line with economic stimulus measures 
announced last April and September. 
  The government has vowed to come up with full-scale 
deregulatory measures by the end of June as part of efforts to 
spur domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite for imports. 
  If enacted, 134 items of regulations will be abolished, 16 
items will be relaxed and 27 items will be rationalized, the 
officials said. 
  Among the laws to be revised by the bills is one to abolish 
obligations to report to the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) the establishment of an export and import 
association. 
  The officials said the government hopes the enactment of the 
bills will help revitalize activity in the private sector.

  [Text] Atami, Shizuoka Pref., May 14 KYODO -- A Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] policy study group 
decided Saturday [14 May] to oppose a motion calling for the 
dismissal of House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee 
Chairman Keiwa Okuda, group members said. 
  The motion against Okuda was submitted to the lower chamber 
secretariat Friday by the largest opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), which has 206 members in the 511-seat lower chamber. 
  The LDP, which lost its 38-year grip on power last summer, 
is 
now stepping up a drive to take back power from the coalition 
government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, which was reduced to 
a minority government following the SDP's departure from the 
coalition last month. 
  Okuda is a member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], whose 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa has been acting as chief 
coalition strategist and is regarded as the prime force in 
sweeping Hata to power. 
  The SDP study group, called "Democrats" which has a 
parliamentary strength of 23 lower chamber seats, made the 
decision not to support the motion in a meeting of its 
legislators and local supporters in Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture. 
  Former SDP Chairman Makoto Tanabe told the meeting, 
"Allowing 
the LDP to depose the Diet Steering Committee chairman on the 
strength of the (large) number of legislators would amount to 
undercutting parliamentary democracy." 
  The LDP may not be able to push the motion through the lower 
chamber, as the group's decision to dissent may prompt other 
legislators to vote against it, political sources said. 
  The LDP's initial plan to formally table the motion on the 
floor of the lower chamber on Tuesday may be scrapped, they said. 
  The 74-member SDP is considered the swing vote in the lower 
house because neither the LDP nor the governing coalition, which 
controls 182 seats, single-handedly have a majority in the lower 
chamber. 
  The study group also decided to oppose another move by the 
LDP to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata 
administration, the legislators said. 
  The group will instead become a driving spirit behind a move 
to establish a fresh coalition government by soliciting into its 
fold liberal legislators from the new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger], the Democratic Socialist Party, the Japan New Party 
as well as members of the LDP, they said. 
  The group will try to put together legislators from a wide 
political spectrum who can uphold their ideals of scaling down 
the self-defense forces, expanding Japan's noncombatant roles in 
U.N. peacekeeping operations, and shifting emphasis from direct 
to indirect and asset tax, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
have yet to decide if they will discuss resuming the trade 
framework talks during upcoming bilateral subcabinet-level 
consultations, a senior Japanese Trade Ministry official said 
Monday [16 May]. 
  The May 24 high-level meeting in Washington is intended to 
discuss the bilateral cooperation in the environment and other 
global areas, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and 
industry minister, told a press conference. 
  Both parties are uncertain whether or not they will touch on 
sectoral trade issues in the meeting, over which the framework 
talks became stalled, Kumano said. 
  The framework talks have been deadlocked since the February 
meeting of then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The talks broke down when Tokyo rejected U.S. demands for 
Japan to introduce numerical targets in three priority fields of 
government procurement, insurance, and autos and auto parts, to 
measure American manufacturers' access to these markets. 
  Global topics to be taken up at the coming Washington 
meeting 
for bilateral cooperation are also covered under the framework 
talks launched in July 1993.

<F P=106> [by Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Recent remarks by a cabinet 
minister denying Japan's wrongdoing before and during World War 
II has reopened deep scars in Asia. 
  When Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano said the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre was a "fabrication" and that it was wrong to call 
Japan's invasion of Asian neighbors aggression, it also revived 
doubts about the way Japan perceives history, particularly its 
wartime role. 
  "The Japanese may often be confused about their history," 
said a passage in an editorial in THE PHILIPPINES DAILY INQUIRER. 
  Another Manila paper, today, expressed fear of living under 
the "spectral threat of a militarily resurgent Japan which 
hasn't learned one thing from its shameful history of 
aggression." 
  The South Korean and Chinese Governments also protested 
Nagano's remarks as distorting historical facts. 
  For the Japanese Government, Nagano's blunder occurred at an 
"unfortunate" time since the new administration of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata was expected to follow in the footsteps of 
his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, regarding Japan's wartime 
role and offer formal apologies for Japan's wartime atrocities. 
  Last summer Hosokawa became the first Japanese prime 
minister 
to use the words "aggression and colonial rule" in referring to 
Japan's actions before and during World War II. 
  But the 71-year-old Nagano, who had been first lieutenant in 
the Japanese Imperial Army and later chief of staff of the 
Ground Self- Defense Force, is the latest in a number of 
politicians to create an international uproar by the slip of the 
tongue regarding Japan's wartime actions. 
  Nagano resigned after only 10 days in office. 
  In 1986, then Education Minister Masayuki Fujio was 
dismissed 
by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for saying Koreans were 
partly to blame for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the 
Korean peninsula. In 1990, a lower house member, Shintaro 
Ishihara, said the story of the Nanjing massacre was made up by 
the Chinese. 
  China estimates that Japanese Imperial Army troops massacred 
more than 300,000 civilians following their invasion of then 
Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. Japanese 
historians cite lower estimates of around 100,000. 
  "I think people of that generation truly believed what they 
said," said Roger Buckley, professor of history at International 
Christian University, about politicians who make remarks 
downplaying Japan's wartime role. 
  Buckley, while pointing out that formal apology is 
necessary, 
said he fears such comments by politicians will influence 
Japan's younger generation. 
  Education authorities have frequently been criticized, both 
at home and abroad, for not giving sufficient attention to 
teaching that period of history. Textbooks for use at schools 
also are subject to government approval. 
  A senior diplomat said the concept among the Japanese of the 
period from around late 1930s to World War II is fuzzy, while 
good history books about the era are also unavailable. That, 
said the official, is why university entrance exams hardly 
include any questions about the country's modern history. 
  But efforts are being made to ward off criticism about 
history teaching. 
  A foreign ministry-affiliated organization recently 
published 
"Japan in Modern History," which offers translations of history 
textbooks used in Japan's elementary and junior high schools, 
the first such attempt in Japan. 
  The books, published by the International Society for 
Educational Information, extracted and translated parts dealing 
with Japan's role in the world from the late 19th century 
through early 1900s from three textbooks each from elementary 
and junior high schools used since 1992 and 1993, respectively. 
  The three texts each account to about 70 percent of 
textbooks 
used by primary and junior high students in Japan, according to 
the institute. 
  The "Japan in Modern History" is also available in Chinese 
and Korean and the translations of high school textbooks are 
also on the way. 
  "By solely offering translations of the textbooks without 
giving any comments or analysis, people interested in Japanese 
textbooks can see for themselves how Japan is teaching modern 
history at schools," said Fumi Miyamoto, director of an 
institute which aims to boost mutual understanding among people 
everywhere. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada, in distributing 
the English translations to foreign reporters, said the 
publication aims to show that, "we're seriously teaching our 
schoolchildren." 
  "I think its quite true... That in the early 1980s 
historical 
facts were not well reflected in school textbooks," Terada said. 
"But gradually the quality of textbooks has improved." 
  Two of the elementary school texts and all three junior high 
texts translated in the "Japan in Modern History" described the 
Nanjing massacre. 
  The institute plans to distribute the books to schools, book 
stores, local governments and local education boards in Japan 
while the Foreign Ministry will distribute them abroad, the 
institute said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 14 KYODO -- Chinese Mafia bosses in Hong 
Kong and Taiwan are controlling the so-called "snake head" 
organization which smuggles Chinese workers into Japan, National 
Police Agency sources said Saturday [14 May]. 
  The organization is well-commanded, with several executives 
supporting the boss. Chinese henchmen lure farmers and 
fishermen to work in Japan, the sources said. 
  In cases of Chinese illegally entering Japan in groups, only 
18 in two groups arrived in 1990, but the number has sharply 
increased, to 396 in 14 groups in 1992 and 335 in seven groups 
in 1993. 
  This year, over 250 Chinese in eight groups have already 
been 
smuggled into Japan, including a group of nearly 100 that 
arrived in Shimane Prefecture on a freighter this week, they 
said. 
  The "snake head" organization arranges various methods for 
illegal entry, such as traveling hidden on fishing boats and 
freighters or with forged passports, they said. 
  After they arrive in Japan, residents from either China, 
Hong 
Kong or Taiwan or Japanese "yakuza" gangs guide the workers. 
  The illegal immigrants pay about 200,000 yen as security to 
gain entry, paying more after the attempt succeeds, the sources 
said. 
  The primary targets of the organization are farmers in 
suburban areas and fishermen working in aquiculture, and those 
who hope to work in Japan to make more money, they said. 
  "Snake head" members lure them with the promise of a safe 
and 
comfortable journey, but they are actually packed in the hold of 
freighters and are only given instant noodles twice a day, they 
said. 
  The organization sometimes holds the illegal entrants in 
Japan until they pay the remaining fee, or abandons them without 
giving them job they were promised, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Uzbekistan's President Islam 
Karimov arrived Monday [16 May] on a four-day visit for talks 
with Japanese Government and business leaders. 
  Karimov, 56, will meet with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
Tuesday evening after an audience with Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko in the morning, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Hata is expected to express Japan's interest in securing 
stability in Central Asia and voice support for Uzbekistan's 
reform efforts, the officials said. 
  Supporting Uzbekistan's reform efforts is important since 
the 
country has the largest population in Central Asia. 
  Hata is also likely to tell Karimov that Japan is interested 
in helping solve environmental problems surrounding the Aral 
Sea. He will also call for expanding personnel exchanges 
between Japan and Uzbekistan. 
  The two leaders are also expected to discuss international 
affairs. 
  During Karimov's visit, Japan will pledge cultural 
grant-in-aid, humanitarian aid and technical cooperation to 
Uzbekistan, the officials said. 
  Officials accompanying the Uzbek leader include Deputy Prime 
Minister Otkir Sultanov, who is also minister of foreign 
economic relations, and Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Saidqasymov. 
  Karimov will visit the western Japan cities of Kyoto and 
Osaka before leaving for home Thursday.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Failure of U.S.-Indonesia Talks on </F>
Textiles"] 
  [Text] Problems always exist. Bilateral talks on textile 
production and export between the United States and the 
Goverment of Indonesia took place last week. This is a routine 
annual procedure as the period draws near marking the end of 
Indonesia's textile export quota to the United States. The 
talks mainly centered on the U.S. decision regarding Indonesia's 
annual textile export quota. 
  The failed talks were considered normal. Similar talks on 
textile quotas between the two nations have also failed 
previously and no agreements were then achieved. However, some 
of the talks have proven successful. 
  Indonesia's textile export was considered disappointing if 
it 
is observed within the context that its nongas exports achieved 
a level off [preceding two words in English]. 
  As a rule, Indonesia will make official its new request for 
an increase in its export quota on 1 July. But the U.S. 
insisted on holding a meeting in connection with the access of 
its commodities into Indonesia's market, including the issue of 
property right [preceding two words in English]. Indonesia 
clarified that its delegation was not empowered with the mandate 
of discussing such an issue because it was not related to the 
textile export quota. Thus, the talks collapsed. 
  But we view such a failure with a deeper perspective. First, 
the recently concluded talks were similar to previous talks, and 
the Indonesian delegation forwarded several requests in its bid 
to increase the textile export quota accorded by the U.S.. 
However, when the USTR [United States Trade Representative] 
requested certain concessions as a counter request, Indonesia 
could not grant such requests. 
  Indonesia probably practiced this strategy from the 
beginning. It is also likely that Indonesia made an earlier 
prediction that its request for access to the U.S. market would 
be turned down, acknowledging the fact that the United States as 
a superpower arrives at such decisions in most of its trade 
negotiations. Fortunately, the latest failed talks did not 
leave a negative impact on us because there will be more time 
for such talks in the future. 
  We perceive that the present and future economic 
globalization will depend on a change of attitude in trade 
negotiations. We also consider that our current strategic 
physical location is becoming less important to the United 
States global economic and political strategy. What we need is 
more economic and trade concessions, including an increase in 
the textile export quota. 
  Most of the previous trade relations brought about mutual 
benefit. But it is imperative for economic globalization to 
bring about mutual benefit. Economic globalization emphasizes a 
win-win situation [preceding three words in English]. 
  Therefore, Indonesia should be prepared to make certain 
concessions during future negotiations if its requests for more 
concessions are to be realized, particularly with regard to its 
request for an increased textile export quota. Our only 
strategy in the recent talks on textile export quotas was 
through giving an explanation that our delegation was not 
empowered with the mandate of making concessions during the 
limited trade negotiations. 
  It should also be taken into consideration that we are 
currently unable to forecast the U.S. aspirations in trying to 
increase its exports -- prior to the negotiations on the textile 
export quota. Furthermore, the Indonesian delegation which 
participated in the limited negotiations was not the best 
delegation empowered to make decisions. 
  In this connection, we wish to point out that the 1992 
U.S.-Indonesia textile negotiations were successful because 
Indonesia agreed to provide two concessions to the U.S., namely 
the entry of U.S. films and fruit into Indonesian markets. This 
was considered a precedent. Therefore, the USTR's demand for 
access to Indonesia's market and protection of the property 
right [preceding two words in English] do not come as a surprise 
or were considered extraordinary issues in connection with the 
trade negotiations between the two countries. 
  Second, the concluded bilateral negotiations on the textile 
quota issue were too formal. The Indonesian delegation met with 
the USTR team and, as far as we know, forwarded a request for an 
increased quota of exports to the United States -- including 
quotas on several other categories. On the other hand, the USTR 
pressed for a meeting on the issue of providing access for U.S. 
commodities into the Indonesian market and the property rights 
issue. The talks also collapsed due to disagreement. 
  Prior to the negotiations, no contact or lobbying was done 
to 
find out how Indonesia's request was met by the U.S. in 
connection with textile exports. Such measures were also not 
carried out when other discussions ended in a deadlock. Several 
Indonesian textile industrialists also participated in the last 
negotiations with the U.S. side. Unfortunately, textile 
industrialists who have access to lobbying and who had 
established earlier personal contact with the USTR, Foreign 
Relations Department, Agriculture Department, Inland Revenue 
Department, the Congress (House of Representatives and the 
Senate), and American businessmen were not included in the 
delegation. 
  Actually, Indonesia previously experienced similar 
negotiations in 1989 where personal contacts and lobbying played 
an important role in turning the negotiations into a success and 
diverting a deadlock. The USTR agreed to increase export quotas 
on textile and several other categories until the increase 
exceeded the limit. This was due to informal lobbying carried 
out outside the official negotiations. 
  In other words, Indonesia's delegation to the recently 
concluded negotiations did not lobby or embark on informal 
personal contacts during its mission to seek a desirable and 
favorable outcome. 
  Third, prior to the start of negotiations on the textile 
export quota, officials of the United States Embassy in Jakarta 
contacted a number of industrialists and economic experts in 
connection with the Indonesian delegation to the negotiations. 
Those who were contacted believed that the United States was 
not concerned with the quality of the Indonesian delegation. 
This resulted in queries about Indonesia's seriousness about 
the negotiations. In fact, almost all categories of the textile 
export quota to the United States have not been fulfilled [as 
published] during the current quota year (1 July 1993 to 30 June 
1994). Thus, why should Indonesia ask for an additional quota? 
  Regarding the quota issue, the United States has long 
monitored the allocation and management of the textile export 
quota. The United States along with the EC, Canada, and the 
Scandinavian countries allocate the quota for the sake of 
developing the textile industry in developing nations. 
Accordingly, the quota is allocated free of charge. However, 
the textile export quota has been commercialized and has become 
a source of income for those not engaged in the textile industry 
in Indonesia. In fact, this runs counter to the original 
objective of the United States, the EC, and the Scandinavian 
countries.

  [Text] Speaking at Sukarno-Hatta International Airport 
after concluding his visit to Europe, Switzerland and South 
Africa, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said all Indonesian Embassy 
staff and their family members are safe in Sana'a, Yemen. He 
stressed that the wives and children of the Indonesian Embassy 
staff would be evacuated first if the situation worsens. The 
evacuation process will be coordinated with the other foreign 
missions. Since the recent outbreak of civil war between North 
and South Yemen, a steady stream of refugees has been seen 
leaving the affected zones daily. 
  Touching on the issue concerning a group of New Zealand 
parliamentarians feeling agitated over the East Timor issue, 
Alatas stressed that they were not given complete and true 
information with regard to the East Timor issue. 
  According to the minister, the attitude of the 
parliamentarians stems from the concern of a minor group of 
people who were ill-informed about the East Timor issue.

  [Text] Jambi, May 14 (ANTARA) - President Suharto here 
over the weekend asked people to respect the nation's unity and 
refrain from doing odd actions that could turn into riots and 
cause a backward step. 
  "There are groups of people that are impatient and do 
something that could shake the national stability. There are 
also groups that are wishing to use the Western concepts such as 
on the implementation of human rights and democracy principles," 
said the head of state. 
  At a meeting with the local residents after inaugurating the 
212-km Eastern Transroad project, the president said that not 
all of the Western concept suit the culture and attitude of the 
nation. 
  "If it (the concept) is just adopted to our system, it would 
turn into something like a "scarecrow" in the rice field," he 
stressed. 
  He said that by mastering the science and technology, people 
could exploit the richest of the natural resources. 
  "By mastering the science and technology, we could export 
the 
non-oil commodities," he said. 
  He pointed out knowledge and science that mastered by 
employees of the national aircraft industry which has turn to 
the capability of manufacturing some components of the U.S. 
Boeing and F-16 fighter Falcon. 
  He also mentioned the capability of Indonesian shipping 
company, PT PAL, who is now able to produce many various types 
of vessels. 
  "Mastering the science and technology could not wait for the 
time," said President Suharto, who was accompanied by Mrs. Tien 
Suharto, Public Works Minister Radinal Mokhtar, State 
Minister/Secretray of the Cabinet Saadilah Mursyid, and Jambi 
Governor Abdurrahman Sayuti.

<F P=106> [Unsigned Editorial: "Indonesian Non-Oil-and-Gas Exports </F>
Cannot Keep Rising Sharply"] 
  [Text] The realization is increasingly emerging that 
Indonesia's non-oil-and-gas exports cannot keep rising sharply. 
This time it is Prof. Dr. Suhadi Mangkusuwondo, economist at the 
FEUI [Economic Faculty of the University of Indonesia] and 
member of the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] group of 
"eminent persons," who has expressed it. 
  It is true that Indonesia's non-oil-and-gas exports continue 
to rise from year to year in absolute volumes and values, but 
the rate of increase is steadily declining. Meanwhile, it is 
difficult to expect any increase in oil and gas exports. 
  In 1993, Indonesian exports rose by 8.41 percent over 1992. 
That increase was lower than during the 1988-1992 period (an 
average of 15.8 percent). Thus, there is a trend toward steadily 
lower increases. Again, we should note that what is declining is 
the increase, not the absolute volume or value. 
  This has been a problem for economists and economic policy 
makers for the last two or three years and will be a big problem 
in the future. It is not a new problem, however. In 1989, while 
Indonesia was euphoric over increases of more than 15 percent in 
non-oil-and-gas exports, Dr. Iwan Jaya Azis, another FEUI 
economist, warned us and predicted the current situation. 
  Iwan said that after 1992, increases in non-oil-and-gas 
exports would decline and would continue to do so. He said it is 
very probable that non-oil-and-gas exports will level off after 
1995. That was said merely from the viewpoint of Indonesia's 
ability to increase its non-oil-and-gas exports (capabilities of 
resources, production, and competitiveness on international 
markets), without considering any other factors. 
  There are factors now that did not enter into calculations 
at 
that time. One of them is GATT. Its impact and consequences will 
be felt gradually over the next several years. In general, GATT 
will create freer world trade, which, as far as possible, will 
be without tariff and nontariff barriers. It requires that each 
country be able to compete in international trade and demands 
more production, investment, and trade. 
  It means an opportunity to increase non-oil-and-gas exports, 
but it also means a threat to Indonesia if we are not able to 
take advantage of it and fulfill its requirements or if we are 
not able to compete in an atmosphere of sharper competition. 
  We have also read predictions that the developing countries 
will lose much export revenue because of the introduction of 
GATT. In fact, it is predicted that Indonesia will lose the 
most. We need not believe such predictions or assessments, 
although they are not without basis. Moreover, Indonesia's 
capabilities are viewed and assessed through foreign eyes. In 
other words, the predictions may not come true, or they may. 
  We should accept such assessments as warnings to be alert 
and 
to act. Prof. Suhadi Mangkusuwondo suggests that we look again 
at our investment capabilities, because increases in exports 
depend on such capabilities, which include our ability to 
attract foreign investment. 
  We feel that is not enough, however. There are several other 
factors, including our ability to spot opportunities on world 
markets consistent with our capabilities. We need to be wise by 
selecting what we are capbable of doing in exports, for we 
cannot export every commodity and every service. 
  There is another matter that has not been touched on very 
much, because it has not been acknowledged as a big problem. 
When it has been touched on, it apparently has not been done 
very directly. 
  We have been faced with changes through a variety of 
deregulation measures. Their objective has been to restrain the 
high-cost economy and increase competitiveness with exports and, 
domestically, with imports. Nevertheless, hindrances in the form 
of bureaucratic costs -- both official and under-the-table -- 
and collusion between officials and businessmen are increasingly 
visible as the main factors in Indonesia's high-cost economy. 
  It cannot be denied that exports are the mainstay of 
Indonesia's economy. The dependence of our economy on 
non-oil-and-gas exports will increase in the future. Exports 
will be even more the source of financing for development and 
the source of loan payments. 
  In our opinion, there are three things we could experience 
in 
the future in our economy, including exports. First, we could 
continue to be surprised by the rapid and continuous changes 
that occur as the result of globalization in the economy and in 
technology, information, and telecommunications. For example, 
the export commodities that Indonesia depends on, and that 
represent our "prima donna" exports, could suddenly cease to 
sell or suddenly decline in revenues because of those changes. 
  Second, we might not be prepared to adapt or able to react 
to 
the changes that occur in the world. The consequences could 
affect our economy, and development could also be hindered. 
  Third, the changes could force us, for the sake of the 
survival of our economy, to make alterations that actually are 
unwanted by some interest groups. The fact is, the choice is up 
to us.

  [Text] Indonesia now has Air Combat Maneuvering Range 
(ACMR) fighter training facilities using Global Positioning 
System (GPS) technology, which is capable of monitoring the 
movements of fighter planes at all positions within its range. 
  The ACMR facilities built at the Pekanbaru Airfield in Riau 
are one type of bilateral cooperation between the Republic of 
Indonesia Armed Forces (ABRI) and the Republic of Singapore Air 
Force (RSAF). Plans are for ABRI's Commander in Chief and 
Singapore's Commander of Defense Forces to dedicate the ACMR 
Building today (22 March); the ministers of defense and security 
(MENHAN) of the two countries will sign the inscription and cut 
the ribbon. 
  Dr Yeo Ning Hong, Singapore's Minister of Defense, 
accompanied by the secretary general of Singapore's Ministry of 
Defense Lim Siong Guan, by Air Force Chief of Staff Brig Gen Bey 
Soo Khiang, and by Navy Chief of Staff Commodore Kwek Sien Jin, 
were in Jakarta yesterday to meet with a number of Indonesian 
officials, including Minister of Defense and Security Edi 
Sudradjat. 
  Plans are for the group of Singaporean defense and security 
officials to leave for Riau this morning together with a group 
headed by the Minister of Defense and Security of the Republic 
of Indonesia to attend the ceremony dedicating the ACMR Building 
at the Pekanbaru Airfield. 
  In yesterday's meeting at the Department of Defense and 
Security, Edi Sudradjat and Yeo Ning Hong discussed 
technological developments in the field of defense and security, 
in particular the development of aerospace technology. The two 
ministers of defense and security also discussed efforts to 
increase cooperation between the two nations. 
<H5>  ACMR Excellence </H5>
  The purpose of constructing ACMR training facilities in 
Pekanbaru is to increase the skills and quality of training in 
air firing for ABRI and RSAF fighter pilots, who up to now have 
gotten firing training from the air or at the Air Weapon Range 
(AWR) in Siabu, Riau. 
  The ACMR facilities are equipped with Air Borne Pod training 
equipment made available by the Singapore Air Force. The Air 
Borne Pod equipment is located on the undercarriage of the 
fighter planes, which allows the maneuvers made by the fighter 
planes in the vicinity of Pekanbaru to be captured by the 
Satellite and Radar Tower Erection and by Real Time Tracking and 
Positioning (RTTP) monitored on Base Control Debriefing Station 
(BCDS) screens. 
  This ACMR system is capable of monitoring fighter planes 
within a fixed radius of the AWR Siabu region. Air Force 
KADISPEN [Head of Information Services] Col J. Paryanto told 
reporters recently that the ACMR is able to monitor aircraft 
movements within a radius of about 100 miles. In addition, the 
ACMR is also able to monitor interception and firing movements 
carried out by the plane and at the same time give the fighter 
pilot guidance, instructions or corrections from the display 
room. 
  The ACMR is also able to record all of fighting maneuvers in 
the air, which allows the collection of more concrete and 
accurate material for discussion by the fighter pilots. It is 
said that these two air-borne capabilities will have a positive 
effect on reducing the cost of firing training. 
  It is well known that the ACMR used by Indonesia and 
Singapore has more reliable monitoring capabilities than the 
ACMR used by the United States, Japan, Korea and Thailand, which 
are only able to monitor the movements of planes in positions 
which have already been determined.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Culprit Caught Red-handed" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- 70 kg of unregistered 
plutonium in pure powder was discovered recently at a reactor of 
the Tokai nuclear fuel plant of Japan. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this case as 
a 
product of conspiracy among Japan, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] which had carried out its inspection and 
the United States which had manipulated the IAEA. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The hiding of plutonium by Japan shows there is a grave 
problem in IAEA inspections and nuclear non-proliferation. 
  The hypocrisy of Japan, a double-dealer, has been stripped 
naked and its wild ambition to become a nuclear power exposed as 
a stark fact. 
  It has been proved that the Japanese Government's persistent 
pressure on the DPRK over the "nuclear issue" was a despicable 
drama to conceal its criminal nuclear arms development. 
  Facts clearly show Japan is a culprit who deliberately 
violated the Non-proliferation Treaty. 
  The plutonium concealment also causes grave doubt as to the 
impartiality of IAEA inspections. 
  The IAEA had said the nuclear facilities of Japan were under 
its strict inspections, but had never reported that there was a 
problem. 
  While closing its eye to Japan concealing a large amount of 
plutonium, the IAEA has faked up "suspicion of nuclear 
programme" of the DPRK and framed every conceivable intrigues to 
have "sanctions" taken at the United Nations organisation. This 
is an act contrary to the basic mission of the IAEA and the 
culmination of its application of a double standard. 
  This eloquently proves that the IAEA is rather used as a 
shameful political tool of the superpower than performing its 
duty and mission. 
  The United States is also involved in the problem. The U.S. 
Government, aware of Japan's concealment of plutonium, has kept 
silence and connived at Japan's nuclear development. 
  It is shameless of the United States to hurl mud at the 
peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK that offer no problem 
and threaten it with the use of arms such as "preemptive strike" 
while keeping mum about Japan's concealment of plutonium, a big 
problem. 
  This shows the United States does not intend to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons but is using the nuclear issue 
for a sinister political purpose. 
  Japan must frankly open to the public the whole amount of 
plutonium it has stockpiled in secrecy and give up the nuclear 
armament programme. 
  The IAEA must observe the principle of impartiality in 
accordance with its mission. 
  The United States must refrain from using the nuclear issue 
for a sinister political purpose against the DPRK and from 
applying the double standard.

<F P=106> ["Reasonable Protest Against Nuclear Criminals" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The protest of the 
inhabitants of Yangsan County, South Kyongsang Province, South 
Korea, against the projected construction of a nuclear waste 
dump is entirely just and can never be incriminated, declares 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  When the county people rose in a powerful struggle against 
the development of nuclear weapons and the construction of the 
nuclear waste dump by the puppet clique on the 12th and 13th of 
May, the puppets ruthlessly cracked down upon the protesters and 
touched off a wave of arrest targeted at those who led the 
protest. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It is the Kim Yong-sam group that must be brought to justice 
in South Korea, the group that has introduced U.S. nuclear 
weapons and, as if it were not enough, is stepping up its own 
criminal nuclear development to impose a nuclear scourge upon 
the nation and is bringing sufferings to the people by dumping 
nuclear waste at random. 
  The puppets, themselves being the criminals, are brutally 
suppressing the people in the anti-nuke struggle. This is a 
shameless and outrageous fascist violence, which reminds us of a 
thief crying "stop thief!". 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique must immediately stop developing 
nuclear weapons and dumping nuclear waste and step down as 
demanded by the people.

<F P=106> ["CPRF Denounces War Exercises of U.S. and S. Korean </F>
Puppets" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
issued an information on Friday denouncing the U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets for frequently staging reckless 
military exercises and committing provocations against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Entering May, the South Korean puppets have staged 
large-scale manoeuvres socalled "combined tactical exercises for 
the first half of the year" involving the three services in an 
area near the military demarcation line (MDL). They have also 
reinforced Armed Forces and fired bullets and shells there, 
perpetrating military provocations almost every day. 
  The information bitterly denounces these moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets as an intolerable 
crime challenging pointblank the desire and efforts of the 
Korean nation to avert the danger of a nuclear war and open a 
new phase of the peace and peaceful reunification of the country. 
  It says: 
  The South Korean bellicose elements made public a war plan 
against the North they had worked out together with the United 
States, and have massively introduced latest-type combat 
equipment from the U.S. they have also massed the puppet Armed 
Forces in areas near the MDL and committed military 
provocations, threatening "a tough counteraction" and 
"retaliation" against the North. This indicates that their 
belligerent moves have reached a very dangerous stage. 
  We want peace. But we are not afraid of war. The U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets had better act with 
discretion, clearly mindful that if they dare ignite another 
war, they would have to pay dearly for it.

<F P=106> ["Foolish Moves Inviting Disaster" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the secret nuclear agreement signed by Nixon and 
Sato on November 21, 1969. 
  With the agreement disclosed recently, the false and 
deceptive nature of Japan's "three non-nuclear principles" has 
been dragged into the light of day, the analyst says, and 
continues: 
  One year after Japan adopted "the three non-nuclear 
principles" it allowed the introduction into and passage through 
Japan of U.S. nuclear weapons. 
  It is to convert Japan into a nuclear power with the 
connivance and cooperation of the United States that the 
Japanese ruling circles have left Japan as a nuclear base of the 
United States. 
  Today Japan is accelerating nuclear armament behind the 
curtain of "the three non-nuclear principles." This is not 
merely suspicion. It has reached a danger line in actuality. 
  As the recently exposed concealment of plutonium at the 
Tokai 
nuclear fuel factory shows, Japan has stepped up nuclear 
armament, keeping a large quantity of plutonium in concealment. 
  Japan can turn into a nuclear power any moment. 
  Japan, however, is now charging the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea with "the nuclear issue." This reminds us of a 
thief afraid of his own shadow and shows Japan's shamelessness. 
  It is a mockery of the Japanese people and the international 
community for the Japanese reactionaries to advertise the "three 
non-nuclear principles." 
  The Japanese reactionaries had better act with discretion, 
clearly mindful that such acts of theirs as leaving the Japanese 
territory as a nuclear base of the United States and pushing 
ahead with the nuclear armament are foolish acts which will 
result in bringing a nuclear disaster to Japan again.

<F P=106> ["Just Overture for Durable Peace on Korean Peninsula" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
describes the DPRK's proposal for replacing the Armistice 
Agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a new peace 
arrangement as a timely and realistic measure to settle the 
nuclear and other acute issues on the Korean peninsula and open 
a new phase in the improvement of DPRK-USA relations and 
inter-Korean relations. 
  The paper says in a by-lined article: 
  To remove military confrontation and the danger of war and 
preserve peace on the Korean peninsula is a vital question 
related to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the future 
destiny of the Korean people and a main key to the preservation 
of peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. 
  Due to the reckless illegalities of the United States, a 
signatory to the Armistice Agreement, military confrontation 
remains and the danger of a new war is increasing on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The United States is trying its hardest to stifle the DPRK 
with strength over its "nuclear issue" while wantonly violating 
the Armistice Agreement. 
  The DPRK and the United States are signatories to the 
Armistice Agreement. Therefore, hostile relations between them 
cannot be removed nor can rapprochement be achieved without 
replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and 
establishing a new peace arrangement. 
  A glance at the existing truce arrangement justifies an 
early 
realization of the DPRK's peace overture. The present truce 
arrangement is a legal and institutional mechanism to check arms 
buildup and military confrontation, stabilise the situation and 
preserve peace on the Korean peninsula. But it fails to play 
its role as such today. 
  After the collapse of the East-West cold war structure and 
the equilibrium of strength, the United States, acting the "only 
superpower," is shipping large quantities of military equipment 
to South Korea in broad daylight and becoming more undisguised 
in its military threat to the DPRK, a signatory to the 
Armistice Agreement, in an effort to stifle it. This means that 
the United States has unilaterally and totally abrogated the 
Korean Armistice Agreement it signed in the name of the United 
Nations, and nullified the provisions of the agreement. 
  The United States must discard the anachronistic 
confrontation concept and war psychology and accede to the 
DPRK-proposed negotiations for peace.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Nuclear Ambition Dragged Into the Open" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the recent discovery of 70 kilograms of pure 
plutonium enough for the manufacture of nine nuclear bombs at 
reactors of the fissionable material producing processes in the 
Tokaimura Atomic Industrial Centre, Japan. 
  The analyst says: 
  Japan has never let a chance pass by without saying the 
production and stockpile of a large quantity of plutonium in the 
country were for "a peaceful purpose" and it would not lead to 
the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. It has also 
boastfully claimed that it is "a model" in accepting inspections 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was fully 
revealed this time that all this was a lie. 
  The analyst continues: 
  Pretending to open to the public the amount of stockpiled 
plutonium, Japan has concealed a part of it. This proves that 
it has invariably stepped up the design to turn itself into a 
nuclear power under the cloak of "a peaceful purpose." 
  Broad public circles of the world have considered that 
Japan's stockpile of plutonium more than necessary is related to 
its design to become a nuclear power. 
  The Japanese authorities are now clamouring about 
"investigation" and "removal of misgivings." This is, however, a 
belated excuse. 
  Japan's nuclear design remains unchanged. It is racing 
headlong toward nuclear armament. 
  Its nuclear armament poses a serious threat to the peace and 
security in Asia and the rest of the world.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Japan's Aggressive Design" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Foolish is the design of 
the Japanese authorities to dominate Korea and the rest of Asia 
again, declares NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article Sunday. 
  Noting that the Japanese ruling circles are now making haste 
with the preparations for "security emergency legislation 
arrangements," the article says: 
  "The security emergency legislation arrangements" mean the 
enactment of a wartime law which would allow Japan to take part 
in the war immediately after the United States started it in 
Korea. 
  This is a dangerous move to lay a legal foundation for 
overseas aggression and, on this basis, stage a military 
comeback to Korea. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are scheming reinvasion of Korea, 
availing themselves of the tension mounting on the Korean 
peninsula due to the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK. They are 
now crying for "the security of Japan," while spreading the 
rumor that a war will be started by the North in Korea in no 
time. This is aimed at drumming up support from the Japanese 
people for the enactment of the wartime law. 
  Their intention to enact the wartime law is related to their 
dominationist, aggressive design not only on Korea but also on 
the rest of Asia. 
  They seek to dispatch their aggression forces to Korea and 
any other regions of Asia under the pretext of "emergency" by 
formulating the law. 
  Though dozens of years have passed since the end of World 
War 
II, the Japanese reactionaries have not yet honestly reflected 
on their past crimes and apologized for them, because they 
remain captive to the ambition to dominate Korea and other Asian 
nations again. 
  If Japan choose aggression and war again, failing to draw a 
lesson from their defeat in the past, it would suffer a more 
miserable defeat.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published 
a letter on May 9 exposing the truth behind the fast breeder 
reactor "Monju" of Japan, a Seoul-based radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  It said: 
  What Japan seeks in its nuclear design is not to merely join 
"the nuclear group" but become a nuclear power. The way of 
achieving this goal is to develop destructive devices in secrecy 
and, at the same time, produce and stockpile large quantities of 
fissionable materials behind the "non-nuclear" curtain. Japan 
sees the decisive key to the fulfilment of its nuclear design in 
importing large quantities of plutonium and developing a fast 
breeder reactor which can breed the imported plutonium. 
  The Japanese authorities started the development of the 
prototype reactor "Monju" with the investment of 600 billion 
yen in 1985 and began charging "Monju" with plutonium as its 
nuclear fuel in June, 1992, and finally put it into full-dress 
operation on April 5 this year, despite repeated accidents. 
  Not content with this, Japan plans to enter "the age of a 
full- scale fast breeder reactor" by developing a conventional 
reactor through the stage of a demonstration reactor. 
  As for the fast breeder reactor whose development the 
Japanese authorities are hastening, it has been scrapped in most 
countries because its safety and economic advantage have not 
been guaranteed in the world. Worse still, "Monju" is a time 
bomb fatally fraught with three factors of dangerous accidents. 
  Japan has already developed a destructive device which can 
explode in a one-ten millionth of a second and then started the 
development of a super-high speed destructive device which can 
explode in a one-one hundred millionth of a second long ago. 
  So, the operation of "Monju" which can breed plutonium 1.3 
times the amount of the charged materials means a leap in the 
conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. 
  Japan's development of the fast breeder reactor and its 
surfacing as a nuclear power which pose a great nuclear threat 
to Asia and the rest of the world can never be allowed, the 
letter said, and continued: 
  The Japanese ruling quarters must draw a lesson from 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the nuclear victims, renounce the 
design to become a nuclear power, stop the operation of "Monju" 
and promptly give up the mass production and stockpile of 
plutonium. 
  The United States must direct efforts to checking Japan's 
moves to become a nuclear power, feeling fully responsible for 
the fact that it offered to Japan an excuse for nuclear 
armament, groundlessly charging the DPRK with "nuclear arms 
development," and connived at Japan's nuclear development. 
  Hanminjon calls on the governments, political parties and 
organizations of the Asian-Pacific nations and other countries 
of the world hoping for denuclearization and peace and 
international organizations to invigorate the struggle for 
checking Japan's scheme to become a nuclear power.

  [Text] According to the Seoul-based Voice of National 
Salvation, the Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front [SKNDF] on May 10 issued a manifesto on the 
occasion of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular 
uprising, calling on the South Korean people of various strata 
to rise in the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle for independence. 
  We appeal to all the fellow countrymen: 
  Fellow countrymen, 14 years ago, our people suffered a 
terrible disaster in Kwangju owing to the United States. The 
entire city turned into a city of blood, all the streets were 
covered with corpses, and all the streams inside the city were 
running with blood. That was Kwangju in May. 
  So many innocent people were shot dead by the airborne 
special warfare force driven by the United States, were crushed 
to death by their armored vehicles, and stabbed with their 
swords. 
  Even before the disappearance of this grudge, the cursed 
United States is bringing a horrible nuclear holocaust upon our 
people and our nation. 
  Finding fault with the North's nuclear issue in a groundless 
manner, the United States has expanded its nuclear strategic 
commotions step by step. Now, it has even announced a blunt 
plan for a war of northward aggression and is staging a hectic 
war exercise on the sea and ground, and in the air with the 
introduction of massive war means, like Patriots, and the armed 
forces of aggression close to South Korea and the Korean 
peninsula, driving the situation to a phase of war. This is 
naked expression of the aggressive design of the United States 
which aims to sacrifice our people and nation in a nuclear war 
to realize its strategic goal. 
  Using the South Korean-U.S. cooperative system of countering 
the North's so-called nuclear issue as bait, the United States 
grasped $5 billion and put an end to 6 million South Korean 
farmers' lives by enforcing the opening of rice market. Now, it 
is scheming to make undue profits worth billions of dollars by 
opening South Korea's weapons market while babbling about 
countering the arms buildup of the so-called nuclear threat from 
the North. 
  The United States is running amuck in putting pressure on 
the 
North, even going through the United Nations in a bid to open 
the way out for U.S. war industrial complexes that are facing 
marketing difficulties with the end of the cold war and in order 
to revive the sluggish U.S. economy by turning our country's 
land into a nuclear war theater and by sacrificing our nation in 
a nuclear war. 
  Do you see the evil intention of Wall Street! How can we 
permit this if we are to call ourselves descendents whose hearts 
throb with the blood of the Korean race? It is deplorable and 
heart-breaking to see a nation divided into two to live in such 
a condition for almost half a century without achieving 
reunification. Worse still, why must we endure a nuclear 
holocaust forced upon us by yankees from across the ocean? 
  Was there any time in the long history of our nation that we 
had to experience such a heart-breaking crisis of national 
suffering? Our people can never become an object of 
exploitation, nor can our nation be sacrificed in a nuclear war. 
Now is the time that all the people must rise in a struggle to 
regain national sovereignty. 
  Our nation must determinedly rise in a struggle to get the 
U.S. troops and nuclear weapons fraught with nuclear holocaust 
withdrawn from South Korea and to smash U.S. pressure to open 
the rice and weapons markets. Let us all put an end to the 
colonial rule and intervention of the U.S. imperialists and 
retake the sovereignty of the nation with the nationwide 
anti-U.S. struggle. Smashing the U.S. imperialists' war 
maneuvers and defending the peace on the Korean peninsula are a 
vital question directly linked with our nation's fate. 
  Patriot missiles are not for defense but for a war gamble. 
Let us audaciously carry out a struggle to withdraw the Patriot 
missiles that support a nuclear war. The U.S. arms buildup and 
the Team Spirit exercise are aimed at kindling the flame of war 
on this land. Let all fellow countrymen who love peace and value 
the nation rise in a struggle to deter the U.S. scheme to 
buildup arms, to suspend the Team Spirit exercise, and to smash 
the U.S. imperialists' war maneuvers. 
  Leaving intact the Kim Yong-sam clique which is parasitic on 
the chin of the United States, our people and nation would not 
be able to avoid a calamity. Let us all overthrow Kim Yong-sam, 
the arch traitor to the nation, who has reduced South Korea to a 
colony and a nuclear forward base of the United States and which 
schemes to ignite a nuclear war in this land, and realize the 
sovereignty of the nation. 
  Today's dark situation calls on the popular masses from all 
walks of life to rise in an anti-U.S. struggle. The patriotic 
popular masses of all classes who want to live independently and 
peacefully should spring up to the plaza of anti-U.S. struggle 
for independence so as to defend our nation regardless of 
whether they are the haves or have-nots, whether they are 
atheists or not, or whether they live in Cholla Province or 
Kyongsang Province. 
  With the spirit of the May Uprising, let us all stamp out 
U.S. intervention and domination from this land and open the new 
road for independence, democracy, and reunification in a grand 
anti-U.S. struggle for independence.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- May 15 is the day of 
geological prospecting in Korea. 
  The working people in this domain are significantly greeting 
their holiday with sizable achievements. 
  The state has directed sustained efforts to geological 
prospecting for tapping underground resources for the 
development of the national economy. 
  According to Chu Kil-chun, vice-director of the underground 
resources survey department of the Ministry of Natural Resources 
Development, the deposits tapped last year were 8.7 times the 
plan in coal, 1.5 times in non-ferrous metal and rare metal ores 
and 1.3 times in nonmetallic minerals. 
  Yanggang and Chagang Provinces, northern inland areas of the 
country, discovered abundant gold deposits. 
  Yanggang Province found out a promising coal field, which 
will make it possible to meet the province's demand for coal by 
itself. 
  A coal field of more than 130 million tons was discovered in 
the depths of the existing coal mines in Anju area, South 
Pyongan Province. 
  Meanwhile, prospecting corps have discovered boron, gypsum, 
apatite, silica, zirconium and other underground resources in 
different places.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The United States Is Bringing Dark </F>
Clouds of Nuclear War"] 
  [Text] The U.S. policy of strong power [kangkwon 
chongchaek] to crush our Republic under the pretext of the 
nuclear issue has reached an extreme pitch. 
  The U.S. hardline conservative forces said if we do not 
comprehensively implement the safeguards accord, they would not 
exclude a possibility of taking military steps against us. 
Thus, they are attempting to ignite the fuse of a nuclear war. 
  The U.S. military leaders, whenever they found an 
opportunity, made violent remarks that with a view to blocking 
North Korean nuclear arms development, they would be ready to 
make a venture even for starting a war, that the United States 
would advance along the road of applying pressure on North 
Korea, including taking sanctions, by getting rid of the 
diplomatic method, and that they would not exclude the 
possibility of a preemptive military attack on North Korea. 
  Amid such violent remarks, the U.S. warmongers are 
attempting 
to work out a plot [kyechaegul kkumigo issumnida] to ignite a 
fire hazard for the northward war of aggression--the nuclear 
war--by frequently visiting South Korea. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who flew to South Korea on 19 
April, decided to resume the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise--a nuclear war exercise--in November this year with the 
South Korean puppets, and to take joint military measures in 
order to block the North's so-called nuclear threat. This is a 
practical example of such an attempt by the U.S. warmongers. 
  Today the U.S. armed forces are being constantly reinforced 
around the Korean peninsula. As has already been known, the 
United States brought numerous military equipment, including 
Patriot missiles--mass lethal weapons--together with several 
hundred troops, Stinger missiles, and ultramodern offensive 
helicopters, Apaches, into South Korea. Besides, the United 
States deployed many combat warships including carriers in the 
sea zones close to the Korean peninsula. 
  In addition, the U.S. military authorities are pushing ahead 
with a new aggressive war plan to deploy the U.S. mainland-based 
600,000 aggressive troops including two Marine Corps divisions, 
200-odd warships, and 1,600-odd airplanes on the Korean 
peninsula within 80 days in an emergency. Moreover, the U.S. 
imperialist aggressors are staging northward aggressive aerial 
war exercises each day by mobilizing and deploying numerous 
overseas-based fighter planes and lethal weapons in South Korea. 
They are constantly committing aerial reconnaissance activities 
against the northern half of the Republic. This is indeed an 
alarming military move that can be seen only on the eve of war. 
  By kicking off a row on the pretext of our nuclear issue, 
the 
U.S. imperialists reinforced armed forces on a large-scale, and 
are are straining the situation to an extreme pitch while 
staging various northward aggressive war exercises. This is 
intended to crush [apsal] our nation militarily and gain 
supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Prompted by such intentiions, the U.S. imperialists are 
trying to ignite the fuse of war on the Korean peninsula by all 
means. Because of the reckless U.S. policy of strong power, the 
dark clouds of nuclear war are, in actuality, rushing into the 
Korean peninsula, and the U.S. imperialists' military threat to 
the Asia-Pacific region is increasing furthermore. 
  The prevailing situation demands that the people in the 
Asia-Pacific region resolutely smash the U.S. arms buildup 
maneuvers. The United States must squarely look at the trend of 
the time. It should act with discretion. 
  Those who play with fire are doomed to be burned by the fire 
they ignited. The U.S. imperialists should not ignore the 
demand of our people and the world's progressive people aspiring 
to independence and peace. They must immediately stop arms 
buildup and new war provocation maneuvers. If the U.S. 
imperialists ignite the flames of nuclear war at last defying 
strong protests and denunciation by our people and peaceloving 
people of the world, the rascals will not be able to evade a 
bitter miserable defeat. 
  The U.S. imperialists must be keenly aware of this, and must 
act with discretion.

  The head of the delegation said that the Korean people, who

great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, have made great achievements 
in the building of socialism, which is an encouragement to them. 
  He said the U.S. imperialists are raising a hue and cry over 
the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, but an absolute majority of the 
world's people are not believing it. 
  "We are convinced that whatever plot the imperialists may 
hatch up they cannot block the socialist progress of the Korean 
people who are united in one mind around the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il," 
he added.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Foreign Minister Kim 
Yong-nam sent a message of greetings to the 20th Caricom 
[Caribbean Common Market] conference of foreign ministers. 
  Noting that over the past 20 years, the Caricom conference 
of 
foreign ministers has made a great contribution to further 
strengthening solidarity and cooperation among the Caribbean 
nations and building a Caribbean Community Free, peaceful and 
prospering, the message said: 
  Today the United States and other dominationist forces are 
obstructing the independent development of developing countries 
and small nations. This requires the tightening of the bonds of 
solidarity and cooperation among the Caribbean nations. 
  We express firm solidarity with the efforts of the Caribbean 
countries for countering a new international challenge and 
building an independent and prospering community. 
  As you know, the situation of the Korean peninsula has 
become 
strained due to outcries of the United States and some other 
quarters over "nuclear suspicion." 
  Availing myself of this opportunity, in the belief that you, 
in discussing major international issues, will pay due attention 
to the acute situation of the Korean peninsula, too, I am 
sending the recently published memorandum of the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry in the hope of promoting your understanding of the 
nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula. 
  The message sincerely hopes that the conference will 
successfully discuss all the items on the agenda and score a 
fine fruition.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The first half year plan 
has been fulfilled in different units of the national economy in 
Korea. 
  According to data available, 15 factories and enterprises 
under the Pyongyang municipal general bureau of garment industry 
had carried out their first half year assignments as of April

had carried out daily, ten-day and monthly quotas at above 150 
percent from the beginning of the year, have overfulfilled their 
plans by above 40 percent, while raising the quality of all 
products up to the standard. 
  Several industrial establishments in Kaesong municipality 
including the export fancywork factory, too, carried out their 
first half year plans two months ahead of schedule. Especially,

confectionery factory more than doubled their production 
efficiency by introducing advanced embroidery technique and a 
new plastic machine. 
  Undong and Taeyudong mines have also fulfilled their 
assignments for the first half of the year on all indices and

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets staged provocative joint air war 
exercises against the Northern half of Korea on Thursday [12 
May] and Friday [13 May] in the skies above Oeyon islet, 
Yongwol, Pochon and Chinchon of South Korea, according to 
military sources. 
  Overseas-based flying groups and hundreds of 
fighter-bombers, 
assault planes, observation and reconnaissance planes belonging 
to the U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet Airforce were 
mobilized in the exercises which were aimed at examining the 
capability of surprising strikes at targets in the depth of the 
Northern half of Korea under condition of electronic jamming and 
feasibility of unified command of flying groups of different 
types by early warning plane. 
  In another development, the South Korean puppets staged 
exercises of fire support to ground attack and airlifting of 
combat materials in Yonchon and Paju Counties, Kyonggi Province, 
and in Chorwon County, South Korean Kangwon Province and 
exercises of massive dropping of "commandoes", aerial fire 
attack and support for ground attack in the skies above Pochon, 
Yonchon and Chorwon.

  [Text] According to military sources, on 12 May, the U.S. 
imperialists and the puppets conducted a provocative joint 
aerial war exercise in the skies over South Korea aimed at 
invading the North. Prior to this war exercise, fighter 
bombers, pursuit-assault planes, and electronic jamming planes 
took off from U.S. military bases in the Pacific and flew to 
bases of the U.S. Air Force occupying South Korea. 
  This war exercise was conducted in the skies over Oeyon 
Island and Yongwol. Squadrons based in overseas U.S. bases, 
various fighter bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and 
reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force occupying South 
Korea, and those of the puppet Air Force were massively 
mobilized in this exercise. 
  Timed to coincide with this war exercise, KC-135 refueling 
planes took off from overseas U.S. bases, prowled about in the 
skies over Kwangju and Chungju, and refueled fighters which were 
running amok in the war exercise for a war of Northward invasion. 
  That day, approximately 20 500-MD armed helicopters flew to 
areas in Pochon, Yonchon, and Chorwon of Kangwon Province of 
South Korea, which are close to the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ], 
frantically launched midair firepower strikes, and supported 
ground attacks. On the same day, the South Korean puppets 
deployed tanks and large- caliber artillery groups of the puppet 
Armed Forces to Paengnyong-ri and Chuhyon-ri of Paju County, 
Kyonggi Province and, later, moved approximately 300 armed 
bandits to Chungsu-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon 
Province of South Korea. In addition, 105-mm artillery units of 
the puppet Armed Forces took up combat positions in Songok-ri, 
Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province; Sangsa-ri and Kangsan-ri, 
Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea; and Chomwon-ri, 
Paju County, Kyonggi Province and fired approximately 100 rounds 
of cannon to areas close to the DMZ along the Military 
Demarcation Line. 
  The exercise commotions for a war of Northward invasion by 
the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are a 
deliberate provocation maneuver to aggravate the situation on 
the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] According to military sources, on 13 May, the U.S. 
imperialists flew nuclear-loaded F-16 and F-15 fighter bombers, 
pursuit-assault planes, and early warning planes from their 
overseas military bases to the skies over South Korea and 
conducted, with the puppets, an aerial war exercise aimed at 
invading the North. 
  This frantic war exercise was conducted in the skies over 
Pochon, Kimchon, and Yongwol. Various squadrons from the U.S. 
bases in the Pacific and approximately 380 fighter bombers, 
assault planes, and observation planes of the U.S. and puppet 
Air Forces were mobilized massively. 
  An E-3 early warning plane which flew from the Okinawa base, 
prowled about in the skies over Taejon, Umsong, Chechon, and 
Kunwi, and comprehensively commanded the squadrons which were 
mobilized in this provocative exercise for a war of northward 
invasion. 
  This power-reeking war exercise was a game of fire aimed at 
examining the feasibility of an early warning plane's unified 
command over squadrons composed of different types of aircraft. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets brought hundreds 
of 
heavily armed bandits to Mihyon-ri, Yanggu County, Kangwon 
Province of South Korea and deployed armored personnel carrier 
groups to Sojin-ri, Kosong County. On the same day, tens of 
armed helicopters flew to Mt. Yawol north of Majon-ri, Yonchon 
County, Kyonggi Province; Munsan-ri, Paju County; and Chung-ri, 
Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea and 
frantically conducted an exercise aimed at giving firepower 
support to ground attacks and airlifting operational materials. 
  Also, formations of C-130 transports flew to the skies over 
Pochon and Yonchon and massively dropped commandos of the puppet 
armed forces. These commandos frantically conducted an exercise 
aimed at launching surprise strikes against major targets on the 
Northern half of the Republic and inspired an atmosphere of war.

the Federation of the May 18 Kwangju People's Resistance of 
South Korea decided on Friday to bring a lawsuit against Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, chief culprits in the Kwangju massacre,

  [Text] Manila, May 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea proposed 
Monday to form a "special partnership" with the Philippines 
accenting economic cooperation. The Philippines pledged to 
support South Korea's bid for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. 
Security Council in 1996-97 and said it will not seek diplomatic 
normalization with North Korea before resolution of the nuclear 
problem. 
  Seoul, meanwhile, promised to expand its Economic 
Cooperation 
and Development Fund (EDCF) to the Philippines and to improve 
the status of the 8,000 Filipino workers employed illegally in 
South Korea. 
  Starting the first working day of his Asian tour here, 
visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu made the 
offers in talks with his Filipino counterpart Roberto Romulo, 
Han's aides said. 
  The "special partnership" would be similar to that South 
Korea established with Canada this year, but with Manila the 
goal would be combining Seoul's capital and technology with the 
resources and labor force available here, they said. 
  "The Philippines is the closest country to South Korea in 
the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)," Han told 
reporters Sunday. "We share similar experiences in recent 
political development, specifically in the democratization 
process, and there is much we can offer to the Philippines in 
terms of economic growth experience." 
  "We are thinking of forming a civilian forum between the two 
countries to highlight other areas of exchange, such as culture 
and business," said Han. 
  Bilateral trade is rising steadily and registered 1.25 
billion U.S. dollars last year, with Seoul posting 934 million 
dollars in exports. 
  Filipino soldiers, including President Fidel Ramos, fought 
for the Seoul side during the fratricidal 1950-53 Korean war. 
  Romulo, recalling his country's past cooperation in trying 
to 
defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis, pledged continued 
support, the aides said. He sought better conditions for the 
estimated 8,000 "undocumented" Filipino workers in Korea, 
requesting that they be allowed to stay longer or the quota of 
3,000 who are officially accepted as foreign trainees be 
increased. 
  Han said he will give the issue positive consideration, the 
aides said. 
  On the economic front, Han asked Manila to allow active 
participation by South Korean companies in developing Subic Bay, 
the former U.S. Naval base now being turned mainly into a 
tourist resort. 
  On EDCF, Han gave a favorable reply to the 35 million 
dollars 
worth of projects under review. 
  The South Korean foreign minister arrived in Manila Sunday 
morning, his first stop on an 11-day Asian tour taking him later 
to Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. 
  Han called on President Ramos after his talks with Romulo 
and 
met with opinion leaders to promote private-level exchanges 
between the two countries.

  [Text] Manila, May 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
Philippines will sign a memorandum on defense industry 
cooperation in Manila next week allowing Seoul to sell or donate 
used jet fighters, tanks and artillery, South Korean Embassy 
officials said Monday. 
  Vice Defense Minister Chong Chun-ho will visit Manila from 
May 23-27 and sign the memorandum on May 24 with Filipino 
Undersecretary for Defense Feliciano Gacis, the officials said. 
  The agreement is the first of its kind that Seoul has signed 
with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN). Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, here on the first leg of 
his Southeast Asian tour, proposed that South Korea and the 
Philippines establish a "special partnership" to bolster 
civilian links in the economic and social sectors as well. 
  South Korea already sold 12 naval patrol boats to the 
Philippines in May last year at a cut-rate 100 U.S. dollars 
apiece, paving the way for talks on overall defense industry 
cooperation, the officials said. 
  According to the memorandum, the two countries will form a 
defense industry cooperation committee which will meet once a 
year alternately in each other's capital. 
  Details of the date and place for the upcoming meeting will 
be decided at next week's vice-ministerial talks. 
  The majority of the military equipment that South Korea can 
hand over to the Philippines is of U.S. origin, and Seoul must 
therefore obtain Washington's approval before this materiel can 
be transferred to manila, officials explained. 
  The equipment would include F5-A jet fighters and tanks as 
well as munitions, they said.

  [Text] President Ramos yesterday issued Proclamation No. 
377 disqualifying from the presidential amnesty military and 
police personnel who committed "serious human rights violations, 
including extralegal executions during counterinsurgency 
operations." 
  Earlier, the president issued Proclamation 347 and 348 
ushering in the second round of amnesty to be granted under his 
regime. These proclamations are currently pending Congressional 
seal of approval even as government negotiations with rebels are 
on-going. 
  Under the new proclamation, the grant of amnesty to 
personnel 
of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine 
National Police (PNP) is preconditioned on the fact that their 
acts do not constitute "serious human rights violations" such as 
acts of rape, torture, extralegal execution, arson, massacre, 
other crimes against chastity or robbery of any form. 
  The proclamation amends Section 1 of Proclamation 348 which 
grants amnesty to certain AFP of PNP personnel "who have 
committed certain acts or omissions punishable under the Revised 
Penal Code, the Articles of War, or other Special Laws in 
furtherance of, incident to or in connection with 
counter-insurgency operations." 
  Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon backed 
yesterday 
the Philippine National Police's continued detention of Wilma 
Tiamzon, secretary general of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines, despite the Bulacan provincial fiscal's dismissal 
of the illegal possession of firearms charge against her. 
  Mr. Drilon said Ms. Tiamzon is still facing a kidnapping and 
serious illegal detention case pending before a Quezon province 
court, noting that the kidnapping charge is a non-bailable 
offense. He also said the PNP has appealed to the justice 
department on the Bulacan fiscal's dismissal of the illegal gun 
possession charge against the communist leader. 
  "We are going to follow judicial processes," Mr. Drilon 
said, 
as he suggested Ms. Tiamzon apply for bail if she wants to be 
released from detention. 
  He also said the communist leader can apply for provisional 
liberty before the Presidential Committee (PC) on the grant of 
bail, pardon and clemency. The PC serves as the forerunner of 
the National Amnesty Commission pending the latter's formation. 
  The PC handles the applications for bail or pardon of those 
who are either charged or convicted of non-bailable offenses 
like kidnapping. 
  The Justice Secretary also said if Ms. Tiamzon wants to be 
released for humanitarian reasons, a recommendation for such 
should come from the PNP. 
  As to government's pronouncement that it will continue to 
make arrests while there is still no substantial progress in the 
peace negotiations with leftist rebels, Mr. Drilon said the law 
has not been "suspended" and that police agencies must "continue 
to enforce the law." 
  Mr. Ramos downplayed news that the National Democratic Front 
(NDF) would back out of the peace talks because of Ms. Tiamzon's 
continued detention, stating "so what's new?" during his weekly 
press conference. "We have bent over backwards to make sure 
that every opportunity to dialogue with government is given to 
them," he said. 
  The President added that despite threats to withdraw from 
the 
talks, "the door is still open." 
  In another development, the Department of Interior and Local 
Government (DILG) yesterday reported that 21,106 rebel returnees 
availed of P [Philippine pesos] 670 million worth of financial 
assistance from the National Reconciliation and Development 
Program (NRDP) from 1989 to 1992. 
  This came amidst reports that the funds released by the 
NRDP, 
now known as the National Program for Unification and 
Development Council (NPUDC), were meant as amnesty fund alone. 
  NPUDC executive director Alberto Bernardo pointed out "the 
reported P670 million is not an amnesty fund alone but an 
umbrella fund which covers the various activities of the NRDP." 
  The activities include, among others, the immediate 
assistance project, livelihood loan assistance, balik-baril 
[return gun] project, livelihood skills training and bayanihan 
[mutual aid] resettlement community project. 
  Mr. Bernardo further said the NRDP did not incur expenses 
for 
amnesty applications "as these were shouldered by the local 
government units, DILG, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces 
of the Philippines and Philippine Information Agency." 
  The NPUDC chief added that the NRDP, in coordination with 
the 
Department of National Defense, documented 36 cases of forgery 
in 1992 and 1993 resulting in savings of P68.8 million. 
  In this connection, six fake rebel groups were arrested by 
the PNP Criminal Investigation Service Command and four forged 
checks amounting to almost P130,000.00 were recovered by the 
NRDP.

  [Text] The mainstream Communist Party of the Philippines 
[CPP] identified with Jose Ma. Sison has meted death sentence to 
four breakaway rebel leaders, according to Carlos Forte, head of 
the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee, one of the breakaway 
groups of the CPP. 
  This, however, could not be verified from the Sison-led CPP 
itself. One of its allied organizations, the Revolutionary 
Council of Trade Unions, had earlier denied there was such a 
"hit list" of former comrades to be liquidated but "only charges 
that has to be duly processed in the revolutionary court." 
  In a statement faxed to the CHRONICLE, Forte said Sison's 
politburo has convened itself as a "People's Court" and voted 
5-4 to liquidate Filemon Lagman, Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, 
and Ricardo Reyes. Forte is reportedly the nom de guerre of 
Lagman. 
  "We have identified three of the comrades assigned to carry 
out this order, one of whom is a long-time operative of the 
defunct Armed City Partisan (ACP) in Metro Manila of the early

  [Text] The National Economic and Development Authority 
(NEDA) revealed today that the safeguarding of the environment 
is now ensured with the approval by President Ramos of the 
Philippine Program for Biodiversity Management. 
  This program will prevent the depletion of the country's 
natural resources in the pursuit of industrialization as 
envisioned under Philippines 2000. 
  The approval of the program was made during the recent 
meeting of the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development 
(PCSD) with the president. 
  Officially called the Philippine Strategy for Biological 
Diversity Conservation (PSBDC), the program contains 18 broad 
objectives intended to address issues such as biodiversity 
policy, sustainable use, sustainable agriculture, recognition of 
ancestral domain, public education and awareness on 
biodiversity, and institutional capability-building. 
  The specific goals of the PSBDC include: developing and 
implementing a holistic and comprehensive national program for 
the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use 
of its components; ensuring that the relevant activities of the 
biodiversity program harmonize with those of other government 
and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), private sector, 
religious groups, and local community; and institutionalizing 
the practice of biodiversity conservation through legislative, 
administrative, fiscal and other regulatory measures. 
  An important issue the program addresses is the need for a 
review of existing national and local policies on the 
management, use, and conservation of natural resources areas, 
wildlife and other biological resources. 
  The program thus aims to reform those policies that 
encourage 
the misuse of natural resources and ecologically unsound 
management of biodiversity and its components. 
  It also proposes that policies which give incentives to 
industries that practice sustainable development and 
environmentally sound activities be adopted. These would 
include reduction of resource consumption through waste 
minimization, recycling, and conservation. 
  Another objective of the PSBDC is the implementation of 
natural resources accounting method that promotes biodiversity 
conservation. Part of this objective is the development of 
satellite environmental accounts in the Philippine system of 
national accounts. 
  This could lead to the appropriate pricing of resource 
ecosystems. Today, resource ecosystems are being treated as 
"free" good and their degradation does not count as depreciation 
of the nation's basic capital stock in the calculation of Gross 
National Product (GNP). 
  Another critical objective of the program is the integration 
of biodiversity conservation into national and local development 
planning. 
  "If government agencies, both national and local, are 
willing 
to incorporate biological diversity conservation in the planning 
and management of the country, positive changes in the 
ecological, economic and social spheres of development will 
surely come about," the program states.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign 
Ministry Saturday called North Korea's discharge of fuel rods at 
its 5-megawatt reactor "extremely regrettable" and voiced hope 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be able to 
clarify the situation. 
  "It's extremely regrettable that North Korea gave 
notification it will unilaterally begin changing the fuel rods 
at its 5mw experimental reactor," said ministry spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho in a commentary. 
  The spokesman supported the IAEA's dispatch of an inspection 
team to North Korea. 
  "The Government of South Korea emphasizes to North Korea the 
importance of sampling and securing the rods as demanded by the 
IAEA and reminds it that the nuclear problem should not be taken 
to a destructive stage by North Korea's unilateral changing of 
the fuel rods," he said. 
  "The Government of South Korea urges North Korea to soon 
engage in negotiations with the IAEA on the replacement of the 
rods at the nuclear reactor and to carry out its full 
obligations."

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Chances are high that the 
United States and North Korea will meet in a third round of 
high-level talks, though North Korea has started refueling at a 
5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, a ranking government 
official said this weekend. 
  The official, noting the new U.S.-North Korea meeting is 
related to the regular and additional inspections of North 
Korea's nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) as requested in the U.N. Security Council 
president's recent statement on North Korea, said if the IAEA 
inspectors arriving in North Korea Tuesday [17 May] conduct 
inspections as scheduled, a third round of high-level U.S.-North 
Korea talks are highly likely to be held. 
  Seoul and Washington reportedly interpret Pyongyang's start 
of refueling at the 5-mw reactor not as the start of fuel rod 
replacement but as the start of preparations for fuel rod 
replacement. 
  Fuel rod replacement requires at least 15 days of reactor 
cooling. 
  If North Korea is found to have started replacing fuel rods 
during the coming IAEA inspection, the United States would not 
hold the third round of high-level talks with North Korea, the 
official said. 
  Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation said U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs 
Robert Gallucci had told Chairman Kim Tae-chung that the third 
round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would be held in 
weeks during their meeting in Washington on Wednesday. 
  When Kim stressed the need for a package-deal approach to 
the 
North Korean nuclear issue, Gallucci expressed his approval, the 
foundation added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- As the chances increase 
that Washington and Pyongyang will meet again late this month to 
discuss the latter's nuclear program, Seoul reaffirmed Friday 
that the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks should 
be held in parallel with inter-Korean dialogue. 
  Future North-South dialogue should take the shape of either 
a 
Joint Nuclear Control Committee meeting or a high-level 
inter-Korean meeting to discuss problems related to implementing 
the joint declaration of denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  These are among the items agreed at a high-level unification 
and security policy meeting presided over by Deputy Prime 
Minister and Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday morning. 
  It was also agreed to revise the North Korean defectors 
protection law to help Northerners, including those fleeing from 
Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia, resettle in South Korea. 
  Through his Spokesman Kim Hyong-ki, Deputy Premier Yi said 
the nuclear dispute has become "delicate and subtle" and that 
the government would continue pursuing a quiet approach to the 
issue of North Korean loggers, without embarassing "the third 
country." 
  Attending the meeting were Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Director Kim Tok of the Agency 
for National Security Planning, Chief Presidential Secretary Pak 
Kwan-yong and Senior Presidential Security Secretary Chong 
Chong-uk.

  [Text] The government believes that even though North Korea 
said it had begun changing fuel rods at the five-megawatt 
nuclear reactor, the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks 
would be held. Accordingly, it has been holding in-depth 
discussions with the United States regarding the issue. 
  The government's view is based on the fact that the 
replacement of fuel rods by North Korea has not yet reached the 
point in which the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] 
call for the selection and preservation of some fuel rods would 
not be met. Therefore, the ROK and U.S. Governments agree on the 
holding of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks when IAEA 
inspectors -- who are scheduled to visit North Korea on 17 May 
-- satisfactorily complete their additional inspections or 
follow-up [husok] inspections. 
  The government has decided, however, to urge North Korea 
through many channels, including North Korea-U.S. working-level 
contacts and China, not to carry out the work of replacing fuel 
rods any further. 
  A high-level government official said on 14 May that 
"although North Korea said it had begun replacing fuel rods at 
its nuclear reactor, it is not sure to what extent it has done 
so."

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- There will be no next 
North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue if Pyongyang is found to 
have crossed "the line" in unloading from its nuclear reactor, a 
high-level Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. 
  This "line" is crossed if North Korea conducted any activity 
with the nuclear fuel rods that makes it impossible for the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to randomly select and 
secure them for measurements later, this official said on 
condition of anonymity. 
  He suggested, however, that the immediate worry over North 
Korea's nuclear program is separate from this rod unloading 
process. 
  "We have to remember that the most important thing right now 
is preventing North Korea from taking the rods out, using them 
for reprocessing to make materials that can be used for making 
weapons," he said. But the point in securing and measuring the 
rods is in tracing back the history and thus is separate from 
preventing nuclear weapons program, he said. 
  Pyongyang notified the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) Friday that it began the rod discharging process, no 
longer able to defer it for technical reasons. 
  Seoul, Washington, and the IAEA had repeatedly said 
unloading 
of the rods without monitoring by the agency means an end to 
dialogue on the nuclear row. 
  The official was optimistic that Pyongyang hasn't yet 
crossed 
the line since it has told the IAEA there is still an 
opportunity for the agency to select and secure the rods. 
  "If North Korea had already passed the line, this would be 
impossible," said the official. If the line has been crossed, 
there will be no next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level 
dialogue, this official emphasized. 
  There will be no high-level dialogue while the IAEA 
inspection team is in Pyongyang next week, despite North Korea's 
demand that the they discuss the rod unloading agenda at the 
high-level meeting, he said.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in 15 May Seoul vernacular newspapers on 
North Korea starting to replace the fuel rods at its five 
megawatt-class atomic reactor without the presence of 
International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, inspectors. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word 
article by Pak Tu-sik on the true intention behind North Korea 
replacing the fuel rods. The article begins: The ROK, the 
United States, the IAEA, and Western countries agree that if 
"North Korea replaces the fuel rods without the presence of the 
IAEA," it will lead to a "catastrophe." Citing that such a 
decision by North Korea is a "reckless plot" to further their 
own interest, the article stresses that "no decision can be 
made" until the IAEA inspection team makes a "report" on the 
result of its inspection. After noting that North Korea's 
decision to replace the fuel rods is a way to hold the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the article points out the replacement 
work may only be in its preparatory stage and that the actual 
replacement of the fuel rods has not begun. The article 
concludes that the judgment of the IAEA inspection team will 
determine if North Korea has actually started replacing the fuel 
rods at its atomic reactor. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 3 publishes a 900-word 
article by Nam Chan-sun in Washington on the true intention of 
North Korea's decision to replace the fuel rods of its atomic 
reactor without the presence of the IAEA inspection team. The 
article gives four reasons for such a decision: First, North 
Korea publicized its decision to replace the fuel rods in order 
to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date. 
Second, there is a high possibility that North Korea is using 
the fact that the IAEA inspection team, which will leave for 
North Korea on 15 May, will inspect the five megawatt-class 
atomic reactor anyway. Third, the decision is aimed at 
obtaining publicity from home and abroad of its position by 
rejecting the claims by the United States and the IAEA that the 
replacement of the fuel rods must not be carried out without the 
presence of the IAEA. Fourth, there is a possibility that it 
was necessary to replace the fuel rods to maintain the safety of 
North Korea's facilities and meet technological demands, as 
North Korea claims. The article concludes by reporting that no 
decision can be made until the IAEA inspection team concludes 
its inspection. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 
800-word 
editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Bringing 
About UN Sanctions." The editorial notes that it seems that the 
United States and the ROK have been "dragged along by North 
Korea's nuclear strategy." Noting that North Korea has a habit 
of unilaterally severing and then resuming negotiations at the 
last moment, its decision to replace the fuel rods is intended 
to "drive a wedge" in holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks. Citing that North Korea is trying to settle for a 
package deal of "improving relations with the United States, 
obtain support for its light-water reactor, achieve economic 
cooperation, and conclude a peace agreement on the Korean 
peninsula," the editorial notes that since North Korea's true 
intention has now become clear, "the United States must take a 
more resolute measure" regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. 
The editorial reports that if North Korea does not stop the 
replacement of the fuel rods and does not receive IAEA 
inspections, this will only lead to sanctions by the UN Security 
Council. The editorial repeatedly urges that as a responsible 
member of the international society, North Korea must work to 
resolve the nuclear issue peacefully. 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 1,200-word article 
by 
Yi Chong-yon in Washington on North Korea's unilateral 
notification that it has started the replacement of the fuel 
rods at its atomic reactor. The article reports that diplomatic 
sources in Washington analyze that North Korea's decision to 
replace the fuel rods is a "strategic card to realize the 
DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date." The article reports that 
diplomatic sources feel it is very unlikely that North Korea 
replaced the fuel rods, but has only started safety inspections 
for replacement. The article continues that the United States 
will decide what to do after obtaining results by the IAEA 
inspection team. The article concludes that it will be decided 
to present the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council after 
the IAEA carries out its inspection next week. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word 
article by Kim Cha-su entitled "The Government's Reaction to the 
Replacement of Fuel Rods by North Korea." Referring to the 
government's embarrassment regarding North Korea's 14 May 
announcement that it has independently begun changing fuel rods 
at its five megawatt-class nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, the 
article writes: "This is because the government has so far 
adhered to the strong position that it will resume the 
discussions on sanctions against North Korea if it begins 
changing fuel rods at the nuclear reactor without IAEA 
supervision." 
  Noting the government's analysis of North Korea's public 
announcement that it has begun changing fuel rods, the article 
reports that the government will formulate concrete plans to 
deal with North Korea after IAEA inspectors complete their 
inspection activities in North Korea. 
  The article reports: "The government stresses that it has no 
other choice but to discuss sanctions against North Korea with 
other countries concerned if the IAEA declares the continuity of 
the nuclear safeguards has been suspended, and that it has 
decided to convey such a position to North Korea through various 
channels," referring to the government's attention to North 
Korea's remarks to the IAEA that the issue of selecting and 
preserving fuel rods can be resolved at the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks. The article continues that the 
government is ready to deal with North Korea, believing that 
this week it will be determined if the North Korean nuclear 
issue is resolved peacefully. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word 
article by Washington-based reporter Chong Hae-yong entitled: 
"Washington's Position on North Korea's Replacement of Fuel 
Rods." Referring to the contents of North Korea's message sent 
to the IAEA on 12 May and analysis by Washington-based sources 
of the background of North Korea's replacement of the fuel rods, 
the article reports that North Korea's announcement to change 
fuel rods is intended to hold negotiations with the IAEA, as 
well as to discuss economic cooperation and establishment of 
diplomatic relations with the United States. 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 700-word article by 
reporter U Tae-chun entitled: "The Present Conditions of an 
Experimental Nuclear Reactor in Yongbyon." The article reports 
that "North Korea has operated an experimental nuclear reactor 
in Yongbyon since 1986." The article concludes: "Western 
experts believe that the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon 
will turn out to be a nuclear reprocessing plant after noting 
its size based on data provided by North Korea to the IAEA and 
the basic reason for the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear 
reactor and the method of extracting plutonium from the spent 
nuclear fuel."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "North Korea's Gambling With Nuclear Fuel Rods"] </F>
  [Text] North Korea has reportedly begun to change fuel 
rods at nuclear reactors without the presence of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team. This 
act pours cold water on an atmosphere in which a new phase of 
dialogue finally became possible as North Korea agreed to 
follow-up inspections, including additional inspections of its 
radiochemical laboratory, which has been an issue for a long 
time. 
  North Korea probably has the hidden aim to baffle its 
counterparts, the IAEA and the United States, by even more 
complicating the nuclear issue to have a favorable negotiating 
position. I am greatly concerned about North Korea's act 
because it is an extremely dangerous gamble that may cause a 
crisis. 
  The international community, including the United States, 
repeatedly warned North Korea that if North Korea proceeded with 
changing the fuel rods on its own, they would suspend dialogue 
with North Korea and apply sanctions through the UN Security 
Council. Accordingly, if North Korea's notification to the IAEA 
that it began changing the fuel rods means a full-pledged 
change, sanctions against North Korea will become inevitable and 
the situation on the Korean peninsula will become more unstable. 
  When North Korea agreed to the additional inspections of the 
radiochemical laboratory and it appeared likely that the IAEA 
inspection team would enter North Korea on 17 May to start its 
inspection activities, we expected a small breakthrough in 
resolving the nuclear issue. 
  Our expectation was based on the view that North Korea would 
postpone changing the fuel rods to seek a solution to the 
nuclear problem at the third round of talks with the United 
States. 
  The contents of North Korea's message to the IAEA leaves 
room 
for negotiations. The message says that North Korea will allow 
the preservation of fuel rods for samples if North Korean-U.S. 
high-level talks result in a package solution to the nuclear 
problem. Also, the position of the IAEA and the United States is 
that they will prepare countermeasures after receiving the 
results of additional and follow-up inspections, which will be 
conducted as planned despite North Korea's notification. 
  The IAEA inspection team plans to carry out additional 
inspections of the radiochemical laboratory in addition to basic 
activities -- such as replacing batteries and film in the 
monitoring camera installed at the experimental reactor, whose 
fuel rods are supposed to be changed this time, and confirming 
the seals of the reactor. U.S. policy is that after receiving 
the results of these inspections, it will decide whether to hold 
the third round of talks with North Korea. 
  North Korea's attempt to change the fuel rods under this 
situation is not a wise decision although it might be a strategy 
to lead negotiations in a direction favorable to North Korea. 
Changing the fuel rods without IAEA taking samples will only 
increase the international community's suspicion that North 
Korea is trying to hide its extraction of nuclear materials. In 
addition, it will make dialogue with the United States, which 
North Korea desires, impossible and will possibly result in 
sanctions against North Korea through the UN Security Council. 
  The international community will hardly put up with North 
Korea's dangerous gamble any longer. North Korea is urged to 
find a way to negotiations while there is the possibility of 
dialogue.

North-South talks in Samchong-tong that the nuclear issue is not 
an easy one because North Korea is using the nuclear issue to 
simultaneously carry out its plan for its regime's survival, as 
well as its policy on South Korea, and that the issue will be 
resolved in a phased manner through well-intentioned pressure 
[sonuiui amnyok]. 
  Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the NUB, stressed in a 
government report that the ultimate goal of the resolution of 
the nuclear issue is to block North Korea from developing 
nuclear weapons and to completely abolish the weapons if North 
Korea came to possess them. He added that along with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection, efforts will be 
exerted for the resumption of South-North dialogue to implement 
the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chae-mok] </F>
  [Text] The remarks by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister 
and minister of the National Unification Board, about the 
"possibility of nullifying the denuclearization declaration" has 
invited a strong reaction from the United States. A ROK 
Government official concerned said on 14 May that as soon as the 
remarks of Deputy Prime Minister Yi had been made public, the 
U.S. Government asked the ROK Government for an explanation and 
has been trying to find out the true intention of his remarks. 
  At a meeting of the Korean Newspaper Editors Association 
held 
on 12 May at the Press Center, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: 
"If it is proven that North Korea has developed even one-half 
of a nuclear weapon, the declaration of the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula would be nullified." 
  The U.S. Government pays attention to the remarks by Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi for two reasons: 
  First, the remarks by Deputy Prime Minister Yi may be an 
attempt to put a brake on the policy of freezing the North 
Korean nuclear program, which the U.S. Government has reportedly 
been examining positively. It is generally believed that the 
U.S. Government has been examining a change of its policy toward 
North Korean nuclear weapons from a policy of preventing North 
Korea from developing nuclear weapons -- a policy based on the 
notion that "North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons cannot 
be allowed absolutely" -- to a policy in which "one or two 
nuclear weapons can be overlooked." 
  In particular, U.S. moderates who espouse the policy of 
freezing the North Korean nuclear program believe that if North 
Korea is urged to remain in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] system and open itself up, North Korea will naturally 
collapse in the near future. 
  Second, the "theory on nuclear sovereignty" that some ROK 
academic and political circles had persistently advocated may, 
the U.S. Government worries, have infiltrated into even the 
government level and that the remarks by the Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi may be a good example of this possibility. 
  This U.S. policy was made clear when it pressured the ROK to 
include the provision that the North and South "shall not 
possess reprocessing facilities and uranium enrichment 
facilities" in the declaration on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, which the North and South agreed on in 1991. 
The U.S. strategy was to prevent not only North Korea, but 
South Korea from developing nuclear weapons. 
  When some ROK people still advocated the "theory on nuclear 
sovereignty," even after the denuclearization declaration was 
effectuated, the U.S. Government examined the possibility of 
making the denuclearization declaration an "international 
treaty" and asked the ROK Government what it thought of the 
idea. The U.S. Government did so because it believed it is 
necessary to seek the signing of a denuclearization treaty to 
overcome the weakness of the denuclearization declaration, which 
can be abrogated by a mere North-South agreement. 
  The U.S. Government pays special attention to the remarks by 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi because it thinks senior ROK Government 
officials have made "suspicious remarks" one after another. In 
early April Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said: "Keeping 
North Korea in the NPT system is the most important factor in 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, and North-South mutual 
inspections are not an urgent priority." The U.S. Government 
expressed its interest in his remarks as well. Even when the 
ROK Government decided not to insist on North-South exchange of 
special envoys, a precondition for the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks, the U.S. Government officially welcomed this 
overture. However, it still suspected that this may be an 
extension of the theory on nuclear sovereignty on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  As the controversy over his remarks escalated, Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi explained he intended to stress that "North Korea 
must not possess nuclear weapons." Nevertheless, the 
speculation that his remarks may have been a message from the 
ROK Government to the United States persists in the United 
States. 
  Therefore, it is predicted the difference in views between 
the United States and the ROK, which was exposed by the remarks 
by Deputy Prime Minister Yi, will be further sharpened when 
North Korea returns to the NPT and when, as a result, the 
deadlock over the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved to a 
certain extent.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan 
agreed to increase bilateral cooperation in nuclear energy 
policy and the International Atomic Energy Agency's plan to 
extend the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in their fourth 
atomic energy cooperation meeting held in Tokyo Thursday and 
Friday, the Foreign Ministry said over the weekend. 
  The two countries, sharing a view that they should increase 
cooperation in promoting the safety, reliability and economics 
of atomic power plants, decided to expand bilateral technical 
information exchange programs in the nuclear energy industry. 
  They also agreed to continue their joint diplomatic efforts 
toward North Korea accepting the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's 
inspections and enhance cooperation in controls on exports of 
nuclear power-related materials and equipment to specific 
countries. 
  Director Choe Yong-chin of the Foreign Ministry's 
International Economic Affairs Bureau headed the Korean 
delegation to the meeting and Akira Hayashi, Japanese Foreign 
Ministry official in charge of arms control and science and 
technology, represented Japan.

  [Text] In an interview with the PUSAN MAEIL SINMUN on its 
founding anniversary on 14 May, President Kim Yong-sam said: "I 
believe that it is not necessary for us to particularly propose 
first the South-North summit talks or the exchange of special 
envoys." Thus, he clearly stated that as long as there is no 
progress in South-North relations, including the resolution of 
the North Korean nuclear issue, he has no intention of proposing 
the summit. During the news conference on the first anniversary 
of his inauguration in February, President Kim had said: "I will 
hold the South-North summit talks if it is necessary to solve 
the nuclear issue." However, when asked why he is expressing a 
different opinion now, he said: "This is because of the 
considerable change in the situation compared with that time." 
He also added: "North Korea ruptured the talks itself when it 
threatened us during the working-level contact for the exchange 
of special envoys in March with the remark of turning the South 
into a `sea of fire.'"

<F P=106> [By Nam Chan-sun from Washington from the "Tidbits" column] </F>
  [Text] In a speech made at the National Press Club in 
Washington on 12 May, Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Board of 
Directors of the Asia and Pacific Peace Federation, suggested 
that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter be sent to North Korea 
as a U.S. special envoy to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
issue. He claimed that it would be very effective in persuading 
North Korean President Kim Il-song. 
  He also said that since President Kim Il-song himself hinted 
that he wants to visit the United States, if President Kim does 
not respond to the invitation by the United States when it is 
made, he will have to be responsible for the consequences it 
will bring about. 
  Kim Tae-chung said that he actively encourages the 
South-North summit between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Kim 
Il-song, and said he has no intention of visiting North Korea 
before the summit takes place. 
  Two-hundred newsmen; his wife Yi Hui-ho; and lawmakers Yu 
In-hak, Han Hwa-kap, and Choe Chae-sung were on hand. Kim 
Tae-chung made the speech and answered reporters questions in 
English. When foreign reporters asked questions, however, he 
asked them to be interpreted into Korean and then responded.

  [Text] The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] criticized a 
speech made by Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Board of Directors 
of the Asia and Pacific Peace Federation, during his visit to 
the United States, suggesting that it is appropriate for 
President Clinton to invite Kim Il-song to visit the United 
States and that the United States should send a special envoy to 
North Korea. He added that this may bring about confusion in our 
reunification and diplomatic policy on the North. 
  Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP policy-making committee, said 
that the remark by Kim Tae-chung was not appropriate because of 
the delicate situation regarding the North Korean nuclear issue 
at this time. He pointed out that this may bring about 
confusion in the policy on North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] is concerned about Asia-Pacific Peace 
Foundation Chairman Kim Tae-chung's proposition that Washington 
send former President Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang as a special 
envoy and invite North Korean President Kim Il-song to visit the 
United States, saying it may get the North Korea policy confused. 
  Chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki said Saturday Kim had made "an 
inappropriate proposal at an inappropriate time," adding that 
the proposal might bring about confusion to the policy toward 
the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  He said he could hardly understand Chairman Kim's proposal 
for a meeting between former U.S. President Carter and North 
Korean President Kim Il-song and expressed concern about Kim's 
true meaning. 
  "It is desirable for the National Unification Board to brief 
opposition politicians on the unification policy so that there 
will be no confusion in North Korea policy," he said. 
  Yi made the remarks during the party's higher-level staff 
meeting on Saturday morning, party spokesman Pak Pom-chin said. 
  Pak also expressed concern about Kim's proposal, saying 
although the proposal is related to international politics, it 
is having influence on domestic politics.

  [Text] The subduing inter-party political bickering over 
former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung's role has been rekindled 
when he stressed the need for a summit meeting between the 
United States and North Korea Thursday. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday came up 
with criticism of Kim's remarks while the main opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) quickly refuted the charges. 
  "Kim made inappropriate remarks at an improper time," said 
DLP chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki in a meeting of party leaders. 
  Kim, chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the 
Asia- Pacific Region, asserted at the National Press Club in 
Washington that President Bill Clinton has to send former 
President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as an envoy and invite 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song to the United States in an 
effort to resolve the North's nuclear issue. 
  "Worries are that the remarks, in the long run, could 
trigger 
chaos in our government's policy toward North Korea," Yi, former 
head of unification policy, noted. 
  Party spokesman Pak Pom-chin saw Kim's comment as 
nonfulfillment of his promise to stay away from political 
affairs for good. 
  "Although Chairman Kim referred to an international 
political 
issue, his remarks are affecting domestic politics," Pak said. 
  Party chief policy coordinator Pak Nam-chi said it doesn't 
make sense to send a famous human rights campaigner (Carter) to 
an inhumane country (North Korea) as an emissary. 
  Another DLP official said he can't but suspect that there is 
a political purpose behind Kim's proposal for the Clinton-Kim 
meeting, given that Chairman Kim knows Kim Il-song has 
"acrophobia." 
  "Chairman Kim should clarify his position on whether he will 
come back to the center stage of politics or will leave the 
political community," the official said. 
  The DLP criticism, however, immediately met with a backlash 
from opposition DP lawmakers, most of whom are followers of Kim, 
the former presidential candidate of the DP. 
  DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said in a statement that Chairman 
Kim's remarks on the nuclear issue have drawn favorable 
responses from international communities as well as from 
domestic media. "But it is regretful that only the DLP has 
responded emotionally and overreacted to the comments," Pak 
said. The spokesman also said unification matters should be 
handled by the government as the DLP has pointed out, but the 
government should guarantee free research activities and 
announcements on the issue by individuals or groups. 
  DP lawmaker Namkung Chin expressed displeasure with what he 
said was the DLP's sensitive reaction, saying that Chairman Kim 
made such a proposal with a true desire to serve the people 
after he inaugurated the foundation for world peace and national 
unification. 
  The inter-party confrontation was sparked amid subduing 
tensions after the DLP dismissed the chief party spokesman last 
week with regard to his criticism of Kim. The former spokesman 
charged that Kim was behind the political deadlock between the 
ruling and opposition parties over the controversial Sangmudae 
political fund scandal, creating an outcry from opposition 
lawmakers.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] demanded Monday that the government clarify 
its position on the North Korean nuclear row as the national 
policy on that issue is being clouded by remarks made by former 
opposition leader Kim Tae-chung in the United States. 
  At a meeting of senior party postholders, presided over by 
Chairman Kim Chong-pil, the ruling party decided to urge the 
National Unification Board (NUB) to issue a clarifying statement 
on Kim Tae-chung's remarks, DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin said. 
  Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, told the 
meeting he could not understand Kim Tae-chung's reasons for 
making remarks that create uneasiness at a time when the entire 
nation is striving to resolve the nuclear dispute. 
  Kim Chong-pil added that Kim Tae-chung's comments cannot be 
understood by the people, Pak said. 
  THE WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Kim Tae-chung as saying Saturday 
that even if North Korea possessed two or three atomic bombs, it 
wouldn't be much of a problem compared with the United States' 
20,000 nuclear warheads. 
  The DLP is expected to make a formal request that the 
government clarify its North Korea policy when the National 
Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee 
meets in plenary session on Thursday. 
  Pak said Kim Tae-chung's remarks, which "sounded like" 
support for North Korea's possession of nuclear bombs, were akin 
to pouring cold water on international efforts to stop Pyongyang 
from developing atomic weapons. 
  More than a few people have doubts about Kim Tae-chung's 
reasons for making comments that are irresponsible and 
unthinkable to South Koreans, Pak said. 
  Meanwhile, the main opposition Democratic Party accused the 
ruling party of taking Kim Tae-chung's remarks out of context 
and distorting them. 
  Deputy spokesman Sol Hun recalled that Kim Tae-chung, the 
Democratic Party's former chairman, has in the past said many 
times that North Korea should not have nuclear weapons under any 
circumstances. 
  Kim Tae-chung's latest comments mean that even if North 
Korea 
possessed two or three nuclear bombs, it could not use them 
against the Western world, which has numerous nuclear arms. Kim 
only wanted to stress that it is foolish for North Korea to 
possess such weapons, he added. 
  Despite that fact, "part of the press has picked up on the 
erroneous report (by the U.S. newspaper) and carried it as 
though it were true," he said. "Then the DLP spokesman turned it 
around and distorted it, saying it was something a South Korean 
couldn't even think of saying, etc." 
  The Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation stated that Kim Tae-chung 
made the remarks in order to stress the foolishness of North 
Korea's developing nuclear arms, as possession of such weapons 
would only bring about self-destruction.

  [Text] The United States recently stated it will exercise 
Super Section 301 because the ROK Government decided to discard 
imported sausages. The ROK Government is saying it will take a 
resolute measure against the unilateral measure by the United 
States. This issue is heightening tension in trade relations 
between the ROK and the United States. 
  In connection with the ROK-U.S. sausage dispute, a Foreign 
Ministry official revealed on 14 May that the United States sent 
a letter to the ROK side reporting that if the ROK does not take 
measures understandable to the U.S. Government it warned: "We 
will take all possible measures." 
  Regarding this kind of warning by the United States, the 
Foreign Ministry said: "If the ROK Government does not take 
appropriate measures, such as compensating those who suffered 
loses, the United States will exercise Super 301, a retaliatory 
measure, against the ROK in September." 
  Chang Ki-ho, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, stated: "The 
government will take resolute measures against the unilateral 
measure by the U.S. side, but at the same time we must gather 
examples from advanced countries regarding foodstuffs to enhance 
the level of our system in this field to the level of advanced 
countries."

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, a 
consortium to build and run the country's second cellular phone 
network, said it had decided to exclude GTE Corp. of the United 
States from its prospective shareholders. 
  The American company has turned down Sinsegi's offer to send 
a letter agreeing to join the consortium as a shareholder. 
  Sinsegi has earlier allotted its foreign stake of 22.2 
percent among four American companies -- 10 percent to ATC, 7 
percent to Southwestern Bell, 4 percent to GTE and 1.2 percent 
to Qualcomm -- and asked them to send a letter of consent by 
Friday. 
  Sinsegi will take action on the 4-percent stake allotted to 
GTE in consultation with its controlling shareholders, Pohang 
Iron and Steel Co. and the Kolon Business Group, a company 
official said.

  [Text] American serviceman Pvt. Kenneth Markle, convicted 
of murdering a Tongduchon bar hostess, will be turned over to 
Korean authorities Tuesday to be put in a Korean prison. 
  The U.S. Forces in Korea notified Friday the Korean 
government of its decision to transfer the 22-year-old soldier 
from West Virginia on Tuesday in accordance with the Status of 
Forces Agreement (SOFA), a spokesman for the Prosecutor 
General's Office said yesterday. 
  Markle, whose sentence of 15 years imprisonment was 
confirmed 
by the Supreme Court on April 29, will serve his term in Chonan 
Juvenile Prison some 100 km south of Seoul. 
  Under SOFA, U.S. Forces authorities can reject Korean 
authorities' request for the transfer of American military 
personnel and their family members who "committed crime," and 
the former can reject it through "sympathetic consideration." 
  But the military authorities are obligated to comply with 
any 
request for the transfer of "convicted criminals." 
  Markle was sentenced last year to life imprisonment in the 
1992 death of the bar hostess, Yun Kum-i, who was then 22, and 
the sentence was reduced to 15 years in jail by an appellate 
court.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (YONHAP) -- Adding to its worries of 
extreme food shortages, North Korea is reportedly having trouble 
importing and exporting industrial goods since Russia banned 
barter trade with the communist country early last month. 
  To make up for their loss in Russia, North Korean trading 
companies run by the defense and public security ministries are 
scurrying about Beijing seeking partners from Japan and 
Southeast Asia as well as South Korea, trading sources based 
here said Friday. 
  Moscow banned barter trade with North Korea on April 1 and 
raised import tariffs more than 30 percent, in effect blocking 
trade with the Stalinist country, a Russian trader said. The 
action was designed to protect Russian companies from incurring 
damages due to slow payment and delays in dealing with North 
Korean smugglers, he said. 
  Many North Korean companies, too, are said to have been 
cheated by bogus Russian traders, another source said. For 
example, a North Korean trading firm lost 3 million U.S. 
dollars while trying to import a truck from Russia last year. 
  The trade friction between North Korea and Russia is 
reflected in Pyongyang's efforts to diversify its trading 
sources, South Korean traders here observed. 
  North Korean traders belonging to defense or security 
agencies have approached South Korean companies in Beijing, they 
said. A trader here said North Koreans were proposing to trade 
almost anything -- from fisheries to antiques -- these days.

  [Text] North Korean loggers, who escaped from a timber 
camp from Siberia, will likely arrive in Seoul in May. 
  A high-level Russian Government official said that "upon the 
strong request from the ROK Government, relevant Russian 
ministries have decided to allow five North Korean loggers who 
currently hold legal residence certificates in Russia out of all 
the loggers who have escaped from timber camps in Siberia, to 
leave Russia for South Korea as soon as possible." 
  The official said that "because Russia has no legal basis to 
prevent foreigners with residence certificates issued by the 
Russian Government from traveling abroad, the Russian 
Government's permission of their trip to South Korea is neither 
a violation of domestic nor international law." 
  A relevant ROK Embassy official in Moscow said that "ROK and 
Russian officials concerned are now discussing whether to allow 
the five loggers to leave Moscow," and predicts that "they will 
arrive in Seoul, though belatedly, later this month."

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- An umbrella organization 
of dissident activist groups announced Monday it will stage 
nationwide rallies Tuesday in memory of the "1980 Kwangju 
popular uprising" against the government. 
  The rallies will start at 7 PM at Chongmyo Park in downtown 
Seoul [four blocks from the U.S. Embassy] and in 11 major cities 
across the nation to mark the 14th anniversary of the civil 
uprising, a spokesman for Chongukyonhap (The National Alliance 
for Democracy and Unification) told a news conference Monday. 
  Local Chongukyonhap chapters will also file criminal 
complaints with prosecution offices in their regions Tuesday 
afternoon demanding the prosecution of Former Presidents Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and others who they claim should assume 
responsibility for the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement, the spokesman said. 
  Additional complaints will be lodged at prosecution offices 
across the country on May 27, when the organization expects to 
have more people joining the move against those responsible for 
the massacre during the suppression, he said. 
  The group hopes more than 1 million people, including 
400,000 
from Kwangju, will join the attempt to take legal action. 
  In a statement, Chongukyonhap said "we are going to file 
complaints with the prosecution against Chon Tu-hwan, then 
commander of the Defense Security Command, No Tae-u, then 
commander of the Capital Garrison Command, and 33 other military 
commanders above the level of battalion commander for treason 
and homicide because we think the incumbent government has no 
will to reveal the truth about the Kwangju democratization 
movement and prosecute those responsible for the suppression of 
the movement." 
  In a separate move, a coalition of the nation's student 
councils plans similar rallies across the nation to commemorate 
the uprising during the "five-day period for struggle to succeed 
the spirits of the Kwangju civil uprising" starting Tuesday, 
with over 1,400 students from more than 10 universities in Seoul 
expected to take part in the rallies in the capital alone. 
  The police, meanwhile, have beefed up security around the 
residences of Former Presidents Chon and No in Yonhi-tong, 
central Seoul, the U.S. Embassy and the presidential office of 
Chongwadae in preparation for possible action there by students. 
Police have stationed more than 2,000 men in and around the 
residences of the former presidents.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hwang Kwang-chol and Hwang Kwang-il, two </F>
brothers who defected to the ROK on 6 May, by unidentified 
reporter--place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [SEOUL SINMUN] How were 
your lives in the coal mine? 
  [Hwang Kwang-chol] Approximately 1,200 were working in the 
coal mine. My life at the coal mine can be characterized by 
hard labor and poverty. We were supposed to work three 
eight-hour shifts. However, in reality, we often did hard labor 
for 12 to 13 hours a day. All we did was pick coal. Members of 
a family are assigned to different pits so that they cannot meet 
during work. They also work different shifts. Therefore, they 
cannot see each other often even at home. We were supplied with 
a pair of working clothes a year. Therefore, I had to wear my 
brother's when mine was being washed. Most coal miners cannot 
bring meals to work. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Then, the efficiency of coal mining must not 
be good, is it not? 
  [Hwang Kwang-chol] Kungsim Coal Mine miners worked in 
inclined shafts 2,400 meters below the surface. Pit props were 
installed every two meters even though they must be installed 
every 70 cm because there are not enough pit props. As a result, 
accidents were common. Electricity was 170 volts and not 220 
volts because of electric power shortages. As a result, 
machines operated at one-third of their capacity. Work 
efficiency plummeted, and a coal miner dug a mere one to 1.2 
tonnes a day, less than his daily assigned goal of 3.5 tonnes. 
When a shaft collapsed in 1991, four coal miners were killed and 
tens of others injured. I lost the use of the small finger of my 
left hand after a blind end collapsed in June 1992. When I was 
working as a blaster, a faulty detonator exploded, and shards 
hit my right eye. Fortunately, I did not lose my eyesight. 
[passage omitted] 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How serious were food shortages? 
  [Hwang Kwang-chol] No food rations had been given for two 
months before I fled North Korea. Even before that, they had 
given us a mere 650 grams a day, after taking out conservation 
rice or patriotic rice (they were sarcastically called coercion 
rice) from our daily ration of 900 grams. Therefore, we had to 
pick wormwood in the fields or go out to catch field mice in the 
fall. 
  [Hwang Kwang-il] I suffered much starvation in North Korea. 
Therefore, while living in China for 11 months after fleeing 
North Korea, I gained 7 cm and 11 kg. Back in North Korea I 
usually gained 5 cm and 3-4 kg a year. It was common to skip 
three to four meals in a row. As a result, 40 to 50 percent of 
children suffered from rickets before entering the people's 
school. [passage omitted] 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] There were rumors that food riots erupted in 
areas close to the border with China. 
  [Hwang Kwang-chol] People in these areas know very well that 
Koreans in China are leading abundant lives. Therefore, when 
food supply is bad, there are often protests and outcries. 
Nevertheless, Public Security Ministry agents carefully contain 
such incidents because they are afraid that if they recklessly 
suppress such disturbances, riots may erupt. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How about other daily necessities? 
  [Hwang Kwang-chol] Only water is abundant. Still, it is 
difficult to get water during rainy seasons because of floating 
cow dung. People brush their teeth with salt because there is no 
tooth paste. There is no toilet paper or paper, so people use 
corn leaves in toilets. I know the supply of soybean paste and 
soy sauce stopped since 1984. [passage omitted]

sisters, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and 
compatriots will unfailingly follow my advice in this message, I

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Ranariddh is the Master Liar </F>
Prince"] 
  [Text] In a radio interview in Phnom Penh on 12 May, liar 
Prince Ranariddh intentionally and shamelessly lied, in the same 
manner that fault-finders and foreign vassals usually do, that 
Democratic Kampuchea has given the Preah Vihear Temple to 
Thailand. 
  Liar prince, your should not tell such an empty lie; even 
the 
children will not believe you. Do not look down upon your own 
people as being so ignorant; they know well that you are very 
notorious. You believe only in the words of the allies and 
communist Vietnamese who are killing the Cambodian nation and 
people and the national resistance forces which are struggling 
for national salvation. 
  The Cambodian nation and people know well that you, the liar 
prince, have resorted to this tale because the allies and 
communist Vietnamese have suffered serious defeats everywhere, 
especially on the Anlung Veng battlefield in February 1994 and 
on Pailin battlefield in April 1994, and are suffering serious 
setbacks on the Route 5 battlefield -- in the areas from Nimit 
to Poipet and from Nimit to Sisophon and so forth. 
  In the same interview, liar Prince Ranariddh further lied 
that the two-headed elements could not control the influx of 
millions of Vietnamese immigrants into Cambodia because the 
Cambodian-Vietnamese border is very long. 
  This statement is really [words indistinct]. This statement 
is in favor of the influx of Vietnamese in order to turn 
Cambodia into another Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian 
territory annexed by Vietnam]. 
  The liar prince has allowed thousands of Vietnamese 
nationals 
to flow into Cambodia every day. They have come by truck, boat, 
and motor boat through big and small rivers and Routes 1, 2, 3, 
and so forth. Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh has thought only of 
attacking his own nation and eliminating the patriotic 
resistance forces. Why? It is because Ranariddh has sold 
himself out to the allies, communist Vietnamese, and Vietnamese 
puppets in exchange for U.S. dollars, gold, jewels, luxurious 
cars and villas, and private airplanes. 
  The Cambodian nation and people condemn and will continue to 
condemn the two puppet groups for betraying the nation and 
people and allowing the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia 
into late Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese Federation.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet, Thailand, May 15 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge 
guerillas have attacked and disabled a bridge on the outskirts 
of the key Cambodian town of Sisophon, a Cambodian government 
officer said here. 
  About 50 Khmer Rouge guerrillas on Saturday blew up a 
section 
of a bridge which connects Sisophon to the town of Mongkol 
Borey, eight kilometers (five miles) east, he said. 
  The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's 
supply route, had been made impassable for large vehicles, 
according to officer with the Cambodian-Thai Coordination Office 
(CTCO). 
  Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from 
the structure and reinforcements had been sent, he said. 
  Mongkol Borey was believed to have been attacked by Khmer 
Rouge forces at the same time, the officer said. 
  Detailed reports from the area were unavailable.

  [Text] A special report from the Battambang-Sisophon 
portion of Route 5: The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK] crushed the invading forces of the two-headed government 
in Mongkolborei, completely liberating the Mongkolborei township 
and bridge. 
  At 0400 near dawn on 15 May the NADK and people attacked the 
invading forces of the two-headed government in Mongkolborei 
township from three directions. The first prong engaged the 
enemy at the Mongkolborei Bridge. The second prong hit their 
position in the Mongkolborei market. The third attacked the 
defense networks protecting the Mongkolborei township along the 
Mongkolborei River south of Route 5. 
  As initial results: 1. We completely destroyed the position 
defending the Mongkolborei Bridge and destroyed the Mongkolborei 
Bridge itself. 
  2. We destroyed the position of the invading forces in the 
Mongkolborei market and completely liberated the market. 
  3. We crushed the invading forces and the brutal authorities 
of the two-headed government along the Mongkolborei River from 
Bat Trang to Rohat Toek. 
  The NADK and people are carrying on the attack against the 
invading forces and brutal authorities of the two-headed 
government both on and along Route 5. 
  The strategic transport line of the invading forces from 
Battambang to Sisophon and from Sisophon to Poipet which for 
months has been intermittently closed is now completely cut off. 
In whole units, the invading troops are fleeing in all 
directions, trying to return to their homes and loved ones, 
especially those who have been forcibly sent by the two-headed 
government from Oddar Meanchey, Siem Reap, and Preah Vihear. 
The brutal authorities are also running for their lives. Those 
who were forcibly drafted have pledged to the people that they 
will no longer serve the leading puppets of the communist 
Vietnamese and the Americans against their own nation and 
people. They said they have seen with their own eyes and heard 
with their own ears that the alliance headed by the United 
States has overtly colluded with the communist Vietnamese and 
their stooges in the two-headed government in trying to do away 
with our nation. Our people both in the countryside and the 
cities as well as those living elsewhere must unite and fight 
most vigorously to defend our nation and race and save it from 
being wiped out by the aggressors, be it the communist 
Vietnamese, the alliance, or their running dogs in the 
two-headed government.

  [Text] A special report from the battlefield of Preah

District, Preah Vihear Province, and the liberation of 15 
satellite hamlets around the district seat: 
  On the morning of 14 May the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] and the people attacked the invading forces of 
the two-headed government in the district seat of Sangkum Thmei 
District, Preah Vihear Province. After fighting from 0500 to 
0900, we completely liberated and controlled the seat of Sangkum 
Thmei District and liberated 15 satellite hamlets around it. 
  The NADK and the people killed 37 invading troops of the 
two-headed government, wounded 59, and captured 15 others. We 
seized 520 assorted weapons, including one DK-82; two 82-mm 
mortars; two 60-mm mortars; one 12.7-mm machine gun; 17 B-40's 
and B-41's; 12 RPK, Kolinov, and RPD machine guns; 223 AK's; 224 
SKS's; and 30 AR-15's along with a large quantity of assorted 
ammunition. We destroyed a large arms and ammunition depot and 
large equipment in three hangars. 
  The freed populace expressed jubilation at being liberated 
from the demonic claws of the invading forces and brutal 
authorities of the two-headed government. They pledged to 
actively participate in the struggle to defend their hamlets and 
contribute to peace and national reconciliation.

  [Excerpt] A Chat Thai Party MP has sponsored an urgent 
motion for the Lower House to debate the Thanong Siriprichaphong 
marijuana smuggling case. 
  Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said the motion was 
submitted by Sisaket MP Chamnong Phothisaro and was accepted for 
the House meeting agenda. 
  Whether the motion would be moved up for debate at the Lower 
House's next meeting would depend on the opinion of the majority 
of the Lower House members, Mr Thawin said. 
  Fellow lawmakers said yesterday that Mr Thanong should know 
what course of action to take because he is the one embroiled in 
the scandal. 
  Phalang Tham Party [PTP] founder Chamlong Simuang said as an 
MP, Mr Thanong should know best what step he should take as a 
result of the scandal. 
  Maj. Gen. Chamlong said, however, that in the interests of 
justice and fairness Mr Thanong's position should also be heard. 
  The PTP de facto leader denied that the United States' 
accusation against Thanong was part of a plan by PTP to ruin 
Chart Thai's chance of joining the coalition. He also said that 
was no reason for PTP to try to discredit Chat Thai. 
  "I believe the people know Khun Thanong's problem. MPs are 
grown-up people and they should set themselves up as models for 
others to obtain the public's trust. We all know what Khun 
Thanong should do," Maj. Gen. Chamlong said. 
  Commenting on the issue, Deputy House Speaker Thawin said he 
believed the Nakhon Phanom MP possessed "political spirit" and 
knows what he should do. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday urged ASEAN 
countries to take a unified stand against foreign interference 
in the Cambodian civil war. 
  "ASEAN is in a good position to voice opposition to any 
foreign interference in Cambodia's internal affairs and to 
oppose foreign (arms) assistance to any of the Cambodian 
parties," he said. 
  King Sihanouk said last week that foreign military 
assistance 
to the Cambodian government might be the only way to end the war 
with the Khmer Rouge. 
  An Australian government official said in Canberra on Friday 
that the Phnom Penh government had approached Australia, the 
United States, France and "some ASEAN countries" for weapons. 
  The six-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) 
comprises Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines 
and Singapore. Thailand has repeatedly warned against outside 
interference in Cambodia's affairs. 
  Chuan reiterated yesterday that his government preferred a 
nonmilitary solution to the conflict. The seemingly endless war 
would only be fuelled further by fresh supplies of weapons, and 
this would have a direct affect on Thailand, he added. 
  However, the prime minister opined it was the Cambodian 
government's "sovereign right to ask for a foreign arms supply". 
  Thailand, smarting under allegations it denies that it still 
supports the Khmer Rouge, has been unsuccessful in previous 
attempts to convince its ASEAN partners of the need for a 
unified stand against foreign interference in Cambodia. 
  Despite well-earned world praise for ASEAN's earlier 
cohesiveness in policies towards Cambodia, a meeting of senior 
officials from the six nations in Thailand last month could not 
reach a consensus on the situation there. 
  Phnom Penh will be invited as a special guest to the annual 
ASEAN meetings to be held in Bangkok in July, when the situation 
in Cambodia will be a topic of concern. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday urged 
France and Indonesia, as co-chairmen of the Paris Peace 
Conference, to call for consultations among all 19 signatories 
to the Paris peace agreement on the question of foreign arms 
supplies. They include the US, France and Australia. 
  "The issue now is that even Western arms suppliers have no 
consensus on whether to supply arms to Cambodia," Surin told 
reporters upon his return from Saudi Arabia.

  [Text] Law enforcement agencies and financial supervisory 
authorities unanimously support money laundering legislation now 
being drafted by a government committee, Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan said yesterday. 
  Amnuai said he had ordered the government panel in charge of 
drawing up new laws, in cooperation with Chulalongkon 
University's Faculty of Law, to study money laundering laws 
already in use in other countries. 
  "We have discussed the matter and all government agencies 
have given their full support," Amnuai said. "I have also 
raised the issue with the Bank of Thailand. There should be no 
problem (in introducing the law)." 
  Amnuai, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB), said he was advised by the anti-drug agency that 
such a law would make it difficult for drug traffickers to 
convert their proceeds into legal currencies and assets. 
  "The measures against money laundering are a good thing. And 
it would not hurt law-abiding citizens either," Amnuai said. "No 
private individual's rights will be compromised." 
  He sought to allay fears expressed by some members of the 
banking community and politicians that a money laundering law 
would turn away foreign investors and shoot down Thailand's 
aspiration to become a financial hub in Southeast Asia. 
  "I don't think a money laundering law, if introduced, would 
affect local or foreign investors. And there is no question 
about whether commercial banks would cooperate with the 
government on the matter. All we need is appropriate guidelines 
and procedures. 
  Amnuai said a money laundering law would require banks to 
report to law enforcement agencies "unusual transactions", 
particularly large cash deposits, by their clients." (The 
anti-money laundering measures) will seek to control and monitor 
cash transactions. No restrictions will be imposed on the 
issuance of personal cheques which can already be monitored." 
  Senate Speaker Michai Ruchuphan, a legal expert, said a 
money 
laundering law was like a "two-edged sword" because although it 
would be useful as an instrument against drug traffickers and 
other organized crime, it would have a wide-ranging effect on 
all members of the public. 
  "The money laundering law would affect everyone of us. The 
law would require everybody -- no matter who he is or what he 
does -- to identify the source of his money," Michai said. 
  He said the government should carefully consider the 
advantages and drawbacks of such legislation before deciding 
whether to enact it. Among possible drawbacks is abuse of 
authority by government officials who have access to people's 
financial records. 
  Earlier this week, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he 
approved of the proposal by anti-drug officials to introduce a 
money laundering law provided that it did not infringe upon the 
freedom of the individual. 
  Also yesterday, John Gieve, president of the Group of 
Seven's 
Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) said 
senior Thai government officials he met during a two-day visit 
Thursday and yesterday had expressed support for the proposed 
introduction of a law to combat money laundering. 
  Gieve, also under-secretary of the United Kingdom's 
Treasury, 
met Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit on Thursday and 
Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday, among other 
senior Thai officials. 
  The FATF was established by the Group of Seven Economic 
Summit in 1989 to develop a multilateral response to the threat 
posed by the growth of international money laundering, 
particularly the laundering of drug trafficking proceeds. The 
body now has 26 member countries. 
  FATF member countries in Asia-Pacific include Japan, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. 
  Dilwyn Griffiths, secretary to the FATF, said although money 
laundering was never an issue in Thailand because the country 
has not made it a criminal offense, there must be some 
laundering activities given the fact that Thailand is a major 
transshipment point for heroin from the Golden Triangle to the 
world market.

<F P=106> ["This report is excerpted from a Bank of Thailand document </F>
presented by Charung Nukhwan, assistant governor of the Bank of 
Thailand to the seminar organized by the Faculty of Law of 
Chulalongkon University in September 1993"] 
  [Excerpts] Money laundering is a process of turning 
illegally- or unscrupulously-earned money into legal currency 
and preventing attempts to prove its illicit origin. Not only 
narcotics traffickers but also criminals have been engaging in 
money laundering activities to purify their money. 
  Money laundering techniques vary from country to country. 
One way to do money laundering is to keep tranferring money 
from one bank or financial institution to another until it is 
difficult to trace the origin of that money. 
  In some cases, the money is first sent to countries where 
laws strictly prohibit financial institutions from revealing the 
identity and personal information of their customers. Later, 
the money will be sent back home. By so doing, authorities will 
find it rather difficult to gather sufficient evidence to take 
any legal action against the owner of the money. 

<H5>    Different Patterns of Money Laundering </H5>
  (1) Illegally-earned money is spent as cash abroad. 
However, carrying a huge amount of cash travelling abroad is 
rather difficult and can trigger official suspicion. Some 
countries impose strict controls on cash transactions while 
financial systems in many countries are not conducive to cash 
transactions. Therefore, cash dealings are practical only in 
countries where regulations are lenient. Cash can also be sent 
out across the borders to other countries with assistance from 
corrupt officials. 
  (2) Depositing the money with financial institutions in the 
country is a common practice. Depositors normally use false 
names in their account books to protect their identities. This 
method is popular in countries where laws do not require the 
disclosure of identities of persons who make transactions or the 
specification of the value of each transaction. This legal 
shortcoming is conducive to using financial institutions to do 
money laundering. 
  (3) Depositing cash with commercial banks and financial 
institutions in other countries where laws on the control of the 
operations of banks and financial institutions are lenient so 
that the money will be included in those countries' monetary 
systems. After that, the money is transferred back to its 
owners, traffickers or criminals, through different means such 
as the wire transfer service. The money is now considered 
clean. This is a weakpoint of the countries which fail to 
enforce the law to strictly control cash outflows. 
  (4) Setting up a business or company is another tactics used 
by traffickers or criminals to conceal the source and ownership 
of their illicit money. They might either set up or purchase a 
company in a tax-free zone abroad. They then have their 
enterprises at home take out a loan or buy goods at exorbitant 
prices from their company in the foreign country so that the 
illegal money can be circulated between the two enterprises. 
  (5) Other methods of money laundering include purchasing 
cash- earning businesses which have been operating at a loss 
such as hotels, foreign exchange ventures, restaurants, retail 
shops, etc. The illicit money then is used to revive these 
businesses. The money is later siphoned out to do something 
else such as buying assignable commercial papers issued by 
financial institutions which assume no responsibility over any 
change of holders of the documents. 
  Moreover, advanced communications technologies in money 
transfer only emphasize quickness. Officials handling the 
transactions have no way of knowing their customers or the 
objectives of the transactions. This is another good 
alternative for money launderers to clean their dirty money. 
  Prevention And Suppression Of Money Laundering In 
Foreign Countries. 
  FATF, Financial Action Task Force is an international 
cooperation program established with U.S. assistance in 1989. 
[passage omitted] 

<H5>    Money Laundering Prevention in Thailand. </H5>
  At present, Thailand is not a member of any international 
organization, nor has it concluded an agreement with any 
countries on money laundering prevention. There is not specific 
law dealing with this problem. Money laundering is not regarded 
as a criminal offense. Financial institutions have no 
particular measures against money laundering except those 
curbing the amount of money in domestic circulation and the 
risks borne by financial institutions in dealing with their 
clients. However, there are several rules and regulations which 
indirectly obstruct money laundering such as the control on cash 
inflow and outflow, the requirement for customers engaging in 
money transaction to reveal their identities, and the retention 
of transaction records. In fact, these are regular pratices of 
commercial banks. 
  Despite the lack of a secrecy law, it is the etiquette of 
financial institutions to keep the identities of their customers 
secret. 
  Suggestions: 
  There are some shortcomings which can obstruct the 
introductioin of a money laundering law. Here are some 
suggestions to overcome the problems. 
  (1) At the initial stage, a law must be promulgated to give 
legal immunity to commercial banks and financial institutions 
which release information about their customers who are 
suspected of doing money laundering. After a period of time, 
commercial banks and financial institutions are required to 
report to the authorities any irregularities, such as the 
transfer of a suspiciously high amount of money so that the 
latter can closely follow it up. 
  (2) Commercial banks and financial institutions must be 
required by law to know their customers in person and be 
prohibited from opening accounts for customers who use fake 
names or refuse to give their real names. Withdrawing or 
depositing huge amounts of cash, for example over 10 million 
baht, would require some written justification, which must be 
keep in the records for a period of time. Suspicious cases must 
be reported to authorities immediately. Commercial banks and 
financial institutions must work out an effective system for 
watching out for and following up any money laundering. 
  (3) A special working unit should be set up to investigate 
monetary offences, confiscate or impound property purchased with 
the money from drug trafficking and other criminal activities, 
and receive information from commercial banks and financial 
institutions for coordination with other agencies concerned. 
This unit can be established independently or under the 
jurisdiction of a ministry. 
  At present, Thailand is in the process of opening its 
financial market and relaxing regulations on the operations of 
financial institutions. New requirements for financial 
institutions in monitoring their customers and reporting to 
authorities can become obstacles to the implementation of the 
said liberal policy. Several countries, such as Singapore, have 
started enforcing this law. Therefore, Thailand can still wait 
to see the result first. 
  Laws and regulations on the control of operation of 
commercial banks and fiancial institutions in Asian countries 
are not much different. The enforcement of the money laundering 
legislation must be carried out step by step to ensure the 
country's maximum interest.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Money Laundering Law Is Needed"] </F>
  [Text] The call for a money laundering prevention law has 
drawn greater attention from the general public following 
following the seizure of the property in the United States of a 
Thai MP who was accused of being involved in marijuana 
trafficking in that country. At present, Thailand has no law 
for the prevention of dirty money laundering, while such a 
legislation has already been enforced in many countries, 
including by our neighbors, such as Singapore. The money 
laundering prevention will enable the authorities to probe into 
the financial status of any suspicious persons to determine the 
sources of their money and related transactions. 
  As a matter of fact, the examination of assets and 
liabilities of suspected individuals is nothing new to Thailand. 
Following the previous coup, the then ruling National 
Peacekeeping Council issued a special order for the examination 
of assets of suspicious politicians. As a result, the people 
were informed of politicians who received gifts of checks and 
individuals who gave such gifts to them. This is another type 
of money laundering law onced enforced in Thailand. But this 
peculiar measure was unacceptable in a democratic society 
because of its discriminatory enforcement. 
  Looked at from another angle, the money laundering law can 
also affect individual rights. However, if too much emphasis is 
placed on personal rights, the whole society can suffer adverse 
consequences. It is imperative that the state place the 
interests of the society over that of individuals. Without this 
law, it is feared that Thailand can become a haven of dirty 
money which is normally earned from narcotics trafficking, the 
contraband goods trade, and other illegal activities. 
  Financial institutions might find it hard to swallow if such 
a law is enforced. Their business and liquidity can be hampered 
should the money of their clients be ordered frozen pending 
official investigation. But they should consider the adverse 
consequences the country has to bear without this law. 
Switzerland was once labelled as one of the places where dirty 
money was deposited. 
  The current situation and present trends in the world and 
society have warranted a money laundering prevention law for 
Thailand. Hence, the authorities will be able to examine the 
money of suspicious individuals. Otherwise, Thailand will 
become a haven of dirty money from law breakers in the country 
as well as from unscrupulous individuals abroad. However, if 
the law makers themselves also have wounds on their backs that 
need covering, it is very likely that such a legislation will 
never be promulgated.

  [Text] National Security Council [NSC] chief Gen Charan 
Kunlawanit strongly opposes any foreign assistance to the 
Cambodian army, and has warned that military aid will only 
prolong the war in Cambodia. 
  An informed government source said Charan made his views 
known during a visit by the Australian secretary for foreign 
affairs about two weeks ago. The source quoted Charan as saying 
that providing arms is not the best way to achieve a lasting 
peace in Cambodia. 
  Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk recently called for foreign 
military aid, saying it was the only way the end the war with 
the Khmer Rouge, and named Australia, France and the United 
States as likely providers. 
  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said yesterday that 
Canberra considered it "wholly legitimate, and consistent with 
the Paris Peace Accords, for the Cambodian government to seek 
such assistance from the international community in order to 
maintain the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity". 
  He said Australia is considering Cambodia's request for 
weapons but will consult and take into account the views of 
other interested countries, including Thailand. 
  Charan also expressed concern that the poorly-paid and ill- 
disciplined Cambodian troops will eventually sell off the 
foreign arms. 
  Sarot Chawanawirat, deputy permanent secretary for foreign 
affairs, said the Cambodian government was entitled to seek 
help, but Thailand believed that providing arms to Cambodia 
would only prolong the fighting there.

  [Text] The Phnom Penh government should end confusion and 
announce which Cambodian factions are officially outlawed, Army 
Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit said yesterday. 
  "An announcement would make it clear who is who in the 
country, as different people have different understandings. 
Some may have incorrect assumptions," Gen Wimon said. 
  He also reiterated his belief that supplying weapons to the 
Cambodian government would only prolong the civil war there and 
warned that Thailand would be seriously affected. 
  The general was responding to reports that Australia and 
United States are considering a request by King Norodom Sihanouk 
for fresh military aid to save his war-ravaged country "from the 
yoke of the Khmer Rouge". 
  Australian officials said last week that Canberra, 
Washington, Paris and some Asian countries were discussing how 
to bolster Phnom Penh's ill-disciplined and poorly-equipped 
military, but no decision had been made. 
  France is co-chairman of the Paris Peace Conference, which 
set up the peace accords. Indonesia is the other chairman. 
  "Thailand would be seriously affected as the weapons 
supplied 
to Cambodia would be put on sale along the Thai border by ill- 
disciplined Cambodian government troops in need of money because 
their pay is so low," Wimon said. 
  He warned that his patience with Cambodia was running out. 
  "Thailand has never intervened in Cambodia's domestic 
affairs 
and will not do so. It is their own business if they want to 
kill one another. But I will not continue to be patient if 
Thais are affected, as I am also Thai. 
  "What Cambodia needs is humanitarian assistance for its 
people, which would help bring lasting peace to the country and 
the region." 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri has also warned that 
providing weapons would only prolong the fighting in Cambodia, 
not bring about a peaceful settlement. 
  Other senior Thai officials are also clearly opposed to any 
military assistance for Phnom Penh's forces. 
  Deputy Defence Minister Maj Gen Sombat Rotphothong and First 
Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said in separate 
interviews that Australia had a right to provide weapons if 
requested by the Cambodian government, but that Canberra should 
consult Thailand before making a decision. 
  "Canberra should ask for Thailand's opinions on the 
provision 
of weapons to Phnom Penh," Sombat said without further 
elaboration. Chettha said consultation was necessary because 
Thailand was Cambodia's immediate neighbour. 
  Gen Wimon said: "If some kind of assistance can bring 
lasting 
peace to Cambodia it would be really appreciated by other 
countries, as a peaceful situation attracts investment." 
  However, if Australia gave military assistance to Cambodia 
it 
would destroy the existing "peace". The peace-building process 
there could not be achieved through military support.

<F P=106> ["Special Report": "Price of Peace in Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] King Sihanouk, disappointed with a lack of progress 
in his attempt to hold dialogue for national reconciliation, 
said in a news conference yesterday that he was sorry that the 
conduct of the leaders of the Cambodian factions was not worthy 
of the $3,000 million the world gave to the United Nations to 
forge an end to the armed dispute and to hold general elections 
last year. The king blamed continued disputes among the 
Cambodian factions as the main cause of the political problem in 
his country. 
  The $3 billion UN administration of Cambodia during the 
transition period leading to the election was not just the most 
expensive UN operation, it achieved only partial success. That 
is, while the United Nations succeeded in organizing the 
election and formation of government of the people, it failed to 
achieved peace and national reconciliation, which were just as 
important. To date, no one can tell how much more investment 
will be needed to achieve the complete goal as desired by the 
United Nations. 
  It is strange that while so far there is no answer to the 
question of how much more the world has to pay to enable the 
Cambodian people to avoid genocide, certain countries have 
openly said that they are ready to make more investment by 
sending in their soldiers or providing arms to the Cambodians. 
This would only exacerbate the fighting in that country. It 
appears as if the world has put a cap on its budget for peace in 
Cambodia and has begun to contemplate a budget for war and 
destruction. As long as the Cambodian factions continue their 
disputes, the trend for more intense fighting could gain greater 
support from other Western countries. If the Cambodian leaders 
agree to the strange proposal advanced by the west, peace will 
likely be achieved only by extermination of the Cambodian race.

  [Text] Nineteen Muslim organizations have claimed that 
violence in the South was a consequence of the May 1992 turmoil, 
and not the work of separatists, according to a news bulletin. 
  The SAN EKKAPHAP (Solidarity News Bulletin), published by 
southern Muslim MPs, said the organizations believed the 
violence was not created by separatist guerrillas. The violence 
occurred as a result of the May upheavals which culminated in 
the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. 
  The organizations claimed the government had information 
relevant to the violence. It should reveal the facts in a 
straightforward manner, and improve its working system to 
prevent the situation from deteriorating. 
  "The government has to shoulder responsibility for the 
violent incidents. The government must take decisive action to 
prevent the situation from turning into bloodshed," they said. 
  The organizations said social and political problems had 
affected the South's economy. They claimed the South had lost 
BtlO billion in economic gains in the past year. 
  The bulletin is published by the Solidarity Muslim group of 
Muslim MPs from the five southernmost provinces, led by Deputy 
Interior Minister Den Tomina. 
  Den, a Pattani MP, said in the first issue of the bulletin 
that the publication was aimed at protecting Muslim interests 
and creating better understanding between Muslims and Buddhists. 
  Education Minister Samphan Thongsamak told reporters that 
the 
four Muslims accused of involvement in bomb attacks in the South 
are not preachers but teachers of religion. 
  The four suspects, who were granted bail on Tuesday, have 
been charged with sedition. Muslims have claimed the men were 
scapegoats, and it was speculated that they would rally to 
protest the arrests. 
  However, many senior police officers, including national 
police chief Prathin Santipraphop, have repeated several times 
they have substantive evidence to prove the men guilty. 
  Samphan said individuals suspected of committing crimes 
would 
be prosecuted in accordance with the law, regardless of their 
religion. 
  "It is not that if you are a Muslim, you will not be 
punished 
when you do wrong," he said. 
  Politicians should not intervene in the case because they 
could not change the truth. Police should not be disheartened 
and should proceed according to the law, Samphan said. 
  Some Muslim MPs of the New Aspiration Party, also claiming 
the men were scapegoats, have said they would represent them in 
court. 
  In Songkhla, Police Director General Prathin yesterday said 
police had sufficient evidence to take legal action. The 
suspects had the right to ask that new investigators be 
appointed, but he would have the final say. 
  Assistant police chief Michai Nukunkit said investigators 
would file suits against the suspects next week. Army Commander 
in Chief Wimon Wongwanit said crime suspects must be prosecuted 
with an even hand, regardless of their religion.

  [Text] The Thai Navy detained a Vietnamese boat named 
"TD-008" with 14 crewmen and a number of weapons in Thai 
territorial waters on 7 February while the boat was chasing Thai 
fishing trawlers. It was charged with an act of terrorism and a 
violation of international and Thai laws. Later on, Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai and his delegation visited the SRV 
between 16-19 March at the invitation of the Vietnamese prime 
minister. During their meeting on 17 March, the foreign 
ministers of the two countries discussed the issue of the 
release of the fishermen, proposing an exchange for Thai 
fishermen held in Vietnam. Vietnam offered to release Thai 
fishermen held in Vietnam as soon as possible and to consider 
releasing 16 Thai prisoners held for trying to escape prisons 
and for killing people in Can Tho Province, provided that the 
relatives of those prisoners agreed to pay a fine of U.S. 
$20,000 as judged by the court. At the same time, Vietnam 
asked Thailand to release the 14 Vietnamese crewmen held by the 
Thai Navy. Subsequently, the Thai prime minister agreed to 
release the 14 Vietnamese to promote good relations with Vietnam 
and to create a good atmopshere for future talks with Vietnam on 
other issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Dear Foreign Minister, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet has just concluded his official friendship 
visit to the Union of Myanmar [Burma]. This is the last country 
in Southeast Asia that our Prime Minister has visited. Would you 
please elaborate on the significance of the visit? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] We are continuing to implement our foreign 
policy of diversified diplomatic activities in various forms. 
In implementing this policy, we have attached importance to 
developing relations with regional countries. Myanmar is a 
country in Southeast Asia that has many similar features, 
historically and culturally, to Vietnam. People of the two 
countries have supported and assisted each other during the 
struggle for their national independence. I would like to 
recall that 36 years ago, Uncle Ho visited this country. During 
the past several decades, due to changes in the region that 
include the war in Vietnam and upheaval in Myanmar, relations in 
various fields between the two nations did not develop well. 
Now, the trend of cooperation and development is prevailing in 
our region, and we are striving to strengthen relations with all 
Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar. 
  Our prime minister's visit to Myanmar this time is aimed at 
consolidating the existing relations between the two nations 
while asserting our wish to develop the bilateral relations in 
the new stage to truly serve the trend of development in the 
region. 
  [Correspondent] Dear Foreign Minister, you just stressed the 
significance of the visit. Would you please elaborate on the 
concrete results of the visit? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] Our ancestors are correct in saying that 
we 
will see things precisely on the spot. Reading books on 
realities of a nation, we can see but a general view; when we 
visit the country, see its realities, and get in touch with its 
people, we understand more about that country. Through the 
visit to Myanmar, the Vietnamese delegation could see its 
realities and exchanged views with our Myanmar friends to 
correctly assess the trend of development and cooperation 
between the two countries. First, I would like to say that this 
visit has helped in strengthening the mutual understanding, 
thereby creating a profound mutual trust. Through the visit, we 
clearly see the Myanmar people's sentiment toward Vietnam. The 
Myanmar government and people extended a very warm welcome to 
the Vietnamese delegation. Tens of thousands of people lined up 
the streets, waving Vietnamese and Myanmar flags to welcome the 
Vietnamese guests from the airport to the guest house and along 
streets leading to various production establishments and 
localities. Generally speaking, the Myanmar people went to the 
streets to express their sentiment toward the Vietnamese 
delegation and people. 
  During our meetings with the Myanmar leaders and people, 
they 
have expressed their respect for Vietnam by saying that the 
Vietnamese people have a very strong determination in the 
struggle for national independence and national construction and 
defense. The Myanmar people also have such a quality, thereby 
they highly respect the Vietnamese people and admire the latter 
for their creativity and the spirit of self-reliance in building 
the Vietnamese nation. They also hope that Myanmar will develop 
successfully in the same spirit. This has strengthened the ties 
and mutual trust between the two nations. I should say that 
this is very important especially when our two countries are in 
the process of developing their respective nations. While 
Vietnam and Myanmar are facing numerous difficulties and their 
capabilities in developing their nations are low, they are 
striving to find ways and means to help each other. Through 
various meetings and talks, both sides have agreed to cooperate 
with each other in various fields. Myanmar has a very vast 
forest area. The country has an area of more than 770,000 
square km or two times larger than Vietnam, 58 percent of which 
are forests, mostly the precious timber trees. As a result, 
Myanmar has extensive experience in protecting, managing, and 
exploiting forests, thus we can learn this from our Myanmar 
friends. Myanmar also has ample experience in exploiting and 
producing precious stones. Myanmar has great potential in 
producing these stones, thus it has vast experience in 
exploiting, fixing prices, and selling these precious stones and 
in making them into valuable ornamental items. Myanmar has 
expressed a willingness to share its experiences with Vietnam in 
this regard. 
  In addition, it must be said that though 
Myanmar's economy is still developing and facing financial 
difficulties, the government and people attach great importance 
to cultural heritage and make due efforts to preserve national 
traits. Therefore, they spend money to restore ancient cultural 
relics, including the ancient imperial city in Mandalay and the 
Shwe Dagon Pagoda, which is both a cultural and religious relic 
that has existed for more than 2,500 years now. Apart from 
their great cultural value, these relics are of practical 
important significance because they serve as very important 
tourist attractions. 
  We can cooperate with Myanmar in another field. By this, I 
mean Myanmar's due concern for environmental protection. This 
can be seen through the government's efforts to keep urban areas 
and other parts of the country green. Well-defined plans and 
long-term projects have been worked out to meet this goal to 
serve future development. On this occasion, we agreed to 
cooperate with Myanmar in tourism. At the same time, we also 
agreed to exchange experiences in the preservation and 
restoration of cultural and historic relics. 
  As far as the Myanmar side is concerned, it also showed keen 
interest in our country. The Myanmar government fully realizes 
that our country used to be a major rice importer but has now 
become an important rice exporter. Therefore, the Myanmar side 
wished to cooperate with us in agriculture and wanted us to 
exchange seedlings, first of all rice varieties and silkworm 
breeders, that we have great development potential. At the same 
time, it wanted to learn from our water conservancy experiences, 
including our hydroelectricity-generating experiences. Thus, 
the two sides realized that they could cooperate not only in the 
economic field but also in cultural and artistic activities. 
  [Correspondent] Based on your above-mentioned remarks, is it 
correct to say that in the immediate and far future, the 
friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Myanmar will 
develop well? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] I am positive about that. Though the 
results I have just mentioned are only initial ones, they serve 
as the groundwork for both sides to further broaden bilateral 
relations and take practical steps to ensure effective results 
for the two countries. It must be said that this visit has laid 
the groundwork for a new developmental step in the relations 
between Myanmar and Vietnam. It must be said that in addition 
to those traditional relations, both sides need more conditions 
to create a new development step in bilateral relations. This 
is a very important move. It is certain that thanks to the 
aforementioned practical results, the trends of cooperation and 
development in the region, and particularly, the mutual 
understanding between the two countries, mutual trust will be 
further strengthened. This will serve as the basis for 
broadening bilateral relations in all fields. It is also certain 
that this factor will benefit not only the development of 
Vietnam and Myanmar but will also contribute greatly to the task 
of turning Southeast Asian into a region of peace, stability, 
and development. 
  [Correspondent] I would like to ask you one last question, 
Mr. Minister. You have visited many countries. As far as your 
recent visit to Myanmar is concerned, what are your personal 
impressions of the capital city of Rangoon in particular and the 
Union of Myanmar in general? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] This is my first visit to Myanmar, and it 
has left profound impressions on me. In my opinion, Myanmar is 
not a poor country but a nation with great potential. To me, 
what is more important here is the fact that the people of 
Myanmar display a high spirit of independence, sovereignty, and 
self-sufficiency. Based on such time-honored relics like the 
Shwe Dagon Pagoda that has lasted for more than 2,500 years now 
and on such modern facilities like the Parliament Building where 
every architectual pattern reflects national traits, I can say 
that even though many difficulties still lie ahead, the 
development potential of Myanmar and the creativeness of its 
people are by no means limited. Therefore, in the framework of 
world development, it is certain that Myanmar will develop at a 
very fast-breaking pace. I was also impressed by the fact that 
the government of Myanmar has succeeded in linking ancient 
national character with modern development. There is every 
reason to believe that thanks to their cretiveness and spirit of 
independence and self-sufficiency, the people of Myanmar will 
achieve a fast-breaking national development pace. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Minister.

  [Text] A spokesperson for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry 
says that Thanh Long Sea area lies entirely under Vietnam's 
sovereignty. On this issue, our radio editor has this to say: 
  In recent days, many activities have been taken by a number 
of countries which have complicated the situation in the Truong 
Sa [Spratly] Archipelago and on Vietnam's continental shelf. 
  Despite the Vietnamese Government's statements on its 
continental shelf and special economic zone, the Creston Company 
of the United States on 8 May 1992 signed an agreement on oil 
and gas exploration with a Chinese company in an area they 
called Wananbei-21, which is in fact the Tu Chinh area of 
Vietnam. The Vietnamese Government immediately voiced its 
protest, considering the move a violation of Vietnam's 
sovereignty, but it ignored Vietnam's statement. On 18 April 
1994, Creston again announced a seismic survey in the area. 
Foreign reports on 10 May quoted a spokesman for the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry saying that the Thanh Long Sea area belongs to 
the adjacent waters of Nansha Island, which is in fact Vietnam's 
Truong Sa Archipelago. He even said that the exploration 
contract signed between Vietnam and the Mobil Oil Company was 
illegal. 
  On the question of Truong Sa and Tu Chinh, the Vietnamese 
Government has many times affirmed that they are under Vietnam's 
sovereignty. At a press conference in Hanoi on 5 May, a 
spokesperson of the Vietnam Foreign Ministry said: Vietnam has 
enough historical and legal documents proving its sovereignty 
over Truong Sa Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities of 
exploration and exploitation of natural resources of Truong Sa 
area without the permit of Vietnam are acts of violation of its 
sovereignty. 
  On the settlement of disputes, Vietnam has on many occasions 
stated that disputes should be settled in the spirit of 
equality, mutual understanding, and mutual respect in accordance 
with international law and the Convention on the Maritime Law of 
1982, and in respect of the sovereignty of all countries over 
exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. All parties 
concerned should restrain themselves not to further complicate 
the situation, use violence, or threat to use violence. Vietnam 
is persistent on this line. As for Tu Chinh, Vietnam affirms 
that it lies within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and 
continental shelf, entirely under Vietnam's sovereignty. 
Vietnam has the sovereign right to explore for and exploit 
natural resources in this area by itself or in cooperation with 
other foreign countries, the right which no other country may 
interfere. Tu Chinh and Thanh Long are in no way related to the 
Truong Sa Archipelago or the adjacent waters. Any statement or 
any contrary act to these principles is illegal and runs counter 
to the international law.

  [Text] Under the headline "National and Revolutionary 
Traditions Always Serve as a Spiritual Driving Force in the 
Cause of National Renovation," an editorial in today's NHAN DAN 
reads in part: 
  The various activities organized to commemorate the 40th 
anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory are just winding down, 
but the memory of the Dien Bien Phu victory and other heroic 
victories in the cause of national liberation and unification 
will continue to be held forever in the hearts of millions of 
our compatriots and countless friends worldwide. 
  Led by the party, our country is entering a new stage of its 
national history in which we will have to carry out national 
industrialization and modernization under the conditions and 
circumstances Vietnam is now facing. Given Vietnam's choice of 
approach -- and with the wisdom, creativity, and self-reliance 
of the Vietnamese people -- we are determined to prevail in our 
renovation process and national development and keep pace with 
our friends across the five continents while retaining our own 
identity. 
  Lying ahead are not only new opportunities but also 
countless 
difficulties and challenges requiring every person, every 
collective and locality, and the entire country to show the 
determination to surge forward by continuing to develop their 
tradition of persistently struggling toward the goal of building 
a prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equitable and 
civilized society. In this way we will be worthy of the 
sacrifices of preceding generations.

  [Text] In compliance with the National Assembly Standing 
Committee's system of coordination for periodic meetings between 
state organs, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh and Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet co-chaired a meeting held on 9 May 1994 to 
discuss implementing a resolution of the Ninth National 
Assembly's fourth session on practicing thrift and fighting 
wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling. 
  Present at the meeting were National Assembly vice-chairmen; 
deputy prime ministers; the chief judge of the Supreme People's 
Court; the procurator of the Supreme People's Organ of Control; 
members of the National Assembly Standing Committee; and leading 
cadres of various relevant ministries, departments, and sectors. 
  The meeting heard a report and exchanged views on the issue 
of practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, and on a 
question which was raised at a meeting held in April on how 
various cases of corruption and smuggling have been dealt with. 
  As for efforts to discover various cases of corruption and 
smuggling and the orientations for continually dealing with 
various newly-discovered cases of corruption and smuggling, 
especially cases of car and motorcycle smuggling in a number of 
localities and units, and based on suggestions made at the 
meeting and given the need to scrupulously implement the 
National Assembly resolution in this domain, the chairman of the 
National Assembly and the prime minister drew conclusions on the 
following issues: 
  1. In compliance with the National Assembly resolution, 
together with the administration at all levels and relevant 
sectors, the government and law protection organs have in the 
past made great efforts and taken positive measures to discover 
and deal with cases of corruption and smuggling, thus helping 
overcome the slow legal process against various cases. However, 
what has been done so far are just initial efforts, and they are 
still not enough to stop these bad practices. In the period 
ahead, it is necessary to accelerate efforts to look into and 
take legal action against those serious cases still left in the 
backlog as well as those newly-discovered cases. To achieve 
this aim, we must devote more time to scrutinizing, supervising, 
and discovering such cases. We must promptly take legal action 
against those cases which are already evident, continue to try 
those cases whose legal procedures have not yet been completed, 
and urgently enforce court sentences on those cases already 
tried while paying appropriate attention to resolving complaints 
and denunciations of citizens in this domain. And there must be 
close cooperation between law enforcement organs themselves and 
between central and local organs. It is necessary to continue 
to study and come up with specific policies aimed at 
satisfactorily implementing the National Assembly resolution and 
other law stipulations and promptly reestablish order and 
discipline in state and social management. 
  3. [number as heard] The meeting hailed various localities 
and units for having drawn up and registered substantive plans 
to implement the policy on the practice of thrift. They have 
pledged to cut their total spending by at least 5 percent as 
envisaged by the National Assembly in its resolution on the 1994 
state budget estimate. The meeting also asked various sectors, 
echelons, and units to work out specific plans to scrupulously 
implement the National Assembly resolution and effectively use 
the money they may save. 
  4. It is necessary to assign relevant organs the duty of 
helping the government prepare a report which will be presented 
before the National Assembly at its upcoming session on how the 
National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and fighting 
wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling has been carried 
out.

  [Text] Hanoi -- Vietnam is preparing a draft law on 
narcotics which it hopes can be passed by Parliament next year 
with a view to coping with the rise in drug abuse and 
international drug trafficking, according to a senior official. 
  In the meantime, the Government is stepping up efforts to 
deal with the unprecedented surge in drug abuse in major cities 
as well as the cross-border opium trade with Laos and China. 
  Minister Hoang Duc Nghi, who chairs the National Committee 
for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas recently visited 
Thailand, Burma and Indonesia to discuss "measures of 
cooperation" with neighboring countries to fight illicit drugs. 
  Vietnam has no laws on narcotics to date. Drug abuse is 
currently classified as a form of "social ill" and users are 
"rehabilitated" rather than punished. Only drug trafficking is 
considered a "crime". 
  There is widespread drug abuse in major cities such as Hanoi 
and Ho Chi Minh City, and authorities are worried that Vietnam 
has become a favored transit point for drug shipments to the 
United States and western Europe. 
  "International drug traffickers abuse the loose controls in 
Vietnam. We were informed by Interpol that money laundering has 
taken place in Vietnam, and we have in fact discovered some 
cases," said Deputy Minister Xuan of the National Committee for 
Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas. 
  While opium growing and addiction are prevalent among ethnic 
minorities in northern border provinces, police have detected 
larger quantities of heroin in circulation. Cocaine has also 
already appeared in Vietnam. 
  Deputy Minister Xuan said authorities in one case arrested a 
cocaine trafficker in Ho Chi Minh City, and in another 
intercepted the drug which originated from Latin America as it 
arrived at Qui Nhon port in Binh Dinh province. 
  Police reports from Germany, Russia and Canada indicate some 
narcotics that showed up in their countries transmitted in 
Vietnam, he said. 
  As requested by Interpol, Vietnam has recently helped 
extradite an ethnic Vietnamese with American nationality wanted 
by US authorities on drug trafficking charges. He was hiding 
and suspected of laundering money in Vietnam. "In 1993 we also 
extradited many others through cooperation with Interpol." 
  Vietnam has sentenced one foreigner to death, the first such 
sentence last year, and so far capital punishment has been 
handed down on three drug traffickers. 
  Closer to home, Vietnam has seen more frequent and larger 
amounts of opium moving through the country from Laos. The 
drugs either remain in Vietnam or are being directed to China. 
  Deputy Minister Xuan said Vietnam only recently became aware 
of the "serious extent of the problem" when Hanoi tightened 
police and customs checks at three official crossings with Laos 
-- in Tay Trang in Lai Chau province opposite Phong Saly, Song 
Ma in Son La province across from Houa Phan and Ky Son in Nghe 
An province opposite Xieng Khouang. 
  "It's very difficult to monitor what's going on in countless 
other unofficial border crossings," he said. 
  Vietnamese authorities suspect some drugs from the Golden 
Triangle, seeking to avoid tight controls in China at that part 
of the border, have eventually gone to China anyway through 
Vietnam. 
  He said the route spans from Laos into Lai Chau province, 
then to Hanoi and on to Lang Son which borders China's Yunnan 
province. 
  In Vietnam itself, Mr Xuan said there were currently 3,770 
hectares of opium growing area, as against 12,878 hectares in 
1992- 1993 due to government suppression and "tactics of 
persuasion" among ethnic minorities, especially the Hmong, to 
plant cash crops. 
  The anti-drug draft law in the making will unify all matters 
related to illicit drugs including those absent or scattered in 
different orders, decrees, criminal codes. 
  Experts from the United Nations Drug Control Program are due 
in Hanoi soon to help the Vietnamese draft a master plan to 
combat narcotics abuse and trafficking, the subject of a 
national program, according to Mr Xuan. 
  Vietnam is also studying the possibility of acceding to the 
1961 Convention on Illicit Drugs. The Government has appointed 
an interagency committee to study the issue. 
  "My opinion is that Vietnam should join this convention as 
soon as possible. We hesitated in the past because we did not 
have much knowledge of the issue," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Station Correspondent Truong Cong Hoa] </F>
  [Summary] "Dear Friends: On 12-13 May, State President Le 
Duc Anh paid a working visit to Hai Hung Province. The 
president spent a great deal of time visiting agriculture, 
handicraft, and industrial establishments as well as peasant 
patriots." 
  In Hai Hung Province, President Le Duc Anh visited Me So 
Village in Chau Giang District and Hung Dao Village in Tu Loc 
District. In these villages, he listened to reports on the 
efforts of local people to improve local agriculture production. 
He also visited and presented gifts to Mrs. Tran Thi Phu, 84 
years old and mother of two fallen combatants in Phu Thi Hamlet. 
  The president visited the Hai Duong Water Pump Production 
Plant and the Hai Duong Ceramic Company, two production units of 
the central government located in Hai Hung Province. He 
commended these two economic units for their efforts to compete 
with imported products. "In these units, President Le Duc Anh 
reminded party cadres and government officials to strictly 
implement the principles of publicity and democracy in 
production management and income distribution. He urged them to 
concentrate the collective strength of party committees, the 
workers' union, and the youth union on production development. 
He reminded them that they must not forget their obligation to 
the state and their responsibility to the local area, which is 
in addition to the need for improvements in the material lives 
of the cadres and workers. 
  "Apart from the visits to agricultural and industrial 
production units, President Le Duc Anh held a working session 
with Hai Hung province leaders to listen to reports on the 
provincial socioeconomic situation by Comrade Pham Van Tho, 
member of the party Central Committee and secretary of the 
provincial party committee; and Nguyen Van Du, chairman of the 
Hai Hung Province People's Committee. He hailed the Hai Hung 
party committees and government for gaining a thorough 
understanding of party resolutions before skillfully applying 
them to the local, practical situation, by means of which they 
scored comprehensive victories in economic development in Hai 
Hung, manifested in a relatively high economic development rate 
and progress in the poverty alleviation work." 
  President Le Duc Anh also asked many questions about the 
local situation. Speaking to key provincial leaders at a local 
meeting to disseminate Resolutions No. 04 and 07 of the party 
Political Bureau, he expressed his joy at the socioeconomic 
achievements of the Hai Hung party committees and people. He 
said: 
  [Begin recording] "President Ho Chi Minh always called for 
unity in our party and people. In his statement, he compared 
unity in the party and in the organization with the apples of 
our eyes. Therefore, the motto: Unity, Unity, Great Unity and 
Success, Success, and Great Success is both a formula for and a 
decisive factor in our party's success in the national 
liberation and renovation undertaking. The entire people can 
unite only when the party unites itself. Only unity can help us 
overcome all challenges; this is the fundamental issue that 
leads to success. Unity can also lead to creativeness from the 
people. I urge the party committee and people to continue 
extending their success on the basis of the recorded 
achievements to take this province to a new step, contribute to 
national modernization and industrialization, and fulfill the 
goal of making the population prosperous, the country strong, 
and society just and civilized. I wish you all good health" [end 
recording] 
  Before leaving the province, President Le Duc Anh visited 
the 
provincial specialized school for talented students. There, he 
urged the Hai Hung party committee, government, and people to 
pay more attention to the education service. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and people, 
Party 
Secretary Pham Van Tho promised: 
  [Begin recording] "On behalf of the province, I extend my 
thanks to Comrade Le Duc Anh and I promise to the party Central 
Committee and to you that Hai Hung will expand its fine 
tradition and initial achievements to accomplish all the targets 
outlined by the provincial party congress, thereby fulfilling 
your expectations and those of the party Central Committee. I 
wish President Le Duc Anh good health." [end recording]

  [Text] By 2 May 1994, the Tra Vinh Provincial Post and 
Telegraph Service had completed a digitized telecommunication 
network in the province that covers eight districts and towns 
and 75 villages, including Hoa Minh and Long Hoa villages in the 
Ban Dong estuary area. 
  The province has leased nearly 2,300 telephones, over 2.5 
times higher than the number of phones at the time the province 
was separated from the former province. Nearly 600 of these 
telephones -- nearly 25 percent of the total -- have been 
installed in remote areas and areas occupied by ethnic Khmer 
compatriots. 
  Tra Vinh is the first province to have 100 percent of its 
villages and districts covered by a digitized telecommunication 
network. The Tra Vinh Post and Telegraph Service plans to 
install about 5,000 to 5,500 more telephones by the end of this 
year, including 800 to 1,200 sets to be leased to rural areas.

  [Text] Tokyo, may 14 KYODO -- The largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will soon submit a no-confidence 
motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet, LDP 
President Yohei Kono said in an interview published Saturday [14 
May]. 
  The once-dominant LDP will submit a no-confidence motion 
onto 
the floor of the House of Representatives "as the current 
administration controls only 40 percent of the House of 
Representatives' total seats," Kono told the ASAHI SHIMBUN 
newspaper. 
  Kono, whose LDP lost its 38-year lock on power last August, 
said the party will table the motion shortly after the passage 
of the long-overdue fiscal 1994 state budget program, now six 
weeks behind the start of the new fiscal year. The budget is 
widely expected to pass the Diet by the end of June. 
  The current Diet session ends June 29. 
  Kono said the LDP, which has 206 seats in the 511-member 
chamber, needs the support of its archrival the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan], which has 74 seats, to push the 
motion through the lower house with a necessary majority of 256 
votes. 
  "The LDP does not single-handedly have the majority, so it 
needs the cooperation with a multiple number of political 
parties to exert a decisive influence," he said. 
  "The LDP wants to collaborate with the Social Democratic 
Party... to scuttle the current administration if our two 
parties' perceptions of the current power balance coincide," he 
said. 
  However, Kono acknowledged in the interview that there is a 
deep gulf between the policies and ideologies of the two 
longtime archrival parties. 
  "Yes, there is a large gap. We need to hold further 
discussion within the LDP concerning the advisability of 
immediately initiating talks (with the SDP) for reconciling 
policy gaps," he said. 
  Kono said the current political situation would give a 
definite advantage to the LDP in what he sees as an imminent 
general election, adding that his party prefers to contest it 
under the new single-seat constituency system, the daily said. 
  Kono predicted, however, that Hata may respond to the 
motion's passage by disbanding his cabinet en masse and then 
having a new premier from the coalition call a general election 
under the single- seat constituency system, which first requires 
passage of an electoral redistricting bill.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rice Import and GATT Rules"] </F>
  [Text] President Suharto opened a three-day national 
coordination meeting on food industry at the National Palace in 
Jakarta on Thursday (21/4). Adressing the ceremony, he said it 
is not totally right to think that Indonesia would not be able 
to sustain its rice self-sufficiency if it has to import rice 
from other countries. The head of state said Indonesia can 
still import rice, but at the same time it has to export its 
rice. He said that Indonesia has to comply with this system 
because this is a more profitable way of developing the national 
food industry. According to the president, this mechanism can 
also be applied to other commodities but inter-sectional 
cooperation is essential in tackling difficulties in the 
food-related businesses. 
  In the past, the import of rice had been linked to the issue 
of Indonesia's inability to achieve self-sufficiency in the 
commodity. This happened in 1991 when Indonesia imported 178 
tons of rice, while there were no exports at all. In 1992, 
Indonesia exported 72,000 tons and imported 63,000 tons of rice. 
Indonesia had imported 375 tons and exported only 11,000 tons 
prior to achieving self-sufficiency in 1984. 
  It is interesting to note that President Suharto's 
observation on the food industry, especially when it is linked 
to GATT rules on rice imports, signed recently at the GATT 
ministerial conference in Marrakech, Morocco. Under the 
agreement, every signatory is required to import rice amounting 
to three percent of its domestic consumption. This means the 
world rice market will be widened and that it will be possible 
for Indonesia to increase exports of excess rice. 
  It has been reported that Indonesia's 1993 rice export 
reached 30 million tons and its domestic consumption 25 million 
tons. The extra five million tons are reserves and would be 
exported should the surplus rise. Meanwhile, based on world 
food statistics, the world supply of rice is about 12 million 
tons or about four percent of the world output, or about 300 
million tons. All this while the world rice market has been 
dominated by the United States, Vietnam, and Thailand. These 
three countries supply about 70 percent of the rice in the world 
market. In such conditions, rice prices in the world market 
have become unstable. 
  On the other hand, when all signatories are required to 
strictly observe GATT rules on the rice trade, Indonesia is 
required to import about 700,000 tons of rice. However, at the 
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in December 1993, Indonesia 
managed to bargain for some relaxation to the rules. In the 
meeting, Ibrahim Hasan, minister of state for food affairs and 
head of the Logistics Board who was leading the Indonesian 
delegation, explained Indonesia's difficulties in observing the 
GATT rules in view of the characteristics of the world rice 
market and the fact that it has a huge population to feed. 
  Some time ago, Syarifudin Baharsyah, minister of 
agriculture, 
announced that Indonesia had been forced to import 10,000 tons 
of rice from the United States. This was not because Indonesia 
faced a shortage, but the consequence of being one of the 
signatories of the GATT multilateral trade agreement. With the 
existence of the obligatory rice import rule, we can anticipate 
that the considerable amount of rice being imported may 
negatively affect our domestic rice market. 
  Even though the amount to be imported is relatively small 
compared to the domestic consumption of 25 million tons, 
Indonesia still has to take measures so that it will not affect 
the domestic market where local farmers are the producers. In 
addition, Indonesia must pick the quality of the rice it imports 
from the United States. In connection with this, Ibrahim Hasan 
said the rice imported would only be sold at special stores in 
the country or consumed at hotels and restaurants. 
  Indonesia has to intensify efforts to increase its rice 
exports to counter the pressure for rice imports due to the 
minimum access opportunity (MAO) regulation under GATT. The 
other alternative that Indonesia can resort to is to impose high 
tariff barriers on imported rice. Somehow, in reality it looks 
like Indonesia will pursue the two alternatives. 
  The nature of rice self-sufficiency achieved by Indonesia 
depends on trend [two preceding words in English]. Its exports 
or imports are based on economic considerations and efficiency. 
On the basis of this, Indonesia has expressed its willingness 
to import a maximum of 50 percent of the 70,000 tons of rice it 
used to import with a 90 percent tariff quota. The tariffs to 
be imposed on the remainder of the imports will depend on the 
domestic price stability with a 180-percent tariff quota. 
Ibrahim Hasan said Indonesia will also implement the CBO 
(Ceiling Binding Offer) [preceding four words in English] 
because CBO is more profitable than any open tariff system.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Reiterates DPRK's Stand on </F>
Replacement of Fuel Rods" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry today answered a question put by KCNA regarding 
the beginning of the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station. 
  He said: 
  As is known, the replacement of fuel rods has begun at our 5 
megawatt experimental nuclear power station according to its 
operation plan. 
  This refueling is part of the undertakings to normalize our 
peaceful nuclear activities. 
  As we have clarified time and again, we could not freeze the 
operation of the graphite moderated reactor system for an 
indefinite period, incurring economic losses, since the prospect 
of implementation of the DPRK-USA agreement on converting the 
graphite moderated reactor system to a light water reactor 
system became dim as a result of the abortion of the third round 
of talks. 
  Moreover, the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station could not be delayed any 
longer in view of its technical safety. 
  That is why we sent a telex message to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on April 19 informing it of our 
replacement plan in advance and requesting it to observe it and 
promptly take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel 
rods. 
  Later, we sent telex messages to the agency on four 
occasions, repeatedly requesting it to take relevant measures 
including the removal of seals for a smooth operation of the 
facilities. And we agreed to all the demands of the agency with 
regard to its observation, except for the selection and 
preservation of the fuel rods, a matter which is beyond our 
unique status, and issued in good time entry visas to the 
agency's inspectors. 
  Moreover, we allowed, as an exception, inspection activities 
for the continuity of safeguards requested by the Secretariat of 
the agency and even an "additional inspection" which it 
described as an "uncompleted inspection" during its inspection 
in March, taking into consideration the fact that the United 
States withdrew the precondition of "exchange of special envoys 
between the North and the South of Korea" which it had insisted 
on. 
  The Secretariat of the agency, however, persistently avoided 
sending a group of inspectors on unreasonable pretexts and did 
not take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel rods. 
Under such conditions, we had no other choice but to remove 
seals and start taking out fuel rods for safety reasons. 
  In this connection, we notified the agency that the whole 
course of the replacement of fuel rods would be placed under a 
strict watch of the agency's cameras. 
  All this was motivated by our utmost sincerity to prove the 
non- diversion of the replaced fuel rods to non-peaceful 
purposes and demonstrate the uprightness of our nuclear 
activities. 
  It is self-evident that such inspection activities falling 
under the categories of routine and ad hoc inspections as 
selection and preservation of some of the fuel rods can never be 
allowed in view of our unique status following a temporary 
suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  To select and preserve some of the fuel rods at this 
juncture 
means to take samples. This is an inequitable attitude ignoring 
our present unique status which excludes ad hoc inspection, and 
a prejudiced, unreasonable demand blindly casting "suspicion" on 
the DPRK. 
  We have already clearly notified the IAEA that we will 
contain all the spent fuel under strict surveillance of the IAEA 
and fully allow the IAEA to measure it when the nuclear issue is 
settled between the DPRK and the USA. 
  It is hardly understandable for the IAEA Secretariat to 
insist on selecting and preserving some of the fuel now, though 
it will be able to get the most correct results if it measures 
all the fuel at that time. 
  This makes us suspect that the IAEA Secretariat is not 
interested in the measurement of the fuel rods but is seeking 
the political purpose of gradually undermining our unique status 
under the cloak of measurement. 
  In its report on the results of the inspection in March at 
the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the United Nations 
Security Council, the Secretariat said it was "indispensable" to 
wind up the "incomplete inspection activities" at the 
radiochemical laboratory. So, we allowed them and now the 
Secretariat says it is "indispensable" to select and preserve 
fuel rods. This proves that there is no credibility in the 
attitude of the Secretariat. 
  This makes us conclude that the Secretariat's demand for 
selecting and preserving fuel rods at this juncture is aimed at 
fabricating another "inconsistency" which was one of the root 
causes of our withdrawal from the NPT and justifying its 
partiality toward the DPRK. 
  In view of our unique status, we are only obliged to provide 
the continuity of safeguards through the verification of the 
non- diversion of nuclear material, not the verification of the 
completeness and correctness of the initial inventory. 
  Though we decided to strictly contain the fuel rods and put 
them under the control of the agency, some quarters of the 
United States are now spreading the rumor that we are changing 
the fuel rods to extract plutonium enough for the manufacture of 
four or five nuclear bombs. This is quite contradictory to the 
fact and cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention 
to intensify pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of refueling. 
  Actually, refueling is taking place under the watch of the 
cameras installed by the agency. So, there is no ground to 
worry about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another 
purpose. 
  Now some quarters are contending that if we stopped and put 
off refueling, the problem of observation might be solved. This 
is, however, an unrealistic speculation that does not take into 
account the characteristics of the technical safety of our 
experimental atomic power plant. 
  If refueling is stopped midway, it may cause a new danger in 
the view of safety. 
  But we think that since refueling has just begun, there 
still 
remain possibilities to resolve the problem. 
  We proposed to the agency negotiations for an agreement on 
practical matters related to the presence at the replacement of 
fuel rods along with complicated outstanding issues with it. 
  The solution to the issue depends on the attitude of the 
agency. 
  If the agency persist in its unreasonable demand, ignoring 
our unavoidable conditions regarding the replacement of the fuel 
rods, the issue would become more complicated. 
  We will as ever make every possible effort for a fair and 
fundamental solution to the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> ["Arms Buildup Targeted Against Fellow Countrymen" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
is blaring that it will "additionally introduce" latest-type 
weapons under the pretext of "establishing a stronger security 
posture" and stage as scheduled all the war gambles including 
the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, not reducing their 
scale. 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  The reckless arms buildup of the Kim Yong-sam group and its 
war preparations to invade the North are unpardonable 
treacheries to plunge the fellow countrymen into the scourge of 
a nuclear war, in confrontation with them as a war servant of 
outside forces. 
  In stepping up arms buildup and war gambles under the 
pretext 
of "establishing a security posture" and carrying the situation 
on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase of war, the Kim 
Yong-sam group seeks to stay in power with the armed backing of 
the master, leaving South Korea under U.S. domination. The Kim 
Yong-sam group is a pack of bellicose elements who are racing 
headlong along the road of confrontation and war against fellow 
countrymen, in order to be "protected" by the U.S. military 
industrial complexes in reward for the fabulous profits ensured 
them which are trying to sell more weapons by increasing the 
tensions at any cost. 
  Our fellow countrymen who hold dear the dignity of the 
nation 
and love peace will never pardon those who hold personal ease 
and interests of outside forces dearer than the interests and 
destiny of the nation and do not hesitate to impose the 
holocaust of nuclear war upon the nation. 
  The Korean people and People's Army will sternly punish the 
South Korean puppets, if they attempt to do harm to fellow 
countrymen in league with foreign forces.

  [Excerpt] The Philippines yesterday advised China and 
Vietnam to resolve through dialogue their territorial dispute 
over the South China Sea where a search for oil is under way. 
  PetroVietnam oil company signed an agreement with Mobil Oil 
to explore the Blue Dragon field on Hanoi's continental shelf, 
adjacent to the disputed Spratly Islands, after Beijing signed a 
deal with another U.S. company, Crestone Energy Corp., to 
prospect in a nearby field with Chinese naval protection. 
  The contracts drew protests from both Hanoi and Beijing, and 
elicited concern from neighboring countries. 
  Philippine Foreign [Affairs] Secretary Roberto Romulo told 
reporters that Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan 
and Vietnam -- which claim all or part of the Spratlys -- 
"understand the Manila declaration" to seek a peaceful 
resolution to the conflict. 
  "We hope that there will be a dialogue and a meeting of the 
minds," he added. 
  Manila, which has given permission to foreign and local oil 
firms to prospect for oil in the central and southern 
Philippines, has likewise approved a geophysical survey and 
exploration contract (GSEC) with a consortium of seven Filipino 
firms to prospect an area that includes the Reed Bank, which 
adjoins the Spratlys. 
  Energy department sources said no foreign or Filipino oil 
firm has so far applied for a GSEC in the part of the Spratly 
area claimed by the Philippines. 
  "That is a difficult proposition," the sources said. "Nobody 
will enter that." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Chon Yo-ok] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team, led by its team chief (Hainamen), arrived in 
Beijing this morning and received visas from the North Korean 
Embassy there. The inspection team will enter Pyongyang via 
North Korea's Koryo airliner tomorrow afternoon. 
  The IAEA inspection team chief, (Hainamen), said at the 
airport that, according to the IAEA policy, he could not make 
any comments other than the fact that the inspection team will 
enter Pyongyang tomorrow. 
  As soon as it arrives in Pyongyang tomorrow, the inspection 
team will see if nuclear fuel rods at a 5-megawatt reactor in 
Yongbyon have really been replaced. 
  The IAEA policy is that if it determines that North Korea 
replaced the nuclear fuel rods after removing the seals of the 
reactor, the IAEA will regard [kyujong] this as a serious 
incident [simgakhan satae] and will cancel its entire inspection 
plan and pull out the inspection team earlier than scheduled. 
However, if North Korea has only begun preparations for the 
nuclear fuel rods replacement, such as the suspension of 
operating reactors, the IAEA team will carry out its inspection 
activities, such as additional inspections of the radiochemical 
laboratory, the replacement of surveillance equipment, and the 
checking of the seals at major nuclear facilities until 24 May. 
  Thomas McLarty, chief of staff at the White House, said on 
15 
May that the United States would watch the IAEA team's 
inspections of North Korea before deciding whether to increase 
its pressure on North Korea in connection with the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Noting that the fuel rods have regularly been replaced, 
McLarty said: The United States, however, is definitely 
concerned about their replacement by North Korea. The United 
States will consider all possible choices, including sanctions, 
if the IAEA inspection team's report on its activities in North 
Korea is different from what is expected. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate warned that the beginning of the 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods without the presence of the 
IAEA is a serious act that may lead to economic sanctions by the 
United Nations. 
  U.S. Senate leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties 
said the above in an interview with NBC TV and stressed that the 
United States should prepare countermeasures against the North 
Korean action in cooperation with the ROK, Japan, and China.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government expressed regret Saturday at reports that North Korea 
has begun the discharging process at its nuclear reactor, which 
Seoul, Washington and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) have denounced as an act that would end all dialogue. 
  "We cannot but lodge our regrets," said one Foreign Ministry 
official. But the official said Seoul will wait to make a formal 
response until after IAEA inspectors can determine the status of 
the reactor and how much of the process has been completed. 
  "We note the fact that despite North Korea's declaration 
that 
it has gone ahead with the discharge, it said there is still an 
opportunity for random selection and preservation of the fuel 
rods, " said the official. 
  "It would be inappropriate for us to declare a stance before 
the IAEA judgement." 
  North Korea had notified the United States at their 
working-level contact Friday and the Vienna-based IAEA that it 
could no longer defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its 
5-megawatt reactor due to technical reasons. 
  But the letter to the IAEA said Pyongyang has "just begun" 
the process and the agency still has time to choose the rods and 
place them under inspection for future measurement. 
  Seoul, Washington and the IAEA have repeatedly warned that 
changing the rods without IAEA supervision would end the 
dialogue phase and push the North Korean nuclear issue toward 
the U.N. Security Council. 
  But some sources here called North Korea's declaration more 
of a "bluff" aimed at dragging Washington to the negotiating 
table for further high-level talks. 
  It is still unclear whether North Korea went ahead with the 
core activities of the discharging process, which takes a 
considerable amount of time. 
  "The fact that Pyongyang said there is still an opportunity 
for random selection and securing of the rods seems to indicate 
the process is in a very rudimentary stage," said one source. 
  Others believe that North Korea is intent on gaining the 
upper hand in negotiations with the United States when 
high-level dialogue does resume.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Russia has presented its 
idea of a multilateral security system in Northeast Asia and 
asked for South Korea's cooperation, Defense Ministry officials 
said Friday. 
  South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae received a 
two-page letter during his visit to Moscow from his Russian 
counterpart Pavel Grachev, who said that maintaining peace and 
stability in Northeast Asia is an urgent issue. 
  Russia first proposed establishment of a regional 
multilateral security system to neighboring countries in 1986 
when Mikhail Gorbachev was president, but it is unusual for 
Moscow to deliver a letter to the South Korean Government, 
officials said. 
  The letter says that to maintain stability in Northeast 
Asia, 
countries in the region should observe military exercises in 
neighboring states, notify others of large-scale military 
movements in advance and establish a military dispute prevention 
center, they said.

<F P=106> ["Appeal to the nation" by Khieu Samphan, head of the party </F>
of Democratic Kampuchea; dated 14 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. Presently, the United States is arrogantly and 
shamelessly planning to serve as ringleader of the allies in 
providing arms to the communist Vietnamese's puppets and 
two-headed government for continuing to kindle the war to kill 
the Cambodian nation and people. 
  II. This is a continuation of the strategy of the allies and 
the communist Vietnamese to pit the traitorous Cambodians 
against the patriotic Cambodians and Cambodian people to kill 
the Cambodian nation and people, thus enabling them to compete 
for the benefits of the Cambodian nation and people. 
  III. After our nation and people valiantly and arduously 
struggled for the past 10 years and more against the aggressor 
communist Vietnamese, thus inflicting heavy defeats on them and 
plunging them into an impasse, the Western allies, headed by the 
United States, have resorted to a new strategy by joining hands 
with the communist Vietnamese to continue slaying the Cambodian 
nation and people. 
  The Baker-Shevardnadze communique issued in Paris in July 
1990 is an official and open declaration of this new strategy. 
  The communist Vietnamese's goal is to smash Democratic 
Kampuchea so that they can annex and turn Cambodia into another 
Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. 
They have continued to kindle their war of aggression in 
Cambodia to seek a chance to send more Vietnamese nationals to 
engulf Cambodia. 
  The United States and its evil allies also have the goal to 
smash Democratic Kampuchea to put Cambodia into their sphere of 
influence. This is why the allies, with the United States as the 
ringleader and France, Australia, and Japan as the proxies, have 
joined hands with the communist Vietnamese in launching various 
criminal activities. 
  1. They opposed the Paris Accords by refusing to give the 
right and power to the quadripartite Supreme National Council 
and not supervising the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from 
Cambodia; 
  2. They organized a sham election under the control of the 
communist Vietnamese administration and UNTAC [UN Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia]; 
  3. Immediately after the elections and establishing the 
two-headed government, they have continued to kindle the war by 
leading the forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the 
forces of the two Para groups [noncommunist resistance groups], 
which are U.S. puppet forces, to launch offensives against 
Democratic Kampuchea and the people in Stoung, Phnum Chhat, 
Anlung Veng, Pailin, and other areas. However, they have 
suffered successive defeats and more serious setbacks 
militarily, politically, economically, financially, and socially. 
  In the military field, the two categories of Para forces, 
which are U.S. puppets, are dissolving, and the communist 
Vietnamese puppet forces are badly beaten and collapsing. 
  In the political field, both the allies and their puppets 
grouped up with the communist Vietnamese puppets have all been 
exposed at home and abroad as the conspirators of the aggressor 
communist Vietnamese, as the warmongers, traitors, and the arch 
corruptors. 
  In the economic and financial fields, the communist 
Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government are collapsing. 
They have been able to survive only because of the small-scale 
aid drops from the allies. They are strangling one another and 
are plunging into the abyss. Although in an all-around impasse, 
they are blindly seeking to eliminate the Cambodian nation and 
people and Democratic Kampuchea through military means. 
  IV. In what situation are the United States, France, 
Australia, and the other evil allies jointly providing arms to 
the communist Vietnamese puppets? It is in a situation in which 
the two-headed government has only a decaying skin left. In 
reality, what remains is only the pure puppet administration and 
puppet army of the communist Vietnamese. The Vietnamese puppet 
administration and puppet army are also collapsing. They have 
no people on their side. The people very strongly oppose them. 
  This situation shows that the policy to continue kindling 
the 
war pursued by the United States and the other evil allies is a 
blind policy that will only lead them toward an abyss of more 
shameful defeats. 
  The overwhelming majority of countries around the world, 
especially in Southeast Asia, oppose this blind policy. 
  In the United States and other Western countries, public 
opinions has asked: Which is better -- to follow this policy to 
blindly kindle the war or to reconsider helping Cambodia achieve 
peace and national reconciliation? 
  More and more, public opinion has asked: What benefit do the 
United States and the allies expect to gain from opposing the 
national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia by continuing to 
provide dollars and arms to the communist Vietnamese puppets? 
  Those who ask these questions have become well aware of the 
fact that it is impossible to eliminate Democratic Kampuchea. 
Attacking Democratic Kampuchea is tantamount to attacking the 
Cambodian nation and people. 
  V. Esteemed and beloved compatriots, both the communist 
Vietnamese and the allies are very very cruel toward our 
Cambodian nation and people. They have been jointly mustering 
their puppet forces to serve their strategy to eliminate our 
nation and people. They have opposed our national 
reconciliation. They have opposed the national reconciliation 
policy of King Norodom Sihanouk. They have continued to kindle 
the war of the aggressor communist Vietnamese. However, they 
have suffered serious defeats successively. 
  The United States and the other evil allies are now openly 
taking the lead in providing arms to their puppets, that is, the 
communist Vietnamese and the Vietnamese puppets, to continue 
killing and exterminating our nation and people. 
  Therefore, we call on all compatriots to rise up and launch 
all forms of activities to check and smash this arch criminal 
plan. 
  Compatriots in the country should rise up and join hands 
with 
the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea in defending your 
villages, houses, farm lands, property, oxen, buffalo, and fowl. 
You should prevent yourselves from being forcibly recruited as 
soldiers or as militiamen. You should call on your offspring 
and husbands to desert the fascist administration and the 
battlefields and return home. 
  Compatriots in the cities should rise up to oppose the 
fascist regime, which is completely corrupt, betrays the country 
and people, and sells out our nation and territory to the 
communist Vietnamese and the alliance. You should rise up to 
demand national reconciliation and peace so that our nation and 
people and each of your families can survive and earn a living 
peacefully. 
  VI. I would like to take this opportunity to stress once 
again that the Democratic Kampuchean forces vehemently oppose 
the war, vehemently oppose the attempt to continue kindling the 
war of the communist Vietnamese, Vietnamese puppets, and the 
allies and their puppets. Democratic Kampuchea unswervingly 
adheres to the policy of national reconciliation. In whatever 
circumstances, it will never deviate from the king's five-point 
national reconciliation policy. 
  The king has repeatedly appealed to us that national 
reconciliation is the only holy medicine for our nation and 
people to regain genuine peace and thereby move on, step by 
step, toward achieving their national independence and 
sovereignty. 
  The king has said: War is death; peace is life. 
  However, if the communist Vietnamese and bellicose allies of 
all categories continue to oppose our national reconciliation 
and to kindle the war, they should look back at the past 
historic experiences, especially the experiences in the 
full-fledged war of aggression of the communist Vietnamese in 
the past 13 years and the war rekindled by the allies together 
with the communist Vietnamese from July 1993 until today. 
  These experiences clearly show that the evil elements and 
weaponry of the foreign aggressors definitely cannot conquer the 
solid and dynamic forces of unity of the Cambodian nation and 
people. 
  Reject the warmongers! 
  Down with the warmongers! 
  Long live the mighty great national united forces of the 
Cambodian nation and people! 
  Long live the mighty force of national reconciliation! 
  [Signed] Khieu Samphan, head of the party of Democratic 
Kampuchea 
  [Dated] 14 May 1994
