  [Text] A special team will leave for Malaysia today to 
look into the strike involving some 1,000 Filipino overseas 
contract workers [OCWs] at the Hyundai Construction Company in 
Sarawak, Malaysia. The team will be headed by Deputy Executive 
Director Leuterio Cojuangco of the National Conciliation and 
Mediation Board. 
  A Filipino worker has been seriously injured during a 
protest 
by thousands of Filipino overseas contract workers in Sarawak, 
Malaysia. The Filipino OCW's were protesting against unfair 
labor practices of their employers. 
  Labor Undersecretary Jose Brillantes said Jimmy Lorenzo was 
injured when he was truncheoned by Malaysian guards trying to 
prevent the Filipinos from staging their protest action. 
  The Filipino workers are complaining against low wages, 
illegal salary deductions, and poor accommodations at the job 
site.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] KOMPAS writes that Indonesia has in fact grounds to 
voice its objection to the Philippines over an Asia-Pacific 
conference on East Timor scheduled to be held at a university in 
Manila on 31 May. The Indonesian Government, which learned of 
the planned conference last October, subsequently voiced its 
objection. The objection was repeated in November 1993 and March 
1994. According to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, the objection 
stems from the fact that the conference organizers as well as 
the invitees, including Ramos Horta [a leader of the 
Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor or Fretilin] 
and his friends have a political goal, that is to mobilize 
public opinion to question the incorporation of East Timor into 
the Republic of Indonesia. Despite our doubts over their 
possible success in changing the current status of East Timor, 
the conference could in any way affect the efforts of Indonesia, 
the United Nations, and Portugal to settle comprehensively the 
East Timor issue. Accordingly, the Philippine Government should 
immediately move to cancel the planned conference because there 
could be a thunderbolt in the broad daylight in 
Indonesian-Philippine relations if the conference is held. 
  Meanwhile, the daily ANGKATAN BERSENJATA says that the 
conference can be categorized as a forum of discussions on human 
rights rather than an academic one by whatever standards. Based 
on pamphlets circulated by the conference organizers, the 
delegates will discuss ways of achieving the independence of 
East Timor -- a political goal. Accordingly, the Indonesian 
Government and people hope that Philippine President Fidel Ramos 
will change his stand over the extremely sensitive issue that 
may undermine Indonesian-Philippine relations. 
  SUARA KARYA stresses that Indonesia understands the dilemma 
faced by the Philippines. For the sake of close bilateral 
relations, the Philippine Government, however, may in any way 
prevent Philippine territory from being used as a base by 
Fretilin and its supporters to launch anti-Indonesian campaigns. 
As a comparison, the Indonesian Government will, for example, 
never allow Indonesian territory to be used as a base by the 
Moros [Moro National Liberation Front] to conduct 
anti-Philippine activities. The daily believes that as a 
preliminary step, the Philippine Government may deny entry to 
Fretilin leaders who want to attend the conference.

  [Text] Jakarta, REPUBLIKA -- H.M. Sanusi, who was jailed 
for subversion, was released from the Cipinang Correction Center 
in Jakarta on Friday. His release followed the earlier release 
of A.M. Fatwa, Abdul Qadir Jaelani, Rahmat Basuki, and a number 
of other political detainees. Sanusi was released in a very 
simple and quiet ceremony at 1045 West Indonesian Standard Time 
yesterday in contrast to the earlier release of a number of his 
friends. "I am very happy," Sanusi told REPUBLIKA last night. 
  Present during the ceremony yesterday were Alamsyah Bur, 
head 
of the Jakarta Regional Office of the Department of Justice; 
Suharto, head of the Cipinang Correction Center; his five sons 
and six grandchildren, and his friends Dr. Anwar Harjono and 
A.M. Fatwa. Sanusi himself learned of his imminent release on 
Thursday morning. "I intentionally did not inform my friends 
about it," he said. 
  Sanusi had undergone the resocialization process since 
November 1993. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison by the 
Central Jakarta District Court in 1985 for allegedly 
masterminding the explosion of a number of Bank Central Asia 
offices. He was later sentenced in the same year to 20 years 
for alleged involvement in the explosion of the Borobudur 
Temple. The second verdict was, however, annulled by the 
Supreme Court. He was released conditionally on Friday after 
serving two-thirds [as published] of his jail term. 
  Having been in prison for almost 10 years, the man, who was 
born in Klaten on 28 November 1920, however, spoke 
enthusiastically. He was even not reluctant to talk about his 
life. "Let's talk about politics," said Sanusi when asked about 
the technical aspects of his release. The former industry 
minister of the Republic of Indonesia in the Ampera Cabinet from 
1966 to 1968 said that he would again be involved in social and 
mass activities after performing a hajj pilgrimage. "I have not 
changed," he said enthusiastically. 
  Sanusi, who was an official of the Muhammadiyah [an Islamic 
sociocultural and educational organization] Central Executive 
Board from 1965 to 1985, said that he would strive to implement 
three main programs. First, he will strive for the 
democratization process in Indonesia. According to him, 
conglomeration, corruption, and the like stem from the stalled 
democratic development in Indonesia. In this regard, Sanusi 
vowed to remain critical of government policies. "But, I remain 
constructive," he continued. He claimed to have prepared a 
number of concepts to cope with these problems.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The Jakarta municipal 
administration is going to register all stateless Chinese living 
in the city starting from May 6, in order to get accurate data 
on the group and to settle the issue of their status once and 
for all. 
  "Thus far there has never been an efficient, comprehensive 
registration of the group. Each agency in the city 
administration has its own records, which conflict with each 
other. That's why the registration is being done", Idrus, the 
deputy governor in charge of administration affairs, announced 
yesterday. 
  Nurhadi Judi, director of the Office for Developing National 
Unity at the Ministry of Home Affairs, who was also at the press 
conference, said the registration is in adherence to the 
memorandum of understanding signed by Indonesia and the People's 
Republic of China in 1992. The memorandum concerned the ethnic 
Chinese living in Indonesia without clear citizenship status. 
  "There are many Chinese here who are registered as stateless 
residents. They are not recorded as Indonesians because they 
haven't been naturalized yet. Moreover, they have no passport 
to prove that they hold Chinese citizenship," Nurhadi said. 
  According to the records at the Jakarta Population Affairs 
Office, around 27,590 stateless people of Chinese descent live 
in the capital. 
  "I believe the actual number is much higher than the figure 
we have recorded," Idrus said. 
  Idrus said the stateless Chinese to be registered are those 
who have lived here for one generation but have not yet been 
naturalized, as well as illegal immigrants. 
  Chinese residents classified as "ex-PP 10/1959" also will be 
asked to register. The PP 10/1959 is governmental regulation 
No. 10 of 1959 concerning the obligation of all ethnic Chinese 
in Indonesia to choose either Chinese or Indonesian citizenship. 
  The term "ex-PP 10/1959 was coined to refer to thos who 
opted 
for Chinese citizenship but remained in the archipelago into the 
mid 1960s. The Indonesian government faced difficulty sending 
them back to China following the break in diplomatic ties 
between the two countries after the abortive communist-led coup 
in 1965. 
  Idrus said the upcoming registration was based on a 1993 
instruction from the Ministry of Home Affairs which applied 
nationwide, except in East Timor, where all residents 
automatically became Indonesian citizen in 1976. 
  Nine provinces nationwide, North Sumatera, Riau, Jambi South 
Sumatera, West Java Central Java, East Java, East Kalimantan and 
South Sulawesi, have carried out similar registration drives. 
  In Jakarta, the provincial secretary, Harun Al Rasyid serves 
as chairman of the registration team. 
  "Everyone wanting to register should come in person," Idrus 
said. The registration will be done at district offices. 
  After being registered each person, who qualifies, can apply 
for Indonesian citizenship, while the rest will be given 
documents to announce their foreign citizenship. 
  For naturalization, each person has to have more than a 
dozen 
documents, including a birth certificate, a document certifying 
loyalty to the nation and good conduct papers, which may cost 
each individual a total of Rp [Rupiah] 647,000 (US$302.30).

<F P=106> [By Philip McClellan] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 18 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-premiers 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen said Wednesday they had 
agreed to hold peace talks in Pyongyang with the Khmer Rouge 
without preconditions, in response to an appeal by King Norodom 
Sihanouk. 
  The co-premiers had sent an official letter to the king 
"saying that we are ready to go to Pyongyang without ceasefire, 
without preconditions," Prince Ranariddh told journalists at 
Phnom Penh airport. "Let talks begin," he added. 
  He said a ceasefire that had been a precondition for holding 
the talks -- which are also to be attended by National Assembly 
chairman Chea Sim -- had blocked the peace process. 
  "We have to do something to overcome the deadlock and my 
father (King Sihanouk) said the only one thing to do is to have 
talks without a ceasefire," he added. 
  "We are going to Pyongyang because we believe that we will 
have peace and national reconciliation, otherwise we would not 
go," he said when asked if he felt optimistic. 
  Hun Sen said the talks, beginning on May 27, would be based 
on a peace plan put forward by King Sihanouk, but added that the 
government had yet to get a response from Khmer Rouge nominal 
leader Khieu Samphan regarding the proposal. 
  King Sihanouk has proposed that certain "acceptable" members 
of the Khmer Rouge be given senior cabinet posts in the 
government in exchange for giving up their zones, ceasing all 
guerrilla activities and merging their fighters with the royal 
armed forces. 
  Prince Ranariddh has downplayed Khmer Rouge guerrilla 
activities as "hit and run," but said that the rebel "threat" 
had to be stopped for the sake of the country, adding that King 
Sihanouk's proposal was the best chance for peace. 
  Asked whether he thought foreign military aid would escalate 
the Cambodian civil war, the prince said that "insecurity" was 
rife in Cambodia, and that action had to be taken against the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  But he added that weapons would not be enough and that 
Cambodia was in dire need of development and civil programs, as 
well as a restructuring of its armed forces. 
  King Sihanouk last week appealed for military aid from the 
United States, France and Australia "to save Cambodia from the 
yoke of the Khmer Rouge." 
  Prince Ranariddh confirmed Monday that the government had 
requested military support from western powers to fight the 
Khmer Rouge, a move the rebel faction has condemned as meddling 
in Cambodia's internal affairs. 
  The co-premiers were seeing off King Sihanouk who left for 
Beijing for medical treatment two weeks earlier than originally 
scheduled, citing his frustration at the failure of Cambodia's 
politicians to accept his peace plan. 
  The king Tuesday called on Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu 
Samphan and Hun Sen to bury the hatchet and proposed holding 
peace talks on May 27 at his residence in North Korea. But in 
an interview published Wednesday in the Cambodia Daily, the king 
had expressed pessimism at seeing the peace plan get off the 
ground, partly because he said Hun Sen was strongly opposed to 
"any flexibility vis a vis the Khmer Rouge." 
  The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of more than 
a million Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that 
ended when Vietnamese troops ousted them from power in late 
1978. The Khmer Rouge signed the 1991 Paris peace accords but 
refused to participate in the UN-sponsored general elections in 
1991, and have continued to wage guerrilla warfare.

<F P=106> [Speech by First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh at </F>
the second session of the first National Assembly in Phnom Penh 
on 16 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Permit me to pay my respects to the samdech 
chairman of the National Assembly, their excellencies the vice 
chairmen, excellencies, and mesdames. First of all, I would 
like to express thanks on behalf of our Royal Government of 
Cambodia [RGC] for the support just given by their excellencies 
and mesdames to the RGC's plan to redress our national economy. 
Besides, the RGC promises to to take for further study any 
well-founded suggestions you made to take concrete measures for 
their implementation. 
  As for the issue of our forests, which constitute one of the 
nation's resources, the RGC has given this maximum attention 
because not only does this issue affect the environment of the 
nation as a whole, but it also concerns the survival and future 
of Cambodia itself. The RGC has already decided to impose a 
moratorium on the export of both whole logs and processed logs 
from the Kingdom of Cambodia as of 1 April 1994. 
  The madame representing the commission concerned just now 
talked about the import-export imbalance, and there is also an 
imbalance in the national budget, which normally relies on tax 
income from our rice, rubber, and log export, especially during 
the times of Sangkum Reas Niyum. At the present, however, we 
are not in any position to export, say, our rice of which we 
even experience a serious shortage. As for our rubber, it can 
be exported but does not generate enough revenue. So, only our 
forests remain the main resource. 
  I would like, therefore, to remind the National Assembly 
that 
when UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] was here, it 
advised us to stop exporting our logs. Now, when the time has 
come for it to provide us with aid to fill our national coffer, 
when it heard that we would impose a log export moratorium, 
UNTAC tried to dissuade us from doing that. It said: Where 
would you get the money you need; why not sell your trees to get 
money for your budget? 
  Moreover, in his capacity as a member of the RGC, the state 
minister in charge of finance and economy [Sam Rangsi] supports 
the RGC's stance on the log export ban, while in his capacity as 
the minister in charge of finance and economy, he too has some 
reservations. 
  Thirdly, it should be noted that no new trees have been 
felled. Considerable amounts of already felled logs are lying in 
huge piles all over the country. If we do not take appropriate 
measures to deal with them, they can only rot and go to waste. 
This log export ban is prompted by the RGC's plan to divert the 
export of raw material into local production. This would 
generate, first, employment and, second, what you called the 
added values [two preceding words in French] to our natural 
resources. However, because of the shortage in capital 
investments, our internal markets cannot cope with the excessive 
quantities of the decomposing timber. For this reason, while the 
RGC continues to maintain the log export ban, all ministries 
concerned should survey the quantities of the already felled 
trees. Although the RGC continues to uphold the export ban, 
some exporters will always be permitted to export logs just as 
pointed out by His Excellency [H.E.] Son Chhai [MP, Siem Reap 
constituency]. 
  Briefly, the RGC must face many major issues. The first 
issue is the question of protecting the nation's environment. 
The second issue is the question of national budget, which is 
experiencing a serious imbalance or the question of trade 
imbalance. Currently, in our state the national budget relies 
mainly on tax income. So, in this regard, we do not have any 
objection to H.E. Son Chhai's call to increase the severity of 
the punishment. However, this issue has already been dealt with 
by law. Yet, should our National Assembly deem it necessary to 
pursue this matter by adding that provision, the RGC has no 
objection. We merely ask that more appropriate wording be 
reached. This is because just saying "to consolidate the 
Forestry and Wildlife Department" and adding "by meting out an 
urgent punishment" seems to be mismatched phrasing. Therefore, 
I ask the commission or H.E. [Planning Minister] Chea Chanto on 
behalf of the RGC to rearrange this sentence so that it includes 
the two conditions -- to consolidate the department and increase 
the severity of punishment -- to fight this crime. So, the RGC 
only asks for a rewording. Other than that, as a question of 
principle, the RGC has no objection. 
  H.E. Son Chhai also talked about the issue of specialists. I 
would like to inform all of you that the RGC has asked France 
and France has responded by sending their specialists to help 
the RGC compile a forestry and wildlife code to ensure a correct 
logging and reforestration policy that would conform with the 
nation's needs as well as the international norms and laws 
observed in other countries. 
  Once more I would like to inform you, excellencies and 
mesdames, that the RGC is paying maximum attention in line with 
the august idea of our revered king concerning the protection of 
our nation's natural resources and environment as part of our 
efforts to ensure the future of Cambodia, the future of our 
younger generations. 
  I take this opportunity, in my capacity as the first prime 
minister, to make some observations on the points just raised in 
its report by the commission. 
  First, on the assertion that the imbalance between 
production 
and consumption is a major problem that the entire national 
community must confront and solve and particularly the assertion 
that this imbalance is essentially caused by the insufficient 
means of production, the low level of technology, and the lack 
in human resource, I would like to inform you, excellencies and 
mesdames, that the RGC has a plan to ask the Education Ministry 
to change the aim of our national education. We must emulate 
post-World War II Germany, which needed labor to meet its 
national reconstruction needs. Therefore, the RGC will order 
the ministry concerned -- namely, the Ministry of Education -- 
to give priority to setting up vocational institutes. After 
finishing secondary education, our students should be diverted 
to receive at least three years of vocational training. If we 
fail to do that, if we continue to encourage our students to 
further their study in colleges or universities, we will surely 
have graduates in the forms of engineers, scholars, and doctors 
with substandard academic degrees. In real life, these graduates 
will be incapable of finding jobs although many investors have 
vacancies to fill. So, there will be a serious social problem 
in the future, and we will not be able to meet the demands of 
our nation. For this reason, the RGC once again asks the 
Education Ministry to effect a reorientation. Let us compare 
Germany and France. France at this moment is experiencing a 
serious unemployment problem whereas Germany is able to solve 
this same problem. So is Japan. Japan and Germany after the 
war took the correct steps in national educaction. 
  Based on this reasoning, the RGC will ask friendly countries 
who wish to help us to do so by creating as many institutes as 
possible for vocational training to meet the demands of the 
country and the needs of foreign investors. If we can provide 
only what they call low-skilled labor, Cambodia will remain poor 
forever while our neighbors will prosper. For this reason, we 
must start with producing the so-called low-skilled labor first 
and in the very short future we must have the ability to produce 
the so-called finished-skilled labor before reaching the state 
of labor category achieved by Singapore, which is called 
high-tech labor. 
  Nonetheless, we are able to provide the low-skilled labor 
now. Cambodia has very great potential. It has been said that 
the cheapest labor in Southeast Asia can be found in Indonesia, 
where the lowest wage is $68 to $70 a month. In Cambodia, our 
monthly wage is only $35 to $40. So, our labor is the cheapest. 
It is almost half of what is earned in Indonesia. For this 
reason, we must attract as many foreign invesments as possible. 
  Regarding this investment issue raised by the commission, 
the 
RGC has already drafted a bill on investment in Cambodia. The 
RGC will submit this bill for cabinet approval and will submit 
it for the National Assembly's scrutiny and passage as soon as 
possible. I met with foreign diplomats and major would-be 
investors. They clearly told us that our current problem is not 
the Khmer Rouge. What stops them from coming in now is the 
absence in our country of a legal investment law. We have 
created distrust in them. So, they have proposed that we pass 
an investment law as soon as possible. We have already drafted 
such a bill, and some of those foreign experts to whom we have 
submitted it for examination have assured us that if such an 
investment law is promulgated, we will be the star of Asia 
[preceding three words in English]. We have drawn up this 
investment law with outside help. We have modeled it after the 
laws of many other countries. We also studied the stipulations 
of the IMF. We have made it better than others. If we do not 
do that, no one -- no major investor -- will come to invest in 
our country. They would rather go to Vietnam. For this reason, 
the National Assembly will have to study and pass this 
investment law as soon as possible. The investors have told us 
they are not afraid of the Khmer Rouge. If they have not yet 
come in it is because no investmment law is in effect. 
Furthermore, they have told us that Cambodia is too slow in 
making decisions. Who is responsible for making these 
decisions? Some firms have submitted their applications as long 
as 18 months ago already. These are major firms such as 
Germany's Siemens and others. We keep holding endless 
discussions and debates on their applications. So, it is not 
the question of insecurity but the question of our lack of an 
investment law, lack of sufficient guarantees, and lack of 
ability to make prompt decisions. If we continue to be as 
deficient as we are now, no countries will have the patience to 
wait; they will surely take their investments elsewhere. This 
is a point that I would like to impress upon you. 
  Moreover, concerning this investment matter, sometimes it is 
smart to ignore a few insignificant mistakes committed by the 
investors. We must not hesitate to let major firms of 
international standing, those coming from big countries, proceed 
with their investments in our country even if to a small extent 
they affect our own interests. In the long run, Cambodia can 
only benefit from such companies. For example, if major firms 
from America, France, England, Japan, or Australia invest in our 
country we will not have to go around begging for their 
assistance. They will automatically help us because they will 
need to protect their interests in our kingdom. So, the 
interests will be mutual. This is a response to the question 
raised by Madame who just now said that we are lacking in human 
resources. I say we have the human resources. What we need to 
do is to transform this human resource, and make it meet the 
demands of the nation and of foreign investors. The RGC has the 
plan to redirect our national education from now on. 
  On the other hand, the madame representative's assertion 
that the lack of balance between import and export is noteworthy 
is most correct. In the past we had agriculture as our asset. 
Now the RGC is making great efforts in its water conservancy 
and irrigation policy, restoring ditches and canals, selecting 
good seeds, and providing farmers with fertilizers. However, if 
in dealing with agriculture we keep relying on traditional 
methods, we will not be able to achieve much. So, the new 
objective of the RGC is also reorientation. We are aiming our 
focus on industrial crops. 
  Talking of industrial crops, the first thing that comes to 
mind is rubber plantations that I and Samdech Hun Sen agreed the 
other day to set aside. I would like however to inform their 
excellencies and mesdames who are the representatives of our 
state and nation that the new objective of the RGC is to develop 
industrial crops. For example, in agriculture today's Vietnam 
has become a bigger coffee producing nation than the African 
nations. Why can Cambodia not do the same? What is the 
difference between the two sides of the political border? There 
is no natural border, of course. If the land is good for coffee 
in Vietnam it should be good for coffee in Cambodia, too. 
  Another crop is the oilseed, soy beans, or [word 
indistinct]. 
The competent departments are studying possibilities and several 
major firms have been prepared to invest in this field. 
  Yet another industrial crop is the castor-oil plant. We have 
a large market for this crop, in particular Thailand, which has 
just built a large refinery to extract this type of oil. 
However, Thailand has no land to grow this crop. It has 
contacted us and leased some 200,000 hectares of our land for 
the planting of this new crop. 
  So, in summary, we must change our objective and focus on 
industrial crops. If we continue to stick to our traditional 
crops, we will not be able to meet our demands both at the 
present and in the future. The RGC plans to build an assembly 
plant for tractors, such as Massey-Fergusson. There are many 
regions like the plains around the Tonle Sap lake where during 
the Sangkum Reas Niyum era there were as many as 200 tractors 
engaged in the cultivating the floating rice. Now there are 
only about 60 to 70 tractors for this purpose. The local 
farmers have appealed for somebody to import additional 
tractors. I would like to inform you that we are going to 
borrow money and use it to assemble or produce these tractors 
for sale to the people at low prices so that they can cultivate 
the 30,000 hectares which even without the use of fertilizers 
yield from 2.5 to 3 metric tons per hectare. This is a great 
yield, and it is something that the kingdom can do and will do 
in the near future. 
  The imbalance of our national budget, as I said before, 
results from the fact that our national budget relies on two 
main sources of incomes: taxes and foreign aid. H.E. Chea 
Chanto said just now that foreign countries cannot help us 
forever, and we cannot depend entirely on our tax incomes. 
However, as I have just informed you, there are means to beef 
up our national budget. Up to this point, the RGC has been able 
to balance the budget in terms of service although in terms of 
construction we still incur a budget imbalance. This, however, 
should be seen as an achievement by the RGC. 
  Besides, it was proposed to increase the national product 
from 2.5 percent to 8 percent in 1994 if possible. Normally, we 
need a bigger growth because ours is a newly developing country. 
A growth of 7 or 8 percent is seen as a natural development in 
Southeast Asia. Thailand's growth remains at 9 percent. In 
1993 we recorded a 7-percent growth. This year -- H.E. Sam 
Rangsi is here to confirm it -- maybe we will be able to reach 
8-percent growth. Considering the needs of our nation, an 
8-percent growth is insufficient, and we need much more than 
that. However, under the current circumstances, we cannot do 
better than that. But this 8-percent rate is the average growth 
rate of countries in our Southeast Asia. 
  The RGC is paying attention to the raising of silk worms. 
The Agriculture Ministry is closely following development in 
this area because presently we are importing silk from foreign 
countries. However, I have asked our people why they did not 
grow mulberry trees. They said there was no need to plant these 
mulberry trees to raise silk worms because it was much more 
convenient and much cheaper to buy silk from abroad. This was a 
problem. We have decided that we must grow mulberry trees to 
raise silk worms, but the weavers insisted that they did not 
need to plant them because it was cheaper and faster to buy silk 
from Vietnam and, to top it, this silk from Vietnam was of 
better quality. However, we must solve this problem for the 
people. 
  Now let us talk about industry, trade, and tourism. 
Concerning the issue of factories, I would like to inform you 
that the RGC has a plan to privatize the nation's industrial 
enterprises. However, there are a few national enterprises that 
are considered to be strategic. The RGC cannot privatize all 
our state industrial enterprises. A few will remain under the 
control of the RGC because they are regarded as strategic. 
  Concerning the private factories, I would like to inform you 
of this: Some Japanese wish to rent our state-owned factories, 
but they have asked the RGC to seal off the border and stop the 
smuggling of similar goods from abroad. The Japanese has asked 
us to set up a customs wall [two preceding words repeated in 
English]. This is because should they invest in our country and 
produce consumer goods for local consumption and export, 
especially for local consumption, and should we be unable to 
seal off our border, the factories in the country would not be 
able to compete with the same goods, the same products that can 
be sold at much lower prices because of mass production and 
higher technology. As a result, our factories will be forced to 
close their doors one after another. 
  There is also the issue of duties and profit taxes. We are 
not resorting to a protectionist policy, but we have to find a 
way to enable the local factories to compete with the same 
products imported from abroad. Moreover, the imported products 
that outsell our local products are made abroad. What we need 
-- even if we make only a small profit -- is the employment 
opportunities for our people. This should be a priority. 
Without such opportunities, our people will become poorer and 
poorer. Consequently, the RGC would like to make the following 
plea to you, excellencies and mesdames: If you feel that we are 
imposing too low taxes, you should realize that the job 
opportunities given to the unemployed populace should more than 
compensate for the relatively small incomes into the national 
coffer. Employment is a priority to be immediately solved 
otherwise we will be confronted with a serious social problem in 
Cambodia in the very near future. 
  Furthermore, there is the issue of electric supply. Not only 
are we experiencing a massive power shortage but the people of 
Cambodia are paying a much higher price for their electricity. 
Ours is not one time but five times higher than the electricity 
sold anywhere else in the world. So, despite the cheap labor, 
products made in our country remain costly because our 
electricity is very expensive. For this reason, the RGC has 
another goal. We will not just set up power plants, but our 
strategy is that our electricity will rely on water, on 
hydroelectric sources, because we have so many possibilities in 
this area and many international organizations, countries, and 
companies are prepared to help us in this field. Without 
speaking of dams on the Mekong River, just the dams to be built 
on other rivers throughout the country would produce 17,000 
megawatts. This production far exceeds the needs in our kingdom. 
  Another area that we should talk about -- which madame the 
representative has raised just now -- is tourism. This is a 
major issue, an important issue. Almost every day the RGC is 
studying ways to exploit tourism. However, it is not possible 
to deal with tourism without taking into consideration the 
question of security as a whole. The issue of prices in our 
country must also be tackled. Our hotels and restaurants are 
very expensive compared to those in our neighboring countries. 
The RGC therefore has a plan to help reduce to the maximum 
capital necessary in this vital field of tourism. The RGC, 
despite some shortcomings, is working to restore not only the 
airport in Siem Reap but also the Pochentong airport. Our 
Pochentong airport is incapable of taking in large- bodied 
aircraft of the Boeing-747 type. This weakness has led many 
potential tourists to go to neighboring countries instead. 
These neighboring countries are making profit at the expense of 
all of us Cambodians. For this reason, the RGC has an urgent 
plan to build a new runway at the same Pochentong site. This 
new runway will have the international standard length of 3,600 
meters. Its construction will be finished within two to two and 
a half years and it will allow Boeing-747 planes to land. 
Otherwise, there would be no end to the so-called bottleneck 
[preceding word in French]. The RGC also has a plan to build 
another terminal [preceding word in French] to be completed 
within two to two and a half years at Pochentong. 
  Concerning the issue of the airport in Siem Reap just raised 
by the commission, I would like to say that we will not permit 
large aircraft like the Boeing-737's or Airbus-300's to land on 
the Siem Reap runway although this runway is capable of 
accommodating these planes. This is because we fear that the 
landing tremor might shake up and damage our ancient temples, 
such as Angkor Wat. The RGC therefore has decided not to permit 
large jet aircraft to land at the Siem Reap airport, but we are 
going to restore this Siem Reap airport, and in the future we 
will find means to build another airport some 30 to 40 km away 
from Siem Reap city. In the meantime we must permit small 
propeller-driven planes to shuttle between Phnom Penh and Siem 
Reap. 
  In this field of tourism, the RGC has a plan to open up 
Sihanoukville and turn it into Asia's largest tourist site if 
possible in the future. This is because we have many more 
conditions favorable to us to do just that than any other 
country. The RGC has also already decided to build another 
international airport in Sihanoukville. All of that, in 
principle, is good enough to bring about success in the tourist 
field. 
  Briefly, we accept all the proposals or observations of the 
commission concerning the restoration of roads as a priority 
task. As you know, National Routes 12, 13, 18, 19, and so on are 
receiving close attention from the RGC. In the name of the RGC, 
we have just visited Koh Kong, Ratanakiri, and Mondolkiri and we 
talked about this priority issue there. However, we currently 
lack the budgetary funds, and these routes need considerable 
funds. Nevertheless, the RGC will do its best to restore them 
at all costs, especially the routes linking Phnom Penh with the 
eastern and western regions of the country. This is because of 
the concept that development without roads is not possible. In 
two or three provinces, such as Mondolkiri, Ratanakiri, and 
Stung Treng, there are huge natural resources, and these 
provinces are very lightly populated. Mondolkiri's population is 
20,000 and Ratanakiri's is 60,000. Several big firms plan to 
invest in our country in growing industrial crops. So, this is 
a great guarantee for the future of our kingdom. What the RGC 
asks for is merely this: to a number of youths who seem to be 
restive over the issues of security, or the lack of it, and 
development, I would like to take this opportunity to remind 
them that before the elections H.E. Lee Kwan Yew, former prime 
minister of Singapore, told our august and most revered king 
father that after the war comes to an end and when there is 100 
percent security Cambodia will need at least 10 more years just 
to become equal to what it was under Sangkum Reas Niyum. 
  Mind you, we will need 10 years not to catch up with 
Singapore but just to be as good as when we were under Sangkum 
Reas Niyum. The RGC is now only eight months old. Therefore, 
you should not pass judgment on us for what we have done in only 
eight months. That is not 10 years with total security. We are 
just eight months old. Therefore, I ask the respected National 
Assembly to kindly allow the RGC to continue working with the 
limited resources at its disposal to lead the nation for a 
little while longer. Please consider my request. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Vithun: "It Is Time for the Government To </F>
Firm Up Its Legitimate Authority"] 
  [Text] In light of the latest developments, it is 
apparently time for the royal government to firm up its 
legitimate authority to stimulate the people's confidence; 
otherwise, it will face scores of complicated problems and even 
difficulties in its existence. 
  Everyone knows that so far, there has been a tendency 
seemingly to tie up the government's limbs, preventing it from 
doing anything while the Khmer Rouge continues its violation and 
destruction against innocent people. 
  Analysts of the Cambodian situation say that the government 
has suffered a serious defeat in its psychological warfare. 
When it counterattacks the Khmer Rouge in the wake of the 
latter's onslaught, the government instead has been accused of 
being a warmonger. It is certain that defeat in the 
psychological war can lead the government to other failures. It 
is also certain that only after the government suffers a real 
defeat will the people realize that they, themselves, are the 
real losers; however, it then will be too late. This being the 
case, it is a must for the government to change this situation 
urgently by making the people clearly understand that the 
government's victory is also the victory of each of them. 
  It is ironic that the Khmer Rouge and its supporters, who 
oppose the government, are able to live in government-controlled 
regions throughout the country. Nevertheless, the Khmer 
Rouge-held areas are completely safe -- there are neither Khmer 
Rouge opponents nor demonstrations calling for an end to the 
nonsensical Khmer Rouge war. In view of this, the government is 
facing two problems, namely the problem of the Khmer Rouge 
outside and the problem of the Khmer Rouge inside. 
  It is expected that in "the step toward reinforcing its 
legitimate authority," the government will begin to crack down 
on corruption which is most abhorrent to the people in general. 
Along with this, it should restrengthen its police, army, 
guards, and state authorities in order to effectively ensure 
security, order, and safety in society and to circumvent the 
Khmer Rouge's sabotage activities. This is part of the earnest 
request of the people. 
  Another issue of life and death is that if it does not want 
to dissolve itself, the government, with the massive strength of 
the two major political parties, should review the alliance 
between the two parties by taking into consideration the 
nation's interests above all. 
  It is perfectly rational that the government should firm up 
its legitimate authority at a time when the Khmer Rouge is 
consolidating its clout against the law. Somehow, what is most 
important is that the government should be in a quest for the 
people's support as well.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 17 May (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal Government of 
Cambodia, on Monday, 16 May, rejected a report alleging that the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] had taken control of Mongkolborei, a town 
located in northwestern Cambodia. 
  During a conversation with journalists following the 
inauguration of an artificial limb-making center in Phnom Penh, 
the prince indicated that the guerrillas had destroyed a bridge 
and an administrative office of Mongkolborei District, but it 
was just a "lightning" operation. 
  The radio of the Khmer Rouge affirmed that three columns of 
guerrillas had attacked government positions on 15 May near the 
Mongkolborei bridge in the town's market and along the river 
south of the town on National Route 5. 
  According to the radio, the "liberation" of Mongkolborei 
enables the Khmer Rouge to control the transport and 
communications between Battambang and Sisophon and between 
Sisophon and Poipet. 
  The radio also affirmed that on 14 May the guerrillas had 
occupied Sangkum Thmei District in Preah Vihear Province, north 
of Mongkolborei.

<F P=106> [Station editorial: "Why Did the Hanoi Communist Vietnamese </F>
Blatantly Declare That They Want To Negotiate the Problem of 
Cambodian-Vietnamese Border with Their Lackey, the Two-Headed 
Government? This Is To Legitimize Their Actions of Cutting Off 
and Turning Tens of Thousands of Square Kilometers of Cambodian 
Territory Into Their Territory Between 1979 and 1990"] 
  [Text] It should be recalled that the Cambodian-Vietnamese 
border, like those with Cambodia's other neighbors, has been 
legally defined in accordance with international law. The 
1/100,000 map drawn between 1933 and 1953 established Cambodia's 
border and territorial integrity that can be in no way subject 
to violation. Between 1963 and 1969, the border was 
internationally recognized. Nguyen Huu Tho, chairman of the 
South Vietnam Liberation Front, and Pham Van Dong, SRV prime 
minister, issued statements on 31 May 1967 and 3 March 1967 
declaring their solemn recognition of Cambodia's territorial 
integrity within its boundary defined by the 1/100,000 map. 
That being the case and according to international law, the 
communist Vietnamese have no right whatsoever to propose talks 
to review the Cambodian-Vietnamese border issue. They can never 
review it. They have to abide by international law, observe the 
border between Cambodia and Vietnam, and respect Cambodia's 
territorial integrity of land and sea. 
  The 23 October 1991 Paris agreement clearly reminded Vietnam 
and other countries of their duty and commitment to respect 
territorial integrity. The accord unambiguously defined that 
all agreements or treaties that affect Cambodia's territorial 
integrity and sovereignty should be considered null and void. 
So now, why has the communist Vietnamese called for talks on 
the Cambodian-Vietnamese border issue with the two heads 
[Ranariddh and Hun Sen]? The communist Vietnamese's goal is to 
legitimize the tens of thousands of square kilometers of 
Cambodia's land and maritime territories that they have cut off 
and occupied between 1979 and 1990 in accordance with treaties 
and agreements they concluded with their lackey puppets. Should 
they be able to legitimize their actions of cutting off and 
occupying part of the Cambodian territory, then they will 
continue this stratagem to swallow and incorporate Cambodia into 
the late Ho Chi Minh's federation in a legal fashion and through 
a demographic war. Vietnam has employed all manner of maneuvers 
to achieve its strategy of turning Cambodia into a second 
Kampuchea Kraom. 
  The Cambodian nation and people are fully entitled to 
declare 
all agreements and treaties the traitorous communist Vietnamese 
puppets concluded with the communist Vietnamese between 1979 and 
1990 as null and void. They earnestly demand that the communist 
Vietnamese return all the land and maritime territories they 
have cut off and occupied to Cambodia.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Uzbekistan President Islam 
Karimov said Wednesday [18 May] that his central Asian nation 
and Japan can both profit from increased economic cooperation. 
  Karimov, who is on a four-day visit to Japan, said at a news 
conference that Japan can use advanced technology and know-how 
to help Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, develop its vast 
mineral resources such as gold, copper and oil. 
  "We are having talks with Japanese leaders of various fields 
here. I think bilateral economic cooperation will increase at a 
rapid pace," he said. 
  As one effort to promote economic cooperation, Karimov said 
Uzbekistan is ready to open air links with Japan. 
  In talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday, 
Karimov 
said that both leaders discussed the possibility of opening an 
air route between the two nations. 
  On domestic issues, Karimov said Uzbekistan, which became 
independent in August 1991, will hold a parliamentary election 
in December to elect 150 new legislators. 
  Rejecting the view that his government has oppressed 
opposition groups, Karimov said under the constitution all 
existing parties in Uzbekistan can take part in the election, to 
which he said the United Nations did not raise any objection. 
  The president also stressed the importance of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as having served to 
prevent the former Soviet republics from falling into civil war. 
  "I see the future of CIS depends on its power to integrate 
(its members) economically," Karimov said. 
  Karimov will leave for home on Thursday after visiting the 
ancient capital of Kyoto in western Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
voiced support Tuesday [17 May] night for economic and 
democratic reform efforts in Uzbekistan led by President Islam 
Karimov, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  In a meeting with Karimov, Hata also pledged $5 million 
worth 
of medical equipment and vaccines for children as emergency 
humanitarian assistance, bringing the total amount of Japanese 
medical assistance to about $15 million, the officials said. 
  In the hour-long meeting, followed by dinner at the prime 
minister's official residence, Hata told Karimov that Japan 
gives high marks to the president's "original" reform efforts 
which place importance on stability in central Asia, they said. 
  Japan wants to support such efforts as much as possible, 
Hata 
was quoted as saying. 
  Karimov, who is on a four-day visit through Thursday, told 
Hata he is pursuing efforts to shift to a market-oriented 
economy and to achieve democracy in an original way, based on 
five principles, the officials said. 
  The principles are to place priority on economy rather than 
politics, state involvement in solving problems to achieve a 
shift towards market-oriented economy, the reign of law, 
priority on social policies, and shifting towards 
market-oriented economy step by step, karimov said. 
  Uzbekistan wants to join the world economy as soon as 
possible, karimov told Hata, while calling for Japanese support 
in projects to develop Uzbekistan's natural resources, according 
to the officials. 
  Karimov invited Hata to visit Uzbekistan, the officials 
said. 
  Karimov also told Hata that interest toward Japan is growing 
in Uzbekistan and that most of the 22 million uzbek population 
knows Japan's history and culture, with some universities 
offering Japanese language education. 
  Hata said Japan wants to cooperate in promoting Japanese 
education and wants to study sending teachers there or inviting 
students to Japan. 
  Also during the meeting, Karimov handed Hata an album which 
included pictures of graves of Japanese soldiers detained in 
uzbekistan after World War II, the officials said. 
  Before their meeting, Hata and Karimov signed a joint 
statement outlining the framework for future bilateral relations. 
  The statement says Japan and Uzbekistan agreed that 
"expansion of political dialogue is a beneficial and effective 
way to promote bilateral relations and affirmed the importance 
of exchanging opinions on matters of mutual interest, including 
international and regional problems." 
  The two countries also confirmed that treaties and 
international agreements concluded between Japan and the former 
Soviet Union have been applied and remain in effect between 
Japan and Uzbekistan "with the exception of those which cannot 
meaningfully exist" between the two nations, it said. 
  The statement also said uzbekistan "expressed the hope that 
Japan would become a permanent member of the UN Security Council 
and fulfill its relevant responsibilities." 
  Japan and Uzbekistan also shared concern over environmental 
problems in Uzbekistan exemplified by those involving the Aral 
Sea and agreed on the importance of environmental protection, 
the statement said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Wednesday [18 May] urged parliamentary cooperation in 
speeding up the process of enacting an electorate redistricting 
bill so that an upcoming general election could be contested 
under the single-seat constituency system. 
  "Although I can invoke my authority to call a general 
election even under the current multiseat constituency system 
still in place, it is desirable for the election to be contested 
under the new system," Hata said. 
  Hata made the remark in a question-and-answer session in the 
House of Representatives Budget Committee. 
  Although the Diet legislated in January a package of 
electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system 
for the 511- member lower chamber with a mix of single-seat 
electorates and proportional representation, it requires the 
passage of the demarcation bill to allow the next election to be 
lawfully contested under the single-seat system. 
  At present, a government-appointed panel of experts are 
speeding up the task of splitting the nation's multiseat 
constituencies into 300 single-seat electorates. 
  Hata said, "I am aware that some citizens are demanding an 
early holding of the election to seek a public verdict on 
politicians in view of the fact that my new administration has 
been reduced to a minority government." 
  However, Hata said the legislation of the redistricting bill 
must precede the general election, saying, "it is crucial to 
firmly establish the (single-seat) system." 
  "The public feels that politics is in a hopeless situation 
and their feelings have caused low voter turnout ratios in 
various elections," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Wednesday [18 May] Japan will maintain its easier 
credit policy to bolster the weak economy, brushing aside any 
possible policy changes in response to overnight U.S. rate hikes. 
  "Monetary policy must reflect that nation's economic 
conditions," Fujii told reporters and noted he had heard the 
U.S. rate hikes were "part of measures to prevent inflation." 
  Citing Japan's yet-weak economy, Fujii said that he 
"believes 
the Bank of Japan will continue spreading (the effects) of low 
interest rates." 
  The central bank has been guiding the key overnight call 
rate 
over past weeks to record lows through ample funding operations. 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve board raised the official discount 
rate and its target federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points 
Tuesday. 
  The Fed in a statement said the hikes were "designed to 
maintain favorable trends in inflation and thereby sustain the 
economic expansion." 
  Regarding currency rates, Fujii declined to comment on 
exchange levels, saying he is "quietly watching." 
  The dollar remained lower despite the U.S. rate hike, with 
Tokyo dealers saying that the move was already factored in by 
the market. 
  Speculation surfaced last week in exchange markets that the 
leading industrialized nations have made a secret accord to 
cooperate on credit policy in line with market interventions to 
boost the dollar. 
  Germany's Bundesbank cut the key rate last week with other 
European central banks following suit, and the Bank of Japan 
continued sending short-term market rates lower. As expected, 
the U.S. Fed raised the key rate. 
  Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other countries help 
the 
dollar rise.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Eijiro Hata, minister of 
international trade and industry, Wednesday [18 May] took a 
cautious stance on possible implementation of measures to 
safeguard textile imports. 
  The MITI minister told reporters that rules are necessary to 
implement internationally accepted measures. 
  But he said it would be ideal if there is no necessity to 
implement such measures. 
  Hata was commenting on a set of rules for the implementation 
of measures to guard textile import levels, recommended by a 
government advisory panel on Tuesday. 
  The panel proposed the step be used under certain conditions 
as a way to protect the struggling Japanese textile industry 
against massive textile exports by China and other developing 
countries. 
  A discriminatory curb on textile imports under the 
multifiber 
agreement (MFA) will be phased out by 2005 under the recently 
concluded Uruguay Round global trade accord. 
  Japan's implementation of such a step amid the global shift 
toward free trade could draw international criticism as a return 
to protectionism.

  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel 
on Tuesday [17 May] proposed a set of rules for invoking a 
discriminatory curb on textile imports under the Multifiber 
Agreement (MFA). 
  It is "desirable" to take necessary measures to remove the 
negative effects of rapid textile imports on Japan's textile 
industry under the internationally accepted accord, said the 
Textile Industry Council, an advisory body to the trade minister. 
  The move would give the struggling textile industry time to 
structurally regroup in an effort to realize profits, the 
council said. 
  But possible negative effects from the step, including 
inconvenience to Japanese textile consumers and slack innovative 
efforts in the industry, should also be considered, it said. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will work 
out a guideline for invoking the MFA measure by fall, based on 
the council's recommendation, a ministry official said. 
  The recommendation does not mean Japan will begin stepping 
up 
safeguard measures on textile imports, in a departure from a 
restraint policy on the issue, the official said. 
  The guideline is designed to enhance "the transparency" of 
the MFA procedure, which has been "very ambiguous," the official 
said. 
  The MFA, which was introduced in 1974 and has been 
repeatedly 
extended, is intended to protect Japan and Western industrial 
countries, major textile importers, from possible damage to 
their domestic textile industries due to massive textile exports 
by China and other developing countries. 
  The safeguard rule proposed by the MITI council calls for 
Japan to activate the step after "technically" evaluating the 
seriousness of the impact of foreign products on the domestic 
industry. 
  Specifically, the council recommended using the ratio of 
import penetration, or imports divided by an aggregate of 
production and net imports, as well as import growth. 
  As a way to gauge the severity of damage, it proposed 
comprehensive assessment of such domestic factors collected in 
the past three years, as employment, output drop, wage levels, 
product prices, sales, investment, inventory levels and 
profitability. 
  A cause and effect relation should be also proved between 
import growth and actual damage or the risk of damage, the 
council said. 
  The council cited prevention of a sudden increase in 
unemployment as a positive effect of the textile safeguard, as 
well as supporting the domestic industry's restructuring efforts. 
  As minus effects, the council pointed out slow correction of 
a textiles price gap between the domestic market and abroad. 
  With invocation of protectionist measures like the MFA, 
Japan 
may draw global criticism at a time when the step is doomed to 
be phased out under the recently concluded Uruguay round of 
multilateral trade accords, the council said. 
  The Uruguay Round trade framework calls for total abolition 
of the textile safeguard in 2005. 
  The council said the safeguard, when invoked, should include 
a measure to ensure a certain level of imports -- no smaller 
than imports in the previous year during the first year of the 
safeguard's application and with a minimum 6 percent growth in 
the second year and after. 
  The import floor is designed to minimize negative effects on 
Japanese textile consumers, the council said. 
  Invocation of the textile safeguard should not last longer 
than three years, it said. 
  Moreover, it should be phased out by 2005 under the Uruguay 
Round accord, the council said. 
  The MITI official said the ministry will select textile 
items 
subject to the safeguard measure in the blueprint, noting that a 
blanket application is not desirable. 
  Both the United States and Europe have resorted to the MFA 
scheme frequently over the past 20 years as an effective way of 
protecting their domestic industries. 
  About 80 percent of textile imports in the U.S. are covered 
by the mfa and about 50 percent in the European union. 
  China has been the largest textle exporter to Japan, with 
Japan's purchases from that country accounting for nearly 50 
percent of the total imports. 
  The MITI official said the ministry will send a ranking 
official to China later this month to explain the recommended 
rules for invoking the MFA. 
  The Chinese Government is moving to introduce a voluntary 
curb on textile exports to Japan in order to prevent Tokyo from 
invoking the MFA. 
  The MITI source said last week Beijing recently sent MITI a 
letter stating it will adopt the voluntary cap.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- The House of Representatives 
plenary session approved a 10.89 trillion yen stopgap 
supplementary budget Wednesday [18 May] and sent it to the House 
of Councillors. 
  The supplementary budget submitted earlier by the government 
will extend for 40 days a 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 
trillion yen that is nearing expiration. 
  The revised stopgap budget totaling 21.94 trillion yen for 
90 
days was endorsed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting in the 
morning. 
  The rare supplement on a stopgap budget -- the first since 
fiscal 1990 -- followed the continued political turmoil 
involving the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and the selection of Premier Tsutomu Hata. 
  Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget 
for 
fiscal 1994, submitted to the Diet unusually late on March 4, 
were finally begun Tuesday, but uncertainties over a speedy 
passage still prevail with the ruling coalition holding a 
minority of Diet seats. 
  It normally takes about two months for a full budget to pass 
through the Diet.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Kohei Murayama] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- With the long-delayed Diet 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget finally getting under 
way, the Finance Ministry is stepping up its campaign to 
pressure legislators into an early passage of the bill. 
  Ministry leaders have started to openly admit their fears 
that a further delay would put a damper on the economy, which 
has recently shown improvements and been relieved from a further 
rise in the yen. 
  "I can't deny that a long delay will affect the economy," 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a press meeting held 
Tuesday [17 May] just before the Diet started its budget 
deliberations. 
  The day before, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito made 
headlines by spelling out his concerns at a usually vague 
regular news conference. 
  The full 73 trillion yen budget for the year that started 1 
April faced a Diet impasse over former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's questionable loans from the scandal-tainted Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking group. 
  During the stalemate, the government adopted a 50-day 
provisional budget in March worth 11 trillion yen, effective 
from 1 April, to bridge the spending gap. That stopgap budget 
will expire on Friday. 
  The Diet deadlock continued in April, with the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party stubbornly pursuing the loan issue and 
causing Hosokawa to resign. 
  To further bridge the delay, the government endorsed last 
week a 40-day supplement to the provisional budget. 
  Both Fujii and Saito said that fresh public projects and 
other outlays related to new policy measures cannot be included 
in the stopgap budget, and Saito stressed, "that's why we are 
calling for early Diet passage" of the full budget. 
  Economists said the budget has become crucial to Japan's 
economic recovery during the halt in the yen's rise, and warned 
that economy-stimulating spending included in the February 15.25 
trillion yen package will dry up by the end of June. 
  Jesper Koll, chief economist at S.G. Warburg Securities 
(Japan) Inc., said the stimulus package helped Japan's real 
gross national product (GDP) to grow 0.1 percent in calender 
1994, and without it real GDP would have contracted 1.8 percent. 
  He added that Japan needs to continue bolstering the economy 
with fresh spending even after the package-related outlays 
disappear. 
  Diet budget deliberations usually last about two months, 
roughly the time frame necessary to have the budget passed by 
the end of June. 
  The LDP and the Social Democratic Party, which split from 
the 
ruling coalition when the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
was formed, have said they will try to ensure the budget is 
passed by the end of the current Diet session on 29 June. 
  Many economists say there is no guarantee that goal can be 
realized, given all the current political turmoil and with 
Hata's coalition holding only a minority in the diet. 
  Koll said, "foreign institutional investors have completely 
lost faith in Japan's budget and they are set to sell off 
Japanese stocks if a clear direction is not in sight by around 
15 June." 
  This would mean a major setback in Japanese stocks that have 
been underpinned by foreign buying, he said. 
  From around that time, market attention will shift to the 
bank of Japan with a cut in the official discount rate becoming 
the only way to buoy the economy, Koll said. 
  Meanwhile, bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, in his 
latest news conference, called for Hata to use "leadership" to 
push through the budget.

  Citing the lingering uncertainties, a Finance Ministry 
official told reporters the 40-day extension period was timed so 
that the stopgap budget expires when the current Diet session 
ends on June 29. 
  As in the initial provisional budget, the supplement 
earmarks 
necessary minimum expenditures to keep administrative bodies 
functioning and excludes public projects in new policy areas. 
  Outlays related to public works are increased by 1.07 
trillion yen to 3.84 trillion yen, about three-sevenths of 
spending included in the full budget. 
  Minimum expenses in labor, operations and other 
administrative expenses are set at 25 percent of the full 
budget, up from 14 percent in the initial stopgap budget. 
  Among other major outlays, the supplement boosts social 
welfare spending by 1.48 trillion yen to 3.69 trillion yen, and 
raises tax grants to local governments by 3.64 trillion yen to 
7.30 trillion yen. 
  In revenues, the ministry estimates an additional 2.92 
trillion yen to a total 6.75 trillion yen in the 90-day period, 
including 1.93 trillion yen more in tax income to 3.15 trillion 
yen and 910 billion yen more in bond issuance to 3.38 trillion 
yen. 
  To cover an estimated revenue shortfall of 15.20 trillion 
yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term 
treasury securities if necessary. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told reporters after the 
cabinet meeting, "I can't deny that a long delay will affect the 
economy." 
  But he stressed that the government decided on the revised 
stopgap budget to "minimize" adverse effects and is calling for 
early passage of the full budget. 
  Meanwhile, some economists warned that the 
economy-stimulating outlays earmarked in February's pump-priming 
package will dry up by the end of June. 
  The Japanese economy is recently showing improvements on the 
heels of the fiscal measures, but without fresh outlays, it 
could suffer another setback, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA) said Tuesday [17 May] it is setting up an advisory panel 
to review Japan's 430 trillion yen 10-year public works spending 
plan. 
  The 22-member review panel will be headed by Mitsuhide 
Yamaguchi, who just stepped down as head of the Export-Import 
Bank of Japan and is widely expected to be named to head the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The panel is to meet about five times, 
starting Thursday, and draw up its report next month. 
  The review is expected to call for boosting the spending on 
"social infrastructure" projects, as well as the traditional 
roads and bridges schemes, in part to meet U.S. demands that 
Japan boost domestic demand to help curb its huge trade surplus. 
  EPA chief Yoshio Terasawa acknowledged that the committee 
seems dominated by ex-bureaucrats, such as Yamaguchi, a former 
vice finance minister, with only a handful of genuinely 
private-sector choices. 
  "Anyway, the lineup has been decided," Terasawa told a 
regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
"They're all excellent individuals and I'm sure they'll do a 
fine job." 
  On deregulation measures, which the government has also 
promised by the end of June in a market-opening package, 
Terasawa expressed a sense of urgency, saying the plans must be 
sketched out by June 20 to meet the deadline. 
  "There's really no time. It's down to the wire," he said. 
  He said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and related ministers 
strongly expressed their will to forge deregulation measures on 
time, during a special meeting before the cabinet meeting. But 
Terasawa acknowledged that no specifics emerged.

  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- The Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) proposed Tuesday [17 May] that an 
advisory council for the prime minister be established to study 
drastic reforms of government-backed financial services, 
including postal savings and postal insurance. 
  The top Japanese business organization made the proposal in 
a 
report on reforming Japan's government-backed financial system. 
  It said a further expansion of the postal savings and postal 
insurance services should be avoided since they receive various 
forms of government protection. 
  The report also said Japan's future monetary policies should 
be based more on the nation's money supply and land and other 
asset values, not just interest rates and price trends as at 
present. 
  It offered trial calculations on the effects of the money 
supply on economic growth and rises in land and stock prices. 
  The report noted the money supply grew at an annual rate of 
more than 10 percent in the "bubble economy" years between 
fiscal 1987 and 1990. 
  It said if that increase rate was curbed to the average 
nominal growth rate of 7 percent for gross national product in 
the period, the year-to-year rise in land prices in Tokyo and 
five other big Japanese cities in fiscal 1990 would have been 
limited to 0.6 percent, instead of the actual 11 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) ran aground in its bid to take over a key 
parliamentary committee Tuesday [17 May] when the second largest 
opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] kept 
its distance, opposition sources said. 
  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said, "the party should 
distance itself from both the ruling coalition and the LDP." 
  Murayama told a party meeting, "we cannot allow this issue 
to 
undermine the unity of our party." 
  Murayama referred to an objection from the largest SDPJ 
intraparty group, the democrats, to an LDP-sponsored motion to 
dismiss the chairman of the House of Representatives steering 
committee who is a senior member of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. 
  Following the SDPJ's decision, the lower house will shelve 
the motion aimed at relieving Keiwa Okuda from duties as 
chairman of the steering committee, a key body which sets 
schedules for Diet business. 
  The LDP, which is poised to table a no-confidence motion 
against the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata after the 
passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, submitted the motion against 
Okuda last week. 
  As the largest single party in parliament and also as the 
No. 
1 opposition party, the LDP submitted the anti-Okuda motion in a 
bid to reestablish its leading role in setting the course of 
parliamentary business. 
  The democrats, an SDPJ intraparty bloc of 23 members in the 
lower house, decided Sunday not to support the anti-Okuda motion. 
  Meanwhile, the SDPJ's Diet Affairs Committee Chairman, Koken 
Nosaka, asked the LDP on Tuesday to allow the Diet to defer a 
ballot on the motion despite the earlier SDPJ-LDP accord to take 
concerted action on the motion, SDPJ officials said. 
  Nosaka also contacted Shinseito, asking for its consent to 
replace Okuda shortly after the parliamentary passage of the 
long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget, which is expected to be passed 
in late June, they said. 
  Shinseito rejected the request, saying it will not comply 
with the plea at least until the current regular Diet session 
adjourns. The session is to expire June 29, but its term could 
be extended.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A House of Councillors panel 
decided Tuesday [17 May] on a reform plan that would reduce the 
number of seats in the upper house from the current 252 to 250, 
parliamentary sources said. 
  The committee, comprised of representatives from all upper 
house parliamentary groups, will complete the plan by May 24 and 
draft a bill by the end of the month, they said. 
  Under the scheme, 150 upper house members would be elected 
from prefectural constituencies and 100 through a proportional 
representation system, sources said. Currently, 152 are chosen 
from constituencies. 
  The panel has discussed reform in line with electoral system 
changes made law in January, in which House of Representatives 
seats would be reduced from the current 511 to 500. 
  The number of upper house seats was designed to be a half of 
those in the lower house, the sources said. 
  The House of Councillors reform program also aims to level 
the value of votes that differs from constituency to 
constituency through readjusting the numbers of seats in eight 
electoral districts, they said. 
  After readjustment, the maximum vote value disparity stands 
at 4.81 to 1, compared with 6.48 to 1 as of 1990, they said. 
  Two seats would be added each in Gifu, Kanagawa, Miyagi and 
Saitama prefectures, four seats would be reduced in Hokkaido and 
two would be reduced each in Fukuoka, Hyogo and Kagoshima 
prefectures, they said. 
  The new system also allows voters to vote for individual 
candidates, and not only for political parties as in 
proportional representation polling, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A draft report compiled by a 
working group of the ruling coalition calls for the abolition of 
regional bureaus of the construction, transport and other 
government ministries, coalition officials said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  The unit of the coalition's Tax Reform Consultation Group 
also urged an early enactment of a basic law to promote the 
decentralization of power. 
  The decentralization of power and local administrative 
reforms should be pursued before tax reforms are implemented, 
according to the report. 
  The proposal is intended to promote local administrative 
reforms and the consolidation of local communities, the 
officials said. 
  The proposal is expected to be incorporated into a package 
of 
recommendations a subcommittee on administrative and fiscal 
reforms under the consultation group will make within the month, 
they said. 
  Government ministries, however, are expected to resist the 
proposed abolition of regional bureaus, government sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A top business leader on 
Tuesday [17 May] urged Construction Minister Koji Morimoto to 
delay the planned rise in toll fares on the nation's highways. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers' 
Associations (Nikkeiren), criticized the government over the 
planned toll hike in a press conference last week. 
  The rise in highway tolls would have a strong impact on 
overall prices, he said. 
  Nagano said he will try to testify at a public hearing to be 
held later this month over the proposed increase in highway 
charges. 
  The hearing, cosponsored by the Construction Ministry and 
the 
Transport Ministry, will be held next Tuesday over the plan by 
Japan Highway Public Corp. for an average 10.4 percent rise in 
the tolls. 
  In the meeting with Morimoto, Nagano said he doesn't oppose 
the construction of highways, the funding of which the highway 
corporation cites as a reason for hiking the tolls. 
  It is not fair that only public charges are raised while 
other prices are falling, Nagano told the construction minister. 
  Morimoto said, "I take the (Nikkeiren) president's remarks 
seriously."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A government advisory tax 
panel is inclined to present concrete tax rates and other 
figures in its report scheduled to be issued in June, a senior 
panel member said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Most panelists stressed the need to put "great effort" into 
winning public support through regional hearings by presenting 
"various quantitative options," Sakue Matsumoto, acting chairman 
of the Tax Commission, told reporters after a panel meeting. 
  The advisory panel to the prime minister listed major 
opinions spelled out in seven previous meetings to map out the 
direction for discussion on tax reform, including income tax 
cuts and offsetting tax hikes. 
  Matsumoto, speaking in place of panel chairman Kan Kato, 
said 
he does not know if panelists want to include concrete figures 
in the June report. But he said members agreed to carry out 
"quantitative" discussions. 
  He also said most panelists called for additional proposals 
such as administrative and fiscal streamlining and welfare 
revision to win support if the tax reform is to cover heavier 
burdens on taxpayers. 
  Matsumoto said panelists are still split on whether to 
conduct a full tax reform or take more limited measures under 
the weak economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japan's economy needs 
"little more time" to hit bottom but a "recovery trend is hoped 
for in and after summer," a leading banker said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Some bright signs are seen in personal consumption, and 
housing spending and public works remain buoyant, Toshio 
Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of 
Japan, told a regular news meeting. 
  But he said capital investment is still "motionless" and 
conditions for income and labor are deteriorating. 
  Under these circumstances, Morikawa expressed hopes that the 
15.25 trillion yen stimulus package in February and summer 
income tax cuts would combine to "cement a recovery trend." 
  On possible downward pressures ahead, he reiterated his 
concerns over the yen's rise, delayed passage of fiscal 1994 
budget and stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks. 
  "I hope currency rates will remain stable," Morikawa said, 
noting the yen's rise has come to a halt with recent 
intervention by leading industrial nations to prop up the dollar. 
  However, the yen's current levels are "tough for 
manufacturers," he said. The dollar traded above 104.50 yen in 
Tokyo on Tuesday. 
  On shaky political situations, Morikawa said he does not see 
any great impact on the economy from the minority rule by Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  But he called for "positive handling" to pass the fiscal 
1994 
budget as soon as possible, and to conduct economic reform as 
promised in the March market-opening package, primarily to 
resume trade talks with the United States. 
  "I'm concerned about a further long delay" in passing the 
budget for the year started April 1, even though public works 
are maintained with the third fiscal 1993 budget, he said. 
  Referring to the release of fiscal 1993 business results 
next 
week, Morikawa, who is also president of Sumitomo Bank, said his 
bank is likely to post a better-than-expected net operating 
profit from core banking business since interest rates stayed 
low through the year. 
  But a lower-than-expected pretax profit is predicted from 
active write-offs of nonperforming loans, he said. 
  On the interest rates trend, Morikawa said short-term rates 
are likely to remain stable at low levels for the time being, 
and long-term rates will level off from a recent slight uptrend. 
  U.S. long-term rates are on the rise, but this is unlikely 
to 
affect rates in Japan, where the economy remains weak and prices 
stable, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japanese commercial banks 
hired more employees in the three-year period ended March 31, 
1993, despite the collapse of the speculative "bubble economy," 
according to a private survey published Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Teikoku Databank, which published the survey, said the 
number 
of workers employed by banks as of that date totaled 427,197, up 
3.7 percent from three years earlier during the bubble economy's 
peak, which was characterized by surges in stock and land prices. 
  The employment rise came amid widespread moves among 
industries to cut jobs as part of restructuring programs. 
  Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency, attributed the 
phenomenon to high net operating profits from core banking 
business following a series of cuts in the official discount 
rate by the bank of Japan during recent years. 
  The survey covered 112 leading commercial banks, long-term 
credit banks, trust banks and regional banks, all listed on 
stock exchanges. 
  The poll also showed the number of employees at securities 
companies decreased 2.2 percent in the period under review.

  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said Tuesday [17 May] it has 
formulated a set of bills to ease government regulatory controls. 
  The nine bills, likely to be approved by the cabinet Friday, 
are in line with the government's emergency economic stimulus 
packages announced in September last year and February this 
year, MITI said. 
  Among other things, the bills are aimed at the scrapping of 
obligatory reporting by companies of the formation of export 
associations, the removal of mandatory antidecay treatment for 
lumber to allow for more efficient lumber use, and freer 
creation of chambers of commerce and industry. 
  The bills will be submitted to the current Diet sitting 
along 
with 31 other deregulation bills drawn up by other ministries, 
MITI said. 
  In a related move, MITI said Tuesday it will set up next 
Monday offices to receive public complaints, requests and 
opinions on MITI's deregulation steps. 
  The offices, to be created in MITI's Tokyo headquarters and 
its local units in Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya and six other major 
cities, will be open from Monday through Friday each week, MITI 
said.

said Tuesday [17 may] it was "not very appropriate" for top 
coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa to call the mass-circulation 
daily ASAHI SHIMBUN "a red newspaper" which practices "black 
journalism." 
  The premier was answering questions about the controversial 
remarks by Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core 
party Shinseito led by Hata. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai declined to answer a 
similar question, saying the government cannot comment on 
politicians' individual remarks. 
  Ozawa, speaking on Monday in Chiba, east of Tokyo, blasted 
the daily for "slandering" him, apparently referring to a 26 
April ASAHI SHIMBUN story in which he was quoted as saying that 
"one is free to sleep with the woman of one's choice. It's none 
of your business." 
  The comment was later criticized in the Diet and by some 
public circles as being indiscreet and demeaning of women. 
  According to the ASAHI SHIMBUN, Ozawa made the remark when 
asked about the ruling parties' formation of the parliamentary 
group "Kaishin (Innovation)" the previous day. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) seceded from the coalition 
in late April after Kaishin was formed without the SDP being 
consulted, reducing the Hata coalition to a minority government.

  [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- Declassified Foreign 
Ministry documents soon to be compiled in book form reveal the 
contents of correspondence between U.S.-led occupation forces 
and the Japanese Government in the period just after the end of 
World War II, publishers said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  The publishers said the documents released from the Foreign 
Ministry archives, which are already available in microfilm, 
include messages between the office of the Supreme Commander for 
the Allied Powers (SCAP) and the Central Liaison Office (CLO). 
  The documents will fill some 24 volumes, to be released 
starting in October. 
  They concern such matters as a schedule for the repatriation 
of Koreans from Japan between 1945 and 1946. 
  One CLO document dated October 1945 puts the number of 
Koreans intending to return to Korea at war's end at 1,043,700 
out of a total of 1,668,000, including 670,000 Korean residents, 
336,000 laborers brought to Japan in groups, and 37,700 
demobilized soldiers. 
  Another CLO document from October 1945 lists the locations 
and employers of 31,229 Chinese workers in 25 prefectures across 
the Japanese archipelago who were brought to Japan to alleviate 
the wartime labor shortage. 
  The document goes on to detail Chinese worker "agitations" 
since the war's end which "have become so violent as to 
constitute a great menace to peace and order." 
  "Not only do they disregard the terms of contract which they 
accepted before as reasonable and satisfactory, but also demand 
`special' treatments as nationals of a victorious power," it 
said. 
  Among the offending acts cited were mob violence, plundering 
of weapons, plundering of money and other articles and "insults" 
toward women. 
  "In order to enforce their excessive demands, they resort 
even to armed demonstrations causing bloodshed," the document 
said. "Disturbances are increasing day after day, creating 
unrest and confusion among the people." 
  The CLO recommended immediate repatriation of the Chinese, 
saying Japanese authorities faced difficulties keeping them 
under control in view of the disarmament of the army and the 
weakening of the police forces.

Fujii said Wednesday [18 May] his ministry's goal of holding 
bond revenues to less than 5 percent of the government's general 
account budget in fiscal 1999 may be difficult to achieve. 
  Fujii, answering questions before the Budget Committee of 
the 
House of Representatives, said the goal is a "target to strive 
for." 
  The ministry published the goal in a medium-term fiscal 
outlook it submitted to the committee Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Private-sector machinery 
orders in March rose a sharp 10.3 percent from February to 
provide an indicator that the downtrend in capital spending is 
coming to an end, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said 
Tuesday [17 May]. 
  March machinery orders, excluding volatile orders for ships 
and from electric power firms, came to 946.8 billion yen, after 
falling a month-on-month 6.3 percent in February. 
  On a year-on-year basis, the figure marks a 0.2 percent dip, 
compared with an 8.9 percent yearly drop reported the previous 
month. 
  Private machinery orders are regarded as the key indicator 
of 
corporate investment in plant and equipment for the months ahead. 
  An EPA official said the March figure underscores that the 
downward cycle in machinery orders is coming to completion. 
  Thanks to the boost in March orders, orders for the 
January-March quarter marked a 6.6 percent increase from the 
previous three-month period, which is far above the government's 
target of a 9.6 percent decline. 
  The official, however, quickly added the agency wants to 
keep 
a close watch on the data for the time being rather than making 
its own prediction on machinery orders in the coming months. 
  His caution apparently reflects poor forecasts for the 
April-June period simultaneously released, which projected a 
13.0 percent plunge in private machinery orders excluding 
volatile ones. 
  He said the forecast, based on the agency's hearings 
conducted in late March on 280 firms, seems partly dampened by a 
negative reaction to the buoyant results in the January-March 
quarter. 
  In the latest reporting month, private orders including 
those 
for ships and from power firms, at 1,158.6 billion yen, were 
flat from February and down 5.1 percent from the year before. 
  Orders from the public sector totaled 334.3 billion yen, a 
25.3 percent surge from the prior month and up 6.4 percent from 
a year earlier. 
  Foreigners placed orders totaling 542.4 billion yen, also up 
a steep 24.2 percent from February and an 8.8 percent rise from 
the same month last year. 
  All included, overall machinery orders in March amounted to 
2,231.6 billion yen, 9.1 percent larger than February and 0.2 
percent more than a year earlier, the agency said. 
  The EPA also said private machinery orders, free of volatile 
factors, for fiscal 1993 which ended March 31 totaled 10,568.4 
billion yen, down 9.4 percent from the previous year. 
  Overall orders also dropped 3.3 percent to 24,679.8 billion 
yen for the third straight year of decline, but the EPA official 
noted the fall was less sharp than a 9.8 percent drop the 
previous year.

  [Text] Sendai, May 18 KYODO -- The Miyagi Prefectural 
Government has decided to disclose information concerning the 
delivery of nuclear material shipments to and from a power plant 
in the prefecture, prefectural government sources said Wednesday 
[18 May]. 
  The central government in Tokyo, however, is opposing the 
prefecture's plan. 
  "This decision...is regrettable," said Kenichi Maruyama, an 
official of the Nuclear Safety Bureau of the Science and 
Technology Agency. 
  He said management of information relating to transport of 
nuclear fuel falls within an international framework and the 
Miyagi Government's unilateral decision "deviates from this." 
  The central government in April 1993 advised power plant 
localities to avoid divulging such information as a precaution 
against sensitive materials falling into the wrong hands. 
  The Miyagi Government has decided to reveal information 
regarding the shipping of spent nuclear fuel from the Onagawa 
plant run by Tohoku Electric Power Co., the first such public 
disclosure in Japan. 
  While the information will not include the time of 
transport, 
name of ship or route taken, it will detail such things as fuel 
quantity, container type, country of destination and whereabouts 
of a reprocessing plant. 
  The decision was made in response to the urging of a local 
antinuclear group. 
  Maruyama said the agency intends to summon Miyagi Government 
officials to discuss the situation. 
  He said the prefecture will be advised to tighten its 
control 
of information, taking into consideration the negative overseas 
reaction that public disclosure of such information would likely 
generate, as well as how it would adversely affect other 
prefectures.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- An Environment Agency panel 
has drafted a new long-term program calling for greater 
involvement by individuals, businesses and the government in 
efforts to protect natural surroundings from industrial 
pollution. 
  KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the draft program 
sketched out by the agency's central environmental council, 
headed by University of Tokyo Professor Emeritus Jiro Kondo. 
  The draft says, "the expansion of human social and economic 
activities...led to the excessive use of natural resources so as 
to nullify the environment's ability to restore original levels 
of the resources, while depleting wildlife and reducing its 
ability to survive." 
  "It also triggered pollution of the environment by expanding 
the discharge of unnecessary waste," it said. 
  "It is also important to defend and preserve the environment 
by conquering the sort of environmental destruction attributable 
to modern lifestyles in cities," it said. 
  The draft urged the public in developed countries to 
"question the current mode of civilization where prevailing 
values have encouraged mass production, huge consumption and the 
subsequent vast discharge of waste into the environment." 
  The report also urged individual members of Japanese society 
to "take action" useful in staving off environmental 
deterioration. 
  However, it stopped short of setting numerical targets and 
specific timetables that could be referred to as yardsticks for 
attaining the cleanup of contaminated areas. 
  The report also urged the government and local communities 
to 
step up efforts to preserve and protect small forests in cities 
that have survived the rapid urbanization of Japan. 
  It cautioned that such forests, beaches and paddy fields in 
mountainous areas are on the brink of losing their natural 
capabilities to provide shelter to small animals and to clean up 
contaminated water. 
  The draft also urged efforts to prevent wildlife not native 
to Japan, like the black bass, from damaging Japan's ecosystem. 
Such wildlife have infiltrated the Japanese environment 
following their intentional or unwitting importation, the report 
said.

  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, 17 May KYODO -- A 48-member 
Japanese delegation returned to Nemuro on Tuesday [17 May] night 
after a four-day trip to Etorofu Island, one of four disputed 
Russian islands claimed by Japan, under a visa-free exchange 
program, tour organizers said. 
  The group landed at Nayoka on Etorofu on Sunday morning and 
stayed at the houses of local residents. 
  Bad weather forced the cancellation of events scheduled for 
Monday before departing for Nemuro. 
  The mission included 24 former residents of the island and 
nine members involved in a campaign for the return to Japan of 
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets. 
  A similar Japanese group visited Kunashiri earlier this 
month 
under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. It was the 
first group of the year to travel to the disputed islands. 
  A Russian group visited Hokkaido in April. 
  The four islands were seized by Soviet troops at the end of 
World War II.

  [Text] Nara, May 18 KYODO -- Representatives from Chinese 
and Japanese municipalities sharing sister-city ties are taking 
part in a two-day symposium that opened Wednesday [18 May] to 
mark more than 20 years of friendly cultural exchanges. 
  Some 160 participants, including 20 Chinese delegates from 
cities such as Xian and Shanghai, will discuss ideas on further 
promoting exchanges and mutual understanding. 
  The delegates are expected to offer ideas on youth exchanges 
as well as city planning and management, organizers said. 
  The conference, hosted by the Japan-China Friendship 
Association, is the first of its kind to be held on such a large 
scale, organizers said. 
  The western Japanese port city of Kobe and Tianjin, 
southeast 
of Beijing, were the first to conclude sister-city ties in June 
1973 and since then some 150 similar sets of ties have been 
established. 
  Nara was selected as the site of the symposium because of 
the 
ancient capital's history of dispatching envoys to China from 
the seventh to ninth centuries.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chong-min, former president of Taeyang </F>
Trading Company, a firm run by the Workers Party of Korea] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  1. "Wishing you happiness" Disappeared </H5>
  The weather in early January in North Korea is usually very 
cold, and in this frigid weather the communists stage a 
propaganda barrage, including political-ideological campaigns, 
to idolize Kim Il-song and his son, Kim Chong-il. That is why 
the new year atmosphere in North Korea is entirely different 
from what it used to be before liberation. And it is one of the 
main features of this season that the Workers Party [WPK] 
bustles about trying to make people feel that the atmosphere is 
less oppressive. 
  In North Korea there is a lot of propaganda going on every 
month. But February is special because Kim Chong-il's birthday 
falls then. The lunar new year, the founding anniversary of the 
Academy of Sciences, and Machine Industry Day also fall in 
February. Formerly, the founding anniversary of Korean People's 
Army (KPA) was also observed then, and February marks the 
proclamation of the Communist Manifesto. But as arrangements for 
the transfer of power between the Kims took hold, Kim Chong-il's 
birthday came to assume special significance, and people have 
to bustle about at home and in their organizations making 
preparations to celebrate the "February Holiday," Kim 
Chong-il's birthday. [passage omitted] 
  In North Korea the word "happiness" is interpreted by and 
large in a Confucian or superstitious sense. The communists 
have long claimed that there is no such thing as Heaven or 
Buddha, nor God. The Workers Party emphasizes that "No one 
should depend on Heaven and God, unscientific beings, but 
realize that he can be happy only under the solicitude and care 
of Kim Il-song and his son." That is why to say "Wish you 
happiness" would be tantamount to an insult to Kim Il-song and 
his son. [passage omitted] 
  The typical greetings exchanged among North Korean people on 
New Year's Day are "Congratulations on the New Year." Some go 
one step farther and say, "Be healthy in the New Year." The 
highest form of greeting is to say, "Let us work harder to be 
loyal to the leader and the party." 
  The words people use in addressing one another in North 
Korea differ slightly depending on one's social status. The 
word "tongji" [comrade in English] is used in addressing a 
superior, and the word "tongmu" [friend, or comrade in English] 
in addressing a subordinate. The word "sonsaeng" [teacher] is 
used among teachers when they address each other, or by a 
junior when he addresses his many years senior. In most cases 
"tongmu" or "tongji" is used. 
  By the superior-subordinate relationship here is meant not 
only the relationship in offices between superiors and 
inferiors but also the differences in social status and sex. It 
is customary for women to use the word "tongji," which is 
considered more honorific than the word "tongmu," in addressing 
a male colleague who is equal in rank and about the same age, 
for the simple reason that he is a male. 
  To give typical examples of how North Koreans address one 
another, they put either the surname or given name and his 
title before the word "tongmu,' for instance, "so and so 
guidance worker tongmu." In addressing a soldier, one puts his 
military rank before the word tongmu. In addressing an 
unmarried woman whose name is not known, the words "chonyo 
tongmu" are used. 
  During their stay in Pyongyang, members of the South Korean 
delegation to the last North-South high-level talks were said 
to have used the word "agassi" when they talked to waitresses 
or female guides in their hotels or at the parties, and this 
evoked an ire of the waitresses and female guides. But as far 
as these waitresses were concerned, their protest was quite 
natural or so it seems. 
  This is because the meaning of the word "agassi" is 
distorted in North Korea, and it implies a mean word associated 
with bar hostesses or toys for playboys. 

<H5>    2. Origin of "February Holiday" </H5>
  In the month of February all North Koreans are busy 
preparing for Kim Chong-il's birthday. This, together with the 
rigidity of social customs, produces an atmosphere giving the 
impression that no other human beings exist except Kim Il-song 
and his son in the North. Kim Chong-il's birthday began to be 
officially marked inside the party in 1973 shortly after he 
emerged as the future successor. The observation of his birthday 
gradually expanded until it became an official national 
holiday, observed both partywide and nationwide, beginning in 
1976. 
  As is well known, the Workers Party carried out concrete 
campaigns to highlight the image of Kim Chong-il as heir to Kim 
Il-song after he was formally designated as such under 
meticulously worked out many-sided plans. 
  Kim Chong-il was born to Kim Il-song and his wife, Kim 
Chong-suk, in the former Soviet Union's far east where the 
senior Kim and his wife were spending relatively peaceful days 
after having taken refuge there from mopping-up operations by 
the Japanese Kanto Army. While partially acknowledging the 
circumstances surrounding Kim Chong- il's birth, the North 
Korean Communists worked out an elaborate plan to conceal 
information on the place of his birth. 
  Under this plan it must have been not so difficult to change 
his birthplace from the Soviet Union to Mt. Paektu and present 
him as a genius from his childhood. 
  Unexpected difficulties were encountered in the attempt to 
squash all kinds of sordid rumors and scandals about Kim 
Chong-il that circulated in the days when he was enroled at 
Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Namsan Higher Middle 
School. The main reason is that he indulged in so many unsavory 
acts. But in those days these scandals were regarded as 
something to be proud of in view of his great importance as the 
son of Kim Il-song instead of being looked upon as misconduct. 
Naturally it became an awfully difficult to conceal them. 
  It must have been under Kim Il-song's orders that the North 
Korean Workers Party did its best in those days to preserve Kim 
Chong-il's "authority and prestige." This is apparent from the 
fact that the party presented "the 10-point program for 
establishing the unitary ideology system of the party" in 1974, 
strongly demanding the idolization not only of Kim Il-song but 
also of Kim Chong-il in accordance with the principle of "the 
unitary leadership system." 
  The Kim Il-song clan concentrated its influence in such a 
way as to enhance Kim Chong-il's position, and this caused 
various secondary problems. It is well-known among party 
insiders that in those days Kim Chong-il's most intimate 
college classmates who were involved in his misconduct were 
ruthlessly punished. 
  During the early part of Kim Chong-il's leadingship in art, 
filmdom in particular, with his post at the party's Department 
of Propaganda and Agitation, he indulged in debauchery with 
beautiful women in movie and theater circles for quite a long 
time. 
  Shortly after Kim Chong-il was appointed as party secretary 
in charge of the WPK Department of Organization in his capacity 
as the future successor to power, his birthday was observed as a 
party holiday beginning in 1974, when he was 32. On his 34th 
birthday on 16 February 1976, his birthday was designated as a 
national holiday, and ever since it has been observed as such. 

<H5>    3. Kim Chong-il's Birthday and Lunar New Year </H5>
  North Korea reinstated traditional festivals such as lunar 
New Year's Day in preparation for the eventuality that it would 
be compelled by its domestic situation to agree to inter-Korean 
personnel exchanges not only at an official level but also at a 
private level. North Korea feared that through North-South 
talks South Koreans might come to notice that many traditional 
national festivals had long since disappeared, and North Koreans 
might come to notice how the South Koreans still observed 
traditional national festivals. 
  True, North Korea revived some of the old festivals 
including the lunar New Year and the Tano Festival (the fifth 
day of the fifth lunar month). But the peculiar characteristics 
of the communist regime permitted the revival of these 
festivals only in form. Inasmuch as the lunar New Year happens 
to fall in about the same season with Kim Chong- il's birthday, 
it was an impossible thing to revive this festival in its 
original form. North Korea could have attached some 
significance to it, but did not do so because of Kim Chong-il's 
birthday. 
  In those days in North Korea, as is the case now, it was 
inconceivable to think Kim Chong-il could be involved in any 
misconduct. Kim Il-song never permitted the disclosure of Kim 
Chong-il's debauchery, which remains the junior Kim's major 
misbehavior. 
  A countless number of those infamous pimps who vied with 
each other in those days to curry favor with Kim Chong-il were 
subsequently sacrificed to prove that not Kim Chong-il, but the 
sycophants were responsible for all his flaws that appeared 
before or after he was designated as Kim Il-song's future 
successor. They include: Chon Mun- sop, then commander of the 
Guard Force; Chang Yun-pil, then adjutant general for security 
at Guard Department I, the General Bureau of Security; Pak 
Sung-un, then deputy director of propaganda at the political 
affairs bureau, the Ministry of Public Security; and Cha Kye- 
ryong, then head of the Movie Actors Group. 
  Kim Chong-il continued to indulge in debauchery even after 
he was designated the successor, producing many more toadies. 
Kim Il- song's second wife, Kim Song-ae, dropped hints to him 
about Kim Chong- il's misconduct. But Kim Il-song squashed them 
recalling her interference when they were young and suspecting 
that Kim Song-ae might be dropping such hints in retaliation 
for her fall in her prestige in as a result of Kim Chong-il's 
designation as successor. 
  However, at about the time Kim Chong-il's sex scandals were 
on the verge of becoming public, his relatives, including Hwang 
Chang-yop and his wife and Yang Hyong-sop, were officially 
informed of the misconduct, making them concerned about its 
possible consequences. With this happening, Kim Il-song became 
enraged and exercised his authority to bring the trouble under 
control. 
  First, Kim Il-song examined Kim Chong-il's performance as 
successor in the making, and after determining the causes of 
the trouble, dealt with those responsible. Later, during a 
top-level session of the December 1977 WPK Plenum, he placed 
"special organizational issues" on the agenda. With Kim Il-song 
in the chair, the meeting did not scrutinize Kim Chong-il's 
conduct, but nevertheless evaluated his performance very 
closely. From beginning to end, the meeting examined "problems 
that have cropped up within the party." 
  Following the Plenum, the party removed Kim Chong-il's 
portraits from some places and suspended the campaign to 
idolize him. In addition, such strict restrictions were placed 
on matters requiring Kim Chong- il's full participation that he 
was allowed to handle them only with the approval of Kim 
Il-song. 
  In those days ordinary homes were not allowed to hang Kim 
Chong-il's portraits; only the Party Central Committee and 
other party organizations at the central level were allowed to 
do so. That is why ordinary people had practically no way of 
knowing about this ruffled father- son relationship. However, it 
is true that people got the impression that the frenzied 
campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il had nearly come to a halt and 
that Kim Chong-il himself was so circumspect as to take a back 
seat. 
  With things coming to this, the question of making Kim 
Chong-il the successor became a subject of open discussion 
once again beginning in the late 1970's because Kim Il-song had 
no way of choosing anyone other than Kim Chong-il as his 
successor. In 1973, a year after Kim Il-song's 60th birthday in 
1972, Kim Chong-il was appointed as Party secretary in charge 
of organization. However, there was a time when various 
adulatory titles for Kim Chong-il disappeared for a 
while--titles such as "the Party Center," "the sagacious 
leader," "the great Kimilsongist," and "the lodestar." 
  In those days a harsh punishment was meted out to Yi 
Yong-mu, Kim Chong-il's notorious pimp who was promoted to the 
directorship of the General Political Bureau, the Ministry of 
People's Armed Forces, from its deputy directorship. Many of 
his associates also became a subject of discussion as possible 
targets of punishment. 
  Some of these pimps were hit hard by Kim Chong-il himself 
for the mistakes they committed as pimps, and others were 
punished by his father because they were too sycophantic to Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Then Minister of Culture Pak Chong-sin, the former South 
Korean stage actress who defected to the North, ended up losing 
her position because she, a middle-aged woman, offered no help 
to Kim Chong-il in his debauchery and was in fact regarded as a 
source of trouble by meddling in every move of famous actresses. 
  On the surface, the sole excuse used in dismissing people in 
North Korea is the failure to implement party policy and the 
distortion of Kim Il- song's instructions. In all cases, the 
real reason was that officials had called for righteousness 
against the wrongdoings of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il or they 
failed to please their whims. 
  This same Kim Chong-il came into the spotlight once again 
during the process of making preparations for the Sixth WPK 
Congress in 1979, and he has remained in the spotlight ever 
since. Leaving his work and daily life aside for future 
discussion, here I will briefly describe how North Korea 
celebrates Kim Chong-il's birthday. 

<H5>    4. Additional North Korean National Holiday </H5>
  As was the case with Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il has tried 
hard to attach great significance to his birthday. [passage 
omitted] 
  There was one change that took place for the first time 
after Kim Chong-il was elevated to his post as director of the 
WPK Department of Organization and Guidance. Ordinary people 
came to know of it two to three years later. There are many 
who still do not know about it. The change was the replacement 
of license numbers of cadres' private cars with the numerals 
indicating the date of Kim Chong-il's birthday. 
  Beginning in the mid-70's Kim Chong-il personally presented 
sedans to cadres as gifts. All these cars carried license 
numbers beginning with 2-16. This practice continues. North 
Koreans call these sedans "gift cars" or "Central Party cars." 
[passage omitted] 
  Cars carrying license numbers beginning with 2-16 can pass 
check points in the suburbs of Pyongyang and travel anywhere in 
the country without a travel pass, curfew pass, or Sunday pass. 
  North Korea raised the lower limit on the ranks of officials 
eligible for the private use of automobiles by one or two 
grades beginning in the early 1970's due to the gasoline 
shortage. Lower ranking officials had to use official cars 
dispatched upon request. Even the operation of dispatched cars 
was strictly controlled, with their use banned on Sundays and at 
nighttime. 
  Kim Chong-il presents signed "citations" and "watches 
bearing his name" to close aides. Anyone who receives a citation 
or a gift watch from Kim Il-song or Kim Chong-il who retires 
under the age limit, is entitled to receive his pre-retirement 
salary. For this reason, these citations and watches are highly 
coveted. 
  These are luxury watches made to order, and have a large 
variety, including gold Rolexes and Omegas. They are allocated 
according to the ranks of the awardees. Of course, retirement 
pay varies according to rank. 
  Anyone who had an opportunity to meet Kim Il-song or Kim 
Chong-il on official business, or who was granted an audience in 
recognition of meritorious service, will be recorded as one 
granted an audience. He will not only be given social 
prominence but also be assured of a monetary reward in his old 
age. Of course, its size varies depending on the substance and 
nature of the audience. 
  In North Korea no cadres, party members, or non-party 
officials are allowed to exchange gifts. This is because the ban 
on exchange of gifts is stipulated in the 10 Party principles 
on the grounds that gift exchanges are bound to result in an 
unprincipled collaboration. 
  When a cadre is discovered exchanging gifts, he becomes a 
"target of disciplinary action" and is subject to charges of 
violating the unitary ideology system. He is subjected to 
disciplinary action by the party or loses his job. However, it 
is a stark reality that despite these strict controls, the 
practice of exchanging gifts is rampant due to chronic 
scarcities and shortages. 
  But things are different with Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
As was the case with Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il is fond of 
exchanging gifts. While watching him playing his gift-exchange 
game, one may question whether he is administering the affairs 
of state or playing house. This is because he indulges so much 
in the game of exchanging gifts and other tokens with his aides 
and toadies. [passage omitted] 
  On his birthday Kim Chong-il gives gifts to his close aides, 
top cadres, and even second-echelon officials in the 
Secretariat according to rank. He pays more attention to 
choosing gifts on his birthday than he does on the occasion of 
the "DPRK Foundation Day" or "Party Foundation Day." 
  In some cases he gives far more and far better gifts on his 
birthday than on his father's. Most probably, he might be doing 
so under special instructions from Kim Il-song. 
  With the establishment of Kim Il-song's and Kim Chong-il's 
practice of exchanging gifts with others, a gift section was 
formally set up in the WPK Central Committee to prepare all 
gifts to be presented. In addition, the Office of the President 
and the second bureau of the General Bureau of Security each 
have their own special sections to handle gifts from Kim 
Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  In special cases, Kim Chong-il presents automobiles to some 
cadres on his birthday on 16 February. Ordinarily, daily 
necessities and food items are the bulk of the gifts. Generally, 
the list includes: fabric for suits, shirts and ties, 
underwear, briefcases, suitcases, and various home electronic 
appliances, books of poetry, quotations from Kim Il-song or Kim 
Chong-il, fountain pens, ballpoints, calendars, etc., etc. 
Included in food items are: venison, pheasant, various kinds of 
meat, canned meat, tangerines, candies, and alcoholic beverages 
(one or two bottles). 
  Gifts are presented collectively to each unit of each party 
organization sometimes, and individually at others. With food 
gift items, it is customary to share them with people in the 
same office or subordinates. But occasionally, this is not the 
case with some recipients. 
  Before Kim Chong-il's birthday was designated as an official 
holiday, Kim Il-song on the occasion of his 60th birthday had a 
serious and lengthy discussion with his aides to examine 
various problems that might arise in the future when Chong-il's 
birthday was to be observed as a national holiday so that they 
might work out measures to deal with them in advance. The 
reason was that they believed that the observance of Kim 
Chong-il's birthday would be of great importance in idolizing 
him. 
  Kim Chong-il was born on 16 February 1942. In those days the 
date 8 February was observed as People's Armed Forces Day in 
commemoration of the founding of the KPA on that date in 1948. 
Therefore, realistically it would be a problem if they were to 
observe two national days in the same month, about a week 
apart. The reason was that they had to highlight Kim Chong-il's 
birthday, and yet it would be illogical to downgrade Armed 
Forces Day. 
  After much thought, the WPK had at a fantastic idea. The 8 
February holiday would be merged with the founding anniversary 
of the People's Revolutionary Army Day on 25 April, integrating 
the two into People's Armed Forces Day. The Party claimed that 
this was in line with the KPA being the successor to the 
People's Revolutionary Army. The underlying thought was that the 
date of birth is something that cannot be changed and that by 
combining the two armed forces days, the party would be able 
not only to highlight the KPA as the inheritor of the 
revolutionary tradition but also to enable the KPA to take 
pride in its history, which is as long as that of the army of 
any other country. 

<H5>    5. Birthday Functions </H5>
  Functions on Kim Chong-il's birthday do not differ much from 
those on Kim Il-song's except for the peculiar focus of the 
former. Emphasis is placed on highlighting Kim Chong-il's image 
as an "artistic genius" and "the sun of the future." 
  Customarily, he loathes appearing at formal conferences or 
official gatherings. On the contrary, he rather likes informal 
get-togethers, such as social gatherings, private parties, 
concerts, and drinking parties. [passage omitted] 
  The subjects of conversation at social gatherings held at 
Kim Chong-il's initiative are mostly political issues and 
matters related to the idolization of him, or sex problems 
discussed in the background of music and dance. 
  It is no exaggeration to say that the basic established 
theories behind current party policies in North Korea have 
their origin in conversations at these sundry informal 
gatherings such as private parties organized by Kim Chong-il's 
aides in his honor, where all problems converge so that he and 
his aides might discuss them. 
  Parties are organized prior to Kim Chong-il's birthday 
presumably to decide the scope and form of the celebration. 
Subjects of discussion will include: the direction of political 
work; the substance of propaganda and agitation; the direction 
of art and cultural work; matters relating to report meetings, 
commemorative lecture meetings, and seminars; the direction of 
overseas propaganda; the direction for birthday celebrations 
giving full play to the characteristics of each sector; the 
substance, methods, and forms of events that will be held by 
agencies at all levels and by the general public in celebration 
of the birthday. 
  Needless to say, not all these matters are discussed each 
time. Except for policy issues concerning the birthday 
observance and some of the matters relating to the scope, form, 
and substance of the observance, it is a rule to follow past 
practice even without specific instructions. 
  In the early 1970's, his birthday began to be observed. 
Subsequently, the scope and substance of its celebration 
gradually expanded and diversified each year except for about a 
one year hiatus in around 1978. Mass artistic presentations 
developed as the main form of celebration. In the beginning the 
observance of Kim Chong-il's birthday was overshadowed by Kim 
Il-song's, but it is significant that the observance 
increasingly became an open affair and finally developed into a 
public observance full of political paraphernalia. 
  Until the late 1980's the general substance and form of 
celebration consisted of art performances in each unit and 
organization in addition to those presented by national art 
organizations. On the whole, performances at each unit took the 
form of a mass presentation by administrative, party, and other 
cadres of the unit. Strikingly, they have sought artistic 
impressions of loyalty through inter-unit competition. 
  Normally each unit presents art performances three or four 
times. But they spend several months making preparations. Some 
go so far as to concentrate on rehearsals leaving work aside. 
Others lacking their own talents appoint outsiders or expert 
artists to certain positions in advance and call them up when 
they need them as members of the cast in their presentations in 
honor of Kim Chong-il's birthday. Powerful organizations such 
as the Central Committee are more prone to this kind of 
expediency. 
  Kim Chong-il or Kim Il-song takes part in the best program 
selected from art performances presented by non-professional 
groups, and the cast of that program will win the trust and 
special consideration of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. That is 
why all units are vying each other to, in their words, "offer 
happiness and satisfaction." That is what is going on in North 
Korea today. 
  All kinds of things occur in preparation for performances. 
Some cadres, total strangers to the arts, are compelled to 
participate because they cannot decline, for it involves the 
question of loyalty. The moment they appear on stage, they 
stand like a totem pole, unable to utter their lines, or they 
act so awkwardly that the audience breaks into laughter. It is 
so comical that Kim Chong-il likes it. That is why more and 
more people are participating in birthday performances, and 
some interesting performances are staged. 
  Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il mobilize various party and 
government organizations to exact birthday gifts from our 20 
million fellow countrymen in the North. As on Kim Il-song's 
birthday, all organizations and certain individuals are forced 
to present letters of congratulations on Kim Chong-il's 
birthday. This was established as a routine political formality. 
[passage omitted] 
  They have even created a special flower called the Kim 
Chong-il flower just as they previously created the Kim Il-song 
flower. 
  On Kim Chong-il's birthday, all units and inhabitants have 
to present their gifts, which are roughly divided into four 
categories: first, foreign currency as a token of loyalty; 
second, gold as a token of loyalty; gifts of loyalty (health 
food, agricultural products, traditional native products, 
fishery products, and various ornaments and valuables); fourth, 
the selection of the Kim Chong-il's ideal maiden. [passage 
omitted]

high-heeled shoes. 
  FAMILY RELATIONS 
  Kim Hyong-chik married Kang Pan-sok. Kim Il-song was born 
to them in 1912. He married Kim Chong-suk (born in 1917), and 
Kim Song-ae (born in 1924). 
  With Kim Chong-suk, he had Kim Chong-il (born in 1942), 
Syu-ra, and Kim Kyong-hui (born in 1946). The latter married 
Chang Song-taek (born in 1946) and that union produced Chang 
Kum-song (born in 1977). Kim Chong-il married Hong Il-so and 
that union produced Kim Hye-Kyong (born in 1968). Kim Chong-il 
married Song Hye-rim (born in 1937) and that union produced Kim 
Chong-nam (born in 1971). Kim Chong-il also married Kim Hye-suk 
and that union produced Kim Un-song (born in 1974). 
  Kim Il-song's marriage to Kim Song-ae resulted in the births 
of Kim Kyong-chin (1952), Kim Pyong-il (1953) and Kim Yong-il 
(1955). The latter is listed as having an offspring named Kim 
Song-kang (born in 1983 with no mother listed). Kim Kyong-chin 
married Kim Kwang-sop (born in 1952) and the union produced two 
children (Kim Chung-min, born in 1981 and Kim Tong-min, born in 
1983). Kim Pyong-il married Kim Sun-kum (born in 1956) and that 
union produced two children (Kim Un-song born in 1981 and Kim 
In-kang born in 1983).

  Never in Military Uniform 
  Unlike his half brother Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il has no 
military experience. But he is currently the KPA supreme 
commander and holds the title of marshal. He is also the 
chairman of the National Defense Commission. 
  But he was never, not even once, shown up in military 
uniform. Even when he reviewed troops during the 60th 
anniversary of the North Korean army (on 25 April 1992), he was 
in people's uniform, not in military uniform. [passage omitted] 
  Little Experience Abroad 
  He was born in the Soviet Union. During the Korean War, he 
took refuge in Jilin in Jilin Province, China. He never 
stayed longer in any one place abroad than he did in Jilin. 
  (North Korea claims that Kim Chong-il took refuge in Mt 
Changsa in Kanggye where he engaged in logistic support for the 
KPA.) 
  Subsequently, accompanying Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il visited 
Moscow in 1957 and East Germany and Romania in 1959. That is 
about all of his travel experience abroad. There is an 
unconfirmed report that Kim Chong-il attended an East German 
air force academy, but he left the academy and returned home 
shortly afterward probably because he did poorly at school. 
  Kim Chong-il toured various places in China in 1983 and 
1984. There is no further information on his foreign experience. 
  Maybe that is why he likes movies and music. Reportedly, he 
likes Russian, American, and Japanese movies and Korean folk 
songs. He likes to drink cognac while boasting of North Korean 
wine, and smokes British Dunhill cigarettes, probably to 
vicariously sample a foreign experience. 
  As for his known foreign language ability, he can say only 
such rudimentary expressions as "Thank you" and "How are you?" 
in Japanese. Presumably, he may speak some Chinese and German 
also. 
  Perhaps he may be having some other foreign travel 
experiences in secret. 
  Kim Chong-il's Nicknames 
  The more closed a society is, the more secret language it 
produces. An examination of argot associated with Kim Chong-il 
or his nicknames will be of great help in understanding his 
personality. 
  Some of the derisive expressions used to describe his 
appearance are: "oppossum hair" and "chuche hair" for his curly 
hair; "squint eyes" or "cross- eyed," "midget," "greenhorn," and 
"little bear" for his eyes and diminutive stature. Expressions 
deriding his behavior include: "womanizer," "pervert," "brat," 
"hedgehog," and "chestnut burr." "Altitude" is slang deriding 
his habit of wearing elevator shoes to appear taller than he is.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter U Chong-chang: "How Is the Money of </F>
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan Remitted to 
North Korea?"] 
  [Text] We could not feel the warm breeze of April but a 
piercing wind was blowing, making us adjust our clothes. We are 
at Niigata Port, situated on the western coast of Japan, at 
around 1430 on 20 April. Niigata Port is where the fellow 
countrymen who were repatriated to the North, are filled with 
regret. Right at this place, the ship Mangyongbong-92 came to 
anchor. It left Niigata Port on 11 April with the 
congratulatory group of Kim Il-song's 82d birthday and the 
visiting group to visit their families who were repatriated to 
the North. It returned after making a 1,000km trip from Wonsan 
to Niigata. 
  At around 1330, one hour before the arrival of the 
Mangyongbong-92, one omnibus carrying a a white banner with the 
word "reception" in Korean, and one automobile upon which hung a 
large North Korean flag arrived at the pier. The only people 
welcoming the Mangyongbong-92 were five to six people in the 
omnibus and the automobile which came from the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] 
Headquarters in Niigata Prefecture and the Niigata Central 
Branch of Chongnyon. The crowd welcoming the Kim Il-song 
birthday congratulatory group was also shabby. 
  When the Mangyongbong-92 slowly came into the pier, the 
`Song 
of General Kim Il-song' was heard through the large speaker. 
Employees of the Niigata Port Maritime Security Office set up 
barricades at both ends of the pier and controlled people from 
coming and going. When the door of the ship's cabin opened, 
three Japanese customs officers went on board and then the 
passengers got off board headed by an old man in a wheelchair. 
The number of passengers amounted to 250 people. 
  When leaving Niigata Port on 11 April, there were about 
1,000 
pieces of baggage, but now there was only one bag per person. 
They left with much baggage and returned empty handed. Some 
big figures including reporters from the CHOSON SINBO, a paper 
affiliated with Chongnyon, carried North Korean special products 
such as blueberry wine and ginseng liquor. These were not 
contained in shopping bags but in vinyl bags for one-day use. 
The customs procedure ended by attaching just one tag to their 
belongings. 
  In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, measures 
for economic sanctions in North Korea have been brought up. 
Thus, Niigata Port is once again attracting the world's 
attention. Among the economic sanctions, the greatest blow 
North Korea can suffer from is blocking the remittance of money 
to North Korea through the Mangyongbong-92. The easiest place 
to restrain the Mangyongbong-92 from going to North Korea is 
Niigata Port. 
  Niigata Port is the original base of the repatriation ship. 
Niigata Port can be seen in our textbooks. The first 
repatriation ship left Niigata Port on 14 December 1959, 
carrying 975 Korean residents in Japan from 238 households. 
Since then until 1984, 93,339 Korean residents in Japan boarded 
the repatriation ship for North Korea at Niigata Port. Since 
there were no longer any Korean residents in Japan who wanted to 
go to North Korea, such a project was completely suspended in 
1984. Nevertheless, the Mangyongbong-92's entry into Niigata 
Port continues. 
  Along the 2km road from the Minami Plaza Hotel in Niigata 
Prefecture to the office of the Niigata Chongnyon Headquarters, 
many willows have been planted. They have been planted along 
the street every 50 meters. This is the 'willow street' which 
Chongnyon takes pride in. Chongnyon had planted these trees in 
commemoration of the first repatriation ship that left Niigata 
Port in 1959. The willows which were only the size of a child's 
finger, have now grown to be as thick as an adult's thigh, 35 
years later. The willows are growing to be a symbol of time 
showing the history of the repatriation ship. 
  It has been learned that since last autumn, when it began 
to discuss in earnest the problem of economic sanctions against 
North Korea, the Japanese Government has put under control 
Chongnyon's remittance to North Korea via Niigata port. However, 
we could not sense such an atmosphere on-the-spot at Niigata. 
The international terminal of Niigata port where the 
Mangyongbong is anchored was rather decorated as a tourist site. 
The terminal did not look like a chilly and quiet port as it was 
seen when Korean residents in Japan were repatriated to North 
Korea in the past. An observation platform and seats for 
spectators were installed in the terminal so that people can 
observe the Mangyongbong calling at and leaving the port. Even 
spectators were able to freely observe customhouse officers' 
inspection activities nearby. The information board installed in 
the terminal was written in Korean along with English and 
Japanese. In other words, the terminal has changed into a 
sightseeing spot for South Koreans. 
  We could sense North Korea's serious food shortage even at 
Niigata port. When the repatriation of Korean residents to 
North Korea began in the past, North Korea's propaganda said 
that North Korea "will provide them with a tile-roofed house, 
silk clothes, rice, and meat soup," and the Mangyongbong 
intentionally prevented repatriates from loading their food on 
the boat. This was in order to show that North Korea "lives in 
opulence." 
  However, entering the nineties, North Korea did not prevent 
the repatriates to North Korea from bringing food with them. 
Rather, in 1991 Chongnyon waged a campaign to send foodstuffs 
for the repatriates to North Korea. What cropped up in the wake 
of this campaign was so-called "foodstuffs sets for gift." The 
foodstuffs sets were divided into three kinds of "rice set," 
"rice-cake set," and "noodle set." 
  The "rice set" contains 10 kilograms of rice, two cans of 
sesame oil, one bag (500 grams) of condiments, and one bag (one 
kilogram) of sugar. "Rice-cake set" and "noodle set" also 
contain foodstuffs such as ramyon noodles, condiments, and 
sugar. The price of each foodstuffs set is 11,000 yen. Korean 
residents in Japan who are not repatriated to North Korea, as 
well, can buy and send these foodstuffs sets to North Korea. 
  The company which deals with this business is the Kyonghwa 
Business Company in Niigata Prefecture. The Kyonghwa business 
company is located one kilometer away from Niigata port and 50 
meters away from the Chongnyon Niigata Prefecture Headquarters. 
The Kyonghwa company founded in June 1976 is operated by the 
Chongnyon Central Headquarters. The head of the Chongnyon 
Central Headquarters is Yi Chae-yong. 
  In addition to the Kyonghwa company, there are the Chongnyon 
Niigata headquarters, the Chongnyon Niigata Central Branch 
Office which is in charge of repatriating Korean residents in 
Japan to North Korea, the Choun Credit Union which is a 
Chongnyon-operated Korean bank in Japan, and the 
Chongnyon-operated Korean junior and senior high schools in 
Niigata Prefecture. Korean compatriots in Niigata number about 
2,700. Of those, Chongnyon-affiliated Korean residents are only 
about 960. The number of students at the Chongnyon-operated 
schools does not exceed 70. Mr. Kim Haeng-su, standing adviser 
to the (pro-Seoul) Federation of Korean Residents in Japan 
[Mindan], 71, said that "the number of seceders from Chongnyon 
is on the increase." 
  Chongnyon's routine life in Niigata varies according to the 
moves of the Mangyongbong. On the day when the Mangyongbong 
does not put in at the Niigata port we can see the shutters of 
the buildings of Chongnyon Niigata Central Branch Office and the 
Kyonghwa business company pulled down. We can see no one in 
these buildings, as well as in the building of the Chongnyon 
Niigata headquarters. On the contrary, when the Mangyongbong 
calls at the port the shutters open again, and the buildings 
become a houseful of people carrying baggage. The Korean 
residents belonging to Mindan were not interested in the 
Mangyongbong calling at and leaving Niigata port. 
  One day in early 1990 the Mangyongbong delayed its departure 
time for a couple of hours despite the fact that passengers and 
cargo were already on board and customhouse officers' 
inspections, as well, were finished. 
  A couple of hours later, a taxi arrived hurriedly in front 
of 
the Mangyongbong. The person who got off in a hurry from the 
taxi was a certain Yi, vice chairman of the Chongnyon 
Headquarters. He carried a briefcase. The Mangyongbong departed 
as soon as he embarked on the ship. Later, a former Chongnyon 
cadre member revealed that the delay in the Mangyongbong's 
departure at that time was because of this briefcase which 
contained money. 
  Cargo carried by the Mangyongbong is inspected at random by 
Japanese customs offices, which open and inspect about ten 
parcels selected randomly out of thousands unloaded at the port. 
They confiscate those things found to be uncleared, and clear 
everything that has no particular problem. This inspection 
system has been unchanged for a long time. 
  Japanese customs inspection is not tight because of 
government policy. The Japanese Government thoroughly controls 
the introduction of drugs and murderous weapons in the country, 
but customarily hardly interrupts people from taking them out of 
the country. Japanese law allows anyone who stays in Japan to 
carry money not exceeding five million yen without notifying the 
Ministry of Finance when departing Japan. Passengers of the 
Mangyongbong are no exception. Some people, however, criticize 
that the Japanese Government does not control the illegal 
remittance via the Mangyongbong under the situation in which the 
North Korean nuclear issue has emerged to be a worldwide issue 
because it does not want to have the extra security burden 
imposed by possible protests by Chongnyon. 
  However, a large amount of cash is hardly found inside the 
cargo. Chang Myong-su, 60, who was vice chairman of Chongnyon 
headquarters in Niigata and is working as secretary general of 
the Council for Treating Defectors from the Republic [North 
Korea] since he left Chongnyon as he felt conscientiously uneasy 
with the business of sending people to North Korea, said: 
"People do not attempt the dangerous gamble of hiding money 
inside packages because there are various ways to send money to 
North Korea." 
<H5>  The Mangyongbong Is the Source of Money for the North Korean </H5>
Regime 
  According to a common view, Chongnyon funds are dispatched 
to 
North Korea through the Mangyongbong, banks in Japan, and third 
countries. Out of these three channels, the Mangyongbong is 
known as the best for the open remittance of large amounts of 
money. 
  In 1975 North Korea began to ask Korean businessmen 
affiliated with Chongnyon to donate to the fatherland. The 
dispatch of money through the Mangyongbong also began that year. 
The late Mun Tong-kon, who was vice chairman of Chongnyon and 
was one of the special figures who made huge donations to North 
Korea. He built a 5,378-ton cargo ship worth approximately one 
billion yen and donated it to North Korea. Mun's donation was 
reported large scale in the August 1976 issue of KUMIRUI CHOSON, 
a Japan-based North Korean magazine for propagating North Korean 
affairs to Japan. The ship donated by Mun was used in 
transporting North Korean spies involved in the Aungsan 
Mausoleum incident. 
  In November 1993, THE NEW YORK TIMES reported that millions 
of yen were flowing into North Korea, hidden in suitcases and 
plastic bags carried by the Mangyongbong. Sato Kazmi [as 
transliterated], head of the Hyundai Korea Research Institute in 
Japan, said that about six million yen come into North Korea 
each year through the Mangyongbong, thus astonishing the world. 
  There are differences in opinion on the total amount of 
money 
dispatched to North Korea through the Mangyongbong. However, 
Japanese Government officials, the Institute for Studying 
Economic Issues in Asia, the East Asia Trade Institute, and the 
ROK Embassy in Japan are unanimously saying: "The estimate that 
the total remittance through the ship is six million yen is 
against common sense. The presumed amount is 1-2 million yen 
per year." 
  A former high-ranking official of Chongnyon said: "The 
Chongnyon economy is influenced by the long-term economic slump 
in Japan. The annual donation by an individual reached several 
hundred million yen before 1980, but since the beginning of 1980 
it declined and was finally reduced to tens of millions of yen 
at the end of 1980." 
  The total amount of the remittance to North Korea through 
the 
Mangyongbong is still unknown, but no one denies that this ship 
is the source of money supporting the North Korean regime as 
well as the channel for smuggling advanced technologies needed 
by North Korea. This is proven by facts that most equipment 
used by North Korean spies is made in Japan, that a Japanese 
truck made by Nissan was rebuilt as a missile launching ramp in 
North Korea, and that Pyongyang Children's Palace is decorated 
with computers from Japan's NEC. 
  A high-level source of Chongnyon has said: "The sending of 
compatriots to North Korea has greatly contributed to North 
Korea's munitions industry. To cite an example, Nikon 
lens-making technology went to North Korea in the sixties, and 
that of the semi-conductor industry went in the seventies. Such 
technologies have not been properly made use of because North 
Korea has not had its own technology to put those technologies 
into practice." 
  There is no limit as to the number of personal items to be 
loaded onto the Mangyongbong. Back in the early eighties, North 
Korea limited the cargo to four items per person so as to block 
materials of vulgar Western culture, including pornographic 
magazines, from being imported along with other cargo. Items of 
personal cargo were once limited to only two. But, since the 
end of the eighties, the limits have been lifted. This is a 
sign showing the economic difficulties facing North Korea. A 
Chongnyon-affiliated industrialist in Niigata has once even 
carried a total of 16 pieces of luggage on his way to meet his 
child who had earlier been repatriated to North Korea. 
  Chongnyon sometimes remits money to North Korea through 
banks 
in Japan. A typical bank of the kind is the Asikaga Bank. The 
bank is a regional bank in the Tochigi Prefecture and has about 
160 branches across the country. It is a main bank with which 
the Chongnyon-affiliated Choun Credit Union is in a 
correspondent relationship. The Asikaga Bank has opened a legal 
correspondent relationship with the Choson Joint-Venture Bank 
headquartered in Pyongyang. 
<H5>  Money Sent in Crisp Dollar Bank Notes on Kim Chong-il's </H5>
Birthday 
  The third method is the remittance of money through a third 
country such as China, Macao, or a Southeast Asian country. A 
former Chongnyon cadre bore testimony to this, saying: "The 
remittance through a third country is mainly done in Macao. 
Yamaguchigumi, a gang of thugs in Japan, has a base in Macao. 
Remittance is simple. A man willing to send money goes to 
Macao. He does not have to carry money when traveling. He 
borrows money from a gang of thugs on mortgage of his stationery 
assets in Japan. After the gang examines, through its 
organization in Japan, his capability for such mortgage, the 
gang lends money to him within the scope of his capability. In 
this way, a man has once remitted $500,000 at a time. 
  This route was often utilized with the approach of Kim 
Chong-il's birthday (16 February). The money to be sent to Kim 
Chong-il should be in crisp dollar bank notes. If the bank 
notes are used ones, those involved will be blamed for 
blasphemy. Therefore, they go to Macao and withdraw brand-new 
bank notes from a Macao branch of a Chinese bank. The amount of 
money is limited to $2.16 million to match the date of his birth 
[16 February]. The money is wrapped in a thin cloth, put into 
Samsonite bags, and then sent to North Korea." 
  He added that if a Chongnyon-affiliated industrialist 
complains of the difficulty in donating money, North Korea would 
even propose that "if you go to Macao, you will be introduced to 
a remitter." He went on to say: "As the amount of money sent in 
has dwindled since the early nineties, North Korea has forcibly 
demanded that Chongnyon-affiliated industrialists "donate money 
in return for being provided with North Korean zinc ingots and 
steels on a priority basis." When industrialists say "it is 
difficult to remit money due to Japanese Government 
surveillance," using this as an excuse to turn down such a 
proposal, then North Korea presented a method by saying "then, 
come to Macao, you will be introduced to a Japanese gang of 
thugs."

Investigation Agency, said in answer to a question by a Diet 
member of the Liberal Democratic Party at the House of 
Representatives's Budget Committee on 30 March: "The ways of 
remitting money to North Korea mainly consists of payments in 
trade transactions; sending money to relatives or acquaintances 
in North Korea; paid-in capital in joint venture projects; and 
donations to the Workers Party. Major ways for the remittance 
are to remit money through banks, to hand-carry money to North 
Korea, and to ask those visiting North Korea to carry it." 
  It is said that there are many other ways than using only 
the 
Mangyongbong route. For example, remittance can be carried out 
through Japanese people, not through Chongnyon routes. Because 
there are many ways like this, Japanese businessmen share the 
view that it is hard to expect any effect to come from an 
economic sanction against North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea called on 
China Tuesday to guarantee transparency in its import policy and 
to legalize the importation of South Korean automobiles. 
  Seoul also sought Beijing's understanding in minimizing 
damage from Chinese farm produce flooding the local market. 
  The two sides sat down for their second trade talks in Seoul 
led by Chong Ui-yong, director-general for international trade 
on the South Korean side, and Shi Weisan, director-general for 
Asian affairs at the Chinese foreign trade and economic 
cooperation ministry. 
  Bilateral trade totaled 9.1 billion U.S. dollars last year, 
with Korea posting a 1.2-billion-dollar surplus in direct 
exchanges. The surplus is an even larger 3.3 billion dollars, 
however, when indirect trade via third countries such as Hong 
Kong is included. 
  Officials predicted that two-way trade will increase to 28 
billion dollars by 1997 and to 50 billion dollars by the year 
2000. 
  Seoul's requests included favorable consideration for South 
Korean participation in Chinese economic development and 
construction projects. 
  Beijing responded that it will review them within possible 
boundaries, officials said. 
  China, meanwhile, sought the removal of duties on 20 
products 
subject to South Korean adjustment tariffs, including ginseng 
goods, officials here said. 
  Seoul will ask Beijing to strengthen its own quarantine 
rules 
as Chinese food and farm imports often fail to pass inspection 
at Korean customs.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The Chinese Government 
is conducting a thorough investigation into the murder of a 
South Korean businessman who was found dead in Northeastern 
China over the weekend, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said Monday. 
  "We do not want this kind of mishap to take place in China, 
although it is the kind of incident which can occur in any 
country," said Spokesman Shen Guofang at a meeting with South 
Korean reporters. 
  "The Chinese Government has taken measures to guarantee the 
safety of foreign investments here and the security of 
foreigners doing business in China, and will continue to 
reinforce such measures," said the spokesman. 
  A 53-year-old Cheju resident, So In-sok, was found dead over 
the weekend in Changchun city, Jilin Province. So's relatives 
said he journeyed to Changchun last March when several ethnic 
Koreans told him about promising business opportunities there.

  [Text] The South Korean Navy is to join RIMPAC '94, a 
five-nation joint naval exercise scheduled for May 26 to July 16 
in the western and central Pacific, the Defense Ministry 
announced yesterday. 
  Two Korean frigates are to join the 52-day joint naval 
maneuvers, in which over 60 warships including two U.S. carrier 
battle groups, 200 aircraft and 25,000 officers and sailors from 
the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan are participate. 
  RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific) drill, which began in 1971 under 
the initiative of the U.S. Navy, is intended to secure the 
safety of sea routes in the Pacific and enhance the joint 
operational capability among navies of Pacific-rim countries. 
  The drill is held once every two years and the South Korean 
Navy began to participate in 1990. In RIMPAC '92, the Korean 
unit was awarded the Top Gun award thanks to its excellent naval 
gunfire. 
  The joint naval maneuvers have nothing to do with the 
international political situation including the impasse over the 
North Korean nuclear program, said a Defense Ministry spokesman.

  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry gave 
final approval Friday to the Navy's choice of a British combat 
system for Korea's new destroyers. 
  The final contract saved Korea 22 billion won as the price 
of 
the SSCS (Surface Ship Combat System)-MK7 was cut 34 percent 
from the original offer in 1992 and revised to minimize treasury 
loss on the part of Korea, ministry officials said. 
  The advanced software system of Bae-Sema Ltd. (BSL), to be 
installed in the new warships under the KDX (Korean Destroyer 
Project) program, was selected over Germany's Cosys-200K1. 
  The Defense Ministry completely revised the screening 
process 
for the combat system when the German equipment was chosen in 
June last year despite the Navy's preference for the British 
version. 
  The fact that the British Navy already has a contract on a 
similar destroyer system that the Koreans wish to adopt and that 
the British system was estimated to have better "follow-up 
logistics support" tilted Korea toward the SSCS, the officials 
said. 
  The SSCS sets will be installed in the next-generation Navy 
destroyers, now under construction, with advanced computer 
operational capability.The project is due to be completed by 
1998.

  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- A planned meeting between 
President Kim Yong-sam and Buddhist leaders was called off on 
Friday due to objection by some reformist Buddhist leaders. 
  The Culture and Sports Ministry had arranged the meeting as 
part of the administrative move to mend discords between the 
administration and the Buddhist circles caused by the recent 
Chogye-sa incident. 
  "We had prepared for a meeting between President Kim and the 
Rev. Wolha, the new Chogye order patriarch, and other Chogye 
leaders at the suggestion of the Culture-Sports Ministry, but it 
failed to take place due to objection by some reformist 
leaders," a Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said. 
  He said Chongwadae planned to hold the meeting on next 
Monday, two days before the Buddha's coming day, Wednesday. 
  "But, some reformist Chogye leaders demanded that prior to 
the meeting, President Kim should make an apology and Home 
Minister Choe Hyong-u resign in connection with the violence at 
the Chogye temple," he said. 
  The official hinted that the administration would try to 
realize the meeting again once the inhouse situation of the 
Chogye order is put to an order. 
  Noting that dialogue is going on with Buddhist leaders in 
various channels, the official said that when an atmosphere is 
fostered through a dialogue, Buddhist leaders' meeting with the 
president will be materialized as a matter of course.

Hwa-nam and the chief assistant to the prime minister for

employees to get rid of "lameness" instead of imposing 
punishment, officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- There will be no special 
pardon for imprisoned criminals this year in commemoration of 
Buddha's birthday next week, the Justice Ministry said Sunday. 
The government will minimize the number of felons released from 
special amnesty granted during national holidays every year and 
refer the convicted criminals to the regular release on the 20th 
of every month, the Ministry said. 
  Ministry officials said the change is due to rising number 
of 
repeat offenses by those who have been released on holiday 
amnesty. There was also concern that the release of security law 
violators was weakening the seriousness of the law, they said. 
  Special holiday amnesty released approximately 100 more 
criminals than during monthly pardon. The change in government 
release is expected to reduce the number of pardoned criminals 
by 400 to 500 a year.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Minister Choe In-ki sacked three officials Saturday, 
holding them responsible for the trouble caused by the recently 
introduced law on the distribution and price stabilization of 
agro-fishery products. 
  The three are Sin Sun-u, director-general of the 
Agricultural 
Marketing Bureau, Kim Chu-su, chief of the Planning and Budget 
Division, and Choe Pu-kwan, of the Market and Price Policy 
Division, according to the spokesman. 
  The three officials failed to devise measures to ensure the 
law's smooth execution and, therefore, took responsibility for 
the trouble in which thousands of middlemen at the Karak 
Agro-Fishery Wholesale Market paralyzed the distribution system 
by boycotting their business in protest against the revised law 
banning wholesale activities by middlemen, the spokesman said. 
  The three will lose their jobs unless they are reinstated 
within three months. 
  In a statement, Minister Choe instructed all ministry 
officials to develop agro-fishery industries, warning that he 
would severely punish those who fail to perform their jobs well.

  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-pil, chairman of 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, on Friday emphasized the 
"justness" of the May 16 military coup d'etat which toppled the 
popularly created John M. Chang administration in 1961. 
  Kim, the top brain behind the coup led by Maj. Gen. Pak 
Chong-hui, said he had joined the Army and staged the coup to 
realize his dream to create a strong country where people do not 
starve. 
  Saying that prior to the coup, Korea had a pitiful economy, 
so pitiful that a visiting U.S. senator described South Korea 
and the Philippines as suckers of American blood, Kim said he 
had engineered the military coup to bring about an economic 
development which he said is prerequisite to democracy. 
  In a lecture before the third graders of Yoi-do high school 
as a one-day teacher, Kim said that thanks to the coup he 
staged, the country could attain a food self-sufficiency in the 
1960s and now people can make overseas trips freely. 
  He said some people speak as if everybody can successfully 
engineer an economic development. "In truth, it is not so, as 
you can see in the anecdote of Columbus's egg," he said. 
  Meanwhile, the United People's Party denounced Kim's remarks 
as a sophistry. 
  "We were astonished to learn that Kim made a far-fetched 
sophistry and self-centered argument about economic development 
before high school students," party spokesman Kim Su-il said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party appointed Rep. Pak Pom-chin as its new spokesman 
on Saturday. 
  The party accepted resignations handed in by Spokesman Ha 
Sun-pong and three deputy spokesmen -- Cho Yong-chik, O 
Chang-sop and Son Hak-kyu earlier in the day. 
  New deputy spokesmen are expected to be named on Monday. 
  Explaining the background of the change, DLP 
Secretary-General Mun Chong-su said, "Spokesman Ha expressed his 
intention to resign and the party accepted the resignations of 
Ha and the three deputy spokesmen to change the atmosphere in 
the spokesman's office." 
  Ha reportedly resigned assuming responsibility for the 
tension between the DLP and the Democratic Party created by his 
recent remarks that retired opposition leader Kim Tae-chung had 
covertly encouraged the opposition Democratic Party to adopt a 
hard-line stance toward the ruling party. 
  New DLP Spokesman Pak, 54, was born in Chechon-kun, North 
Chungchong Province, and graduated from the political science 
department at Seoul National University. He worked at the 
CHOSON ILBO and served as editorial writer for the SEOUL SINMUN.

  [Text] Kwangju, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Coinciding with the 14th 
anniversary of the "Kwangju civil uprising," a local group of 
victims of the bloody government suppression announced Thursday 
it would lodge a criminal complaint against former Presidents 
Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and 33 others for alleged treason and 
homicide. 
  "Ominnyon" told a news conference it would file the 
complaint 
with the Seoul district prosecutor's office Friday, adding that 
321 victims of the May 18 civil uprising will be plaintiffs in 
the complaint. 
  "We decided to file the complaint against the 35 people 
because we considered it impossible to achieve true 
democratization and harmony in the country, as well as cherish 
the spirit of the May 18 civil uprising, without eliminating 
those forces who want to dilute the spirit of the uprising to 
maintain their vested interests," said an organization spokesman. 
  "The Kim Yong-sam government cannot achieve true reform 
unless it brings to light the true picture of the massacre 
during the uprising and takes judicial action against those 
responsible for the massacre," said the spokesman, criticizing a 
situation in which the victims themselves must take legal 
action. In the meantime, an organization of bereaved families 
of the uprising's victims said in a statement that the 
anniversary should become a national event, fostering a mood in 
which President Kim and government officials could visit 
Mangwoldong cemetery where those killed in the Kwangju civil 
uprising are buried.

  [Text] Yangsan, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Over 1,000 residents of 
Chang-an, a township near Pusan, staged a sit-in early Thursday 
morning against plans to build a nuclear waste dump in the 
township, blocking roads with machinery and tires. As a result, 
some 1,500 commuters were unable to report to work in Pusan and 
Ulsan, while employees of Kori atomic power station were kept 
from their jobs. 
  Some 500 protesting citizens blocked the road to the power 
plant at 6:00 a.m. to keep over 500 station employees from 
reporting for work, forcing those on the night shift to continue 
working. Station chief Pak Sang-ki asked the police to disperse 
the demonstrators, saying the sit-in protest would cause big 
trouble for the facility. In response, the police deployed 10 
companies of 1,200 riot troopers near the station to prepare for 
any emergency. The protest also kept 760 primary and secondary 
school students from Chang-an away from their schools. 
  The sit-in was triggered by the Kori atomic power station's 
briefing on its nuclear waste dump construction plans at a 
meeting of 14 Yangsan County council members and citizens 
supporting the scheme in Chang-an on Wednesday afternoon. 
Around 8:40 p.m., angry residents gathered for a sit-in at the 
home of Sin Pong-cho, chairman of the Chang-an township 
development committee that supports construction of the nuclear 
waste dump. Sin's daughter-in-law, 29, fainted from shock at 
the sit-in protest against her father-in-law and was taken to a 
hospital for treatment.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] left Beijing for 
Pyongyang aboard a (North) Korean airways plane Tuesday [17 May] 
afternoon. 
  The three IAEA experts will conduct additional inspections 
of 
nuclear laboratories at Yongbyon, 100 km north of Pyongyang, and 
check whether nuclear fuel rods have been replaced at the 
North's 5-megawatt reactor. 
  The inspections, coming after a two-month pause, are 
important because they will determine whether the dispute over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program is referred to the United Nations 
Security Council for sanctions, or the United States and North 
Korea hold a third round of high-level talks. 
  Before departing for Pyongyang, the head of the IAEA 
inspectors stated that he can say nothing before the actual 
inspections, which will begin as soon as possible. 
  Western sources here said the IAEA experts may differ with 
North Korean officials on the scope of the inspections, but such 
disagreement will never be so serious as to block the holding of 
a third round of high-level talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang. 
  North Korea is likely to employ the two undeclared nuclear 
facilities as a final card to be used in negotiations with the 
United States and the IAEA. Whether the North accepts 
inspections of the two undeclared sites will be the final issue 
to be resolved at the negotiations, the sources said. 
  Meanwhile, the three-man IAEA team will end the first stage 
of inspections by this weekend and report the results to agency 
headquarters in Vienna. This means a decision on the third 
round of high-level dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang 
will come next week at the latest.

  [Text] Yun Ho-chin, North Korean working-level 
representative on the nuclear issue, revealed on 17 May that 
North Korea has already replaced quite a few of its burnt 
nuclear fuel rods at the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and 
that the replacement job will continue for the next two months. 
  When asked if the replacement is in the preparatory stages, 
Yun Ho-chin, councilor of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, 
stated that the replacement work has progressed to the point 
that quite a few of its nuclear fuel rods have been replaced 
after being unsealed. 
  The North Korean councilor stressed that North Korea had 
emphasized the inevitability of the replacement to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and had requested that 
IAEA inspectors observe the replacement of nuclear fuel rods on 
several occasions.

  [Text] In addition to multifaceted diplomatic efforts for 
the resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue, the ROK and the 
United States are strengthening their military preparedness by 
increasing their combined defense capabilities in preparation 
against the possibility of North Korea's armed provocation 
against the South. In particular, it has been confirmed that the 
armed forces of the ROK and the United States have been able to 
pinpoint the location of about 2,300 multiple-barrelled rocket 
launchers North Korea has deployed underground along the 
ceasefire line, and that they have secured new shells which can 
destroy such launchers. 
  On 17 May one high-level military official in the government 
said: "We have stockpiled special shells, including laser-beam 
guided missiles, which can neutralize North Korea's underground 
gun batteries which pose a big threat to Seoul and its 
vicinity." He continued to say that such new shells are capable 
of destroying concrete walls that are more than two meters thick. 
  This official added: "The U.S. Armed Forces are developing 
higher accuracy equipment which can destroy such underground 
batteries with improved accuracy. Existing equipment is 
sufficient for keeping a check on North Korea's underground 
batteries." 
  In the meantime, as far as diplomatic efforts are concerned, 
the ROK and the United States have reportedly worked out a 
step-by-step way of imposing sanctions in such a way as to 
immediately refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN 
Security Council if the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] reports that it is difficult to verify whether nuclear 
material has been taken because of North Korea's replacement of 
nuclear fuel rods. 
  If imposing sanctions against North Korea is impossible with 
China's exercise of its veto power, an international joint 
sanction between the ROK, the United States, and Japan may be 
imposed. It has been learned that with a view to increasing the 
efficiency of the sanctions, the ROK Government is devising a 
way to have Russia join in the sanctions against North Korea. 
  As part of this strategy, the government will make efforts 
to 
see an adoption of a ROK-Russian joint statement or joint 
declaration on the basis of the denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula during President Kim Yong-sam's visit in Russia in 
early June. 
  On 17 May, a high-level government official stressed: "If 
there is a report from the IAEA team saying that it is 
impossible to secure nuclear transparency because North Korea 
has already replaced its nuclear fuel rods, referral of this 
matter to the UN Security Council and following through on 
procedures to impose sanctions will be inevitable."

  [Text] On 16 May Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the 
National Unification Board, said: "The goal of resolving the 
nuclear issue is to completely scrap North Korea's nuclear 
weapons -- if it is proven it possess them." 
  At the third 1994 Advisory Conference for National 
Unification held that day at the Secretariat for the South-North 
talks in Samchong-dong, Seoul, he presented a report entitled: 
"The Status of Recent Developments in South-North Relations and 
the Direction of Countermeasures." He said: "The ultimate goal 
of resolving the nuclear issue is not only to check North 
Korea's nuclear development, but also to seek a complete 
scrapping of nuclear weapons in case North Korea should possess 
them." 
  Such a report by Vice Minister Song is noteworthy in that it 
was disclosed at a time when some circles are stressing the need 
to tolerate [mukin] North Korea in case it has developed a small 
amount of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Han Tong-su] </F>
  [Text] Former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung's remarks 
seemingly permissive of the North Korean nuclear program have 
touched off controversy with the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
[DLP] demanding the government clarify its position on the issue. 
  In an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim, now visiting 
the United States, said that even if Pyongyang possessed "two or 
three atomic bombs," it would not be much of a problem compared 
with the 20,000 nuclear warheads that the U.S. has. 
  Kim's remarks are in sharp contrast with the government's 
official policy, which was expounded by Deputy 
Premier-Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku at the Korean Newspapers 
Editors Association's breakfast meeting on March 12. Yi told 
the editors, "If North Korea develops even one half of a nuclear 
bomb, the declaration of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula will be 
scrapped." 
  DLP officials said Kim's remarks sound like support for 
North 
Korea's possession of nuclear weapons, adding that they may 
jeopardize the ongoing international efforts to stop the 
dangerous nuclear game. 
  Kim Tae-chung's Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, meanwhile, 
argued that Kim's remarks were quoted out of context, saying 
that Kim made the remarks to stress the futility of North 
Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons. 
  In a meeting of DLP key post holders, senior party officials 
expressed grave worry that Kim's "irresponsible" remarks may 
embolden North Korea which undoubtedly has nuclear ambitions. 
  DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin said, "Kim's remarks will confuse 
the government's North Korean policy and create uneasiness among 
the people." 
  Chief policymaker Yi Se-ki said that he can hardly 
understand 
why Kim made the "unthinkable" remarks at a time when the entire 
nation and international community are striving to stop the 
North Korean nuclear program. 
  DLP leaders decided to request that the National Unification 
Board issue a statement clarifying the government's formal 
position in connection with Kim's controversial remarks. 
  They also took issue with Kim's remarks at Washington's 
National Press Club advising U.S. President Bill Clinton to 
invite Kim Il- song to the United States and to send former 
president Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang as a special emissary. 
  DLP officials accused Kim of engaging in political activity, 
reneging on his earlier statement that he had quit politics for 
good after his presidential election defeat. If he wants to 
re-enter politics, he should make a formal announcement, they 
argued. 
  The opposition Democratic Party [DP] and Kim's Asia-Pacific 
Peace Foundation, meanwhile, tried to cool down the controversy, 
issuing statements saying that Kim's remarks had been 
misinterpreted. 
  DP deputy spokesman Sol Hun said that Kim has insisted on 
North Korea's not having nuclear weapons under any 
circumstances. "With his latest comments, Kim only wanted to 
stress that it is foolish for Pyongyang to possess such 
weapons," he added.

  [Text] Washington, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung's 
Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation on Monday clarified the former 
opposition Democratic Party [DP] chairman's remarks about North 
Korea's possible possession of nuclear weapons, which have been 
causing a stir in South Korean political circles. 
  In an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim Tae-chung, 
who 
is visiting the United States, reportedly said that North 
Korea's possession of two or three nuclear bombs is nothing 
compared with the Western world which has more than 20,000. 
  Kim's comment was interpreted in South Korea as meaning that 
it would not pose much of a problem even if Pyongyang had two or 
three nuclear bombs. 
  The remark created shock waves in Seoul since it came only 
days after the minister of the National Unification Board (NUB), 
Yi Hong- ku, said if Pyongyang developed or had "even one-half 
of a nuclear bomb," it would be regarded by Seoul as nullifying 
the inter-Korean denuclearization declaration. 
  "Below the statement in question is an underlying principle 
that North Korea should not develop nuclear weapons under any 
circumstances," said the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation. 
  Yi yong-chak, director of the foundation's Washington 
office, 
said Kim made the remark in response to a WASHINGTON TIMES 
interviewer's question on whether the United States should not 
redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea if the international 
community could not stop North Korea from developing nuclear 
arms. 
  Yi said Kim Tae-chung replied to the question by saying that 
it would be meaningless to redeploy nuclear weapons in South 
Korea. 
  Under circumstances where the United States has several tens 
of hundreds of nuclear bombs, it would mean nothing even if 
North Korea came to possess two or three atomic weapons, Kim 
Tae-chung was quoted by Yi as telling THE WASHINGTON TIMES. 
  Kim said he opposed the redeployment of nuclear weapons in 
South Korea, according to Yi. 
  Kim stated further that if North Korea managed to acquire 
nuclear weapons, it could never establish diplomatic relations 
with the United States and other Western countries. They would 
be of no help to North Korea either, Kim added. 
  The strong reaction to Kim's statement in South Korea was 
prompted by press reports that took his remarks out of context, 
Yi said. 
  In its report, THE WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Kim as saying 
that 
even if Pyongyang has nuclear weapons, they would be useless if 
"we don't attack North Korea." 
  Kim was also reported to have said the no. 1 priority for 
North Korea is not developing nuclear weapons but improving 
relations with the United States. 
  Washington should offer to establish diplomatic relations 
with Pyongyang as well as security guarantees as part of a 
package deal, Kim said. 
  If North Korea rejected such a proposal, then China would 
join U.N. sanctions against its neighbor, Kim predicted.

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku on Tuesday regretted the remarks made recently by Kim 
Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, with 
respect to the North Korean nuclear question. 
  "I regret that chairman Kim made remarks of a kind not 
fitting to a government policy and our public sentiments, 
causing various problems," Yi said. 
  Kim is said to have stated during his stay in the United 
States that even if North Korea possesses several nuclear bombs, 
it doesn't pose any problem. 
  In a comment, Deputy Premier Yi who is also national 
unification minister said that if North Korea comes to have any 
nuclear arms, military and political balance between South and 
North Korea would be shattered outright, bringing about a 
serious problem to the national security of South Korea. 
  "Our government stand is that North Korea should not possess 
even a single nuclear weapon and that if they have any, it 
should be destroyed under all circumstances," Yi said. 
  The deputy prime minister also rejected as "improper" Kim 
Tae-chung's idea of inviting Kim Il-song to the United States 
and sending Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as 
a special envoy. His proposition cannot be of any help to the 
government policy of resolving inter-Korean issues through talks 
between the direct parties involved, namely, South and North 
Korea, Yi said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Six in every 10 South 
Korean adults believe there is the danger of North Korea 
provoking a war on the Korean peninsula, an opinion survey said 
Monday. The poll, taken by the Korea Gallup Co., showed that 
11.8 percent of the pollees replied they believe there is much 
danger of a war being unleashed by the North kroeans and another 
46.1 percent said they think there is slight danger of such war. 
  The survey, conducted in a contract awarded by the 
Information Ministry, was made toward 1,000 people aged 20 or 
more across the country on may 2-3. Of the respondents, 37.0 
percent said they don't see any danger of North Korea provoking 
a war. The percentage of those who denied war danger was high, 
54.4 percent, among those with college or higher educational 
background. 
  As reasons for denial of the danger of war, 16.9 percent 
gave 
the flow of international situation against war, 12.2 percent 
lack of economic strength to wage a war on the part of North 
Korea, and 10.9 percent the North's inability to fight a war on 
their own. 
  As to the fate of the Kim Il-song system, 33.6 percent said 
they think the system would survive while 66.7 percent replied 
it would collapse either gradually or in the foreseeable future. 
  Asked if they think North Korea would open itself up, 7.5 
percent said it would open totally, 61.3 percent it would 
partially, and 27.2 percent it wouldn't open at all. 
  On the question of whether to resume the Team Spirit 
exercise, 45.7 percent said the training should be held 
regardless of North Korea's attitude and 35.0 percent said 
decision on the issue should be made depending on North Korea's 
attitude. Only 19.3 percent said they think the exercise 
shouldn't be held regardless of the attitude of North Korea. 
  Concerning the nuclear question, 39.1 percent said they 
believe North Korea has already developed nuclear weapons, and 
21.9 percent North Korea is in the threshold of developing them. 
Mere 3 percent said they believe North Korea has no ability at 
all to produce nuclear weapons. 
  Of the total pollees, 85.1 percent said they think North 
Korea's human rights conditions are very serious, and 93.4 
percent said North Korea is experiencing a difficult economic 
situation. 
  Meanwhile, 69.7 percent of the pollees supported the 
government policy of accepting North Korean loggers in Siberia. 
About North Korean escapees in China, 40.9 percent said South 
Korea should accept them while 22.6 percent said the government 
should help them resettle in China or other third countries. 
Another 29.2 percent said the matter should be handled very 
prudently taking into account China-North Korea relations, and 
only 6.2 percent said South Korea shouldn't accept them.

  [Text] On 9 May, Kang Yong-hun, president of the ROK 
National Red Cross, proposed resuming North-South Red Cross 
talks to North Korea to exchange visiting groups of separated 
families and elderly parents and resolve the overall separated 
families issues. 
  President Kang Yong-hun asked the North Korean authorities 
to 
return approximately 400 persons who had been detained in North 
Korea, including the crew of the Tongjin boat and those of 
civilian airplanes, to their families' embraces. He proposed 
this during a speech to today's meeting marking the Day of 
International Red Cross. 
  He also said that reuniting members of separated families is 
a moral issue that transcends differences in ideology and 
systems and is a central point of humanitarianism. He also said 
that the North and South Red Cross Societies must start 
consultations on this matter as soon as possible. 
  President Kang Yong-hun also said that Ham Se-hwan and Kim 
In-so, whom North Korea had asked the ROK to return, are not 
POW's but ROK citizens. He also said that demanding their 
repatriation is not in compliance with Red Cross humanitarianism.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has already 
brought a large number of loggers back home from Siberia and the 
withdrawal operation is continuing, it was reported Tuesday. 
  A senior South Korean Government official said that the 
number of North Korean loggers in Siberia, which has been as 
high as 20,000, is currently estimated at only 7,000 to 8,000. 
  "The withdrawal operation became active from the beginning 
of 
this year and it is continuing as the Seoul government has 
decided to allow fleeing North Korean loggers to settle in South 
Korea," the official said, requesting anonymity. 
  The withdrawal could also be attributed to either a decline 
in seasonal demand or to a delay in the renewal of the North 
Korean-Russian logging agreement, he said. 
  The official said he could not say whether Pyongyang's 
action 
had anything to do with the Seoul government's decision to 
resettle all willing loggers in the South and Moscow's agreement 
to support the South Korean move.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- A civil organization was 
formed Tuesday to support North Koreans who have fled to China 
or who are working as loggers in Siberia. 
  The "Headquarters of Movement for Helping Brethren Fleeing 
North Korea" was officially inaugurated in a founding rally 
attended by nearly 300 persons including lawyer O Chae-to, Chong 
Nam-yol, president of the Association of Protestant Orders, and 
Song Won-yong, a former lawmaker, at Kodang (Cho Man-sik) 
Memorial Hall in central Seoul. 
  The group said, "North Koreans who fled to China to avoid 
human rights suppression and adversities and North Korean 
loggers in Siberia do not receive any adequate protection from 
the Chinese Government and the Russian Government, let alone the 
South Korean Government. 
  "It's about time we, citizens, began a pan-national movement 
to bring them and help them settle here." 
  The organization said it will begin with a fact-finding 
survey of the North Koreans in flight in Russia and China, ask 
the Russian and Chinese Governments to provide humanitarian 
assistance to them and start gathering funds to held them settle 
here.

    [Editorial Report] The Seoul daily HANGUK ILBO on 4 April 
publishes on page 23 a report on North Korean investment in 
recreational facilities. The report claimed that in order to 
ease the rising social tension, the Pyongyang government has 
invested in leisure facilities such as karaoke music rooms and 
sports centers including a huge bowling center in Pyongyang. 
  On 25 February, Kim Il-song personally visited the newly 
opened Pyongyang Bowling Center and expressed his pleasure with 
the facilities. The bowling center, 40 lanes in a 14,300 square 
meter space, was built with the help of the Chochongyon 
[Association of pro-North Korean residents in Japan] Chamber of 
Commerce. It is a complete recreation center with a large 
restaurant, saunas and various activity rooms. 
  Since opening its first karaoke music room in Pyongyang in 
1992, a large number of music rooms have been opened and are 
being opened throughout North Korea. 
  Recreation and sports complexes are under going major 
renovations. A sports, culture and rest center in Nungnado in 
Pyongyang will have eight tennis courts, a roller rink, an 
archery center, a golf practice area and badminton courts, and 
so on when renovation is completed. A sports center in 
Panwoldo, also in Pyongyang, is adding water sports facilities; 
a water play area for kindergarden children, a swimming pool for 
children and a swimming pool for students. 
  A new facility called "The All-Around Leisure Center," 
located in the Munsu area of eastern Pyongyang, is nearly ready. 
This center has been heavily advertised in the North Korean 
media as a new type of recreation center with all kinds of 
recreation facilities. It is expected to have sky rides, 
high-tech swings and other advanced amusement rides, and a 
summer land with various water recreation facilities. 
  Additionally, 26 huge theaters were built since early 1993, 
adding to the already existing 1,000 or so theaters. According 
to the North Korean media, most of these were built in the North 
Hwanghae Province and North Pyongan Province. These theaters 
can be used for movies, plays, operas, musicals and circuses. 
  North Korea has only one golf course and it is located in 
Nampo city. The greens fee is very high; 3,000 Japanese yen for 
members and 10,000 yen for non-members. It appears that North 
Korea has no plan to build new golf courses. 
  It is the Seoul government's view that North Korea is 
sensing 
social tension which could lead to major unrest. Thus, 
Pyongyang has to do something for the people and it is spending 
money, of which it has very little to spare, to build leisure 
facilities for them.

Peaceful Unification] 
  [Text] 
1. Mythicizing Birthplace 
  Kim Chong-il has consolidated his position so much that, 
despite the fact that Kim Il-song is still alive, the present 
period in North Korea may be called "the Kim Chong-il era." 
  Lately Kim Il-song himself has ordered all North Koreans to 
be loyal to the Kim Chong-il leadership and in response people 
have been continually holding various events throughout North 
Korea to renew their pledges to faithfully uphold the Kim 
Chong-il leadership. 
  Along with these events, a propaganda campaign has been in 
progress among the North Korean population to idolize Kim 
Chong-il, highlighting his leadership capability and his 
greatness. 
  This campaign for a cult of personality is being waged on 
the same level as that for Kim Il-song. It was not until Kim 
Chong-il was named to such key posts as Political Bureau 
Standing Committee member and member of the Military Affairs 
Committee at the Sixth WPK Congress in October 1980, thereby 
securing his mantle as future successor, that the idolatry 
campaign moved into high gear. 
  Below I will examine the substance of each pattern in the 
propaganda campaign being waged among the North Korean populace 
to idolize Kim Chong-il in terms of his "leadership quality and 
greatness" by looking into specific examples. 
  The idolization of Kim Chong-il began with the falsification 
of his birthplace. 
  Kim Chong-il was born on 15 February 1942 [date as 
published] in a small village called (Vatskoy) near the Amur 
River basin in the Siberian tundra region. But, in the early 
part of the 1980's, a myth was concocted claiming that Kim 
Chong-il was "born in a secret camp on Mt. Paektu" and endowed 
with the spirit of that mountain. 
  The claim that he was born on Mt. Paektu, despite his actual 
birth in the Soviet Union, is of great significance. 
  Mt. Paektu is known as our nation's holy mountain, as the 
origin point of our race. It symbolizes the spirit of our 
nation, cherished by all our people. That is why Kim Il-song 
refers to Mt. Paektu each time he talks about his revolutionary 
activities against Japan. He embellishes his achievements with 
the words "the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu." 
  North Korea fabricated the story that Kim Chong-il was born 
in a secret camp in the forests of Mt. Paektu that reverberated 
with the gunshots of the armed struggle against the Japanese. 
The purpose of this myth was to suggest that he was destined to 
succeed Kim Il-song and thus produce the propaganda effect of 
highlighting the legitimacy of his leadership and authority, as 
well as his image as the leader of not just the North Koreans 
but of all our nation. 
  To back up the false claim about Kim Chong-il's birthplace, 
North Korea, beginning in the early 1970's, expanded or 
remodeled the 30 or more of the revolution's historical 
battlefields in the Paektu mountains and other places such as 
Pochonbo, Musan, Samjiyon, and Taehungdan. At the same time, 
North Korea created various relics to substantiate the myth 
surrounding his birth--the story that in the middle of the 
guerrilla war Kim Il-song was waging, Kim Chong-il was born in a 
"log cabin" in one of the numerous secret camps in the Paektu 
mountains, and bears the spirit of Mt. Paektu. 
  These symbolic relics, known as "the revolution's historical 
sites of Paektu secret camps," include the sites of 10 or more 
secret camps, including "the Changbaek Mountain secret camp," 
"the Kowon Mountain secret camp," "the Kabaek Mountain secret 
camp," and "the Sajabong secret camp"; more than 40 log cabins; 
the more than 200 "camp fire sites" that North Korea claims have 
been recently uncovered; and thousands of trees bearing slogans. 
  Typical of these symbolic relics supposedly associated with 
Kim Chong-il in particular are the Paektu Mountain secret camp, 
in which North Korea claims he spent his childhood, and what 
they call "Chongilbong" in the Paektu mountains. In this way 
North Korea fabricated stories about Kim Chong-il's birth and 
childhood in order to embellish them to the highest possible 
degree. This fabrication and embellishment is part of the 
campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il without regard to the facts. 
<H5>  2. Process of Change in Titles </H5>
  Since Kim Chong-il came of age, the focus of propaganda has 
been on his leadership quality and greatness. 
  First of all, the flowery titles preceding his name have 
changed. At the Sixth Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee 
in December 1972, North Korea tentatively chose Kim Chong-il as 
future successor to power. Subsequently, the Seventh Plenum of 
the Fifth WPK Central Committee in September 1973 named Kim 
Chong-il as party secretary in charge of organization and 
propaganda and agitation and as candidate member of the party 
Political Bureau. From then on North Korea called him "the Party 
Center," and has used more than 30 titles to describe him for 
these past 20 years. 
  To be more specific, from September 1973 North Korea used 
the title "the Party Center" for Kim Chong-il until June 1975, 
when it designated his birthday as an official holiday and began 
to call him "the unitary leader." North Korea did not bring Kim 
Chong-il's name to the forefront, however. 
  Beginning in 1980 Kim Chong-il's titles took on a feature 
distinctively different from previous ones. From that year on 
Kim Chong-il's stature rose in terms of his titles by one peg on 
each succeeding birthday. In most cases, various flowery words 
describing the perfect features a leader should have were placed 
before the honorific "Dear Leader Kim Chong-il" to emphasize his 
greatness. 
  The titles used in those days include: "the Helmsman," "the 
Supreme Commander," "the Father of the People," and "the Great 
Guide." 
  Beginning in the early 1990's, titles comparable to those 
previously reserved for Kim Il-song appeared for Kim Chong-il, 
suggesting that the latter is at the zenith of power in North 
Korea. To give some examples of these titles: "the Leader of 
the Revolution Responsible for the Fate of our People," "the 
Great Leader," and "the Dear (and Respected) Father." 
  The idolatry campaign under way as part of a scheme to 
enhance the image of Kim Chong-il's leadership quality and 
authority includes propaganda about various instructions given 
during his "on-the-spot guidance" tours as well as tributes to 
his achievements through studies of his writings. 
  Beginning with his May 1981 visit to the Mt. Myohyang area 
development project, accompanying Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il 
visited major project sites to give what they call "practical 
guidance," during which he gave various instructions. Beginning 
in the latter part of the 1980's, the words "on-the-spot 
guidance," which had theretofore been reserved only for Kim 
Il-song's inspection tours, began to be used for Kim Chong-il's 
inspection tours also. 
  Until recently Kim Chong-il conducted more than 60 
on-the-spot guidance tours. More than 60 percent of them were 
concentrated on the light industry sector and public service 
facilities associated with the people's daily lives. This, it 
seems, is aimed at highlighting his image as the benevolent 
"father of the people" who is concerned about improving the 
living standard of the people. 
<H5>  3. 1,600 Poems Written </H5>
  To illuminate Kim Chong-il's image as "the leader with 
ideology and theories," North Korea has released or published 
writings attributed to him and stepped up a campaign to explain 
these writings through various propaganda media and discussion 
meetings. For instance, North Korea mobilizes cadres at party 
cadre training centers and various other 
organizations--publishing educational, scientific, literary, and 
art works--throughout the country to organize national seminars 
to praise the contents of his writings in each field or sends 
out party cadres and propaganda and agitation functionaries to 
various organizations and groups at all levels to explain and 
publicize his writings in the form of question-and-answer study 
sessions, explanation sessions, and discussion meetings. The 
main focus of the idolatry campaign centering on his writings is 
the theme that Kim Chong-il has inherited and developed Kim 
Il-song's ideology and theories. This puts the spotlight on Kim 
Chong-il's achievements in party building efforts and in the 
cause of the revolution. 
  In addition, North Korea is publishing reams of books and 
literary works paying tribute to Kim Chong-il's "greatness" and 
his "brilliant achievements" and is popularizing songs praising 
him in a big way. It is also encouraging ordinary citizens to 
write poems paying tribute to Kim Chong-il. According to North 
Korean propaganda, more than 1,600 poems were written for the 
six-month period between April 1992, the month Kim Chong-il 
became a marshal, and October 1992. 
  Recently, on the second anniversary of Kim Chong-il's 
appointment as supreme commander of the Korean People's Army 
[KPA], efforts were being made to write literary works designed 
to publicize Kim Chong-il's military leadership capability. 
North Korea is also concentrating its effort on idolizing Kim 
Chong-il through its education system. 
  Courses on collected materials idolizing Kim Chong-il are 
given in schools at various levels. A course named "chinhyokkwa" 
(short form for the course on the history of the dear leader Kim 
Chong-il's revolutionary activity) has been created in teachers 
colleges to provide special education regarding him. 
  The following are school subjects at different levels of 
education designed to idolize Kim Chong-il: At the primary and 
secondary school levels, students in primary schools are 
required to take 152 hours of lessons in a four-year period of 
the course titled "the childhood of the dear master Kim 
Chong-il". Students in higher middle schools in a six-year 
period are required to take 112 hours of lessons in the course 
titled "the revolutionary activities of the dear leader Kim 
Chong-il" and 110 hours of lessons in the course named "the 
history of the dear master Kim Chong-il." 
  The contents of textbooks include materials idolizing Kim 
Chong-il in almost every subject, including the Korean language 
and mathematics. Thirty four out of the 236 credits in Korean 
language and Korean literature courses, and 26 of the 169 songs 
in music textbooks, have something to do with the idolization of 
Kim Chong-il. 
  In higher education, the History Department of Kim Il-song 
University used to offer "the history of the revolution course," 
but the course is now divided into two parts, namely, "the Kim 
Il-song course" and "the Kim Chong-il course," presumably as 
part of the effort to highlight Kim Chong-il's greatness. 
  Beginning in 1987, the "Chinhyokkwa" course was created in 
teachers colleges, including Kim Hyong-chik Teachers College. 
Only 20 to 50 students from each school are allowed to enroll 
for the "Chinhyokkwa" each year. The education department of 
each county people's committee selects students for this course 
from among discharged KPA soldiers who are sound in ideology and 
have more than three years of social experience. In the 
selection process, more weight is given to family background 
than to ability. The first graduating classes of August 1991 
became guidance workers in party or government organizations 
dealing with organization and guidance or propaganda and 
agitation or in provincial or county chapters of the Leagues of 
Socialist Working Youth, whereas ordinary teachers college 
graduates just became teachers. Graduates of the "Chinhyokkwa" 
course concentrate their indoctrination efforts on government 
employees and factory and other workers to idolize Kim Chong-il. 
<H5>  4. 12 Revolution's Historical Sites </H5>
  North Korea is waging a campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il not 
only through teachers but also by means of various symbolic 
media. The latter category includes: creation of the 
revolution's historical sites; fabrication of slogan-bearing 
trees; publication of collected legends and Kim Chong-il 
anecdotes; and carved words from Quotations from Kim 
Chong-il and inscription of his name on the rocks on Mt. 
Kumgang and other famous mountains. 
  As part of the Kim Chong-il cult, North Korea has fabricated 
the revolution's historical sites. Beginning with the 
fabrication in 1982 of "our historical site of the revolution," 
where Kim Chong-il is said to have grown up, North Korea built 
12 historical sites. They are mostly associated with Kim 
Chong-il's birthplace and the places where Kim Chong-il took 
refuge during the Korean War, where he camped when he was a 
student at Kim Il-song University, or where he gave guidance in 
the countryside. 
  Each year 100,000 to 200,000 people are mobilized to visit 
these historical sites. Visitors plant commemorative trees as a 
token of their loyalty to Kim Chong-il and hold meetings to 
publish songs of loyalty and recite poems. 
  As for slogan-bearing trees (During the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle, partisan fighters stripped trees to 
write slogans on their bark), North Korean propaganda claims 
that it began to uncover these trees in a big way beginning in 
May 1987. Recently, slogan-bearing trees have been used actively 
in Kim Chong-il's image making. North Korea claims that more 
than 200 such trees have been uncovered that are associated with 
his "birth." 
  The publication of collected legends is aimed at fabricating 
legends and anecdotes on a par with those associated with Kim 
Il-song as part of the effort to offset Kim Chong-il's total 
lack of "revolutionary experience" similar to the guerrilla 
warfare waged by Kim Il-song. 
<H5>  5. History Research Center as Fabricator </H5>
  The History Research Institute under the Academy of Social 
Sciences, the veritable delivery room for campaign materials 
used in the idolization of Kim Chong-il, is the place where his 
anecdotes are fabricated. This institute fabricates legends and 
anecdotes about Kim Chong-il's birth and upbringing. These 
legends and anecdotes circulate first by word of mouth by 
functionaries responsible for such publicity, and after a 
certain interval a full-fledged propaganda campaign is launched 
through propaganda media. Recently, books on these legends and 
anecdotes have been compiled. 
  The stories titled Selected Legends of the Paektu 
Bright Star are full of such absurd stories as: Kim 
Chong-il "captured the four Taedong River dragons, which used to 
cause damage to Pyongyang residents, and built the West Sea 
Mirim Floodgate with them"; "South Korean flood victims cooked 
two potfuls of steamed rice with a handful of rice out of the 
relief rice package sent from the North in 1984"; and "a 
resident in a village of cardboard homes in the suburbs of Seoul 
planted the rice he had received as a relief item, and one of 
the rice plants grew into a huge rice-bearing tree, from which 
he harvested 10 bags of rice." 
  "The Kim Chong-il flower" besides Mt. Chongilbong is 
considered a major symbol in idolizing Kim Chong-il. It was 
introduced for the first time on the occasion of his 46th 
birthday in February 1988. 
  The owner of a Japanese flower garden is said to have 
succeeded in developing this flower after a long period of 
experimentation, and presented it as a gift. It is even called 
the flower of immortality. 
  While publicizing this flower on a grand scale, North Korea 
encouraged its cultivation and proliferation. In this process 
North Korea created the Song of the Kim Chong-il Flower and is 
now engaged in an all-out campaign to popularize the song among 
its people everywhere, not only in factories and enterprises but 
even in buses and trains. Singing sessions are being held to 
explain the words of the song, to memorize them, and to sing it 
in chorus. 
  As "a symbol of the firm determination of our people to 
admire and follow our leader, who has accumulated immortal 
achievements for our times and for the cause of revolution," 
North Korea has carved words from Quotations from Kim 
Chong-il and his name on the liffs and rocks of Mt. Paektu, 
Mt. Kumgang, and other famous mountains as part of the idolatry 
campaign. It is sending large groups of workers, students, and 
residents to the places where these carvings were done to 
organize explanation sessions, meetings on the sands [morae 
moim], and loyalty meetings to pledge full loyalty to Kim 
Chong-il. 
  To cite some examples of such carvings: the words 
"Chongilbong" on Mt. Paektu; on Mt Kumgang, the words "Kim 
Chong-il, the honor of Korea, the pride of the nation," "Kim 
Chong-il, chuche-based lodestar," and "Dedicate Mt. Kumgang, the 
scenic masterpiece, to Kim Chong-il," etc. 
  The propaganda campaign on Kim Chong-il's great successes 
and achievements is not limited to North Korea, but expands into 
overseas. 
  The main propaganda formats used in the overseas propaganda 
campaign on Kim Chong-il since the Sixth WPK Congress in 
October 1980 are: propaganda through foreign press media; 
overseas publication and dissemination of writings of Kim 
Chong-il; naming of foreign roads and buildings after Kim 
Chong-il; and having pro-North Korean writers publish articles 
in praise of Kim Chong-il. In addition, various events are 
organized overseas through pro-North Korean groups to praise Kim 
Chong-il. The press plays the key role in overseas propaganda 
campaigns to idolize Kim Chong-il. The following describes the 
depth of such overseas propaganda campaigns as publicized by 
North Korea: 
  On 5 December 1989 the North Korean Central Broadcasting 
Station said that newspapers, magazines, and other publications 
in 85 countries had printed articles featuring the greatness of 
Kim Chong-il over a five-year period. And NODONG SINMUN on 9 
March 1992 claimed that more than 420 publications in 80 or more 
countries introduced Kim Chong-il's achievements in honor of his 
50th birthday. 
  As the main themes of propaganda conducted through 
newspapers, broadcasts, and other media, "What kind of person is 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people?" and 
"His Excellency Kim Chong-il, the source of inspiration for the 
Korean people" may be mentioned. 
<H5>  6. Over 400 Pieces of Propaganda Literature </H5>
  North Korea is pushing the overseas publication and 
dissemination of Kim Chong-il's writings on a grand scale. It 
claims that on the occasion of Kim Chong-il's 50th birthday in 
February 1992, more than 400 of Kim Chong-il's writings were 
compiled in book form and tens of millions of them have been 
published overseas. They include: On Some Questions 
Arising in Indoctrination in the Chuche Ideology (July 
1987) and Let Us March Forward Vigorously on the Road of 
Socialism and Communism Holding High the Banner of the 
Anti-Imperialist Struggle! (September 1987), in addition 
to Selected Works of Kim Chong-il, Vol. I. 
  Pro-North Korean organizations, such as "study groups for 
research into Comrade Kim Il-song's chuche ideology" and 
"chuche Ideology research centers" are mobilized to hold forums 
and seminars on Kim Chong-il's genealogy and other subjects. 
  Some of the roads and buildings in African and Latin 
American countries have been named after Kim Chong-il. Most of 
these roads and buildings were constructed with North Korean 
aid. For instance, Pabo Street in (Koriberton) in Guyana is 
renamed as "Kim Chong-il Street"; an Indian library building as 
"Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il Library"; and a ninth grade class in 
the Kudus School in Tunisia as "the Kim Chong-il classroom." 
Such cases are said to total more than 20. 
  North Korea also has pro-North Korean foreign writers create 
literary works depicting the greatness of Kim Chong-il and 
other pieces and publish them on occasions like his birthday. 
  The purpose of the overseas campaigns on Kim Chong-il is not 
aimed at propaganda effects overseas but rather is intended for 
the feedback of the "fabricated results" gained through the 
process of such campaigns and publicize them at home so that 
they may give the North Koreans the impression that Kim Chong-il 
is also recognized overseas as a capable leader. 
  One thing that we can not omit in noting the thrust of the 
campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il is the false claim that "the 
South Korean people admire Kim Chong-il." 
  Beginning in 1987, as part of the measures to consolidate 
the Kim Chong-il leadership structure, North Korean 
intermittently published false reports that "the South Korean 
people" also admire and respect Kim Chong-il. Recently, the 
frequency of such reports has shown a tendency to rise. 
  In the past North Korea carried such reports mainly through 
Radio Pyongyang, a propaganda radio beamed to South Korea. But 
recently domestic news media such as the Central Broadcasting 
Station--the domestic radio station--and newspapers like NODONG 
SINMUN and MINJU CHOSON also have been making similar claims. 
North Korean media claim that contrary to the past, South Korean 
people in all strata and all walks of life, including 
intellectuals, workers, artists, and students, now respect and 
admire Kim Chong-il. 
  North Korean propaganda stresses that South Koreans are 
saying that "it is fortunate for our nation to have Kim Chong-il 
as future president"-- a claim designed to drive home to the 
North Koreans that the South Korean people view Kim Chong-il's 
succession to power as an accomplished fact. 
  As you see, the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il has been 
pushed on an extensive scale and in various forms. 
  This phenomenon culminated in unprecedented happenings for 
all ages and countries, such as Kim Il-song sending a gift of 
Chinese poems to Kim Chong-il praising his own son and Yi In-mo 
writing a poem in praise of Kim Chong-il. 
  In the future the campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il is 
expected to intensify in conjunction with the consolidation of 
his leadership.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Chon Hyon-chun, lecturer at Sukmyong Women's </F>
University] 
  [Excerpts] There are two extremes of opinion regarding Kim 
Chong-il. At the one extreme critics say that he is quite 
capable of making reasonable choices thanks to his more than 20 
years of experience in public life whereas the opposite 
opinion says that he is emotionally unstable and haphazard, 
acts on the spur of the moment, and is unreasonable in 
character. In reality, it is difficult to say which of these is 
accurate because of the paucity of information, a common 
difficulty encountered in research on North Korea. Therefore, 
any attempt to evaluate Kim Chong-il is full of pitfalls. 
Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that Kim Chong-il is quite 
capable of making choices in the "North Korean style" on the 
strength of his long practical experience and with the 
assistance of his staff, limited as it is. Of course, this is 
not to say that I take at face value the overestimation of the 
existing arrangement for the succession on the one hand and 
his ability on the other. 

<H5>    1. Overly Packaged Kim Chong-il's Birth </H5>
  In the past North Korea overly embellished Kim Chong-il's 
image and publicized his blown up image instead of letting 
people know about him as he is. The key point in the succession 
in North Korea is whether the successor will secure his 
authority as the leader. For this reason, North Korea has been 
doing everything possible to groom Kim Chong-il. In this effort 
North Korea used books and NODONG SINMUN and other news media 
as major tools. As mentioned earlier, in my opinion Kim Chong-il 
will be able to rule North Korea for a certain period on the 
strength of his experience and ability alone. Yet North Korea 
continues to overexaggerate his image, and this might rather 
cause his early fall. 
  That is why we need to analyze and evaluate North Korea's 
appraisal of Kim Chong-il accurately and objectively. If we 
were to accept the North Korean appraisal without ascertaining 
facts, we would be faced with difficulties in dealing with the 
future Kim Chong-il regime. For this reason, I will analyze the 
substance of "Kim Chong- il, the Leader," Vol. I and Vol. II, 
(hereunder referred to as "Leader- 1" and "Leader-2," 
respectively), Tongbangsa, 1984, co-authored by Tak Chin, Kim 
Kang-il, and Pak Hong-che, by way of critiquing the process of 
blowing up Kim Chong-il's image. 
  The most distorted part of Kim Chong-il's biography concerns 
his birthplace. According to "Leader-1," "Dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il was born ... at a secret camp in Mt. Paektu on 16 
February 1942." In fact, Mt. Paektu, known as a sacred mountain 
of our nation, has been the spiritual prop of the Korean race. 
For this reason Kim Il-song has exaggerated the anti-Japanese 
armed struggle in the area around Mt. Paektu (the Changbaek 
Mountains), using it as the basis of his legitimacy. 
Accordingly, North Korea might have had no other choice but to 
fabricate the story of Kim Chong-il's birth in a secret camp in 
that mountain while Kim Il-song was waging the anti-Japanese 
struggle in 1942 (some say 1941). Otherwise the myth about the 
Kim Il- song-led anti-Japanese armed struggle in and around Mt. 
Paektu would crumble, weakening the logical basis of the 
succession doctrine as well. 
  The general view on Kim Chong-il's birthplace is that he was 
born in the South Camp in a village near Vladivostok, Russia. 

<H5>    2. Unstable Character </H5>
  Among Kim Chong-il watchers, there is a controversy over the 
question of his personality. On the whole Kim Chong-il's 
character is far from a composed and stable type. "Leader-2" on 
page 167, says: "He is always pondering some problem. Even when 
he sits, he constantly moves; and when he crosses the room he 
does not walk slowly, but moves with agility." But when we 
interpret this remark--originally intended as a compliment--in a 
critical light, we would say Kim Chong-il is unstable. 
  Kim Chong-il could be a militant. "Leader-2" on page 123 
says: "The piebald horse he wanted was still an untamed 
ferocious wild horse unfit for riding. The workers were 
reluctant, but he insisted on bringing the horse to him." The 
book continues: "Aggressiveness, speed, and incisiveness--this 
temperament clearly manifested itself in accomplishing 
everything at a stroke. Thrust forward quickly, break through 
barriers and dash forth ceaselessly by leaps--this is his 
unique work ethos. This passionate temperament found its 
expression in the Speed Battle." In this way the book pays 
tribute to Kim Chong-il's intrepidity. But conversely, this is 
indicative of being foolhardy and adventurous. 
  The question of modesty arises in discussing Kim Chong-il's 
personality. Says "Leader-1" on page 92: "He is erudite, free 
and easy in disposition, and does not get bogged down in 
anything. Naturally, in response to unanimous requests by 
classmates, he got himself involved in many activities on the 
university campus and stood at the center of the youth 
movement." "Leader-1" on pages 255-256 says: "His fine virtue 
of dealing with others with modesty and frankness always warmed 
people's hearts, inspiring a boundless sense of intimacy, and 
wrapped people around him wrapped in a family atmosphere... 
Wherever he went, he soon mingled with people." "Leader-2" on 
page 378 says: "When he mounts the platform, or leaves the hall 
after a meeting, he always tries to let former anti-Japanese 
fighters precede him. This sometimes causes a temporary halt in 
the flow of dignitaries mounting or leaving the platform." In 
this way the books try to publicize his image as a humble man. 
  Kim Chong-il is even said to be arrogant to people of his 
father's generation because he grew up as the oldest son of Kim 
Il-song, and identifies himself with his father's status. 
Reportedly, he holds his hands behind his back even in front of 
Kim Il-song; and that is why the "followers of Kim Il-song" 
complain about this attitude. Accordingly, the claim that he is 
humble could be fiction. 

<H5>    3. `Daring,' Wide-Angle Politician </H5>
  There are also arguments about Kim Chong-il's ruling style. 
North Korean propaganda claims that Kim Chong-il engaged in 
politics early on as a university student. Says "Leader-1" on 
page 122: "Early on in his university days, Dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il emerged as a politician who contributed directly to 
the formulation and implementation of party policies, not as a 
politician who merely took part in politics to simply help 
implement party policies... Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il was a 
university student and a politician at the same time." The book 
claims that he was a student politician who personally 
contributed to the formulation and implementation of party 
policies during his university days, going beyond simply 
assisting in the implementation of party policies. From all 
this, it may be surmised that he was interested in politics 
already in his youth. 
  Regarding his work style, North Korea is publicizing that he 
is a "daring" wide-angle politician. Says "Leader-1" on page 
277: "It is customary for him to tackle any task daringly and 
boldly. But the latest large, long-distance belt-conveyer 
transport project was a particularly fantastic and grandiose 
transformation plan... In fact, after this project, numerous 
structures were built under a long-range plan under his 
guidance. The large long-distance belt-conveyor transport 
construction project at Unyul Mine marked the beginning of the 
series of impressive monumental structures erected under plans 
for the ages." Of course, that was true because the succeeding 
years saw the erection of numerous gigantic strictures, such as 
Changgwang Street (in 1980), the Great Study Hall of the People 
(in 1981), the Arch of Triumph and the Chuche Tower (in 1982) 
in North Korea. The problem, however, is that Kim Chong-il, who 
entered politics with no political philosophy, thinks anything 
huge is valuable without regard to efficiency and economic 
benefits. This is to say that contrary to North Korea' boast, 
what they call wide-angle politics is a reflection of the 
haphazard, extemporaneous, and uneconomical aspects of his 
personality, and it could cause him difficulties in securing his 
authority as the successor. 

<H5>    4. Kim Chong-il's Ruling Style </H5>
  In addition to all those problems, the side effects of 
personalty cult- centered mode of rule are very serious as 
apparent from this passage on page 136 of "Leader-2": "He 
immediately sent a high-performance pump by helicopter. No 
sooner had he received a report that a certain mine had no 
means to haul dirt than he dispatched large trucks. They were 
able to instantly overcome whatever obstacles and temporary 
slack times by following his bold and resourceful 
countermeasures." In the last analysis, this mode of personal 
rule has become one of the fundamental causes leading to the 
derangement of North Korea's economic structure, a planned 
economy. This is to say that his mode of operation is a factor 
causing the incapacitation of the planned economy. A more 
serious problem is that Kim, failing to realize the 
seriousness of this, is absorbed in "gift-oiled politics" and 
"invitation-driven politics," the acme of personal rule. 
  Another problem involving his ruling style concerns his 
working hours. "Leader-2" on page 166 says: "Dear Comrade Kim 
Chong- il's daily schedule begins at 0000 hours and ends at 0000 
hours on the following day... Some of his aides say his 
schedule flows like a duet or a trio, and others say his 
schedule runs on a two-dimensional or three-dimensional scale." 
This kind of operating style has led to grumbling by 
functionaries. Those concerned have to stand by just in case he 
summons them, and this reduces efficiency due to the difficulty 
in adapting oneself to the different working hours. Therefore, 
this operating style should be viewed as a factor undermining 
his authority rather than an asset. 

<H5>    5. Kim Chong-il's Complex </H5>
  Another question raised by Kim watchers is, why does he 
seldom appear in public? There may be roughly two reasons. 
First, it may be because of his scheming temperament. In this 
connection, "Leader-1" on page 364 explains: "While moved as 
they were by the marvelous changes, the general public in many 
cases knew very little about his hard work hidden in those 
marvels because he worked silently by mixing with the masses. 
Moreover, he tried hard to shun publicity on his achievements. 
That is why in most cases his heroic efforts in certain tasks 
came to light belatedly. This to say that what he accomplished 
was in the limelight, but he hid himself behind his 
accomplishments." Nevertheless, it may not be out of modesty 
but because of his scheming personality and his tendency to 
shun the masses that Kim Chong-il avoids public appearances as 
much as possible. Some critics attribute it to his "inferiority 
complex about being short." 
  Secondly, his poor conversational skills may be another 
reason. Of course, "Leader-2" on page 12 praises his speaking 
capability in these words: "He delivers powerful speeches in 
plain words, but he leads the audience to the high ground of 
his unique thought through his well-organized logic." However, 
none of his speeches has ever been broadcast in his own voice. 
This sheds light on the question of his public speaking 
capability. That he is an illogical and unsystematic orator was 
proven by the testimonies of Choe Un-hui and Sin Sang-ok. In 
this connection, it may be said that Kim Chong-il has a 
"stutterer complex." 

<H5>    6. Childhood Glorified </H5>
  Another problem is that "Leader-1" and "Leader-2" exaggerate 
Kim Chong-il's wizardry. North Korea traces back Kim's 
childhood to age three in order to highlight his love of the 
country. "Leader-1" on page 8 describes his return to Korea as 
follows: "One day shortly after liberation Dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il was en route to Pyongyang on board a boxcar with his 
mother, Mme Kim Chong-suk, and other female anti-Japanese 
fighters. The train traveled along the scenic east coast in the 
liberated homeland before heading west. As he watched a hamlet 
of thatched houses at the foot of the mountain from the 
whistling train, his face beamed with joy. Everything seemed to 
welcome him and his party with an extended hand. Young as he 
was, he felt deep in his heart the preciousness of the 
fatherland." 
  According to this book, he must have been 3 years old when 
he returned to Korea, for he was born in 1942. A 3-year-old 
prodigy could have an exceptional ability to speak and 
comprehend, as well as exceptional mathematical reasoning power. 
But according to experts, even such a whiz kid is not 
emotionally mature enough to express his inner feelings about 
his country. Therefore, the claim that he felt deep in his heart 
the preciousness of the fatherland at that young age is an 
exaggeration of his personality. This is to say that North 
Korea is exaggerating Kim's childhood in an attempt to deify 
him and elevate him to the level of Jesus Christ. 
  "Leader-1" on pages 14-15 tells anecdotes about him as a 
preschooler. An old man was telling the story of a woman named 
Kye Wol-hyang, who during Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea in 
1592, spied on the enemy and passed the secrets to our forces, 
resulting in the death of an enemy general and the recapture of 
Pyongyang. The old man was embarrassed because he could not 
recall the name of the Japanese general. At that moment Kim 
Chong-il, who sat near the old man, gave him the name and left 
quietly. The audience called the young child a whiz kid. That 
is the gist of the story. The book also carries the following 
anecdote about Kim's exceptional wisdom: "From childhood Dear 
Comrade Kim Chong-il surprised those around him by his 
wide-ranging knowledge and high level of intelligence that were 
beyond imagination for his age. First of all, his knowledge and 
intelligence are gifts of nature." "Leader-1" on page 25 says: 
"The intensity of the fire of his effort and enthusiasm can be 
surmised by the single fact that the books he read from 
childhood through secondary school numbered in the thousands." 
  Regarding Kim's academic ability, "Leader-1" on page 91 
says: "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il's writings are really many- 
sided. The forms and methods he uses in writing scientific 
theses are very diverse and the scale of his works is huge 
indeed. The substance covers a wide range of politics, 
economics, education, science, literature, and art." Even if 
these anecdotes are true, they are not particularly unusual. 
Kim Chong-il might have had an extra lesson in Hideyoshi's 
invasion of Korea from his tutor, and thus the young Kim, 
dubiously known as a prodigy, might have been able to recall 
the name of the Japanese general. But no doubt they went too 
far when they turned him into a prodigy. The claim that he is a 
bookworm may be accepted at face value to some extent, but the 
claim that he is an expert in all fields, not just one 
particular field, is hardly acceptable. 

<H5>    7. Kim Chong-il's Doubtful Record </H5>
  Whether Kim Chong-il studied abroad or not is also an open 
question. "Leader-1" on page 57 says: "Quite a few people 
predicted that Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il would study abroad 
when he graduated from a higher middle school. People thought 
so partly because it was a popular notion in those days that 
anyone desiring to be successful in life should go abroad to 
study, and partly because he traveled abroad in his higher 
middle school days before going on to university. His decision 
to study at Kim Il-song University, however, was a 
demonstration of his thoroughgoing chuche awareness to pursue 
studies based on reality in his own country where the great 
chuche ideology and party policy, its embodiment, are in bloom." 
  Generally speaking, quite a few youths belonging to the 
generation that experienced colonial rule in the early 1900's 
went abroad to study, and North Koreans were no exception. As 
the author of "Leader" admits, the general atmosphere in those 
days was such that study abroad was essential for the ruling 
elite. However, suppose that Kim Il-song, who adopted 
self-reliance and chuche as the dominant ideology, had sent Kim 
Chong-il abroad to study for whatever reasons, it might have 
raised a serious question about the "holiness" and "the chuche 
stand and attitude" of the Kim Il-song regime. That is why 
North Korea is stressing that Kim Chong-il did not go abroad to 
study. 
  However, the problem is that there is a 2-year blank in Kim 
Chong-il's schooling. He entered Namsan Higher Middle School in 
Pyongyang in September 1957. But it is not clear where he was 
in from August 1958 when he was enrolled at his higher middle 
school, to September 1960 when he entered Kim Il-song 
University. Some critics say he was studying at the East German 
Air Force Academy. They try to substantiate this speculation by 
the fact that when he writes the Arabic numeral 7, he crosses 
it with a bar, just as Europeans do--a practice not found among 
Orientals. One may refute this by saying that he might have 
taken on that habit while he was playing with the children of 
Russian advisers. 
  On the other hand, there is another somewhat different 
question concerning the North Korean claim that Kim Chong-il 
uncovered the thesis "On Combating Dogmatism and Formalism in 
Ideological Work and Establishing Chuche," known as the 
theoretical foundation of the chuche ideology in North Korea. 
Says "Leader-1" on page 167: "In March 1968 Kim Chong-il 
"spotted the leader's following handwritten manuscripts among 
his notes: `On Combating Dogmatism and Formalism in Ideological 
Work and Establishing Chuche,' a masterpiece dated 28 December 
1955; and `On Communist Indoctrination,' a speech delivered in 
November 1958; in addition to the April 1965 Theses." 
  The claim that he uncovered the manuscript of "On Combating 
Dogmatism..." in 1968 is of very great significance. As is 
widely known, this document, supposedly published by Kim 
Il-song in 1955, is a very important document in the study of 
North Korea's chuche ideology. But the problem is that none of 
the official papers, including NODONG SINMUN, ever published it 
that year. Accordingly, most probably this document was 
fabricated by necessity in 1968. 1968 was when the campaign to 
idolize Kim Il-song reached its peak, and they might have found 
it necessary to fabricate Kim Il-song's image as a "great 
chuche ideologist." To this end, North Korea published numerous 
educational books, including "A Sketch of Comrade Kim Il- song's 
Revolutionary Activity" and "Picture Book on the History of the 
Leader's Revolutionary Activity," in order to publicize Kim 
Il-song's revolutionary thought and the sagacity of his 
leadership. Quite possibly, it may be said that North Korea 
fabricated the document, "On Combating Dogmatism..." as part of 
this propaganda campaign. 
  In conclusion, the overblown image of Kim Chong-il in 
"Leader-1" and "Leader-2" is a natural outcome of the 
personality cult that has become a religion in North Korea. To 
define a proper relationship between Kim Il-song "the God" and 
Kim Chong-il the son of "the God," they have no choice but to 
deify Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, in an attempt to exaggerate Kim 
Chong-il's legitimacy and infallibility, they fabricated the 
myth that he was born on Mt. Paektu, and made false claims 
about his wizardry, benevolence, prowess, and ideological 
quality, etc. It is a fact that this kind of hoodwinking works 
on the North Korean people, who remain in social- political 
infancy. But sooner or later the lies will come to light; and 
when the "icon in the cave" breaks, North Korea will be thrown 
into terrible turmoil.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Acceptance of Foreign Military Aid Is </F>
Consistent With the Constitution"] 
  [Text] The last paragraph of Article 53 in Chapter 4 of 
the the Kingdom of Cambodia's Constitution stipulates that "the 
Kingdom of Cambodia shall preserve the right to accept foreign 
aid in terms of military material, arms, ammunition, training of 
the armed forces, and other aid for its own defense and for the 
maintenance of of public order and security within the country." 
  It is well known that in the past, especially in recent 
weeks, not only has the Khmer Rouge resorted to sabotage 
activities to annihilate law and order and public security 
within the country, it has also further nurtured the notion of 
dismembering Cambodia into two parts and taking control of the 
country once again. This being the case, the appeal for 
military aid to enable Cambodia to circumvent "the great danger 
of the Khmer Rouge" does not contradict the country's 
fundamental law at all. Actually, it suits Cambodia's vital 
interests perfectly. For this reason, actions by donor 
countries do not constitute an intervention in the internal 
affairs of Cambodia as alleged by some countries, especially 
Thailand. In fact, it should be acknowledged that aid for the 
reinforcement of Cambodia's defense is also for the promotion of 
the country's democracy, independence, and sovereignty that the 
international community has strived to bring to existence 
through the May 1993 elections. 
  It is really ironic to say that military aid to Cambodia 
will 
affect the security interest of its neighbors. The tiny and 
badly damaged Cambodia does not have enough force to act as have 
been alleged. 
  Obviously, only aid to the Khmer Rouge and obstruction of 
assistance to Cambodia's legitimate government is tantamount to 
interference in the country's internal affairs.

  [Text] ASEAN views attempts by developed nations to link 
social issues to trade agreements as another form of 
protectionism. This is because of the greater concern of such 
countries with how their workers can cope with competition from 
developing countries. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong made 
the point at the opening of the 10th ASEAN labor ministers 
meeting in Singapore. Gen. Lee said ASEAN must resolutely 
oppose attempts in international forums to increase any 
unreasonable standards and practices. These ignore the 
different stages of development and the different economic, 
political, and cultural context of the developing countries. He 
noted that ASEAN governments had adopted a non-adversarial 
approach to labor relations. Instead of compromising workers' 
rights, it in fact assures workers of more secure jobs and 
higher standards of living. As ASEAN's economies develop, this 
approach will have to revolve to meet change and needs, but the 
pace and direction of that revolution must be decided by the 
ASEAN countries themselves.

  [Text] South Sulawesi, a province of Indonesia, recently 
signed a memorandum of understanding for the East ASEAN growth 
polygon (EAGP). 
  The EAGP is an economic cooperation of 12 focus areas in the 
East ASEAN region. Its main aim is to promote trade and 
investment in the region through mutual and beneficial endeavors 
that include shipping, transportation and communications, 
agriculture, fisheries, agro-forestry, industries, and tourism. 
  With a total land area of six million hectares, primarily 
composed of agricultural and forest lands, South Sulawesi 
occupies about 42 percent of the Sulawesi Island. Its main 
source of livelihood is agriculture, fishery, and agro-forestry. 
  An annual economic growth rate of 5.6 percent has made South 
Sulawesi one of the most attractive investment areas in the East 
ASEAN region. A high rate of productivity has made the province 
a leading exporter of rice. In 1991, it recorded 1.4 million 
tons of rice surplus. 
  However, the agriculture sector lacks the facilities for 
agri-processing that can transform harvests into high-value 
goods. But the high potential remains in the non-traditional 
crops like coffee, cocoa, cashew nut, candle nut, crude palm 
oil, and others. 
  The fishery sector also poses a high potential area for 
investment particularly in prawn production, frozen shrimp, and 
cuttle fish. Again, processing of these products is needed to 
further boost the fishery industry. 
  Livestock production shows great potential particularly 
cattle, goat, sheep, hog and poultry raising, both for domestic 
and export consumption. 
  Export of forest products has likewise a big potential 
because of the abundance of forest resources in this Indonesian 
province, covering about 3.6 million hectares.

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Economic growth 
in the Asia-Pacific region is a challenge but is in the same 
time also an opportunity for ASEAN which conduct an open 
economic system, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Industry 
and Trade Hartarto said here on Wednesday. 
  "To face the challenge, ASEAN's economy should be turned 
into 
a more efficient one. Apart from that the quality of their 
products as well as management should be improved to achieve 
world standards," he said at an international conference, 
entitled "Waves of The Future -- ASEAN, Vietnam, and China: 
Opportunities for World Business." 
  At the conference which lasts from May 17 through 19, the 
Indonesian coordinating minister further said that a number of 
opportunities would be wide open for ASEAN investors to conduct 
business in rapid developing countries in the field of industry, 
including China, India, and Vietnam. 
  "These countries are potential markets for our exports," he 
added. 
  According to Hartarto, those countries provide comparative 
advantages in industry which is labour-intensive with relatively 
low labour wages and a hard working labour force. 
  ASEAN should make the necessary adjustment if it wants to be 
successful in an increasingly stiff competition. 
  Hartarto also touched on the success of the Uruguay Round 
and 
the acceptance of GATT and its connection with ASEAN. He 
further believed that the success of the Uruguay Round would 
contribute to ASEAN's economic growth and after the ratification 
of the GATT, the Association of Southeast Asian nations would 
have access into the international market without any obstacles. 
  In his working paper entitled "ASEAN: New Opportunities and 
Challenges," the coordinating minister reiterated the ASEAN 
position and that of the developing countries which rejected the 
interconnection of trade with social and labour standard issues, 
urging that these issues be tackled by existing international 
organizations. 
  The ASEAN labour ministers, who convened here from May 16 
through 17, urged the International Labour Organization (ILO) to 
oppose the Western countries pressure to protect their domestic 
markets. 
  The Western countries should not be permitted to force the 
ILO to apply stiff labour standards as a precondition for the 
developing countries to obain market access, said a joint 
communique of the ASEAN ministers. 
  After seven years of negotiations on the GATT, the 125 
participating countries agreed to implement the GATT at the last 
meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco on April 15. 
  The centre of attention of the GATT is world economic growth 
based on free trade and multilateral system or on an open and 
transparent system. 
  The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade 
body, will replace the GATT and is expected to have more power 
to eradicate global protectionism. 
  Meanwhile, social clauses interlinked with international 
trade agreements are considered as a new form of protectionism. 
Hartarto stated that the European Union and the NAFTA should 
remain open and transparent as was the case with the ASEAN 
economy which adhered to the open system, so that in the future 
Europe, North America, and Asia would achieve a favourable 
economic balance without one region considering itself dominant. 
  Hartarto went on to state that when competition became 
increasingly stiff, increasing productivity in the three regiona 
would become a driving force for world economic growth and 
expansion of world trade which in turn would also create new 
opportinuities for all countries. The coordinating minister for 
industry and trade also revealed that the ASEAN Free Trade Area 
(AFTA) was established to face global challenges. The aim of 
the AFTA is to enhance economic cooperation among the ASEAN 
member countries through the application of the Common Effective 
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) which will be in force as of January 
1993, Hartarto said.

  [Text] SINGAPORE, May 19 (AFP) -- It would not be in the 
United States' interest to deny China its most favoured nation 
(MFN) status, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here Thursday. 
  Responding to questions at a business conference, Li said: 
"MFN is mutually beneficial and the basis for our bilateral 
trading relationship. The granting of MFN status and 
preservation of MFN treatment is of fundamental interest to our 
two countries." 
  Li's comments came as reports from Washington suggested US 
President Bill Clinton was considering partial withdrawal of 
China's trading privileges. He must decide on his course of 
action by June 3. Clinton said last year that he would not 
renew China's MFN status unless Beijing made "significant 
overall progress" on human rights. Beijing has warned that it 
would retaliate against a withdrawal of MFN, and Chinese Premier 
Li Peng said earlier this week that China would not tolerate 
interference in its internal affairs. 
  Li Lanqing said he had not heard of proposals for limited 
penalities on Chinese exports as an alternative to total 
withdrawal of China's MFN status but commented that the 
privilege was "mutually beneficial" and important for bilateral 
trade. 
  The three-day conference, organised by the New York-based 
Asia Society, has attracted 800 business and political leaders, 
mostly from Asia-Pacific. 
  Washington's decision to link China's MFN status to human 
rights has been criticised by some Asian governments, worried 
that a withdrawal would cause regional economic and political 
harm. 
  Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong Tuesday warned that 
any move to cut off Asia's booming economies from western 
markets could trigger the formation of an Asian trade bloc. 
  "An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a 
viable option," Goh told the same conference Tuesday. 
  Li said China would continue to modernise its economy, tap 
opportunities abroad and provide conditions for foreign 
investors to prosper. 
  "China's development cannot do without the world and the 
world's development needs China's participation," he said.

  [Text] SINGAPORE, May 19 (AFP) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing indicated Thursday that Beijing had no intention of 
reversing its decision to give a US oil company rights to 
explore for oil in territory disputed with Vietnam. Li said 
that while Beijing would continue "friendly consultations" with 
Hanoi on overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, 
these talks would cover only disputed territories, not territory 
belonging to China. 
  "In regards to indisputable territories, there is no 
question," he told a business opportunities conference here 
organised by the New York-based Asia Society. Li was asked 
whether China would keep a pledge to its Southeast Asian 
neighbours to keep the peace over territorial disputes in the 
Spratly islands. The islands, which reputedly sit atop vast 
deposits of oil and gas, are claimed in whole or part by Brunei, 
China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  Crestone, a Colorado-based oil company, announced last month 
that it planned to drill into the Tu Chinh sandbar, about 400 
kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Vietnam's coast, under terms 
of a concession signed with China. But Vietnam, which claims 
that the Tu Chinh sandbar is well within its special economic 
zone and continental shelf, has demanded Crestone halt all 
operations in the area, saying any exploration was illegal. 
  Li welcomed remarks by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
at the same conference Wednesday that Hanoi would pursue its 
claims in the South China Sea "through peaceful negotiations and 
in an atmosphere of friendship." He said that Beijing still 
believed that claimants should jointly develop disputed areas. 
  Kiet told the STRAITS TIMES daily in an interview published 
Thursday that while Hanoi would defend its territory, it saw no 
reason to use force in Tu Chinh because of improvements in ties 
with China. The Chinese and Vietnamese navies fought a brief 
but bloody engagement in the Spratlys in March 1988. Hundreds 
of Vietnamese were believed to have been killed in the fighting.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Russian Ambassador to 
South Korea Georgiy Kunadze said Wednesday that North Korea, as 
a member of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), should 
fulfill all of its obligations under the treaty. 
  He told a symposium in Tokyo titled "Peace and Stability in 
East Asia" that, even though North Korea has been insisting that 
it be given a special position ever since it announced its 
intention to withdraw from the NPT, there are no other positions 
in the international convention than that of either a member or 
a non-member. His remarks were seen as tantamount to urging 
Pyongyang to accept full-fledged inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "As a main member of the NPT, Russia will make the maximum 
effort in trying to see to it that nuclear weapons do not appear 
in Northeast Asia," he said. But Kunadze struck a cautious note 
on the issue of sanctions against North Korea, saying that 
isolating the communist state might produce unwanted results. 
  Meanwhile, former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama 
pointed out that international countermeasures against North 
Korea, assuming that it persists in rejecting nuclear 
inspections, depend on the stances of Russia and China. Japan's 
diplomatic ability, he added, will be tested as a result because 
Tokyo may have to control remittances from pro-Pyongyang Koreans 
in Japan to North Korea. 
  Professor Izmi Hazime addressed factors which could trigger 
a 
crisis should the nuclear standoff continue to drag on. He said 
the major factors are whether North Korea could endure extreme 
economic difficulties and whether the United States could 
tolerate the situation. He captured attention by saying that 
the world needs to prepare to use military power under the 
worst-case scenario. 
  An Pyong-chun, a professor at South Korea's Yonsei 
University, said that in order to settle the nuclear problem 
North Korea should remain in the NPT, accept special inspections 
and agree to mutual checks with South Korea. 
  "Although not desirable," he added, "we can think of 
economic 
sanctions by the U.N. Security Council on North Korea. If the 
sanctions are imposed, Japan's exertion of its economic 
influence including suspension of remittances to North Korea is 
essential."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Socialist, social democratic 
and labor parties from all over the world meeting at a congress 
in Tokyo advocated Wednesday [11 May] that Japan and Germany 
become permanent members of an enlarged U.N. Security Council. 
  "The Socialist International supports an increase in the 
number of permanent members to include Germany and Japan as well 
as a number of regional representatives, whilst ensuring that 
the developing world is properly represented," representatives 
from 63 parties and organizations said in a resolution. 
  The Socialist International (SI) currently comprises 111 
political parties and organizations worldwide. 
  Summing up the two-day congress at a news conference the SI 
president, former French Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, noted 
that the Tokyo meeting aimed at listening to the concerns of 
Asian countries and at strengthening the socialist movement 
globally. 
  Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and representatives 
from Bangladesh, Myanmar [Burma], Cambodia, Laos and India were 
among the special guests at the congress which focused on 
democracy and social development in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Mauroy said the SI, given the rapid economic development in 
the Asia-Pacific, must expand relations with free labor unions 
to counter the excesses of "wild capitalism" and protect Asian 
workers from the "great misery" that Europe experienced during 
the industrialization in the 19th century. 
  Speaking at the same news conference, the former head of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) of Japan, Makoto Tanabe, who is SI 
vice president, pointed to the congress resolution on Asia, 
which singles out North Korea as a security risk for its 
suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  "North Korea, which is defying the demand of the U.N. that 
it 
implement comprehensive safeguards measures, can never gain the 
support of the international community," the resolution said. 
  The SDP has long maintained friendly relations with North 
Korea. However, Tanabe said, "on these issues we express, of 
course, our agreement to this resolution." 
  Tanabe called on Pyongyang to allow inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and on other countries 
to intensify efforts to dissuade North Korea from developing 
nuclear weapons.

  [Text] At 1100 on 29 April, Sukhum Ratsamithat, director 
general of the Foreign Ministry's Economic Affairs Department, 
presided over the signing of an agreement at the Foreign 
Ministry under which China joined the Association of Tin 
Producing Countries. Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Jin Guihua 
signed the agreement establishing the Association of Tin 
Producing Countries on behalf of the Chinese Government. Also 
present at the signing ceremony were Indonesian and Malaysian 
representatives and officials from the Mineral Resources 
Department and the Foreign Ministry. 
  The signing ceremony took place in Thailand because the Thai 
Foreign Ministry is the depository of the agreement. The 
Association's membership increases from seven to eight with 
China's accession. The other seven members of the Association 
are Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Zaire, and 
Thailand. All of these countries have joined the Association 
since 1983. 
  The Foreign Ministry pointed out that it is good that China 
has joined the Association. Previously, China was only an 
observer of the Association even though it is the largest tin 
producer. China's membership will strengthen the Association's 
position and bargaining power in talks with tin consuming 
countries to solve problems with tin oversupply and falling tin 
prices jointly. 
  The establishment of the Association of Tin Producing 
Countries was aimed at ensuring fair tin prices and supplies and 
enhancing cooperation in tin marketing and tin resources 
research and development. 
  The Association also agreed upon three conditions for China 
to join the Association: 
  1. China will report its tin exports to the Association 
every quarter. 
  2. China will pay a membership fee in proportion to its 
tin exports. 
  3. China will temporarily not be invited to join the 
International Tin Research Association.

<F P=106> ["Talk" by Singha Sai: "Remove the Thorn To Improve Lao-Thai </F>
Relations"] 
  [Excerpts] When it is said that Lao-Thai relations in the 
recent past have been very peaceful, no one will deny it. 
[passage omitted] 
  Speaking of cooperation in public security along the 
Lao-Thai 
border, from the time of first meeting of the committee for 
cooperation to maintain peace along the Lao-Thai border until 
the third meeting now, it is clear that Lao-Thai relations have 
steadily developed. For example the cooperation to maintain 
peace along the border has been steadily improved so that the 
situation there has gradually become peaceful. Brigadier General 
Douangchai Phichit, secretary-general of the committee for 
cooperation to maintain peace along the border, told our group 
of reporters that "the people living along the Lao-Thai border 
feel more secure than in the past in making a living and 
traveling to and from the neighboring country." The cooperation 
in each locality involved the many border provinces of the two 
countries meeting officially and signing memoranda with each 
other as well as consulting to find ways to correct various 
problems which groups of bad people had caused to disrupt the 
peace in their localities on the border. The cooperation was 
undertaken to make the border areas in the provinces on both 
sides peaceful. 
  In addition the cooperation between the armies of Laos and 
Thailand has involved talks and visits which have brought 
greater understanding. The top Thai officers including those 
from the Ministry of Defense, the Supreme Command Headquarters 
and RTA headquarters have approved of continuing to correct past 
weaknesses and obstacles to ralations, especially those hostile 
groups that want to cause confusion and to disrupt the peace in 
order to block the expansion of Lao-Thai relations. Because of 
the determination of the Thai officials above, it is felt that 
in the future Thai officials will do everything in their power 
against the bad groups which hope to disrupt Lao-Thai relations 
in order that Lao-Thai relations steadily improve and the 
Lao-Thai border is peaceful and stable. 
  On 23 February 1994 officials of the Thai Supreme Command 
Headquarters had Lt.Gen. Phiradet Miphian, the head of the 
Directorate of Joint Intelligence of the Supreme Command 
Headquarters, provide information to the Director of the 
National Police Department so that he could proceed with the 
case against Vang Pao, Thonglit Chokbengboun and their 
associates under the charge of violating Thai security -- their 
base used Thai territory to conduct operations against the Lao 
government. It was used for concealing weapons, and it caused 
losses for the Thai people along the border. In addition this 
affected relations and created doubts between Laos and Thailand. 
In any case many Thai publications printed stories about this, 
and they all felt that Thai officials would act as quickly as 
possible because in a few days the ceremony officially opening 
the Friendship Bridge was to be held, and the day of this 
historic ceremony required peace on the Lao-Thai border. 
  The Thai English-language newspaper DIMENSION wrote that: 
"Vang Pao and Thonglit have a close relationship with the CIA." 
The commander for suppression said that wrongdoers, especially 
Vang Pao and his right-hand man, Thonglit, would have to be 
arrested if they returned to Thailand. If they were in another 
country, officials would observe to see if they were able to 
make their group obey the law. A month has passed, and there has 
been no new information. For real peace on the Lao-Thai border, 
Thai officials will have to move fast to make their deeds match 
their words.

<F P=106> [Report by Dokpek Meuangphouan: "Public Security Activities </F>
in Feuang District"] 
  [Excerpts] Feuang District of Vientiane Province lies in 
the distant mountains. [passage omitted] 
  Relying on the special characteristics of the district, a 
number of bad groups have in the past spread propaganda 
slandering the policies and plans of our party and have seduced 
and deceived some ignorant members of ethnic minorities into 
being their lackeys, whom they used to create disorder in the 
localities and cause difficulties for the people in making a 
living. Since 1993, in order to bring the peace and stability of 
a base area to the entire district, the party committee and 
administrative committee of the district as well as its military 
headquarters and public security service have worked together 
closely both in planning and actual operations. [passage omitted] 
  Then they mobilized the able-bodied LPRYU members to 
volunteer to serve the nation. They mobilized the multi-ethnic 
people and various mass organizations such as the LPRYU, the 
women's organization, trade unions, and the united fronts in 
each village to put their material possessions at the disposal 
of the cadres and combatants who were maintaining the peace in 
the localities at various points. The guerrilla forces, 
self-defense forces, police and district soldiers, in addition 
to coordinating closely in inspecting and defending the peace in 
their localities, also improved their political and military 
skills. [passage omitted] In particular they set up a security 
service for each village to be on duty 24 hours a day which 
inspected the papers of people entering and leaving and 
inspected for gamblers and other dangers to society. When 
something bad happened, they quickly coordinated their 
activities and reported in a timely fashion. 
  Because the party committee, administrative committee, and 
the district military headquaters always recognized the 
importance of public security activities and because the 
multi-ethnic people throughout the district were very patriotic 
and had a tradition of brave struggle and unwillingness to 
submit to the enemy, the unrest in the district has now been 
overcome, and we can now say that the entire district has the 
peace and stability of a base area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta, May 19 (AFP) -- Indonesia threatened 
Thursday to scrap a meeting between Filipino Muslim rebels and 
Manila representatives in Jakarta if the Philippines failed to 
block a planned conference on East Timor. 
  "It will be definitely postponed if, between now and June, 
this disappointment (about the East Timor conference) is not 
addressed in a proper way," foreign ministry spokesman Irawan 
Abidin told AFP. 
  He was referring to a meeting arranged by Indonesia between 
the Philippine government and a Muslim separatist group, the 
Moro National Liberation Front, scheduled to be held in mid-June. 
  Jakarta is angry about a private seminar on human rights 
[words indistinct] Timor, the former Portuguese colony annexed 
by Indonesia in 1976. The seminar is due to be held in Manila 
from May 31 to June 3.

  [Text] Deputies of the House of Representatives [HR] 
believe that the government should not be provoked into reacting 
emotionally to a conference on East Timor scheduled to be held 
in the Philippines and there is no need for the government to 
bar non-governmental organizations [NGOs] from attending the 
conference. Abu Hassan Sazili, chairman of House Commission I 
in charge of foreign affairs, defense, security, and 
information, advised the government not to force the Philippine 
Government to cancel the conference because the political system 
of the Philippines differs from Indonesia's. In this regard, he 
urged the Indonesian Government to provide the international 
community with information about developments in East Timor. 
Such a step would be better than an emotional reaction to the 
conference. 
  Meanwhile, Theo Sambuaga, leader of the Functional Group in 
the House of Representatives, hoped that Indonesian NGOs invited 
to the conference would tell others about the true situation in 
East Timor instead of discrediting the government.

  [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--President Suharto 
stressed that no country has the right to dictate to other 
countries its own concepts or views on basic human rights, let 
alone force those concepts or views as conditions for 
international economic cooperation. 
  In his speech at an official dinner in the honor of Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers on Tuesday, 5 April, President 
Suharto again stressed the united position of Indonesia, 
Nonaligned Movement countries, and other developing countries. 
  "I stressed that basic human rights and liberties, as 
embodied and spelled out in the charter and various other 
declarations and documents of the United Nations, do indeed 
include things that are universal in nature. Basic human rights 
should be protected and promoted by all nations. This needs to 
be done through international cooperation on the basis of 
equality," the president emphasized. 
  Attention needs to be given to the very close connection 
between basic human rights and other rights, such as civil, 
political, economic, social, and cultural rights, the president 
continued. 
  The balance between individual rights and the rights of 
society and the nation also needs to be guarded. 
  The United Nations itself, the president said, acknowledges 
that the authority and responsibility for implementing those 
rights nationally lies with each government and fully notes the 
differences among countries with regard to culture, religion, 
customs, and levels of economic growth. 
<H5>  No Signs </H5>
  Earlier, the president said that there are as yet no signs 
that the international economic disparity can be resolved. 
Growing economic globalization has drastically changed 
production, trade, and monetary patterns and has had the impact 
of producing large economic groupings among industrialized 
countries in ways that tend toward protectionism, 
discrimination, and a climate of unhealthy competition. 
  "In this situation, Indonesia is convinced of the need to 
bridge the economic disparity between the North and the South 
through international cooperation, consultation, and 
consultative dialogue," the president said. 
  The president also said that he has never seen the fortunes 
and interests of the North and the South as closely connected as 
they are now. 
  Therefore, the president said, it is natural and logical for 
both sides to expand cooperation on the basis of true mutual 
dependence, mutual interests, and mutual benefit. 
  The president said that countries now face uncertainty in 
various aspects of life. The end of the cold war and East-West 
enmity has opened opportunities for building a new era for 
international relations. 
  Growing mutual dependence and economic globalization have 
provided hopeful opportunities. Nevertheless, the hopeful world 
situation is not without obstacles and challenges. 
  "Several new problems and dilemmas have emerged on the 
political and economic scene. In some areas, there have arisen 
new tensions and conflicts, aggression and foreign interference, 
conflicts rooted in ethnic and religious controversies, new 
forms of racism, and the resurrection of narrow nationalism," 
the chief of state said. 
  In a world situation full of uncertainty, Indonesia and 
other 
developing countries are conducting their respective national 
development in order to catch up. 
  "We fully realize that the responsibility for the 
development 
of a nation is entirely on the shoulders of that nation itself. 
On the other hand, we also realize that success will remain 
difficult to achieve if international and regional spheres are 
not supportive. That is the reason why the Indonesian people 
always take part in encouraging the creation of a world economic 
order based on partnership, equality, and fairness," the 
president said. 
  The president said that, remembering their very long ties of 
history, relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands have 
significance for both countries. Nevertheless, the president 
said, we can now give new meaning and objectives to the ties of 
the past. 
  "We establish these ties as countries on the same level who 
respect each other, avoid interfering in each other's internal 
affairs, and provide benefit to each other," the president 
stated. 
<H5>  Opportunities </H5>
  In their talk on Tuesday afternoon, President Suharto told 
Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers that there are opportunities 
for Dutch businessmen to take part in developing various aspects 
of the economic infrastructure, such as the construction of 
electric power plants, telecommunications facilities, and a 
container port under the BOT (build, operate, transfer) system. 
  "President Suharto also opened opportunities for Dutch 
businessmen to invest their capital here. Their products can be 
marketed not only in the European Community, but in the Asia 
Pacific area, too," Murdiono said as he described to reporters 
the results of the talks between President Suharto and Prime 
Minister Lubbers at Freedom Palace on Tuesday, 5 April. 
  According to Murdiono, the opportunity to develop the 
various 
aspects of the economic infrastructure was offered to Dutch 
businessmen because of the state's limited financial ability to 
develop that infrastructure. 
  In response to the president's offer, Prime Minister Lubbers 
said the Netherlands is ready to expand cooperation in the 
economic sector because Dutch businessmen have considerable 
investment capability. 
<H5>  Naval Cooperation </H5>
  According to Murdiono, Prime Minister Lubbers specifically 
offered cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia in the 
naval sector for acquisition of ships, use of Dutch technology 
(which is considered to be quite high), and, possibly, joint 
exercises. 
  The minister of state and state secretary [MENSESNEG] said 
the president responded that those matters can be discussed at 
the senior official level. 
  Nevertheless, Murdiono said, the president also stressed 
that 
the Indonesian people are determined to give priority to 
economic development. 
  "This does not mean that Indonesia has accepted the proposal 
from the Dutch Government," he added. 
  Murdiono explained that defense and security development 
does 
in fact have priority, although the priority is not as high as 
that of economic development. "Therefore, we must see first what 
it is they are offering and what we need, and before they offer 
we must see whether we are able to pay for it," the MENSESNEG 
said. 
  The president also took the opportunity to explain the 
thinking behind strategic development in both PJP [Long-Term 
Development] I and PJP II, in addition to explaining matters 
related to the Nonaligned Movement and APEC [Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation]. On his part, Prime Minister Lubbers 
explained various developments in Europe. 
  The president also urged the Netherlands to participate in 
cooperation within the three-way South-South concept. The 
problem, said Murdiono, is that South-South cooperation is often 
difficult to carry out because the funds of Southern countries 
are limited. In this situation, it is hoped that a third party, 
in this case industrialized countries, will participate.

  [Text] Belawan, N. Sumatra, May 18 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The 
Malacca and Philip straits with a high density of international 
sea traffic, were now free from "traditional" piracy, a 
high-ranking Indonesian naval officer said. 
  "There have been no pirates attacking tankers in the Malacca 
Strait since 1992," commander of the Western Armada Rear Admiral 
Arief Kushariadi told the press in Belawan Tuesday. 
  Taking part in a "sea security safari," the two-star admiral 
said the success of the navy in maintaining security in the 
Malacca Strait was thanks to integrated sea patrol operations 
with the support of the sea patrols of Malaysia and Singapore. 
  He said in most cases the local pirates in their actions 
normally used sharp and pointed weapons such as machetes and 
sickles, not firearms. 
  When asked on the hardware and facilities owned by the 
Indonesian Navy in support of security operations in Indonesian 
territorial waters which formed two thirds of Indonesia's total 
national territory, he said they were quite adequate. 
  "However, ideally, we should have 400 warships to maintain 
security in our vast territorial waters, but those we already 
have are actually sufficient to do the job," he said.

  [Text] H. Harmoko, general chairman of the Functional Group 
(GOLKAR) DPP [Central Executive Council], declared that GOLKAR 
has a strategic plan for victory in the 1997 general election 
and for success in the 1998 General Session of the MPR [People's 
Consultative Assembly]. 
  "As of today, all GOLKAR echelons have a strategic plan for 
victory in the 1997 general election and for success in the 1998 
General Session of the MPR, and the plan subsequently will be 
the principle and guideline for achieving objectives," Harmoko 
declared Wednesday, 30 March, as he closed the GOLKAR DPP 
national working conference. 
  Harmoko explained that people at all echelons of GOLKAR 
fully 
understand the importance of the strategic plan, because it has 
a legal basis, targets, challenges, opportunities, and strategic 
points, although it contains only general points on steps that 
must be taken. 
<H5>  Election Targets </H5>
  The subject of GOLKAR preparations for the 1997 general 
election took up almost all of the press conference held after 
the national working conference adjourned. 
  In reply to a reporter's question about GOLKAR targets in 
the 
next election, Harmoko said GOLKAR will try to get as many votes 
as possible through honorable means. 
  GOLKAR will fight to win the most votes, Harmoko continued, 
because GOLKAR's guiding principle is the upholding of the state 
of the Republic of Indonesia, which is based on Pancasila 
[ideology of the Indonesian state] and the 1945 Constitution, on 
dynamic national stability, and on a national leadership firmly 
held by the New Order. 
  "GOLKAR cadres have carefully integrated their operations, 
positions, and actions for the sake of achieving a threefold 
success, namely consolidation, REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year 
Development Plan], and the 1997 general election," Harmoko 
declared. 
  When asked whether internal and external problems will 
affect 
the winning of votes, Harmoko responded quickly that any 
organization, especially a sociopolitical organization, is sure 
to have problems. Nevertheless, Harmoko declared, GOLKAR is 
confident that through the programs and positions of GOLKAR 
cadres such problems can be resolved and will not affect the 
winning of votes. "GOLKAR is optimistic," he added. 
  With regard to the honorable methods GOLKAR wants to use to 
win an election victory and with respect to the negative 
comments that have been made about GOLKAR victories, Harmoko 
said that general elections are conducted on the basis of the 
General Election Law. 
  "GOLKAR has never deviated from the provisions of the 
General 
Election Law, and GOLKAR has never acted unfairly. It is very 
wrong for anyone to say that GOLKAR wins through dishonorable 
means," Harmoko declared. 
  Harmoko also said that the other election participant 
organizations, namely the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] and 
the PPP [Development Unity Party], are not opponents but are 
GOLKAR's partners in developing political life. 
<H5>  Statement of GOLKAR Position </H5>
  An election target is one of the eleven points in GOLKAR's 
position statement. The fourth point of the position statement 
says that the winning of the most votes in the five general 
elections is an expression of public confidence. 
  This has put GOLKAR in the position of sole majority in 
legislative institutions and has developed and strengthened the 
political structure and culture on the basis of Pancasila and 
the 1945 Constitution. 
  Other points are GOLKAR's consistent position, the dual 
function of ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces], succession, and 
maintenance of discipline. Harmoko said that issuance of this 
GOLKAR position statement is a new policy and will be made a 
tradition for each national working conference. 
<H5>  Member Discipline </H5>
  With regard to the issue of discipline among GOLKAR cadres, 
which has recently surfaced through the quarrel over selecting 
regents/chiefs of second-level regions in several regions, 
Harmoko said GOLKAR will maintain organizational discipline on 
the basis of existing legal provisions, including the taking of 
firm action against cadres who deviate from guidelines laid down 
by GOLKAR. 
  "The concept of organizational discipline will be a GOLKAR 
priority in the future, because without discipline an 
organization will not function but will disintegrate instead," 
Harmoko declared. He added that GOLKAR will act both to persuade 
and to educate, except that firm action will be taken toward 
recalcitrant cadres. 
  In reply to a question about cases of bad debts and several 
social and legal problems involving some GOLKAR cadres and 
executives, Harmoko said that GOLKAR will give "equal treatment" 
to cadres in both "superstructure" and "infrastructure." 
  "Thus, the maintenance of 'clean and strong government' is a 
part of upholding law and justice. Therefore, legal action must 
be taken against any cadre who acts in an aberrant way," Harmoko 
stated. 
  As for the matter of discipline problems among members of 
FKP's [Development Function factions] in first-and second-level 
DPRD's [regional legislatures], which produced quarrels over the 
selection of regents, Harmoko explained that FKP members are 
extensions of GOLKAR and must follow the policies laid down by 
the GOLKAR DPP. "Those problems were discussed thoroughly in 
this national working conference," he said. 
  Harmoko explained that after the quarrels over selection of 
regents were examined, it turned out that the quarrels were 
cases of political "engineering" by people with personal 
interests. "After going into the field, the DPP knows precisely 
that personal interests were present," Harmoko added.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Conditionality of Aid"] </F>
  [Text] The worldwide tendency to link foreign aid with 
human rights protection has been escalating in spite of the 
strong opposition to such strings from the governments of the 
developing countries which make up the majority of aid 
beneficiaries. 
  The latest stage in the human rights campaign was initiated 
by the donor members of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at its 
annual meeting in Nice, France last week. The creditor members 
led by the United States government, stipulated what they term 
"good governance" as one of the 11 conditions for the approval 
of the 1OO percent increase in ADB's capital to US$48 billion. 
  Similar debates between thc governments of developing 
countries and industrialized countries occurred between March 
and April, when the U.S. government, with the support of several 
other advanced countries, strongly demanded that international 
trade be linked with the protection of labor rights. The 
demand, which threatened to foil the signing of the new global 
trade pact in Morocco in the middle of lasl month, was rejected 
and the agreements resulting from the 7.5-year-long Uruguay 
Round of trade negotiations were finally signed by almost all 
members of GATT. 
  That human rights have not yet been explicitly stipulated as 
a condition to international aid does not mean that the 
international campaign for such linkage will die down. Instead, 
developing country governments should gear up for a time when 
such a condition will be imposed officially. 
  We have observed that the international campaign for human 
rights protection has been going on for many years under various 
guises such as workers rights, aid for social welfare and 
democratization. In fact, good governance could also be seen as 
part of the overall program to respect human rights. That can 
be inferred, for example, from the prerequisites which the 
international community has set for what is termed as good 
governance: Respect for human rights, democratic rule, fair, 
efficient and transparent public management, public 
accountability and clean government. 
  There are at least two main reasons for the campaign. One is 
the perception among the international community, notable among 
the advanced country governments, that the violation of human 
rights is one of the major threats to international stability 
and peace in the current post-Cold War era. As recent 
experiences have shown, human rights violations have caused 
people to flee their homelands in huge numbers and the poor 
situation of workers has led to the problem of illegal 
immigrants with all the negative implications. 
  The second reason is the fact that economic globalization 
and 
communications technology are turning the world into a globa] 
village. Hence, the government of a country, whether it is a 
developing or developed one, tends to be assessed by an 
internationally accepted set of yardsticks. Since aid to the 
developing countries is funded mostly by the taxpayers in the 
advanced nations, the developed country governments are under 
increasing pressures from their legislatures, the 
representatives of the taxpayers, to attach human rights 
protection as a condition to their overseas aid. 
  Whether we like or not, we will have to live with the 
reality 
that human rights protection in its broadest terms will 
eventually be stipulated as a condition not only to official aid 
but also to loans from such multilateral aid or lending agencies 
as ADB, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, 
because their lending resources are also financed mostly by the 
taxpayers in the advanced countries. 
  Although developing country governments may have legitimate 
points in their arguments against such a condition, the essence 
of the campaign for human rights is actually for the good of all 
mankind in both developing and developed nations. And human 
rights are also imperative for a sustainable development 
process. What is relative with regard to the implementation of 
the condition is perhaps the stages of the fulfillment of human 
rights protection in its broadest sense. The implementation may 
have to be adjusted to the stages of economic development in the 
various countries.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia cannot hope to achieve 
harmonious industrial relations unless it is willing to give its 
workers more political power, a top union official says. 
  Bomer Pasaribu, the secretary-general of the All-Indonesia 
Workers Union (SPSI), called for labor reforms that ensure 
workers enough power to put them at a par with management. 
  The present labor system was developed with the purpose of 
keeping worker wages low, a factor seen as a prerequisite to 
attracting foreign investors, Bomer told a seminar on industrial 
relations yesterday. 
  He implied that union power had been purposefully weakened 
to 
achieve that goal. 
  He proposed a new system that ensures industrial democracy 
and in turn harmonious industrial relations. 
  "Democratization of the industrial sector should be 
encouraged to put workers in an equal position at the 
negotiating table with employers or capital owners" Bomer said. 
  He cited the lack of democracy as the prime cause of much of 
the labor unrest in Indonesia in recent years, including the 
workers' protest that turned riotous in Medan, North Sumatera, 
last month 
  But while arguing for a system that guarantees workers 
freedom to organize, Bomer insisted that workers should unite in 
one union, the SPSI, to ensure its effectiveness and strength. 
  "To strengthen the workers position, they should be unified 
in a single organization, SPSI," he said. 
  He emphasized that the single union concept was a comnitment 
made by 23 separate labor organizations which merged into one 
federation in 1973. 
  He claimed that almost all countries in the world have only 
one labor union. 
  SPSI's existence has been widely questioned by many of its 
members in recent years, with many expressing disappointment at 
its failure in defending their interests. 
  The creation of the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Unior (SBSI) 
two years ago was intended to address these concerns but the 
government has refused to recognize it as a legal entity. 
  SBSI has been blamed for organizing the workers' protests 
which disintegrated into rioting in Medan last month. 
  Bomer proposed that as part of the labor reforms workers 
should be given training in effective bargaining strategies to 
enable them to better deal with managements. 
  He said that while the first 25-year development program in 
Indonesia produced many large business conglomerations, the 
conditions of Indonesian workers have worsened. "It is an irony 
that the labor situation is worsening amid the success of 
economic development," he said. 
  Efforts to form unions are appallingly weak, with almost 70 
percent of the 147,000 registered manufacturing companies in 
Indonesia still without SPSI representatives. 
  Bomer also acknowledged that collusion between managements 
and elected workers' representatives was rife, calling this 
another detrimental factor to the progress of workers.

liberalizing the entry of foreign banks into the country. In 
his speech during the signing, the president said the new law 
will trigger more efficient operation for local banks as well as 
facilitate new business and investments. Republic Act 7721 was 
also lauded by members of the banking community. Rafael 
Buenavantura, president of the Bankers' Association of the

  [Text] Manila, May 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea proposed 
Monday to form a "special partnership" with the Philippines 
accenting economic cooperation. Philippine President Fidel 
Ramos, meanwhile, has invited South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam to visit Manila. 
  Manila pledged to support Seoul's bid for a non-permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council in 1996-97 and said it will not 
seek diplomatic normalization with North Korea before resolution 
of the nuclear problem. 
  Starting the first working day of his Asian tour here, 
visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu made the 
offer in talks with his Philippine counterpart Roberto Romulo 
and President Fidel Ramos, the director-general for Asian 
affairs at the Foreign Ministry, Yu Pyong-u, said after the 
meeting. 
  Both Ramos and Romulo responded positively but the two sides 
will need to discuss the format, Yu said. Ramos expressed his 
wish to invite President Kim to his country. 
  "The Philippines is the closest country to South Korea in 
the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)," Han told 
reporters Sunday. "We share similar experiences in recent 
political development, specifically in the democratization 
process, and there is much we can offer to the Philippines in 
terms of economic growth experience." 
  He said Seoul is thinking of a civilian forum that would be 
assisted by the government to guarantee a two-tier cooperation 
channel at both the official and unofficial levels. 
  Romulo and Ramos, on the other hand, suggested that the two 
countries form an "eminent persons group" or a think tank, Yu 
said. 
  The "special partnership" would be the first of its kind 
involving South Korea and a member of ASEAN. 
  Bilateral trade is increasing steadily and hit 1.25 billion 
U.S. dollars last year, with Seoul posting 934 million dollars 
in exports for a 617-million-dollar surplus. 
  Filipino soldiers, including President Ramos, fought for the 
Seoul side during the fratricidal 1950-53 Korean War. 
  Romulo, recalling his country's past cooperation in trying 
to 
defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis, pledged continued 
support, Yu said. 
  He sought better conditions for the estimated 8,000 
"undocumented" Filipino workers, asking that they be allowed to 
stay longer or that the quota of 3,000 who are officially 
accepted as foreign trainees be increased. 
  Han said he will review the issue at inter-ministerial 
talks, 
Yu said. 
  Han requested that South Korean banks be included in the 
list 
of foreign banks that will be given operating permits in the 
Philippines. 
  Manila revises its banking laws Tuesday, when it will give 
operating permits to 10 foreign banks chosen from different 
regions of the world. 
  Romulo and Ramos said they will "take note" of South Korea's 
request.

  [Text] The Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] has issued a 
directive to kill the leaders of the group loyal to Jose Maria 
Sison, Communist Party of the Philippines chief. This was 
revealed earlier today by Chief Superintendent Leandro Mendoza, 
Philippine National Police [PNP] director for intelligence. 
  According to Mendoza, the fight between the ABB and Sison 
loyalists might commence any day and may trigger violence in 
Metro Manila. 
  Mendoza refused to identify who among the leaders of Sison 
loyalists are included in the hit list of the ABB. Mendoza 
added that if the killings start, the peace process maybe 
affected. 
  As of now, the PNP is monitoring the activities of the two 
groups to prevent the outbreak of violence. 
  [Begin Mendoza recording in progress] ...because this might 
escalate to a point where they will be killing each other. And 
in the process, of course, neither of the group will admit to 
the slaying. The government might be blamed for the killings.

<F P=106> [From the "You and the Law" column by Raul J. Palabrica: </F>
"Inconsistency in Joma Sison's Position"] 
  [Text] Internal problems continue to wrack the ranks of the 
Leftist movement in the country. More than a year after 
President Ramos initiated peace talks with its umbrella 
organization, the National Democratic Front, the question of who 
between the leaders in the field and the officials based abroad 
has the moral authority to represent the movement in the 
negotiations remains unsolved. 
  The difference in opinion on how to approach this issue has 
led to the breakup of the once monolithic Communist Party of the 
Philippines (CPP) and its affiliate organizations. Three 
factions, all claiming to represent the legitimate aspirations 
of the oppressed masses, have emerged from the conflict. The 
intense ideological dispute is believed to have gone beyond the 
level of debate and claimed its first victim in the person of 
former NPA [New People's Army] Banahaw Command leader Leopoldo 
Mabilangan. A faction identified with Jose Ma. Sison, CPP 
founding chair, claimed responsibility for the death of 
Mabilangan. 
  The bloodletting is expected to continue in the wake of 
reports coming from Sison's camp that a "people's court" has 
found former CPP stalwarts Felimon Lagman, Arturo Tabara, Romulo 
Kintanar, and Ricardo Reyes guilty of serious crimes against the 
people and sentenced them to death. The verdict will be carried 
out by a group specially organized for that purpose. The 
announcement served to confirm Sison's earlier statements that 
his four rivals would be facing trial for their alleged crimes. 
  The news came shortly after reputed CPP Secretary General 
Wilma Tiamzon was arrested by elements of the Philippine 
National Police. When demands for the release of Tiamzon were 
not heeded by the government, Sison, speaking from The 
Netherlands, bewailed the arrest and detention as illegal 
(because the basis for the arrest, illegal possession of 
firearms, was dismissed by the prosecutor) and inhuman (because 
she is suffering from serious health problems). He threatened to 
pull the National Democratic Front out of the peace talks if 
Tiamzon would not be freed. 
  It is amazing how Sison can change from one ideological 
posture to another without batting an eyelash. A day after 
Tiamzon's arrest, he spoke on several radio talk shows to 
condemn the violation of Tiamzon's human rights. Without being 
forthright about it, he acknowledged that Tiamzon was entitled 
to all the rights and privileges that the Constitution 
guarantees to Filipino citizens suspected of having committed a 
crime. The same Constitution he refuses to accept as the 
framework within which the peace talks shall be conducted. 
  However, for former CPP leaders who dared question his 
handling of the affairs of the Leftist movement in the country, 
that adherence to democratic processes is non-existent. His 
critics are not in the same league as the run-of-the-mill 
politicians who criticize for the sheer joy of it or to attract 
attention. They are men who braved the guns of the military and 
bore the rigors of life in the mountains to keep the flame of 
the movement burning while Sison enjoyed the comforts of 
self-exile in Europe. Their past achievements, notwithstanding 
refusal to toe the line of the party chair, was considered a 
serious offense against the movement which deserved disciplinary 
action after hearing by a "people's court." 
  The word is out that a "people's court" has convened and 
decided that Sison's four erstwhile comrades should die for 
their crime. How the verdict was arrived at was never explained. 
Whether or not Lagman, Tabara, Kintanar, and Reyes were given 
the opportunity to defend themselves is a big question mark. As 
there are no transcripts of the proceedings, third parties can 
only speculate on what transpired in the trial assuming it was 
really held. One thing though is sure: the subject of the 
trial kept away from the places where Sison's faction holds fort 
in the wake of reports that his followers are after their head. 
  Noticeably, Sison has not expressed any concern for the 
human 
rights of the four "convicts" as he did for Tiamzon. Neither 
has he shown equivalent compassion for them and their families 
who now have to suffer the anguish of anticipating death 
whenever they sense the presence of unidentified or 
suspicious-looking persons in their midst. In Sison's book, 
those opposed to his rule enjoy less rights and privileges than 
the faithful who accept his doctrinaire teachings as gospel 
truth. The principle of equality of all social classes which is 
a cornerstone of the CPP's war for national liberation appears 
to have lost its meaning in the current strife within the 
Leftist movement. 
  It's time Sison accepted the reality that more than 30 years 
have passed since he started his struggle. The world's 
political climate has changed. The principal source of 
financial support for the movement, the Soviet Union, no longer 
exists. The dictator he fought so strongly against is already 
dead. A more democratic system of government is in place. The 
Marxist-Leninist doctrine on seizure of political power is no 
longer in tune with the times. A change in approach is 
necessary if Sison sincerely wants to play a significant role in 
the political development of our country. 
  Unless corrective measures are taken by its leadership, the 
"people's court" verdict on the four former CPP stalwarts may 
turn out to be the spark that would trigger the incineration of 
the Leftist movement in the country.

increase the stockpile of ammunitions for U.S. Forces in South 
Korea and Japan. A senior U.S. official even cried that a 
"decisive position" would be taken in the U.S.-led international 
action for a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  This shows the United States is very tenaciously working to 
intimidate the Korean people with strength and strangle the 
DPRK, says NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst continues: 
  The emergency dispatch of aircraft carriers and stockpiling 
of larger quantities of ammunitions are measures that can be 
taken only on the eve of war. Perry's statement suggests that 
the United States is stepping up preparations for making a 
military adventure against the DPRK any moment. 
  It is noteworthy that the United States is intensifying the 
campaign to stifle the DPRK by force of arms over its "nuclear 
issue." 
  The United States is leading the campaign of international 
reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK. This indicates 
that the U.S. schemes to inveigle other countries in a possible 
war it would provoke in Korea. 
  The U.S. is raising a hue and cry over the "nuclear issue" 
of 
the DPRK in an effort to find a pretext for a military adventure. 
  Strength and pressure never work on the DPRK. 
  If the U.S. warmaniacs make a military adventure in Korea, 
they will have to pay dearly for it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. clamor about 
war preparations of the Korean People's Army is a lie, said John 
M. Swomley, executive director of the American Committee on 
Korea, after visiting Panmunjom at the head of a delegation of 
the committee. 
  Noting that propaganda against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea is going on unabated in the United States, he 
said Americans are not well informed about the existence of the 
concrete wall dividing Korea into North and South. 
  He contended that the United States should pull its forces 
and nuclear weapons out of South Korea, saying the U.S. Forces 
have not withdrawn from South Korea still today when the "Cold 
War" has come to an end.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists on 
May 17 sent the overseas-based AWACs to the sky above South 
Korea to stage a joint air war exercise against the North with 
the puppets in the skies above Muju, Nonsan, Yoju and Yongwol, 
according to military sources. 
  The war gamble was aimed at testing the feasibility of the 
AWACs "E-3" command over combined flying corps and the accuracy 
of joint surprise strike at targets. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets deployed 10 
large-calibre guns, commandos, more than 100 military vehicles 
and thousands of puppet armed bandits in Paju County. 
  Meanwhile, the puppet tank groups deployed in Paju County 
fired scores of shells near the demilitarized zone of the 
military demarcation line and puppet armed helicopters launched 
support exercises for missile attack operation and ground attack 
in the sky above Yonchon County and Chorwon County, South Korean 
Kangwon Province.

<F P=106> ["Governments and International Organizations Urged To Take </F>
Joint Action Against Japan's Nuclear Armament" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
released a statement today concerning the exposure of an 
extra-large case in Japan -- the concealment of 70 kilograms of 
plutonium at the nuclear fuel-making factory in Tokaimura. 
  The statement reads: 
  Recently, the true color of Japan as a nuclear criminal was 
dragged into the light of day, causing quite a stir worldwide. 
  As was already reported, an extra-large case of the 
concealment of 70 kilograms of plutonium at the nuclear 
fuel-making factory in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, was 
disclosed. 
  Japan had so far boasted itself of its "uprightness", 
claiming that it had opened to the public the amount of 
plutonium stockpiled by it and had accepted "strict inspections" 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was disclosed 
recently that the Japanese authorities had not declared the 
amount of plutonium enough for the manufacture of nine nuclear 
bombs in the total inventory of plutonium, keeping it in 
secrecy. This clearly showed their shamelessness. The 
concealment of plutonium is a violation of the universally 
recognized international law, which should be taken seriously 
and denounced. 
  The case also clearly indicates that the socalled "three 
non- 
nuclear principles" advertised so often by Japan are nothing but 
a "screen" for concealing a large quantity of plutonium and 
accelerating nuclear armament in real earnest and the noisy row 
Japan has raised over the non-existent "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK, taking the van in the intrigues to stifle it, was 
motivated by a trick to veil its nuclear armament and divert the 
public attention elsewhere. 
  The Japanese authorities, caught red-handed, are these days 
vociferating about "probe into the truth" and "removal of 
suspicion," but no one will believe that. 
  Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan 
have been in operation for scores of years, it is self-evident 
that the recently discovered plutonium is only a tiny part of 
the amount concealed in Japan. 
  As regards Japan's production and concealment of much 
plutonium, the world public is demanding that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency treat it as a grave case and take relevant 
measures. It says if the IAEA Secretariat fails to take issue 
with the dangerous nuclear activities of Japan and continues to 
make the matters complicated over the fledgling peaceful nuclear 
activities of the DPRK, throwing "suspicion" on them, it cannot 
be construed otherwise than an application of a double standard. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must pay a due attention to this 
problem 
in compliance with the principle of impartiality. 
  The United States, which has used the "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK for a sinister political purpose, calling for a 
"cooperation system" to stifle the DPRK, joining hand with 
Japan, the real nuclear criminal, cannot evade the 
responsibility for the case. 
  We do not feel any need of serious argument about the poor 
lot of the South Korean authorities, who have recklessly made a 
fuss about "nuclear issue" of the North, currying favour with 
the United States and Japan, the two big powers. While the 
South Korean authorities ran about like mad, following Japan, 
the latter did what it wanted to. What a ridiculous sight it is. 
  The Japanese authorities must declare to the world public 
the 
exact total amount of plutonium now concealed nationwide, and 
immediately stop nuclear armament. 
  We consider that since it has been confirmed as a fact that 
Japan's nuclear armament is being promoted on the danger line, 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is practically 
meaningless. 
  We call on the governments of all countries, international 
organisations and anti-nuke organizations to make unbiased 
efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development from our 
planet and launch a joint action to check the nuclear armament 
recklessly accelerated by Japan with the ambition to become a 
military power and a nuclear power.

To Declare Total Amount of Its Plutonium" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry in a statement today regarding the discovery of 
70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear fuel-making plant in 
Tokaimura, Japan, says this extra-large case is a breach of the 
publicly recognized international law which must be taken as a 
serious case and condemned. 
  "This vividly shows that Japan's much-touted `three 
non-nuclear principles' are a `screen' for stepping up nuclear 
armament in full scale while keeping a large amount of plutonium 
in hiding and that the noisy row Japan has raised over the 
fictitious `nuclear issue' of the DPRK, taking the van in the 
intrigues to stifle it, is a petty trick to conceal its own 
nuclear armament and divert the public attention elsewhere", the 
spokesman says. 
  He urges the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency to pay due attention to this problem in compliance with 
the principle of impartiality. 
  "The United States which has abused the `nuclear issue' of 
the DPRK for its sinister political purposes, talking about a 
`cooperation system' aimed at `stifling' the DPRK in league with 
Japan, a nuclear criminal, can never evade its responsibility 
for this case," he says, and goes on: 
  "The Japanese authorities must declare to the international 
community the exact total amount of plutonium they keep in 
hiding nationwide and immediately stop their nuclear armament. 
  "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being 
promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality. 
  "We call upon the governments of all countries in the world, 
international organizations and anti-nuke organizations to exert 
unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development 
from our planet and, in particular, to take a joint action 
against Japan's nuclear armament which is being accelerated 
recklessly with the ambition to become a military power, a 
nuclear power."

<F P=106> ["Impudent Remarks" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Hata reportedly claimed again that Japan should take a permanent 
seat on the UN Security Council [UNSC]. Speaking at the plenary 
session of the House of Representatives on May 16, he said 
"calls for Japan to play its role in the new era have come from 
the United Nations." 
  His remarks are a mockery of the unbiased opinion of the 
international community which has consistently opposed Japan's 
shameless attempt to obtain a permanent seat in the UN Security 
Council. 
  Now, Japan is scheming to call back the militarist spectre 
of 
the past, crudely violating the UN Charter. 
  All the more grave is the fact that Japan is stepping up its 
nuclear armament and its conversion into a military power in an 
effort to carry this criminal scheme into effect. 
  It is only too clear that a war criminal, a nuclear 
criminal, 
cannot become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  As the international community opines fairly, Japan has 
neither justification nor elementary qualification to hold a 
responsible position in the UN. 
  Japan, a criminal state which unleashed the Second World 
War, 
has yet to cleanse her dishonour as an "enemy state" stipulated 
in the UN charter, and yet to apologize for the crimes it 
committed against the Korean and other Asian nations in the past 
and make compensations for the damages. 
  Japan must clearly liquidate her crime-woven past and stop 
her nuclear armament and moves to become a military power for 
domination over Asia, instead of impudently coveting for a 
responsible position in the UN.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), 
sent to international organisations, peace, democratic and 
solidarity organisations and prominent figures of many countries 
around the world an appeal for a solidarity movement to force 
the Japanese authorities to stop persecuting and suppressing 
Chongnyon and Korean nationals in Japan. 
  The appeal recalls that persecution and suppression of 
Koreans is openly committed in Japan and on the 25th of April 
the Japanese police searched the Osaka Prefectural headquarters 
of Chongnyon and its branch offices by letting loose scores of 
riot police vehicles and more than 1,300 policement. 
  The appeal says: 
  "It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese authorities are 
trying to justify their massive arms buildup by spreading rumors 
about `threat from North Korea' through all the propaganda 
machines and media and, furthermore, to pave the way for a 
comeback to the Korean peninsula and Asia by enacting a 
'security emergency law' and forcing constitution revision at 
any cost. 
  "The Japanese authorities, far from deeply repenting of, and 
apologizing and compensating for the colonial domination over 
Korea and the past crimes against the Korean people, are 
persecuting the Koreans in Japan, the direct victims of the 
colonial domination, and savagely suppressing the Chongnyon 
organisation that speaks for their democratic national rights 
under the groundless pretext. We sternly denounce this, 
branding it as one more crime against humanitarianism." 
  "In view of the grave situation today, we appeal to our 
friends worldwide who love justice and peace to launch a 
solidarity movement protesting the unpardonable persecution and 
suppression of Chongnyon and Korean nationals in Japan by the 
Japanese authorities and calling for its immediate halt."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- "We will fight, holding 
ever higher the banner of independence, democracy and 
reunification held aloft by the patriotic martyrs, undauntedly 
facing brutal suppression by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim 
Yong-sam clique and thereby overthrow the colonial fascist rule 
of the U.S. imperialists and establish an independent government 
of the nation in order not to spoil the price of blood shed by 
the valiant fighters of the Kwangju resistance," declared Cho 
Il-min, chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front (Hanminjon), in a statement issued on 
Tuesday on the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising. 
  "The uprising made the South Korean people clearly see that 
the United States is an aggressor and murderer, not a friend," 
he said. "Unless the Americans are driven away, the South Korean 
people cannot get rid of colonial slavery nor can achieve the 
democratisation of society and the independent, peaceful 
reunification of the country." 
  Cho Il-min further said: 
  "We will wage the anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle more 
courageously, never forgetting the heinous crimes committed by 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the military fascist 
murderers in slaying in cold blood Kwangju citizens who 
courageously rose in the uprising for independence, democracy 
and reunification and turning Kwangju into a blood. 
  "The United States must take steps to pull its forces and 
nuclear weapons out of South Korea, clearly seeing that there is 
no room for it to stay in South Korea where anti-U.S. sentiments 
are growing day by day and not making light of the unshakable 
will of the South Korean people to fight it out to defend the 
national sovereignty. 
  "The United States must renounce its policy of isolating and 
stifling the DPRK over the `nuclear issue', sincerely seek a 
peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula 
through the medium of DPRK-USA negotiations and respond to the 
just proposal of the DPRK to replace the armistice agreement 
with a peace agreement."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass rally 
was held at the Pyongyang indoor stadium today to mark the 14th 
anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular uprising. 
  It was attended by Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the 
C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and 
vice president of the DPRK, Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the C.C., 
the WPK, Chang Chol, vice-premier of the Administration Council, 
and other senior officials, 10,000 citizens and Koreans from 
abroad. 
  South Korean students and people rose up in a mass uprising 
in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, fought "martial law troops" and 
armed themselves with the weapons they wrested from the enemy 
and completely controlled and defended Kwangju city for more 
than ten days. The heroic resistance involved more than a 
million students and citizens. 
  In his speech at the rally, Kang Hyon-su, member of the 
C.C., 
the WPK and chief secretary of the Pyongyang Municipal Party 
Committee and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's 
Committee, said the Kwangju popular uprising was a just 
anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance of the South 
Korean people who turned out against the U.S. imperialists' 
colonial rule and the extension of the "Yusin" fascist 
dictatorship and for the democratization of society and the 
reunification of the country and a mass armed uprising in which 
the entire citizens of Kwangju waged a death-defying resistance 
in the teeth of fascist violence. 
  The U.S. imperialists transferred 70,000 puppet troops, 150 
tanks and armored vehicles under their command to the military 
fascists to put down the uprising. 
  In some ten days, the South Korean military fascist clique 
killed more than 5,000 people and injured 14,000. 
  "Through the Kwangju popular uprising, the South Korean 
people clearly learned that U.S. imperialism is the strangler of 
independence and democracy and the chieftain of aggression and 
murder and gained at the cost of blood the lesson that no 
desires could be realised as long as the U.S. imperialist 
aggression forces remain in South Korea," said the speaker. 
  He said that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam left intact, the 
bitter grudges of the Kwangju resistance fighters cannot be 
settled and there will be nothing but confrontation and war 
between fellow countrymen. 
  The earnest desire of the participants of the Kwangju 
uprising for independence, democracy and reunification must be 
realised without fail, he added. 
  The speaker continued: 
  "As long as the U.S. Forces remain in South Korea and the 
U.S. colonial rule continues, no desire of the South Korean 
people can be realised. 
  "The United States must make a bold decision to withdraw its 
aggressor troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea in 
accordance with the trend of the times and the demand of our 
nation and approach the DPRK-USA talks with a sincere attitude 
and position for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  "It is our unshakable position to answer dialogue with 
dialogue and war with war. 
  "The United States must clearly see the indomitable will and 
stamina of our people and stop the campaign over `nuclear issue' 
aimed at stifling Korean-style socialism centred on the masses. 
  "The United States must accede to our proposal for 
establishing a new peace arrangement since the Korean Armistice 
Agreement has been reduced to a sheet of paper incapable of 
preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and the military 
armistice commission cannot perform its mission due to her 
illegalities. 
  "The South Korean students and people must wage a powerful 
mass struggle in all areas for the abolition of the `National 
Security Law' and other fascist laws and all repressive machines 
and courageously fight to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime and establish a genuine independent democratic government 
of the people." 
  Representatives of various social strata also took the 
floor. 
  They all stressed that the South Korean people must 
undauntedly wage the anti-U.S. struggle for independence to 
terminate the colonial rule of the United States, achieve the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the country and 
realise what the participants of the Kwangju uprising desired.

<F P=106> ["Anti-U.S. Joint Meeting of Students in North and South </F>
Korea To Mark 14th Anniversary of Heroic Kwangju Popular 
Uprising" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- An anti-U.S. joint 
meeting of Kim Chaek University of Technology in the North and 
Chonnam National University in South Korea took place here today 
to mark the 14th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular 
uprising. 
  The joint meeting was due to be held in Pyongyang and 
Kwangju 
of South Korea at the same time today on the patriotic 
initiative of the General Student Council of Chonnam National 
University to realize the noble aspirations of the participants 
in the uprising. 
  Speaking at the meeting here, Pak Chang-kwang, vice-chairman 
of the Student Committee Kim Chaek University of Technology, and 
others said although the Kwangju popular uprising which started 
because of the frantic repressive offensive by the U.S. 
imperialists and their stooges, the remnants of "Yusin", failed 
due to brutal armed suppression by the oppressors, it was a just 
patriotic resistance which recorded a most brilliant chapter in 
the South Korean students and people's history of anti-U.S., 
anti-fascist struggle and the biggest massive uprising 
unprecedented in the modern history of national liberation 
struggle. 
  They pointed out that the noble desire of the participants 
in 
the Kwangju popular uprising for independence, democracy and 
reunification has not been realized although 14 years have 
passed since the uprising and the rancour of thousands of 
Kwangju citizens who were murdered in cold blood has not been 
wreaked. 
  Noting that the U.S. imperialists were pushing the situation 
on the Korean peninsula to a touch-and-go phase of nuclear war 
on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, 
they said the South Korean students and people should wage a 
more unremitting anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to 
get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and their nuclear 
weapons withdrawn from South Korea and smash their nuclear war 
provocation moves. 
  They stressed that the entire students of the university 
would join hands firmly with the fellow students of Chonnam 
National University in South Korea and wage a vigorous struggle 
to achieve national unity and make a breakthrough in the 
reunification of the country, upholding the "10-point programme 
of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of 
the country" advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  A declaration on the establishment of sisterly relations and 
a resolution on the joint struggle against the U.S. imperialists 
and for the resignation of Kim Yong-sam were read at the 
meeting. 
  The resolution says they, as students responsible for the 
future of the country and the nation, cannot remain a mere 
onlooker to the aggressive and treacherous acts of the United 
States and its stooges. It indicates common fighting goals of 
the students of Kim Chaek University of Technology and Chonnam 
National University to decisively counter them. 
  The declaration says the students in the North and the South 
would develop independent exchange and contribute to achieving 
the great unity of the whole nation, assume their looks as 
students of the generation of reunification and contribute to 
the reunification of the country in '95.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A ceremony and an 
all-people rally marking the lapse of 14 years since the May 18 
Kwangju popular resistance took place at the plaza in front of 
the South Cholla "provincial government" Wednesday with the 
attendance of some 30,000 citizens and students in Kwangju, 
according to media reports from Seoul. 
  The participants in the rally looked back on the days of the 
significant resistance and strongly demanded an investigation 
into the Kwangju bloodbath. 
  They vowed to solve the issues of checking rice market 
opening and achieving national reunification in the spirit 
displayed in the resistance and strongly demanded an end to the 
suppression of the labour movement. Then they made a street 
march. 
  Meanwhile, a memorial service for the martyrs of the Kwangju 
resistance took place in front of the railway station near the 
Mangwoldong Cemetery where they lie bried with the bereaved 
families, members of organizations concerned and public figures 
from different parts of South Korea in attendance. Meetings for 
inheriting the spirit of the May uprising were held in Mokpo and 
Haenam where resistance fighters had gathered. 
  Earlier, on the 17th, more than 2,000 students from 13 
universities affiliated with the South Korean Federation of 
General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), met at Yonsei campus in 
Seoul to vow to inherit the spirit of the may resistance and 
invigorate the struggle for democracy before staging a street 
march and a demonstration. 
  They burnt a big U.S. flag and an effigy of a Patriot 
missile. 
  Members of the National Alliance for democracy and 
reunification and students of Hanchongnyon, more than 1,500 in 
all, who participated in a rally in Seoul on the same day for 
the investigation into Kwangju massacre and the punishment of 
those responsible for it presented to the puppet Seoul District 
prosecutor's office an indictment calling for the punishment of 
35 murderers including Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the chief 
culprits of the Kwangju bloodbath. 
  The Mokpo Association of the Civic Movement for Democracy 
and 
Students of Mokpo University sued the 35 murderers at the Mokpo 
branch of the Kwangju district prosecutor's office.

<F P=106> [Telephone message from Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the </F>
Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, to Kang 
Yong-hun, president of the ROK Red Cross Society, on 19 May] 
  [Text] Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of DPRK Red Cross 
Society Central Committee, today sent a telephone message to 
Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, 
demanding again that South Korea respond to our proposal for the 
repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan -- long-term 
prisoners who refused to renounce communism -- and for providing 
Kim Chi-yon, the daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, another person who 
refused to renounce communism, who is seriously ill, with 
medical treatment. 
  The contents of the telephone message were as follows: 
  On 26 and 27 April, I sent telephone messages to you, 
demanding that South Korea repatriate Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
prisoners of war, and that it send the seriously ill Kim 
Chi-yon, daughter of Kim Pyong-chu who refused to renounce 
communism, to the North, for medical treatment. 
  To date, your side has not taken any measures for our 
proposals that need to be settled immediately. Furthermore, 
your side did not even reply. This cannot be regarded as proper 
behavior befitting Red Cross men who regard humanity as sacred 
and saving mankind from misfortune as their basic mission. 
  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken as prisoners by 
the 
U.S. Forces during their guerrilla struggles in the South in the 
past years of war, are clearly prisoners of war in view of 
international law. Therefore, your side is obliged to 
repatriate them to our side. Article 118 of the Geneva 
Convention of 12 August 1949 regarding the treatment for 
prisoners of war defines that prisoners of war must be released 
and repatriated immediately after a hostile action ends. Also, 
Article 20 of the Hague Convention of 1907 regarding laws on 
land battle and practice defines that after a treaty is 
concluded, the repatriation of prisoners of war should be 
carried out as quickly as possible. 
  Nevertheless, your side has stated that Kim In-so and Ham 
Se- 
hwan, prisoners of war, cannot be repatriated due to the South 
Korean National Security Law, which has aroused protest from the 
international community. This is wrong behavior in which you 
are employing international law in your own way. 
  Furthermore, your side acts as if you are interested in the 
humanitarian issue, ignoring the issue of repatriating Kim In-so 
and Ham Se-hwan, which is more important than the issue of 
separated families. This is a very wrong attitude. 
  Also, it is very regrettable that without any plausible 
reasons, your side has not yet positively reacted to our 
humanitarian proposal to provide Kim Chi-yon, the daughter of 
Kim Pyong-chu, who refused converting from communism, with 
medical treatment in the North. 
  Neglecting to say that your side will provide medical 
treatment for Kim Chin-yon, who is seriously ill, your side has 
ignored our proposal that we provide her with medical treatment 
in the North. This can be regarded as an attitude of ignoring 
the basic duty and mission of Red Cross men. 
  The DPRK Red Cross Society Central Committee sincerely 
advises [chunggohada] your organization not to follow 
authorities of the South side, who pursue North-South 
confrontation, but instead to be faithful to the basic duty of 
the Red Cross. Thus, it again strongly demands that your side 
positively respond to our humanitarian proposals from now on.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Yi Song-ho, acting 
chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, 
in a telephone message to the president of the South Korean Red 
Cross today, strongly urged the South side once again to show an 
affirmative response to the North's humanitarian proposals 
before it is too late. 
  Noting that the South side has not shown any response to the 
North's proposals for the repatriation to the North of Kim In-so 
and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war now under detention in South 
Korea, and of Kim Chi-hyon, a daughter of Kim Pyong-chu who was 
an unconverted prisoner, now suffering from a serious illness, 
the message says: 
  This cannot be deemed a righteous behavior of the Red Cross 
men whose essential mission is to show noble humanitarianism by 
saving human beings from misfortunes and helping them. 
  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who were taken prisoners by the 
U.S. Forces side while engaging in guerrilla activities in the 
South Korean area during the Korean war are obviously prisoners 
of war in view of the international law, and your side is 
obliged to send them back to our side. 
  This notwithstanding, your side is dealing with their issue 
according to the "National Security Law" of South Korea which is 
now being denounced by the international community. This is, 
indeed, a wrong act of interpreting and applying the 
international law in a self-centred way. 
  Moreover, your side is behaving as if it were interested in 
humanitarian issues, while disregarding the question of 
repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, a more urgent matter 
than the problem of separated families. This is an extremely 
improper act. 
  Failing to manifest any intention to give medical assistance 
to Kim Chi-hyon now in a critical condition, your side turned 
down our offer to fetch and treat her here. This cannot be 
construed otherwise than an attitude of neglecting the duty and 
mission of the Red Cross men. 
  The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society 
sincerely 
advises your organization not to follow the South side's 
authorities who pursue North-South confrontation but to remain 
faithful to its duty as a Red Cross organization.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Feelings of respect and 
reverence for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are growing 
deeper among South Korean pressmen and students with every 
passing day. 
  A journalist in Inchon surnamed Yi, giving his view of the 
question of the future of the nation and its leader some time 
ago, told his colleagues: 
  "The dignity of a nation is in direct proportion to the 
greatness of its leader. 
  "Any nation can exalt its dignity and honour and prosper 
forever only when it has the heir to its leader in the person of 
a distinguished great man who had the steadfast idea of national 
independence and serve-the-people spirit, rare passion, fighting 
spirit and faith. 
  "This is a philosophy proven by historical facts. 
  "The independent position and dignity of our nation are 
rising steadily among the international community today because 
it has acclaimed Mr. Kim Chong-il, the greatest thinker and 
theoretician of the present times, with outstanding leadership 
ability, noble virtues and great attraction, as the heir to 
President Kim Il-song." 
  Hearing his words with deep emotions, his colleagues 
unanimously evinced their determination to staunchly fight under 
the guidance of the dear leader. 
  A journalist Sin with a newspaper office in Seoul highly 
praised the outstanding intelligence of Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  He told his fellow journalists: 
  "The dear leader Kim Chong-il equipped with both literary 
and 
military accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander 
with an unshakable faith and a distinguished great statesman of 
sound judgement and with outstanding leadership ability. 
  "He is an outstanding leader of the international socialist 
movement who is meeting the challenge of the imperialist allied 
forces with his matchless grit and iron will and guiding the 
movement for rebuilding socialism, standing at the centre of 
world politics." 
  A postgraduate of Seoul National University surnamed Kim, 
chatting with his fellows about the reality of the northern half 
of the country some time ago, said: 
  "The dear leader Kim Chong-il is the great of great born 
with 
the gifts of a sage such as clairvoyance, matchless grit and 
extraordinary personality. 
  "He is a great statesman with both literary and military 
accomplishments and outstanding leadership ability, and the most 
famous general in the world. 
  "I am sure that the world will turn in the future into an 
anthropocentric socialist world true to the intentions of the 
dear leader Kim Chong-il, into such a world where the people 
enjoy all happiness and comfort." 
  The fellow students expressed sympathy with him, highly 
praising Mr. Kim Chong-il as the leader guiding the new 
independent world, as a leader of the world whom the world 
people look up to and follow.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in an 
editorial today calls for further intensifying ideological 
education among the party members and other working people. 
  To give precedence to the ideological education of the party 
members and other working people is a consistent policy of the 
Workers' Party of Korea. 
  The editorial says ideological education is the work to 
train 
the party members and other working people to be genuine 
revolutionaries of Chuche type and arouse them to the 
revolutionary struggle and construction work. 
  Ideological revolution is the pilot of the revolution, the 
editorial notes, and goes on: 
  Ideological front is an acute battlefront in confrontation 
with the imperialists. 
  Today the imperialists are intensifying their anti-socialist 
ideological offensive as never before. In order to smash 
corrupt bourgeois ideology, morality and way of life and 
maintain the purity of socialism it is imperative to fully 
prepare the people ideologically. 
  The ideological revolution is a mighty way of defeating 
imperialism and achieving the victory of socialism. 
  Intensifying ideological education still further is a 
decisive guarantee for successfully carrying out the 
revolutionary tasks facing our party and revolution. 
  Only when ideological education is intensified, is it 
possible to make the party members and other working people 
effect a fresh upswing on all fronts of socialist construction, 
breaking through difficulties. 
  What is important in intensifying ideological education at 
present is to make all the party members and other working 
people cherish singlehearted loyalty and unite around the party 
and the leader as firm as a rock. 
  The editorial also lays stress on continuously pushing ahead 
with the work of firmly arming the party members and other 
working people with the Chuche idea and the revolutionary 
traditions of our party and on intensifying education in 
socialist patriotism among them to infuse them with noble 
patriotism of defending the country. 
  The editorial calls for concentrating efforts on the 
education of youth and children, the successor to the revolution 
in particular.

reporters after meeting with visiting South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu. 
  The visiting minister had been granted an audience with His 
Majesty the King before meeting with Prasong. 
  The UN membership issue has also raised at a meeting between 
Han Sung-chu and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, along with 
Chuan's planned visit to South Korea between June 23 and 26 at 
the invitation of President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Chuan asked South Korea to open its markets to more Thai 
agricultural products, including tapioca and frozen chicken, to 
reduce the trade deficit, Prasong said. He quoted Chuan as 
saying Thai imports from South Korea were mostly high-cost 
industrial goods while Thai exports were mainly agricultural 
products. 
  Han Sung-chu, who arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday from the 
Philippines, is on a three-day official visit to Thailand to 
promote bilateral relations. He will leave for Vietnam and 
Indonesia today. 
  The South Korean minister discussed with Thai leaders 
tension 
over the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula. Thailand, a 
member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a party to 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has good ties with the 
both North and South Korea. 
  Other topics included Cambodia, Burma and the upcoming ASEAN 
Regional Forum which South Korea will be attending along with 16 
other countries in the Asia Pacific region. The forum is the 
first of its kind for ASEAN. 
  Prasong said North Korea could join the forum only after the 
Korean Peninsula issue is solved. North Korea has canvassed 
ASEAN governments for support to attend, claiming that they 
should not be excluded because they are part of the Asia Pacific 
region. 
  Fearing that the forum could turn into a "boxing match" 
between the two Koreas, ASEAN officials viewed North Korea's 
participation as a prospect for the "longer term", when there 
are positive signs in the dialogues between North Korea and the 
United States. 
  "South Korea thinks that in order to resolve the nuclear 
issue and also deal with the problems we have with the North, 
dialogue is essential. Unfortunately right now there is no 
dialogue. We hope North Korea will open dialogue so we can 
improve relations and also resolve the nuclear problem," Han 
told reporters. He said South Korea was ready for talks 
anywhere, at any level, and as soon as possible. He noted that 
at present the response from the North was negative. 
  Han said that dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea 
depended on the outcome of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency inspection, expected in the next two weeks.

  [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday 
ruled out the possibility of embattled Member of Parliament [MP] 
Thanong Siriprichaphong being prosecuted in Thailand unless 
Washington provides more evidence to substantiate drug 
trafficking accusations against him. 
  Chawalit said after meeting with other senior officials 
concerned that the U.S. government had only provided a copy of 
its indictment against Thanong. That was not sufficient to 
prosecute a case before a Thai court, he said. 
  At the meeting with Chawalit were Deputy Permanent Secretary 
Ari Wong-araya, Interior Ministry legal adviser Chailoet 
Ditsamnat, national Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop, Deputy 
Police Chief Pol Gen Phot Bunyachinda, Assistant Police Chief 
Thanu Homhuan and Chawalit's personal secretary, Sonchai 
Montriwat. 
  "The copy of the U.S. indictment cannot alone be used as 
evidence to substantiate drug allegations against Thanong. The 
police cannot do anything at present," Chawalit said. 
  The minister has ordered Prathin to ask the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) for more details relating to the charges. 
  Chawalit also said he wants more information from Washington 
about Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's revelation that 17 
other Thai MPs stand accused by the U.S. of being involved in 
drug trafficking. 
  Chawalit has ordered the Office of Narcotics Control Board 
to 
gather evidence related to the Thanong issue. Prathin said he 
is awaiting additional information from the Foreign Ministry. 
  Asked to confirm a Chat Thai Party statement that Thanong 
faces only six months in jail if convicted here of drug 
trafficking, Chawalit said he does not know the penalty involved. 
  Given adequate evidence, Prathin said, Thanong would not 
escape prosecution on any drug charges just because of his 
stature or influence. 
  Attorney General Ophat Arunin said yesterday the government 
should decide quickly whether to extradite Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong to face drug trafficking charges in the United 
States. Ophat will testify today before the House committee on 
parliamentary affairs which is investigating the issue. He 
would infomm the committee of all information he received from 
U.S. officials.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time to clean up the dirty laundry"] </F>
  [Text] Last week in Taiwan, police broke up a heroin sales 
operation. The drugs were made in Burma, and sold in Taiwan by 
Singaporeans. The managers of the heroin ring were Hong Kong 
triad members who live in Thailand. Drugs entered Taiwan aboard 
ships of various nationality, sent mixed among other cargo by 
Bangkok transport agencies. Operations were masterminded across 
international satellite telephone connections, and profits were 
banked somewhere, although police are not yet sure where. This 
was, authorities point out, only a "small" smuggling operation 
responsible for dumping an estimated 50 kilograms of heroin per 
month on hapless addicts in Taiwan. 
  It is no wonder, then, that leaders of the international 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) were in town last week 
pushing for new laws to combat drug smuggling. National police 
forces, up against an organized foe which is both sophisticated 
and ruthless, are losing the battle against addictive drugs. 
The international scope of the narcotics business is obvious. 
It is equally plain that drug traffickers only can be combated 
through international cooperation. Thailand must consider 
accepting the call of the world community to enact new, tough 
laws against money laundering. 
  FATF is a five-year-old group with a growing membership, 
funded by the G-7, of the world's second richest nations. It is 
mainly a lobbying group, formed to convince countries and 
bankers alike that it is in their own interest to monitor huge 
flows of cash. By watching where such money goes, FATF and its 
backers argue, big time drug dealers can be identified, 
investigated and ultimately put out of business. It is a 
compelling argument to beleaguered anti-narcotics agents. FATF 
President John Gieve told our officials it also should be 
attractive to the very people involved -- our bankers. "A 
country or a center which wishes to attract the top names will 
find it easier to do so if they have in place anti-money 
laundering legislation," Mr Gieve said. 
  Some read this statement as a threat. But it is, instead, a 
promise. Cash transactions with banks are becoming ever more 
tightly controlled throughout the world. Even where banking is 
traditionally secretive and protective of the customer, such as 
in Switzerland, large transfers now are routinely reported to 
the police if the banks have any suspicion about their origin. 
Banks and nations which cooperate in anti-laundering efforts 
get more international business when they enter the financial 
centers. 
  Efforts to combat drugs kingpins have more and more targeted 
their fortunes. Sales of narcotics are performed with cash for 
a variety of reasons, just as most legitimate commerce is done 
more and more with paper. Warlords have assembled armies which 
outgun most police forces, but the bosses of the drug gangs must 
convert their profits. Money laundering is aimed at converting 
"dirty money" from drugs into "legitimate money," which then can 
be used for any purpose -- even for buying entire governments. 
  Anti-laundering laws are the legal version of the famous 
Watergate maxim on how to catch villains: "Follow the money." A 
huge cash deposit may be attractive to a banker. But unless he 
knows the businessman making the deposit, money-laundering laws 
require him to report the transaction to authorities. This 
opens up a new line of inquiry to authorities. If written 
carefully and enforced without favor, such laws will not affect 
honest citizens, and will enhance the reputation of banks which 
participate. 
  Clearly, no inroads will be made against major drug 
trafficking without international cooperation and effort. 
Already, neighbors such as Australia, Japan Hong Kong and 
Singapore have passed tough anti-laundering laws, without harm 
to the business of their banks nor the privacy of their people. 
Unquestionably, the Government must consider such legislation 
carefully, and seek advice both from other countries and our own 
judicial experts before acting. But action on money-laundering 
must be taken soon. 
  Because Thailand is a front-line drugs state, the Government 
must take the responsibility of acting. Drug use already harms 
our country badly in many areas, from the spread of AIDS through 
massive corruption and countless petty crimes by desperate 
addicts. Because it is close to the production centers in Burma 
and Laos, Thailand also attracts major traffickers. Our 
country, and our banks, are healthy enough to reject drugs 
money. The Thai Government should take action to make the 
country increasingly unattractive for drug traffickers. A 
careful, but tough, anti-laundering law would mark a major step 
in such an effort.

  [Text] He Zhiqang, the governor of China's Yunnan 
Province, called on Board of Investment [BOI] Secretary General 
Sathaphon Kawitanon last week. During the talks, the Yunnan 
governor asked the BOI to promote Thai investment in southern 
China as part of the hexagon sub-regional economic development 
project. 
  BOI Secretary General Sathaphon told reporters after the 
meeting that the Yunnan governor wanted more foreign 
participation to support his plan to move towards a 
market-oriented economy. Thailand has so far invested in 11 
projects worth U.S. $50 million in Yunnan and ranks as its 6th 
most active foreign investor. Its businessmen invest mostly in 
small and medium-sized enterprises. Two of the 11 projects are 
supported by the BOI. 
  During the meeting, the BOI secretary general said Thai 
businessmen have recognized the investment opportunities in 
Yunnan well, but they felt obstructed by the inadequate 
infrastructure. Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang said a large amount 
of Thai investment would likely enter Yunnan when the 
construction of a highway linking Thailand and southern China is 
completed. He Zhiqiang is accompanied by a nine-member 
delegation including the Mayor of Kunming. 
  Yunnan needs foreign investment to develop its economy. To 
date, 129 foreign investments in projects worth U.S. $500 
million have been undertaken in Yunnan. Hong Kong investors are 
the most active, followed by the Taiwanese, Japanese, 
Singaporeans, Americans, and Thais. The most active sectors are 
machinery, agriculture, food, real estate, hotels, and chemicals. 
  The BOI secretary general said Thailand might participate in 
zinc and coal mining, or in agriculture. Moreover, nearby 
Vietnam has a number of waterfalls that can accommodate 
hydro-electric plants. However, he noted that businessmen have 
found it difficult to transport their products from Yunnan to 
other areas due to the inadequate infrastructure. But, this 
problem will be solved soon because Thailand and China are 
planning to link Thailand to southern China as part of the 
hexagon economic development project.

  According to the schedule, the session will examine and pass 
six draft laws, including the draft labor code, the draft law on 
domestic investment promotion, the draft law on taxes on the 
transfer of land ownership, the draft of the (revised) law on 
military service, the draft of the revised law on people's 
council and people's committee organizations, and the draft of 
the revised law on people's council elections. The session will 
also consider a draft civil code. 
  With the draft law on the state budget in particular, the 
committee initially planned to present this legislation for 
passage at the Fifth National Assembly Session. Later the 
committee was requested by the government to ask the National 
Assembly to postpone consideration until the Sixth National 
Assembly Session, as this draft law is very important and may 
affect socioeconomic development. 
  The session will hear a government report and consider 
implementation of the resolution on practicing thrift, fighting 
wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling. 
  The session will also include reports on the National 
Assembly Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the 
Supreme People's Organ of Control, the Nationalities Council, 
and other National Assembly committees during the first six 
months of 1994.

  [Text] Since early this year, the antismuggling forces of 
An Giang and Can Tho provinces have uncovered 21,000 cases of 
smuggling across the southwestern border or in transit through 
the western border gate with contraband amounting to 12.339 
billiong dong. They forces have collected 6,180 billion dong as 
fines and back taxes and have confiscated over 1,279,000 packs 
of foreign-brand cigarettes. In An Giang alone, over one million 
packs of cigarettes have been imported illegally. 
  Lately, because of our regular control over various ground 
routes, smugglers have shifted to shipping their goods along 
riverways. They have rented boats for transportation and have 
hidden their contraband cigarettes under layers of farm products. 
  Other kinds of contraband originate mostly from China and 
are 
smuggled through the northern border and from Thailand through 
the southwestern border into the western region. 
  Smuggling has also increased sharply in Binh Dinh in the 
first four months of 1994, compared to the same period in 1993. 
The volume of contraband has been increasing rapidly as 
long-range commercial ships are plying the Binh Dinh sea area 
with each bringing in between 2,000-3,500 sets of television or 
video recorders; and cigarettes, and beers of all brands. So 
far, the province market control committee has collected 502 
million dong as fines or back taxes for the budget. The value 
of contraband in retention now and in which action has yet to be 
taken is estimated to be worth 1.4 billion dong.

<F P=106> [Article by Communist Party of Vietnam Politburo Member Vu </F>
Oanh: "Job Creation: A Fundamental and Urgent Task of Mass 
Mobilization Work"] 
  [Text] As defined under our country's socioeconomic 
stabilization and development strategy until 2000, "job creation 
and optimum use of the work force constitute objectives of 
primary importance and serve as the criteria for economic 
development orientations and technology selection..." 
  One of the important objectives of the research on 
contemporary international development is to focus on work 
safety and human resources development to ensure that all things 
originate from, belong to, and serve the people. The human 
factor becomes the very objective of people's employment. 
  Human resources development covers fundamental factors like 
work safety, food safety, environmental protection, cultural 
development ... The nature and objectives of job development 
projects rest with each individual person's creative and chosen 
work aimed at happiness for himself and the community. The work 
force constitutes the most valuable factor of development; the 
mainstay of knowledge, personality, and ethics; and the 
essential element of happiness. In addition to the fact that 
human knowledge is acquired genetically, a person may improve 
his or her background to an important degree thanks to his or 
her life experiences. Furthermore, in modern times, owing to 
the marvelous development of science and technology, human 
knowledge has played a direct role in production. Employment is 
part of a citizens' rights and duties. It is also the 
preliminary condition of the laboring people's subsistence, and 
covers different forms of activities not prohibited by law and 
that help bring about gratification and generate income for 
citizens. 
  The settlement of the unemployment problem must be 
understood 
in a new context, as efforts must be made to not limit job 
development projects solely within the bounds of the social 
welfare program and of attempts to get rid of the ills of 
unemployment, underemployment, inefficiency, and low income. 
Instead, they should be regarded as part of an overall effort 
to create every opportunity for citizens to enjoy educational 
opportunities and make better preparations so they may become 
people of virtue, earn a living, participate in creative work, 
enjoy the fruit of legitimate employment, have their material 
and intellectual property rights protected by law, improve their 
quality of life, seek personal happiness, and contribute to the 
well-being of the community. 
  Under the system of bureaucratic centralism and state 
subsidization, the state created jobs for everyone, mainly 
through the state and collective economies. Citizens were 
dutybound to work, but did not have the right to create jobs 
themselves or fully enjoy the fruits of their labor. Generally 
speaking, personnel recruitment was banned and no incentives 
were given to encourage people to bring their wisdom or business 
skills into full play. This led to a situation in which 
production came to a standstill, with people living in poverty 
and unable to make ends meet. There were instances in which as 
much as 10 percent of the population suffered from food 
shortages. Absenteeism prevailed in the state apparatus. The 
people were worried. The regime was plunged into a crisis 
situation. 
  Through the renovation policy, which is aimed at releasing 
the working class and production forces, a vigorous movement to 
look for ways of earning a living began in the rural areas and 
later spread throughout the country, thus completely shifting 
our nation from unemployment and food shortages to enthusiasm 
for work and dynamic business and production activities. Many 
positive changes have been made in everyone's attitude and in 
other aspects of the national situation. Generally speaking, 
marked progress has been made in the job market and in the 
improvement of material and spiritual life. Thanks to creative 
work and efforts to overcome dangers, the people have become 
more self-confident. The party-people relations have been 
consolidated by challenges and shown indications of better 
quality. 
  Nevertheless, our efforts to resolve the unemployment 
problem 
and improve living conditions in the framework of the renovation 
policy are facing major shortcomings and difficulties. As a 
result of the heavy impact of the population explosion (2.29 
percent) coupled with a growing increase in the work force (3.5 
percent per year), about 1.1 million young people reach working 
age each year. There are of about 2.2 million unemployed 
people in the cities, nearly 10 percent of the urban population. 
This ratio is beyond the limit for public security. Urban 
residents account for 20 percent of the population. This fact 
constitutes the underlying cause of social vices like 
prostitution, drug addiction, theft, and robbery resulting in 
the death of victims ... Most of the unemployed people are 
youths and 85 percent of them do not have any skills. In the 
countryside, the average amount of cultivated land per capita is 
0.1 hectare, which represents the lowest figure in the region. 
Meanwhile, the population density is 200 people per square 
kilometer, which represents the highest figure among 
agricultural countries. Peasants account for 80 percent of the 
population, engage chiefly in agricultural production, and 
receive only about 36 percent of GDP. One wage earner can 
support only three dependents. In many countries this figure is 
20 to 30, and in some countries even 60 or 80. As far as the 
countryside is concerned, about half of the work force is 
unemployed and 30 percent of rural families are poor. Worse 
still, most of those families are social welfare recipients 
based on the average per capita income earning rate of less than 
15 kilos of rice per month. In industry, labor productivity is 
only 30 percent of the international average, while material and 
fuel costs are 1.5 to two times greater. 
  Our latent natural resources are very great but our efforts 
to exploit them are poor. We have 1 million square km of 
continental shelf, which is three times larger than our inland 
area; a 3,200-km long coast with hundreds of islands, large and 
small; 12 million hectares of hills and mountains which are 
still uncultivated; many border areas; 160 rivers and canals 
leading to the sea; and a very large area which can be used for 
aquaculture. Most of these natural resources, however, remain in 
the form of latent potential. Of striking importance is the 
fact that we have an intellectual force of over 600,000 cadres 
with college and higher-education, 400,000 overseas Vietnamese 
intellectuals, and 5 million war veterans and retired cadres. 
The total capital of our people, both inside and outside the 
country, amounts to billions of U.S. dollars. Not much effort 
has been made to have them invest their money in production. 
Our capital, a huge asset indeed, is being worn out because of 
poor business management. 
  Generally speaking, the domestic market, including the labor 
market, has not been motivated and exploited satisfactorily. 
Information for the many "input- and output"-related services of 
various economic components is still very poor. That is why we 
have not been able to develop our potential to resolve the 
unemployment issue. 
  This situation has been ascribed to the fact that the 
starting point for our national development is too low: Our 
per-capita annual GNP is only around $200, thus ranking Vietnam 
156th among the 173 less developed countries. If based on the 
HDI (Human Development Index, including GNP, and the Cultural 
and Social Index), Vietnam may rank 115th among those countries. 
  The market economy has taken shape, bringing about tangible 
results. We are encountering difficulties, however, in changing 
our economic structure and restructuring economic management and 
the ownership of various economic components. Political 
indoctrination has not been closely linked with and has failed 
to serve as a driving force for economic renovation. Cultural 
development has also not been blended with economic renovation. 
Now there is a striking and essential requirement for being 
consistent in choosing targets and in assessing and using social 
driving force and the intellectual and material properties of 
the great national unity bloc for national development and 
renovation. We must link ourselves with it [the economic 
renovation task] and through this, develop to the fullest the 
strengths of science and technology and exploit our advantage as 
a practitioner who enjoys geographical, political, economic, and 
cultural, military, and historical advantages as a country in 
the Asia-Pacific region -- an area with the most dynamic 
potential for development in the 21st century. 
  We need to resolve these fundamental issues if we are to 
develop our capability to resolve unemployment more 
satisfactorily and rapidly. 
  A correct target chosen by our party and people is to 
realize 
the socialist ideal. To attain this goal, we need a long, 
multi-stage process. Therefore, it is important that we pay 
constant attention to our immediate goal of "building a 
peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous 
Vietnam" (President Ho Chi Minh's testament) and a prosperous 
people, powerful country, and equitable and civilized society, 
bearing in mind a consistent strategic slogan for various stages 
of development, that is, independence, freedom, and happiness. 
This slogan of Uncle Ho is inscribed in our national emblem) 
  Our methods to achieve these objectives are: to amass 
progressive wealth together, progressing from poverty to 
sufficiency, from humble wealth to greater riches, and to 
accumulate wealth in all material, intellectual, moral, 
personality, and emotional contexts. People who becomes wealthy 
earlier should help others who come later. All national 
development strategies should have as their main goals the 
liberalization of labor and production forces, and the use of 
cultural and socioeconomic efficiencies as criteria for their 
evaluation. All economic and political establishments, 
including those of the party, state, and mass organizations, 
should always strive to diligently do their utmost for national 
development, happiness, and the prosperous and glorious future 
of the nation. Henceforth, the party will never hold that it 
already knows everything, especially when it is a ruling party, 
but it will always value highly all initiatives from the great 
national unity bloc in constructing and implementing lines and 
policies to serve the people. That is also the guiding thought 
in preventing officialism, coercion, and corruption, and in 
implementing representative democracy through the National 
Assembly and direct democracy through the Fatherland Front and 
other mass organizations. Lack of democracy in combination with 
improper enforcement of discipline and laws will cause our 
ideals and objectives to become unclear, and damage the superior 
characteristics of our regime. 
  These directions, objectives, and methods are the foundation 
for determining concrete viewpoints and measures in planning and 
implementing processes to resolve the unemployment problem. 
  We need to confirm the view that the labor force needs to be 
liberalized, with legal guarantees for all citizens to be free 
to do business, to amass wealth lawfully, and employ workers in 
accordance with legal stipulations. We need to remove all 
prejudices, prohibitions, and hindrances to innovation and 
development of the citizens' business. We should quickly bring 
to fruition laws on domestic investment, protection of private 
ownership and intellectual property, and labor that oblige 
employers to maintain the welfare of workers and their families. 
  Creation of employment should be based on the development of 
a multi-sectoral merchandise economy with measures that are 
diversified, interrelated, cooperative, and competitive between 
themselves. We need to form a flexible labor market that 
responds well to supply and demand and that could develop 
opportunities to create employment in the healthy environment of 
new moral values and legal codes. 
  Job creation is the core of the issue of ensuring social 
security and equity during the development process, and is 
currently the top priority for avoiding a crisis situation. We 
will not be able to ensure social equity in our economic 
development if we keep the model of centralized, authoritarian 
socialism coupled with indiscriminate subsidization. Neither 
should we pursue economic development regardless of its damage 
to social equity, as proof of the chaos and degradation in many 
developing countries. 
  Our economy is developing from a weak starting point, with 
scant capital and low technology. But we have a strong labor 
force, so our strategy of job creation must include measures 
that aim to accelerate economic development while ensuring 
social equity. 
  Economic sectors and professions which require more labor 
and less capital such as agriculture, rural industry, light 
industry, small industry, and handicrafts, should be strongly 
developed to utilize our advantage of cheap labor and expand 
exports. Small family and partnership enterprises in cities and 
the countryside should be expanded. Traditional professions in 
different villages and city urbans should be restored. Centers 
for scientific production and research should be established 
near education centers, universities, high schools, and urban 
streets and villages to create a new image of linking education 
with practice, production, and research. We should pay more 
attention to the urbanization of the countryside and avoid the 
negative effects of concentrating development in big cities. 
Regarding industrialization and modernization, we must pay 
particular attention to rural industrialization as we are 
modernizing necessary industries such as telecommunications, 
informatics, biology, oil and gas, renewable energy, and 
materials .... 
  We must utilize technologies that require less capital and 
more labor. They do not have to be low technologies. In fact, 
they can be technologies of high intelligence when we introduce 
culture into development, when we know how to link intellectuals 
with workers and peasants in commodity production, and when we 
know how to adapt, improve, and traditionalize the modern 
science and technologies and modernize the traditional science 
and technologies. If we know how to encourage and utilize our 
abundant national contingent of intellectuals and our 
intelligent and industrious population with 85 percent literacy, 
we will able to shoulder this serious undertaking. The strategic 
direction to solve the unemployment problem lies in rural areas, 
coastal areas, the 1 million square km of continental shelves, 
and hilly and mountainous areas comprising three-fifths of our 
country and 12 million hectares of fallow land. 
  We should supplement and perfect our employment prospecta by 
providing adequate treatment to intellectuals and artists, 
retraining workers and managers, and upgrading economic sectors 
and professions to meet new requirements. We must perfect 
macroeconomic policies on taxation, land, natural resources, and 
credit to liberate and develop our potential labor force. We 
should introduce more policies to encourage citizens and 
organizations to create more jobs and satisfactorily implement 
the export of labor. We must consolidate and perfect our system 
of employment service, our centers for the application and 
transfer of technologies that provide more jobs, and the 
employment consultation offices. We must closely supervise our 
modest national employment fund to direct resources to 
localities and people with urgent needs for services. We must 
outline economic development plans to create more jobs 
practically and sufficiently. Then, we must quickly carry out 
the plans, avoiding the bureaucracy and formality which requires 
approval from different levels. We must stop allocating 
investment capital improperly. Investment capital should be 
quickly, fully, and directly allocated to create more jobs and 
develop the economy. In this area, we must strengthen control, 
quickly correct wrongdoings, and supplement and perfect the 
necessary tasks. 
  We should perfect our national employment program before 
introducing it to our annual planning in which directions for 
the creation of new regions, fields, industries, and professions 
must be outlined. Our investment should be concentrated on 
infrastructure to create favorable conditions and environment 
for citizens and political and socioeconomic organizations to 
create more jobs. We should pay more attention to the close 
combination of economy with national security and the economic, 
cultural, and social development of ethnic communities with 
programs for the cultural and social development of border areas 
and programs for the application and development of informatics, 
renewable energy, new materials, and biology. 
  Work represents the two sources, service and pleasure, of a 
citizen's happiness. Solving the employment problem is the 
responsibility of all people, the party, and the political 
system. It is also a central and urgent task of mass 
mobilization in national stabilization, renovation, 
construction, and protection.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 19 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States began an exploratory round of trade talks Thursday [19 
May] aimed at breaking a three-month deadlock on how to widen 
foreign access to the Japanese market and reducing Japan's vast 
trade surplus. 
  The meeting came amid fresh government data that showed the 
U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25.4 percent in March to 
5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. posted a record 59 billion 
dollar deficit with Japan last year. 
  Both Japanese and U.S. officials were cautious in predicting 
the outcome of the day's trade meeting at the Office of the U.S. 
Trade Representative. 
  "We will not know anything until we meet," said Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, Japan's vice trade minister for international affairs. 
  Okamatsu made the brief remark to reporters as he and 
Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, 
entered the office. 
  The Americans sounded equally cautious. 
  "We will have to wait and see what the Japanese officials 
bring," a senior U.S. official told reporters on condition of 
anonymity Wednesday. 
  At stake is the fate of the accord the two countries 
concluded in July last year to set up a new framework for 
bilateral trade designed to widen the access of foreign goods to 
Japan and reduce Japan's global trade surplus. 
  Negotiations on how to implement the terms of the framework 
agreement broke down in February when Japan refused to accept 
the U.S. definition on "objective criteria" for measuring 
Japanese imports. 
  The rupture of the trade negotiations, which came at the 
Feb. 
11 summit in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, shook financial markets and at 
one point sent the U.S. dollar close to a record low against 
the yen. 
  Clinton and other senior U.S. officials have since made what 
appeared to be conciliatory remarks on bilateral trade ties, but 
officials in Tokyo say they are uncertain about Washington's 
intentions. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters 
during a visit to Congress on Wednesday that the U.S. has not 
budged. 
  "Our position is exactly as it was in February. It has not 
changed at all," Kantor said. 
  Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Lawrence 
Summers, a member of the U.S. team involved in the trade talks 
with Japan, also insisted that the U.S. has not changed its 
position. 
  "I think (our) position has been consistent," Summers said 
in 
a separate meeting with reporters. 
  But Summers conceded that Washington will keep an eye on the 
shaky political situation in Tokyo when U.S. officials sit at 
the negotiating table with Japanese officials. 
  "Clearly, as we go forward in the negotiations, we have to 
recognize the political situation in Japan, and that obviously 
is one of the factors that goes into the strategy," he said. 
  While both Tokyo and Washington seem eager to get the 
framework talks back on track by the time Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata meets Clinton at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of 
industrialized nations in Italy in early July, U.S. officials 
say there is no deadline for a deal. 
  "We are not putting any artificial deadline on them. We 
think that would be a mistake," a senior U.S. trade official 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. expressed 
regret Thursday [19 May] at a U.S. International Trade 
Commission ruling that Japanese steelmakers are selling certain 
steel products in the U.S. market at unfairly low prices. 
  "It's regrettable that our argument was not understood, but 
this is the ITC's final ruling, so we'll consider what to do in 
the future by considering the implications of it," a Nippon 
Steel official said. 
  At stake in the ruling are two types of special steel -- 
grain- oriented steel and stainless angle used in heavy 
electrical machinery and the construction industry.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. and 
Kawasaki Steel Corp. may file an appeal with the U.S. Court of 
International Trade, complaining that they have caused no damage 
to the steel market in the United States, officials of the 
companies said Thursday [19 May]. 
  Such a move would be in response to a ruling by the U.S. 
International Trade Commission (ITC) that the Japanese 
steelmakers are selling certain steel products in the U.S. at 
unfairly low prices. 
  A Nippon Steel official said, "Our company has shipped only 
special steel which is not manufactured by U.S. makers. The 
ITC's final decision is beyond our understanding." 
  Kawasaki Steel said ITC's decision will damage U.S. 
companies 
which have steadily imported steel products from Japan. 
  The company commented that if such unreasonable antidumping 
actions are frequently taken, it will damage the mutual goal of 
maintaining long-term global stability in steel trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japanese banks have 
suspended handling remittances of dollars to North Korea 
following allegations that such money might have been used for 
development of nuclear weapons, banking sources said Thursday 
[19 May]. 
  The move follows a decision by a bank handling most of the 
money remitted to North Korea not to serve as an intermediary on 
behalf of other Japanese banks, the sources said. 
  Ashikaga Bank, a regional bank based in Tochigi Prefecture, 
has told other Japanese banks that it would not remit dollars to 
North Korea for them, the sources said. 
  Some of the Ashikaga Bank's customers are Korean residents 
of 
Japan who use the bank to remit money to North Korea as the bank 
is a main bank for a North Korean-born owner of a pachinko 
machine maker, the sources said. 
  Ashikaga Bank issued statements that the bank stopped 
intermediating with other banks in remitting dollars to North 
Korea some time ago, but is still handling such transactions by 
its own customers. 
  The bank also said it is not the sole bank in Japan that is 
handling money transactions to North Korea. 
  But a Finance Ministry official confirmed the suspension of 
dollar remittances to North Korea, describing it as a voluntary 
action. 
  "It's each bank's own decision to suspend remittance of 
dollars. Remittance of money in yen and (German) marks is still 
carried out as in the past, so I don't believe (banks) are 
discriminating against North Korea in money remittance," the 
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
  The United States has reportedly asked Japan to regulate 
remittance of money to North Korea as Pyongyang is suspected of 
using the money to promote its alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  It is not known how much money is actually remitted to North 
Korea from Japan, but trade and banking sources estimate the sum 
at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills. 
  Then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa pledged in February to 
take appropriate action if the UN Security Council adopts a 
resolution calling for economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  Asked at a news conference about the reported suspension of 
dollar remittances to North Korea from Japan, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said the government will look into the 
matter. He did not elaborate.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said Thursday [19 May] Japanese banks have 
suspended remittances of dollars to North Korea, but he denied 
suggestions the move was in response to pressure from the 
government. The government understands that the banks decided 
to suspend the remittances for operational reasons, he said. 
  The United States urged Japan last month to regulate the 
flow 
of hard currencies to North Korea, which is suspected of using 
the funds to promote a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
  It is not known how much money is remitted to North Korea 
from Japan, but trade and banking sources estimate the sum at 60 
billion yen a year, including trade bills. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito denied at a scheduled 
evening press meeting that his ministry gave any instructions to 
Ashikaga Bank to stop the remittances. 
  Asked if he has confirmed that with the bank, Saito said the 
ministry's Banking Bureau had no idea about it when he contacted 
the bureau, and added that he has not heard anything further.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan is strongly seeking 
North Korea's acceptance of full international inspections of 
its nuclear sites suspected of being used to produce nuclear 
weapons, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said Thursday. 
  "We think North Korea has yet to allay concerns that it is 
diverting its nuclear materials for military use," the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. "We therefore want 
North Korea to accept in earnest full nuclear inspections 
demanded by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)," he 
said. 
  The IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, 
has started monitoring the changing of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers 
north of the North Korean capital. But it is suspected that 
Pyongyang has already started the process of removing spent fuel 
rods from a nuclear reactor despite warnings that international 
monitors need to be present.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan's top nuclear policy 
board unveiled a plan Wednesday [18 May] to slow down remarkably 
its plutonium use for nuclear recycling, facing criticism from 
abroad and domestic circles that Tokyo may develop nuclear arms 
out of the substance. 
  The Atomic Energy Commission has worked on revising Japan's 
long- term nuclear energy policy, in which the country's 
plutonium use would be considerably delayed from the current 
program. 
  Aside from the criticism, the changes in the policy are 
being 
made as it has become less necessary for Japan to hastily make 
use of plutonium energy as prospects for future uranium supplies 
have brightened, officials said. 
  The committee headed by Science and Technology Agency chief 
Mikio Omi will draw up a final plan by the end of June, they 
said. 
  The new program requires Japan to reprocess spent nuclear 
fuel as the need arises so that excess plutonium would not be 
produced, and to store excess spent nuclear fuel for a long 
period, the officials said. 
  Under the current plan set in June 1987, spent nuclear fuel 
would be swiftly recycled into plutonium and be reused. 
  The new policy does not change the government's fundamental 
stance that it is indispensable for Japan to establish a nuclear 
energy recycling system as the country has only scarce energy 
resources, they said. 
  Another point of the plan, to recycle all of the country's 
spent nuclear fuel, is also kept intact, they said. 
  Japan will proceed with only limited nuclear recycling for 
the moment, however, including some recycling of plutonium in 
light water reactors, they said. 
  The country's long-term nuclear energy policy was drawn up 
for the first time in 1956 and is revised every five years by 
the committee. 
  The current program calls for Japan to put into operation a 
reprocessing plant in the village of Rokkasho, Aomori 
Prefecture, now under construction and expected to be completed 
by around 2010. 
  But the new policy cites that the scale and other plans on 
the plant will be decided by 2010, the officials said. 
  Japan's only reprocessing plant is being operated in 
Tokai-Mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, and the Rokkasho plant would be 
the second in operation. 
  The Tokai-Mura plant has had frequent problems and has not 
begun full operation. The delay in operation of the Rokkasho 
plant would leave Japan with large quantities of spent nuclear 
fuel. 
  But Japan will store the fuel until the country is able to 
recycle in the future, they said. 
  Japan will also back down from its current policy on 
development of fast breeder reactors, they said. The planned 
start of construction of a demonstration fast breeder reactor 
will be delayed from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, they 
said. 
  The launch of a commercial fast breeder reactor was not 
changed from the current target of around 2030. But fast 
breeder reactors will be consistent with light water reactors 
under the new plan, in comparison with the current policy in 
which they are placed as Japan's future main reactors, they said. 
  Also, Japan will not breed plutonium as long as fast breeder 
reactors are at the experimental level, the officials said. 
  Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju" reached 
criticality in April, the point at which the reactor's 
fissionable material is capable of sustaining a chain reaction 
at a constant level. 
  Monju, in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, can breed more 
plutonium 
than it consumes, causing several countries abroad to express 
concern that Japan may use the substance for future nuclear 
armament. 
  As a result of the changes in fast breeder reactor 
development, Japan's amounts of both supply and demand of 
plutonium by 2010 would be reduced to between 69 and 79 tons, 
the officials said. 
  The current plan said the amount of the supply would be 85 
tons and demand 80-90 tons.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan will have to transport 
plutonium by sea more than 100 times over the next decade under 
its plans to have its spent nuclear fuel recycled in Europe, a 
Tokyo- based antinuclear institute said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Jinzaburo Takagi, head of the Citizen's Nuclear Information 
Center, said, "ships loaded with radioactive substance will make 
the round trip between Europe and Japan in a period shorter than 
a month." 
  The frequent transportation would result in harsh criticism 
from countries along the ships' route, he said. 
  The Japanese freighter Akatsuki Maru carried plutonium from 
France back to Japan from November 1992 to January 1993, 
sparking widespread protests both at home and abroad. 
  Japan has signed contracts to have about 7,100 tons of spent 
nuclear fuel recycled into plutonium in Britain and France. 
  Under the center's calculation, 45 tons of plutonium will be 
produced from the spent fuel by around 2010. 
  Also, Japan will have to take back about 3,200 cylinders of 
vitrified high-level radioactive waste and 150,000 drums of low- 
level radioactive waste, that are produced in the recycling 
process, they said. 
  The 45 tons of plutonium must be transported by sea in 20 
shipments, high-level radioactive waste in 30-60 shipments and 
the low-level radioactive waste in 50-150 shipments, they said. 
  Takagi criticized the government for having made only 
limited 
preparations to accept the waste as it has decided merely to 
store 1,440 cylinders of vitrified waste at a reprocessing 
facility now under construction in the village of Rokkasho, 
Aomori Prefecture, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- A group of more than 500 
Japanese lawmakers urged the government of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Wednesday [18 May] to help protect the human 
rights of people in Myanmar [Burma] and establish civilian rule 
in the country. 
  House of Representatives member Shokei Arai told a news 
conference he visited Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai at 
the premier's official residence and handed him a copy of a 
petition signed by 508 Japanese legislators. 
  The letter calls for the "immediate and unconditional 
release" of Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and all 
political prisoners in Myanmar as well as a "swift and complete 
implementation of a transition to civilian rule." 
  While noting that Tokyo has been demanding the release of 
the 
Nobel Peace prize laureate, Kumagai reportedly vowed greater 
efforts to make Myanmar become a democratic nation. 
  Arai, a member of the new party Jiyuto (Liberals) headed by 
Foreign Minister Koji Kaikzawa, said he and his associates plan 
to send the petition to U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, if possible by late July, when Suu Kyi was 
originally expected to be released from house arrest. 
  It will be the second such letter by Japanese politicians to 
the U.N. chief, following one by 374 Diet members sent to 
Butrus-Ghali in March 1993. 
  Last April, 422 Diet members urged the government to put 
pressure on Myanmar to release Suu Kyi. 
  A founder of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which 
won the 1990 general election by a landslide, Suu Kyi has been 
under house arrest since July 1989. 
  She was expected to be freed July 19 this year from her 
five-year detention, the maximum period allowed under law. 
  But in February the ruling junta, which refused to hand over 
power five years ago, said it regards the first year of her 
detention as an "arrest period" and full detention was not 
imposed until July 1990. She is now expected to be freed in 
July 1995.

  [Text] Fukuoka, May 19 KYODO -- Police took a 27-year-old 
Japanese gangster into custody early Thursday [19 May] in 
connection with an alleged Chinese smuggling case in which 138 
Chinese suspects have been arrested on suspicion of illegally 
entering Japan. 
  Police officials identified the Yakuza as Ryuji Abiru, who 
was found with the 138 Chinese Wednesday in a warehouse at 
Hakata port in Fukuoka in Japan's southernmost main island of 
Kyushu. 
  The Chinese were apprehended along with Abiru, who was 
carrying a Japanese driver's license. 
  Fifteen of the 138 Chinese were women, police said. 
  Fukuoka prefectural police raided offices and other 
locations 
early Thursday to determine if the alleged smuggling case was 
part of a massive scheme to bring in Chinese and other 
foreigners for cheap labor. 
  Police raided the warehouse Wednesday after receiving a tip 
from a citizen who suspected there was a group of foreigners in 
the building. 
  Two temporary toilets had been built in the warehouse, which 
was leased to a man who reportedly described himself as an 
"importer." 
  One of the Chinese earlier said, "we have come to find jobs 
in Japan. We are victims."

  [Text] Fukuoka, May 18 KYODO -- Police arrested 75 out of 
the 139 people who were found at a warehouse in southern Japan 
on Wednesday [18 May] on suspicion of illegally entering Japan. 
The group included one Japanese and the rest appear to be all 
Chinese, police said. 
  Police found the group of 139 people, including 15 women, 
when about 100 officers raided the warehouse at Hakata port in 
Fukuoka after receiving a report from a citizen who suspected 
there was a group of foreigners in the building. 
  Two simple toilets had been built in the warehouse, which 
was 
leased to a man who reportedly described himself as an 
"importer." Answering a reporter's question in Chinese, one of 
the group said, "We have come to find jobs in Japan. We are 
victims." 
  Earlier in the day, police arrested a 20-year-old Chinese 
woman in the city on suspicion of having illegally entered 
Japan. Police searched around Hakata port after the woman said 
she has come to Japan with some 150 Chinese nationals. The 
woman, who did not carry a passport, said she left China at the 
end of April in a group of 150 Chinese. 
  A Chinese broker has told her that she could earn 300,000 
yen 
a month in Japan, she said. They twice changed ships at sea and 
were put on a Japanese fishing boat before arriving in Japan on 
Wednesday, according to her account. She said they missed the 
cars that were supposed to meet them, and did not know where 
they were.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Local assemblies across 
Japan have called on the government to assert Japanese 
sovereignty within the country's 200-nautical-mile territorial 
waters, fisheries organization officials said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Officials of the National Federation of Fisheries 
Cooperative 
Associations said that so far assemblies of 22 prefectures and 
274 cities, towns and villages have passed resolutions or issued 
statements to that effect since September. 
  They said that more assemblies are intending to move 
likewise 
to urge the government to put an end to poaching in territorial 
waters by fishermen from such countries as South Korea and China. 
  The officials said Japanese fishing communities are 
suffering 
greatly from losses of revenue due to the government's lax 
enforcement. 
  Japan declared a 200-nautical-mile exclusion zone in 1977, 
but does not apply it in the case of South Korea and China, with 
which it has territorial disputes. 
  South Korean and Chinese fishermen have taken advantage of 
this, trawling for crabs, squid and flatfish as close as 12 
nautical miles off the coast, they said. 
  They ignore regulations that Japanese fishermen must abide 
by 
and use methods that damage maritime resources, officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- A top business leader on 
Wednesday [18 May] welcomed the government's decision to shelve 
planned hikes in public service charges. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told reporters the decision 
will do good for the nation's economy. 
  On Tuesday, he urged Construction Minister Koji Morimoto to 
delay the planned rise in Japan's highway toll fares, saying 
public charge increase will trigger hikes in workers' wages and 
invite an upward spiral in both wages and prices. 
  Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata instructed 
his 
aides to halt "until the end of year" planned hikes in the rate 
of domestic telephone charges and in rent for public housing, as 
well as taxi fares and highway tolls. 
  Local governments are to be asked to refrain from raising 
fees for buses and subways. 
  Nagano said, "I am surprised and glad that the government 
halted raises in not only highway tolls but also other public 
charges." 
  He was calling for the freeze to last for two years, "but I 
won't complain that the suspension is until the end of year," 
Nagano said. 
  He said he is still willing to testify at a public hearing 
over the proposed rise of an average 10.4 percent in highway 
tolls if it is held on next Tuesday as scheduled.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
moved to rally public support for his precarious minority 
government Wednesday [18 May] by announcing a freeze on planned 
hikes in public service charges. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai announced at a press 
conference a sweeping freeze until the year-end of raises in 
public charges, including domestic telephone charges, public 
housing rent, taxi fares and tolls for the nation's expressways. 
  It was the first such wide-ranging freeze on public charge 
hikes since 1964, when the government was combating strong 
inflationary pressure. 
  The announcement was made amid an increasingly vocal 
broadside from the public and business to the planned hikes. 
  On Tuesday, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), urged Construction Minister 
Koji Morimoto to freeze the planned raise in tolls for the 
nation's highways for two years. 
  The leading business mogul excoriated the government over 
the 
plan, arguing a hike in the tolls would put a big damper on the 
nation's flagging economy. 
  The move was prompted by concerns in the government that the 
planned series of public charge raises could cast a pall over 
the nascent recovery of the economy as well as by public 
criticism, government sources said. 
  It is also Hata's apparent bid to rally public support for 
his government in the face of the opposition's relentless attack 
on his shaky political standing, analysts said. 
  Kumagai made clear at the press conference it was a 
"political decision" by Hata. 
  He said the premier, "with reckless valor," made the 
decision 
after taking into consideration "the criticism from every 
corner" of the proposed hikes. 
  "The people are displeased with the planned charge hikes," 
Kumagai said, adding, "we have to respond to the people's 
voices." 
  He said the government will also ask local authorities to 
follow the government's example and not raise public-sector bus 
and subway fares. 
  Asked about the decision, to be endorsed at a cabinet 
meeting 
Friday, Hata said it is the government's response to the 
criticism that it is too willing to raise charges for its 
services while the private sector is going through a tough 
restructuring to tide over the slump. 
  Hata also hinted the move is designed to sweeten the 
government's proposed tax reform, which is expected to include a 
hike in the consumption tax. 
  "Well, we will have to obtain support for the tax reform and 
some other things," he said. 
  Political pundits were skeptical of the move, calling it a 
claptrap. 
  "It is a stopgap effort to gain popularity. (Hata) is simply 
pulling the wool over the people's eyes," said Makoto Sataka, a 
social commentator. 
  Hata heads the first minority government in four decades. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest bloc in the 
opposition camp, has signaled it will submit a motion of no- 
confidence in the government after the overdue state budget for 
fiscal 1994 passes the Diet. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest 
opposition group and a partner in the ruling coalition of Hata's 
predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, has also called for an early 
general election for the House of Representatives. 
  The move is also aimed at selling Hata's "strong leadership" 
and his compassion for people's hardships as a snap election 
grows more likely, analysts said. 
  Business and consumer groups, however, mostly welcomed the 
decision. 
  Nikkeiren's Nagano said at a press conference it will 
benefit 
the Japanese economy. "I am happy to hear the news. It is good 
for the economy," he said. 
  A senior executive of a major chemical company said, "I 
really appreciate Mr. Hata's decision." 
  Some companies and government ministries, however, were 
perplexed by the sudden decision to freeze the public charges. 
  An official of the Transport Ministry, which supervises the 
taxi industry, said, "it was a bolt out of the blue. I cannot 
comment until we receive an official notice." 
  A taxi company executive said, "we will be in trouble if the 
taxi fare hike is not permitted. But...we cannot revolt against 
the order." 
  Kosaku Yamada, who heads Japan Highway Public Corp., which 
has planned an average 10.6 percent hike in highway tolls, said, 
"we can do nothing but to accept the government decision." 
  Nonlife insurance companies were also rocked by the freeze, 
which covers fire insurance premiums. 
  "I was really surprised by the sudden announcement," said 
Takashi Onoda, head of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association 
of Japan. 
  Some government economists voiced skepticism over the move. 
  "It is a political decision by the cabinet. If the hikes are 
postponed the margin of raises may have to be larger later," 
said Koichi Tani of the Economic Planning Agency. 
  "(The decision) is undesirable from an economic policy point 
of view. The planned hikes would not have put a major drag on 
consumption." 
  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the No. 1 opposition 
party, also took a dim view of the move. 
  "It is a mere postponement. The hikes in the next year may 
be larger than planned," said Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the 
LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. It should be called 
"claptrap," Hashimoto said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Wednesday [18 May] instructed his aides to freeze the hikes 
in public service charges until the end of the year, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  The planned move is intended to stem the rate increases in 
domestic telephone charges, the rent for public housing, taxi 
fares, tolls for the nation's expressways and fire insurance 
premiums, the top government spokesman told a news conference. 
  The government will also ask local autonomies to refrain 
from 
raising fees charged for their bus and subway services, Kumagai 
said. 
  The premier ordered Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency 
Director General Yoshio Terasawa on Tuesday to move quickly to 
carry out the measure. 
  The cabinet will approve the scheme at its regular meeting 
on 
Friday, according to Kumagai.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The chairman of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) on Thursday [19 
May] urged telecommunications, taxi and other public service 
operators to make stepped-up cost-cutting efforts to prevent a 
hike in their charges. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of Japan's top business lobby, told 
reporters the government's decision to freeze hikes in public 
service charges until the end of the year is laudable but added 
further cost-cutting efforts are needed to forestall future 
hikes. 
  The government said Wednesday it will suspend until the end 
of this year a plan to raise public service charges, including 
public transportation fees, highway tolls and telephone rates.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Hideaki Kumano, vice 
minister of international trade and industry, said Thursday [19 
May] the government's decision to freeze hikes on public service 
fees is "appropriate." 
  The decision was made taking into account various factors 
facing the private sector, including business restructuring 
efforts, Kumano told a news conference. 
  Implementation of the rate hikes at a time when the economy 
is still in a slump would affect industrial activity in Japan, 
Kumano said. 
  The government announced Wednesday it will suspend until the 
end of this year a plan to raise public services charges, 
including public transportation fees, highway tolls, telephone 
rates and rent on government-owned houses. 
  Meanwhile, Kumano voiced regret over gasoline sales by an 
unlicensed gas station near Nagoya in defiance of government 
instructions. The gas station should get a government permit at 
an early time by agreeing to undergo proper procedures, Kumano 
said. 
  The gas station in question on Wednesday began selling 
gasoline at prices very low for Japan, and motorists flocked to 
fill up. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry did 
not issue a business license for the station because it did not 
clarify the wholesale routes of its products, one requirement 
for operating a gas station. A government advisory panel is now 
studying whether or not the requirement should be scrapped as 
part of deregulation, Kumano said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Leading Japanese newspapers 
in their editorials Thursday [19 May] supported Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's freezing of the planned hikes in public service 
charges until the end of the year. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
called the government 's decision "a natural measure." The 
business daily said it welcomes the decision because "raising 
public service charges has the same effect as raising taxes, and 
the government is facing a necessity to reduce taxes to promote 
consumption and get over the recession." It also said the 
recent rush of planned hikes in public service rates seems to 
have been done easily without satisfactory explanation, taking 
advantage of the disorder in the government to hoodwink the 
public. It called on public utilities to take rationalization 
measures as private companies do, and to disclose their business 
structures and try to obtain public understanding when they plan 
to increase charges. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN also said the decision to shelve the 
planned increase in public service charges is natural, although 
it was abrupt. The ASAHI said the decision came late because 
postal charges and the tolls for Tokyo expressways have already 
been increased, but said it supports the decision. It urged 
public service companies to work on a drastic restructuring 
during the time the freeze is in effect. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN said it understands the decision by 
Hata 
although his aim is not so clear, and said not many citizens 
object to it. But the MAINICHI warned Hata that consumers will 
be very angry if public service charges are raised by a margin 
higher than the current increase plans after the freeze ends.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- An abrupt government 
decision Wednesday [18 May] to freeze hikes of public service 
charges until the year-end came as a surprise to Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and other enterprises 
concerned, industry sources said. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata ordered the freeze and the 
government will ask local authorities to follow suit, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  NTT, which plans to raise basic telephone charges by an 
average 18 percent, said the company will follow decisions by 
public hearings and an advisory panel at the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry. 
  Company officials, however, said they were upset by the 
government's decision, which will have an impact on the 
company's business performance. 
  The nonlife insurance industry also said it was surprised by 
the decision. Takashi Onoda, head of the Marine and Fire 
Insurance Association of Japan, told reporters the industry was 
considerably upset by it. 
  The decision came as nonlife insurers applied to the Finance 
Ministry for approval of their plans to raise fire insurance 
rates, effective July 1. 
  Major nonlife insurance companies said they did not know 
immediately what impact the decision would have on their 
business. 
  Kohei Abe, president of the Federation of Electric Power 
Companies, said member companies will decide whether to revise 
utility charges at their own discretion. 
  The power companies will keep lower rates until September to 
return foreign exchange gains to consumers.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Wednesday [18 May] urged parliamentary cooperation in 
speeding up the process of enacting an electorate redistricting 
bill so that an upcoming general election could be contested 
under the single-seat constituency system. 
  "Although I can invoke my authority to call a general 
election even under the current multiseat constituency system 
still in place, it is desirable for the election to be contested 
under the new system," Hata said. 
  Hata made the remark in a question-and-answer session in the 
House of Representatives Budget Committee. 
  Although the Diet legislated in January a package of 
electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system 
for the 511-member lower chamber with a mix of single-seat 
electorates and proportional representation, it requires the 
passage of the demarcation bill to allow the next election to be 
lawfully contested under the single-seat system. 
  At present, a government-appointed panel of experts are 
speeding up the task of splitting the nation's multiseat 
constituencies into 300 single-seat electorates. 
  Hata said, "I am aware that some citizens are demanding an 
early holding of the election to seek a public verdict on 
politicians in view of the fact that my new administration has 
been reduced to a minority government." 
  However, Hata said the legislation of the redistricting bill 
must precede the general election, saying, "it is crucial to 
firmly establish the (single-seat) system." 
  "The public feels that politics is in a hopeless situation 
and their feelings have caused low voter turnout ratios in 
various elections," he said. 
  On North Korea's alleged nuclear development program, Hata 
said Japan is trying to make contacts with Pyongyang through the 
Japanese Embassy in China to convey the international 
community's stance on the issue. 
  He said that if North Korea really opens itself to the 
world, 
the United States, South Korea, China and Japan can help it 
"develop its people's livelihood." Japan is ready to talk with 
North Korea "if talks are necessary," Hata said. 
  On the idea of "universal security" incorporated in policy 
accords among the ruling coalition parties, Hata said the idea 
is "very similar" to the collective security spelled out in the 
U.N. Charter. 
  Last Thursday, Hata told a House of Representatives plenary 
session that the Constitution prohibits Japan's involvement in 
collective defense, in answer to concerns that his government 
may move toward active military actions overseas. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa addressed the committee and 
appeared to retract his earlier statements referring to 
reconsidering the interpretation of the war-renouncing 
Constitution by postwar governments that it bars participation 
in collective defense. 
  Kakizawa said he expected "wide-range discussion on what 
national security should be" and he would apologize and withdraw 
the remarks if the statements caused misunderstanding. 
  On another remark of his calling for early steps toward 
legislation for dealing with international crises, Kakizawa said 
he was referring to a possible emergency situation related to 
North Korea's suspected nuclear development project. 
  Kakizawa said he was not referring to "emergency 
legislation" 
that was once discussed to deal with a possible invasion of 
Japan.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2239 GMT on 14 May, in its "News 2001" program, 
carries a 30-minute interview with Masayoshi Takemura, head of 
Sakigake, by FNN announcer Yuji Kuroiwa and Megumi Sekito, 
attended by writer Yoshimi Ishikawa, political commentator 
Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki 
Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo. 
  Asked to clarify Sakigake's political stand, Masayoshi 
Takemura (hereinafter Takemura) says: "As I said during my Diet 
speech, we have responsibilities to fulfill because we worked 
with the Hosokawa administration in preparing the budget and 
enacting the laws. Therefore, we will act as a ruling party and 
cooperate with them as far as the budget and the laws are 
concerned, at least during the current Diet session." He adds: 
"However, as far as the Hata administration's new policies are 
concerned, we will carefully study them and make a decision as 
to whether or not we will support them. We will act as a 
wholesome opposition party close to the ruling parties. You can 
say we are an opposition party because we will be assuming a 
stand opposing the government in some cases and supporting it in 
others, depending on the issue at hand. We will act in 
conjunction with the ruling parties during the current Diet 
session and become a wholesome opposition party after that." 
  On the possibility of summoning former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to the Diet to testify on the issue of his loan from 
Sagawa Kyubin, Takemura says that it may be inevitable. At the 
same time, Takemura also says that as a member of the former 
Hosokawa administration, he hopes that Diet testimony will be 
avoided. 
  Asked how Sakigake will respond if the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) brings up a no-confidence motion in the Diet, 
Takemura answers: "We still have not thought that far ahead." 
He says his party will not be interested in a no-confidence 
motion until the budget and the bills are approved." 
  On the issue of general elections, Takemura says: "We should 
complete the redrawing of electoral districts as soon as 
possible. I think the Diet should be dissolved after we form a 
new election system." 
  Turning to the issue of tax reform, Kuroiwa asks Takemura if 
his party is against the idea of increasing indirect taxes. In 
response, Takemura explains the need promote tax reform to cope 
with an aging society. 
  Kuroiwa then asks whether Sakigake attaches importance to 
relations with the United States. Takemura answers: "Of course 
we attach importance to relations with the United States. We 
cannot destroy the framework of our political and economic ties 
and military alliance with the United States." 
  Asked whether Sakigake thinks Japan should cooperate with 
the 
United States in imposing sanctions against North Korea without 
waiting for a UN decision, Takemura says that it is not a good 
idea to talk about this issue on the basis of assumptions. He 
continues to say: "Frankly speaking, I think that without China, 
our diplomatic or military policies toward the DPRK will have no 
effect." 
  Asked if Sakigake will form close ties with the LDP, 
Takemura 
says that his party will seek cooperation with the LDP in wide- 
ranging areas. He also says: "Our understanding is that the 
reorganization of the political world will be realized by 
involving the DLP."

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network 
in Japanese at 1145 GMT on 8 May carries, during its weekly 
"Sunday Project" program, a 20-minute live interview with 
Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan (SDPJ), by freelance commentator Soichiro Tahara. 
Murayama is at the "ABC Studio" in Osaka. "Insider" magazine 
chief editor Hajime Takano and Kyoto University Professor 
Masaaki Kosaka also interview Murayama. 
  At 1145 GMT, Tahara asks Murayama about Justice Minister 
Nagano's resignation over his remarks on the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre. Murayama says: "This is a matter of course." He 
adds: "We cannot say the prime minister has no responsibility 
for the confusion caused by Nagano's remarks. In that sense, we 
would like to ask the prime minister about his stance on the 
issue." Asked about cooperation with Hata's coalition 
government, Murayama says he has the impression that the Hata 
administration is taking a different view from the Hosokawa 
administration, noting recent remarks by ministers of the Hata 
cabinet. He says: "If the Hata administration promotes the 
reform line which it took over from the Hosokawa administration, 
we will cooperate with them on some issues. However, if the 
nature of the administration changes, then our position may be 
different." Asked about SDPJ's stance as an opposition party, 
Murayama says his party needs to take the initiative in 
developing the political situation and promoting reforms to meet 
public expectations. 
  Tahara asks whether the SDPJ will be bound in the future by 
agreements reached among the previous coalition parties on the 
eve of the formation of the Hata cabinet. Murayama replies: 
"We should fulfill our engagements with the people. However, 
since these agreements were reached during the tenure of the 
coalition administration, we will not be bound by them regarding 
our former position as a ruling coalition party. From this 
viewpoint, the SDPJ will take its own stance on the issue." 
Discussing the tax issue, Murayama says that the consumption 
tax should be abolished and the issue of indirect taxes should 
be newly discussed in the process of tax reform. 
  At 1157 GMT, Takano asks Murayama about cooperation with the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In reply, Murayama says: "At 
the present, we have no ideas regarding the formation of an 
LDP-SDPJ alliance." He also rules out the possibility of the 
SDPJ returning to the coalition at present. Tahara asks: "With 
what kind of LDP can the SDPJ cooperate?" Murayama replies: 
"The LDP needs to sweep away its corrupt structure; to cut off 
the comfortable ties existing between politicians, bureaucrats, 
and businessmen; and to pursue politics in a democratic manner 
from now on." He also notes the need for discussions with the 
LDP regarding its views on the Constitution and what the state 
ought to be like. 
  Asked about the next general election, Murayama says: "I 
think the next election should be held under the new election 
system. However, if the administration's policies come to a 
deadlock and there is no choice but to dissolve the House of 
Representatives, elections under the current system will be 
inevitable." He says: "Because the draft budget was drawn up 
with our cooperation, we will cooperate with the coalition in 
passing the budget through the Diet. However, we will form free 
and unbiased policies on other issues." 
  At 1203 GMT, Kosaka asks for Murayama's opinion on what the 
latter believes the important issues in reform are. In addition 
to political reform, Murayama cites measures to prevent 
political corruption and the reform of Diet functions. Takano 
questions the Hata administration on its stance regarding the 
right to collective self-defense. Murayama says: "We would 
like to firmly question the Hata administration on its stance 
regarding this issue and the Constitution at an interpellation 
at the Diet session." Tahara asks Murayama: "What do you think 
of the remarks by Foreign Minister Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Kumagai that an appropriate legislative measure should 
be taken in connection with North Korea's (DPRK) suspected 
nuclear weapons development?" In reply, Murayama stresses that 
it is inappropriate to create a situation in which North Korea 
is forced into isolation from the international community. He 
adds: "All countries concerned need to help persuade North 
Korea on the nuclear issue. It is important for concerned 
countries to make efforts to see to it that dialogue between 
North Korea and the United States is smoothly put back on the 
right track. I think the Japanese Government should stick to its 
stance of seeking a solution through dialogue." 
  Finally, Tahara asks Murayama whether the SDPJ intends to 
form a parliamentary group to confront the group "Kaishin," 
which has led to the SDPJ's secession from the coalition. 
Murayama replies: "We have no such idea at present. However, 
we would like to closely cooperate with Sakigake and other 
forces which hold views similar to our own."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP), 
headed by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and its tiny 
social democratic ally have agreed to merge to promote 
realignment in the nation's political arena, the two parties 
said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Hosokawa and Satsuki Eda, who heads the United Social 
Democratic Party (USDP), agreed that the JNP will absorb the 
17-year-old party and announce a joint statement Sunday. 
  The statement will proclaim the two parties' determination 
to 
promote further political realignment and declare a clear 
apology for Japan's behavior during World War II. 
  The two parties decided on the merger because of the 
closeness of their reform-oriented political tenets, officials 
said. 
  Both parties attach importance to decentralization of power 
and to more active civil involvement in the political process, 
they said. 
  Two of the three USDP members in the House of 
Representatives, Eda and Shogo Abe, will join the new party, 
boosting the JNP's strength in the lower house to 39, compared 
with 206 for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 74 for the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), 62 for Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] and 52 for Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  But the third USDP legislator, Yanosuke Narazaki, will 
become 
an independent. 
  The new JNP will raise the banner of "practical idealism" 
after the merger, they said. 
  The move, however, is unlikely to help consolidate the JNP's 
footing, which is becoming more shaky every day, political 
analysts said. 
  The JNP, which is rapidly losing public support, is in a 
crisis of splitting as Hosokawa's leadership has been incurably 
damaged by his resignation from the premiership over his shady 
financial dealings in the 1980s. 
  Rank-and-file party members are increasingly disgruntled 
about the political strategy and handling of Diet business by 
the top brass, insiders said. 
  Three members left the party in April to form a new 
parliamentary group, Seiun, after Hosokawa reneged on a promise 
to merge with new party Sakigake [Harbinger], headed by former 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Seiun's three members and Sakigake's 15 members have formed 
a 
joint parliamentary group in the lower house. 
  One focal point is the issue of dissolving the parliamentary 
bloc Kaishin, created by some coalition partners after Tsutomu 
Hata was elected to succeed Hosokawa. 
  The formation of Kaishin infuriated the (SDP) [parentheses 
as 
received], which was the largest bloc in the ruling coalition 
that supported the Hosokawa administration. 
  The SDP walked out of the coalition, leaving Hata with a 
minority government. 
  Hosokawa on Wednesday supported the idea of scrapping 
Kaishin, joining the growing camp in the coalition that calls 
for dissolving the Diet club to lure back the SDP into the 
coalition. 
  But chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa of the 
coalition's core party Shinseito has expressed strong opposition 
to such a move. 
  The issue engendered a bitter controversy in the JNP over 
its 
political strategy as a growing number of party members are 
critical about Hosokawa's decision to join Kaishin. 
  The members of Seiun are making overtures to JNP lawmakers 
to 
leave the party and join their group, and some analysts believe 
the JNP is on the verge of a major split. 
  "The JNP's split is now a matter of time," said one SDP 
legislator.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that the idea of 
universal security [fuhenteki anzenhosho], which is included in 
the previous ruling coalition parties' policy agreement, is 
generally similar to the collective security [shudanteki 
anzenhosho] policy stated in the United Nations Charter. He 
said this during a session of the Lower House Budget Committee. 
  Hidenao Nakagawa, member of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic 
Party [LDP], raised this issue during the session. He asked 
Prime Minister Hata to state the similarities and differences 
between the policy agreement's idea of universal security and 
the collective security plans stipulated in the UN Charter, 
which include provisions for military sanctions. The prime 
minister replied that the two are generally similar. Nakagawa 
was not convinced and asked the government to indicate its 
position in detail. 
  The collective security policy stipulated in the UN Charter 
includes provisions for economic and military sanctions. 
However, the United Nations has never used troops to implement 
military sanctions. So the Japanese Government has not yet 
indicated its opinion as to whether the Japanese Constitution 
allows Japan to take part in such UN sanctions. Therefore, 
Prime Minister Hata's remarks today are expected to stir 
controversy. 
  Nakagawa also referred to remarks made earlier by Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa. He asked the foreign minister if he 
intends to review the government's interpretation of the 
Constitution that the collective defense is banned by the 
Constitution. The foreign minister replied that he has his own 
opinion, but as a member of the cabinet, he will support the 
Hata cabinet's policy to maintain the position of the previous 
government. He said that he would take back his previous 
remarks if they are taken to mean that the government should 
review its interpretation of the Constitution because that is 
not what he meant. 
  Since a budget draft had been sent to the Upper House, the 
Upper House Budget Committee held an executive council meeting 
this evening to discuss the schedule for deliberating a draft 
supplementary budget. However, the council failed to reach a 
conclusion. The council will meet again tomorrow.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0000 GMT on 15 May broadcasts a live, 60-minute 
roundtable discussion: "Rights and Wrongs of Tax Increases and 
Reductions." Roundtable participants include Hirohisa Fujii, 
finance minister; Kozo Watanabe; acting chief secretary of 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party); Ryutaro Hashimoto, policy 
research council chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); 
Koken Nosaka, Diet administration committee chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ); and Iwao Nakatani, 
professor at Hitotsubashi University. The program is moderated 
by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto. 
  The discussion begins with Yamamoto asking Finance Minister 
Fujii whether Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was referring to a 
consumption tax hike when he recently said that the government 
would create a balanced tax system by reviewing income and 
consumption taxes. After noting that various measures have been 
discussed to promote tax reform, Fujii says: "His remarks meant 
that the government will rectify overly heavy reliance on income 
taxes." He admits that it also means the review of the ratios 
of direct and indirect taxation. Concerning the government's 
attempt to draft a concrete tax reform plan during June, 
Shinseito's Watanabe notes that there are strong hopes for 
compiling the plan on schedule, while the SDPJ's Nosaka predicts 
that it will be difficult for the government to draft such plans 
by the end of June. The LDP's Hashimoto says the government has 
not exerted efforts to gain public understanding on the planned 
tax reform. When asked why the government should set a deadline 
for formulating concrete reform plans, Fujii stresses that the 
tax reform is being studied as a measure not to implement tax 
cuts but to cope with the graying of society. He says: "Our 
goal is to draft concrete plans by the end of June, or if this 
is impossible, by the end of the year." Professor Nakatani, 
however, expresses doubts about the effectiveness of a 
government plan to implement a tax hike and reduction at the 
same time, and about the necessity of hastily formulating the 
tax reform plan in time for a Japan-U.S. summit meeting and the 
Naples summit in July. In this connection, Fujii notes the need 
for the government to secure financial sources to fund tax cuts, 
suggesting the simultaneous implementation of a tax hike and 
reduction. He adds: "The government is considering 
implementing multi-year -- not single-year -- tax cuts and 
taking necessary measures to carry out the cuts." 
  Hashimoto criticizes the government for examining only tax 
reform as a means to cope with the aging of society, saying that 
the government must view the nation's burden in terms of taxes 
and social security premiums as a whole. He also chides the 
government for having raised fees on many public utilities, 
claiming the increased fees will reduce the effects of tax cuts 
on the economy. 
  Nosaka stresses that the government should promote tax 
reform 
after gaining the people's understanding. Commenting on this, 
Fujii promises utmost efforts to gain public understanding, 
saying: "Reform will not be implemented without the support of 
the general public -- in particular, without the support of Diet 
members of each political party." Also, referring to 
Hashimoto's call for reviewing not only the tax burden but also 
the burden of social security premiums, Fujii says that while 
taking this into consideration, the government will make efforts 
to gain the understanding of the people. The roundtable 
participants then discuss what the government should do to gain 
popular understanding. Hashimoto asks the government to take 
enough time to listen to the opinions of the people. Fujii 
agrees with him, saying it is a matter of course for the 
government to hear public opinions. Asked about whether the 
ruling coalition will seek out the opinions of opposition 
parties in the process of formulating the tax reform plan, 
Shinseito's Watanabe says: "We will naturally do so. The plan 
will amount to nothing if it is scrapped in the Diet." 
  Explaining the SDPJ's position on tax reform, Nosaka says: 
"We think that it is inevitable for the government to first 
consider increasing the ratio of indirect taxation and 
establishing a new tax to finance income tax cuts." 
  In answering a question on whether the ruling coalition 
plans 
to specify the size and timing of a tax increase in its tax 
reform plan, Watanabe notes the need for the coalition to seek 
the support of the LDP and the SDPJ, again saying the plan will 
amount to nothing unless it is adopted in the Diet. 
  Turning to administrative reform, Nosaka says that although 
the government is calling on the private sector to promote 
restructuring, it has to restructure itself as well. Asked if 
the government can compile effective deregulation measures for 
administrative reform by the end of June, Fujii, while stressing 
the importance of administrative reform, says: "Deregulation is 
very important from an international point of view and in light 
of the need to transform Japan's economic structure. The 
government is dealing with deregulation with these points in 
mind." However, Professor Nakatani questions the effectiveness 
of deregulation measures currently being studied by the 
government, saying that with these measures, the government will 
not be able to open Japanese markets wider and promote 
deregulation fully enough to satisfy the people and other 
countries. He points out that if the government can lessen the 
differences between domestic and overseas prices by promoting 
deregulation, domestic demand will increase greatly. Fujii 
agrees with Nakatani, saying that what the latter said is very 
important. Meanwhile, noting areas in which he believes the 
government should promote deregulation, Hashimoto urges a review 
of the country's systems of standardization and validation, 
referred to as non-tariff barriers by other countries, to meet 
the expectations of the United States and other nations. He 
also stresses: "To promote deregulation, it is necessary to 
strengthen the power of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC). 
Otherwise, the FTC will not be able to cope with such unfair 
business practices as dumping." The SDPJ's Nosaka also stresses 
the importance of deregulation, saying: "While taking into 
account Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States, the 
government should promote regulation in such a way that it 
abolishes unnecessary regulations and maintains necessary ones."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The Natural Resources and 
Energy Agency will pursue a policy aimed at limiting the annual 
growth of energy consumption at around 1 percent by 2010, a 
senior agency official said Thursday [19 May]. 
  The policy is designed to promote energy conservation in the 
context of preserving the global environment, the official said 
on condition of anonymity. The agency is part of the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry. 
  The official said the policy will be clarified in an interim 
report forecasting Japan's long-term energy supply and demand. 
It will be released by the advisory committee for energy in May 
or June. The panel advises the trade minister. 
  Energy conservation in the new policy will focus on 
consumption by households and transportation sectors, the 
official said. 
  New sources of energy also should be used to improve energy 
saving, including solar power, recycled use of waste materials 
and cogeneration systems. The official said the "summer time" 
daylight saving system should be introduced in Japan. 
  He said Japan's energy consumption would grow at an annual 
rate of around 1.5 percent toward 2010 if the current energy 
policy is maintained. 
  On the bargain sale of gasoline by an unlicensed gas station 
near Nagoya, the agency official said it is "timely" to discuss 
the validity of a law governing the operation of gas stations. 
  The gas station was not granted a business license by MITI 
because it did not clarify the wholesale sources of its 
products, a requirement for running a gas station in Japan. 
  The station, however, began selling gasoline in defiance of 
MITI's instructions. 
  Under the existing system, to get a license a retailer must 
adhere to the requirement, introduced as a way of securing a 
stable supply of products, the official said. 
  The official said he understands the regulation is intended 
to prevent excessive price-cutting competition among gas 
stations. 
  But he added there appears to be room to discuss the 
validity 
of maintaining the regulation.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan's petrochemical 
industry should do more to cut costs in order to maintain price 
competitiveness against imports, a government advisory panel 
said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Japanese petrochemical companies are performing well in 
their 
competition with foreign products with the import ratio staying 
at a low 9.0 percent in fiscal 1993, the Petrochemical Supply 
and Demand Coordination Council, an advisory body to the trade 
minister, said in a report. 
  The council said this reflects better services provided by 
the domestic industry in nonprice fronts, such as better quality 
products, well-organized after-sales services and better 
distribution-related services. 
  But it added maintenance of such services, often made at the 
expense of a product price increase, has put a heavy financial 
burden on Japanese petrochemical firms, making their business 
operations less profitable. 
  In order to keep price competitiveness while providing the 
same services, the industry needs to curtail costs in 
production, sales, and research and development, the council 
said. 
  The task, however, is impossible unless the Japanese 
petrochemical industry goes through comprehensive structural 
reforms, including formation of joint sales and manufacturing 
companies and the industry's overall reorganization through 
mergers and acquisitions, for efficient business operations, it 
said. 
  The report calls for a drastic review of Japanese 
petrochemical firms' export strategy in which they tend to offer 
products at bargain prices abroad simply to maintain factory 
utilization rates.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Parliamentary vice ministers 
called unanimously Thursday [19 May] for further restructuring 
and cost-cutting efforts by the government, a government 
spokesman said. 
  The vice ministers said in their meeting that the government 
should share the pain with the private sector, Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura told a press conference. They 
were apparently endorsing a government decision Wednesday to 
suspend planned hikes in public service charges. 
  The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata announced 
Wednesday it will suspend until the end of the year planned 
increases in public service charges, including highway tolls, 
telephone rates and public transportation fares. Kitamura said 
the vice ministers praised Hata's decision as "wise." 
  The spokesman said they agreed to ask their ministries to 
make further cost-cutting efforts, including scrapping and 
integration of government organs, a cut in personnel costs and 
streamlining of government-affiliated bodies. 
  Meanwhile, government sources said local bus services may be 
excluded from the planned rate freeze. Suspension of a 
requested fare hike of 10 percent could cause bankruptcy for 
some local bus companies, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan's trade ministry 
Thursday [19 May] unveiled a program to build a society that is 
highly information-oriented toward the next century. 
  The program emphasized the need for the government to 
augment 
ongoing efforts in the private sector for realizing such a 
society, in particular through integrated networking of computer 
and telecommunications systems. 
  Specifically, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) called for promotion of such networking in five 
sectors -- education, research, medical and welfare services, 
administrative operations and public libraries. 
  The task, however, will be impossible to achieve unless the 
government makes efforts to improve business, technical and 
social conditions in these areas, the program said. 
  It said the conditions include computer standardization, 
establishing security systems in computer-related business, 
protection of intellectual property rights, deregulation of 
various rules and upgrading telecom-related infrastructure, the 
program said. 
  MITI said the program was formulated to give concrete shape 
to policy measures recommended last June by the Industrial 
Structure Council, an advisory body to the trade minister. 
  In the past year, a drive to build information-oriented 
societies has been accelerated on a global basis, including the 
national information infrastructure scheme proposed by the 
United States and the trans-European network program by Europe.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Hino Motors Ltd., a leading 
Japanese truck maker, has developed the world's most efficient 
large-scale diesel engine, a Japanese industrial daily reported 
Thursday [19 May]. 
  The turbocharged, 10000-cc engine is 10 percent more fuel 
efficient than similar large-scale diesel engines without 
sacrificing power and torque, the NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN said. 
  The engine, called P11C, uses pistons made of a new material 
mixed with heat-blocking graphite to raise thermal efficiency, 
in the first application of this new technology, it said. 
  The use of the new material makes it possible to raise 
combustion efficiency to 46 percent from the previous ceiling of 
43 percent for similar engines, the daily said. 
  Hino has used the engine in some of its large-size trucks 
and 
has no plans to sell the engine by itself, it said.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 19 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Indonesian Foreign 
Ministry Thursday acknowledged recent reports indicating the 
postponement of Moro-Manila peace talks if the Philippines 
Government could not take any concrete action against a 
planned-conference on East Timor issue to be held in its capital 
city. 
  The ministry's spokesman, Irawan Abidin, told ANTARA that 
Indonesia may cancel its hosting of the Indonesian-sponsored 
peace talks if Manila, between today and june, could not convey 
its proper response over Jakarta's displeasure over the 
conference. 
  The Moro-Manila peace talks were originally scheduled to 
resume on mid-June, after the first talks held in Jakarta last 
year. 
  Irawan Abidin did not deny that Jakarta has expected Manila 
to abrogate the conference due to take place in Philippine 
university from May 31 through June 3. 
  "If it is still carried out as scheduled, surely we'd regard 
it as "improper," said Abidin, who refused to consider his 
statement as a threat. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has previously described the 
entitled "Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor" previously as a 
political campaign against Indonesia's national integrity 
instead of an academic seminar discussing about the human rights. 
  His statement was based upon the fact that Jose Ramos Horta, 
an East Timorese figure who opposes the East Timor integration 
into Indonesia, Filipino leftist Renato Constantino, and Cecilia 
Jimenez were among the conference's organizers. 
  Commenting on the Philippine Embassy's statement that its 
government would try to limit the topics to be discussed during 
the conference, Alatas firmly said that it would not be enough. 
  "I don't see how a political discussion could be limited," 
he 
added and reaffirmed that Jakarta regarded the conference as 
political activities. 
  Spokeswoman of the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta, Sonya 
Braddy, earlier told a delegation of the Indonesian Youth 
National Committee (KNPI) that Manila does not want to annoy its 
bilateral relations with Indonesia due to the conference. 
  "The Philippines would try to minimize or even to eliminate 
any provocative attempts which could emerge in discussing the 
substances of the conference," the KNPI chairman, Tubagus 
Haryono, quoted Braddy as saying. 
  In the meantime, Irawan Abidin stated that he could not 
receive the reason that the Philippine Government could not 
cancel the conference as it is organized by a non-governmental 
organization in a university that has its own autonomy. 
  "I'm sure that the Philippine Constitution is containing 
articles, which acknowledge the government to take a certain 
action considering its national interest," Abidin concluded.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- North Korean President Kim 
Il-song says his country has been under U.S. sanctions since the 
end of the Korean War and wonders what further measures could be 
imposed on Pyongyang, the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper reported 
Thursday. 
  Kim further told a Korean-American journalist last month 
that 
China has no means to exercise influence over Pyongyang in any 
attempt to resolve concerns that North Korea may be developing 
an atomic bomb, according to the ASAHI report. 
  For more than a year, the United States has suggested 
imposing economic sanctions on Pyongyang if North Korea does not 
permit full inspections of its nuclear facilities to ensure that 
no radioactive material is diverted to a weapons program. 
  In an April 21 interview with U.S. ASIA NEWS reporter Moon 
Myong- cha, Kim again denied that North Korea is attempting to 
build a bomb and virtually dared the U.S. to impose sanctions on 
his economically beleaguered state. 
  Since the truce (ending the 1950-1953 Korean war), we have 
been under what are actually comprehensive economic sanctions by 
the economic sphere of the U.S. side, Kim said. 
  What further sanctions beyond those we have been subjected 
to 
can be imposed? I feel like saying once, go ahead and try, Kim 
reportedly said, accusing the U.S. of trying to drive North 
Korea into a corner over the nuclear issue. 
  Kim rejected the idea that China, North Korea's lone major 
ally, can play any role in resolving the nuclear stalemate, 
saying, we are not a vassal state of China. 
  The 82-year-old North Korean leader denied that his country 
was trying to build a bomb and insisted that they have no place 
to test an atomic bomb nor a target to use it against. 
  Despite Kim's insistence on the issue, Pyongyang has 
repeatedly refused to fully comply with demands by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors 
nuclear programs for the United Nations. 
  "If we show the IAEA everything they want to see, they will 
say they have doubts about other places that they want to see, 
and more places, and this attitude will continue." said Kim. 
  North Korea has rejected inspections of some facilities by 
saying they were military installations off limits to outside 
inspectors, but Kim said in the interview with Moon that 
inspections of the military sites must be carried out with 
checks of all military bases in North and South Korea. 
  Asked about North Korea's threat to turn Seoul into a "sea 
of 
flames," Kim said that Pyongyang's delegate to an inter-Korean 
meeting in March had told him the words had been uttered because 
the South Korean delegate "had gotten on his nerves." 
  Regarding the suspended talks for establishing diplomatic 
relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang, Kim said, "the door is 
always open no matter who the prime minister is."

a faculty of Korean university under the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  The article says: 
  History has never seen such society as the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea where politics strictly serves the 
people. 
  This is because the dear leader General Kim Chong-il 
possessed of the noble idea of "believing in the people as in 
heaven" shapes policies of benevolence, affection and trust. 
  The dear leader perfected a scientific political idea on the 
basis of the Chuche idea and established a new Chuche view of 
politics. 
  His noble political idea and unshakable political creed is 
that the popular masses are the master of politics and it must 
serve them. 
  One of the advantages of his politics of affection and trust 
is that all members of society can live and develop 
independently and creatively as the masters of the state and 
society with immortal socio-political integrity. 
  The dear leader General Kim Chong-il said: 
  "Genuine politics for the people means respecting them and 
doing them all favours." 
  His politics of affection and trust finds graphic expression 
in his famous slogan "We serve the people!" He guides the party 
and the state to firmly defend the interests of the people and 
strictly subordinate everything to them in making and 
implementing the lines and policies. 
  His politics provides all members of society with freedom 
and 
equality and gives full play to their individuality. 
  His is a great politics which makes it possible to give full 
play to social attributes of man. It also enables people to 
defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation, and 
mankind to live a happy life in harmony. This politics will be 
everlasting with the future of mankind. 
  His politics of affection and trust reaches the overseas 
compatriots, especially the Koreans in Japan. 
  We Koreans in Japan including the officials of Chongnyon 
live 
and fight full of confidence and optimism with the most precious 
socio-political integrity in Japan which is based on the 
principle of struggle for existence and the law of the jungle, 
not wavering no matter which way the wind may blow. 
  Even in the corrupt and ailing capitalist society, we live a 
dignified life with precious political integrity because the 
dear leader is constantly infusing life-giving water into us all. 
  There are many countries and leaders in the world, but no 
such leader as our dear leader General Kim Chong-il who works 
hard to give immortal socio-political integrity even to the 
overseas compatriots and exalt it.

  [Text] Bangkok, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Thai Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri asked for South Korea's efforts in rectifying 
the trade imbalance in Seoul's favor Wednesday, requesting that 
the two countries open trade ministers' talks within this year 
to discuss the issue. 
  Prasong promised to fully conisder Seoul's bid for 
non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council 1996-1997 and 
South Korea's request to have its banks acquire full service 
lincense from 1997. 
  Visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with 
Prasong for over an hour where bilateral trade issues and 
regional security agendas occupied most of the meeting, Yu 
Pyong-u, director-general of Asian Affairs at the South Korean 
Foreign Ministry, said. 
  Two-way trade last year closed at 1.76 billion U.S. dollars 
with Seoul netting 1.23 billion dollars in surplus. South 
Korea's investment in Thailand stopped at 190 million dollars 
due to the China boom that took businessmen's interest away from 
Southeast Asia to the new attraction in China. 
  Yu said Prasong specifically asked South Korea to allow more 
Thai imports in such products as tapioka and frozen chicken. 
  Prasong suggested that the two countries open their 11th 
trade ministers' talks within this year to address this problem. 
  Han, on the other hand, requested that South Korean banks be 
included in the 10 foreign banks that will be given full service 
license from 1997 to operate inside Thailand. 
  Prasong said his government will take into account Seoul's 
request. 
  Han explained the latest development on North Korean nuclear 
issue, emphasizing that the matter is not just a regional issue 
but a concern for the entire international community, Yu said. 
  The South Korean foreign minister is here on the second stop 
of his Asian tour that will take also take him to Vietnam and 
Indonesia.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance said its policy goals for 
1997 are the economy growing at 8.2 per cent a year, with 
inflation of no more than five per cent and current account 
deficit within two per cent of gross domestic product. Also, it 
wants all departments to shape up and cope better with the 
increasingly competitive economic environment. 
  Between May 13-15, the Ministry of Finance held a seminar on 
its five-year plan. It was chaired by Finance Minister Tharin 
Nimmanhemin, and attended by most senior officials. 
  Until recently, the plan which is to cover the years 
1993-1997 had been just a broad framework. The seminar was to 
refine the plan, transforming policy goals into policies and 
concrete measures. 
  Speaking at the seminar, Tharin stated the role of the 
Ministry of Finance. He said it must strive for the country's 
macroeconomic stability given that international economic 
conditions are changing rapidly. It should also try to bring 
about more equitable regional income distribution, but that 
shouldn't adversely affect the overall economy. 
  Thus, in its latest five-year plan, the ministry targets 
economic growth of 8.2 per cent a year in 1997. The ceiling for 
inflation and current account deficit (to GDP) is set at 5 per 
cent and 2 per cent, respectively. 
  "The growth rate that we set is not too high compared to 
current economic conditions. This is because we need to 
maintain macroeconomic stability , otherwise inflation could be 
too high causing the current account deficit to deteriorate 
further," said Suwan Phasuksawat, the Fiscal Policy Office's 
(FPO) deputy secretary general. 
  Suwan said the policy instrument that the ministry will use 
is the govemment's budget, especially the expenditure side. It 
has to be consistent with prevailing economic conditions, and 
for the year 1995 it will have to be a balanced budget. 
  He also said, "Public investment will become a major tool 
for 
the government to absorb the impact of externally induced 
economic volatility. It will decrease when the economic growth 
is too strong, but it will help activate the economy when it 
slows down." 
  Dr Somchai Ruchuphan, FPO secretary-general, said the 
ministry will seek to maintain the value of the baht so that it 
remains credible as it is increasingly used in Indochina. 
  "We seek to stabilize the baht because it is used widely 
[in] 
Burma as well as in Indochina. In 1997, the baht could be a 
currency for the region and in the near future foreign 
corporations would certainly issue baht-denominated bonds. We 
have to lay down necessary rules and look for measures to help 
keep the baht from excessively fluctuating," Somchai said. 
  He said the government's further financial liberalization is 
contingent upon an assessment of the past impact. 
  On revenue, three departments are involved. And their role 
from now on will be changed, Somchai said. 
  The Excise Department will have to enhance its operational 
efficiency as it has to collect taxes on consumption of 
gasoline, some electronic items, liquor, cigarettes and 
automobiles. The revenue from these tax items tends to rise 
along with the pace of economic growth. 
  The Revenue Department is expected to have a higher 
proportion of total government revenue as the base for 
value-added tax has expanded along with the economy trade and 
investment. And the department already has a policy to improve 
efficiency in tax collection. 
  The revenue of the Customs Department is expected to fall 
due 
to international economic obligations. But the department may 
have to collect tax from a larger amount of merchandise as the 
tariff rate will fall. 
  Treasury Department Secretary General Niphat Phukkanasut 
said 
the department would shift its attention to property 
development. It would adopt the private business concept and 
would propose that government agencies pay rental fees for the 
use of land which belongs to the Treasury Department. 
  In the seminar, Tharin said the ministry would help local 
government to have at least twice the current revenue. This 
will come from fees on land transfer, estimated to be at least 
Bt10 billion a year. 
  "Local government which sees active trading in land will 
also 
have higher revenue," Tharin said. 
  To privatize education, Tharin said he would propose to the 
Cabinet some tax, incentives, including allowing schools to rent 
land from the Treasury Department at concessional rates.

  [Text] Vietnam yesterday dismissed China's claim of 
sovereignty over the Blue Dragon oilfield in the Vietnamese 
continental shelf as "totally unacceptable", but said Hanoi 
would not go to war with Beijing over it. 
  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet told THE STRAITS TIMES 
in an interview: "We have to defend our territories. But there 
is no reason for us to use force in this in stance because there 
has been an improvement in relations between China and Vietnam." 
  The state-run PetroVietnam oil company is working with Mobil 
on exploring the Blue Dragon (Than Long) field, which the 
Vietnamese government claims is not part of the Spratlys. But 
China has said that the zone on the Vietnamese continental shelf 
should be transferred to the disputed Spratly-island chain -- 
claimed wholly or in part by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  Said Mr. Kiet: "Their claim to our territory is out of the 
question but we will try to resolve it by peaceful means." 
  Vietnam had called for measures to ease tensions. 
  Mr. Kiet said Hanoi and Beijng were also pursuing diplomatic 
means to resolve their dispute over the Paracel islands, which 
both countries are claiming. 
  "The Paracel issue is separate from the Spratlys dispute. It 
is strictly between Vietnam and China and can be solved through 
negotiation," he said. 
  China is reported to have deployed warplanes at an air base 
on the largest island in the Paracel chain to expand its 
striking power over the region. But Mr. Kiet said it was 
unlikely that the two countries would use force, as they did in 
l988 over the disputed islands when their navies clashed. 
  "The trend in the world and the region is economic growth 
and 
development. It will not benefit China and Vietnam to go to 
war," he said.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 18 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
following his visit to Myanmar [Burma] paid a working visit to 
Singapore as guest of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. 
  The two prime ministers during their talks yesterday 
exchanged views on practical measures to push up the 
implementation of the agreements recorded during the Singaporean 
leader's official visit to Vietnam in March 1994, including 
their cooperation in the building of the agreed industrial zone, 
tourism and air services, and ship building and repairing. The 
two prime ministers assigned Minister Do Quoc Sam and Minister 
of Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong the task of coordinators 
for the building of the industrial zone. 
  On regional issues, the two prime ministers reaffirmed their 
determination to contribute to the trend of peace, stability and 
cooperation in Southeast Asia. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said 
that Vietnam is actively preparing to become a full member of 
the ASEAN. 
  P.M. Kiet also met with Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew who 
paid 
him a courtesy visit, called on the Keppel Company, the 
Singaporean leading company in cooperating with Vietnam in ship 
repairing, oil and gas service and house building, and other 
places. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is scheduled to attend the Asia 
Society conference themed `Wave of the Future: ASEAN, Vietnam 
and China-Opportunities for World Trade', where he will deliver 
an address on Vietnam.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- U.S. Ambassador to Japan 
Walter Mondale on Thursday voiced hope for a successful 
conclusion of stalemated trade negotiations between the two 
countries, a Foreign Ministry official said. In a meeting with 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Mondale said he strongly hopes a 
planned meeting between U.S. and Japanese trade officials in 
Washington on Thursday will successfully find ways to resume the 
stalled economic framework talks, the official told reporters. 
  The meeting, involving senior officials from Japan's 
Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry and the Foreign Ministry and 
their U.S. counterparts, marks the first attempt by the new 
government in Tokyo to resolve differences with Washington over 
the stalled trade talks. The U.S. envoy also reportedly spoke of 
the need for both sides to try to flexibly meet each other 
halfway in a bid to restart the negotiations on establishing a 
new framework for bilateral trade. 
  Noting that healthy economic relations between the two 
economic superpowers is crucial, Hata also expressed hope for 
early resumption of the framework talks, the official said. 
  The bilateral negotiations on ways to widen foreign access 
to 
the Japanese market were suspended after the two countries 
clashed at the February meeting of U.S. President Bill Clinton 
and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington. 
  At the summit, Hosokawa rejected U.S. proposals for 
"objective criteria" or numerical targets to measure the 
progress of Japanese imports. 
  Mondale and Hata also agreed on the need for cooperation 
between the U.S. and Japan to encourage North Korea to remove 
concerns about the communist country's suspected nuclear weapons 
development program, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Recent U.S. trade policies 
are based on the free trade principle, Japan's Economic Planning 
Agency [EPA] said in a report Thursday, softening its earlier 
assessment that the policies are protectionist. 
  In the report, the EPA said the recent trade policies, which 
provide for ample funds for research and development in the 
high-tech area, are effective in giving a competitive edge to 
U.S. industries and in boosting the economy. 
  It is necessary for world trade partners, however, to 
establish international rules on government subsidies for 
high-tech projects in order to head off "subsidy competition," 
the agency said. 
  The EPA acknowledged that the U.S. trade policies are 
generally based on free trade principles and promoting market 
opening by its world trade partners. 
  But U.S. antidumping legislation is protectionist and blocks 
the rational pricing of goods by foreign companies that mass 
produce their goods and sell in bulk, the EPA said. 
  The U.S. antidumping policy should be discussed at the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), it added. 
  The EPA report was compiled by private-sector experts and 
academics on trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
held regular consultations Thursday [19 May] in Tokyo on ways to 
improve foreign access to Japan's paper market. 
  The biannual meeting was held to evaluate implementation of 
a 
set of measures both parties agreed during the paper trade talks 
in April 1992. 
  A U.S. official who attended the meeting told reporters that 
the two countries discussed "several areas" of the world's 
second largest paper and paperboard market. But he refused to 
disclose the contents of the talks. 
  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, only said, 
"we have yet to see results confirming a substantial increase in 
foreign access to the Japanese market." 
  The official said the foreign share of the Japanese paper 
market was only 3.9 percent at the end of 1993, up only 0.2 
percentage point from 1991. The official cited what Washington 
views as "the highly structured distribution system" and 
"discriminatory corporate purchasing practices" as major factors 
to thwart smooth American penetration of the 32 billion dollar 
market. 
  Due to these "systemic obstacles, persistent and strong 
efforts by the world-class competitor" in other markets have not 
been rewarded, the official said.

  [Text] The arrival here of the first group of five North 
Koreans who have fled logging camps in Siberia, Russia, 
yesterday was an event that sheds light on many new aspects of 
future inter- Korean relations. By arranging the settlement of 
the North Korean refugees here for the first time, the South 
Korean government is showing to the world its active involvement 
in matters related to North Korean refugees. The measure also 
indicates Seoul's will of not remaining a mere observer in the 
human rights issues of Pyongyang. 
  At the same time, by taking an initiative in bringing home 
the North Korean defectors, the Seoul government has weighed 
itself down with many new burdens. Firstly the government 
should take steps to ensure that the North Korean defectors 
successfully adapt themselves to life here. More important is 
the establishment of a comprehensive, consistent policy to deal 
with the problems of the North Korean defectors until 
reunification. An increasing number of North Koreans are 
expected to seek refuge in the South as life in the Communist 
country becomes tougher due to its sagging economy. An exodus of 
North Koreans to the South cannot be ruled out if the political 
system there becomes seriously unstable. 
  Most of all, the Seoul government is required to financially 
prepare itself for increasing numbers of North Korean refugees 
here. Under the current law the government provides various 
kinds of support for resettlement of North Korean defectors, 
including financial help. But when their number increases to 
hundreds, thousands or beyond, it will be virtually impossible 
for the government to take responsibility for all the North 
Korean defectors. Unofficial counts say up to 2,000 North 
Korean escapees are already living in China alone. 
  Several problems concerning the North Korean loggers in 
Russia are also to be resolved. Government officials say some 
170 workers have fled their camps in Siberia and 90 of them have 
expressed their intentions to resettle in the South. 
  Seoul has already announced the repatriation of all the 
applicants but their plan hardly seems plausible at the moment. 
The Moscow government is known to allow only North Koreans with 
permits for residence in Russia to leave for Seoul in order to 
avoid any friction with North Korea over the issue. But this 
restriction diminishes to a considerable degree the original 
purpose of repatriating the North Korean loggers. 
  Under domestic Russian laws, this permission is given only 
to 
foreigners who are married to Russian citizens or those who have 
stayed in Russia for over two years. The applicants need to 
present passports to confirm their nationality. Political 
considerations also affect the screening of applicants. Most of 
the five North Koreans who arrived here yesterday belonged to 
this category. But most North Korean escapees in Russia do not 
hold residence permits as they usually failed to carry passports 
when they left the logging camps. The camps keep the passports 
of workers to prevent them from fleeing. South Korean officials 
admit that those who do not qualify for Russian residence 
permits are the ones who really need to come to the South. 
Those who have already obtained permission are not in a need to 
hurry to the South as they have led a comparatively stable life 
in Russia, they say. The officials refused to give details on 
how many of the five North Koreans who came to Seoul on the day 
hold residence permits and how many do not. But it is presumed 
that one or two do not have permits.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The Asian sports world is 
in a state of shock after North Korea decided not to participate 
in team events at the Hiroshima Asian Games this October. 
  North Korea had been expected to take part in the Asian 
sports festival to try to promote sports exchanges with other 
countries and solidify its relations with Chochongnyon, a 
pro-Pyongyang organization of Korean residents in Japan. 
  The Hiroshima Asian Games Organizing Committee (HAGOC) 
announced Wednesday that North Korea sent a message earlier in 
the day conveying its decision not to participate in the team 
events of the Asian Games. 
  The deadline for the team events was May 5, while that for 
individual events is July 4. 
  "It must have been a difficult decision," a government 
official here said, "because if Pyongyang does not attend the 
Asian Games, it will be further isolated from the rest of the 
world." 
  North Korea is already isolated politically because of its 
suspected nuclear ambition and economically because of its 
state- controlled socialist system, which has held it from 
joining such bodies as the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) or world Trade Organization (WTO). 
  Compounding the problem, the reclusive state has skipped 
several international sports competitions. 
  North Korea has failed to participate in a recent series of 
major international events including last year's summer 
universiad in Buffalo, New York, and the winter olympic games 
held in Lillehammer, Norway, in February. 
  If Pyongyang chooses not to attend the Asian Games being 
held 
in a neighboring country, Japan, then it may be because of 
political or economic reasons -- not issues related to sports, 
according to the official. 
  Pyongyang did not specify its reasons in notifying HAGOC in 
the name of North Korean Olympic Committee President Pak 
Myong-chol, nor did it comment on whether it would participate 
in individual events, according to HAGOC. 
  North Korea did not take part in several international 
sports 
events in the past for political reasons. 
  For example, it refused to attend the 1984 Los Angeles 
Olympics following the line of Moscow, and it did not compete in 
the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
  Although Pyongyang sent teams to the 1990 Beijing Asian 
Games, the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and the 1993 Winter 
Universiad in Zakopane, Poland, it avoided international sports 
competitions again from the 1993 Summer Universiad in Buffalo. 
  Meanwhile, Pyongyang's likely absence from the Asian Games 
is 
frustrating Seoul's plans to revive inter-Korean sports 
exchanges and thus promote overall North-South relations, 
according to officials. 
  South Korean sports officials originally planned to contact 
their North Korean counterparts to revive inter-Korean soccer 
and table tennis matches and discuss promoting overall 
inter-Korean sports exchanges. 
  Moreover Seoul, trying to win the right to host the 2002 
world cup soccer finals, hoped to meet with senior sports 
officials from Pyongyang at the Hiroshima Asian Games to discuss 
co-hosting of the world event. Now, Seoul cannot expect such 
contacts.

<F P=106> [By reporter Nam Yu-chol] </F>
  [Text] Despite the political and military tension on the 
Korean peninsula over the nuclear issue, North-South trade 
continues to grow. The scale of direct and indirect trade 
between North and South Korea in 1993 was $186,591,000 (on the 
customs clearance basis), as much as a 7.6 percent increase 
over the 1992 level. In the recently released "Trends in 
North-South Exchanges and Cooperation," the National 
Unification Board says: "This scale of North-South trade is not 
small at all considering the fact that South Korea ranks fourth 
after China, Japan, and Russia in North Korea's volume of 
foreign trade, which is estimated at approximately $2.6 billion 
in total." 
  With the trend toward increasing North-South trade, South 
Korea's trade deficit with North Korea continues to grow. In 
1993 the volume of North Korean goods purchased by South Korean 
firms totaled $178,166,000 whereas the volume of South Korean 
goods purchased by North Korea totaled $8,425,000. As a result, 
South Korea recorded a trade deficit of $169,741,000 with North 
Korea. South Korea's accumulated trade deficit with North Korea 
since North-South trade began in 1989 has reached $451,893,000, 
indicating that South Korean firms continue to "buy goods from 
North Korea." 
  Despite the accumulating trade deficit, the volume of goods 
shipped to North Korea continues to decrease whereas the volume 
of goods brought in from North Korea continues to grow rapidly. 
Compared with 1992, the volume of goods shipped to North Korea 
decreased by 20.2 percent whereas that of goods brought in from 
the North increased by 9.4 percent. (Our government regards 
trade between North and South as domestic transactions and uses 
the terms "goods brought in" and "goods shipped out" for 
"imports" and "exports.") 
  Steel and metals lead the list of purchases from North Korea 
last year, accounting for 80.3 percent of the total. The reason 
is that North Korea abounds in gold nuggets, zinc, and other 
minerals, and South Korean firms view them as "profitable 
items." Walnuts, medicinal herbs, and other agricultural and 
forestry products rank second in the list of items preferred, 
accounting for 8.5 percent of the total amount of goods 
purchased from North Korea. Textiles ranked third, accounting 
for 5.9 percent. Except cotton towels, most of the textile 
goods shipped from North Korea, such as trousers and shirts, 
were processed in North Korea for South Korean firms on a 
commission basis. 
  Fibers leads the list of goods shipped to North Korea in 
1993 
accounting for 70.4 percent of the total volume, indicating 
that the import of textiles manufactured by commissioning 
sharply increased last year. South Korean firms supply Tetron 
fibers, cotton fibers, and other raw materials to North Korea, 
and North Korea manufactures textiles by using these materials 
and ships the finished products to South Korea or third 
countries. The volume of trade in goods processed in this 
manner, with textiles on the top, has increased more than seven 
times over the 1992 level, indicating that South Koran firms 
are very much attracted to North Korean light industry goods 
manufactured by using low wages. 
  With our technicians not allowed to visit or stay in North 
Korea, it is impossible to provide the on-site technical 
guidance necessary for processing by commissioning. Our firms 
think that as long as this problem remains unsolved, it will be 
difficult to maintain the rapid pace of increase in the volume 
of trade in goods processed by commissioning. Included in the 
goods shipped to North Korea that were reported to the National 
Unification Board are: color television sets, 508 tons of soap, 
and 270 sewing machines. 
  Despite aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula, the 
number of South Korean firms desiring to trade with North Korea 
has been steadily increasing. Last year South Korean firms 
engaging in trade with North Korea numbered 132, or an increase 
of nine over the 1992 figure. The major firms leading in trade 
with North Korea are mostly general trading firms of 
conglomerates, such as Samsung Co., Lucky-Goldstar International 
Corp., Daewoo Corp., and Sorin Metals. These four companies 
accounts for 73.2 percent of the total volume of goods brought 
in from North Korea last year. 
  The Samsung Co. led in terms of the approved amount of goods 
shipped to North Korea with $2,961,000 as it did in terms of 
the volume of goods brought in from North Korea, with Sunkyung, 
ltd. and the Daewoo Corp trailing behind. Ten companies 
recorded over $1 million each in the accumulated total of 
exports to North Korea since 1988. 
  Last year as in the preceding years, indirect trade through 
overseas intermediaries was the main form of trade between 
North and South Korea. Indirect transactions account for 98.3 
percent of all trade between North and South. North Korea does 
not yet officially approve North-South direct trade. Despite 
North Korea's official stand that it "will not trade with South 
Korea," the number of cases of direct trade increased from 11 
in 1992 to 14 in 1993. According to concerned sources, the 
number of North Korean offers of direct trade has noticeably 
increased since early this year. 
  These sources take the increasing offers of direct trade as 
a 
reflection of the worsening economic situation in North Korea. 
In trade with North Korea, large South Korean firms offer the 
most favorable conditions such as the payment of cash because 
their business strategy toward North Korea is aimed at 
expanding business ties with it even at the risk of losses. 
  Business sources say that the actual scale of North-South 
trade is larger than the government statistics indicate. Only 
those transactions that are reported to the government for the 
purpose of obtaining exemptions from customs are included in 
the government statistics. Companies report their 
transactions to the government on a selective basis for various 
reasons. In the case of indirect trade, it is practically 
impossible for the government to determine which are the 
ultimate receivers of goods and which are the ultimate shippers. 
  Our government has time and again enunciated its position of 
linking North-South economic cooperation to the nuclear issue, 
namely, the position that it will not agree to North-South 
economic cooperation as long as North Korea refuses to settle 
the nuclear issue. However, the abstract term "North-South 
economic cooperation" as used by our government should be 
interpreted as meaning "investment" only, not including 
"trade." The reason is that what the government is actually 
prohibiting is nothing but investment in North Korea, and 
despite tension aggravated by the North Korean statement about 
"turning South Korea into a sea of fire," direct and indirect 
trade between North and South Korea has been growing steadily.

  [Text] Whether or not to rewrite the Status of Forces 
Agreement (SOFA) is emerging as a major pending issue between 
South Korea and the United States with civil organizations and 
activists raising voices for a sweeping reform of the pact which 
they claim is uncommonly unfair. 
  Their demands appear to have gained momentum following the 
Tuesday transfer of a U.S. serviceman convicted of killing a 
Korean bar hostess to a local prison to begin his 15-year jail 
term. The National Campaign for Eradication of Crime by U.S. 
Troops in Korea yesterday issued a statement welcoming the 
decision to have Pvt. Kenneth Markle, 22, of Keyser, West 
Virginia, begin serving his sentence at the Chonan Juvenile 
Penitentiary, 150km southwest of Seoul. The body has 24 
nationwide activists' organizations as its fraternity members 
including the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification, 
Korean Federation of University Students, and Korean National 
Council of Churches (KNCC). It has led a series of campaigns to 
put an end to crimes by U.S. soldiers here and to revise the 
SOFA. It plans to hold a public hearing in October on the SOFA 
revision with a view to coming up with a singular draft bill to 
be submitted to the relevant ministries and the National 
Assembly, in addition to a nationwide move to collect signatures 
to this end. 
  What is cited as the most problematic point in the SOFA is 
that the government has failed to exercise jurisdiction rights 
over crimes committed by U.S. soldiers, campaign leaders said. 
  According to data compiled by the body, the crimes by U.S. 
soldiers from 1967 through 1987 numbered 39,452, of which only 
234 or 0.6 percent were handled by the government authorities. 
This is extremely unfair compared to the cases in the similar 
U.S. agreements with NATO countries, Japan and the Philippines. 
The percentage of eases in which the nations exercised 
jurisdiction over the U.S. troops marked 32,32 and 22 percent, 
respectively. 
  "As a matter of fact, Koreans are exposed to crimes by U.S. 
troops without proper legal means to be protected, due to biased 
articles in the SOFA," said Cho Chae-hak, chief secretary of the 
body. 
  Some 850 criminal cases involving U.S. troops occurred from 
October, 1992 through last August, with only 10 cases dealt with 
by the prosecution authorities, according to the Justice 
Ministry report to the National Assembly. In most cases the 
Korean government had to transfer American military criminal 
suspects to the U.S. military authorities because of the 
regulations under the SOFA. Even in cases when the government 
authorities exercise jurisdiction, the soldiers can be confined 
to facilities in the U.S. bases in accordance with the SOFA. 
  SOFA was signed in 1967 and was revised in 1991 first to 
scrap a clause under which the Korean government shall give up 
its jurisdiction if it fails to exercise it within 15 days after 
a crime. "But the newly-introduced point is thought to be 
virtually moot because it entails exceptions, as it empowers the 
U.S. side to remand the U.S. servicemen upon request, thus 
depriving the Korean government of the judiciary right," Cho 
said. 
  It also stipulates the Korean government should offer 
favorable treatment for the suspected U.S. soldiers upon 
request, thus enabling them to the be put into a U.S. jail. 
What is a serious problem concerning the "unfair" accord is the 
attitude of the prosecution authorities who tend not to be 
positive in exercising jurisdiction, even within the possible 
scope, Cho claimed.

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu, currently on a tour of Southeast Asia, stopped over in 
Seoul to attend a garden party for foreign diplomats hosted by 
the president Tuesday afternoon. 
  Han, who completed the schedule at his first stop in Manila, 
will leave for his next destination, Bangkok, after the event at 
Chongwadae (presidential residence) so he can get some rest on a 
trip that also takes him to Vietnam and Indonesia. 
  Ministry officials explained that it is customary for the 
foreign minister to attend the annual party for foreign envoys 
at this time of the year. They made it clear that there was no 
urgent reason for Han to fly back home during his overseas trip. 
The minister's one-day return was scheduled long before he 
embarked on his tour and, therefore, Thursday was left free, 
they said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 18, (YONHAP) -- Argentine Economic 
Minister Domingo Cavallo, saying that the business climate in 
his country is favorable, urged South Korean businessmen to 
invest in Argentina. 
  "Now is a good time for Korean business enterprises to 
invest 
in Argentina," Cavallo told a press conference held Tuesday at 
Hyatt Hotel in Seoul. 
  Argentina's economy is opening up speedily with 90 percent 
of 
state-run companies having been privatized, he said, adding: "In 
particular, we welcome Korean investment in automobile and 
electronics sectors." 
  Earlier in the day, Cavallo and Korean Vice Foreign Minister 
Hong Sun-yong signed an investment guarantee agreement. He also 
met with leaders of Korean business groups including Hyundai, 
Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar and asked them to invest more 
in the South American country.

  [Text] Seoul, 18 May (EFE) -- Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo said that his 5-day official visit to South Korea, which 
concludes today, has been a total "success." Cavallo said that 
trade and investments between the two nations will increase as a 
result of his visit. 
  The economy minister and Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
Sun-yong on 17 May signed an agreement for the reciprocal 
protection of investments in both countries. 
  Cavallo said that Argentine export of products such as 
fruit, 
fish, leather, oils, and beef to Korea, which have recently 
dropped, will increase significantly in the future. 
  On 16 May Cavallo met with Deputy Prime Minister Chong 
Chae-sok and other high-ranking South Korean Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry officials. Minister Cavallo also met with the 
directors of large South Korean conglomerates such as the car 
manufacturers "Hyundai" and "Daewoo" in order to discuss 
investment opportunities in Argentina with them. 
  The Argentine minister also talked about the possibility of 
exploiting Argentina's natural resources with representatives of 
companies such as "Samsung," the largest South Korean 
manufacturer of household appliances, and "Lucky-Goldstar," 
among others. 
  Cavallo denied reports that Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay have decided to postpone for three months an agreement 
on free trade that was scheduled to become effective in January 
1995. 
  Argentina exports mainly agricultural products and raw 
materials to South Korea, and imports equipment. 
  Last year the South American country exported a total of $66 
million worth of products to South Korea, some 42 percent less 
than the previous year, while Argentina imported South Korean 
products for a total of $535 million, 15 percent more than the 
year before.

  [Text] Pusan, May 17 (YONHAP) -- All 22 South Korean 
fishermen returned to Pusan Tuesday from a Chinese port, where 
they were taken after being seized by Chinese patrol boats in 
the East China Sea for alleged violation of Chinese waters late 
last month. The return of the fishermen and their boat, the 
Taehung-ho No. 27, follows an agreement reached between South 
Korean and Chinese officials last Friday in the southern port of 
Shanghai. The fishermen, all of whom appeared healthy despite 
their long detention, said they left Shanghai for Pusan last 
Sunday, 16 days after being seized. 
  The Pusan Maritime Police are questioning the fishermen to 
ascertain the situation at the time of the seizure. 
  Eleven fishermen from the Songkwang-ho No. 2 were whisked 
away by a Chinese patrol boat around noon on April 29 in waters 
220 miles southwest of Mosulpo, Cheju Island, where they were 
drifting due to engine failure, the fishermen said. 
  The Chinese patrol boat was initially tugging the fishing 
boat but it cut the tow rope when the Songkwang-ho No. 1 gave 
chase, they said. 
  About half an hour later the same day, the Taehung-ho No. 27 
was seized by another Chinese patrol boat in waters 175 miles 
southwest of Mosulpo when the fishing boat also suffered engine 
trouble, they insisted. All 11 fishermen on board were taken 
away. 
  China had demanded a fine of 100,000 U.S. dollars for 
violating Chinese waters and illegal fishing. They later 
lowered the amount to 13,728 dollars, covering the price of fish 
allegedly illegally caught by the South Korean boats and the 
fishermen's living expenses during their detention.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
office at Chongwadae, which has been embroiled in unexpected 
political disputes in recent months, is trying to climb out of 
the rut and forge ahead by tackling major pending issues. 
  Since President Kim returned home from visits to Japan and 
China in late March, it wouldn't be exaggerating to say that 
Chongwadae hasn't had a single day of respite beginning with the 
controversial revision of the Uruguay Round trade accord. 
  This was followed by violent clashes between conservative 
and 
reformist monks at the Buddhist Chogye order, a disruption in 
the wholesale operation of farm and fishery products, the 
Sangmudae scandal, the problem of resettling North Korean 
lumberjacks who escaped from logging camps in Siberia and, of 
course, the seemingly never-ending North Korean nuclear row. 
  But taking Wednesday -- a national holiday -- as a turning 
point, Chongwadae wants to put the series of events behind it 
and make a fresh start as most of these issues found resolution 
and government officials are awakening from their much 
criticized lethargy. 
  Chongwadae selected 11 "core tasks" on Thursday and 
proceeded 
to tackle them. They are: 
  -- Strengthening of the international competitive power of 
Korean companies through stable labor-management relations and 
steady push for a new economy, 
  -- International trade and trade policy, 
  -- Measures to spur development of the farm and fishery 
industries to cope with the effectuation of Uruguay Round 
accords, 
  -- Expansion of social infrastructure, 
  -- Buildup of an information superhighway network 
  -- Persistent development of advanced technology, 
  -- Steady easing of administrative restrictions, 
  -- Educational reform aimed at boosting national 
competitive strength, 
  -- Steps to stabilize consumer prices and other aspects 
related to the people's livelihood, 
  -- Political reform aimed at realizing clean politics, and 
  -- Diplomatic, unification and national security policy. 
  These are the problems on which Chongwadae wants to work and 
set forth broad outlines before President Kim visits Russia on 
June 1, according to sources. 
  Presidential aides are being careful, however, not to repeat 
the past pattern when a string of unforeseen events occurred 
following the return of President Kim from overseas trips. They 
hope that Kim's visit to Moscow will not be followed by an 
another series of thorny events. 
  President Kim spent a quiet holiday Wednesday as five North 
Korean loggers arrived in Seoul for resettlement in the South 
and the National Assembly settled down to conduct a 
parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal. 
  Kim took the initiative in creating "an atmosphere" in which 
all government officials can work hard at their given tasks. 
  He has invited freshmen and sophomore lawmakers from the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party to Chongwadae for what his aides 
called "frank and unassuming" discussions of various problems 
this week. 
  The president also met with lower-ranking presidential aides 
at Chongwadae and gave them a pep talk. 
  On Thursday morning, he held a meeting of seven junior 
presidential secretaries on economic affairs and urged them to 
take the lead in the government's efforts to increase the 
nation's competitiveness. 
  "Even if there are some disputes in the political sector, we 
can tide over any national difficulty as long as the economy 
moves ahead smoothly," Kim reportedly told the secretaries. 
  Kim is expected to invite another batch of first- and 
second-term DLP lawmakers to Chongwadae, including Reps. Sin 
Kyong-sik, Kwon Hae-ok and Yi Myong-pak, for dinner to express 
his thanks for their parliamentary work and to ask them to 
continue striving for political reform. 
  Kim's meetings with lower-ranking DLP lawmakers or 
back-benchers and working-level presidential secretaries are 
unprecedented. In fact, this is seen by many as part of Kim's 
efforts to soften his image as "a hard president."

  [Text] Seoul, May 18 (YONHAP) -- The government, as part of 
its campaign to boost the country's competitiveness, has decided 
to increase overseas training opportunities for public officials 
and widen the training scope of government agencies, 
international organizations and research institutes. 
  Two hundred public officials will be trained abroad next 
year, up 30 percent from 150, according to the 1995 state-funded 
training program for civil servants released by the Government 
Administration Ministry Tuesday. 
  Noting overseas training so far was limited to academic 
studies and getting degrees, public officials will also be sent 
to foreign government agencies, international organizations, and 
think tanks for field studies with a view to raising their 
practical abilities to handle external negotiations. 
  Training will no longer be restricted to advanced countries. 
Eighty officials will be trained at English-speaking countries; 
35 in non-English speaking countries like Japan, Germany, and 
France; 35 in other areas, and 50 in international organizations 
and research institutes. 
  Public officials in good standing and recommended by their 
agencies will be chosen by the end of October after testing 
their language ability, a Ministry official said. 
  On returning from their overseas training, officials have to 
serve two to three years in related posts, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Son Yong-tae] </F>
  [Text] On 19 May, the government decided to cope strongly 
with the student movement to thoroughly block pro-North Korean 
acts benefiting the enemy, while immediately exercising 
government power against students' radical, violent 
demonstrations and pursuing and arresting all masterminds. 
  The government decided this at an emergency countermeasure 
meeting held at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office at which 
working- level officials from the Ministry of Education, the 
National Security Planning Agency, and the National Police 
Headquarters participated under the presidency of Choe Hwan, 
superintendent public prosecutor at the Public Security 
Department of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office. 
  In accordance with this, prosecutors have begun making a 
secret investigation into the Committee for the Fatherland 
Unification and the policy-making committee of the Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon]--the two 
committees are virtually pulling the strings of the activities 
of the Hanchongnyon--to find out if their acts are benefiting 
the enemy. 
  The government also decided to arrest core cadres of the 
students movement--such as Mr. Kim Hyon-chun, 24, senior in the 
Shipbuilding Engineering Department of Pusan National 
University, who is chairman of the Hanchongnyon; and Mr. Yang 
Tong-hun, 22, senior in the Public Administration Department of 
Choson University, who is chairman of the Hanchongnyon's 
Committee for the Fatherland Unification and concurrently 
chairman of the South Cholla Provincial Federation of General 
Student Councils; with advance arrest warrants where necessary. 
  In addition, the government decided to arrest all those 
involved in trying to make contacts with the North, while 
thoroughly blocking acts of trying to make contacts with the 
North through the National Alliance for Youth and Students for 
the Country's Reunification. 
  A rally launching the activities of the Hanchongnyon will be 
held at Choson University [in Kwangju] from 27 to 29 May and the 
National Children's Sports Meet will be held in Kwangju from 28 
to 31 May. Therefore, the prosecutors are going to cope 
actively with this situation in cooperation with relevant 
organizations in the Kwangju area so the Hanchongnyon's rally 
will be held in a peaceful atmosphere and will not interfere 
with the sports meet. 
  Since the inauguration of the new administration, the 
government has thus far maintained a conciliatory attitude 
toward those in the students movement. The government has now 
decided to make a swift hard-line change on the basis of its own 
analyses that recent activities by the students movements have 
reached a dangerous stage.

  [Text] Seoul, May 18 (YONHAP) -- The Information Ministry 
on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of permitting 
around-the-clock broadcasting by domestic cable TV networks of 
Cable News Network (CNN) programs. The ministry thus denied 
some reports that the government was studying the possibility of 
allowing CNN programs to be broadcast all day in Korea through 
domestic cable TV. 
  So Chong-hwan, director-general of the ministry's broadcast 
bureau, said the issue will not be discussed any longer as the 
present laws do not allow all-day broadcast. 
  "It is a matter to be discussed only after domestic cable TV 
takes root," said suh, referring to a government decision 
adopted at a meeting of officials from the Economic Planning 
Board and other government agencies related with trade talks 
with the United States on May 11. 
  He stressed that all-day relaying of CNN broadcast cannot be 
permitted under any circumstances as "it is feared to cause 
serious cultural problems. TV viewers will be made to understand 
international issues through American points of view. The 
broadcast, if permitted, will adversely affect the development 
of the domestic cable TV," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on 
Tuesday called upon the nation's scientists and science-related 
officials to redouble efforts to further develop science and 
technology. 
  While presiding over a meeting of the State Advisory Council 
for science and technology at Chongwadae [presidential office], 
President Kim emphasized the need of using available science 
resources most effectively because he said such resources are 
limited in the country compared with advanced countries. The 
meeting was called to observe the first anniversary of the 
advisory council. 
  The president also asked for the resolute removal of what 
stand in the way to the nation's internationalization. 
  "The extent of our internationalization ranks 11th among 
developing countries, undermining our efforts to enhance the 
country's international competitiveness," Kim said. Following 
the meeting, President Kim hosted a luncheon at Chongwadae for 
the advisory council members led by chairman Yi Sang-ui.

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Following a month-long 
tug-of-war, the ruling and main opposition parties finally 
agreed Tuesday to conduct a parliamentary investigation into the 
Sangmudae scandal. 
  The agreement came at a meeting of party floor leaders at 
the 
National Assembly Tuesday morning. The assembly is expected to 
begin the probe right after it approves investigation plans at 
an extraordinary session to be convened on Saturday. 
  The accord was the product of a rare compromise worked out 
between the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the 
opposition Democratic Party (DP), both of which were well aware 
of the public's critical eye on the Sangmudae scam. 
  The scandal involves a medium-sized construction company 
which received a multibillion won contract from the Defense 
Ministry to move a military facility called Sangmudae in Kwangju 
to the outskirts of the city. 
  The DP alleges that the president of the company siphoned 
part of the project's profits into a slush fund, which 
eventually found its way into the ruling circle and was used as 
campaign expenses during the 1992 presidential election. 
  The opposition party has demanded that the National Assembly 
invoke its right to investigate national affairs and find out 
how the alleged slush fund was used and by whom. 
  The DLP and DP have been bickering for a month over who 
should be called as witnesses. The DP finally gave in and 
agreed with the DLP to limit the number of witnesses to 30, as 
the ruling party insisted. The opposition party also agreed not 
to include current and former presidents as witnesses. 
  As for the probe's length, the two parties had originally 
agreed that it would last 20 days. The DP demanded that 20 more 
days be added, however, and the ruling party apparently gave in 
as a compromise for the issue of witnesses. 
  In addition, the two sides agreed to trace the whereabouts 
of 
checks totaling 27.7 billion won that had allegedly been used by 
the construction company's president, Cho Ki-hyon. 
  There is no denying that for ruling party officials, the 
proposed investigation of the Sangmudae scam is an irksome 
undertaking, even though the scandal allegedly took place during 
the administration of Former President No Tae-u. 
  A parliamentary investigation into the scam would expose 
many 
old as well as new members of the ruling party. 
  Consequently, the DLP is expected to minimize the effects of 
the investigation as much as possible. 
  The Defense Ministry and the prosecution have already 
undertaken separate, thorough investigations into the scam. The 
ruling party is thus insisting that a parliamentary probe would 
reveal little else. 
  Everything that could possibily be known by authorities is 
already known, and some other aspects alleged by the opposition 
party have been rejected by the prosecution due to a lack of 
hard evidence. 
  What worries the ruling party, therefore, is the possibility 
that the opposition party will launch a political offensive 
during the parliamentary investigation, although the DP has 
already agreed not to call the present and former presidents and 
lawmakers as witnesses. 
  Both the ruling and opposition parties would face severe 
criticism if the upcoming probe failed to produce any 
substantial results since the DP has managed to plant deep 
suspicion among ordinary citizens through its unsubstantiated 
allegations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yun Tok-no] </F>
  [Text] Large corporations continue to join small- and 
medium-business [SMB] cooperatives. Originally, SMB cooperatives 
were organized to promote the common interests of small and 
medium businesses by pooling their efforts. Naturally, their 
members are primarily small and medium businesses. 
  No one can categorically say that the interests of SMB 
cooperatives and those of large corporations are always in 
conflict with each other. But depending on the circumstances, 
SMB cooperatives occasionally have to take a position 
diametrically opposite to that of large corporations. 
  Despite the primary characteristics of SMB cooperatives, 
cases of large corporations joining SMB cooperatives as their 
members have increased steadily for the past several years. 
  As a matter of principle, large corporations can become SMB 
members only with the approval of the SMB cooperatives 
concerned. Large corporations are admitted into SMB 
cooperatives when small and medium businesses need them and 
vice versa for mutual cooperation and interests. But according 
to cooperatives, there are some side effects. 
  As of the end of this March an additional seven large 
corporations joined five SMB cooperatives so far this year: 
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. joined Korea Electrical 
Manufacturers Cooperative; Korea Tungsten Mining Co., Hannong 
Co., and Koyang Furnace Industry joined the Korea Industrial 
Furnace Cooperative; and Hankuk Glass Industry Co. joined the 
Korea Glassware Industry Cooperative; Iljin Corp. joined the 
Korea Geographic Information Cooperative; and Koryo Industry 
Co. became a new member of the Korea Corrugated Cardboard 
Producers Cooperative. 
  Last year 21 large corporations joined 15 SMB cooperatives. 
For instance, Anam Electric Industrial Co., Tongyang Precision 
Co., and Korea Xerox joined the Korea Electronic Industry 
Cooperative; Samsung Electronics Co. joined the Korea 
Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative; and Hyundai Electronics 
Ind. Co. joined the Korea Communications Cooperative. 
  In 1992 as many as seven large cooperations joined the Korea 
Electronic Industry Cooperative. They are: Goldstar 
Communications, Samsung Electron Devices Co., Hyundai 
Electronics Indus. Co., Goldstar Information Communication Co., 
Daewoo Communications, Tongyang Nylon Co., and Koryo Systems. 
In addition, the Lotte Machine Manufacturing Co. and the Mando 
Machinery Corp. joined the Inchon-Kyonggi Machine Manufacturers 
Cooperative. In all, 15 large corporations joined eight SMB 
cooperatives in 1992. 
  Of the total 588 SMB cooperatives, 94 have large 
corporations 
among their members. 
  The combined membership of SMB cooperatives totals 46,500, 
of 
which 307 are large corporations, accounting for 0.66 percent. 
The Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. 
are among the largest corporations in our country. Most of the 
largest corporations in the country are among the members of 
SMB cooperatives, which are primarily for small and medium 
business firms. The case of Korea Electronic Industry 
Cooperative is most conspicuous, with 20 large corporations 
accounting for 4.6 percent of its total membership of 434 firms. 
  In the case of the Korea Pharmaceutical Production Industry 
Cooperative, eight of its 173 member firms are large 
corporations, accounting for 4.6 percent of the total 
membership. The percentage is 3.8 percent in the Korea 
Communications Cooperative, and 3.5 percent in the Korea 
Electrical Manufacturers Cooperative. 
  A large corporation can apply for membership in a SMB 
cooperative with the recommendation of five member firms when 
its admittance is deemed necessary for subcontract 
transactions, business alignment, technology transfers, the 
procurement of raw materials and parts, and other purposes for 
the development of small and medium businesses. When the 
cooperative's board of directors approves the application, the 
applicant can become a member of the cooperative. However, the 
number of large cooperations in any single cooperative cannot 
exceed 5 percent of its total membership. 
  In admitting large corporations, the SMB cooperative 
concerned has a decisive voice inasmuch as membership 
applications are subject to the approval of the co-op's board 
of directors. 
  The purpose of large corporations in joining SMB 
cooperatives 
is to maximize the mutual interests of large corporations and 
cooperatives. 
  First of all, the admittance of large corporations into SMB 
cooperatives has some positive facets in securing cooperation 
between large corporations and SMB cooperatives in areas such 
as technology transfer, subcontract transactions, and 
information on overseas markets. 
  In addition, large corporations and SMB cooperatives can 
promote their common interests by jointly participating in free 
group contracts. When an SMB cooperative cannot fulfill by 
itself the obligation to supply a certain amount of goods 
assigned to it under a free group contract, it can do so by 
admitting large corporations as its members. For their part 
large corporations can secure an outlet for their products by 
participating in free group contracts. 
  Large corporations cannot account for more than 20 percent 
of 
the total amount of goods supplied by SMB cooperatives under a 
free group contract. In reality, survey shows that the amount 
of goods actually supplied by large corporations under free 
group contracts is slightly over 5 percent of the total 
contract volume. 
  According to Korea Federation of Small Business, large 
cooperations accounted for 5.7 percent of the total amount of 
goods supplied by SMB cooperatives in the first half of 1993 
under free group contracts. 
  The percentage allocated to large corporations in the total 
volume of supplies provided by SMB cooperatives under free 
group contracts slightly decreased from 7.6 percent in 1990 to 
6.5 percent in 1991. Still, the portion of goods supplied by 
large corporations is not small. Large corporate members of SMB 
cooperatives participate in free group contracts of SMB 
cooperatives only where small and medium firms alone cannot 
fulfill their contract obligations. 
  Another reason large corporations are admitted into SMB 
cooperatives is that their admittance enables SMB cooperatives 
to seek common interests through joint purchases and other 
means. With the participation of large corporations in joint 
purchases, the unit cost can be lowered through a larger 
purchase volume. Large corporations for their part can enjoy 
the benefit of purchasing necessary raw materials and parts at 
lower prices. 
  For small and medium enterprises admittance of large 
corporations into SMB cooperatives can have the effect of 
preventing competition with large corporations in competitive 
bidding, according to concerned officials of SMB cooperatives. 
They say that by admitting large corporations as their members, 
SMB cooperatives in some cases can avoid competitive bidding 
with large corporations and succeed in signing free contracts 
on their initiative. 
  It is also pointed out that admittance of large corporations 
into SMB cooperatives has other positive aspects in promoting 
cooperation between large corporations and small and medium 
business in areas, such as information on overseas markets, 
technology transfers, and subcontract transactions. However, 
it is noted that admittance of large corporations has some 
negative side also. For instance, depending on circumstances, 
large corporations for their own interests may have a greater 
voice in the management of SMB cooperatives. 
  In some cases small and medium enterprises may find their 
voices drowned out by the louder voices of large corporate 
members when it is necessary to make a decision contradictory 
to the interests of the large corporations. In reality, in some 
cases large corporations join SMB cooperatives as an expedient 
way of staving off the opposition of small and medium 
enterprises. 
  Wishing to enter the lunch-box business, a certain company M 
attempted to join the relevant SMB cooperative, but it failed 
because of the deep-rooted antagonism between it and small and 
medium member firms of the cooperative. 
  Admittance of large corporations into SMB cooperative has 
both positive and negative sides. Concerned officials of 
cooperatives say that in the final analysis it is important to 
bring masterly management skills into play in order to maximize 
the mutual interests.

<F P=106> [By Yi Sang-ki, HANGYORE political reporter: "Kim Yong-sam, </F>
Yi Pyong-tae and the Hanahoe Generals"] 
  [Text] The periodic spring personnel changes, announced 
every April, has become a focus of attention inside and outside 
the military as the time draws near. They are the first 
regularly scheduled changes under Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, 
an ex-member of Hanahoe--the No. 1 target of reform last 
year--and, therefore, how he will treat Hanahoe officers is a 
matter of great concern. 
  The upcoming announcements are especially noteworthy in that 
they will provide a clue to the future direction of the Kim 
Yong-sam government's control of the military. Therefore, it is 
not a bad guess that both the military leadership and Chongwadae 
are in agony over this process confronting them. In that agony, 
merits and demerits of reforms last year are evidently working 
as a guide. 
  Aside from how Hanahoe officers will be treated, the coming 
changes are drawing attention to such questions as: Whether or 
not the command leadership will be replaced, and if they are, 
how extensively, and how substantially the newly created 
Deliberation Committee on Proposed Appointments will exercise 
its screening power. Also noteworthy will be changes involving 
Navy and Air Force officers. Also, a great majority of 
officers, remembering that the fall personnel changes last year 
were affected by considerations of private connections with the 
command leadership, are interested in knowing whether the 
problem will be corrected this time. 
  Informed military sources forecast that the upcoming changes 
will be kept within a narrow range. In substance, however, they 
are of important significance in that they are to show the will 
of the supreme commander and the future direction of his 
personnel management. 
  Speculation that the April changes--which may be moved up to 
late March because of the president's scheduled visits to Japan 
and China and the need for an early stabilization of the 
military--will be on a small-scale are based on the following 
factors: 
  First, President Kim, through five or six shakeups he 
carried 
out last year, has established his control over the military and 
is confident of his leadership as supreme commander. In other 
words, the president must have decided, they say, that there no 
longer exists the possibility of the military challenging him or 
rebelling against him. It can be said that the experience gained 
from the side-effects of the frequent shakeups last year--which 
even caused vacillations among commanding officers in some 
units--also contributed to this observation. 
  Therefore, the president clearly intends, they claim, to use 
maximum restraints on unnecessary changes for the sake of 
stability within the military. In addition, there was the death 
of Cho Kun-hae, chief of the general staff [CGS] of the Air 
Force, in the line of duty in a helicopter crash on 3 March. It 
is feared that another sweeping shakeup at this time could 
plunge the military into a vortex again. 
  In his speeches to the commencement exercises of the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force academies, held successively on 2, 4, and 8 
March, President Kim said that "there were times when the honor 
of the great majority of our military personnel treading their 
honorable path was undermined." He gave the impression that it 
was not the same president who dismissed Kim Chin-yong as the 
CGS of the Army and So Wan-su as the commander of the Defense 
Security Command [DSC], in a blitz about this time last year. 
  "The military life is a difficult and severe one. But it is 
an honorable one for the fatherland and the nation," the 
president declared for the sake of the honor of the military. He 
pledged to pay greater attention to lifting the morale of 
personnel as well as to programs for science-based national 
defense and the training of specialist manpower. In other words, 
the president, who consistently had relied on the "stick" in 
military management, has now promised the "carrot." 
  The general observation is that as a result of such changes 
in the president's policy and perception toward the military, he 
will likely give priority to stability and consequently will 
avoid replacing the Army's top leadership after all. 
  In fact, at a year-end Chongwadae dinner party for major 
commanders of each service last year, President Kim, in his 
conversation with Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, referred to reports of 
shells that had fallen on school playgrounds, chiding him that 
"there is some laxity in the Army these days." But the president 
called in the CGS to Chongwadae in February this year to 
encourage him, it was confirmed. 
  Since it is viewed as a certainty that there will be no 
reshuffle of the leadership of each service, it will be 
noteworthy whether the Ministry of National Defense [MND] and 
the leadership of each service will be able to achieve stability 
and harmony through the upcoming changes and, at the same time, 
resolve the private organization issue in an amicable fashion. 
  It can be said that the authority over the changes was, in 
effect, transferred to the MND minister and the chiefs of staff 
of the respective services. This is because it has become 
virtually certain that there will be no changes this time 
involving four-star generals, which are normally made by the 
president in person. Although some in the Army think that Gen 
Kim Chae-chang (18th class of the Military Academy [MA]), deputy 
commander of the Combined Forces Command [CFC], will be replaced 
because he is a Hanahoe officer, a majority believe that he will 
be retained because he was appointed by President Kim and, 
moreover, is outstanding as a military diplomat with the U.S. 
authorities and as a leader of operations. 
  Even if there are no direct personnel actions by Chongwadae 
for the foregoing reason, it is still doubtful that the present 
military leadership, including MND Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Army 
CGS Kim Tong-chin, Chief of Naval Operations Kim Hong-yol, and 
Air Force CGS Kim Hong-nae, will independently exercise their 
rights of personnel management; rather, Chongwadae is likely to 
influence them one way or another. "It proves that the military 
has been accustomed to the exercise of its rights by Chongwadae 
throughout last year," officers say. 
  Meanwhile, under the military personnel law revised late 
last 
year, a committee to consider proposed changes involving general 
officers was created to bolster the MND minister's authority. 
How the MND minister will exercise his strengthened authority 
remains to be seen. In the past, the MND minister's authority 
over CGS-recommended promotions for general officers was a mere 
formality; however, the new law empowered him to examine and 
screen the proposed promotions. 
  It is worthy of note that, unlike the days of former MND 
Minister Kwon Yong-hae when the minister and the Army CGS formed 
a single, vertical command system, currently they are from the 
same MA class and this is another factor drawing attention to 
the coming personnel changes. In particular, MND Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae's background relating to Hanahoe--the private 
organization whose members CGS Kim Tong-chin decided last year 
to exclude from considerations for promotions in principle--is 
complicating the situation, making it difficult to work out 
adjustments until the last minute, according to reports. 
  Since the MND is exercising its screening power for the 
first 
time, it is of course expected to go all the way trying to 
coordinate with each service on their lists of officers to be 
considered for promotions. Therefore, military sources foresee 
that there will be no cases of proposed promotions being turned 
down by the MND. 
  Consequently, actions on Hanahoe officers will inevitably be 
a focus of the spring personnel changes after all. On this 
point, the general observation is that MND Minister Yi, who is 
one of them, has no plan yet. He himself has on no occasion 
given any hint at all on his attitude toward Hanahoe. 
  After Col Paek Sung-to (MA 31st class) distributed a Hanahoe 
namelist in early April last year, officers whose names were on 
the list, even including field-level officers, were put at a 
disadvantage in their military life last year. The eyes of these 
officers and of outsiders are now fixed on the Army leadership 
to see if they will be again refused to be considered for 
promotions/reassignments this year again. 
  Former MND Minister Kwon Yong-hae and Army CGS Kim Tong-chin 
made it clear last year that "Hanahoe officers will be put at a 
disadvantage in terms of promotion in the first year, they will 
be treated on the same basis with their colleagues of the same 
MA class from the second year on." If so, there will probably be 
a relief for them this year. 
  However, since Yi Pyong-tae was installed as MND minister 
last year, there has been an atmosphere surging in the military 
stifling a settlement on the Hanahoe since. Meanwhile, in a 
year-end interview with Chongwadae reporters, President Kim 
explained his action in appointing Yi to the MND post, saying 
that "although he belonged to Hanahoe, he had never been a 
leader of it. Moreover, he has a strong will for reform." As 
seen in that remark, Chongwadae seems to be shifting to 
appeasement in resolving the Hanahoe issue. 
  On the other hand, an anti-Hanahoe climate, combined with an 
anti-Yi Pyong-tae mood, has brought a high wind to the Army, 
according to informed sources. In his first days as MND 
minister, Yi, like Don Quixote, inundated leaders of each 
service with directives, which led to the creation of an Army 
"7-Day Camping Team" -- and after debates, the team issued a 
report defining Hanahoe as the "enemy within," binding Yi hand 
and foot. 
  It occurred in early January. As contents of the report were 
partly leaked to media, they resulted in narrowing Yi's options, 
whose obtrusive acts already had caused strong distrust among 
military leaders in resolving the Hanahoe issue, according to 
sources familiar with affairs inside the military. 
  Until immediately before that, or late December, Yi 
reportedly had been planning to complete actions on Hanahoe 
generals with no more than the releases of Kim Sang-chun (MA 
19th class, director of the operational planning headquarters of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]) and Yi Tae-hyong (MA 19th 
class, director of the war potential planning headquarters of 
the JCS) from their respective posts. However, as the 7-Day 
Camping Team report defining Hanahoe as the "enemy within" was 
leaked, it inevitably narrowed Yi's options on the Hanahoe issue. 
  The anti-Hanahoe offensive escalated, forcing the Army 
leadership to attempt to persuade Hanahoe generals on the Army 
Headquarters Policy Committee and those awaiting their 
retirement to voluntarily retire from active service. In 
January, Kwak Tong-to (MA 21st class, major general) visited Lt 
Gen Yi Taek-hyong and Lt Gen Ham Tok-son (both MA 20th class, 
former 11th Corps commanders) and Kim Chong-pae (MA 20th class, 
former 3d Army commander) separately, who were moping away their 
time in the Policy Committee research room next to the Army 
Headquarters Seoul office in the MND building, to advise them to 
retire on their own. 
  The generals, except one, refused to follow the advice. Some 
of them expressed their displeasure, saying that "it could be 
different if the CGS in person comes to see me on that but...," 
according to reports. 
  They are said to have stated that "for us, it is not a big 
thing to retire, but we find it absolutely unacceptable unless 
there is a measure taken to rehabilitate those junior officers 
who were discriminated against merely because their names were 
on the reported list." Some were known to have even mentioned 
the legal retirement-age clause. Others rejected the idea of 
voluntary retirement, saying such retirement can be compared to 
dishonorable discharge. 
  Thus, the Army leadership's effort to coax Hanahoe generals 
into retirement ended in failure. To be exact, however, nobody 
in the military, even among Hanahoe officers themselves, 
believes that they can make a comeback from where they are 
awaiting their retirement. 
  Meanwhile, away from those lieutenant-general or 
major-general level officers who are either on the Army 
Headquarters Policy Committee or officially awaiting their 
retirement, there are the cases of Hanahoe generals still active 
in field army, MND or JCS posts. As for the latter cases, it is 
rumored that they will be possibly rescued on a selective basis. 
Such rescue of course will more likely take the form of 
reassignment rather than promotion, according to informed 
military sources. 
  Based on these speculations, it is also said that in the 
reassignments of field-level officers being announced after the 
spring changes for generals, the scope of reassignments for 
Hanahoe officers in particular will be considerably expanded. 
  Of the lieutenant-colonel and colonel-level field officers 
who graduated from the MA in the 27th-36th classes, 
approximately 10 Hanahoe officers in each class were demoted 
last summer from their key positions in the so-called big three 
commands--the Capital Garrison Command, the Special Force 
Command and the DSC--or from major posts in the Personnel 
Management office of the Army Headquarters, the Personnel Staff 
Headquarters, the MND and the JCS to leisurely assignments in 
educational centers or other front-line or rear units. 
  What sort of reassignments they will get will inevitably 
draw 
attention because they are linked to the rescue for them in the 
periodic fall promotions later this year. Commenting on the 
issue of field-level Hanahoe officers, a high MND official said 
that "since it is a very delicate problem, the MND has not yet 
adopted an official position. But I expect that when it does, it 
will be in favor of their rescue." "Whether they are rescued or 
again passed over for promotions, there will be repercussions. 
In that case, it will be wise to minimize sacrifices," he noted. 
  The same official added that the shift to stability, 
solidarity, and enhancement of the morale in the president's new 
policy for the military is another factor backing up that 
possibility. 
  Concerning the question of treatment for field-level Hanahoe 
officers, a considerably large number of personnel pointed out 
that several factors other than such high policy-level 
considerations will work as variables. 
  Needless to say, it is true that some in the military are 
persistently demanding--as the 7-Day Camping Team report 
did--that Hanahoe officers be removed. Their point is that they 
had received special favors as Hanahoe members in the past in 
promotions and assignments, and that as such, they are negative 
elements damaging solidarity of the military and, therefore, 
should be rooted out. Otherwise, it is impossible to hope for 
the development and reform of the military, they contend. 
  Their contention, however, became less persuasive as time 
passed over the past year, according to analysts. In the process 
of military reform, the removal of Hanahoe did not produce an 
idealistic picture as anticipated. To make it worse, the sparks 
began flying in an undesirable direction. Rumors widely 
circulating have it that posts vacated by Hanahoe officers were 
filled by people having personal school, regional, or service 
ties with the leadership formed after the start of the new 
government, causing discontent and distrust in the military. 
  In other words, factionalism and flattery are widespread in 
the military in the wake of such display of favoritism, even to 
the extent of creating a climate filled with nostalgia for the 
past. The following is a comment by Lieutenant Colonel "K", a 
non-Hanahoe officer working in an educational center which had 
been a place for about-to-retire officers before becoming a 
"place of exile" for Hanahoe officers: 
  "It is understandable that under the new government, those 
who had received special favors as Hanahoe members in the past 
were demoted from their posts for the sake of balance with other 
officers. However, I cannot understand why they had to be 
reassigned to an educational center. They are the people who 
were telling us that education is the most important thing; it 
is clearly contradictory that they send them to an educational 
center now. How could an education center could be a place of 
exile? When they saw the announced promotions in the periodic 
fall changes last year, some of which could have been totally 
unthinkable in the past, I heard many say that `the old days 
were still better.' Speaking of colleagues in my unit, they had 
first disapproved of Hanahoe officers but, after months now, 
those who are sympathetic with them for their capabilities and 
their attitudes are rapidly increasing in number." 
  Officers maintain that this sort of sentiment in the minds 
of 
non-Hanahoe officers is fueling dissatisfaction with the present 
Army leadership. 
  Some of them, along with Hanahoe officers, unhesitatingly 
complain that "the personnel changes last year were, in a 
nutshell, reassignments and promotions to fill Hanahoe-vacated 
posts with cronies of the military leadership." According to 
them, "the military leadership is taking advantage of the vacuum 
and, under the pretext of reform, is preoccupied with expanding 
its own influence." They contend that friction, factionalism and 
the feelings of helplessness are spreading in the military and 
that there is an urgent need to correct the situation. What they 
say is increasing its persuasion. 
  Chongwadae announced in a self-appraisal in February that 
the 
army-level commanding officers (four-star generals) were all 
replaced in the first year of the Kim Yong-sam government. Also 
replaced in this period, it said, were 73% of the 
corps-level 
commanders (lieutenant generals) and 63% of the 
division-level 
commanders (major generals). The who replaced them in this 
process were generals of the "new power group" of the 
single-line influence represented by Kwon Yong-hae, former MND 
minister, and Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, officers say. 
  Some people are apprehensively concerned that since Yi 
Pyong-tae took over as MND minister, however, there have been 
signs of the single command channel breaking into a dual one. 
According to them, the military in the Sixth Republic days 
could maintain its balance under the watchful eyes of Hanahoe 
from the Fifth Republic and the 9.9 [9th Div., 9th Airborne 
Brig.] clique; nowadays, however, the 9.9 clique, along with 
those close to former MND minister Kwon and CGS Kim, formed the 
power group and this group is thoroughly blocking Hanahoe and 
other rival groups. 
  Among the generals of the new power group, some are capable 
and well qualified, like Lieutenant General "K" and Major 
General "H" in the MND and Major General "L" in the Army 
Headquarters, while others are apparently ill-qualified for 
their posts. Those riding on their private relationships with 
the military leadership have become objects of distrust among 
junior officers. 
  In extreme cases, some generals are bent on finding a pull 
with Chongwadae, National Assembly and other political 
personages, not to mention the military leadership. Rumors 
circulating in the military have it that some even went all the 
way to Koje Island at the beginning of the year to perform a 
formal New Year's bow to President Kim's father, Kim Hong-cho. 
  In the military today, the following people represent about 
all promoted by Kwon Yong-hae in his minister days: 3d Army 
Commander Yun Yong-nam (MA 19th class) and MND Policy Office 
Director Cho Song-tae (MA 20th class) who had been both Kwon's 
policy planning officers in the MND when Kwon was vice minister; 
9th Corps Deputy Commander Yim Chong-sop (MA 22d class; former 
chief of the personnel staff) and Infantry School Commandant 
Pyon Kil-nam (MA 22d class), who were respectively the commander 
of the 6th Division infantry regiment and the artillery regiment 
when Kwon was the commander of that division; and Field Division 
Commander O Nam-yong (MA 24th class), who was Kwon's aide. 
  It is different with Army CGS Kim Tong-chin. A graduate of 
Kyongbok High School, which turned out many personages currently 
active in power circles, he served in all types of field and 
policy posts, including 1st Div. commander, 5th Army commander, 
MND Policy Office director, and ROK-U.S. CFC deputy commander. 
Thus, he is said to have developed much broader personal ties 
than Kwon. 
  First, among those who graduated from the same high school 
after him are: Maj.Gen. Sin Yang-ho (MA 22d class) of the JCS, 
Hanahoe officer; Chon Kwan (MA 23d class) and Kim Hui-sang (MA 
24th class), both commanders of major divisions in the 
metropolitan area; and Maj.Gen. Hong Sun-ho (ROTC 4th class), 
rear division commander. 
  Lieutenant Colonel "H", currently assigned to a major post 
in 
the DSC as successor of a Hanahoe officer, is another person 
drawing attention inside and outside the military because he is 
another Kyongbok High graduate. 
  A fairly large number of general officers who had been his 
colleagues in the service were promoted by CGS Kim and, for that 
reason, people often bear them a spite regardless of their 
abilities. 
  To Il-kyu (MA 20th class), commander of the Capital Garrison 
Command, served as deputy chief of staff when CGS Kim was CFC 
deputy commander; Brigade Commander "K", promoted to the present 
post last year, was Kim's colleague when they were both section 
chiefs. Lt.Gen. Chang Chang-kyu (MA 21st class), commander of 
the Special Force Command, and Lt.Gen. Yi Yu-su (MA 20th class), 
corps commander, served as a division commander and a armored 
brigade commander when Kim was the corps commander. 
  Maj.Gen. An Song-yong (MA 23d class) and Maj.Gen. Yi 
Chong-ok 
(MA 24th class), who both were reassigned as field division 
commanders on their promotion to major general last year, were 
also Kim's colleagues who served respectively as chief of staff 
and operations chief in those days. And Maj.Gen. Kim Sok-won 
(former Grade-A selectee), chief of the Army Headquarters 
operational staff division, and Maj.Gen. Yang In-mok (MA 22d 
class), chief of the munitions staff division, were a battalion 
commander and a regimental commander respectively when Kim was 
the division commander. Maj.Gen. Kang Chong-pil (MA 23d class), 
of a field army, was also a battalion commander in the same 
period. 
  Maj.Gen. Chong Yong-chin (MA 23d class), a field division 
commander, and Brig.Gen. Yim Su-won, Army Headquarters personnel 
management superintendent, served as battalion commanders when 
CGS Kim was the commander of 62d Regiment of 20th Division. 
  In addition, it is known that Brig.Gen. "H" of the 
communications force and Brig.Gen. "Y" of the engineer force 
served as communications corps commander and engineer brigade 
commanders respectively when Kim was the commander of 5th Corps. 
  Over the fact that so many people who had personal 
relationships with CGS Kim through work were promoted to major 
posts, opinions are divided in the military. Some say that "for 
reform of the military in a transitional period, it is necessary 
for a leader to promote, and use effectively people whom he can 
trust absolutely." "At a time when every move of the leadership 
in the Army Headquarters at Kyeryongdae becomes known to the 
foremost front in a matter of a few hours, you cannot but pick a 
person you can trust if you are to choose from among people with 
little difference in abilities." 
  Others argue, as strongly: "The true consummation of reform 
lies in the vitalization of the organization. But his conduct of 
personnel management focused on private relationships and 
deepening distrust among members of the organization. It is 
imperative that the military display its organizational power in 
perfect order at a time of emergency, and in this organization, 
complaints about personnel management directly lead to the 
weakening of combat power." 
  These people also point out that "the reason the 12.12 
[1979] 
coup by Hanahoe was possible was that at the time they did not 
operate by the dynamics and logic of the organization but were 
banded by private ties." 
  Therefore, officers who see problems in the leanings of the 
military leadership and its domains say that they are concerned 
about what sort of expressions they will find in the coming 
changes. For now, they expect that thanks to the appointment of 
Yi Pyong-tae as MND minister, the leanings will be eased to 
considerable degrees. 
  On the other hand, the 9.9 group--which, along with people 
close to CGS Kim, forms the new power group--includes these 
people: Kim Hyong-son (MA 19th class), deputy chief of staff; 
Lt.Gen. Yi Kyu-hwan (MA 21st class), field corps commander; So 
Kyong-sok (ROTC 3d class), chief of staff of the Education 
Command; Yi Yong-tae (ROTC 4th class), field division commander; 
and Maj.Gen. Chon Kwan (MA 23d class). 
  They are people who served in the 9th Division, 9th Airborne 
Brigade in the past when former President No Tae-u was the 
commander of these units. Along with the Hanahoe clique of 
former President Chon Tu-hwan, who was once the commander of the 
1st Division, 1st Airborne Brigade, they were known to be the 
mainstream of the military in the Sixth Republic. 
  Unlike Hanahoe, the 9.9 group is generally in good shape 
under the new government. Explaining the reason, a general 
officer said: "Soon after the start of the new government, the 
military leadership, which had not yet formed its own influence, 
found it beyond its capacity to remove Hanahoe, the biggest 
influence in the country in the past decade. Based on that 
judgment, it apparently tried to remove Hanahoe's resistance by 
forming an alliance with the 9.9 group." Another general said 
that "the balance of power in the military is not determined by 
factors inside the military alone." "The new government," he 
continued, "needed the help of the 9.9 group, the second largest 
clique in the military, to establish its control over the 
military. It must have had the understanding of, and the 
coordinating with, former President No Tae-u about it." "It 
should also be noted," he added, "that in the latter half of the 
Sixth Republic, when Kim Yong-sam changed his coat to join the 
ruling party, a substantially large number of military leaders 
pledged loyalty to him, and that those leaders were mostly 
members of the 9.9 group." 
  Of late, with the personnel changes approaching, rumors 
about 
private organizations named Mannahoe and Nanumhoe, and their 
relationships with the new power group, are circulating rather 
widely in the Army, straining the Army which had its measles in 
the Hanahoe namelist incident in April last year. 
  This is not the first time that people hear rumors of third 
private organizations in the military. This time, however, they 
are drawing extraordinary attention because of the time factor. 
  At the parliamentary hearings about the DSC at the time of 
the National Assembly inspection of government offices in 
October last year last year, Kim To-yun, then commander of the 
DSC, stated that "40-odd private organizations have been 
unveiled and disbanded since the start of the new government," 
making no mention of Mannahoe or Nanumhoe though. Rep. Kang 
Chang-song of the Democratic Party has been saying since early 
last year that "in addition to Hanahoe and Alcchahoe, there is 
Mannahoe in the military." 
  According to informed military sources, Mannahoe is led by 
"L", a former CGS, and "K", a retired four-star general, who 
were estranged by Hanahoe immediately before the start of the 
Sixth Republic. It is composed, they say, by officers of the MA 
15th through 29th classes, seven or eight of them from each 
class. According to rumors, this group was involved in the 
Hanahoe namelist incident last year; however, it is known that 
the official investigation into the incident failed to shed 
light on it. 
  Some in the military insist that the current rumors of the 
existence of Mannahoe and its identity are considerably at 
variance with facts. According to them, all that "L" and 
"K"--who, while in the military, had a strong antipathy against 
Hanahoe--did was to hold gatherings, based on personal 
friendship, to press Hanahoe into dissolution, and nothing else. 
  Others say that this private organization, which initially 
had little influence in the military, has grown into a powerful 
one as it occupied major posts taking advantage of the power 
vacuum immediately after the start of the new government. 
  According to informed sources, those classified as Mannahoe 
members include such influential figures as "K", "J", "L", and 
"P" (all major generals) and "K" and "L" (both brigadier 
generals) and "P" and "K" (colonels). With respect to Nanumhoe, 
another private organization, there are also a great deal of 
"rumors" circulating lately. Nanumhoe is known to be composed 
of field-level officers of the MA 30th through 37th classes, 
specialist officers in personnel management in particular. The 
identity of this group reportedly was first unveiled in the 
military in about 1986. 
  Nanumhoe was first formed as a social gathering of officers 
of the MA 30th and 31st classes in the Office of Personnel 
Management Superintendent, expanding its influence after Colonel 
"P" introduced them to General "L" and General "K", according to 
reports. This group maintains a close relationship with 
Mannahoe, say informed sources. Colonels "K" and "P" of the MA 
30th class, another Colonel "K" of the same class, and Colonels 
"J", "P", and "L" of the MA 31st class are reported to be the 
leaders of Nanumhoe. 
  Military sources say that inasmuch as the various rumors 
currently circulating about Mannahoe and Nanumhoe have the 
possibility of causing vacillations and tumult again in the 
military, authorities should look into them and make facts 
clear. They are concerned, they say, that there is the danger of 
the military being thrown into another Hanahoe-type vortex. 
  Officers are unanimous in saying that the upcoming changes 
should be carried out in a fair and reasonable fashion, that at 
the same time, there should be objective light shed on the 
rumors that are currently circulating. Then, what sort of 
specific changes are anticipated? 
  In the Army, changes are expected of two or three corps 
commanders and five or six division commanders whose 
replacements are approximately 18 months overdue. In particular, 
the coming change of To Il-kyu (MA 20th class), commander of the 
Capital Garrison Command, is drawing much attention. Some 
observers say that he will get his second assignment favorable 
for promotion to the four-star general rank, while others 
maintain that he has served only 1 year in his current post and 
therefore will be retained. 
  Among corps commanders, Lt Gens O Yong-u and Kim Kil-pu 
(both 
MA 20th class) are viewed as certain to be replaced because they 
have served out their terms in the current posts. As for Kim 
Kil-pu, a Hanahoe officer, whether he will get a second 
assignment is a matter of great concern. 
  At the same time, there is a prediction that Kim Hyong-son 
(MA 19th class), Army chief of staff, will also be replaced. 
They [O Yong-u and Kim Hyong-son] are likely to replace Chang 
Pyong-yong (MA 18th class), (?inspector general), and Chang 
Sok-nin (MA 18th class), commandant of the National Defense 
College, respectively, whose terms of office are to expire in 
April. 
  The posts to be vacated by them are expected to be filled by 
an MA 21st class officer and a non-MA officer or an MA graduate 
respectively. It is seen as certain that there will be no MA 22d 
class officers promoted to corps commanders this time. Along 
with changes in the Army, it is also expected that there will be 
changes carried out in the Air Force and the Marine Corps. As 
for the Navy, it is known that there is no need for changes. 
  In the Air Force, there will be a change to fill the post of 
director of the Intelligence Headquarters of the MND, which was 
vacated by Kim Hong-yol who succeeded Cho Kun-hae as Air Force 
CGS on the latter's death in the line of duty, plus changes 
involving offices thus affected. 
  While the possibility of an Army general officer being 
appointed to that intelligence post cannot be ruled out, 
military sources expect that it will continue to be occupied by 
an Air Force officer, considering the factor of the Air Force 
morale after the CGS' death. 
  In the Marine Corps, while Rear Adm. Yi Sang-mu (Naval 
Academy 17th class), 2d Division commander, is most likely to 
succeed Yim Chong-nin as commandant on the expiration of Yim's 
term of office, some see Rear Adm. Kwak Chae-song (Naval Academy 
16th class) of the JCS office as a possible successor. Also, 
these changes in the Marine Corps will be followed by the 
transfers of Sin Won-pae, deputy commandant, and Chon To-pong, 
special aide for the chief of Naval Operations. 
  The two rear admirals, Yi and Kwak, are both from the 
Pusan-Kyongnam [PK] region. So, when all the changes are 
completed, including those in the Marine Corps, the PK force and 
Kyongbok High graduates will form the mainstream of the top 
leadership of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps under 
the Kim Yong-sam government, pushing aside the TK 
[Taegu-Kyongbuk] force, the remnant of the Sixth Republic, 
completely.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yun Sok-chin: "Those Who Have Kim Yong-sam's </F>
Ears"] 
  [Text] Whose word does President Kim Yong-sam listen to 
most in leading his administration? WOLGAN CHUNGANG polled 69 
Chongwadae and National Assembly reporters covering the 
president's conduct of state affairs firsthand and at short 
range. Following is an analysis of the traits and backgrounds of 
those exerting mighty influence on the president, based on the 
findings of this survey (Editor's note). 
  The survey found that the person who exerts greatest 
influence on the Kim Yong-sam administration is Chongwadae 
Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong. He is followed by Yi Hoe-chang, 
prime minister; Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Yi 
Won-chong, senior presidential secretary [SPS] for political 
affairs, and Kim Chong-nam, SPS for educational and cultural 
affairs, in that order. Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the 
Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], placed sixth. 
  The poll showed Pak Kwan-yong "overwhelmingly at the top" of 
a list of public office holders with influence on the 
administration in general, as 68 of the 69 political reporters 
who responded to the survey voted for him among the top 10. As 
seen in "Table 1," 40 of them saw him as No. 1 in this category, 
10 as second, and 6 as third. Thus, they unhesitatingly gave him 
higher ratings. In total points, Pak gained a whopping 599 
points out of a possible 690 to hold a virtually incomparable 
lead over rivals. 
  It is often said that "how often you open the door to the 
president's office determines the degree of your influence." Pak 
Kwan-yong, in his capacity as Chongwadae secretary general, 
holds a one-hour tete-a-tete with the president at 0700 every 
morning, giving reports and receiving instructions. It is seldom 
skipped. People say that the frequency of tete-a-tete is the 
indicator of influence, and we saw the truth of what they say in 
the fall of the commander of the Defense Security Command [DSC] 
of our National Armed Forces in his status under the civilian 
government. 
  As late as in the No Tae-u regime days, the power wielded by 
the DSC commander was an almighty one; he often was in emulation 
with the Chongwadae secretary general and the director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning [ANSP]. This was because 
the presidents in the past had considered the DSC as a major 
channel of information and held a tete-a-tete with its commander 
on a regular basis. In the poll, altogether 50 persons were 
named at least once to one of the top 10 places but the DSC 
commander's name was not among them. 
  Pak Kwan-yong's rise is not just because of the post he 
holds. He was elected to the National Assembly four times. As 
the record shows, he has political sense, which is a necessity 
for a Chongwadae secretary general, plus an outstanding ability 
to analyze and deal with matters, however complex. For instance, 
on North Korea as the biggest pending issue, he is an expert to 
some degree. In addition, he is deft in handling business. 
  Notable more than anything else is that Pak, as Chongwadae 
secretary general, is displaying his superb leadership for 
harmony. He is playing without a hitch his role as the leader of 
the 50-odd members of the Chongwadae staff, including nine 
senior secretaries, holding them together in perfect cooperation 
to "assist the president." Outstanding is his ability to 
transform discord, predictable in the Chongwadae relationship 
with the DLP or the cabinet, into harmony whenever such tuning 
is needed. 
  When President Kim picked Pak as his chief secretary, it was 
a surprise to the public. He is not one of those so-called 
born-and-bred Sangdodong [Kim Yong-sam's private residence] men. 
He had never been a Kim Yong-sam follower, and when Kim Yong-sam 
was an opposition leader, Pak belonged to a faction opposing 
him. He had never held any of the top three posts in the former 
Reunification Democratic Party [RDP]. At the time of the 
three-party merger, he belatedly became a member of the 15-man 
RDP negotiating team, as a pinch hitter for Yi Ki-taek, the 
present chairman of the Democratic Party, who dropped out at the 
last minute. That was about the highest party post he ever held. 
  Nonetheless, Pak Kwan-yong beat other longtime followers of 
the president and became the "center fielder" in the core of 
power. The promotion was a superb pick by President Kim 
eliminating from the beginning every potential cause of dispute 
such as acts of arrogation and human walls. Pak functioned 
correctly as a Chongwadae chief of staff should to be deeply 
trusted by the president--and to emerge in the poll as No. 1 of 
the president's men. 
  Of the top 20, as many as seven are Chongwadae staff 
members. 
Yi Won-chong, SPS for political affairs, and Kim Chong-nam, SPS 
for educational and cultural affairs, placed fourth and fifth 
respectively, while Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, ranked 
eighth and Kim Yong-su, SPS for civil affairs, 12th. Pak 
Chae-yun, SPS for economic affairs, and Chu Ton-sik, SPS for 
public information, unexpectedly found their way to the list, in 
lower spots though, the 14th and 15th respectively. Of those who 
are not among SPS's, it is noteworthy that Kim Ki-su, director 
of the Office of Presidential Suite, made the list. Yi 
Won-chong, Hong In-kil and Kim Ki-su belong to the ranks of Kim 
Yong-sam men born and bred. 
  Conspicuously among RDP men born and bred, Home Affairs 
Minister Choe Hyong-u and former Minister of State Kim Tok-yong 
placed third and ninth respectively. They appear to be seen as 
exerting great influence on President Kim regardless of their 
official positions. Less than a year after his resignation as 
DLP secretary general because of a college entrance scandal 
involving his son, Choe Hyong-u was reinstated, as minister of 
home affairs this time, demonstrating his influence as the 
president's "right-hand man." 
  The same thing can be said about Kim Tok-yong, former 
minister of state, who once was generally viewed as "Kim 
Yong-sam's other self." Except his seat in the National 
Assembly, he currently holds no office in party management. 
According to some observers, however, he will be named to an 
important post again when the time comes as President Kim hinted 
at his New Year's press conference by expressing his confidence 
in him. 
  Kim Tok-yong had to leave the Administration because of 
controversies over his private organization and, for this 
reason, placed rather low in the poll for the weight he actually 
carries. But he is viewed as a darkhorse capable of a rollback 
to the top group at any time. 
  So Chong-won, who succeeded Kim Tok-yong as minister of 
state, placed 19th. He is another RDP man born and bred. 
  DLP figures are lagging a great deal in the ratings. The 
fact 
that even Chairman Kim Chong-pil, who is said to be entrusted 
with the "Yoido [location of DLP headquarters] administration," 
only placed sixth and behind senior presidential secretaries Yi 
Won-chong and Kim Chong-nam clearly shows it. Even that came 
after the president at the New Year's press conference bolstered 
Kim's image by saying that "party affairs will be the 
responsibility of the party chairman." It is an alarming 
development indeed. But for that comment by the president, what 
could have happened to Kim Chong-pil's ratings? Reporters 
themselves who responded to the questionnaire raised the same 
question. However, there is no question that in view of the 
"next" presidency, the chairmanship of the ruling party is 
always a powerful post and can by no means be treated lightly. 
  The DLP could save face, so to speak, with Mun Chong-su, 
secretary general, and Kang Sam-chae, director of the Office of 
Planning and Coordinating, placing 11th and 15th respectively. 
Particularly conspicuous is Mun Chong-su's rapid rise. He is a 
"YS man to the core" who, in the days when Kim Yong-sam ran for 
the National Assembly as an opposition candidate from Pusan's 
West district, used to accompany him to his nighttime stumping, 
carrying a torch in his hand. The two beat Yi Han-tong, flood 
leader, and Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Policy Committee, both 
influential members of the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] 
faction, to place among the top 20 in the poll. This development 
can be explained by what is called a trend of political lineage 
prevailing over the weight of individual character. This means 
that Mun Chong-su and Kang Sam-chae do not owe their rise to the 
party itself. 
  Rep. Kim Yun-hwan, rather unexpectedly, placed as low as 
18th. While it is unavoidable for him to act as leader of the TK 
[Taegu-Kyongsang] group whether he likes it or not, Kim Yun-hwan 
personally keeps a very low profile, presenting himself as a 
"person to be tested in light of the new era." But he is the man 
who contributed most to the DLP nomination of Kim Yong-sam as 
its presidential candidate, and it is only assumed that 
President Kim may not have lost his gratitude for the 
contribution. 
  From the National Assembly, only Speaker Yi Man-sop was 
listed among the top 20. Neither Vice Speaker Hwang Nak-chu, a 
member of the RDP faction, nor any of the standing committee 
chairmen was even close to the 20th spot. Even in the case of Yi 
Man-sop, it was because of the weight of the office he holds as 
the leader of one of the three branches of government that he 
placed as he did. Thus, Yi Man-sop's case can be compared to an 
"ornament" carrying little clout, according to reporters' 
opinions. 
  Compared with the party and the National Assembly, the poll 
showed the cabinet as exerting greater "influence" on President 
Kim. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang placed second and Chong 
Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and concurrently minister of the 
Economic Planning Board [EPB], 10th. Also, Han Sung-chu, 
minister of foreign affairs, and So Chong-won, minister of 
state, respectively took the 13th and 19th spots. 
  Yi Hoe-chang also represents another of one of the three 
branches of government. The weight of the office he holds, 
combined with his strong will as a fresh reformist, seems to 
have brought him high marks. Earlier, as the director of the 
Board of Audit and Inspection, he held fast to principle with 
his characteristic tenacity, and this was received with 
enthusiastic applause by the public. 
  It should be noted that President Kim is, first and 
foremost, 
a politician relying on the masses and that the degree of his 
trust in a public office holder is generally influenced by how 
the latter is received by the public. Therefore, it is not 
impossible that, if Yi Hoe-chang's performance as prime minister 
should prove creditable, the president could bring him into 
politics through the 15th general election and have him set his 
sight on the next presidency, although it is still too early to 
say so. At any rate, Yi is a man of conviction and his 
conviction changed the image of the Board of Audit and 
Inspection in a short period of time; when President Kim put him 
in charge of the cabinet, we were able to get a glimpse of his 
style of personnel management. In this connection, attention 
should be paid to the rise of Deputy Prime Minister Chong 
Chae-sok whose unique individuality and conviction propelled him 
to the top of the economic department. 
  Since its creation, the successive directors of the ANSP had 
held the levers of power, as one of them said "I am the power. I 
can ruin anyone." In the civilian government, however, ANSP 
Director Kim Tok placed seventh, indicating a measure of 
decline. He staged a close match with Chairman Kim Chong-pil and 
Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs, sandwiched between them by 
a margin of less then 10 points. In the number of votes they 
received within the top 10 places, there were little difference 
between the three, all marking slightly over 40. 
  Meanwhile, those polled were unanimous in saying that the 
seventh place for the ANSP director represents a substantial 
improvement from the initial days of the new government when 
President Kim unhesitatingly hinted at his intent to reduce the 
excessively enlarged power of the ANSP. Symbolic of it was his 
decision barring the ANSP director from attending cabinet 
meetings. In principle, that decision still is in effect. 
  Nevertheless, President Kim, who recognized once again the 
importance of the ANSP's existence after he entered Chongwadae, 
is known to see its director once a week for regular briefing. 
He seems to highly appreciate the leadership of Kim Tok, who was 
a scholar before becoming the ANSP director. In view of the 
nature of the ANSP as an agency operating behind the scenes, its 
real status could possibly be higher than people think. 
  Kim Yong-su, SPS for civil affairs, who placed 13th, 
especially attracts attention in many ways. An ex-prosecutor, he 
served as ANSP deputy director, then as assemblyman from the DLP 
national constituency. As the record shows, his career contained 
little that President Kim could appreciate. Nevertheless, he 
became the head of the civil affairs secretariat, an office that 
combined the functions of the audit and inspection secretariat 
and the civil affairs secretariat of the No Tae-u days. It was 
none other than Kim Yong-su who actually wielded--at working 
levels--the sword of reform and investigation which President 
Kim drew as soon as he took office. 
  Whoever its head, it was inevitable for the office of SPS 
for 
civil affairs to increase its influence rapidly during the first 
year of the YS reform. The fact that, of the six secretaries 
directly under him, three are "Sangdodong men" tells how much 
President Kim did to prop up Kim Yong-su. The three are Kim 
Kil-hwan, first secretary for civil affairs; Kim Mu-song, second 
secretary for same; and O Se-chon, first secretary on audit and 
inspection. Also, Kim Hyok-kyu, governor of South Kyongsang 
Province, had served as second secretary on audit and inspection 
until two months ago, helping Kim Yong-su. It appears that Kim 
Yong-su's influence will continue unless the president slows 
down his reform program in the future. 
  Another figure attracting attention is Yi Won-chong, SPS for 
political affairs. Since his days as an information secretary at 
Sangdodong, Yi has been one of those closest to YS, although his 
name was little known. They used to say that Yi Won-chong "can 
read YS' mind from the look of his eyes." When President Kim 
formed his first cabinet, he appointed Yi vice minister of 
public information in a surprise move, then senior political 
affairs secretary in less than a year, putting him at the top of 
senior Chongwadae secretaries. Yi Won-chong thus gained 
additional power and became a tiger with wings, so to speak. As 
vice minister of public information, he had attracted public 
attention as he exerted much influence on the administration. 
Since he has his place even closer to YS now, it would be 
interesting to watch how much more frequently the president will 
be seeking for "our Won-chong." 
  It so happened after all that the "top 20 men exerting their 
influence on the administration in general" shows that the 
closer the individual's workplace is to the president's office 
geographically, the greater is his influence. Chongwadae 
secretaries are unquestionably ahead, followed by those in the 
Integrated Government Building on Sejong Street. "Namsan" 
[ANSP], further away, is that much more behind, while the DLP 
and the National Assembly, located across the Han River, have 
even less influence, the survey found. 
  On the other hand, Sangdodong men are asserting their 
prominence regardless of where they are. One may say that 
"Sangdodong is in all its glory now." 
  In the "political" category, they demonstrated their 
influence even more conspicuously. Of the top 10, only 
three--DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, who placed 4th; Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang, 8th; and ANSP Director Kim Tok, 
10th--were non-RDP members. The rest were all Sangdodong men, a 
fact clearly indicating that it is not an overstatement to say 
that they are in control of the nation's politics. 
  As seen in "Table 2," Chongwadae Secretary General Pak 
Kwan-yong again emerged at the top in the "political" division. 
Although he did not score as overwhelmingly in total points as 
in the "administration in general" division, 28 of the 69 
political reporters put his name in the top spot. However, only 
47 altogether voted for him for one of the top five spots. So, 
in total votes, Yi Won-chong and Choe Hyong-u were found ahead 
of him with 57 and 50 respectively. 
  Most noteworthy in this category was the rise of Yi 
Won-chong 
to the second place. While 20-odd points behind Pak Kwan-yong in 
total points, he prevailed over Choe Hyong-u by more than 50 
points, clearly reversing their positions in the "administration 
in general" category. However, as in the "administration in 
general" category, Choe Hyong-u led Chairman Kim Chong-pil and 
Rep. Kim Tok-yong by substantially large margins. 
  Also notable is the advance to the seventh place of Hong 
In-kil, SPS for general affairs, whose office seems to be remote 
from politics. He strikes a good contrast to Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang, who placed second in the "administration in general" 
category but eighth--next to Hong In-kil--in this category. In 
the Sangdodong days, Hong managed the Kim Yong-sam faction's 
difficult housekeeping; he is known to be unrivaled in the depth 
of rapport with the president. At any rate, it is another case 
demonstrating the power of Sangdodong men. 
  ANSP Director Kim Tok received 24 votes, ranking last in the 
10th, a fact unthinkable in the past. It would strike people 
even strange--as strange as the fact that nowhere in the survey 
did the name of the Secret Service chief arise. The ANSP and the 
Secret Service, known in the past as a hotbed of political 
intrigues, are thus being returned to where they belong in what 
should be viewed as a welcome indicator of political 
development. In the Pak Chong-hui era, Secret Service Chief Cha 
Chi-chol behaved as if he had been "vice president," while under 
President Chon Tu-hwan, it was Chang Se-tong, Chon's Secret 
Service chief, who was known to all as the "No. 2 man in power." 
Compared with those days, the Kim Yong-sam era Secret Service 
has changed immensely indeed. 
  A general view of the "political" top 10 presents a fair 
mixture of Chongwadae secretaries, the cabinet, party executives 
and heads of the agencies under the president's direct control, 
seemingly maintaining a reasonable degree of balance. As said in 
the above, however, an in-depth analysis will unveil a virtual 
monopoly of power by Sangdodong men, prompting concerns about 
the lopsidedness. Critics say that at a time when improvement in 
the nation's competitiveness is an urgent demand, the larger the 
pool of talents, the better. 
  In the "economic" division, the cabinet held a conspicuous 
lead over Chongwadae. 
  As "Table 3" shows, Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister 
and 
concurrently EPB minister, placed first by marking 291 points, 
while Hong Chae-hyong, minister of finance, came out third, and 
So Sang, minister of health and social affairs, fifth. 
Meanwhile, Kim Chol-su, minister of trade and industry, was tied 
at sixth and Kim U-sok, minister of construction, shared the 
10th spot. Moreover, if Han I-hon, EPB vice minister, placing 
fourth, and Chu Kyong-sok, commissioner of the Office of Tax 
Administration, sharing the sixth place, should be included in 
an expanded cabinet category, the cabinet accounts for an 
overwhelming seven out of the 11 [including ties] listed in the 
top 10. A point common to all the seven is that they are 
ex-career bureaucrats and economic experts. 
  Only three were picked from Chongwadae--Pak Chae-yun, SPS 
for 
economic affairs, placing second; Choe Yang-pu, SPS for 
agriculture and fisheries, eighth, and Pak Kwan-yong, secretary 
general, ninth. Perhaps because the economy requires expertise 
more than anything else, Pak Chae-yun and Choe Yang-pu are, 
exceptionally, ahead of Secretary General Pak in this category. 
  Of the 11 persons, a surprise is the case of Yi Se-ki, DLP 
policy chief, who shared the 10th place. He is not an economic 
expert but yet was voted among the top 10 apparently for the 
reason that as chairman of the party Policy Committee, he is in 
the position of supervising DLP economic policies. Of the many 
self-styled economic experts in the DLP, reporters practically 
saw him as the only one who has any influence on President Kim. 
  In this category, Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok, the 
number one in this category, and SPS Pak Chae-yun, the 
runner-up, give the impression that they were engaging in a 
see-saw game as economic experts representing the cabinet and 
Chongwadae respectively. The result was that Chong Chae-sok 
prevailed over Pak Chae-yun by 40 in total points and four in 
total votes, or virtually by a decision. This strikes a good 
contrast to the days of Yi Kyong-sik, Chong Chae-sok's 
predecessor. 
  Pak Chae-yun, senior economic secretary, is a stubborn man 
with a style persisting in academic conviction, a factor having 
contributed to the consistency of policy and to its 
implementation. Based on that, he had worked as a 
behind-the-scenes adviser for YS since the latter's presidential 
candidate days, then played a leading role in drawing the 
100-Day Plan and the Five-Year Plan of the New Economy. As a 
result, former Deputy Prime Minister Yi Kyong-sik was kept at a 
distance in the decisionmaking process on major economic 
policies, until the day of his retirement. He was, in effect, 
dragged around by Pak Chae-yun. If Yi Kyong-sik had stayed on as 
deputy prime minister, Pak Chae-yun would have, in all 
probability, topped the "economic" category list. 
  However, the arrival of Chong Chae-sok--who rose to deputy 
prime minister and EPB minister only four months after his 
surprise promotion to minister of transportation--put on the 
brakes on Pak Chae-yun's one-man race. The "lack of experience 
in administration" and "want of political sense" was the 
weakness on the part of Pak Chae-yun; Chong Chae-sok had no such 
weakness. In addition, as seen in his unconventional speech and 
conduct, Chong Chae-sok could simply leap over what Pak Chae-yun 
would persist in in his scholarly fashion. This also enabled 
Chong to score higher. Choe Yang-pu entered Chongwadae in 
December last year when the post of SPS for agriculture and 
fisheries was created. Although it is too early yet for him to 
be appraised of his performance, his name apparently came up in 
the poll for the reason that he is one of the economic experts 
among the Chongwadae senior secretaries. A graduate in economics 
of Seoul National University, Choe is a typical agricultural 
economist. He obtained his doctorate at the University of 
Missouri and, after that, worked at the Korea Rural Economics 
Institute for 25 years. His extensive theoretical expertise is 
viewed as his strength. While Choe's administrative capability 
is yet to be tested, he served as the "mouth" of our government 
delegation in the 1989 Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  EPB Vice Minister Han I-hon is a graduate of Kyongnam High 
School, President Kim's alma mater, who served as an economic 
adviser in YS' presidential candidate days. He is generally 
known to be a notch above Pak Kwan-yong, the Chongwadae 
secretary general, in reading the president's mind. On the start 
of the new government, Han was appointed chairman of the Fair 
Trade Commission and, while in that post, reportedly continued 
to provide advice and suggestions to YS as requested. It is 
possibly for this reason that he emerged as the only vice 
minister making the list, placing as high as 4th. 
  The fact that Chu Kyong-sok, commissioner of the Office of 
Tax Administration, a vice minister-level post, placed sixth 
seems to be the result of consideration that he is the head of a 
"powerful agency" rather than that he is exercising any policy 
influence on President Kim. Under the past regimes, the Office 
of Tax Administration had been called an "ANSP of the economy." 
Chu Kyong-sok, appointed its commissioner in the Sixth Republic 
days, retained the post under the Kim Yong-sam government, which 
is a rare case. And behind it is a school relationship--Chu and 
the president attended the same high school. Similar is the case 
of Kim U-sok, minister of construction, who placed 10th. He is 
neither an economic expert nor a minister of a powerful 
department; however, he once served as chief secretary when the 
president was an opposition leader. And political reporters 
apparently expected that he would be exercising influence 
visibly and invisibly. 
  Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong, placing third, Health and 
Social Affairs Minister So Sang-mok, fifth, and Trade and 
Industry Minister Kim Chol-su, sixth, are all among the top 
experts in their fields and, as such, needed by President Kim. 
However, it remains to be seen whether the president would still 
want them after the three quit their cabinet posts. 
  Expert judgment is more in demand in the economy than in any 
other sectors. Perhaps for this reason, President Kim seems to 
value the views of ex-bureaucrats who have long experience. 
  In the "foreign policy, national security and reunification" 
division ("Table 4"), it was a close match between ANSP Director 
Kim Tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu second, and Chong 
Chong-uk, SPS for foreign policy and national security. The 
three were all professors before joining the government, and 
people are rather anxious to know who of them really exerts more 
influence on the president. 
  In this category, ANSP Director Kim, holding a monopoly on 
intelligence concerning North Korea, placed first, followed by 
an extremely small margin by Foreign Minister Han, whose 
overseas trips are exceptionally frequent, including visits to 
Washington over the North Korea nuclear issue. 
  Scholastic ability is one thing and administrative 
efficiency 
for insight into North Korea issues is another. SPS Chong 
Chong-uk, whose ratings for the latter are not very high yet, 
was pushed to the third place after all. With regard to the 
exposed deficiency in the realistic sense on Chong's part, it is 
known that Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong makes the necessary 
intervention each time. 
  When Han Wan-sang was deputy prime minister and concurrently 
minister of the National Unification Board [NUB], Pak Kwan-yong 
acted as mediator whenever differences occurred within the 
government's national security team. In the RDP days, Pak long 
served as chairman of the party special committee on 
reunification and of the National Assembly ad hoc committee on 
the same. As a result, he is known to be considerably familiar 
with North Korea issues. His fourth place, therefore, is nothing 
unusual. 
  The fifth place for Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister [and 
concurrently NUB minister], cannot but be a natural one for his 
post. However, affected by the current status of the NUB, plus 
his own conservatism, Yi was found not high in this category 
although he chairs the government's national security team. The 
minister of national defense is limited in his authority; the 
impression of the post is that it is more for the implementation 
of policies that have been decided than for making the 
decisions. Possibly for that reason, Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae placed only sixth. In the military government days, 
the chief of the General Staff of the Army and the DSC commander 
wielded considerably great power in connection with the security 
of the regime; under the civilian government, however, they were 
completely left out, in the same context that the Police Agency 
director, responsible for public security, was treated as 
irrelevant. 
  Also noteworthy is that Hwang Pyong-tae, ambassador to 
China, 
and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu placed seventh and eighth 
respectively with almost the same marks. As for the ambassador 
to the United States, it seems that his post was given due 
consideration under the circumstances that the nation is 
required to maintain close relations with Washington over 
"foreign policy, national security and reunification." 
Meanwhile, Hwang Pyong-tae was, in President Kim's Sangdodong 
days, so close an aide that people called him "No. 1 policy 
adviser" for Kim. Furthermore, Beijing, his present post, is the 
best observation point on North Korea, and he is assigned the 
extremely important duty of negotiating China's exercise of 
influence on North Korea concerning the nuclear issue. These 
factors seem to have led to the high marks. 
  Interesting is the fact that Rep. Chong Chae-mun placed not 
10th but ninth in the "foreign policy, national security, and 
reunification" division. He has successively served as chairman 
of the National Assembly committee on foreign policy and 
reunification and, as such, is duly recognized for his 
expertise. He belongs to the RDP faction and, moreover, he and 
the president share Pusan as their home city. So, it is quite 
possible that he will be exerting further influence in this 
field in the future. 
  Based on what has been said, it can be concluded that Pak 
Kwan-yong, the secretary general at Chongwadae, is the man of 
super power only next to President Kim Yong-sam. He not only 
placed "overwhelmingly first" in the "administration in general" 
division but topped the list in the "political" division as 
well. In the "foreign policy, national security, and 
reunification" division, too, he placed fourth among the top 10. 
Moreover, he even ranked ninth in the "economic" division where 
he is seen as a layman. Thus, in the survey, Pak Kwan-yong 
emerged as the unrivaled, all-around champion by scoring a 
majority decision. 
  The survey also clearly showed that those who are now 
wielding mighty power, including the secretary general, are 
mostly Sangdodong men. In particular, the results in the 
"administration in general" and "political" categories showed 
the following as the leading characters from Sangdodong: Choe 
Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Yi Won-chong, SPS for 
political affairs; Hong In-kil, SPS for general affairs; Kim 
Tok-yong, former first minister of state; Mun Chong-su, DLP 
secretary general; and So Chong-won, first minister of state. 
  Among cabinet members, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Deputy 
Prime Minister and EPB minister Chong Chae-sok, and Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu surfaced as men of influence. The "team 
power" of the cabinet could not beat the "group power" of 
Sangdodong men. The survey also found that except the case of 
ANSP Director Kim Tok, the holders of other offices that had 
been regarded as the "seats of power" in the past--the 
prosecutor general, the commissioner of the Office of Tax 
Administration, the chief of the General Staff of the Army, and 
the director of the Police Agency--have been greatly reduced in 
their voice under the civilian government. 
  This poll was conducted under the management of WOLGAN 
CHUNGANG. 
  The questionnaire-based survey was made on political 
reporters assigned to Chongwadae and the National Assembly, 
including those of dailies, radio-television networks, and press 
agencies. It also included many reporters of local dailies but 
no foreign correspondents. The questionnaire sheets were 
distributed on 8 and 12 February, and altogether 69 of them were 
retrieved. The questionnaire was as follows: 
  QUESTION: Of public office holders, who do you think is 
exerting most influence on the conduct of state affairs by 
President Kim Yong-sam? 
  Please write in the names of persons you choose--10 names in 
the first category and 5 each in the other three categories--in 
order of importance, as indicated below: 
  --administration in general: 1, 2, 3 ... through 10; 
  --political: 1, 2 ... through 5; 
  --economic: 1, 2 ... through 5; 
  --foreign policy, national security, reunification: 1, 2 
... through 5. 
  The "administration in general" was designed to get a 
general 
picture of those influencing the Kim Yong-sam administration. 
Considering the potential public interests nationwide in this 
division, the reporters were asked to choose 10 persons, one 
each for the first through 10th spots. 
  Separately, the survey had the "political," "economic" and 
"foreign policy, national security and reunification" divisions 
because these divisions, while representing major branches of 
the administration, require expertise. For each of these 
categories, reporters were asked to choose five persons. 
  In the tables below, "Overall Standing" of the person was 
determined by the "Total Points" he scored. 
  First, the number of votes each received for each place was 
counted. As for points scored, a different weight was assigned 
to each place--i.e., 10 points to the first place, 9 points to 
the second place, and so on down to 1 point to the 10th place in 
the "administration in general" division. Thus, the maximum 
points was 690 in the "administration in general" category and 
345 in the other three categories. 
  The "Total Votes" indicates the total number of votes 
received by each and is unrelated to the "Overall Standing." 
Generally, the "Total Points" and the "Total Votes" were in 
proportion to each other, but they were not in a few cases. The 
significance of the "Total Votes" lies in the fact that the 
person cannot, after all, be left out in his influence on 
President Kim in the respective division. 
  In the "administration in general" category, the respondents 
picked their top 10's and, based on the total points thus 
computed on them, WOLGAN CHUNGANG arranged the top 20 
point-getters in order of "Overall Standing." In the other three 
categories, the respondents picked their top five's and WOLGAN 
CHUNGANG arranged the top 10 point-getters in order of "Overall 
Standing" in each category. 
  The survey found that some names cited in the 
"administration 
in general" category came up again in other categories. Also, 
the reporters were asked to consider only public officials to 
prevent any unnecessary misunderstanding or irresponsible 
criticisms that might be caused by involving relatives by blood 
or marriage.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
received an initial report on the situation of the replacement 
of the fuel rods from the inspection team which started 
inspection activities in Yongbyon, North Korea, on 18 May, and 
discussed measures regarding this matter. 
  The inspection team consisted of three people who are 
conducting a detailed examination of whether the fuel rods were 
replaced at the five megawatt-class atomic reactor. It was 
learned that the inspection team made an initial report to the 
IAEA on the progress of the replacement of the fuel rods and on 
its future prospects. 
  In this connection, a well-informed source reported that 
high- ranking policy-makers in the IAEA closely analyzed the 
initial report, and discussed in detail on whether to seek ways 
to resolve this issue through negotiations with North Korea. 
However, the details of the inspection team's report to the 
IAEA on the situation regarding the replacement of fuel rods 
were not revealed.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is 
mapping out a countermeasure after receiving a report from the 
inspection team in North Korea, which began its inspection 
activities on 18 May, confirming that North Korea has already 
begun replacing nuclear fuel rods. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun has this report from Vienna: 
  [Begin recording] Three inspectors conducted inspection 
activities in Yongbyon, North Korea, for the second day. Since 
yesterday, the inspection team has examined the counter and 
seals and whether the surveillance equipment installed at the 
5-mw atomic reactor has been replaced. As a result, they have 
confirmed that the replacement of nuclear fuel rods has already 
begun. 
  The inspection team, in particular, has focussed on 
examining, with the guidance of North Korean officials 
concerned, whether it is possible to take samples from the used 
nuclear fuels from the reactor in the course of the nuclear fuel 
rods being replaced. As a result, they judged that the 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods is now at an initial stage. It 
is learned that they have reported this to headquarters. 
  Well-informed sources disclose that the inspection team has 
given its initial report saying that the replaced, used nuclear 
fuels are stored in such a way as to make it difficult to find 
out from which side of the reactor they have been taken out. 
  The well-informed sources say that the persons in high-level 
policy-making authority at the IAEA are receiving, and are 
making a detailed analysis of, daily reports from the inspection 
team in North Korea on its inspection activities and the status 
of the replacement of nuclear fuel rods. They are discussing, 
the sources say, whether to seek solutions through future 
negotiations with the North. 
  These sources predict that in view of the smooth progress of 
the consecutive two-day inspection activities, a scheduled, 
additional inspection of the radiochemical laboratory will also 
go smoothly. [end recording]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 17 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The launching 
of the Malaysian East Asian Satellite (MEASAT) by the end of 
next year will make Malaysia a regional communications centre, 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday. 
  MEASAT, as a regional satellite system, would not only meet 
part of the telecommunications and broadcasting needs of the 
country but also play an important role in Malaysia's 
contribution to the development of communications in Asia, he 
said. 
  This was acknowledged at coordinating meetings with the 
countries concerned over the last 18 months, he said at the 
signing of a contract, for the manufacture of two MEASAT 
satellites, between Binariang Sdn Bhd [Company Limited], a 
Malaysian consortium, and Hughes Communications International 
Incorporated (United States), here. 
  Dr. Mahathir said communication links throughout the 
country, 
including to the remote areas, would no longer be bound by 
restrictions with the availability of MEASAT. 
  In fact, he said, the communication links would stretch to 
areas outside the country which would be covered by MEASAT. 
  This will bridge the gap in communications between our 
country and neighbouring countries, apart from stepping up 
communications with India and other countries in Asia, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the government would also encourage MEASAT 
to invest in satellites launched by Asian countries. 
  The government wants communication links in the region to 
depend on and be connected with one another and be capable of 
upholding our regional traditional values, he said. 
  In this connection, he said, Malaysia welcomed the 
participation of other countries in the region in the launching 
of the second MEASAT satellite system in 1996. 
  Dr. Mahathir also said that the launching of MEASAT would 
take Malaysia to the era of a proper broadcasting service. 
  This was because MEASAT would pioneer the use of the KU-band 
transponder which had hitherto been assumed as unsuitable for 
the Asian region because of poor reception by small antennae in 
homes during heavy rain. 
  Other satellite systems in the region only operate on the 
C-band for analog telecommunications and broadcasting, which 
requires larger antennae and related cable systems, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said MEASAT had been designed with the latest 
technology, including the use of digital modulation and 
encryption. 
  In this way, the people in the country would be able to use 
the direct to user service through the KU-band whereby only 
authorised receivers would obtain the programmes. 
  He also said that the DTU system used by MEASAT not only 
provided for a high quality of broadcast and reception but its 
technology also allowed the government to license MEASAT under 
the broadcasting act unlike the C-band from overseas which was 
beyond control. 
  Dr. Mahathir said another of MEASAT's safeguards was for any 
other satellite wanting to cover Malaysia to coordinate with the 
energy, telecommunications and post ministry. 
  In the business sector, he said, DTU services could provide 
the latest news in the region, video conferencing facilities and 
despatch of financial data quickly.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 19 (BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and New 
Zealand agreed that the move to impose a minimum wage rate for 
the whole world will obstruct free trade and place the third 
world countries at a disadvantage, Foreign Minister Abdullah 
Ahmad Badawi said Thursday. 
  He said the visiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger 
felt that the move, initiated by several industrialised 
countries, would adversely affect the competitive edge of 
developing countries. Without the advantage of cheap labour, 
the developing countries would not be able to progress well. 
  Abdullah was speaking to reporters after attending a meeting 
between Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed and Bolger at the 
Prime Ministers Department here. 
  The New Zealand premier and his wife, Joan, arrived here 
Wednesday for a three-day official visit. Both the prime 
ministers agreed that the move to link the trade issue with 
matters relating to humanity will affect free trade and open 
market system, Abdullah said. He also said that Kuala Lumpur 
and Wellington had agreed to create as many forums as necessary 
to discuss matters relating to bilateral relations and regional 
problems. 
  The forums which might have the same objective as 
joint-commission but in different forms, could be established 
when necessary, he added. 
  Abdullah said Dr. Mahathir and Bolger also agreed that the 
forums need not have any definite dialogue framework but should 
be in the form of free discussions. 
  New Zealand had also suggested that there should be exchange 
visits in the form of working holiday between the youths of both 
countries to help strengthen relations between the peoples of 
the two countries, Abdullah said. 
  New Zealand now has a similar programme with Japan.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 18 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The Royal 
Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) has taken delivery of four Beechcraft 
B200T maritime patrol aircraft, a senior official of the 
Ministry of Defence said Wednesday. 
  The U.S.-made aircraft, which were purchased from Australia, 
will complement the squadron of the Lockheed PC-3 Orion maritime 
patrol aircraft being extensively used to patrol the country's 
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea. 
  The six-crew patrol aircraft, now parked at the RMAF base in 
Subang, near here, will be officially delivered to the air force 
in a ceremony next week, the official said. 
  They were flown here by RMAF crew with four Australian 
technical personnel. 
  Among the missions to be engaged in by the B200T are 
pollution detection, surface and sub-surface monitoring of the 
EEZ, inspecting off-shore installations as well as search and 
rescue (SAR). 
  The aircraft are also equipped with remote-sensing 
equipment, 
specialised avionics and sophisticated camera. 
  The Beechcraft B200T is an all-weather and night-day 
maritime 
patrol aircraft developed by Beechcraft Aircraft Corporation, a 
subsidiary of Raytheon Company, Kansas.

  [Text] Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has warned that recent 
moves by the United States have raised concern over its strategy 
in East Asia. He said the future of the Asia-Pacific [region] 
and the world in the next 20 years rests on having a stable 
triangular balance among the U.S., Japan, and China. However, 
in the last few months U.S. policies seem at odds with this 
objective. 
  Speaking at [words indistinct], Mr. Lee said the U.S. has 
been showing a certain limit of (?view). He gave as an example 
U.S. pressure on Indonesia and Malaysia on their labor policies, 
which had led to riots in Medan. The senior minister said the 
U.S. policy toward China is more mystifying as it threatens to 
derail China's economic reform by cutting off MFN [most favored 
nation status]. He said if the U.S. tries to thwart China's 
growth, China will surely want to return the compliment when 
they can do so. 
  Mr. Lee said China does not have to become an ally of the 
U.S. for world peace and stability, but it should not be made 
into an adversary. As for China, Mr. Lee said with its enormous 
potential, Beijing can afford to reassure its neighbors that it 
is a friendly and nonexpansionist power, and China can do so by 
making its intention and capability more transparent.

  [Text] New Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, says the 
strength of Asian economies is helping them resist pressures 
from the West on human rights issues. Speaking in Singapore, 
Mr. Bolger said Asian countries were now able to say with some 
firmness that their approach to human rights was as valid as 
that of anybody else. He said countries in Asia were better able 
to deal with such issues now that everyone wanted to trade with 
them. 
  Early this week, Mr. Bolger came under criticism in New 
Zealand for endorsing Indonesian rule in East Timor despite 
Western concerns over human rights there.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
announced that the IAEA inspection team, which entered North 
Korea yesterday [17 May], today arrived in Yongbyon, the site of 
inspection, and has begun inspection activities. 
  The inspection team will watch [kamsi] the work of replacing 
nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon and conduct additional inspection 
of the radiochemical experimental power station. The United 
States and IAEA have high expectations for the inspection team's 
activities. 
  After arriving in Yongbyon today, the IAEA inspection team, 
composed of three inspectors, started the work of confirming 
whether fuel rods were replaced by examining surveillance 
cameras and seals installed in the nuclear reactor. 
  Even if North Korea has launched the work of replacing 
nuclear fuel rods, the IAEA will persuade North Korea through 
various negotiation channels to allow the inspection team to 
optionally select nuclear fuel rods from nuclear reactor at the 
initial stage of replacement and to store them in a separate 
special instrument. The reason for this is that if the 
inspection team takes a sample from storage house after the 
replacement of the fuel rods is completed, the team cannot 
examine the precise amount of nuclear material already converted. 
  The IAEA maintains that the sample-taking during the time of 
replacing the nuclear fuel rods is indispensable for deciding 
whether the North Korean report that damaged fuel rods were 
replaced only once since the operation began in 1986 is true or 
not and for finding out the exact quantity of fuel rods replaced. 
  Therefore, the IAEA inspection team will decide the extent 
of 
progress in the replacement of nuclear fuel rods and examine 
whether the precise sample-taking is feasible at the present 
stage or not. The inspection team is given a special mission to 
urgently report the result of its aforementioned activities. 
  Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has expectations for 
the result of the activities by the IAEA inspection team in 
North Korea. 
  During a regular briefing today, U.S. Defense Department 
spokesman (Box) expressed an optimistic view, stating that the 
inspection team will complete inspections of the seven declared 
nuclear facilities, which remained unsolved last March, and will 
go into the nuclear reactor in question in Yongbyon and replace 
film and batteries.

  [Text] Hans Meyer, spokesman of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], said that the IAEA inspection team has 
begun inspecting Yongbyon nuclear facilities and that there has 
been no particular disturbance to speak of by North Korean 
authorities. 
  In a telephone interview with CHUNGANG ILBO on the early 
morning of 19 May, Spokesman Meyer said: "The three-member 
inspection team is communicating normally with the IAEA 
headquarters in Vienna, Austria." He said the inspection team, 
which arrived in Pyongyang on 17 May and moved on to Yongbyon by 
automobile, is regularly reporting to the IAEA headquarters 
every afternoon about its inspection activities. 
  Asked about whether North Korea had begun the replacement of 
fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor in question, he said: 
"The IAEA's official position is that, until inspections are 
completed, we would not know which is the truth as Pyongyang 
asserted that it began the replacement of fuel rods while North 
Korean officials in Vienna are denying this." He said no comment 
could be given on the scope and schedule of inspections 
"according to IAEA regulations."

  [Text] New York, May 18 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, former 
South Korean opposition leader, says the North Korean nuclear 
row must be resolved while President Kim Il-song is still alive 
because he is the only person in that country who can make a 
major policy concession. 
  "There is no need to respond with cynicism to Kim Il-song's 
recent peace gesture that included his express wish to visit the 
United States," said Kim, chairman of the Seoul-based Peace 
Foundation for the Asia and Pacific Region. 
  Speaking at a meeting sponsored by the Korea Society here 
Wednesday, Kim Tae-chung predicted that if Kim Il-song could 
tour the United States, he would become more "moderate." 
  The only way to settle the nuclear dispute is through the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between Pyongyang and 
Washington and American security guarantees for the communist 
state, including suspension of the joint South Korea-U.S. 
military exercise "Team Spirit," he said. 
  Earlier Wednesday, Kim met with South Korean correspondents 
in New York and denied press reports that he had said it would 
not be a problem even if North Korea possessed two or three 
nuclear weapons. 
  Kim reportedly told the WASHINGTON TIMES that if North Korea 
had two or three nuclear weapons, it wouldn't be much of a 
problem considering that the United States has more than 20,000. 
  Kim's alleged remark, made in an interview with the times 
and 
picked up by the South Korean press, has had political 
repercussions back home. Calling the report groundless, Kim 
apparently wanted to clarify his statement. 
  "North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons is unacceptable 
under any circumstances," he said. "If it already has, it 
(Pyongyang) has to abandon it." 
  The United States should try and accommodate North Korea's 
wish to establish diplomatic ties in order to resolve the 
nuclear issue, Kim said. He recommended a package deal between 
Washington and Pyongyang to solve all problems at once, as has 
been proposed by North Korea. 
  Kim Tae-chung also denied he had proposed that former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter be sent to Pyongyang as a special envoy 
of President Bill Clinton. He said he had only suggested that 
an unofficial envoy be sent to Pyongyang but only after thorough 
consultations with the Seoul government for the efficiency of 
the sending. 
  In his Korea Society speech, Kim Tae-chung said "the use of 
the China card" is crucial in resolving the nuclear row. 
  If North Korea refused to accept a proposal for a package 
solution, China would face enormous international pressure to 
join in UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea, he 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kim Tae-chung, former South Korean </F>
opposition leader, by Philippe Pons; place and date not given: 
"An Interview with Kim Tae-chung"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pons] The partition of the 
peninsula is a problem that obsesses Koreans. You suggested the 
creation of a confederation. Do you think that remains a 
realistic proposition today? 
  [Kim] More than ever. When the generals were in power, they 
paid no attention to the notion of a confederation, as they 
envisioned reunification as a mere takeover. This is the wrong 
solution, for two reasons: First of all, there is the German 
example; second, such a solution is rife with dangers. It would 
give Pyongyang good reason to build nuclear weapons. 
Furthermore, China would never accept it. Beijing has vital 
interests in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
Geographically, these two countries share a border over 
1,000-km long. In addition, North Korea provides China with 
access to the Yellow Sea as well as protection for Manchuria and 
the new industrial areas in Northeast China. Should we pursue 
such hegemonic ends, I am convinced that China would intervene 
directly in North Korea and would provide military support to 
Pyongyang if necessary. We must remember that, in the early 
1950's, China entered the Korean war to protect North Korea, 
which represented vital geostrategic interests for Beijing. The 
United States took no account of China's warnings. Moreover, 
the German example convinces us to proceed gradually. 
  In my hypothesis of a confederation of the two Republics, 
the 
first step would entail maintaining two independent governments 
for defense, foreign affairs, and domestic affairs. The 
confederation would have one joint body made up of delegates 
from the North and the South, it would be in charge of promoting 
trade and cooperation, and through restored mutual trust, pave 
the way for the ultimate establishment of a federal state, 
within 10 years or more. At first North Korea was favorable to 
a direct shift to a federation, then its leaders, including 
Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, stated they were ready to discuss 
my proposal. 
  [Pons] What do you think the Pyongyang regime is trying to 
achieve through its strategy of a nuclear threat? 
  [Kim] Kim Il-song's objective is not to possess atomic 
weapons but to normalize relations with the United States and 
the rest of the international community. He uses the "nuclear 
threat" as just another asset in negotiations. Let's face it, 
even with one or a few bombs, what can he do? North Korea's 
economic situation is terrible. If he does not secure some 
external aid, economic problems will ultimately topple the 
regime. Currently, North Korea's GDP amounts to one-tenth of 
South Korea's. Tomorrow, it will fall to one-fifteenth or 
one-twentieth. Should North Korea initiate a military conflict, 
it could probably destroy part of South Korea, but it could 
never win. I believe there is a logic to Kim Il-song's attitude 
and that he would not choose a suicidal course of action. He is 
looking for an honorable way out. 
  The DPRK changed its view on reunification three times in 
the 
last 50 years: Until 1953, Pyongyang attempted to turn the 
South into a Communist stronghold through military means. It 
failed. Afterward, and until the collapse of the USSR, North 
Korea's preferred tactic was subversion. This was a failure as 
well. From 1991, North Korea made an about-face, agreeing to 
simultaneous entry of both Koreas in the United Nations (which 
it had rejected for 40 years). Furthermore, since 1973 when Pak 
Chong-hi pushed for cross-recognition of the two Koreas (both by 
the United States on the one hand and China and the USSR on the 
other hand), Pyongyang has asked Washington to normalize 
relations. In practice, only Seoul has benefitted from this 
recognition so far, by establishing relations with Russia and 
China. On the other hand, no Western country has done the same 
with Pyongyang. North Korea can only feel isolated, or even 
betrayed, since it has gained nothing in exchange for the de 
facto recognition of South Korea as part of the 1991 North-South 
agreement. 
  As far as I am concerned, I can see changes in the position 
of North Korea's leaders (a case in point being the statements 
made by Kim Il-song on China's successful reformist policy in 
September 1993), and I think that we must help them transform 
North Korea, rather than backing them against a wall. I believe 
in persuasion rather than force: The Cold War did not change 
the USSR while detente gradually led to the internal collapse of 
the system. The same goes for Vietnam: France and the United 
States failed. Another example is Cuba. As for China, change 
began when Richard Nixon recognized Beijing. Today, I believe 
that China is no longer a threat to the rest of the world. 
These lessons from history should make us approach the problem 
of North Korea in a more realistic and flexible manner, so that 
the country may start changing. 
  [Pons] How do you explain the current crisis? 
  [Kim] On the surface, there is confrontation. However, I 
think that what is at stake is clear. North Korea is ready to 
give up its nuclear program as soon as it is allowed to 
normalize relations with the United States. On the other hand, 
Washington wants North Korea to give up its nuclear program so 
that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty can be extended more 
easily in 1995. 
  [Pons] Is not this the very "deal" the Americans and North 
Koreans have been haggling over for months? 
  [Kim] I believe that mutual stakes and benefits have not 
been 
identified clearly enough. In other words, the solution can 
only be a political one. However, the United States has only 
pursued an objective of a technical nature: inspection of 
nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
give the five North Korean loggers who arrived Wednesday the 
opportunity to attend public vocational training centers here 
according to their goals, aptitude and ability, a senior 
government official said Thursday. 
  The loggers, the first allowed to resettle here through 
consultations between South Korea and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, will receive social adaption education first 
for one or two months before entering vocational training 
institutes. 
  The government, however, is studying whether to place them 
in 
existing classes at the centers or educate them separately, 
according to the official. 
  The five North Koreans, who escaped from Pyongyang-run 
logging camps in Siberia, arrived here Wednesday afternoon via a 
third country. It is the first time that the Seoul government 
has allowed North Korean loggers to resettle here through lawful 
means. 
  In preparation for the increase in those wanting to come 
here 
after escaping from the Siberian logging camps or North Korean 
territory, the government is studying formation of a "special 
training team" to deal exclusively with North Koreans. 
  But if they want to receive higher education, the government 
will examine how to enable them to enter colleges or 
universities, the official said. 
  The government has tentatively decided to help the North 
Koreans find jobs after they finish vocational training, and 
will give them 10 million won (about 12,407 U.S. dollars) each 
in support for their resettlement.

Mongolian minister underlined. 
  The newspaper "UNEN" being an organ of the ruling Mongolian 
People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) informs about the inner 
party life and continuing nearly 14-days strike of workers of 
the Mongolian-British joint venture Temuujin Mench. 
  The newspaper carries an article by a young journalist Sh. 
Tserenpil [name as received] in which the author provides an 
analysis of the recent aggravation of the political situation in 
Mongolia arising in connection with the hunger strike by 
activists of the Mongolian Democratic Union and the Union of 
Mongolian Students urging the resignation of the government by 
P. Jasray. 
  The newspaper "ERH CHOLOO" (FREEDOM) issued by the Mongolian 
National Democratic Party (MNDP) provides the information that a 
group of members of this party decided to withdraw from the 
membership of the party and restore the Mongolian Democratic 
Party. The newspaper also gives the results of the public 
opinion poll conducted by the Press-Office of the MNDP. 
Answering the question how they assessed the recent political 
hunger strike organized by the Mongolian Democratic Union and 
the Union of Mongolian Students some 56.9 percent of surveyed 
said that the forms of struggle chosen that time were wrong 
though the demands right. 24.2 percent of the respondents 
considered the hunger strike to be the correct step.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, May 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The newspaper 
"ARDIYN ERH" provides the statement by the Prime Minister P. 
Jasray calling upon all the citizens of Mongolia. Addressing 
the public the head of the government informs about the state of 
the socio- economic situation in the country and the policy by 
the government. He dwells upon the issues concerning the 
political situation in the country. This is his first appeal to 
the public after the political hunger strike arranged in April 
by the Mongolian Democratic Union and the Union of Mongolian 
Students. 
  The statement says that the Cabinet of Ministers thoroughly 
considered the April events, the factors promoting its 
development and made proper conclusions. The political parties 
should heed this lesson and draw corresponding conclusions. The 
Mongolians have chosen a system of political democracy and free 
economy. Everybody understands that we are not to give up our 
choice and there is not any other way out. But the past events 
has shown that there is a lack of culture in the sphere of 
democracy referring to both us and and those who calls 
themselves "democrats". The political stability is the major 
precondition for checking the economic recession and creating 
proper foundations for the further development of the economy of 
the country, it said. 
  The newspaper informs that the work on working out the 
general scheme for the development of motor ways in Mongolia is 
being concluded. The general scheme envisages for particularly 
construction of asphalted motor ways in the directions from 
Darhan to Erdenet, from Ulaanbaatar through Choir to Sainshand, 
from Ulaanbaatar to Baganuur. 
  The newspaper also carries an article by a journalist I. 
Renchinhand devoted to the activities of the parliament 
describing the participation of the members of the parliament in 
the day-to- day sittings of the session of the Great State Hural. 
  The central official organ gives materials relating to the 
foreign workers working here under the labour contracts and an 
interview granted to its correspondent by the head of the 
Gandantegchinlen Monastery Hamba Lama D. Choijamts. According 
to him, at present there are over 120 monasteries functioning 
permanently where there are employed about two thousand lamas. 
  The trade union newspaper "HODOLMOR" carries the information 
concerning the strike by workers of the Mongolian-British joint 
Company "Temuujinmench" who demand to improve the labour 
conditions at the enterprise and wage raise. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by the president of the 
Federation of Mongolian Trade Unions G. Adiya referring to the 
financial and monetary policies and social welfare of the 
population. This issue is of great importance for establishing 
a proper system of social welfare which meets the needs and 
interests of the population under the conditions of market, the 
author noted. 
  The article says that for the last four years the gross 
national revenue has fallen by 50 per cent while the prices and 
tariffs risen as much as 21 times since the January month of 
1991. However the salary and wage of those employed in the 
budgetary organizations has been growing merely on an average 
three fold as against the above mentioned growth in the prices 
and tariffs. 
  The newspaper also provides materials touching upon the 
issues regarding the possibilities for application of hydropower 
in the western aimaks of Mongolia and the privatization of 
houses. The newspaper "BODLYN SOLBITSOL" publishes a number of 
materials covering the April event -- the hunger strike by the 
activists of the Mongolian Democratic Union and the Union of 
Mongolian Students urging the resignation of the incumbent 
government. The newspaper gives an article by a journalist J. 
Purev about the commercial banks. The article notes that there 
are about 15 commercial banks functioning of today in the 
country. 
  The newspaper also acquaints its readership with a number of 
first ladies of foreign countries among them are Hilary Clinton, 
Souha Tauil 'Arafat (spouse of Yasir 'Arafat) Queen of Japan 
Michiko and Nayna Yeltsyna.

Phnom Penh: "Things Fall Apart..."] 
  [Excerpts] Remember the Cambodian peace accords? The 
glittering ceremonies in Paris' Kleber conference hall? The 
United Nations peacekeepers in Cambodia? They are all a distant 
dream now as hundreds are killed and tens of thousands flee 
their burning villages. As if to remind the international 
community that Cambodia is back to warfare as usual, the Khmer 
Rouge has taken to beheading its victims, and a beleaguered 
government army seeks to shore up its morale by displaying the 
severed head of a captured Khmer Rouge soldier. [passage 
omitted] The head of a captured Khmer Rouge soldier, chopped off 
during interrogation in early May, is on display in front of a 
military installation on Battambang's main road. And according 
to the government, the Khmer Rouge raped and beheaded 10 
soldiers' wives in a border village, though independent 
confirmation of that report was unavailable. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk by Nayan </F>
Chanda in Phnom Penh; date not given: "The Centre Cannot Hold"] 
  [Text] How do you see the Khmer Rouge strategy? 
  The Khmer Rouge have taken Treng, which was the logistical 
base of the royal army. It is a threat to [the provincial 
capital] Battambang. It is difficult to foresee what the Khmer 
Rouge will do. Will they try to take Battambang? Or would they 
rather set up a state adjacent to Thailand stretching from the 
Preah Vihear temple through Oddar Meanchey to Bantey Meanchey 
and the northern shores of the Tonle Sap lake? That way they 
will have [an area rich in] timber, gemstones, rice and fish. 
The advantage is that they are very friendly with the Thais, 
especially the military. Once that is consolidated they will 
try to capture Battambang and Angkor Wat [temples]. Angkor is 
more than Preah Vihear. Angkor is a symbol of the country, its 
national grandeur. It will have an extraordinary psychological 
impact. It is like having control of 15 provinces. 
  What made you propose a roundtable with the Khmer 
Rouge? 
  When I saw that things were going badly in Pailin, I quickly 
proposed a new peace plan, I invited Khieu Samphan to come stay 
in the palace. But he said that the palace now has ceased to be 
neutral. Now I propose a cease-fire with the Khmer Rouge. But 
I wonder whether it is not a bit too late because the Khmer 
Rouge must be saying `we must take advantage of the 
demoralisation of the [government] soldiers.' I know that they 
wanted to join our government in order to sabotage our work and 
to try to destroy our fortress from inside. But, faced with a 
fast moving war, the monarchy is crumbling. At least we will 
have a chance to delay a total defeat and loss of Cambodia for 
some years if we let them share power. 
  How strong is the Khmer Rouge? 
  A leader of the government here, I won't name him, says the 
Khmer Rouge numbers 3,000-4,000 maximum and the Khmer Rouge 
problem is a minor problem. But the presence of Khmer Rouge in 
the country is like a leopard's spots. They are in Kompong 
Cham, Kompong Speu, Kampot and even in Sihanoukville--they are 
everywhere. Even near Phnom Penh they have sanctuaries. I 
think the Khmer Rouge has at least 20,000 men. 
  And what is the state of the royal army? 
  I know that the Cambodian army is very large. There are 
months when they are not paid. The soldiers have nothing to eat, 
they suffer from malaria, they have poor supply lines. We have 
a military organisation that is totally unique. In other 
countries there is a pyramid organisation of armies. At the 
bottom in large numbers are soldiers, and above them in 
decreasing numbers are corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, 
captains, majors, and colonels. At the top are generals--only a 
few in number. Here in Cambodia we have an inverse pyramid. The 
other day I saw Michael Costello, Australian deputy foreign 
minister. He told me that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen 
admitted to him it was difficult to find soldiers. When he goes 
to inspect the army he only finds officers. 
  What can the West do? 
  Costello told me, `If the situation is desperate, instead of 
letting your royal regime crumble we will consider the 
possibility of giving something in terms of weaponry.' But he 
did not promise anything. He spoke in his personal capacity and 
asked for my reaction. I would appreciate very much [the 
West's] military aid, but we should set up elite units to fight 
the Khmer Rouge, because weapons--like bread--distributed to old 
units will disappear. It is better to create new units rather 
than select soldiers from the existing units. But that too is 
difficult. When one creates an elite unit it has to be with 
volunteers. The volunteers will ask: fight the Khmer Rouge for 
what? To maintain a corrupt regime? To widen the gap between 
the privileged and the poor? 
  How are relations with Vietnam? 
  The Vietnamese move border markers deeper into our 
territory, 
dig canals inside our territory, creating a new border line. 
Digging canals has been an old tactic, but now the border 
markers are walking, they are walking towards the west ... they 
know we cannot take care of two fronts simultaneously. It is 
terrible. 
  What role would you like to play? 
  More and more people are asking me, even from the 
parliament, 
to rebuild the Sangkum Reastre Niyum [an all-party platform 
Sihanouk had built in the 1960's]. But it is too late. 
Ranariddh told me yesterday Funcinpec [National United Front 
for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] 
is ready to follow you, if you rebuild the Sangkum. But I am 72 
and sick. If I were 40 or even 50 years of age, I could have 
taken in hand all these things. I could have carried out reforms 
and even brought the Khmer Rouge in. What I can do now is 
prevent the Khmer Rouge from being branded outlaws. 
  [We will have problems] if the Khmer Rouge creates a stretch 
of territory in the north that will be open to free movement by 
the Thais. Thus, the Thais and the Khmer Rouge will gain, but 
it is Cambodia which will die. On the east the border posts are 
walking. It's like in Macbeth, it's the forest that walks trying 
to fell us, bring death to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Whether it 
is kingdom or republic does not matter. I assure you. You can 
write I am ready to have a republic as long as Cambodia is 
saved. For me it is Cambodia and not the monarchy.

  [Text] The MAINICH SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on 
Japan-U.S. relations at the end of April. According to the 
results, 36 percent of the respondents said "Japan-U.S. 
relations are in good shape or they are in relatively good 
shape" and the figure shows a 20-percent drop from 55 percent in 
the October 1991 telephone poll conducted by MAINICHI SHIMBUN. 
According to the poll's results, 21 percent of those surveyed 
forecast that "they [relations] will worsen in the future," far 
exceeding the 13 percent who predicted, "They will be better 
than now." Asked about their interest in and image of the United 
States, 76 percent cited "guns and murders," whereas 41 percent 
cited "freedom and democracy." Nonetheless, the results of the 
recent poll showed that while people's perception of the United 
States as an important nation heightened, the percentage of 
those surveyed who called for repealing the Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty shrank, and the percentage of those who favored keeping 
the treaty as written increased. 
  In the recent poll, 8 percent of those surveyed answered 
that 
"Japan-U.S. relations are in bad shape while 38 percent answered 
"they are in relatively bad shape." In this way, 46 percent 
answered that Japan-U.S. relations are not in good shape and the 
percentage was an increase of 13 percentage points from 33 
percent in the October 1991 telephone poll. The results of the 
recent poll showed that the younger generation takes a 
pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations while the older 
generation takes an optimistic view of them. Skilled engineers, 
business mangers, and white-collar workers take a relatively 
pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations. 
  Compared with the past three polls since 1989, the results 
of 
the recent poll showed a decline in the percentage of those who 
answered that "Japan-U.S. relations will be better than now" and 
an increase in the percentage who answered "they will worsen in 
the future." Almost all of the younger generation takes a 
pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations. 
  Asked about their interest in and image of the United 
States, 
76 percent cited "guns and murders" whereas 41 percent of them 
cited "freedom and democracy." Thirty-five percent cited 
"drugs," and 32 percent "racial discrimination," with 22 percent 
pointing to "movies, music, culture and recreation." In this 
way, the Japanese had no good image of the United States. Asked 
what to do with their family members or relatives if they intend 
to stay for a long time in the United States for study or other 
purposes, 42 percent said "I have no position," while 41 percent 
said "We oppose them staying in the United States for a long 
time," with 17 percent "favoring them staying in the United 
States for a long time." 
  Asked to comment on former Prime Minister Hosokawa who said 
"no" at the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, 73 percent said 
"We rate his act highly," while 23 percent said "We cannot rate 
his act highly." Asked to comment on the Super 301 provision 
which the United States intends to invoke to slap high duties on 
imported Japanese goods, 53 percent stated, "The United States 
should not invoke the provision" while 20 percent of them 
stated, "U.S. invocation of the provision is inevitable." 
  Asked about the cause of the trade imbalance between Japan 
and the United States, 17 percent of those surveyed said "Japan 
is responsible for it" while 16 percent said "The United States 
is mainly responsible," with 54 percent saying "We have no 
position." Compared with the October 1991 telephone poll, the 
results of the recent poll showed a flat line in the percentage 
of those who said "Japan is responsible for it or we have no 
position on it" and a drop of 16 percent from the 23 percent in 
the previous poll who said "The United States is mainly 
responsible for it." 
  Asked if the United States is an important nation for Japan 
in the December 1991 poll, 22 percent of the respondents said 
"The United States is the most important nation for Japan," 
while 61 percent said "The United States is one of the important 
nations for Japan," with 6 percent saying, "The United States is 
not such an important nation for Japan." In the recent poll, 
however, 23 percent said "The United States is the most 
important nation for Japan," while 66 percent said "The United 
States is one of the important nations for Japan," with 5 
percent saying "The United States is not such an important 
nation for Japan." In this way, the results of the recent poll 
showed that the Japanese perception of the U.S. importance in 
Japan heightened a little. 
  With regard to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the 
percentage 
of those polled who favored repealing the treaty largely shrank, 
and the percentage of those who favored keeping the treaty as 
written largely increased compared with the October 1991 
telephone poll.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 May Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] A government source on the morning of 18 May 
commented on a report in the 17 May WASHINGTON POST that Laura 
Tyson, chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), 
said the United States would stop exerting pressure on Japan 
over trade. The source welcomed the report, saying: "That is 
good news. They (the United States) have so far made so many 
unreasonable demands of us. Things must have changed a lot." 
  But the source added: "As far as Japan is concerned, even if 
the United States eases (pressure on Japan), Japan should 
continue to push for domestic demand expansion, tax reform and 
deregulation." The source thus indicated the government would 
continue to make efforts to alleviate U.S. pressure on Japan.

  [Text] Japan and the United States are set to hold vice 
ministerial talks on 19 May to discuss ways to resume the 
stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The vice 
ministerial talks will focus on coordinating the views of the 
two countries on tax cuts, the implementation of a new 
macroeconomic policy, and the establishment of objective 
criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market, which 
the United States has set as preconditions for resuming the 
stalled framework talks. The vice ministerial talks are likely 
to broadly examine Japan's compromise proposal that objective 
criteria apply only to the government procurement sector. 
Meanwhile, working-level talks also are expected to coordinate 
views of the two countries in an effort to have the stalled 
framework talks resumed prior to another round of Japan-U.S. 
summit talks scheduled for July. 
  The government has sent Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy minister of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Suzaburo Okamatsu, deputy 
minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI], to Washington to attend the vice ministerial talks. 
They will hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Barshevsky to 
discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks. The 
Japanese officials intend to make specific requests of their 
U.S. counterparts concerning three preconditions the United 
States has set for resuming the stalled framework talks, and 
then present them with Japan's response. They also intend to 
present a flexible macroeconomic policy to their U.S. 
counterparts and then feel out their response. 
  Their focus is to seek out a compromise on the establishment 
of objective criteria. President Clinton has definitely said, 
"the United States will not seek any numerical targets." 
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Kakizawa has stated, "it is 
necessary to set some quantitative criteria that do not actually 
result in establishing objective criteria." The Japanese and 
U.S. negotiators will discuss the possibility of establishing 
such quantitative criteria to expand the access of foreign 
manufactured goods and services to the Japanese market. 
  Of three sectors at issue -- government procurement, 
automobiles and auto parts, and insurance -- the Japanese 
negotiators are likely to present U.S. negotiators with a 
proposal for applying quantitative criteria toward the 
government procurement sector. Regulations on foreign access to 
the government procurement sector have been largely relaxed, and 
it is highly possible that both Japan and the United States can 
reach an agreement on this sector. The Japanese negotiators 
intend to urge their U.S. counterparts to make concessions by 
proposing a "phased formula" under which the criteria will be 
gradually applied to the insurance sector and the automobile and 
auto parts sectors. 
  Regarding macroeconomic policy, the Japanese officials will 
explain to their U.S. counterparts that Japan will continue 
cutting income taxes after 1995 and then seek their 
understanding of Japan's plan. The U.S. Government fears that a 
delay in breaking the deadlock between Japan and the United 
States could trigger a fall in the international value of the 
dollar and a rise in long-term interest rates. For that reason, 
the United States is softening its tough trade stance toward 
Japan. Japan intends to listen to "real" U.S. trade demands 
from U.S. officials and exchange information with the United 
States to examine whether those trade demands are acceptable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Countdown for Resumption of Stalled </F>
Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks were broken 
off during the February Japan-U.S. summit meeting after the two 
countries failed to reach an agreement on "objective criteria" 
designed to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The 
stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are likely to resume 
prior to another round of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for 
July following informal contacts between the two countries. 
Recently, the U.S. Government has conspicuously softened its 
tough trade stand on Japan. If both Japan and the United States 
agree to formally resume the stalled framework talks after 
ending a "cooling-off period," this could generate a sense of 
optimism currently lacking in the minority Hata government, 
whose future remains uncertain. 
  A top Foreign Ministry official, known for his cautious 
comments, said on the evening of 12 May: "There has been no 
fundamental change in the U.S. stand on trade with Japan, but it 
is seeking to reach agreement with Japan on resuming the stalled 
framework talks." He also did not deny that the climate 
surrounding Japan-U.S. relations has taken a favorable turn. 
  He made the comments because the two countries have 
confirmed 
the need to try to formally resume the stalled framework talks 
prior to the G-7 talks (the Naples summit) scheduled for July. 
Efforts so far include a telephone conversation between Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and President Clinton, and a meeting 
between Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Ambassador to 
Japan Mondale. 
  The situation in the United States has changed the climate 
surrounding the framework talks. Government officials in charge 
of the framework talks point out that the United States needs 
coordinated action from Japan to help stabilize U.S. financial 
and stock markets. 
  In the United States, prices for the dollar, bonds, and 
stocks have plummeted. Fearing a crash in the international 
value of the dollar, Washington has asked Japan and European 
nations to intervene in foreign exchange markets to halt a 
further slide in the dollar's value. Through financial policy 
coordination with Japan and Europe, the United States has 
managed to avert a financial crisis. Some government officials 
now say: "For the time being, the United States will not take 
any steps to further appreciate the yen." The reason, they say, 
is the fear that appreciation of the yen could spark inflation 
in the United States and fresh economic friction with Japan. 
  And there is also growing criticism of the Clinton 
administration's Asia policy in the United States and this must 
not be overlooked. An incumbent assistant secretary of state 
has made remarks linking criticism of China's human rights 
record to the issue of renewing China's favorable trade status, 
the Clinton administration has mishandled a caning incident 
involving an American youth in Singapore, and it has taken a 
tough trade stand against Japan in the framework talks. These 
issues are each targets of the criticism. 
  The administration has been harshly criticised for its less 
than adroit handling of diplomacy toward Asian nations and 
disarray has surfaced within the administration over its Asia 
policy. Government agencies have been complaining that the U.S. 
Trade Representative, in charge of handling trade matters, has 
taken unilateral action without regard for the importance of 
bilateral relations between Japan and the United States, thereby 
worsening relations with Japan. 
  A government source says that, as the November, off-year 
elections draw closer, "The Clinton administration sees it a 
good policy to proclaim victory in the economic dispute with 
Japan." 
  Foreign Minister Kakizawa has said: "Our immediate 
diplomatic task is to patch up sour Japan-U.S. relations." The 
Japanese Government intends follow this line and capitalize on 
the softened U.S. trade stand on Japan.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by Noboru Hatakeyama, deputy vice </F>
minister of international trade and industry until recently, at 
an interview with an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Partly as a congratulatory gesture to the new 
administration, the United States has softened its tough 
attitude toward Japan. Behind this is the realization that 
Japan would never accept numerical targets, and apprehensions 
over the recent trend of yen appreciation and comprehensive 
dollar depreciation. Dollar depreciation will trigger a drop in 
U.S. bonds and stocks, and bring about a rise in interest rates. 
If interest rates go up, U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
reelection strategy of maintaining low interest rates to sustain 
economic growth will be undermined. Such a change of U.S. 
attitude is also partly a result of domestic considerations in 
the United States. 
  Japan and the United States will start negotiations to 
resume 
the economic framework talks this week. The key to successful 
negotiations is Japan's macroeconomic policies, including 
sustained income tax reduction. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
should exercise leadership to make the decision to continue 
substantial tax cuts beyond 1994, and implement additional 
public investments before the end of June. Of course, finding 
revenue sources for this will be difficult, but I do not think 
it is necessary to come up with a concrete figure for the 
politically unpopular consumption tax hike. 
  If prior consultations on macroeconomic policies are 
successful, the framework talks can be resumed before the end of 
June, and there is a strong possibility that an agreement may be 
reached in automobiles and the two other priority sectors during 
the summit meeting in early July. As to negotiations on 
specific sectors, Japan should not change its position of 
rejecting numerical targets because such a demand is absurd, in 
the first place. 
  If, due to the political situation, a decision on sustained 
tax cuts could not be made, and an agreement on macroeconomic 
policies could not be reached by the end of June, there will be 
no progress in negotiations on specific sectors as well. Since 
Japan's surplus essentially has to do with macroeconomic 
policies, the United States will not be content merely with an 
agreement on specific sectors. Furthermore, since Japan is also 
saying it wants to resolve the trade imbalance, it would not be 
logical to go ahead with negotiations in the specific sectors. 
  After June, the right timing for Japan to arrive at a 
conclusion on tax cuts will be around December. Although the 
United States has set the deadline for identifying priority 
countries to negotiate with under the Super 301 provision of the 
Omnibus Trade Act (on the identification of and sanctions 
against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) in 
September, Japan should formulate its policies according to its 
own domestic schedule. If Japan tries to deal with this matter 
before the end of September, it would only prove that the Super 
301 provision is effective. Even for the sake of other 
countries, Japan should absolutely refrain from doing this.

  [Text] Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor 
Corporation, was elected to succeed Yutaka Kume (chairman of 
Nissan Motor Company) as chairman of the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association [JAMA] at the association's regular 
general meeting on 19 May. 
  During a news conference after taking over the chairmanship, 
Toyoda discussed the pending automobiles issue between Japan and 
the United States. He said: "With regard to objective criteria 
(to gauge the openness of the Japanese market), it seems that 
the government has some ideas of its own. However, I understand 
that (the two countries) have not agreed on numerical targets." 
He indicated that JAMA has no intention to set numerical 
targets for imports of auto parts and finished cars from the 
United States. 
  JAMA published an "action plan" to help promote the import 
of 
foreign-made auto parts and finished cars last March. As Japan 
and the United States work toward the resumption of the economic 
framework talks, certain quarters in the United States are again 
asking for concrete numerical targets. Commenting on this, 
Toyoda said: "Automobiles is a sector where cooperation is done 
mainly within the private sector in both countries. On the part 
of the Japanese makers, we feel that our efforts to increase 
local production of cars in the United States and working for 
(the elimination of friction) have not been fully appreciated. 
Numerical targets have not been approved even between the two 
governments." 
  Regarding objective criteria to measure the degree of market 
liberalization, Toyoda took a cautious stance, saying: "Some 
people suggest setting a number for car importers. Dealers 
function differently in Japan and the United States. What do we 
base this figure on? This is an issue that requires further 
discussion."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 May Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Unofficial negotiations at the vice ministerial 
level have started, and moves toward reopening the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks have gathered momentum recently. 
  The insurance sector, which has been listed as one of the 
priority sectors along with government procurement and 
automobiles and auto parts, was "nearing agreement" during the 
negotiations in February, and this time, an agreement is 
considered to be highly probable if negotiations are resumed. 
The focal issue from now on will be how to handle the issue of 
delaying liberalization in the "third sector" insurance covering 
injuries, illnesses, nursing services, and so forth, where 
foreign insurance companies have a relative advantage. The 
Finance Ministry expresses "confidence in concluding the 
negotiations," and recently, a plan to "work for agreement by 
postponing" liberalization in the "third sector" has been 
rapidly gaining acceptance. 
  During an 18 May speech before representatives of the 
insurance industry, Jim Foster, councilor (in charge of trade 
policy) at the U.S. Embassy's economic office, made a statement 
to the effect that: "Unlike automobiles and other sectors where 
private companies' cooperation is easy to come by, in the 
insurance sector, which is covered by numerous regulations, it 
is not appropriate to set objective criteria, such as market 
share or growth rate." This can be taken as a signal that the 
United States may not necessarily insist on numerical targets. 
Many in the industry have begun to speculate that the United 
States "has shifted to a softer attitude in insurance" 
(according to an industry source). 
  The pending issues in this sector include: how to handle the 
"third sector," and how to correct the practice of contracting 
for insurance policies based on "keiretsu" relationships. Other 
U.S. demands, such as clarifying standards for granting licenses 
and product certification, flexibility in approving new products 
and premium rates, and introducing a "broker" system for 
recommending insurance companies for the clients' benefit, have 
already been included as voluntary Japanese Government measures 
in the "outline of external economic policy reforms" issued in 
late March. 
  With regard to the "keiretsu" issue, Japan argues that "it 
is 
not proper for the government to meddle in private sector 
transactions," and "the United States is also showing a certain 
measure of understanding" (according to the Finance Ministry). 
  For the above reasons, the focus is now being narrowed down 
to how to deal with "third sector" insurance, where AIU 
[American International Underwriters] Japan and other foreign 
companies are doing brisk business. Under the present plan for 
insurance system reform, life and nonlife insurance companies 
operating in Japan will be allowed to participate in this sector 
within two years. Threatened by this, U.S. companies complain 
that "deregulation in this sector is unfair." Since this demand 
to delay liberalization runs counter to the general trend of 
deregulation, Japan has been obviously distressed. 
  The Finance Ministry, which is in charge of this issue, is 
cautious to state that "the negotiation process is in progress; 
we cannot show all our cards." On the other hand, the Insurance 
Council's report openly recommends that "schedule and method of 
implementation should take into consideration the position of 
foreign insurance companies." Senior Finance Ministry officials 
believe that "a pledge to foreign countries has to be 
fulfilled." It seems that Japan may be forced to compromise.

<F P=106> [By Yoshiyuki Itsumi, Economic News Department] </F>
  [Text] The decision by the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI] to invoke safeguards under the MFA 
[Multi-Fiber Arrangement] will be a "double-edged sword" for 
this ministry which supposedly upholds free trade. The present 
decision represents a major step toward the actual introduction 
of safeguards. Behind this is the fact that the textile 
industry is seriously distressed by the deluge of imports, and 
the shift in Japanese trade policy in line with efforts to lay 
down economic rules in preparation for the inauguration of the 
World Trade Organization (WTO). 
  However, import curbs may result in further inflation of the 
current account surplus, and foreign countries are certain to 
apply stronger pressure on Japan to reduce its surplus 
drastically. 
  The Western countries have implemented import curbs under 
the 
MFA for more than 20 years. The United States imposes 
restrictions on 80 percent of its imported textile items, while 
the European Union (EU) regulates 50 percent of these products. 
  In contrast, Japan, in consideration of its export products 
creating economic frictions overseas, had not even considered 
conditions for invoking MFA safeguards. 
  In the past, when the Japanese textile industry filed 
dumping 
charges and complained about their difficult position, MITI has 
always dealt with the issue in an ambiguous manner, engaging in 
behind-the-scenes contacts with the trading partners concerned, 
and asking them to implement actual self-restraint in exports. 
  However, with the prospective establishment of the WTO, 
unilateral self-restraint in exports will be banned in principle 
as being a "gray measure." Japan, therefore, recently abolished 
its voluntary restriction on passenger car exports to the United 
States by the end of 31 March. 
  If export restrictions are to be imposed on textile 
products, 
Japan will now have to negotiate with its trading partners, and 
reach a decision based on MFA rules. 
  Already this spring China sent a letter to the minister of 
international trade and industry saying: "In consideration of 
the rapid increase in exports to Japan, we are studying 
appropriate measures," thus indicating it is considering 
voluntary export restrictions. Tough negotiations will now have 
to be conducted to coordinate this with MFA rules. 
  Steps being taken by the textile industry in relation to 
import curbs are also being noted for their effect on efforts to 
determine future policy in this industry which has lost its 
competitiveness.

  [Text] Private-sector representatives and government 
officials clashed hard over the deregulation issue at a meeting 
of the "Working Group on Import Promotion, Improvement of Market 
Access, and Distribution" of the government's Administrative 
Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata) in the prime minister's office on the morning of 18 May. 
The meeting showed very clearly that the private sector wants 
deregulation to be carried out while the bureaucrats want to 
resist it. 
  In the meeting, the private-sector representatives openly 
complained to ministry bureau directors general: "As long as 
government offices act this way, it will be extremely difficult 
to achieve any significant results in deregulation that would be 
acceptable both at home and abroad." 
  The government offices' position in trying to defend vested 
rights showed up so clearly that the people around the prime 
minister were alarmed, saying: "This way, we can never get any 
significant plan adopted by the end of June." 
  The meeting of the day saw five private-sector members of 
the 
group, which included Professor Tajima of Gakushuin University, 
exchange views with director general-level officials from the 
Ministries of Finance, International Trade and Industry, and 
Transport on topics of controls on commodity distribution, 
specifications and permits, and import procedures. It began 
with explanations by government officials on the present 
conditions of regulation and on the reasons for them. Some of 
the officials said: "We will take positive actions [for 
deregulation]"; but most of them showed a negative stand, 
insisting, "Under the given conditions, we cannot decide for 
deregulation." 
  The private-sector group members reacted strongly against 
the 
position of the offices resisting deregulation, some saying, "It 
is truly regrettable that there is no change in the government 
offices' strong attitude toward defending [regulation]. Others 
said: "The economy should be free of control in principle. You 
must change the attitude of defending regulation, citing Japan's 
special circumstances as the reason."

  [Text] Taking advantage of the rapidly appreciated yen, 
industrial circles are increasingly shifting their production 
bases to foreign nations and expanding the import of parts. 
Within auto, electric, and machinery industries, some 
manufacturers are planning to set up a new management system on 
the assumption that the yen's rate against the dollar will be 
100 and lower. While establishing short-term measures, they are 
also trying to cope with the yen's further appreciation by 
taking mid-to-long-range measures such as changing management 
systems in hopes of cutting the trade surplus through the 
expansion of imports and benefiting from the yen appreciation. 
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., in the next two to three 
years starting this fiscal year, plans to increase to 30 percent 
the rate of material purchases from foreign nations. Mitsubishi 
seems to have already increased this rate to 15-16 percent this 
fiscal year. Mitsubishi says that "we will set up a new system 
that can deal with a possible 95 yen to $1" (according to 
Chairman Yotaro Iida) by doubling its purchase of materials 
overseas. 
  NEC Corporation plans to halve its total production costs, 
hopefully by the end of 1995. NEC plans to purchase key parts 
of personal computers from Taiwanese makers. It also plans to 
buy up those parts from its subsidiary company in Hong Kong 
starting this autumn. Underlying Japanese manufacturers' 
increasing procurement of parts from foreign makers is the fact 
that to compete with foreign companies who sell their products 
cheap in Japan by taking advantage of the appreciated yen, it is 
necessary for Japanese companies to lower parts purchase costs 
for their products. 
  IBM Japan said that a loss in exports for the period 
January-December 1993 increased 20 billion yen when compared 
with that of 1992. As of late March, IBM Japan has shifted its 
production base for hard disk units to Thailand as part of its 
measures to improve profit-earning efficiency. It also plans to 
relocate factories for producing other disk units to Malaysia. 
  However, within the industrial circles, there is deep 
concern 
about the possibility that such rapid shifting of production 
bases overseas will lead to industrial "hollowing out" 
(according to Sony Corporation President Norio Ohga). As far as 
the electronic industry is concerned, Aiwa Co., Ltd., which 
specializes in manufacturing audiovisual (AV) products, has 
already shifted most of its production base overseas. It 
produces 70 percent of its total products in its foreign 
factories, and has produced excellent results. This is because 
"it is impossible for Japanese makers to produce all the parts 
of their products in Japan when the employment situation in 
Japan is considered" (according to Sony President Ohga). 
  Since there is no effective measure to deal with the 
appreciated yen, the private sector for its part has no choice 
but to cut the trade surplus as much as possible, which is a 
main cause of the yen appreciation. Since over 50 percent of 
the U.S. deficit in trade with Japan is in the area of 
automobiles and auto parts trade, the Japanese automakers, while 
promoting their own restructuring efforts, have started giving 
serious study to a further increase in imports of finished autos 
from the United States. 
  A senior Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association member 
shows his view, saying, "The yen appreciation this time reflects 
the situation wherein Japan is given the alternative of opening 
its market or allowing the yen to rise further." The Japanese 
say that "Japan will face further pressure unless the auto issue 
is solved." In this way, there is a voice calling for further 
opening of the auto dealers' network to the U.S. makers.

Welfare Annuity Funds: "Stop the Indiscriminate Restriction of 
Corporate Annuity Funds"] 
  [Text] 1. Because of the aging of the population, the 
amount of assets in corporate pension funds has grown steadily, 
exceeding 50 trillion yen. This sizable amount is attracting 
attention from those who are involved in this market. 
  2. There are only two sources of funds for corporate 
pension plans: contributions and earnings from investment. 
Because of the aging of population, pension funds will have to 
rely more on investment earnings in the future. 
  3. To increase investment revenues in the long run, it 
becomes necessary to achieve optimal allocation of assets, 
according to the degree of acceptable risk for each pension 
fund. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a system of risk 
management for each pension fund and to eliminate or ease 
regulations on investment imposed on both investment companies 
and pension funds. 
<H5>  Reaching the "Mature" Stage by 2010 Because of Increased </H5>
Payments of Pension Benefits 
  There has been a rapid expansion in the total amount of 
assets in corporate pension funds, which supplement income for 
salaried employees after their retirement. As of the end of the 
fiscal year 1992, the amount stood at more than 47 trillion yen 
(32 trillion yen of which was in welfare annuity funds, and 15 
trillion yen in funds approved for special tax treatments), 
showing a robust increase of more than 10 percent per year. It 
was the third largest, following 317 trillion yen in the United 
States and 52 trillion yen in England. According to Nomura 
Research Institute, the amount is expected to exceed 100 
trillion yen by the year 2000. 
  Especially noteworthy is the growth of welfare annuity 
funds. 
As of the end of February 1994 there were 1,804 funds with 12 
million participants, representing about a one-third of salaried 
employees at private companies. These funds provide good 
security -- they distribute portion of the nation's welfare 
annuities and are required to pay out more than 30 percent of 
the amount of this distribution. In comparison to other pension 
plans, they are also attractive -- they receive preferential tax 
treatments; contributions to the funds up to a certain level are 
not subject to taxation. These are probably the reasons that the 
corporations have enthusiastically adopted these funds. 
  Assets in the pension funds are invested in stocks and bonds 
in the financial market through trust banks and life insurance 
companies to generate revenues. Therefore, people involved in 
the market have a strong interest in pension funds assets that 
will continue to grow in the future. 
  Eighty-seven percent of the pension funds assets that are 
managed by trust banks are invested in stocks and bonds; 44 
percent in the case of those that are managed by life insurance 
companies (as of the end of the fiscal year 1992). As trust 
banks and life insurance companies share this market by two to 
one, approximately 70 percent plus of the pension assets are 
invested in stocks and bonds. 
  Beginning in the fiscal year 1990, portion of the assets in 
the welfare annuity funds can be managed by investment advisory 
firms. Also, the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds can manage 
the assets with some restrictions. Therefore, much larger 
portion of pension assets will likely be invested in stocks and 
bonds in the future. 
  An important mission for those involved in pension funds is 
to invest in the financial market as profitably as possible 
pension assets that are entrusted to them by corporations and 
participants and thereby to ensure future payments of pension 
benefits. But, as explained in detail in the following, the 
problem is that the current system of investment is not adequate 
to carry out this mission. 
  There are only two sources of revenues for welfare annuity 
funds to pay pension benefits: contributions from corporations 
and participants, and earnings from investing the contributions. 
  In light of the austere condition where corporations are 
carrying out restructuring of their operations, it seems 
difficult to raise the amount of contributions. As 
pension-related costs are estimated to be about 10 percent of 
total wages, raising them further will not be accepted readily. 
  On the other hand, a 1-percent increase in the rate of 
return on investment is in general enough to offset more than a 
20-percent reduction in the amount of contributions. Therefore, 
proper investment will generate a significant amount of assets. 
  As corporate pension funds have become widespread, some of 
them began to reach the "mature stage," where the amount of 
annual payments of pension benefits equals that of annual 
contributions. Most of the funds are expected to reach this 
mature stage by the year 2010, and thus the time is getting 
short for making enough profits from investment. 
<H5>  Problems in the System That Lacks Market Principles </H5>
  In April 1992 a Committee of Professionals was established 
within the Committee of Assets Management at the Federation of 
Welfare Annuity Funds. Its objective was to examine problems in 
assets management, including restrictions on investment, and to 
find solutions to these problems. Committee members included 
Shigeki Sakakibara, professor of management at Kobe University, 
and five other academics who are knowledgeable of pension assets 
and computations. After a year of study, they compiled and 
issued a report entitled "On Revising Restrictions on Investment 
of Pension Assets." 
  The members of the committee and those involved in pension 
funds at that time expressed their candid opinions: "We were 
able to recognize how important market principles are in 
managing pension assets in the securities market, and in what 
respects the series of current restrictions on investment are in 
contradiction to these market principles." 
  They also agreed on another point: "To meet the trust of 
participants and beneficiaries of some 1,800 pension funds, it 
is important for pension funds managers to understand the market 
principles and to carry out their job responsibilities prudently 
and honestly, considering different levels of acceptable risks 
for different funds." 
  In other words, they reached a conclusion that there is no 
other way than to establish a prudent-men's rule (fiduciary 
responsibility) as in the ERISA (Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act) in the United States. This means establishment of 
a system of risk management by pension funds. In addition to 
making basic investment policies (regarding acceptable risks and 
so on), it is necessary to create a comprehensive manual, 
covering how to select institutions that manage pension funds 
and how to evaluate investment performances. 
  Reactions from various circles against the report by the 
Committee of Professionals were not limited to favorable ones 
such as "What they say sounds reasonable in light of the current 
condition." Some opinions were critical: "Restrictions on 
investment are still necessary to ensure the safety of pension 
assets," and "to eliminate restrictions on investment, pension 
funds themselves must streamline their operations first." To 
these opinions, we responded as follows: 
  First, to ensure sound investment and to protect pension 
benefits of beneficiaries, investment activities through trust 
banks and life insurance companies have been restricted since 
the inception of the pension system, using same ratios as 
current allocation of pension assets (i.e., more than 50 percent 
of assets are to be reserved to guarantee the principal, and 
less than 30 percent to be invested in domestic stocks), except 
for assets denominated in foreign currencies, according to the 
notice from chief of the Banking Bureau of the Ministry of 
Finance and per enforcement regulations of the Insurance 
Business Act. However, as almost 30 years have passed since the 
inception of this system, it is not clear how much safety these 
restrictions provide to the pension assets. 
  Also, investment through investment advisory firms that were 
allowed to enter the pension market in 1990 is subject to 
fund-by-fund restrictions (i.e., more than 50 percent of assets 
are to be reserved to guarantee the principal, less than 30 
percent to be invested in domestic stocks, and less than 30 
percent to be invested in assets denominated in foreign 
currencies) as well as a duplicate restriction requiring more 
than 50 percent of assets to be reserved to guarantee the 
principal. Here, it is unclear why the duplicate restriction is 
imposed. These restrictions also deviate from the special 
rulings that came about as a result of the Japan-U.S. talks on 
monetary policies in 1991, easing restrictions on foreign 
investment advisory firms by allowing them to reserve more than 
30 percent of assets to guarantee the principal. 
  As an example of advantages of the restrictions, we often 
hear the following opinion: "Owing to restrictions on 
investment, valuation losses of pension assets were only about 
10 percent even when the stock market hit the bottom after the 
collapse of the bubble economy." We want to respond to this by 
saying, "This does not provide evidence that restrictions on 
investment contribute to risk management of each individual 
fund. In light of the acceptable risks, profits could have been 
made if pension assets were allocated more to stocks than the 
regulated ratio (30 percent) dictated. Therefore, they 
[restrictions on investment] are actually robbing income 
opportunities from the funds." 
  The biggest drawback of investment restrictions is that they 
are weakening the sense of responsibility by both funds and 
investment firms over risk management. For example, let's assume 
that a fund at a high stage of maturity allocated its assets to 
stocks up to the upper limit of the regulated ratio when it 
should have reduced the amount of such investment in stocks. As 
a result, the fund may incur valuation losses due to declining 
stock prices, and pension financing that has already become 
tight due to the advanced stage of maturity may deteriorate 
further. 
  In August 1993 the Federation of Welfare Annuity Funds asked 
some of the major financial institutions to which it entrusts 
management of its pension assets how they thought of 
restrictions according to types of investment institutions. All 
of the eight trust banks and eight life insurance companies that 
were questioned replied, "Regulations are needed at least until 
pension funds themselves streamline their risk management 
systems." 
  In contrast, all of the 16 investment advisory firms that 
entered the market in April 1990 and three foreign-owned trust 
banks replied differently: "Regulations should be eliminated as 
soon as possible." The difference in opinions seems to show that 
regulations are business-related issues of these investment 
institutions, rather than safety issues for pension assets. 
  Those involved in pension funds strongly hope for earliest 
possible elimination of investment regulations so that pension 
funds with established risk management systems can select 
investment institutions on their own according to their own 
investment policies. 
  The objective in managing pension assets is to maximize 
profits under the level of risk acceptable to each individual 
fund so that pension liabilities will continue to be met in the 
future. The acceptable level of risk varies, depending on the 
stage of maturity of each individual fund as well as the 
employer's ability to contribute to the fund, that is, the 
profitability of the business. Therefore, it is not something to 
be regulated. 
<H5>  Application of Regulations According to Funds Ability </H5>
  However, it was necessary to reconfirm a consensus for 
pension funds in dealing with the issue at present. This point 
was resolved in early December 1993 when the Committee on Assets 
Management reached a decision: "For the time being, we maintain 
investment regulations at the funds level, with exception of 
those funds that have an ability to manage risks and a high 
level of risk tolerance." 
  Those of us who are involved in pension funds understand 
that 
to demand easing of regulations, it is imperative for us to 
establish a system of risk management (prudent-men's rule) on 
pension funds. To this end, we are preparing an investment 
manual in our department and are planning to distribute it to 
all pension funds at the beginning of the fiscal year 1994.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Hiroko Ota, Osaka University visiting </F>
professor, and Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni and Associates; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] What should be done to eliminate Japan's 
current account surplus? The problem isn't one that can be 
solved by expanding imports. Rather, a reduction in the surplus 
will come about when there has been economic structural 
reform. 
<H5>  Why Trade Surplus Continues </H5>
  [Akio Mikuni] It is very difficult for borrower and creditor 
countries to settle their accounts with each other. This can be 
seen quite clearly, for example, in the case of automobiles. 
Japan's production capacity far exceeds domestic demand while, 
in the United States, production capacity is insufficient to 
meet domestic demand and cars have to be imported. As a result, 
Japan has a current surplus. To settle its accounts, the United 
States must sell a lot of cars to Japan and repay its debt with 
the proceeds from its sales. But, here, we seem to come up 
against a dilemma. Since it has excess capacity, Japan can't 
very well import more than it does. In the United States, 
production levels are so low as to make it necessary for 
Americans to import cars, so unlike Japan, they can't very well 
export more. 
  People often argue that everything would be all right if 
only 
the United States were paying its bills. That Americans keep 
buying cars from Japan means their manufacturers haven't 
increased their production capacity or their labor force 
sufficiently to offset the need for imports, but that situation 
of course won't last forever. 
  [Hiroko Ota] In my view, the current-account surplus itself 
isn't a problem. 
  If one were to say there is a problem, it's mainly on the 
side of the country with the current-account deficit and in its 
having steadily built up a loan balance that keeps getting 
bigger in proportion to its GNP. The responsibility for that is 
on the debtor's side. It's a problem for the debtor-country to 
solve. 
  Textbooks would say there is no direct connection between 
the 
trade or export-import imbalance and the current-account 
surplus. In other words, in an open economy under the floating 
rate system, the exchange rate goes down and there's an 
adjustment that way when the balance tilts too much toward 
imports. Looked at from a long-range perspective, I think the 
surplus in the current account can be explained in terms of the 
balance between domestic savings and investments. 
  Because of Japan's current surplus, it is often said we are 
exporting unemployment, but here, too, a strong connection 
between the current-account balance and employment can't be 
substantiated. Rather, a more important factor is the labor 
market, and I don't think a current-account deficit is the 
reason that unemployment is increasing. Nor do existing data 
substantiate such claims. 
  Another argument that is often made is that the growth of 
Japan's surplus is robbing the United States of effective 
demand. Here, too, if we look at the problem from a 
mid-to-long-term perspective, I don't think that argument can be 
made. In other words, to stimulate effective demand and 
influence the GNP is only a short-term approach to the problem. 
The only way to correct the current-account imbalance, I think, 
is to change the ratio between savings and investments. 
  Actually, what is happening is that the outflow of capital 
from Japan is financing U.S. investments and thus creating 
employment. So, I don't think we can necessarily say Japan's 
current surplus is hurting effective demand in the United States 
or increasing unemployment there. 
  [Mikuni] If the same methods that we use to analyze 
financial 
statements were used to analyze national economies, various 
perspectives would emerge, just as they do in the case of firms. 
So, I think it's quite valid to argue in terms of the 
savings-investment balance when considering the current account. 
  Only, I wonder if we can really say current surpluses don't 
pose a problem for creditor nations? For example, Japan has been 
extending a lot of credit to other countries. But that credit 
isn't worth as much with the yen's appreciation. By continuing 
to have a surplus, a creditor nation will see its currency 
valued upwards to a large extent and will suffer a loss in real 
terms. 
  When the current account balance continues to be in surplus, 
the exchange rate changes under the floating rate system, and 
the trade balance moves toward equilibrium. Such changes in the 
exchange rate are harmful to profits, and manufacturers quit 
making products and quit exporting them. Conversely, the import 
industry benefits by seeing higher profit ratios, so it imports 
more. Naturally, when this situation continues, the gap between 
imports and exports tends to narrow, and the surplus is 
eliminated. In Japan's case, however, this mechanism isn't 
entirely working. 
  There are two reasons. One is that Japanese industry has to 
persist and keep on producing. Given its system of lifetime 
employment, Japanese industry can't very well just start 
dismissing workers. Nor can it do away with its plants and 
facilities. In any case, what happens is that existing 
production capacity is maintained and manufacturers take 
whatever opportunity they can to increase exports. 
  The second reason is that, when profits are suffering in a 
country where the financial capital market is operating to some 
extent according to the market principle, rising fund-raising 
costs will act as a brake. In Japan's case, the Ministry of 
Finance will not let a single bank fail. Nor will main banks let 
[client] companies fail. In short, things are set up so that 
large enterprises don't go bankrupt. The environment makes it 
easier, in other words, to avoid the kind of situation where 
fundraising costs go up when corporate profits are down, and 
production therefore has to be cut back. 
  [Ota] I agree that part of the current-account surplus 
reflects a structural problem. 
  Only, I don't think the Maekawa Report was right in its 
approach; in other words, I don't think it was right to consider 
the surplus itself the problem and to make it the target for 
macroeconomic policy, do you? 
  Expanding imports in the long term will not reduce the 
current surplus. I agree it's necessary to expand imports, but 
for a different reason. Imports should be expanded--not only to 
raise the level of world trade, but also, for example, to raise 
the quality of life at home. 
  [Mikuni] I won't go so far as to say a continuing surplus is 
itself particularly a problem. But when we look at the profit 
ratio of the manufacturing industry while that surplus is 
growing and accumulating, we see that operating profits relative 
to sales for sectors heavily based on exports--for example, of 
automobiles and electrical products--have been falling sharply 
and, as a result of declining net receipts from exports due to 
the stronger yen, companies are no longer showing a profit. 
  For high-level growth, a steady growth in production volume 
is probably necessary. But high-level growth has become an aim 
in and of itself. As a result, exports are extremely important 
for them if they are to maintain their existing rates of 
operation. Therefore, they export. No one considers such 
profitless "busy work" strange any more. 
  Another thing is that, when people import products, they are 
usually profitable, but we have quit importing those things. In 
addition to these two "absurdities" we also have an 
"unreasonably strong yen." 
  [Ota] Certainly, there's an element of self-inflicted injury 
here. The trade surplus and yen appreciation are indications of 
that, and in that sense, I think the current imbalance is a 
problem. Another big problem is how Japan, as a creditor nation, 
allocates funds on a macro-level. 
  As high as our savings ratio is, it doesn't translate itself 
adequately into a higher quality of life or into questions 
concerning Japan's future development. Rather, not a small part 
of these savings is going overseas as credit. This credit is 
necessary, but at a time when our social infrastructure is so 
poor, we see overseas credit holdings growing at a faster pitch 
than efforts to improve social capital. 
  Moreover, foreign credit holdings are themselves exposed to 
various investment risks, including the risk of exchange rate 
fluctuations, so valuable savings intended for our aging 
population are not being turned toward building up our "stock" 
at home. Nor are they being linked to the creation of an 
information and communications network or an industrial base for 
the future. The fact that these savings are not connected to the 
future wealth of Japan or its development, I think, indicates a 
structural problem. 
  [Mikuni] Yes. Before taking a lot of money overseas, we 
ought 
to look into whether more investments aren't needed at home. 
Most important, housing investments haven't really been 
seriously given any thought. 
  Fortunate Circumstances 
  [Ota] Americans are criticizing Japan, saying that Japan's 
closed markets are the main reason for our current-account 
surplus, but theoretically that argument is flawed. 
  It's possible, by increasing trade, to influence the 
current-account balance temporarily, but the exchange rate will 
change. In other words, when imports to Japan increase, the yen 
tends to go down in value, with the result that exports are then 
increased, offsetting the increase in imports. In the long term, 
because of changes in price levels and the exchange rate, there 
is almost no effect at all. 
  Even in the short run, because of changes in the exchange 
rate, there will not be as much effect on the current surplus as 
one might expect. That would be even more the case, I think we 
can say, if we were to increase imports in specific areas like 
the Americans want. It would have only a very limited effect and 
not have any influence, in macro terms, on the current-account 
surplus. So, it's hard to justify the U.S. demands, and I really 
can't understand why they are being made. 
  [Mikuni] The aim of U.S. policy is neither clear nor easily 
understood. 
  Another reason--which is different from yours--is that, even 
if imports were increased to some extent, that in itself 
wouldn't be enough to reduce the surplus sufficiently to affect 
our trade or current-account balances given the size of our 
surplus. It would be very hard, I would think, to reduce our 
surplus without reducing our exports. What effect that will have 
on the macroeconomic side would require a separate analysis, 
however. 
  [Ota] I have a feeling that various frustrations--such as 
the 
perceived lack of transparency in Japan's markets, our 
certification system, etc.--have come to a head and are finding 
their outlet in the current-account imbalance. But, I do think 
expanding imports and easing regulations are, in themselves, 
goals we're going to have to aim for. 
  [Mikuni] Japan's current production capacity is the highest 
in the world. We have built up a capacity that far exceeds 
domestic demand. With the end of the Cold War, the United States 
is shifting from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. As 
that shift occurs, we will probably be seeing Americans 
importing fewer durable consumer goods from Japan. With the 
United States moving in this direction, the Japanese economy 
will have to move seriously toward increasing domestic demand. 
This is probably what the Americans believe. From Japan's 
perspective, too, I would think it is necessary to attend to 
various unfinished business and expand domestic demand while 
supporting the world economy to some extent. 
  [Ota] The Japanese are very fortunate right now in that what 
they have been wanting--to build the social infrastructure and 
to improve their standard of living and lower the cost of goods 
by way of more imports--are now goals they can pursue while, at 
the same time, easing foreign criticisms of Japan. 
  [Mikuni] So, the idea of making the shift--of moving in a 
direction where Japan can renew its industries and technology, 
raise its standard of living, and thus forge new products from 
new domestic demand--the shift, in other words, from a copycat 
economy to a creative one is really the most important thing, 
isn't it? 
  [Ota] Yes, I agree. Rather than looking for solutions to the 
present situation by simply responding to foreign pressure, 
Japan has to put its energies into restructuring its enterprises 
and its domestic market. Probably two things are required of 
Japan. Since Japan's surplus is actually being put to good use 
in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, one of those 
roles is to provide funds. The other is to provide a large 
market for other economies. It is particularly in this role as a 
consumer that you seem to be addressing yourself, and that, I 
think, will create the seeds for the future development of the 
Japanese economy. 
  [Mikuni] Yes. So, the question that's become of the utmost 
importance is how we are to expand this kind of consumer demand. 
  Surplus Reduction as an Outcome 
  [Ota] I think it was a mistake for the Maekawa Report to say 
that the current-account imbalance was itself a crisis and then 
set it up as a policy objective. 
  Of course, if we looked around us at the time, we could see 
that the U.S. debt had grown and had reached critical 
proportions relative to its GNP. Admittedly, the situation then 
was even worse than it is today. 
  Only, it is very important to understand and examine where 
the problem lies with regard to the current-account imbalance. 
If it reflects a problem in the domestic situation, then the 
policy objective should be to find a solution to that problem. 
  In fact, many of those who took part in the Hiraiwa Report 
suggested taking the opposite approach from the one taken in the 
Maekawa Report. In other words, rather than thinking that the 
current-account surplus had to be reduced and using that means 
to improve our quality of life, they advocated an approach which 
would first tackle the structural problems that exist at home. 
In effect, that approach would then result in the reduction of 
the current-account surplus, it was thought. I would agree, and 
I think we expected to see these views reflected in the Hiraiwa 
Report. 
  In the end, the weakest part of the report was the route 
linking views on the current-account surplus to domestic 
structural problems. 
  Particularly, in questions concerning the current-account 
surplus and structural reform, what is important is whether one 
chooses to get the money to improve the social infrastructure 
through taxes or through government bonds. Since the 
current-account balance is what is left when you subtract the 
fiscal deficit from the savings-investment balance, I think an 
important route to take in order to improve the quality of life 
and reduce the current-account surplus is to issue government 
bonds and improve the social infrastructure. Among other things, 
because the Ministry of Finance was extremely opposed to the 
idea, that route wasn't suggested. 
  [Mikuni] Depending on whom you talk with, you get different 
views and ways of thinking about the current-account surplus. In 
Japan's case, however, I think the biggest factor [behind the 
surplus] is that Japanese industries have built up their 
production capacity out of proportion to domestic demand. 
  About 20 years ago, I remember reading a paper written by 
Osamu Shimomura. He was arguing from the perspective of 
"comparative advantage"--if you can get something good but 
cheaper as an import, then that was the way to go, he was saying. 
  In the Maekawa and Hiraiwa reports, the idea is to make 
choices based on rational economic principles, choices about 
which things to do and which things not to do. Like a gardener, 
you have to decide which trees and which branches need pruning 
and which should be left to grow in order to have a beautiful 
garden full of well-shaped shrubs and trees. 
  In Japan's case, the process of making such decisions--I'd 
call it allocating resources by deductive reasoning--has been to 
have some kind of goal and then for government to lead the way 
in reaching that goal or for government and the private sector 
to be as one in allocating managerial resources. 
  However, with that kind of setup, it is very difficult to 
make choices--to decide, in terms of policy, which industries 
will remain or which enterprises will survive or how production 
capacity is to be reduced. In both the Maekawa and Hiraiwa 
reports, the problem is in deciding what to do in order to get 
specific results. 
  New Form of Investments 
  [Mikuni] Everything is macroeconomic policy these days, and 
to some extent we can expect to see a recovery. 
  But it seems to me that, with the yen as high as it is, 
enterprises, especially those in the manufacturing sector, are 
no longer earning profits from their export-related activities. 
Consequently, I think plant and equipment investments are going 
to continue to be stagnant. To make the shift toward increased 
demand, then, we need policy that will give a serious boost to 
housing investments. 
  As the United States is doing, this means recognizing the 
interest on housing loans as a necessary expense. If the full 
amount can be deducted from income, people can buy a home or 
build a bigger one. The spread effect from this will be quite 
significant. 
  Again, it's important of course to save money for when our 
society grows older. But there are advantages, for example, in 
building the kind of houses now that will last another 50 to 100 
years. It would mean no more housing will have to be built when, 
in another 20 or 30 years, there's even a greater proportion of 
elderly in Japan and a much smaller productive population. So, 
in this sense, too, such investments would be very logical. 
  Until now, macroeconomic policy has been formulated in an 
economy which, if anything, has been running in a "catch-up and 
overtake" mode and has been an effort to somehow bring about a 
business recovery. But nothing has been done yet about 
structural reform. I think that may have been a major factor in 
the ineffectiveness, in the true sense, of economic policy and 
stimulus measures until now. 
  [Ota] At this point, an income tax cut or policy to 
stimulate 
effective demand alone probably won't do any good. Even in the 
long term, rather than redistribute resources by way of an 
income tax cut in order to stimulate already ample private 
consumption, I think we should focus on the poverty of our 
social infrastructure. 
  I think we need to put our energies into this 
infrastructure, 
and fundamentally reconsider our basic plans for public works 
investments, not only in terms of amounts, but also in terms of 
content and the system for carrying these plans out. 
  Since the yen's appreciation in the second half of the 
1980's, we have been trying to expand domestic demand through 
monetary policy, and it was this that led to the bubble economy. 
  Now is the time to put public funds into greater action. For 
the current-account surplus to have grown to the extent it has 
means that there is now much broader leeway to expand fiscal 
expenditures. So, this is the time when we can give our 
attention seriously to issuing construction bonds and improving 
the social infrastructure. This is our last chance to do so. 
  But rather than a macroeconomic perspective, policy has 
strongly reflected the views of the Ministry of Finance; namely, 
its desire not to severely restrict the budget-making process 
and also to keep restrictions on future budgets to a minimum. 
Thus, needed macroeconomic policy has not been adopted. 
  [Mikuni] In the case of public works investments, here, too, 
we can see that the path which has been taken so far has 
reflected certain value judgments; namely, the importance of 
efficiently building up industry. 
  For example, in large foreign cities like London or New 
York, 
places with the best scenery are reserved for residential use 
and for hotels. In Japan, offices are found on those sites. 
Here, too, we need to change our values. 
  [Ota] For starters, we need to be able to change our way of 
doing things. We've taken public works investments and housing 
investments as policies to stimulate the economy, and that has 
distorted the way things really ought to be done and haven't 
produced results commensurate with the investments. 
  Rather than measures simply to stimulate the economy, we 
should, for example, be trying to improve our social 
infrastructure (this term needs to be defined more strictly), 
especially in terms of building the foundation for future 
industry, whatever form that takes, and those things that are 
related to our daily lives. 
  [Mikuni] "Future industry" sounds simple enough, but 
actually 
there is no consensus as to what future technology or the future 
form of industry will be. How do you make new industries and new 
technology possible? In the final analysis, only those things 
that the consumer supports are going to survive. 
  Relaxing Regulations Is Also Necessary 
  [Mikuni] Which is to say, the most fortunate aspect of the 
Japanese economy right now is that individual financial assets 
total 1,000 trillion yen. Its production capacity is also quite 
formidable. If in such a country domestic demand is expanded, it 
is quite possible to see new technologies and new products 
developing and those developments having an impact on industry. 
It is of the utmost importance, I think, to somehow realize this 
potential. 
  [Ota] Yes. And for that purpose, it is very important to 
relax regulations. We should have more faith in the strength of 
the market and government should try as much as possible not to 
intervene. Another thing, whenever I visit a university, it 
strikes me how shabby the research facilities are. We also have 
to build up our research and development infrastructure. And, 
like President Clinton's information highway, we too will have 
to build an information and communications network. 
  To do these sorts of things is to effectively utilize our 
national savings as an objective of macroeconomic policy, and to 
relax regulations and stimulate domestic investments. In short, 
it is to aim for the expansion of domestic demand and reduce the 
conditions that make it necessary for people to save so much. 
These things will be linked to a reduction of the 
current-account surplus. 
  We are in a very favorable position to be able to implement 
macroeconomic policy objectives. Restrictions due to the labor 
shortage have eased up, and fortunately, land prices have come 
down. So, we're in the best position now to be able to implement 
them. If the Hiraiwa Report and others had clearly indicated 
that structural reform would have an impact, in terms of 
outcome, on reducing the current-account surplus, then perhaps 
the United States and Japan would have been able to come to a 
better understanding or find a better resolution to their 
disagreements. 
  [Mikuni] In effect, we have to move in a new direction and 
change the way we have been doing things. In a sense, it is the 
market which will define that "new direction," but we have to be 
ready by creating managerial resources that are more fluid. 
  Probably one of those ways is to relax regulations, but it 
is 
also necessary to improve the fluidity of things like the labor 
market, the financial capital market, and our product market. 
  In order to have the kind of system that gives play to the 
market function, we have to make those market "rules" much 
clearer and try to maintain them. Of course, such a system 
doesn't give us the right to act arbitrarily.

<F P=106> [By editorial writer Ataru Odagawa] </F>
  [Text] The following is the summary of remarks by DPRK's 
(North Korean) President Kim Il-song in the 21 April interview 
given to Ms. Mun Myong-cha: 
  We have never dreamt of a war. (Regarding North Korean 
delegate's threat to turn Seoul into a "sea of flames") I was 
surprised at the remark when I heard it. Later, I received a 
formal report that the words had been blurted out in 
counterarguments to South Korean delegates who had gotten on our 
delegates' nerves. 
  South Korea and the United States once said we already have 
nuclear bombs without any proof, and now they say we have the 
capability to produce them. They are just trying to corner us 
with their groundless claims. 
  If we have such a capability, we would not bother to hold a 
dialogue with the United States. At the negotiations with the 
United States last year, our delegate proposed: "If you have 
suspicions against us, please help us shift all nuclear reactors 
to light-water reactors. Since we do not have funds to carry 
out the plan, we need financial aid or loans." In response, the 
U.S. delegate agreed to do that. Although we both are supposed 
to implement the agreement, the suspicion is becoming an 
obstacle to the fulfillment of the agreement. 
  If we really have nuclear weapons, we would have to conduct 
nuclear experiments; however, we have no place to test a nuclear 
weapon. Also, we do not have any target against which to use 
such a weapon. They probably believe we are developing the 
weapon to confront our compatriots, but that would never happen. 
Why do we have to have a nuclear weapon while we have no place 
to use it? 
  If we show the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
everything they want to see, they will say they have doubts 
about other places that they want to see, and more places, and 
this attitude will continue. While the IAEA says they have 
doubts about our military facilities, inspections of military 
bases are beyond its authority. North and South Korea have a 
bilateral arms reduction accord. If mutual arms reduction is 
carried out in line with the accord, we can show everything, 
including military facilities, to each other. 
  Since the truce (of the Korean war), we have been under what 
are actually comprehensive economic sanctions by the economic 
sphere of the United States. What further sanctions can be 
imposed beyond those we have been subjected to? I feel like 
saying once, go ahead and try. 
  China has never tried to apply pressures on us. We are not a 
vassal state of China. 
  I was deeply impressed with (ROK) President Kim Yong-sam's 
inauguration address in February 1993. He stated "even the best 
friendly nation cannot stand closer than compatriots," and this 
is my longstanding opinion, too. In response to his address, I 
hammered out a 10-point guideline (for Korea's reunification). 
However, President Kim recently said we would be isolated unless 
the nuclear issue is resolved. I just do not understand why he 
made such a remark.

<F P=106> [From ASAHI SHIMBUN 19 May Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] DRPK (North Korean) President Kim Il-song recently 
gave an interview to Korean-American journalist Mun Myong-cha, 
in which he said that the United States and the ROK are "trying 
to corner" North Korea on the nuclear issue, and strongly 
criticized moves to get the UN Security Council to impose 
economic sanctions. Kim expressed a desire to resume high-level 
negotiations between the United States and North Korea. He also 
indicated a willingness to reopen negotiations with Japan on the 
normalization of relations, saying: "No matter who the prime 
minister is, the door is always open." 
  The interview was conducted at the presidential palace in 
Pyongyang on 21 April. Moon revealed the contents of the 
interview to an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo before he 
actually publishes the story in U.S. ASIA NEWS, for which he 
works as chief editor. 
  Kim said during the interview that if North Korea has the 
capability to manufacture nuclear arms, it would not bother to 
hold a dialogue with the United States. He thus reiterated his 
denial of allegations about the DPRK's development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  Kim also disclosed that during high-level U.S.-DPRK talks 
last year, the United States pledged to provide assistance, 
including financial aid, to help the DPRK shift to light-water 
reactors which produce very little plutonium. This is believed 
to be an indication of the DRPK's bargaining position as it 
tries to eliminate suspicions about its development of nuclear 
arms and seeks economic reconstruction through negotiations with 
the United States. 
  Normalization talks between Japan and the DPRK have been 
suspended since the eighth round held in 1992. Kim reportedly 
stressed that "whatever happens to the Japanese political 
situation, our position remains unchanged." Both sides consider 
the joint communique on early establishment of diplomatic 
relations (in 1990) between the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
and Social Democratic of Japan, and the Korean Workers' Party to 
be practically null and void once the non-LDP coalition 
government came to power. 
  Kim's remarks at the interview are seen as an attempt to 
prevent the DPRK's isolation over the nuclear issue, and to 
undercut cooperation between Japan, the United States, and the 
ROK. However, recently, there have also been behind-the-scenes 
moves on the part of North Korea to urge Japan to resume 
normalization talks. The Japanese Government will now have to 
seek ways to resolve this situation while also taking 
developments in the U.S.-DPRK dialogue into consideration.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN 19 May Morning Edition; by </F>
correspondent Shiwahiko Machida] 
  [Text] Vienna, 18 May -- Commenting on the issue of 
replacing fuel rods at an experimental atomic reactor in 
Yongbyon, North Korea, on 18 May, an official at the North 
Korean Embassy in Vienna said: "Inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be able to take 
samples of spent fuel when the fuel rods are replaced if 
U.S.-North Korea talks are resumed." 
  It is the first time that a North Korean official has 
definitely hinted at the possibility of IAEA inspectors taking 
samples of spent fuel at the experimental atomic reactor. 
  The North Korean official told a MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter 
about the possibility on 18 May. So far, North Korea has 
refused to allow IAEA inspectors to take the samples of spent 
fuel to determine if North Korea has diverted uranium for 
military purposes. North Korea appears to have begun to soften 
its stand on the issue now that the United States has taken up 
the issue seriously. 
  Asked to comment on reports that "a substantially large 
number of fuel rods" have been replaced at the experimental 
atomic reactor, the North Korean diplomat said: "I do not know 
how many fuel rod have been replaced."

  [Text] The South Korea National Democratic Front [SKNDF] 
Central Committee issued on 14 May a statement concerning the 
discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium, which is enough to 
manufacture nine nuclear bombs, at a plutonium plant in Japan. 
The full text of the statement is as follows: 
  Seventy kilograms of plutonium, enough for manufacturing 
nine 
nuclear bombs, has recently been discovered in Japan's plutonium 
plant for developing [words indistinct] nuclear fuel. 
  All countries of the world as well as the international 
community are now greatly concerned about and angry with the 
detection of the large amount of plutonium warding off 
international surveillance in Japan that claims to be a model in 
accepting so-called international nuclear inspections. 
  The discovery of as much as 70 kilograms of plutonium is 
vivid proof showing that Japan has secretly produced and 
stockpiled a huge amount of plutonium while accelerating its 
nuclear armament under the cloak of peaceful nuclear 
development, and has actually used the accumulated plutonium for 
military purposes. 
  At the same time, it clearly proves that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] surveillance system is, in nature, 
not aimed at the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, but no 
more than a means of pressure and aggression that enables 
nuclear states, including the United States, to realize their 
ambition to dominate nonnuclear states. 
  In order to turn the attention of Asia and the rest of the 
countries concerned about Japan's nuclear armament to North 
Korea, the Japanese authorities are playing the role of shock 
brigade drumming up the United States' anti-North Korea nuclear 
commotion. They are accelerating their full-fledged nuclear 
armament behind the curtain of the (?commotion) over the 
so-called suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development. 
  In fact, there have been open attempts in Japan to 
politicize 
and legalize Japan's nuclear armament while opposing and 
distorting the peace law that prohibits the possession of 
nuclear weapons. Even absurd remarks stressing the 
unnecessariness of the three principles for denuclearization are 
heard. 
  Japan began the full-fledged development of nuclear weapons 
in the 1950s and has now become an unquestionable nuclear power 
[myongsil sangbuhan heak taeguk] with fissionable nuclear 
materials, the technology for manufacturing them, and the means 
of nuclear transportation. 
  Japan has strongly pushed ahead with the ambitious plan to 
secure highly-condensed uranium and plutonium and has 
accumulated 26 tonnes of plutonium. The amount of plutonium 
stockpiled by Japan will reach some 100 tonnes in the early 21st 
century. 
  Japan is now building a nuclear waste reprocessing plant to 
extract plutonium from the enormous amount of spent nuclear fuel 
used by 38 reactors being in operation at the Nikaimura nuclear 
complex. The plant, which will be completed soon, will produce 
eight tonnes of plutonium a year. This means that Japan will 
obtain enough plutonium to manufacture more than 1,000 [word 
indistinct] nuclear bombs a day. 
  Japan's ambition to secure a huge amount of plutonium is 
well 
shown by the fact that it abruptly began in April to operate 
Monju, a fast-breeding reactor installed in Tsuruga, Fukui 
Prefecture, running counter to the worldwide trend of opposing 
fast-breeding reactors. 
  In addition, Japan succeeded in the test firing of the 
homemade long-range No. 1 F-2 Rocket early this year to pave the 
way for its possession of strategic nuclear missiles. 
  Japan's nuclear armament and its attempt to become a nuclear 
power belong to today's reality, not to tomorrow's [word 
indistinct]. 
  The discovery of the concealed 70 kilograms of plutonium is 
indeed a proof of Japan's frenzy in nuclear development. 
  The SKNDF Central Committee sternly punishes and denounces, 
along with the peace-loving popular masses of the world, the 
Japanese authorities' maneuver to produce, stockpile, and 
secretly bring in the awful nuclear weapons that will drop on 
our nation and mankind, with the tacit permission from the 
United States and the IAEA. 
  At the same time, in the name of the nation, the SKNDF 
Central Committee sternly protests the nation-selling Kim 
Yong-sam group that is pushing ahead with its full-pledged 
nuclear weapon development in collusion with the Japanese 
reactionary authorities, behind the curtain of the U.S. 
anti-North Korea nuclear commotion to destroy North Korea, where 
the fellow countrymen live. 
  The Japanese nuclear armament (?threatens) peace in Asia and 
the world. Japan's maneuver to become a nuclear power is 
increasing the nuclear war danger on the Korean peninsula. 
  Despite these facts, the United States and the IAEA are 
maneuvering to pressure North Korea by fabricating and 
amplifying the suspicion over the fictitious nuclear development 
of North Korea, while ignoring Japan's nuclear armament, whose 
true nature has been revealed. This is a significant 
infringement upon the international justice, peace, and 
impartiality. 
  We expect that governments, political parties, and 
organizations of countries in the world as well as international 
organizations, which love justice and peace and pursue common 
prosperity and development, will deter Japan's ambition of 
nuclear armament and will even more broadly organize and round 
off the struggle to establish a new order for controlling 
nuclear development based on international impartiality. 
  The SKNDF will continue to strongly wage the antiwar and 
antinuclear peace movement to cope with Japan's nuclear armament 
maneuver that threatens the Korean peninsula, Asia, and (?the 
whole world) and with the anti-North Korea nuclear commotion by 
the United States and international reactionary forces [kukche 
pandong seryok] aimed at making the Korean peninsula the victim 
of a nuclear war.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) 
issued a statement on May 14 concerning the recent discovery of 
much plutonium in Japan, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  The statement said: 
  The discovery of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan is patent proof 
that the Japanese authorities, while accelerating nuclear 
armament behind the curtain of "peaceful nuclear development" 
for scores of years, have produced and stockpiled a large amount 
of plutonium in secrecy and are diverting it for military 
purposes in actuality. 
  This also clearly proves that the surveillance system of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is not mechanism for 
nuclear non-proliferation but a tool of pressure and aggression 
allowing the United States and other nuclear-weapon states to 
dominate non-nuclear weapon states. 
  With a view to diverting to the North the attention of Asia 
and the rest of the world concerned over Japan's nuclear 
armament, the Japanese authorities are playing the role of a 
shock brigade in the anti-DPRK nuclear racket of the United 
States and promoting their nuclear armament in real earnest 
behind the big scene made over the "suspicion of the nuclear 
development" by the North. 
  Japan's nuclear armament is a cancer in the peace of Asia 
and 
the rest of the world. 
  The danger of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula is growing 
due to Japan's efforts to become a nuclear power. 
  Nevertheless, the United States and the IAEA are kicking up 
a 
pressure campaign against the North over its "nuclear suspicion" 
while closing their eyes to Japan's undisguised nuclear 
armament. This is a grave violation of international justice, 
peace and impartiality. 
  We express the hope that the governments, political parties 
and organisations of all countries that love justice and peace 
and pursue common prosperity and development as well as 
international organisations will more extensively organise the 
struggle to check Japan's ambitious nuclear armament and 
establish a new order of nuclear control based on international 
impartiality. 
  Our Hanminjon will in the future, too, wage a strong 
anti-war, anti-nuke peace movement against Japan's nuclear 
armament threatening peace and human existence in the Korean 
peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world and against the 
anti-North nuclear intrigues of the United States and 
international reactionary forces intended to put the Korean 
peninsula on the altar of a nuclear war.

<F P=106> ["Crafty Ruse"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Ichiro Ozawa and other 
ultra-rightists of Japan are openly making haste with the 
completion of legal preparations for military expansion 
overseas, raising a terrific hue and cry over "a security 
crisis" with regard to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stated recently that 
the government was examining "emergency legislative 
arrangements" for the reaction of the "self-defense forces" in 
"the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, taking issue 
with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. And the general director 
of the defense agency and the chief cabinet secretary also said 
that practical preparations for "security emergency legislative 
arrangements" had been completed by and large. 
  The "security crisis" advertised by the Japanese rulers is a 
sheer fiction. No one threatens or intends to attack Japan 
today. 
  Their outcries over "a security crisis" are a sophism for 
justifying their hostile policy against the DPRK and their 
scheme to stage a military comeback to Korea. 
  In actuality, the reactionary ruling circles of Japan, 
peddling the ware of "security crisis," are seeking to establish 
"an emergency system" and "a wartime mobilisation system" 
through the "security emergency legislative arrangements" 
against "an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula and 
legally gratify their desire of military reinvasion. 
  Japan has made all military and material preparations for 
reinvasion. What remains to be done is to create a legal 
foundation allowing it. 
  In advertising "a security crisis" over the "nuclear issue" 
of the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries also intend to prop up 
the unstable present government by sidetracking the attention of 
the Japanese people. 
  The militarists manipulated by the force of Ichiro Ozawa are 
wringing their own necks in the suicidal act of getting 
overheated in the reinvasion moves while crying for the 
establishment of "an emergency system." The Asian people are 
highly vigilant against the reinvasion moves of the Japanese 
right-wing reactionaries. 
  The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters should face the 
reality squarely and give up their foolish attempt to repeat the 
past crimes.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
The Osaka prefectural headquarters of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) held a roundtable 
conversation with Japanese media on May 16. 
  Present on the occasion were the head of the local branch 
office of the Japanese JIJI press, chief editors of the Osaka 
head offices of ASAHI SHIMBUN, MAINICHI SHIMBUN, NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN and SANKEI SHIMBUN and representatives of the NHK, the 
KYODO News Service and YOMIURI SHIMBUN. 
  Speaking at the roundtable, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of 
the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and chairman of the 
Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, said the question 
of "suspected nuclear development" of the DPRK has been reported 
by Japanese media in a way contrary to facts, thereby hampering 
the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and, 
furthermore, the denuclearization of Northeast Asia. "The DPRK 
has neither intention nor capacity to develop nuclear weapons," 
he stressed. 
  Calling attention to the unreasonable search of the Osaka 
organization of Chongnyon by the Japanese police, assaults on 
Korean students in Japan and rampant reports and tones inciting 
the consciousness of national chauvinism, he demanded an 
immediate halt to such acts.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
overseas headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) issued a statement May 16 denouncing 
the United States and its followers for pushing the situation on 
the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  The statement charged that the United States and the South 
Korean puppet clique [words indistinct] "nuclear issue". It 
also denounced the Japanese authorities who, taking advantage of 
this, are trying to justify the troop dispatch of their 
"Self-Defence Forces" to the Korean peninsula with much ado 
about "emergency legislative arrangements." 
  The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon will devote its all 
to the struggle for the great, close unity of the nation, 
joining force with all the fellow countrymen, the statement 
said, calling upon the 70 million fellow countrymen in the North 
and the South of Korea and abroad to turn out as one to repulse 
unreasonable foreign interference and war provocation moves and 
accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  It also urged the South Korean authorities to discard the 
stance of dependence on outside forces and national 
confrontation and turn at an early date to the road of national 
independence, reconciliation and unity.

<F P=106> ["Far-Fetched Argument for Sinister Purpose" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The North side in recent 
telephone messages respectfully requested the South Korean Red 
Cross to immediately send back to the North Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan, prisoners of war and unconverted long-term prisoners, 
and take measures to allow the children of Kim Pyong-chu, an 
unconverted prisoner who died a few years ago, including the 
eldest daughter Kim Chi-hyon suffering from a serious disease, 
to come to the North to receive medical treatment and be 
protected in their livelihood. 
  The South side, however, has taken no positive measure for 
the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, arguing that they 
do not belong to the category of prisoners of war, and blindly 
turns down the request as regards Kim Chi-hyon. 
  It is self-evident that this is a far-fetched argument for a 
sinister purpose, directed by the South Korean authorities 
behind the scene, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The argument that Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan do not fall 
under 
the category of prisoners of war is a sheer distortion of fact. 
They are prisoners of war who were arrested by a warring party 
while active as guerrillas (militiamen) during the last war. 
The South side's argument is a violation of international law 
on humanitarianism and a far-fetched one. 
  What the South side argues about "acquirement of 
nationality" 
is also absurd. Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan have long since 
wished to return to the North and asked International Red Cross 
organisations to help them in their repatriation. It is 
unreasonable to try to keep them in South Korea for the reason 
of their "acquirement of (South Korean) nationality." 
  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan are not "killers of innocent 
people" as described by the South side but patriots who fought 
with arms in hand against foreign aggressors and the traitors of 
South Korea who plunged the innocent people into the scourge of 
war. 
  The South side is rejecting our hand of relief while failing 
to look after sick Kim Chi-hyon and give her medical treatment. 
  This is an act which can be done only by those devoid of 
humanism and national conscience. 
  Either in view of the requirement of international law or in 
view of the Red Cross idea of humanitarianism, it is only too 
natural that the prisoners of war should be repatriated and 
fellow countrymen suffering from poverty and illness be rescued. 
The South side must send them to the North as soon as possible. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst demands that the South Korean Red 
Cross meet the North's just demand with the original attitude of 
Red Cross.

  [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul, the 
nation-selling Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique held a so-called 
key commanders meeting of the puppet Air Force on 17 May to 
conspire a war plot for northward invasion. 
  At this meeting, the puppets took measures to strengthen the 
Air Force's combat-ready posture while talking about the need to 
make every preparation for regular war, mentioning threats by 
someone else. 
  Crying over the fictitious nuclear issue of the North, the 
U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are frenzied in war 
provocation maneuvers for a northward invasion by using the 
issue as a pretext. 
  The recent conspiracy plainly shows the true nature of the 
puppet clique that seeks to provoke a war, playing into U.S. 
hands [mijeui changdane chumul chumyonso chonjaeng tobarui killo

and citizens out of the participants in a commemoration ceremony 
and a people's rally on the 14th anniversary of the May 18 
Kwangju popular resistance which was held in Kwangju, the city 
of resistance, on May 18 went over to a demonstration from 11:00 
at night, according to a report from Seoul. 
  The demonstrators thronged to the Kwangju and South Cholla 
Provincial branches of the "Democratic Liberal Party" and 
strongly demanded a probe into the truth behind the Kwangju 
massacre which was still kept in the dark and the punishment of 
those responsible for it. 
  They continued the demonstration till past midnight, 
fighting 
the riot police. 
  That day another group of participants in the people's rally 
mourned those who fell in the Kwangju resistance, marching in a 
candle procession toward the Kwangju railway station along 
Kumnan road, the spot of the historical resistance.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies have been 
held in different parts of the DPRK to mark the 14th anniversary 
of the heroic Kwangju popular uprising in South Korea in May 
1980. 
  Mass rallies took place in South Pyongan and North Hwanghae 
Provinces Thursday. 
  The speakers at the rallies described the Kwangju uprising 
as 
an anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance in which the 
entire citizens of Kwangju rose up in a death-defying struggle 
for independence, democracy and reunification. 
  Fourteen years have passed since the resistance fighters of 
Kwangju shed blood of patriotism, but their desire has not been 
realised, the speakers said, adding that this is because the 
U.S. imperialists have not given up their design to keep hold on 
South Korea as their colony and military base. 
  Referring to the vicious campaign of the United States to 
stifle the DPRK over its "nuclear issue," the speakers said the 
United States unilaterally called off the third round of talks 
with the DPRK and is manipulating some dishonest quarters of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency in an effort to put 
"international pressure" on the DPRK. 
  If the desire of the Kwangju martyrs is to be realised, they 
said, it is essential to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons 
withdrawn from South Korea and overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime. The South Korean people and students must fight more 
courageously to bring about a new morning of democracy free from 
subjugation, they stressed.

National Committee of Struggle for the Reinstatement of the 
Detained, wanted and dismissed workers (Chonhaetu), an 
organization embracing workers of some 40 businesses, called for 
rising general turnout in the struggle for the reinstatement of 
dismissed workers at a rally held with the attendance of some 
1,000 workers, students and citizens, according to a South 
Korean newspaper report. 
  It criticized the Kim Yong-sam regime for turning a deaf ear 
to voices of the workers across the country calling for 
reinstatement and the guarantee of their right to live. "The 
reinstatement of the dismissed workers is possible only when a 
mass struggle is waged," it said, and stressed: "Let all of us 
devote our efforts, lives and energy to the struggle for their 
reinstatement." 
  It declared that the dismissed workers in all parts of South 
Korea would enter into a tent sit-in and a hunger strike for an 
indefinite period and wage a death-defying battle till their 
demands have been met.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Rice-transplanting is in 
full swing on the Yomju plain in North Pyongan Province which is 
situated in the northwestern part of Korea. 
  The farmers there who had assiduously made farming 
preparations from early spring are transplanting rice seedlings 
on 500 to 600 hectares of fields a day by raising the operation 
rate of farm machines including tractors, rice-transplanting 
machines and rice seedling-plucking machines and scrupulously 
organizing work when the season of rice-transplanting came. 
  The Yomju plain is one of the nation's major paddy rice 
producers. 
  Agricultural production in the plain called Pura plain 
before 
the liberation of the country was insignificant under the 
Japanese imperialists' colonial predatory policy. 
  After the liberation it has turned into a fertile land 
reaping bumper crops thanks to the correct agricultural policy 
of the DPRK Government. 
  The state has invested huge funds to increase agricultural 
production on the plain. It has built the Kuam, Sorim, Yonggok 
and Kwangbong reservoirs, more than 200 pumping stations, 
waterways extending several hundred kilometres and many 
irrigation setups. 
  The establishment of the Amnok River irrigation system with 
the Lake Manpung as the main source helped solve completely the 
water problem on the plain where a proper farming had been 
impossible for want of water, although it had a fertile arable 
land. 
  As a result of the completion of irrigation, not a small 
area 
of fields and tidal flats have been reclaimed and, now, the area 
under paddy rice is six times as large as that at the end of 
1944, the year before the liberation of the country. In the 
1980s, more than 8,800 hectares of tideland have been reclaimed. 
  There are over 20 cooperative farms on the plain. Each 
cooperative farm has scores of tractors and trucks, various 
trailing farm machines, rice-transplanting machines, rice 
seedling-plucking machines and other farm machines and means of 
transport. 
  Their level of the application of chemicals is high. The 
amount of application of chemical fertilizers per hectare was 
more than two tons on the plain last year. 
  Food grain production has annually increased. A gain of more 
than 12,000 tons was registered last year above the previous 
year. 
  In the same period, the income share of each farmer 
increased 
12 percent in grain and 28 percent in cash. 
  The production of meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables also has 
increased markedly. 
  The rural villages, with cosy modern dwelling houses, 
schools, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens and welfare and 
service facilities well arranged against the background of 
orchards, resemble a fairyland.

<F P=106> [Article by Choe In-tok, vice marshal of the Korean People's </F>
Army, KPA: "Loyalty to the Supreme Comrade Commander Is a Noble 
Ideological and Spiritual Ethos of the People's Army"] 
  [Text] Our People's Army is the army of the leader 
[suryong], the party, and the revolution. Its basic mission is 
to defend by force of arms the cause of the party and the cause 
of the leader [suryong], who pioneered the road of the 
revolution. This is our revolutionary armed forces' traditional 
and revolutionary character which has been purely and constantly 
handed down to us in the whole course of history from the days 
the first gun shot was heard at the forest of Mt. Paektu to date. 
  Loyalty to the leader [suryong] is the most basic 
ideological 
and spiritual characteristic that defines the true revolutionary 
character of our People's Army. Loyalty to the leader [suryong] 
fully displayed by our People's Army in the course of stern 
revolutionary wars, as well as in the flame of sharp class 
struggles, has attained an unprecedented, noble point today. 
  Our People's Army overflows with the firm and solid faith 
and 
wiof our party to have the People's Army, which will resolutely 
safeguard and defend the party and the leader [suryong] and will 
go through fire and water to endlessly execute an order if it is 
issued by the party. 
  The loyalty of our People's Army to thll to resolutely 
safeguard and uphold the supreme commander general Kim Chong-il 
by sharing forever its fate with him and by regarding loyalty to 
him as its life. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: It is 
the greatest glory and pride e supreme comrade commander is very 
clear and fresh and is hotter than fire. Therefore, it can be 
characterized as the most sacred and true loyalty that can never 
change under any circumstance. This has been inspired by the 
great leader [suryong] and is the noble ideological and 
spiritual ethos that can only be cherished by our People's Army 
which is being further strengthened and developed with each 
passing day by the warm solicitude of the outstanding leadership 
that has been inherited generation after generation. 
  Since the first day of its foundation, our People's Army has 
glorified the tradition of loyalty to absolutely and 
unconditionally uphold the ideology and leadership of the leader 
[suryong] by upholding its leader [suryong] as the center of the 
leadership and as its commander, by totally entrusting its fate 
to him, and by politically and ideologically safeguarding and 
defending him at the risk of its lives. 
  The proud tradition of the People's Army prepared by the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who founded our revolutionary 
armed force, has been more nobly and brilliantly inherited in 
the course of upholding the supreme commander General Kim 
Chong-il. The absolute and unconditional loyalty to the supreme 
commander General Kim Chong-il is a noble ideological and 
spiritual ethos of our People's Army. 
  Above all, the true loyalty of our People's Army to the 
supreme comrade commander has been vigorously displayed by a 
firm faith and will of the entire army, which resolutely 
safeguards the great general Kim Chong-il. 
  Today, the entire army wants to become the rifle and bomb 
that can safeguard our supreme comrade commander. This is a 
resolute determination of our People's Army ranks, as well as a 
slogan of faith and will highly raised by all of our officers 
and men of the People's Army. 
  The determination of loyalty vigorously forged in the hearts 
of the officers and men of the People's Army is based on a 
thorough revolutionary awareness and an absolute worship 
indicating that the supreme commander General Kim Chong-il is 
the destiny of our party and revolution, the fatherland and 
people, and the Army, the banner of victory, and is all [chonbu] 
of the bright future. 
  There is no fatherland, people, or army without the supreme 
comrade commander. This is the unshakable creed of soldiers and 
men of our People's Army. The noble and firm creed is a noble 
ideological sentiment that our People's Army soldiers have 
firmly cherished deep into their hearts during the days they 
receive the leadership from the dear comrade leader for a long 
time. This noble ideological sentiment firmly cherished by the 
officers and men of the People's Army has been further 
consolidated as they face stern difficulties and trials in the 
road of the revolution. 
  Taking advantage of the recent collapse of socialism and 
the resurrection of capitalism in some countries, offensives 
hurled by the imperialists and reactionaries against our 
Republic, the fortress of socialism, are reaching to extremes. 
As the result, our people's socialist cause has met with grave 
challenges. However, the stern trial of the history has been 
resolutely overcome, and our people and army are achieving 
victory after victory in the standoff with enemies without 
gunshots thanks to Comrade Kim Chong-il -- the great leader 
[yongdoja] of revolution with both literary and military 
accomplishments, the ever-victorious iron-willed commander, and 
the greatest general in the world [chonhajeil changun]. 
  In today's grandiose reality which has won worldwide 
admiration, our officers and men of the People's Army are 
cherishing deep in their hearts the truth that our people and 
army are courageous, that our socialist cause remains unmoved, 
and that our republic remains strong because the comrade supreme 
commander stands at the head of our party and revolution, and 
the state and the army. 
  Numerous officers and men of the People's Army have sent 
letters of loyalty carrying their resolute pledge to the comrade 
supreme commander and are striving to implement their pledge. 
Among them are eight brothers of officers who resolved to 
become eight stands of rifles and eight bombs defending the 
comrade supreme commander; eight brothers of officers who were 
determined to become six swords and shields guarding the comrade 
supreme commander; and the eight brothers and sisters of KPA 
officer Yi Chang-ung who promised to become true loyalists and 
dutiful sons and daughters safeguarding General Kim Chong-il at 
the very front with rifles by becoming eight Yi In-mo's. 
  There are many deeds of numerous heroes, whether they are 
famous or not, devoting their youth for the party and the leader 
-- such as in the case of Hero Han Yong-cho who covered an 
exploding hand-grenade with his body to save the portraits of 
the great leader and dear leader Comrades in an accidental 
touch-and-go moment -- are examples that prove their vows. 
  Such determinations, resolutions, and courageous conducts to 
resolutely defend the comrade supreme commander are lofty 
ideological, mental features that can only be cherished by our 
People's Army who were brought up by the hands of the great 
General Kim Chong-il. 
  The People's Army's true sense of loyalty toward the comrade 
supreme commander can also be clearly demonstrated on the road 
of unconditionally implementing great General Kim Chong-il's 
idea and leadership. 
  The idea and leadership of the Supreme Commander General Kim 
Chong-il are a decisive guarantee that triumphantly consummates 
the cause of chuche-oriented military construction. Thanks to 
the comrade supreme commander's idea and leadership, our 
People's Army has been strengthened and developed into today's 
one-a-match-for-hundred revolutionary armed forces firmly 
prepared in political, ideological, military, and technological 
aspects, and is fulfilling its noble mission as defenders of the 
party and revolution, and the fatherland and people. 
  Our officers and men of the People's Army, through their 
actual life experiences, have learned the comrade supreme 
commander's superior idea on military construction and his 
extraordinary leadership, and have kept in their hearts a firm 
creed that victory and glory can only be found on the road to 
upholding the idea and leadership of great General Kim Chong-il. 
  This has become the foundation of our soldiers of the 
People's Army who regard the comrade supreme commander's idea 
and intention as the invaluable demand of life and the greatest 
glory and happiness and who wish to demonstrate exploits by 
sacrificing themselves for the struggle to implement them. The 
comrade supreme commander's chuche-oriented military 
construction and his revolutionary lines have become the one and 
only guide in the military, political activities of our People's 
Army and all other sectors. Likewise, the revolutionary 
military ethos in which everyone works as one under the 
leadership of the comrade supreme commander are overflowing 
inside the entire ranks. 
  Holding firm the party's line on converting the entire army 
into a cadre, the entire officers and men of the People's Army 
are reliably improving their political and ideological, and 
military and technological preparations so as to fulfill their 
mission on a higher stage. In the struggle to realize the 
party's line on converting the entire army into a cadre, they 
have acquired knowledge in weapons, combat material and 
technical equipment as well as in the chuche-oriented strategic 
tactics and war method in accordance with the requirements of 
modern warfare weapons and our country's specific situation. 
Every military position of the entire country's defense lines 
has been built up impregnably. All these have been accomplished 
during the course of thoroughly implementing and absolutely 
upholding the comrade supreme commander's idea, leadership, 
orders, and instructions. 
  "When the comrade supreme commander decides, we will do!," 
the slogan of loyalty which is in high spirit among the entire 
army vividly shows up the strength and firmness of the spirit of 
absoluteness and unconditionality, and faith and will of our 
officers and men of the People's Army who are marching forward 
by upholding great General Kim Chong-il's idea and leadership. 
  In the rewarding struggle of faithfully upholding the 
comrade 
supreme commander's idea and leadership, the party's program on 
imbuing the entire army with the chuche idea has become a 
brilliant reality. 
  The party's system of leadership has been firmly established 
among the People's Army, a fundamental change has taken place in 
the ideological, mental features of officers and men, the 
lineage of chuche, the heritage of single-hearted unity and 
loyalty have been brilliantly inherited in every sector of 
military construction. 
  Guided by the idea of chuche-oriented military construction, 
the People's Army has been brought up as an invincible 
revolutionary armed forces equipped with modern offensive and 
defensive means, and reliable command capacity which can easily 
organize and carry out any operation or combat. What is more, 
soldiers have been firmly prepared as all-around men of 
combative spirit who can brilliantly fulfill its military 
mission under any circumstances, armed with the war method of 
our own style and the immortal chuche idea. 
  Under the leadership of the party, combat capacity has been 
incomparably strengthened not only among the People's Army, but 
also among the Working Red Guards and the Red Youth Vanguards, 
and all people have armed themselves, and the entire country has 
been consolidated as an impregnable fortress. 
  Loyalty of our People's Army -- who are upholding the 
comrade 
supreme commander's idea and leadership -- has not only been 
fully displayed in fulfilling its mission as defender of the 
fatherland but also in implementing its glorious mission as 
creators of the people's happiness. 
  In wholehearted response to the great General Kim Chong-il's 
grandiose plan on socialist construction, the officers and men 
of the People's Army are devoting their sweat of loyalty in the 
worthwhile combat ground of creation and construction. Heroic 
exploits performed by the soldiers of the People's Army are 
inscribed on every monumental creation that has glorified the 
era of the Workers Party of Korea -- including the 
world-renowned Sohae Lockgate, other various Lockgates at 
Taedong River and the construction of Pyongyang-Kaesong Highway. 
  Wisdom, courageousness, unequalled patriotic devotions, and 
mass heroism displayed by our officers and men of the People's 
Army -- who are determined to carry out the work of defending 
the fatherland and building socialism -- are all the more 
demonstrated proudly with each passing day along with the 
progress of our revolution. 
  On the road to upholding the comrade supreme commander's 
idea 
and leadership, our People's Army has brought the traditional 
blood ties with the people into a full bloom onto a more noble 
stage. Herein lies a firm guarantee enabling the army and the 
people to be united around the great general Kim Chong-il and to 
become a body of purity [sungyolche] united in one ideology and 
purpose and in moral obligation which can never be broken. 
  Truly, our People's Army's loyalty toward the Supreme 
Commander General Kim Chong-il sheds its ray as the most noble 
and lofty one as well as and the warmest, strongest, and 
invincible one which is unprecedented in the history of military 
construction. 
  Today, our revolutionary situation is very tense and the 
challenges of enemies are getting extreme with each passing day. 
However, as long as powerful one-a-match-for-a-hundred militant 
ranks of loyalty, the heroic People's Army, exists under the 
wise leadership of the comrade supreme commander, no stern 
crisis can ever check our march or dare touch us. 
  Our People's Army, as in the past, will be forever loyal to 
Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il. In doing so, it will 
brilliantly fulfill its glorious mission as the leader's army, 
the party's army, and the revolutionary army in consummating the 
chuche revolutionary cause; will achieve the fatherland 
reunification at the earliest possible date; and will glorify 
and determinedly defend the popular masses-centered socialism of 
our own style.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk from the "Ray of Chuche" program: "The </F>
Fundamental Principle in Socialism That Should Be Consistently 
Maintained in the Revolution and Construction"] 
  [Text] In his immortal classic work "The Historic Lessons 
in Socialist Construction and the General Line of our Party," 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il elucidated that the 
fundamental principle should be consistently maintained in order 
to defend and protect the socialist cause. 
  The idea and theory of dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on 
consistently maintaining the socialist principle in revolution 
and construction illuminated a revolutionary path that enables 
us to thoroughly smash the imperialists' anti-socialist 
maneuvers and to tenaciously defend, protect, and carry to 
accomplishment the socialist cause. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The 
principle of socialism should be consistently maintained in the 
revolution and construction to carry to accomplishment the 
socialist cause. 
  The dear comrade leader clearly expounded the fundamental 
principle that should be consistently maintained in socialist 
construction. The fundamental principle that should be 
consistently maintained in socialist construction is to 
thoroughly protect and embody the independent demands and 
interest of the popular masses. 
  The socialist society is a society that has embodied the 
natural demand of the popular masses to eliminate exploitation 
and oppression of the people by the people and to live all 
equally independently. The course of building socialism and 
communism is the course of realizing the total independence of 
the popular masses. 
  Although circumstances and conditions of struggle in the 
course of building socialism may change, the fundamental demand 
and position of the popular masses to achieve independence will 
never change. Therefore, the party of the working class should 
tenaciously defend the independent demand and interest of the 
popular masses while leading socialist construction, and should 
resolve all problems raised in the revolution and construction 
thoroughly in accordance with the fundamental interest of the 
popular masses. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has clearly elucidated 
the issue as to how one should carry out work to maintain the 
fundamental principle of socialism. 
  For one to maintain the fundamental principle of socialism, 
which defends and protects the independent demand and 
fundamental interest of the popular masses, one should 
strengthen the party of the working class organizationally and 
ideologically, and should firmly ensure the party's guidance 
over the revolution and construction. In addition, one should 
constantly enhance the role and functions of the socialist 
regime; should adhere to and develop the socialist ownership, 
and should tenaciously struggle against the imperialists. 
  This is the revolutionary principle which we cannot concede 
even to a slightest degree. The independent demand and interest 
of the popular masses can be firmly ensured and achieved only by 
the leadership of the party of the working class. 
  The working class is the class that has embodied 
independence 
at the highest level and that struggles more tenaciously than 
any other class for achieving the independent demands and 
interest of the popular masses. 
  For the working class and for its party, there cannot be any 
other demands and interest than the demands and interest of the 
popular masses. The class mission of the working class is to 
thoroughly defend and achieve the demands and interest of the 
popular masses. 
  Therefore, it is an indispensable demand to maintain 
consistently and thoroughly the embodiment of the revolutionary 
principle in socialist construction to strengthen the party and 
firmly ensure the party's leadership. 
  It is a firm guarantee for thoroughly adhering to the 
principle of socialism to strengthen the socialist regime and 
enhance its role and functions. 
  The socialist regime is a commanding system that represents 
the sovereignty of the popular masses--the masters of socialist 
society--and manages overall domains of socialist life in a 
unified manner. 
  Thanks to the socialist regime, the independence of the 
popular masses is to be ensured, creative activities are to be 
carried out in a unified manner, and socialist construction is 
to be pushed for. 
  Only when we strengthen the socialist regime, can we always 
dampen the swell of antirevolutionary factors by using 
revolutionary weapons under the condition that the imperialists 
are continuously maneuvering against socialism. 
  To maintain [kosu] and develop socialist ownership is also 
important in holding fast to socialist principles. If we fail 
to maintain socialist ownership and tend toward private 
ownership, we would completely destroy the socialist system 
itself and, as a result, the working people would become slaves 
of capital. 
  Therefore, we should constantly develop socialist ownership 
by evolving cooperative ownership into all-people ownership 
[hyoptongjok soyurul choninminjok soyuero chopkunsikinun 
pangboburo] while continuously enhancing the guiding role of 
all-people ownership. 
  Revolutionary principles in socialist construction are 
importantly shown in one's attitude toward imperialists. It is 
particularly important to thoroughly hold fast to an anti- 
imperialist position under the situation in which imperialists 
are strengthening the antirevolutionary maneuver to annihilate 
[wahae] and destroy [malsal] the socialist cause. Accordingly, 
we should continue to struggle against imperialism. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il not only elucidated 
questions raised in adhering to socialist principles, but also 
clearly explained that one should not abandon the basic 
principle of socialism under any condition and that even the 
slightest concession of the basic socialist principle would 
result in the grave situation that the party itself will be 
destroyed and socialism will be frustrated. 
  We should creatively develop our line and policies in 
accordance with the changing environments and conditions for the 
revolutionary struggle in the course of building socialism, 
communism. Under any situation, however, the working-class 
party shouldering the people's destinies should not deviate from 
revolutionary principles and the working-class line. 
  To abandon revolutionary principles in the struggle in 
between socialism and capitalism means surrender and 
degeneration. If one vacillates in a temporary obstacle, yields 
under the imperialists' pressure, and abandons revolutionary 
principles after making a gradual concession of them, it will 
result in an unimaginably grave consequence. 
  In adhering to the basic principle of socialism, it is 
particularly important to heighten our caution against pluralism 
being blared by imperialists and to thoroughly oppose it. The 
so-called pluralism cannot be allowed in socialist society. 
Ideological freedom, a multi-party political system, and varied 
ownership under the mask of pluralism are political methods of a 
capitalist society that is governed by a struggle for existence 
based on individualism and liberalism. 
  As the socialist society is based on collectivism, and its 
heart [saengmyong] is the unity of popular masses, socialism and 
pluralism cannot coexist. Introduction of pluralism in 
socialism would encourage individualism and liberalism, which 
will infringe upon common social interests, destroy the unity of 
popular masses, and create social disorder and confusion. The 
allowance of ideological freedom and a multi-party political 
system will result in the destruction of socialist ground. 
  An ideological struggle is the prelude of a political 
struggle, which finally develops into a power struggle. If 
antisocialist ideological trends are dissipated due to 
ideological liberalization and antirevolutionary political 
parties' activities are guaranteed by the allowance of democracy 
represented by the so-called multi-party system, the class 
enemies and reactionaries will raise their heads and try to 
conquer the people's regime. 
  If we generally accept the capitalist political methods and 
economic system after completely abandoning socialist 
principles, being obsessed by an illusion of capitalism without 
faith in socialism, socialism will be frustrated and capitalism 
will revive. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il taught 
[karuchisimyonso] 
us that only one step backward from socialist principles will 
lead one to make 100 steps of concession and retrogression, and 
stressed that we should keep them to the last under any 
condition. 
  Embodied herein is our party's revolutionary position and 
iron-strong will to consummate the socialist, communist cause 
under the banner of the chuche idea while boldly overcoming any 
severe circumstance and trial. 
  The justness of the ideological theory on invariably 
adhering 
to socialist principles in the revolution and construction is 
clearly proven by specific realities in our country. All party 
members and working people should firmly keep the basic 
principle of socialism, whose justness and vitality are 
obviously being demonstrated, and should faithfully uphold the 
leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] The court has handed down sentences in three of the 
fives cases of copyright violation under the 1978 Copyright Law. 
The cases are being watched by the United States as criteria to 
judge whether or not Thailand should be removed from the U.S. 
Priority Watch List. 
  Reporting on the matter, Deputy Commerce Minister Chulin 
Laksanawisit said the five cases of copyright violation are of 
great interests to foreigners. He said the court so far had 
ruled on three cases. The Macalpine Company is subjected to a 
fine of 80,000 baht and one-year probation pending a jail term 
of eight months. The three defendants in the Robot case were 
subjected to a fine of 35,000 baht each, but the sum was reduced 
to half because they all confessed. The Sky Company was 
subjected to a fine of 200,000 baht and one-year probation 
pending a prison term of one year. Two other cases, the Super 
Peacock and the MBK cases, are still under the hearing of 
plaintiff witnesses. 
  The five cases, in addition to the copyright bill which is 
to 
be approved by the parliament, are being used by the United 
States as conditions to decide whether to remove Thailand from 
the Priority Watch List.

  [Text] Ambassador to the Union of Myanmar [Burma] Wirasak 
Futrakun reported on investment in Burma. He said the situation 
is at a turning point after the Burmese government allowed 
100-percent investment by the private sector instead of 
assigning state enterprises to supervise operations as in the 
past. Besides, he said the Burmese Government has a policy of 
promoting foreign investment, and has announced that foreigners 
can lease from 12,500 to 75,000 rai of land for business 
operations for up to 30 years unconditionally. 
  Reporting on foreign investment, Wirasak said Singapore tops 
the list with investment capital worth U.S. $240 million. The 
United States ranks second with U.S. $210 million. South Korea 
ranks third at U.S. $90 million; Thailand fourth at U.S. $70 
million; the United Kingdom fifth at U.S. $60 million; and Japan 
sixth at U.S. $50 million. Thailand leads other countries, 
however, in fishing and logging sectors. Anyway, the Burmese 
Government has finally enacted a law banning logging by private 
companies and prohibiting log exports from the country. Burma 
has also banned exports of marine life. It has encouraged 
foreigners to set up sawmills, furniture, and plywood factories. 
  The ambassador said the Burmese Government has opened 
bidding 
for five plywood factories. More than 30 foreign companies, 
including those from Thailand, tendered for concessions. 
Singapore and Korean companies won the bidding for plywood 
factories. Thai companies have won bids to open furniture 
factories. Wirasak said Thai businessmen should form groups to 
better compete with other countries, especially in the hotel and 
tourism sectors where Singapore is keen and has substantial 
capital for investment. He said two Thai companies had won 
concessions for tin and coal mining. The Phadaeng Group, Loxley, 
and Siam Cement Group are considering investment or joint 
investment in other businesses.

  [Text] Army Spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan yesterday 
denied a fresh allegation that Thailand is providing a sanctuary 
for secretive Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. 
  "There is no reason for Thailand to provide a refuge for Pol 
Pot," he emphatically told THE NATION. 
  Phalangkun was responding to a FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW 
news release yesterday which reported that Pol Pot is believed 
to be residing in a well-guarded compound inside a durian 
plantation in Chanthaburi province. 
  Khmer Rouge defectors told the REVIEW that the renegade 
faction leader had found a safe haven in Thailand after spending 
some time in a special residence in the Phnum Chhat area near 
the Thai border in late 1993. 
  Branding the allegation "outdated information," Phalangkun 
insisted that the Army wanted to confirm that Pol Pot was not 
living in Thai territory. 
  The communists Khmer Rouge rejected participation in 
UN-organized elections in Cambodia in May 1993. The guerrillas 
continue to fight for an advisory role in the government. 
  An earlier report said that Khmer Rouge nominal chief Khieu 
Samphan agreed last week to meet Cambodian government 
representatives for peace talks in North Korea scheduled to 
begin on May 27.

  [Text] Police are preparing to issue arrest warrants for 
two foreigners suspected of involvement in a planned terrorist 
attack that was discovered by sheer luck in Bangkok in March, a 
top police commander said yesterday. 
  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit 
Kanchanakit did not identify their nationalities. 
  A one-ton bomb made from ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer 
and C-4 explosive was found in mid-March in a six-wheel truck 
that had been seized by police and parked in front of the 
Lumphini police station since it was involved in a minor traffic 
accident near the Israeli Embassy on March 11. 
  Chaisit said that he had no idea if the two foreigners were 
still in Thailand. Police have said they suspected foreign 
terrorists, in collaboration with local people, were behind the 
unsuccessful terrorist attack. No identities of the suspected 
terrorists had been revealed although police said they had 
collected intelligence information about them. 
  A Muslim man was held by police in Narathiwat's Muang 
district on Wednesday on suspicion that he was a member of a 
southern separatist group preparing to carry out an act of 
sabotage in the South. 
  Ma-ae Buraheng, 27, from Narathiwat's Bacho district, was 
held after police stopped a taxi at a checkpoint in Ban Khao 
Tanyong area, Narathiwat police chief Panya Thiansat said. 
Police found a membership card of the Pattani United Liberation 
Organization (Pulo) in his underpants, Pol Col Panya said. In a 
search of his camouflage backpack, police found military 
fatigues, a pair of jungle boots, an alarm clock, a bag of rice, 
a needle and number of electric wires, he said. He said police 
had not yet filed charges against Ma-ae. The suspect may be 
charged with either organized crime or being a rebel, as 
suggested by his Pulo member card, he added. The suspect was 
being held at Tanyong police station pending further 
questioning, which would be jointly conducted by police and 
military officers, he said. 
  In another development, Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wutthimethi 
dismissed press reports that he had approved a request to arrest 
13 additional suspects for involvement in a series of violent 
incidents in the South. 
  "Up till now, I have never seen such a request from the 
police, Yuwat told reporters.

  [Text] Yala -- Separatist was killed and two government 
soldiers seriously wounded in three running battles between a 
government patrol and bandits of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional 
(BRN) yesterday, 
  Police said the combined 30-strong patrol of police and 
rangers from Raman and Kabang districts clashed for the first 
time with the bandit group under Poh Layu on a mountain near Ban 
Khlong Khing in Kabang District, about two kilometers from the 
border with Malaysia. 
  The clash, which took place about 1.45 p.m. in a heavy rain, 
lasted for about 40 minutes. A soldier, Pvt Somsak Phunsom, was 
shot in the left arm. He was evacuated by helicopter to Yala 
Hospital an hour later. 
  The second clash took place about two hours later. During 
the clash, a defense volunteer, Phanom Sangphet, lost both legs 
after stepping on a land mine. 
  The third firefight took place late in the afternoon for 
about 10 minutes in the same locality. After the clash, the 
body of a bandit was found at the scene with an AK47 rifle.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Japanese Self-Defense 
Forces (SDF) is boosting support of a night-landing practice 
(NLP) by U.S. military aircraft at Iwo Island, popularly known 
as Iwojima, about 1,300 kilometers south of Tokyo. 
  It was the first time the SDF backed the solo exercise by 
planes from the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence. Previously 
the SDF had cooperated with the U.S. Forces as part of a joint 
military drill. 
  The U.S. Forces previously conducted NLP at Atsugi Naval Air 
Station in Kanagawa Prefecture. But Japan and the United States 
agreed to move the landings to Iwojima starting last year due to 
complaints of noise from residents around Atsugi. 
  This year's practice is one of the largest, with 25 deck 
planes and some 400 pilots participating. 
  In cooperation, the Air Self-Defense Force has dispatched 10 
transport planes to carry U.S. ground crew officials and 
materials, while the Maritime Self-Defense Force offered 20 
officials to back up air control and ground support and a rescue 
plane in case of an accident. 
  Japan has also spent some 17 billion yen to construct 
lodging 
and hangars for the U.S. forces in Iwojima. The U.S. is 
expected to spend about 33 million yen for NLP this year, 
according to official sources. 
  Speculation is that the SDF support is to pave the way for 
concluding the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) 
with the U.S., in which the two forces provide each other with 
materials. 
  Conclusion of the ACSA suddenly became an issue due to 
concerns that North Korea may be building nuclear weapons. 
  The Defense Agency said the SDF Law and Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty permit Japan's support of U.S. night-landing practices 
at Iwojima.

  [Text] Vienna, May 20 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Friday [20 May] North Korea has 
already begun removing spent fuel rods from a 5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of 
Pyongyang. 
  The U.N. Nuclear Monitoring Agency said it has sent a letter 
to North Korea warning that the continued removal of the rods 
would be a violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  On Thursday, U.S. Government and diplomatic sources in 
Washington reported the three-member IAEA inspection team had 
determined that a small number of the estimated 8,000 fuel rods 
had already been removed from the reactor. 
  The IAEA and the United States fear that plutonium extracted 
from the rods may be diverted to a suspected nuclear arms 
development program. 
  The IAEA has said the future removal of the fuel rods 
without 
the agency's supervision and without marking and separating them 
would be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  This would force the watchdog agency to refer the problem to 
the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. State Department sources said the IAEA 
team's 
checks of the monitoring cameras and seals at the radiochemical 
laboratory at the complex in Yongbyon are progressing smoothly 
and should be completed soon. 
  Another IAEA inspection team in March was denied access to 
the laboratory by the North Koreans, raising suspicions that 
Pyongyang is trying to build a nuclear bomb.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Yasushi Akashi, United 
Nations special representative to the former Yugoslavia, 
dismissed suggestions Friday [20 May] that there are differences 
of opinions within the U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor), Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  Akashi told Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa in a 10-minute 
telephone conversation he thinks it natural that there are 
criticisms against him, but that he wants to continue making his 
utmost efforts without being too sensitive about them, the 
officials said. 
  He also said he wants to value the neutrality of the U.N. in 
pursuing his job. 
  Akashi, who is currently in Zagreb, denied there are 
differences of opinions within the Unprofor and described it as 
a monolith, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa told Akashi that Japan highly values his work 
despite criticism from European countries and the United States, 
and his neutral stance despite conflicting interests among 
warring parties in Bosnia, they said. 
  He also said Japan plans to send a delegation to a U.N.- 
sponsored international meeting on reconstruction of Sarajevo, 
to be held next Tuesday and Wednesday in Vienna. Japan will 
look into possible cooperation. 
  The foreign minister was quoted as saying it is difficult 
for 
Japan to send personnel to Unprofor at present, but that the 
government wants to consider it on a mid- to long-term 
perspective. 
  Akashi said he still wants Japan to join the Unprofor-led 
peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia and called on 
the nation to consider it from a long-term perspective. 
  Akashi also called for Japanese support for Macedonia, 
saying 
that maintaining neutrality and independence of Macedonia and 
Albania are important, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The governing coalition 
Friday [20 May] sketched out an official view concerning the 
definition of a controversial phrase on Japan's defense policy 
that has been under parliamentary fire from the opposition. 
  The wording "universal security" was inserted into a common 
policy platform document under an April 22 agreement by 
coalition parties as a prerequisite for launching the coalition 
government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  The document of policy coordination commitments said the 
coalition "recognizes the fact that the Japanese Constitution 
adopts as its ideal universal security (to be guaranteed) by the 
United Nations, while it allows Japan to actively join U.N. 
activities for peace and maintain the Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty." 
  The day's announcement defined the wording as "the whole 
framework of measures for maintaining peace and security to be 
taken by the United Nations." 
  It said the coalition decided to use the adjective 
"universal," as the perception of such measures for maintaining 
the security of a country "is taken as a matter of course by the 
whole international community." 
  The announcement also defined another disputed phrase, 
"collective security," the clarification of which has been 
demanded by opposition interpellators in House of 
Representatives sessions since May 11. 
  It defined collective security as "appropriate measures 
taken 
in solidarity by the international community, in order to 
restore peace, against a country or group which invades another 
or destroys or threatens peace." 
  It called attention to the U.N. Charter as the reference 
document that "stipulates concrete measures" for restoring peace. 
  Hata earlier told a Diet session that the perception of 
universal security is identical to that of collective security. 
  However, the announcement said Japan is under the 
constraints 
of its Constitution "when Japan participates in or cooperates 
with U.N. activities designed to restore peace and security." 
  Article 9 of the Constitution bars Japan from using military 
forces to resolve international disputes.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan declared Friday [20 
May] it will join an international economic embargo against 
Haiti to help oust its military government from power and 
restore civilian rule. 
  Japan will stop loans and investment to Haiti's military 
authorities in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 917, 
adopted on May 6, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  The Japanese Government has already banned flights between 
Japan and Haiti except for regular passenger flights, and has 
also taken measures to prevent Haiti military leaders from 
entering Japan, under the U.N. sanctions, it said. 
  Tokyo will also abide by a trade embargo against the 
Caribbean state which takes effect at Saturday midnight, it said. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a 
statement that Japan strongly hopes leaders of the Haiti 
military will take immediate steps to restore democracy. 
  The Security Council unanimously voted on May 6 to tighten 
sanctions against Haiti's military rulers to force them to allow 
the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and 
restore democracy. 
  The resolution calls for banning entry of Haiti military 
leaders into all U.N. member countries, and embargoes exports to 
Haiti except for medical goods and food. 
  It also recommends U.N. member countries to ensure that the 
Haiti military and its leaders cannot use their funds and 
financial resources. 
  The Haiti Army ousted Aristide, Haiti's first democratically 
elected president, in a coup in September 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's trade surplus posted 
a fifth consecutive year-on-year monthly increase in April as 
the politically sensitive surplus with the United States rose 
for the second month in a row, the Finance Ministry said Friday 
[20 May]. 
  The increase came as informal U.S.-Japan trade talks resumed 
in Washington, and a ministry official stressed "the unchanged 
recent trend of declining exports and rising imports and 
declining overall yen-based surplus." 
  The overall customs-cleared merchandise trade surplus rose 
an 
unadjusted 8.1 percent to 11.12 billion dollars as the surplus 
with the U.S. rose 8.9 percent to 4.38 billion dollars, the 
ministry said. 
  In yen terms, however, the overall figure fell 1.6 percent 
to 
mark the third straight decline with the surplus with the U.S. 
dipping 0.9 percent after rising the previous month. 
  The official, briefing reporters, said the yen's rise is 
contributing to boosting imports and curbing export volume but 
has yet to be sufficiently passed along to prices due to the 
so-called J-curve effects of swelling dollar-term figures. 
  The dollar averaged 104.43 yen in April, down 10.0 percent 
from a year before. 
  April exports rose 7.1 percent from a year before to 32.89 
billion dollars, and imports climbed 6.6 percent to 21.77 
billion dollars -- both gaining for 14 months in a row. 
  In yen terms, exports fell 2.7 percent for the 13th straight 
monthly decline, and imports dropped 3.2 percent for the 24th. 
  Referring to the index of trade growth, the official said 
export volume decreased for three consecutive months, and 
imports for 12 months. 
  Looking ahead, he expressed hopes for a dollar-based 
shrinkage from summer as the dollar had fallen to the 105-yen 
level in the period from June through August. 
  Many private economists agreed that the dollar-term surplus 
would move lower. 
  Nobuyuki Saji, senior economist at the Nikko Research 
Center, 
said, "the trend for lower surpluses in terms of volume and the 
yen is certainly fixed." 
  Some kind of an effect from the yen's rise last summer can 
be 
expected ahead, he said. 
  "But a sharp shrinkage is unlikely," Saji said, noting 
strong 
exports to recovering overseas markets, particularly of 
electronics products to the U.S. 
  In April, major export gainers were semiconductor and other 
electronics parts, up 31.8 percent, automobile parts, up 28.3 
percent, and ships, up 62.4 percent. 
  For imports, semiconductor and other electronics parts rose 
33.1 percent, clothing gained 19.3 percent and aircraft surged 
140.0 percent. 
  The ministry official said that many special factors were 
seen in April to judge the overall trend, citing increased 
exports of huge tankers, higher imports of aircraft, and lower 
crude oil prices. 
  With crude prices falling 21.2 percent to 14.57 dollars per 
barrel, imports fell 20.4 percent in value while volume remained 
almost unchanged. 
  Among other countries, Japan's trade surplus with the 
European Union fell 11.6 percent to 2.32 billion dollars for the 
fourth straight decline, and the gap with other Asian nations 
rose 12.4 percent to 5.31 billion dollars for the 24th 
consecutive increase.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19, KYODO -- The House of Councillors 
Budget Committee failed Thursday [19 May] to discuss a stopgap 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1994 over an opposition demand 
to summon a former attorney to a Buddhist lay group linked to 
Komeito, a core party in the ruling coalition. 
  The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) demanded 
that Masatomo Yamazaki, former attorney to Soka Gakkai, be 
summoned as an unsworn witness in connection with his alleged 
attempt to tap a telephone line at the House of Japanese 
Communist Party Chairman Kenji Miyamoto. 
  Soka Gakkai is the primary support base for Komeito and 
their 
ties have often become the focus of disputes over the separation 
of religion and politics stipulated in the Constitution. 
  The coalition urged the LDP to attend the committee session 
on Friday to deliberate the 10.89 trillion yen stopgap 
supplementary budget, which will extend for 40 days an original 
50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen that expires 
Friday. 
  The LDP, however, declined because the coalition rejected 
its 
demand, parliamentary sources said. 
  The more powerful House of Representatives approved the 
stopgap supplementary budget on Wednesday. 
  The rare supplement to a provisional budget, the first since 
fiscal 1990, followed the continued political turmoil involving 
the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the 
selection as premier of Tsutomu Hata. 
  Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget 
for 
the 1994 fiscal year finally started Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- An unusual supplement to an 
earlier stopgap budget nearing expiration cleared the last 
parliamentary hurdle to become a law Friday upon approval from 
the House of Councillors. 
  The plenary session of the upper house of the Japanese 
parliament passed the 10.89 trillion yen supplement to extend 
for 40 days an earlier 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 
trillion yen. 
  The revised stopgap budget, totaling 21.94 trillion yen, 
will 
expire June 29, when the current Diet session ends. 
  The rare revision of a stopgap budget -- the first since 
fiscal 1990 -- was necessitated by the political confusion 
following the abrupt resignation of former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and the selection of Tsutomu Hata as his 
successor. 
  The political turmoil had long stalled Diet deliberations on 
the 73.08 trillion yen full budget for fiscal 1994, which 
started April 1, until Tuesday when budgetary debates finally 
began. 
  The chances for quick passage of the full budget, however, 
are viewed as slim because the Hata government holds only a 
minority in the Diet. 
  The revised interim budget earmarks as little as possible 
for 
the running of administrative bodies, while boosting outlays for 
public works projects. 
  Revised outlays for administrative expenses are set at 25 
percent of the full budget, up from 14 percent in the initial 
stopgap budget. 
  Public works got an additional 1.07 trillion yen, bringing 
the total so far to 3.84 trillion yen, about three-sevenths of 
such investments envisaged under the full budget.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii by NHK </F>
announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata; place and date not given; from the 
"NHK News 7" program] 
  [Text] [Kawabata] The Hata administration is a minority 
government. Do you think that this will have some negative 
impact on approval of the fiscal 1994 budget? Also, do you 
think you can count on cooperation from the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ], which seceded from the coalition 
government? 
  [Fujii] At the least, we worked together to form the budget. 
We had ministerial level discussions with former cabinet members 
of the SDPJ. I believe that they share the same views with us. 
Therefore, I will talk to them and do my best to ask for their 
cooperation. 
  [Kawabata] Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei 
Kono said that passage of the budget modification should be 
carried out when necessary. What do you think about his 
statement? 
  [Fujii] The LDP is the largest opposition party, so, we 
should listen carefully to his comments. At the same time, we 
will explain the rationale behind the budget in more detail to 
increase their understanding. 
  [Kawbata] The provisional budget will expire next week. 
What do you think about the supplementary budget? 
  [Fujii] As of today, we want to have budget discussions in 
the Diet as soon as possible. However, in practice, I know we 
need to think about a supplementary budget because funds are 
needed immediately. In fact, the mechanism for a supplementary 
budget ends with the provisional budget. However, I am not in a 
position to announce the decision. We will see how the 
discussions will proceed before we make the final decision. 
  [Kawabata] Another major task for the administration is tax 
reform. Now that the SDPJ has gone, I wonder how the finance 
minister will cope with the issue. Have you changed your 
policies since the split with the SDPJ? 
  [Fujii] The basic policy remains unchanged from the previous 
cabinet. I think that the Tax System Research Council's 
recommendations are also unchanged. We need to think how we can 
financially support our future welfare society. Now we have a 
progressive tax system, which has already reached its limit when 
compared to other countries. At the moment, taxation is 
concentrated on income tax and salaried workers, in particular, 
shoulder the burden. Now, we need to have broader taxation of 
lower percentages. For instance, more consumption tax to 
increase revenues to support welfare. I believe this will 
benefit both tax payers and those who receive social services. 
  [Kawabata] Howe do you foster good public understanding on 
such matters? 
  [Fujii] Of course, such matters require the consensus of the 
people and agreement in parliament. This is the most important 
point. Therefore, we need to publicize and promote the concept 
at the same time. When I was deputy finance minister 13 years 
ago, we launched a nationwide treasury campaign. We need to 
talk to financial business people as well as to explain the 
concept to the public. 
  [Kawabata] What about the review of the consumption tax? 
  [Fujii] This issue has been taken up in the Tax System 
Research Council for discussions. Many people are discussing 
the possibility of reviewing the system. A simplified tax 
system, duty free shops, tax exemption limits, and other matters 
need to be reviewed. The final decision should be made based on 
that review. Anyway, discussions ought to take place. 
  [Kawabata] Do you think it will be possible for the tax 
reform bills to be passed during the current Diet session? 
  [Fujii] The government's tax reform platform says that the 
reform should be implemented by the end of this year. The 
governing coalition agreed to make the final decision in June. 
That schedule has not been changed. The cabinet decided to 
carry out tax reform this year. I cannot say about ongoing 
discussions among the political parties. But, I understand that 
they have a schedule in their minds as well. 
  [Kawabata] You think it is essential for the tax reform 
bills to pass parliament in June. But, is this possible? 
  [Fujii] The coalition continues its discussions to meet that 
timeframe. The Finance Ministry is also doing all it can to 
conform to the schedule.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's Cabinet endorsed Friday [20 May] a decision to freeze 
hikes in public service charges until the end of the year, 
officials said. 
  The decision comes after a barrage of public criticism over 
recent rate hike plans in the midst of a sluggish economy. 
  Officials said the cabinet decision is intended to stem the 
rate increases in domestic telephone charges, rent for public 
housing, taxi fares, expressway tolls and fire insurance 
premiums. 
  The cabinet will ask local autonomous bodies not to raise 
fees charged for their bus and subway services, they said. 
  On Tuesday, Hata instructed chief cabinet Secretary Hiroshi 
Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio 
Terasawa to move quickly in putting a freeze on public utility 
rates. Many political analysts said the freeze is Hata's 
apparent bid to rally public support for his minority government 
in the face of attacks from the opposition on his weak political 
standing.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's Cabinet on Friday [20 May] gave the official go-ahead to 
the premier's proposed freeze of public service charges until 
the end of the year. 
  The cabinet endorsed Hata's call for halting all planned 
hikes on domestic phone charges, public housing rents, taxi 
fares, expressway tolls and fire insurance premiums. 
  The government also requested local governments to follow 
suit, asking them not to raise charges on their services such as 
public- sector buses and subways, and water supply. 
  It is the first freeze of public charges since 1974, and the 
first such sweeping one since 1964. 
  Hata's "political decision" came on Wednesday in response to 
a torrent of criticism from the public and business circles that 
governmental organizations are too willing to raise charges 
while the private sector is forced to make cuts to cope with the 
worst recession in the postwar period. 
  The step, generally welcomed by businesses and consumers, 
was 
described by political analysts as an attempt to win public 
support for his precariously positioned minority government. 
  Hata's announcement also came as "a bolt out of the blue" 
for 
most bureaucrats who supervise public-sector organizations' 
charges. 
  Some top government officials made clear they are irked by 
the decision, which was taken without consulting them. 
  One such official said, "ministries are all opposed to the 
measure. That's why it was a political decision. But they will 
follow their bosses' decision." 
  Cabinet members lauded the move and insisted that the margin 
of increases will not be raised when the freeze ends. 
  "The significance of the step lies in its being a sweeping 
one. It is our political decision," said Economic Planning 
Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa. 
  "We need to boost consumer confidence to lift the economy," 
he told a press conference. 
  Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami said at a separate press 
conference that his ministry will not allow larger hikes in 
expressway tolls or taxi fares because of the freeze than those 
already applied for. 
  Futami also said he will take account of the economic 
conditions in considering the timing of lifting the cap on 
charges, suggesting a possibility of extending the freeze beyond 
the end of the year. 
  Construction Minister Koji Morimoto, however, said he 
regards 
the measure as applying only for this year. 
  "I am not thinking about (a freeze) of one or two years 
beyond the year-end," he said. 
  Some cabinet members called for a review of the way 
expressway tolls are determined. 
  During unofficial talks after the cabinet meeting, Futami 
said the basic problems concerning the method of calculating 
highway tolls should be reconsidered by the year-end. 
  He reportedly argued that the principal problem is that the 
depreciation costs for the land are reflected in the tolls. 
  Morimoto admitted at the press conference the need for 
reviewing the calculation method, while emphasizing the 
importance of maintaining the construction plans for expressways. 
  Highways are built by public corporations with borrowed 
money 
which they pay back with the revenue from tolls.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- A political decision to 
freeze planned hikes in public service charges must be followed, 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [20 May], brushing 
off opposition by bureaucrats. 
  Fujii said he highly evaluated the "political decision by 
Prime Minister (Tsutomu) Hata," and the ministry will review 
requested hikes in nonlife insurance premiums in line with the 
freeze, Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet 
meeting. His comments came after Finance Ministry bureaucrats 
led by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito criticized the premier's 
decision. 
  Saito told reporters Thursday that he was dissatisfied with 
the decision to freeze all applied-for hikes in public service 
charges, including highway tolls, taxi fares and telephone 
rates. Saito's remarks made headlines in many newspapers, with 
one daily calling it a "coup" bid by bureaucrats. 
  Fujii said he has not heard of such comments. "I understand 
that the vice minister just said that we must follow cabinet 
decisions." 
  The plan announced Wednesday to freeze hikes this year was 
endorsed at the morning cabinet meeting. Hikes applied for in 
government-controlled charges include telephone fees, public 
housing rents, highway tolls, and fire and marine insurance 
premiums. 
  As for requested increases in nonlife insurance premiums 
which the finance minister controls, Saito said the minister 
would review applications to see whether the freeze is possible. 
But if found difficult, he suggested the ministry would seek 
exemption. 
  Fujii said, "we must go over to promote streamlining" of 
nonlife insurance firms. 
  Saito said the requests for premium hikes were made to 
"maintain a sound insurance system." Casualty insurance firms 
were in a pinch because of increased payouts on disaster and 
other cases, he said. 
  In their separate statements, Fujii and Saito shared the 
view 
that the freeze is not related to the coming tax reform, in 
contrast with the prime minister's comments on such a link. 
  After making his decision on the rate hike freeze, Hata said 
it would pave the way for winning public support on tax 
increases to offset income tax cuts. 
  Concerning the possibility of even greater hikes in public 
service charges after the freeze ends, both Fujii and Saito said 
that streamlining is necessary to avoid placing such a burden on 
consumers. But Fujii welcomed the decision taken at a time when 
the economy "is in a crucial stage" with both good and bad signs. 
  "We must now steadily implement the February stimulus 
package 
and the fiscal 1994 budget" to spread the recent improvements, 
Fujii said, noting that long-delayed Diet deliberations on the 
budget are set to begin. 
  "If the economy starts picking up and enters a stable growth 
phase, later fee hikes will be absorbed eventually," he added.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 20 KYODO -- Transport Minister Nobuaki 
Futami denied Friday [20 May] that transportation charges will 
be raised sharply next January after the freeze on hikes in 
public charges this year comes to an end. 
  "The ministry won't be adding anything extra onto the rises 
that were withheld this year," Futami said, dismissing 
speculation that expressway tolls and taxi fares could jump when 
the freeze ends. 
  He said the hikes could be delayed from the planned Jan. 1 
for political reasons, and that there could be another freeze if 
the economy still looks bad at that time. 
  "A lifting of the freeze depends on an economic recovery. If 
the situation looks serious, we will be giving the matter 
further consideration," he said. 
  The minister expressed caution toward exempting the fares of 
small regional taxi companies from the hike freeze this year. 
  "People could be put off from using taxis, (if such 
companies 
are allowed to raise their fares)," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Friday [20 May] called for an 
overall review of the methods for setting public service 
charges, particularly highway tolls. 
  The proposal was made in connection with the government's 
latest decision to uniformly freeze proposed hikes in public 
service rates until the end of the year in easing the burdens on 
a recession-hit private sector. 
  Speaking to reporters, Hata said many cabinet ministers 
agreed earlier in the day on the need for a "thorough and 
drastic review" of the current rate-fixing system. 
  Hata especially criticized "a pool system" used to calculate 
highway tolls as a mechanism that always works toward a rate 
hike. 
  He cited the use of the government's fiscal investment and 
loan fund as one option in replacing the pool system in which 
funds collected by drivers finance new highway construction. 
  The government announced Wednesday it will suspend rates for 
services such as telephones, rents on government-owned houses 
and public transportation. The plan was approved by Friday's 
cabinet meeting. 
  On utility charges, Hata said the issue should be separated 
from charges subject to the latest rate hike freeze. Rates on 
gas and electricity were cut last November as part of efforts to 
pass on to consumers the companies' windfall profits from the 
yen's appreciation against the dollar. The companies said the 
cuts would be effective until the end of September this year. 
  What to do after September is a matter to be handled by the 
industries concerned after taking into account various economic 
factors like crude oil prices and exchange rates, Hata said. 
  On the growing difficulty of female college graduates to 
find 
jobs, with many companies refusing to hire women, citing the 
recession, the trade minister said he will ask the business 
community to "refrain from hesitating" to recruit such students. 
The tendency, if covered by the overseas media, would undermine 
the reputation of Japanese corporations, Hata said. He said he 
will make the request when he meets leaders of the Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren) next Tuesday. 
  Turning to the ongoing Japan-U.S. informal trade talks in 
Washington, Hata said he has yet to receive any information 
about the meeting. The two countries began subcabinet-level 
talks Thursday in a bid to find common ground for resuming the 
stalled negotiations on a new bilateral trade framework.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The government's freeze on 
public service charge hikes was "politically necessary," 
economic planning chief Yoshio Terasawa said Friday [20 May], 
but he expressed concern about the move's across-the-board 
nature. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata had to order the freeze to 
bolster consumer psychology and help the economy, the director 
general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) told a regular 
press conference after a morning cabinet endorsed the freeze. 
  "I think the very fact that it is across-the-board is 
meaningful" for beleaguered consumers, Terasawa said. But he 
said he wants to "respect" the EPA's position that hikes in 
public service charges should be decided case by case. 
  He said the move will have little effect on overall prices, 
which are quite stable in Japan's still-sluggish economy, noting 
that the EPA wants some prices to fall, to reduce disparities 
with overseas prices. But he said the freeze "avoids the 
negative effect" of more increases. 
  In his abrupt decision Wednesday, Hata said the government 
must show the people it is taking the same bitter cost-cutting 
medicine as private enterprises in their restructuring efforts. 
But the move to freeze for the rest of the year a vast array of 
rate hikes needing government approval, and a request to local 
governments to do the same, angered Japan's bureaucracy. Public 
opposition by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito was labeled a 
bureaucratic "coup d'etat" by one newspaper Friday. 
  Some cabinet members called at the morning's meeting for a 
drastic overhaul of the system for setting public service 
charges, such as highway tolls, utility rates and transportation 
fares, Terasawa said.

  [Text] Tokyo, may 20 KYODO -- Agriculture Minister Mutsuki 
Kato called Friday [20 May] for an overhaul of the present 
system of calculation for public service rates. 
  Kato made the remark after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
government endorsed a freeze on public service charges until the 
end of the year. 
  It is necessary to make a thorough review of the calculation 
system rather than merely postpone rate hikes, he said.

  [Text] Sendai, May 20 KYODO -- Opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono said Friday that 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is likely to choose a cabinet 
resignation en masse if a no-confidence motion is adopted. 
  Kono told a press conference he thinks Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama's call for dissolving the 
Diet through dialogue is intended to keep political reform alive. 
  In a meeting with Hata in Tokyo on Tuesday, Kono indicated 
that the LDP would submit a no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet after the Diet enacts the fiscal 1994 national budget. 
  Kono told a press conference that Hata "is likely to select 
resignation en masse under the circumstance generally 
envisaged," rather than call a snap election of the House of 
Representatives. 
  Kono said, "it is necessary to do away with the weak 
minority 
government." 
  "People can see what (Hata's) cabinet is like in 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget starting next 
week," Kono said. 
  The LDP will question the cabinet's policy at the lower 
house 
budget committee, assessing the timing for submitting the motion 
in a way that the people can support, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- A director of a key 
committee in the House of Representatives from Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], a core party in the ruling coalition, was 
removed from the post after criticizing his boss, Ichiro Ozawa, 
party officials said Thursday [19 May]. 
  Koichiro Aino was replaced by Morio Kimura, another 
Shinseito 
member, as a director of the lower house steering committee, the 
officials said. 
  A senior party official said the change is a regular one. 
But the sudden change is widely regarded as punishment for 
Aino, who described the formation of a joint parliament group in 
the lower house which triggered the withdrawal of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) from the coalition as a blunder by Ozawa. 
  Aino's remarks angered Ozawa, the chief coalition 
strategist, 
and he later retracted them. 
  The SDP walked out of the coalition in late April after the 
abrupt formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group, excluding 
the party. The SDP's withdrawal meant Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata had to form a minority government for the first time in 39 
years.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Four House of 
Representatives members on Friday [20 May] defected from former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP] due to 
differences with the party leadership. 
  They are Satoshi Arai, Yukio Edano, Yuichi Takami and Seiji 
Maehara, all of whom were elected to the lower house for the 
first time on the JNP ticket in last July's general election. 
  "It was tough and painful to part from our colleagues...We 
will continue doing our utmost to revamp Japan's politics," Arai 
said at a news conference. 
  The four will form a new parliamentary group and seek a 
tie-up with the 18-member parliamentary group of new party 
Sakigake [Harbinger]/Seiun and new party Mirai. 
  They said their reason for quitting the two-year-old party 
rested in the formation of a new parliamentary group, Kaishin, 
in late April. 
  Kaishin was abruptly established by ruling coalition 
parties, 
excluding the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a move that led to 
the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition and forced Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first minority government in 
39 years. 
  The lawmakers also noted they want to pursue a management 
style that differs from the JNP's, though they share political 
goals. 
  Edano said he shares political ideals with a number of JNP 
members and hopes he can join forces with them in the future. 
  On Thursday, Edano and Takami revealed they would quit the 
JNP, and Arai and Maehara decided to follow suit on Friday. 
  Last month, three JNP members left the party after Hosokawa 
and his party leadership formed closer ties with key coalition 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's 
core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. The three defectors 
established the Seiun group. 
  Wtih the latest breakaway, the JNP's strength in the lower 
house is pared down to 33. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told a 
news conference the defection from the JNP -- a move that also 
reduces the strength of the ruling coalition -- is regrettable. 
  But the top government spokesman also declared the governing 
forces will stay united and march forward despite the departure.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prosecutors demanded Friday 
[20 May] former Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami be 
sentenced to three and half years in prison for allegedly taking 
bribes in a shares-for-favor scandal involving Tokyo-based job 
information firm Recruit Co. 
  The Tokyo District Court is expected to hand down a ruling 
by 
the end of the year after Fujinami, 61, and his lawyers deliver 
their final submissions July 14, court officials said. 
  He is the first suspect from within the political circle to 
face a ruling in the series of Recruit scandals that jolted 
Japanese politics in the late 1980s. 
  Fujinami was charged with receiving 10,000 unlisted shares 
and 20 million yen in checks from Recruit in exchange for 
political favors.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The outgoing chairman of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said Thursday 
[19 May] he feels he has finished playing a major role in the 
Japanese business community. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa made the remark at his last news conference 
as 
chief of Japan's top business lobby. 
  He will be replaced by Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota 
Motor Corp., as Keidanren chief when he retires from his post in 
a general meeting of the organization on May 27. 
  Hiraiwa, who is also adviser to Tokyo Electric Power Co., 
was 
appointed as Keidanren chairman in December 1990. 
  During his three-and-a-half-year term, he faced various 
problems resulting from political turmoil and a prolonged 
recession.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's previous vice 
finance minister, Mamoru Ozaki, was appointed Friday [20 May] by 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to head People's Finance Corp., 
replacing Sadaaki Hirasawa. 
  Hirasawa, also a former vice finance minister, is widely 
expected to be become president of the Bank of Yokohama in June. 
  People's Finance Corp. is a government-run firm that 
provides 
low-interest loans to small businesses. 
  A rash of such high-profile appointments recently has raised 
anew the issue of "amakudari," the "descent from heaven" of 
ranking bureaucrats to influential private-sector positions.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor 
Yasushi Mieno on Friday [20 May] repeated his earlier view that 
the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage. 
  The central bank chief told the Budget Committee of the 
House 
of Councilors that the Japanese economy has been showing some 
signs of firmness since the beginning of the year, especially 
related to consumer spending. 
  However, he said, "there is a need to closely watch whether 
these signs can be sustained and spread to other sectors." 
  Mieno said the current state of the economy is different 
from 
a similar state the economy was in spring last year in that 
inventory cuts and restructuring have been more pronounced this 
time around. 
  He said that dampening factors remain, however, such as the 
still unhealthy balance sheets of financial institutions. 
  Mieno was responding to questions by Kiyoharu Ishiwata, a 
member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The economy has yet to show 
that it is about to recover but the long economic slump is not 
worsening, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Friday [20 May]. 
  "Japan's economic growth appears to have stopped weakening," 
the BOJ said in its monthly economic review, using almost the 
same words as a month ago. "However, there are no clear 
indications of imminent recovery." 
  Personal consumption, a main engine of growth, "is picking 
up 
gradually," while housing and public-sector investment are 
strong, but corporate capital spending is still falling, the 
report says. 
  Job growth remains slow, the central bank said, but it noted 
a halt to the falling ratio of job offers to seekers. 
  Money supply growth remains low due to weak lending by 
banks, 
the report asserts, saying rises in March and April to the top 
of the BOJ's forecast range resulted from "portfolio shifts 
between money and other financial assets" not counted in the 
money supply. 
  On inflation, it says domestic wholesale prices are falling 
on weak demand and cheaper imports, service prices are stable 
and consumer price increases remain low. 
  Industrial production "has virtually stopped decreasing," 
the 
central bank said, although it noted that the trade ministry 
expects declines in April and May in the wake of stepped-up 
spending before the end of the fiscal year. 
  Capital spending continues to fall among manufacturers -- 
except for such bright spots as semiconductors, liquid crystal 
displays and cellular telephones -- and is stagnant among 
nonmanufacturers, the report says. 
  It notes recent rises in Japan's trade surplus but says the 
current-account surplus "has peaked" due to "larger deficits in 
invisible and transfer accounts."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's industrial 
production in March increased 4.6 percent from the preceding 
month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
said in a revised report Friday [20 May]. 
  The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and 
manufacturing sectors came to 92.7 against a base of 100 for 
1990. The growth compares with a 3.3 percent rise in a 
preliminary report released in late February, MITI said. 
  The shipment index, given as 95.3, increased 4.8 percent 
from 
February, revised upward from a 3.9 percent rise in the 
preliminary report. 
  The inventory index, at 105.4, fell 1.1 percent against a 
preliminary 0.8 percent drop. 
  The index of the inventory-to-sales ratio, at 112.7, 
declined 
5.3 percent compared with a 4.5 percent fall in the earlier 
report. 
  With the latest statistics, Japan's industrial output has 
scored ups and downs alternately in the past eight months. 
Before adjustments, March industrial production decreased a 
revised 2.1 percent from a year earlier, extending a record 
string of year-to-year declines to 30 months. Unadjusted 
shipments fell a revised 2.6 percent from a year before and 
unadjusted inventories a revised 3.4 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's annual corporate 
earnings season set in Friday [20 May], with the number of 
companies releasing their earnings for the latest business year 
ended March 31 peaking at around 250. 
  The companies make up about 20 percent of Japanese companies 
closing their books on March 31. 
  The so-called Kabutocho Press Club within the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange was packed like a morning commuter train with reporters 
and corporate financial officers for earnings announcements. 
  The effects of the prolonged recession were reflected in the 
results, with many companies reporting, "sales went down because 
of the recession," or "the high yen cut into profits." 
  Until now, some 350 companies have announced their results 
for their latest business year, showing a decline of some 6 
percent in combined sales and a fall of some 14 percent in 
combined pretax profits from year-earlier levels. 
  "If steel and auto companies which announce their results 
next week are added up, pretax profits will go down further, 
probably by more than 20 percent," an economist at a private 
think tank said.

Nations statement that Australia has agreed to commit troops to 
a UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. A UN spokesman had named 
nine countries, including Australia, what he said would send 
infantry troops to join the UN force. But an Australian 
spokesman said that while the government has committed in 
principle to a peacekeeping mission to Rwanda, it had not 
decided what form its involvement would take. He said Australia 
is awaiting an assessment of the Rwandan situation by a UN 
observer team. The UN plans to send 5,500 troops to Rwanda 
where hundreds of thousands of people are reported to have died 
in ethic violence.

  [Text] Australia could double its exports to the Indian 
market to around $2 billion by the end of the decade if local 
business attitudes are changed, according to a major Federal 
Government review. 
  But the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's East Asia 
Analytical Unit warns that Australia's current market share in 
India will drop "unless Australia increases its efforts in 
India". 
  At a preview of India's Economy at the Midnight Hour: 
Australia's India Strategy, the unit's director, Dr 
Meredith Borthwick, said the private sector will have to drop 
its outdated and largely negative image of the subcontinent. 
  Dr Borthwick acknowledged that India was a difficult market 
but "it will repay the perseverence required". 
  The new report -- to be launched by the Minister for Trade, 
Senator McMullan in Melbourne today -- says the Indian business 
environment is not well regarded, even by Australian companies 
which have been successful there. 
  "This negative image must be redressed. Although some 
difficulties remain, old stereotypes no longer reflect the 
realities of the Indian market. India is changing, and our 
competitors have been quick to realise this," the report says. 
  "More and more, India is being hailed as the `new tiger' 
[with annual growth rates of around 6 percent] and its economic 
prospects are being compared favourably to the other giant in 
the region, China" 
  The report chronicles the transformation of India's 
political 
and economic climate over the past three years. Key changes 
include big reductions in industrial tariffs, the easing of 
foreign investment rules, the abolition of licensing 
requirements for industrial ventures, tax cuts and increased 
capital market flexibility. The report says the Indian reform 
process has passed the point of no return. 
  "Three years of courageous, bold and rapid liberalisation 
have sufficiently entrenched deregulation trends in both the 
popular middle-class thinking and among most economic actors and 
opinion leaders." 
  Australia last year enjoyed a trade surplus with India of 
$513 million with Australian exports of $920 million against 
imports from India of $407 million. The report concludes that 
"Australia could double its annual exports to the Indian market 
by the year 2000" but warns that "opportunistic, ill-researched 
approaches bear high risks."

  [Text] A new political party is being formed in Vanuatu by 
a breakaway faction of the National United Party [NUP] of former 
prime minister Father Walter Lini. The People's Democratic 
Party is led by three government ministers who were expelled 
from the United Party last week. They are Deputy Prime Minister 
Sethy Regenvanu, Health Minister Edward Tabisari, and 
Communications Minister Cecil Sinker. The three make up the 
junior partner in the coalition government of the Union of 
Moderate Parties. They have been joined by the former 
agriculture minister, Oneyn Tahi, who accused the NUP of being 
dictatorial when he resigned from the party. 
  Mr. Regenvanu said in launching the new party last night 
that 
the objective of the People's Democratic Party would be a fair 
sharing of resources to the advancement of Vanuatu and its 
people.

  [Text] All foreigners participating in the East Timor 
Conference will be barred from entering the country. This was 
the order given by the president to the Departments of Justice 
and Foreign Affairs. 
  Ramos said that the entry of foreign nationals attending the 
conference on East Timor is inimical to national interests. 
  The eight foreigners who will be banned from entering the 
country are: Jose Ramos Horta, Carmel Budjardjo, Jose Gutierrez, 
Lim-Siou Liong, A. Perera, Maria Alkatiri, Juan Feberer, and 
Jaoa Carrascalao. They will not be given visas. Visas already 
issued will be canceled, while those foreigners already in the 
country may be deported. Only foreign exchange students will be 
allowed to attend the conference.

<F P=106> ["Text" of report issued by former Foreign Affairs Secretary </F>
Raul Manglapus on 19 May; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] We have just returned from Jakarta, where we carried 
out upon the instructions of President Ramos a special mission 
to Indonesia. We conveyed a letter from the president to 
President Suharto concerning the proposed holding in the 
Philippines of the meeting on East Timor, an event over which 
the Indonesian Government had expressed its deep concern. We 
had the occasion to exchange views on the subject with His 
Excellency Ali Alatas, the foreign minister of Indonesia, and 
the other officials of the Indonesian Government. 
  Our talks were characterized by utmost cordiality. We 
assured the Indonesian Government of the Philippines' continuing 
support for the territorial integrity of the Republic of 
Indonesia, including the province of East Timor, support which 
President Ramos had earlier reaffirmed in connection with the 
proposed conference on East Timor. We recalled the declarations 
of President Ramos, Vice President Estrada, and other Philippine 
officials that they shared Indonesia's concern over the 
implications of the conference. We made it clear that President 
Ramos had firmly dissociated the Philippine Government from the 
conference. At the same time, we pointed out that the event was 
being organized with Philippine private groups and individuals 
as formally the hosts, and we stressed that the Philippine 
Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and freedom of 
speech and that therefore the Philippine Government is unable to 
prevent, under normal circumstances, the conference from taking 
place. However, we informed the Indonesian officials that 
everything would be done in accordance with the Constitution and 
our laws to ensure that this unfortunate development does not 
harm the friendly relations between the Philippines and 
Indonesia. 
  Foreign Minister Alatas expressed the gratitude of President 
Suharto to President Ramos for sending our mission. He conveyed 
the Indonesian Government's appreciation for our explanation and 
for the reiteration of the Philippine Government support for the 
Indonesian position on East Timor. He stated that other 
Indonesian officials had done and have done that Indonesia 
understood and respect the Philippine position on constitutional 
rule and human rights. [sentence as heard] He declared, 
however, that the proposed conference is not simply a matter of 
human rights. We noted Minister Alatas' observation that the 
scheduled meeting was neither a gathering of human rights nor an 
academic exercise but as part of a political action plan of a 
small secessionist exile group, using the Philippine conference 
to subvert Indonesia's sovereignty on East Timor. We noted that 
this small secessionist exile group was giving the central 
direction in the organization of the conference. 
  We recalled the invaluable role which Indonesia has played 
in 
the Organization of Islamic Conference with respect to our 
secessionist problem. The mission expressed the Philippines' 
gratitude for this. We and the Indonesians agreed to continue 
exchanging views and information on this matter and on the 
Philippine-Indonesian relations in general.

  [Text] The Department of Interior and Local Government 
[DILG] will transform the mineral-rich Kalayaan [Freedom] chain 
of islands [part of Spratly Islands claimed by the Philippines] 
into one of the country's viable local government unit. The 
Kalayaan Islands is considered to be the next flash point among 
the Asian claimant nations. DILG Acting Secretary Alexander 
Aguirre said the transformation will be in line with earlier 
plans of the Cabinet Cluster "E" to attract settlers in the 
area. Aside from the Philippines, the other claimant nations 
which have already established military units in the areas 
include Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and China.

  [Text] Major General Alfredo Filler, Armed Forces of the 
Philippines [AFP] vice chief of staff, stressed that the members 
of the Alex Boncayao Brigade involved in the killing of U.S. 
Colonel James Rowe are covered by the government's amnesty 
program. Filler said that the killers were captured and 
punished. They, however, still have the right to apply for the 
amnesty program. 
  It will be recalled that the U.S. Government objected to the 
granting of amnesty to the three New People's Army rebels who 
killed Rowe while on his way to JUSMAG [Joint United States 
Military Advisory and Planning Group] in Quezon City during the 
latter part of 1980. 
  According to Filler, the Philippines will not be violating 
the diplomatic agreement which it signed wherein the government 
will give protection to American nationals in the country. 
Filler clarified that the agreement does not stipulate the 
banning of parole or amnesty.
