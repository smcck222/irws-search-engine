  [Text] A new political party, reportedly set up to 
accommodate defectors from the Phalang Tham Party, was formally 
unveiled yesterday. Founding member Phiraphong Thanomphongphan 
said his Lak Siam (Siam Principle) Party submitted its 
application for registration to the Interior Ministry last week. 
  Phiraphong, a former Phalang Tham MP for Bangkok, said his 
party has a lot of support among businessmen, permanent 
officials, ordinary citizens, and politicians in existing 
parties. 
  Phiraphong said the party registrar is expected to endorse 
the application today and Lak Siam is ready to begin recruiting 
members. Phiraphong was seen yesterday visiting the office of 
Deputy Prime Minister and Phalang Tham Leader Bunchu 
Rotchanasathian several times before holding his press 
conference at Government House. 
  It was rumoured earlier that Phiraphong's party was being 
established for defectors from the Phalang Tham Party, 
especially those holding Cabinet posts and those who joined the 
Phalang Tham just before the last general election. Speculation 
was that most Phalang Tham ministers are disliked by members of 
the party's powerful religious wing, who want them out. 
  When asked about the rumour, Phiraphong had a question of 
his 
own: is Phalang Tham close to collapse? Phiraphong said Lak 
Siam's leader will have to be capable of working in either 
opposition or government. 
  Unconfirmed reports said Lak Siam had earlier failed to 
recruit former prime minister Anan Panyarachun to head the party.

businessmen. 
  During its stay in Vietnam, the Danish delegation was 
received by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and held talks 
with Tran Thong Giao, deputy chairman of the State Planning 
Commission. Both sides noted that economic cooperation between

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Denmark has wiped off a debt of over $15 million 
for Vietnam. The decision was laid during the working visit to 
Vietnam by Ms. Helle Aid Degn, minister of development 
cooperation of Denmark. Following is our radio comment on the 
decision and relations between Vietnam and Denmark: 
  This decision positively contributes to the national 
construction of Vietnam. Vietnam faces many difficulties and 
still lacks the capital for national development, especially in 
the construction of standard infrastructure. 
  Since 1992, when Denmark resumed its cooperative relations 
with Vietnam, relations between the two countries have developed 
significantly. Denmark added Vietnam to its list of regular aid 
recipients. Denmark has also granted $14 million to Vietnam. 
The grant will be used to renovate and develop projects which 
shall be assisted by Denmark such as the Hoang Thach Cement 
Factory, the La Nga Sugarcane Factory, and the Dalat Water 
Supply Program. The Danish Government was pleased with 
Vietnam's maintenance and effective use of these projects. 
  Ms. Helle Aid Degn, during her stay in Vietnam, agreed with 
the Vietnamese Government that bilateral relations between the 
two countries have developed. She also met with Vietnamese 
senior officials to map out the long-term strategy for 
cooperation between the two countries, mainly in the field of 
maintenance, the process of sea products, manufacture and 
distribution of cement, and in water supply programs. 
  Denmark will also help Vietnamese programs on eradication of 
famine and alleviation of poverty, environment protection, and 
mother and child care. The decision to wipe out Vietnam's debt 
is also a long-term strategic cooperation between the countries 
and it creates favorable conditions for long-term and stable 
cooperation in economy and trade between Vietnam and Denmark.

<F P=106> ["Communique" issued by the National Assembly Standing </F>
Committee in Hanoi; date not given] 
  [Text] The National Assembly [NA] Standing Committee met 
from 11-19 May 1994 under the chairmanship of National Assembly 
Chairman Nong Duc Manh. Attending the meeting was Vice 
President Nguyen Thi Binh. 
  1. The committee reviewed the preparations for the fifth 
session of the Ninth National Assembly scheduled to open on 26 
May 1994. The committee commended the government, National 
Assembly agencies and other organs concerned, National Assemly 
delegations, and National Assembly deputies for having made 
adequate preparations to guarantee success for the session. The 
committee highly appreciated the positive efforts of people of 
all walks of life, sectors, and echelons in contributing views 
on a number of bills. The committee studied and contributed 
suggestions to a number of bills that had been reviewed based on 
the views contributed by the people. The committee requested 
the various compiling committees and other National Assembly 
committees concerned to continue perfecting those draft 
documents so that they can be presented to the National Assembly 
at an early date. 
  The committee also gave its opinions about key issues and 
fundamental contents of the draft civil code and requested the 
compiling committee and the National Assembly Judiciary 
Committee to continue perfecting this draft document before 
soliciting the views of National Assembly deputies. 
  The committee studied the government reports on the 
implementation of the National Assembly's resolution on a number 
of tasks for 1994 and other National Assembly's resolutions on 
other tasks for the first six months of the year, especially the 
results of budget allocations and fulfillment of the 1994 state 
budget; the development of the movement for thrift and against 
wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling; and diplomatic 
achievements. 
  The committee commended the government for having taken 
quick 
steps to implement the National Assembly's resolutions from the 
very beginning of 1994 and for having worked out policies and 
measures to direct all sectors and echelons in motivating people 
throughout the country to effect positive changes and overcome 
difficulties step by step, thus successfully materializing the 
objectives set by the National Assembly's resolutions. 
  The committee took into account the fact that our state's 
diplomatic activities in early 1994 had contributed to 
strengthening our ties with regional countries and to broadening 
our relations with friendly countries worldwide. 
  The committee highly valued the fine results of the recent 
official friendship visits to the Republic of Indonesia and the 
Islamic Republic of Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to the 
Republic of India by National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, 
and to the Union of Myanmar [Burma] by Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. All those visits have contributed to strengthening the 
friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and the 
aforementioned countries. They have also enhanced our country's 
prestige and position in the world and served the cause of 
national defense and construction. The committee requested the 
Government to continue to perfect reports before they can be 
presented to the upcoming session of the National Assembly. 
  2. The National Assembly Standing Committee approved the 
following three bills: 
  -- The bill on protecting national defense projects and 
military areas. This bill is aimed at strengthening state 
management; enhancing responsibility of state agencies, armed 
units, socioeconomic organizations, and citizens in preserving 
and protecting national defense projects and military areas, 
thereby ensuring the capabilities in national defense and in 
serving the cause of national construction and defense. 
  -- The revised bill on income tax levied on high-income 
earners. This bill is aimed at ensuring social justice and 
mobilizing more revenue for the state budget. 
  -- The revised bill on amending and supplementing some 
articles of the law on land and house taxation to strengthen the 
law on land and the law on agricultural land use. 
  Also at this conference, the National Assembly Standing 
Committee reviewed the draft bill on rights and obligations of 
organizations at home which have been allocated and leased with 
land; and the draft bill on rights and obligations of foreign 
organizations and individuals who lease land in Vietnam for 
submission to the National Assembly at the upcoming session. 
The National Assembly will also consider the bill on tax levied 
on the transfer of rights on using land. This will serve as a 
basis for the National Assembly Standing Committee to consider 
and adopt relevant draft bills at its next meetings. 
  3. The National Assembly Standing Committee heard a report 
on 
the results of its investigation team led by National Assembly 
Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy on its inspection tour to Lam Dong 
Province to ensure national defense and security to comply with 
the spirit of the Ninth National Assembly's fourth session 
resolution. 
  The National Assembly Standing Committee approved the team's 
report and asked the government and agencies concerned and 
localities to study and implement the team's proposals. 
  The National Assembly Standing Committee welcomed the Lam 
Dong people and combatants' efforts in developing socioeconomic 
situation, maintaining national defense and security, improving 
the people's daily life. It urged the province to strive to 
consolidate and strengthen the all-people unity, improve 
socioeconomic development, and maintain national defense and 
security while resolving pressing issues as raised by the 
inspection team. 
  4. The National Assembly Standing Committee made a decision 
on the number of chief judges and judges of appeal of the 
Supreme People's Court, on the table of organization of the 
Supreme People's Court and of the central military court for 
1994, and approved the assistant machinery of the Supreme 
People's Court. 
  The National Assembly Standing Committee also decided on the 
change of members of the Council for Selection of Judges of 
Provincial and City People's Courts under the direct management 
of the central government, judges of military regional courts 
and courts at corresponding level, and judges of regional 
martial courts.

  [Text] Implementing the party Central Committee's third 
plenum resolution on renovating and revamping the party, the 
nation has made encouraging achievements over the past two years 
in its efforts to train and develop newly-recruited party 
members. Almost 50,000 new party members were admitted during 
1993, an increase of 38 percent over the previous year. Among 
these, 43 percent were admitted by grassroots party 
organizations, the highest percentage in several years. 
  The An Giang provincial party organization has concentrated 
its efforts on developing party chapters in hamlets and housing 
clusters. In 1993, about 50 percent of the province's 
newly-recruited party members came from rural areas. Many came 
from 21 of the 26 hamlets that had never before admitted party 
members. 
  Party organizations in Thai Binh and Hai Hung Provinces also 
admitted more members as a result of their efforts in holding 
refresher courses for cadres responsible for recruiting new 
party members. 
  Party organizations in the Army have paid special attention 
to recruiting officers, non-commissioned officers, and national 
defense and professional personnel. In 1993, the Army admitted 
more than 8,000 new party members, 95 percent of them under the 
age of 30.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 22 -- By mid-April this year, farmers 
in southern Vietnam had basically finished harvesting nearly 1.1 
million hectares of the winter-spring rice crop, the 19th such 
crop since the liberation. Prior to that there had not been any 
such crop. The output of this winter spring crop is estimated to 
be about 4.5 million tons, which is equal to the annual rice 
output in the early years after the liberation. 
  Currently, farmer in southern Vietnam cultivate 3 rice crops 
a year :winter-spring, summer-autumn, and the year-end rice 
crop. The cultivated area of each crop is never less than 1 
million hectares. In the early years after liberation, farmers 
in southern Vietnam, mainly in the Mekong delta, cultivated only 
one rice crop, the year-end rice crop, and obtained an average 
yield of about 1.8 tons/hectare. Two more rice crops were 
gradually introduced the winter-spring and the summer-autumn and 
these became the main rice crops of the year instead of the 
year-end crop. 
  During the years of implementing the party's directive 100 
up 
to 1988 the area growing the winter-spring and summer-autumn 
rice was expanded to about 600,000 ha with an average 
productivity of 4.5 tons/ha for the winter spring crop and 3.5 
tons/ha for the summer-autumn crop. 
  Next came resolution 10 of the party's politburo, which 
called for renewal of the management of agricultural production. 
This has given a real boost to agricultural production and to 
the national rice output. 
  Besides increasing rice crops in a year, southern farmers 
were also called upon to reclaim waste land from the Plain of 
Reeds, Long Xuyen quadrangle and the western area of Hau River 
for rice production. Within a few years, about 200,000 ha have 
been reclaimed from these areas and put under two rice crops a 
year. Now, Tien Giang, Long An and Dong Thap Provinces in the 
Plain of Reeds cultivate 529,000 ha with rice. The average food 
share produced by farmers in the plain of reeds, Long Xuyen 
quadrangle and the western area of Hau River ranges between 1.5 
and 2.5 tons per capita. These 3 areas are now producing an 
output of 5 million tons of commodity rice a year, more than the 
total yearly rice output of south Vietnam before liberation. 
  Inspired by their achievements since the start of 
renovation, farmers in southern Vietnam are continuing to adjust 
the structure of agricultural production and renew the rural 
economy in the direction of industrialisation and modernisation, 
thus creating conditions for the country to integrate its 
economy into the world economy.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 23 -- This year, investment in 
mountain areas would increase by two times compared with the 
1993 figure, said Mr. Hoang Duc Nghi, cabinet minister, chairman 
of the Ethnic Minorities and Mountain Regions Committee, at a 
press conference held here on May 21. 
  While introducing the government's policies and measures on 
the socio-economic development in mountain areas, Mr Nghi said 
that the government has decided to supply key mountain areas 
with kinds of goods free-of-charge namely iodized silt, 
medicines, notebooks and gasoline for lighting and make 
subsidized prices and transportation cost to seven kinds 
including then above-said ones and fabrics, insecticide and 
fertilizers. In the coming period, he added, his committee was 
preparing to work out a socio-economic development project for 
the Hmong and Thai minority groups.

  [Text] Le Xuan Trinh, minister of state in charge of the 
the government office, held a news conference at his office on 
the afternoon of 23 May to make public the situation regarding 
the implementation of various government programs of action 
since early this year and to outline the implementation of a 
socioeconomic development plan for the last six months of 1994. 
  According to Minister Le Xuan Trinh, the socioeconomic 
situation in our country has since early this year continued to 
be stable and developed. Along with the stability and 
development momentum generated since 1993, generally, in this 
year's winter-spring crop, almost all localities in the entire 
country -- except for a number of central provinces where there 
were difficulties arising from crop failure -- attained or 
exceeded their targets in both area and yield. It is estimated 
that the grain ouput in the first half of the year may reach 
more than 11 million tons, increasing by 1 million ton over the 
same period last year. 
  Industrially, it is estimated that the gross production 
value 
in the first six months will attain 48 percent of the annual 
target, representing a 11-percent increase over the same period 
last year with local industrial ouput value increasing by 10 
percent. 
  A number of essential products such as electricity, coal, 
crude oil, steel, cement, electric motors, and the like have 
showed an increase with certain items increasing by nearly 20 
percent. 
  A number of key construction projects have been deployed 
such 
as those designed to improve and upgrade a number of segments of 
National Highway 1-A, to start construction of a project to 
channel gas onto the shoreline from the sea, and so forth. 
  Apart from the results obtained, over the past months, many 
difficulties and weaknesses in the implementation of the 
socioeconomic plan have, however, not been overcome, and the 
difficulties arising from budget inbalance are still 
particularly serious. Various sources of revenue obtained have 
not been able to offset requirements for spending in 
development. A number of key construction projects of the state 
that have been deployed in the past years continue to have 
difficulties in capital. The speed at which a number of 
projects have been being built is still slow. 
  Minister Le Xuan Trinh presented various guiding and 
operating measures of the government for the period ahead aimed 
at overcoming the aforementioned difficulities to ensure that 
the economic growth rate for this year will attain the target 
set by the National Assembly in its previous session. 
  At the news conference, Minister Le Xuan Trinh quoted the 
prime minister as hailing the contributions of the press to the 
government in its efforts to guide and run various programs of 
action in the past and expressing the hope that the mass news 
media will continue to support the government's activities in 
the period ahead. The mass news media must strive harder to 
disseminate information on the deployment and implementation of 
Government Resolution #38-CP, which calls for further renovating 
various newly promulgated administrative procedures in resolving 
works related to citizens and organizations.

  [Text] A Tatmadaw [Defense Services] column of the Eastern 
Command, acting on information, seized 3333.96 litres of acetic 
anhydride, used in refining heroin, from about 60 members of 
Khun Sa's SURA [Shan United Revolutionary Army] armed group 
after a 20-minute engagement with them on 13 May near Wunlon 
Village in Loilem Township. 
  The acid was in 126 containers. 
  The Tatmadaw column also impounded 62 pack-saddles from the 
armed group which fled in disarray after the battle. The seized 
acid is believed to be destined for opium refineries of Khun 
Sa's armed group, which are situated on the Myanmar 
[Burma]-Thailand border. 
  Acetic anhydride is an essential element in refining heroin. 
A kilo or a litre of the liquid is needed for producing a kilo 
of heroin. 
  Over 4,000 litres of acetic anhydride were also seized 
together with culprits from a truck which parked at Yayayekwin 
Ward, Taunggyi on 15 November last year. The acid was on its 
way to refineries of Khun Sa's Loimaw armed group, notorious for 
their drug trafficking and opium refining, which is their main 
business. 
  A Tatmadaw column of Eastern Command while on security duty 
also seized another 415.8 litres and nine horses and mules from 
a caravan on 5 December 1992 when they found a group of 
smugglers heading for the border near Narpaw Village in Kengtung 
Township. 
  The Tatmadaw and People's Police Force members are exposing 
and arresting drug smugglers who are trying to transport 
precursor chemicals to Khun Sa's SUA [Shan United Army]-SURA 
group who are selling their refined heroin on international drug 
market.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Caught red-handed"] </F>
  [Text] There is fresh evidence that the Khun Sa group is 
very much active refining opium, producing its most deadly 
derivative, heroin, which eventually finds its way to capitals 
of countries where the perpetrator of drug-related problems 
still finds allies, for obvious reasons. 
  Acetic anhydride, the most potent of precursor chemicals in 
the refining process, was on its way in bulk toward the 
tri-border area where the rogue has his den when a lightning 
raid by the Tatmadaw [Defense Services] sent the caravan people 
running for dear life. The chemicals, in 126 plastic containers, 
measure over 3,333 liters. Calculating in terms of what those 
familiar with the process say, the end product would be 3,333 
kilos of pure white heroin. 
  Where would the miscreant dispatch that much of lethal 
powder? Wherever there is demand. That is why the government 
here is pushing for demand reduction while striking at the root. 
The interdiction of the chemical caravan also left 62 
packsaddles in the hands of the law enforcers. Plain reasoning 
will help deduce that there were in the trail 62 pack 
horses/mules. Knowing they must jettison their precious 
contraband in order to save their lives, Khun Sa's men had taken 
to mule-back riding, which they would not have done under normal 
circumstances. Moreover, they had not crossed the Thanlwin 
[Salween] and were still far from where they were holed out. 
  There were earlier occasions, as divulged yesterday, when 
similar chemical contraband was seized, meaning the law 
enforcement personnel were able to deprive the refineries of the 
most essential element. From time to time, opium and various 
other forms of opiates and even psychotropic substances which 
were seized through Tatmadaw and police checks were destroyed in 
the presence of local and foreign newsmen, diplomats, and other 
guests. 
  There are times when the wholesale producer of heroin is 
portrayed as hero by the Western media. Seldom is he made a 
villain. The way we in Myanmar [Burma] see it, those like him 
who perpetrate such atrocities against humanity must be 
villains. Anyone with enough sense in his head would not bother 
to argue on his behalf. Plainly put, a drug man, and those who 
lend that person support of any measure, must be treated as 
intent on and actually doing harm to society worldwide. Caught 
red-handed. Indicted.

<F P=106> ["Perspectives: Ties Further Strengthened"] </F>
  [Text] The visit of the Prime Minister of the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam, Mr Vo Van Kiet, to the Union of Myanmar 
[Burma] at the invitation of the Prime Minister, Senior General 
Than Shwe, helps further strengthen the existing strong ties 
between our two Southeast Asian nations. 
  Though the two nations do not share common border, both had, 
each in a different way, to suffer being made a colony of a 
foreign power. Both nations had long and arduous freedom 
struggles, each in its own way, but nevertheless were able to 
expel the intruders. 
  Premier Vo Van Kiet noted with nostalgia the visit of his 
country's beloved leader, President Ho Chi Minh, to Myanmar 36 
years ago. 
  Today, both nations are bringing about economic reforms in 
similar ways. This has prompted Senior General Than Shwe to 
note that gaining knowledge from each other's experiences and 
developing mutually beneficial cooperation at the present moment 
would enable the two nations to see prosperity and move on 
toward creating a prosperous region. 
  Moreover, the Senior General, in his banquet speech, has 
also 
opined that from the mutual goodwill generated by the visit, the 
spirit of mutual assistance, goodwill and understanding, and 
unified cooperation will flourish in our region of Southeast 
Asia. 
  The Vietnamese Premier was also pleased to note that in the 
current new situation, the good traditional relations thus far 
nurtured by our two peoples are now gathering new momentum to 
further develop through sincere cooperation for the prosperity 
of the two nations. 
  The Senior General shares these views. He said he firmly 
believes that through the frank and open exchanges of views 
during the visit, the two nations will be able to enhance the 
mutual regard and understanding and the friendly ties which 
already exist. 
  Our two nations share common values, common ideals and 
similar culture. It is with this common identity and respect 
for each other that nations like ours must work together in 
order to accomplish what we wish to. 
  The Vietnamese Premier and entourage are taking in Mandalay 
and Pyin Oo Lwin in their short visit. They will at least be 
able to get a better idea of the socio-economic changes brought 
about in this country. 
  The reforms being brought about in our two countries and the 
initial strides we have made reflect the wisdom and integrity of 
the leaders and the peoples. We wish our distinguished guests 
an enjoyable stay.

  [Text] It has been learned that the military columns under 
the command of the Western Military Command and members of the 
Border Supervisory Units and local People's Police Force, and 
local residents are blocking the routes, crushing, and enjoying 
the victory over the members of the RSO [Rohingya Solidarity 
Organization] or Kalarzo terrorist organization, who cannot 
stand to see the all-around development programs being carried 
out for the country to become a peaceful, modern, and developed 
state. The members of the RSO, who are based on the other side 
of the country [near Bangladesh], entered into the Maungdaw area 
in Rakhine State in the last week of April to engage in 
destructive bombing activities to cause instability in the 
region. 
  Members of the RSO or Kalarzo terrorist group organized the 
youths who absconded from Myanmar to Bangladesh in 1991 by 
persuading and rewarding them. The group also provided the 
basic military training course to the youths. 
  The RSO or Kalarzo terrorists entered Maungdaw Township from 
the sea by schooners in the last week of April 1994. At 
midnight on 28 April 1994, nine out of 12 time bombs planted in 
12 different places in Maungdaw Township by these Kalarzo 
terrorists exploded at different times. One fire engine and 
some buildings were damaged, while four civilians were seriously 
wounded in the explosions. The remaining three unexploded time 
bombs were confiscated by the authorities. On the same night, a 
RSO or Kalarzo terrorist group comprising about 80 members 
entered Maungdaw, (Taunggyan), Minlut, Kyaukpandu regions in 
Mayu Taunggyaw, while another group comprising about 40 members 
entered northern part of Maungdaw, Bandoola, Aungthabye, 
(Minkanaung) regions in Mayu Taungdan. 
  The Kalarzo terrorists who entered the southern part of 
Maungdaw burned down the houses in Kyaukpandu Village at 0200 on 
1 May. Ten civilian houses were destroyed in the fire. The 
same group attacked the new ideal Zeyawaddy Village with small 
arms and burned down the houses at 0300 on 2 May. Two houses 
belonged to the village workers and 14 civilian houses were 
destroyed, while one civilian was killed and a 17-year-old girl 
was injured in the incident. 
  The Kalarzo terrorists who entered the northern part of 
Maungdaw burned down 13 houses in Shwetaung Village at 1030 on 
10 May. On 15 May, two civilians from Aungthabye Village were 
also injured when they stepped on a mine planted by these 
terrorists. 
  The military columns under the command of the Western 
Military Command, members of the Border Supervisory Units and 
local People's Police Force, and local residents -- a combined 
force of 26,000 people -- blocked the routes and attacked and 
crushed these terrorists. 
  Up to 19 May, they were 13 encounters with the terrorists. 
During the encounters, 52 terrorists were killed. The 
authorities also arrested eight people involved in planting the 
bombs in Maungdaw. The authorities also confiscated 16 assorted 
guns, 10 40- mm shells, 1,418 assorted mines, 522 hand grenades, 
3,611 rounds of assorted ammunition, five communication 
equipment, two schooners belonged to the Kalarzo terrorists, 
cash 400,400 kyats, and 153 takas. 
  It has been learned that these hand grenades, mines, and 
explosives are provided by the foreign terrorist organizations. 
During the clashes, four of our soldiers laid down their lives 
for the country while three were injured. 
  It has been learned that the military columns, members of 
the 
Border Supervisory Units and local People's Police Force, and 
local residents are searching and attacking the remaining RSO or 
Kalarzo terrorists.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To Regain Asia's Glory"] </F>
  [Text] The fact that China, despite its big power status, 
has never adopted an expansionist or colonial policy for 
centuries is a matter of historical record. Western 
apprehension of China's possible emergence as a new economic 
power in Asia that will use force to expand its territory is 
nothing but a delirium arising from jealousy and a lack of 
vision in understanding the culture of the world's biggest 
nation. On the other hand, history proves that only the 
Europeans have used conquest, either violent or peaceful, for 
gaining wealth or for self-defense. Yesterday in Beijing, Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed told a summit meeting 
entitled "China 1994," sponsored by the INTERNATIONAL HERALD 
TRIBUNE, that Asia would regain its place in world civilization 
if all Asian nations shared not only the benefit of China's 
modernization and economic development but also saw it as a 
positive contribution to progress in the region. 
  Surely, a prosperous and wealthy China will be able to 
become 
the engine of growth for the world in general and East Asia, 
including Southeast Asia, in particular. A diverse market will 
be created in China, whose 1.2 billion people enjoy only half of 
the U.S. wealth. Nevertheless, China still needs to import from 
Southeast Asian neighbors such commodities as cooking oil, gas, 
oil products, and manufactured goods. All Asian nations must 
grab this opportunity through economic cooperation with China 
instead of seeing this country as a giant to whom we should not 
be close. The entire region may benefit from China's wealth 
through trade and economic relations. 
  Strangely, nations that believe that China's emergence as an 
economic power will threaten their position are not equally 
apprehensive of the economic power of Japan, which colonized 
them half a century ago. In this regard, we agree with Dr. 
Mahathir that if Southeast Asian nations are not apprehensive of 
Japan, they should not be apprehensive of China either. If such 
a feeling is inevitable, they should be apprehensive of the two 
nations. We believe that the apprehension has been influenced 
by the Westerners, who do not want to see China as an economic 
power. For them, Japan's success in dominating the world 
economy and technology is enough to disprove their belief that 
the Europeans deserve to lead the world. 
  Being Asian, the countries in the region should dismiss the 
idea as there is no reason for them to help the Europeans thwart 
China's efforts and slow down Asia's efforts to gain their equal 
rights as world citizens. In addition, they should not be 
apprehensive of China's efforts to turn itself into a military 
power because any countries with strong economies would do the 
same. Moreover, seen from the perspective of international 
politics, China's emergence as a world politico-military power 
will at least counter the domination of the United States as a 
single superpower following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The Westerners are so apprehensive of such a situation that 
they have sought various pretexts, including alleged violations 
of human rights and freedom in China to gain international 
support for their efforts to isolate China. 
  We believe that all Asian nations are well aware of the 
West's decadent strategy because some of them have also become 
the victims of the same tactics. As the prime minister said, 
Asian nations have a different view of China because they 
understand China. China has introduced the socialist market 
economy in an attempt to avoid an economic and political anarchy 
plaguing Russia. We also understand how China will implement 
the process of revolutionizing its society to enable all its 
people to enjoy overall prosperity in the 21st century. 
  We are confident that progress in Asia will be complete and 
the continent will regain its place in world civilization if 
China's modernization and economic development succeeds. Those 
who have doubts over this possibility should refer to the 
Prophet Mohamed's appeal to his followers to go as far as China 
to gain knowledge some 1,414 years ago.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Apr--Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim 
stressed that losses suffered by the Central Bank in foreign 
currency trading are not sufficient to negate the bank's 
performance. 
  The deputy prime minister said that the Central Bank now has 
assets of more than 100 billion ringgit and that its 
international reserves have risen to 90 billion ringgit. 
  According to Anwar, this is the first time in the history of 
the Central Bank that assets and international reserves have 
reached such a strong position. He said the international 
reserves can cover the country's imports for eight months. 
  Anwar, who is also minister of finance, defended the Central 
Bank's reputation before the House of Representatives in 
response to criticism by opposition chief Lim Kit Siang, who had 
submitted an emergency motion concerning the 5.7-billion-ringgit 
loss sustained by the Central Bank in foreign currency 
transactions last year. 
  In 1992, the Central Bank also lost 9.3 billion ringgit in 
foreign exchange transactions. 
  House of Representatives Speaker Tan Sri Zahir Ismail 
permitted Kit Siang's motion to be discussed for one hour 
beginning at 1730 hours. The DAP [Democratic Action Party] 
leader was permitted to speak for 30 minutes, and Anwar, as 
representative of the government, was also allocated 30 minutes 
for discussion. 
  "Seeing that this motion concerns a specific subject, is in 
the public interest, requires haste, and falls under Standing 
Orders 18(3), I permit this motion to be discussed," Zahir said, 
which was received with desk slapping by the other opposition 
members. 
  In presenting the motion, Lim said the minister of finance 
needs to explain this matter (the losses), seeing that the 
minister last year gave a guarantee to Parliament that he 
himself would examine the Central Bank's foreign exchange 
transactions. 
  In discussing the motion, Anwar said that are only five 
central banks in the developing countries that can compete with 
the performance of the Malaysian Central Bank. The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) also acknowledges the strong position of the 
Central Bank. 
  "Our international reserves are almost twice as large as the 
foreign debt," he said. 
  In fact, Anwar said, the Central's Bank's performance is 
much 
better than when it was under previous finance ministers, such 
as in the days of Tun Tan Siew Sin and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. 
  "In 1967, when Tan was minister of finance, all of the 
Central Bank's international reserves disappeared in a moment 
when the British Government revalued the pound sterling. 
  "When Tengku Razaleigh managed the country's finances 
between 
1981 and 1984, the Central Bank suffered a loss of 9.5 billion 
ringgit in supporting the value of the ringgit 'to protect its 
image.' 
  "No commotion was made over those losses, however," Anwar 
said. 
  The deputy prime minister said that compared with Central 
Bank management in the past, the present Central Bank management 
is more honest and responsible. 
  "I could describe all the faults that the Honorable Lim Kit 
Siang sees in me," Anwar said, to which government supporters 
responded by slapping their desks. 
  Although the Central Bank is a part of the government, he 
said, the principle of the independence of the Central Bank is 
unshakable. 
  "The government and the minister of finance set a framework 
of policy, but daily management for achieving those policy 
objectives is the authority of the Central Bank," he explained. 
  Anwar guaranteed that the Malaysian Central Bank will no 
longer be involved in any foreign currency exchange transactions. 
  He said he had directed that such transactions be stopped as 
soon as it was learned in the middle of last year that losses 
had been suffered in those transactions. 
  "Since then, the Central Bank has gradually terminated all 
forward positions it took in transactions in 1992 and early 1993. 
  "Since then, there have been no futures market currency 
transactions by the Central Bank," he said. 
  The losses caused Central Bank Governor Tan Sri Jaffar 
Hussein to resign his post and take early retirement. Jaffar 
resigned on 31 March and acknowledged that the losses were his 
fault. 
  Anwar said that although he was willing to accept criticism 
in connection with Central Bank losses and Jaffar's resignation, 
such criticism must be fair. All parties must acknowledge the 
strength of the bank's financial position. 
  "I do not intend to defend existing weaknesses, but to 
reject 
and denigrate the Central Bank is absolutely unfair," he said. 
  As for Jaffar's situation, Anwar said he was a successful 
Central Bank governor and was respected in the region and 
throughout the world. 
  "His services and contributions were great and significant, 
but he steadfastly agreed with the principle of responsibility. 
  "In fact, he had asked to resign when the 
9.3-billion-ringgit 
losses were announced last year, but I rejected it because I 
felt Jaffar needed to resolve the problem first. 
  "If he had resigned at that time, the new governor would 
have 
been forced to make a new report on the losses, and that would 
clearly have complicated the matter," he said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Apr--Opposition chief Lim Kit Siang 
recommended that the government appoint a chairman of the Public 
Accounting Committee (PAC) from among opposition members of 
Parliament to investigate recent Malaysian Central Bank (BNM) 
losses in foreign currency exchange transactions. 
  He said such an appointment is necessary because the former 
PAC chairman, Datuk Dr. Affifuddun, was recently appointed 
parliamentary secretary for the Ministry of Finance. 
  Speaking in the discussion of an emergency motion this 
evening, he said the appointment of a PAC chairman from among 
opposition members of Parliament would mean that the government 
is proving that it is sincere and serious. 
  He said that despite the losses suffered during two 
successive years, the PAC has still been unable to act, because 
it does not have a chairman. 
  "The government needs to prove it is serious by creating a 
Royal Investigation Commission to investigate the financial 
scandal," he said. 
  He said he feels that the foreign exchange losses recently 
suffered by the Central Bank are the result of "gambling." 
  As an example, he cited the case of Mongolia, where two 
former central bank governors and three of their employees were 
prosecuted for negligence and exceeding their authority when 
they gambled in the foreign currency market, producing losses of 
$90 million. 
  In his lengthy discussion, Lim, who is a DAP member of 
Parliament from Jelutong, took part in urging the government to 
admit that it had injected 3 billion ringgit into the BNM's 
account to resolve the problem of a net shortage of 2.01 billion 
ringgit. 
  "The government was willing to do that in order to provide 
enough capital funds for the BNM to operate and to restore the 
power and image of the governor and other bank officials," he 
declared. 
  He questioned the capability of the BNM, which has acted as 
savior of financial institutions facing problems, because the 
BNM itself is in a financial crisis.

  [Text] The Suzhou Industrial Township project is only the 
beginning of a long-lasting economic cooperation between 
Singapore and China. 
  This was emphasised by both Deputy Prime Ministel Brigadier 
General [BG] (NS [National Service]) Lee Hsien Loong and Chinese 
Vice Premier Li Lanqing at a press conference held after the 
inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) for the 
Suzhou project yesterday. 
  Chaired jointly by BG Lee and Mr. Li, who is here on a 
five-day visit, the JSC is the bilateral body which oversees the 
development of the Singapore-style Suzhou Township. Its members 
include ministers and senior officials from key ministries and 
agencies of Singapore and China. 
  Among Singapore's representatives are Trade and Industry 
Minister Yeo Cheow Tong; the acting minister for national 
development, Mr. Lim Hng Kiang; and Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee 
Hean, the minister of state for finance. 
  BG Lee said that Singapore's software transfer programme to 
Suzhou should not be treated merely as a commercial investment 
project. 
  While Singapore has helped pay for part of the software 
transfer programme, "finance is not an important part of this 
project," he said. 
  If the project could, in some small way, help China prosper, 
it would be in Singapore's long-term interest, he noted. 
  Furthermore, he said Singapore would derive enormous 
benefits 
by developing "a long-term understanding with Chinese officials 
at many levels who would rise over the years." 
  A successful Suzhou, he added, would also "provide another 
outpost for Singapore in its efforts to go regional." 
  Under the software transfer arrangement, Singapore will help 
provide public administration and management skills needed for 
industrial township development to Suzhou officials. 
  So far, nine officials from Suzhou have been attached to 
various statutory boards in Singapore to learn about urban 
management as well as economic development and financial 
management. 
  If successful, BG Lee noted, the Suzhou experience could 
then 
be replicated in other township developments in China. 
  On its parts, said Mr. Li, China would adopt a very flexible 
approach towards the Suzhou project in order to help ensure its 
early success. 
  As an example, he pointed out that the Jiangsu Provincial 
Government had decided to make an exception by transferring the 
administrative authority of five towns which were affected by 
the township project, but which were not part of Suzhou City, to 
the Suzhou Municipal Government itself. 
  That would allow the Suzhou Industrial Township Authority, a 
Jurong Town Corporation-style statutory board that will be set 
up soon, to have better control over the entire township 
development. 
  BG Lee said Singapore will continue to share its experience 
on industrial township development with Suzhou as long as the 
latter finds it relevant and useful. But the initiative for the 
"software transfer" will have to come from the Chinese side, he 
noted. 
  "You have to decide what is relevant to China's needs which 
priority areas to focus on, and how to adapt Singapore's 
experience for use in Suzhou. Singapore will proceed as quickly 
and as extensively as the Chinese officials want to," he added.

  At the contact, the chief liaison officer of the KPA lodged 
a 
stern protest with the U.S. Forces side against the massive 
shipment of Patriot missiles and other new-type weapons into 
South Korea and accelerated reinforcement of Armed Forces in the 
Demilitarized Zone which lead the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war, and strongly urged it to 
immediately stop the reckless military action. 
  He said the grave military situation on the Korean peninsula 
urgently requires the establishment of a new peace arrangement. 
  He notified the U.S. Forces side that with a view to 
preventing a war on the Korean peninsula and establishing the 
peace arrangement, the supreme command of the KPA had instituted 
the Panmunjom mission of the KPA as a new negotiating body 
replacing the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] and appointed 
Lt. Gen. Yi Chan-pok its chief, Senior Col. Pak Yim-su deputy 
chief, Col. Yu Yong-chol chief liaison officer and Lt. Col. Sin 
Kun-song liaison officer.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 24 May Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] With the strong possibility of an agreement being 
reached to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
conditions are now ripe for the two countries to enter into 
negotiations on specific sectors, including automobiles. 
However, if the two sides fail to narrow the gap on such issues 
as objective criteria in advance, the negotiations may end up 
deadlocked similar to what happened during the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks in February. 
  To ensure that an agreement will be reached, the two 
countries will probably first go ahead with intensive 
negotiations on government procurement and insurance out of the 
three priority sectors and put off negotiations on the focal 
issues of automobiles and continuing the income tax cut. It is 
still uncertain whether an overall agreement can be reached 
before the bilateral summit meeting in July. 
  At the framework talks, the United States has insisted on 
incorporating objective criteria as targets for the future, 
while Japan has resisted such targets. Such a disagreement 
stalled the talks. The reason why the United States has 
compromised recently is because its previous tough stand toward 
Japan has contributed to a depreciation of the dollar and a 
decline in bond prices. It has realized that it would not be 
wise to have a prolonged deterioration of economic relations 
with Japan. 
  Japan and the United States were nearing substantial 
agreement on government procurement and insurance last February. 
"Once a conclusion is reached on the issue of objective 
criteria, an agreement will be forthcoming" (according to the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry). Through the 
"step-by-step solution" of dealing with the two sectors first, 
the two countries can also underscore their efforts toward 
reaching an agreement to offset speculative moves in the 
financial and foreign exchange markets. 
  Automobiles and auto parts, where the issue of expanding 
imports by Japan is pending, remain the toughest sector. The 
two sides still must resolve the question of the U.S. demand 
that the Japanese Government guarantee automakers' voluntary 
import plans. 
  In macroeconomic policy, Japan can hardly come up with a 
clear-cut statement on continuing with income tax cuts after FY 
1994 because of the prevailing political situation. Therefore, 
it is not certain whether Japan can come up with a solution 
acceptable to the United States. However, considering the 
pressure of the U.S. Congress on the administration in 
anticipation of the upcoming midterm elections, and market 
trends which may aggravate tension between Japan and the United 
States, both countries cannot afford to procrastinate.

  [Text] To urge foreign companies to join Japan's national 
projects in new energy development, including coal liquefaction 
and solar technology, the government will review the way it 
deals with intellectual property rights, such as patents. 
Currently, all intellectual property rights obtained through 
joint research in the same field belong to the Japanese 
Government. In the future, however, such intellectual property 
rights will be jointly owned by the government and the companies 
that take part in joint research and the companies will be able 
to utilize results of joint research for commercial purposes. 
By revising the way it deals with intellectual property rights, 
the government aims to avoid technological friction with Europe 
and the United States and plans to open the door to private 
companies to promote joint research. 
  Under the "system for research and development of industrial 
science and technology," the government has already approved 
joint ownership of intellectual property rights and is opening 
the door to foreign companies. However, it is the first time 
for the government to review its system in the new energy field. 
  Technological development projects regarding high-grade 
utilization of fossil fuels -- including development of 
alternatives to fossil fuel, such as solar power and geothermal 
energy generation and coal liquefaction -- will be the subject 
of the review. Currently, the government, with the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF] as main figures, is reviewing its regulations on 
dealing with intellectual property rights based on alternative 
energy laws (laws regarding promotion of development and 
introduction of alternative energy to oil). MITI plans to use 
the "joint international research for hydrogen utilization 
technology," which will get into its stride this fiscal year, as 
the first case to be executed under a new system. 
  So far, the New Energy and Industrial Development 
Organization (NEDO), which is the main body in charge of 
executing national projects, has been subletting national energy 
projects to private companies and universities. However, all 
patent and new ideas for practical use of research results 
belong to the Japanese Government so that the companies and 
universities are unable to use them. Because of this, in many 
cases, foreign companies, even if the government proposed joint 
international research, hesitated to take part in such joint 
studies. 
  Therefore, when it reviews regulations, the government will 
adopt a new system in which intellectual property rights will be 
jointly owned by the government and private companies. In 
addition, the government is studying the possibility of lowering 
patent fees and charging less when foreign companies use the 
results of joint research. 
  Through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), the government is also promoting discussions 
with the United States, Europe, and other countries to enable 
private companies to mutually join research projects of each 
country. Japan plans to make liberalization of projects related 
to energy as an eye-catcher at the discussions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasuhiro Nakasone, Liberal Democratic Party </F>
(LDP) member of the House of Representatives and former prime 
minister, by Soichiro Tahara, commentator and TV producer; date 
and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Man of Crisis: Ichiro 
Ozawa 
  [Tahara] Mr. Nakasone, you mentioned in your speech in 
London that the coalition government incorporates Komeito, which 
stems from the Soka Gakkai. How do you view this? 
  [Nakasone] I do not particularly think it has to be refused. 
Now that it is the time of multiple parties, it is all right to 
have men of different thoughts in the government. The Japan 
Communist Party is out of the question because it will not 
participate in the coalition even if it is solicited due to its 
way of thinking. I am in agreement with the idea that political 
parties other than the Communist Party can hold hands when their 
policies and ideas are tune with one another. However, it is 
always necessary to keep an eye on the method of management of 
political parties and their policy direction in order to 
safeguard democracy. In connection with Komeito's relationship 
with the religious organization, after reading an article 
contributed by Mr. Junya Yano in Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU, a question 
flashes through my mind of whether complete separation of 
religion from politics is observed internally. Whether such a 
problem contributes to bringing harmful effects is another 
question, but it is certain that caution is required. 
  [Tahara] Another point I would like to ask you is what you 
said in connection with Ichiro Ozawa and his Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] that the party is carrying on intraparty guidance 
based on authoritarianism with a tendency toward nationalism. 
Is this criticism or praise? 
  [Nakasone] It is criticism. Looking at Shinseito, I come to 
have questions such as whether such consultative bodies like the 
executive committee or general affairs committee of the party 
are working or whether decisions reached by a few people are 
relayed to the lower echelon. 
  For example, when the new electoral system of single-seat 
constituencies combined with proportional representation is 
introduced, the biggest problem will be how to keep despotism in 
check. In this connection, those who safeguard democracy should 
keep an eye at all times on whether despotism sprouts or whether 
it has a possibility of developing in that direction in the 
future. 
  [Tahara] Is there any indication that Shinseito will become 
despotic? 
  [Nakasone] I suspect it to be so. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Ozawa was a former LDP member and a junior to 
you, Mr. Nakasone. As his senior, what do you think of him? 
  [Nakasone] I remember telling Mr. Kanemaru about him, "He 
has the qualifications to be a "yokozuna" [sumo grand champion] 
someday, and also has elements of a rascal." 
  [Tahara] Rascal? 
  [Nakasone] And I added, "He has to correct them, because it 
is important not to suffer injury if he wants to be a grand 
champion." 
  [Tahara] What do you mean by elements of a rascal? 
  [Nakasone] He had a quarrel with newspapermen, don't you 
remember? You may say he is gallant because he dared to 
confront someone nobody dares to, but he should not have because 
he is a public figure in an important position. In the past, 
Mr. Shigeru Yoshida threw a cup of water on the face of a 
newspaperman, but he was such an old man that his act was 
dismissed as a joke. 
  [Tahara] You would say it is 10 years too early for him to 
act like that? 
  [Nakasone] So, Mr. Yoshida could be admired, but Mr. Ozawa's 
case could not be praised. Furthermore, he summoned Messrs. 
Miyazawa, Watanabe, and Mitsuzuka to his office for an interview 
prior to deciding on the candidate for the LDP presidency to 
succeed Prime Minister Kaifu. I hope that way of thinking is 
now discarded, but ordinary citizens still suspect that he may 
still have such a subconsciousness which is reflected in the 
management of Shinseito. He is egoistic in abruptly going abroad 
with his family when the Diet comes to an important moment. 
  [Tahara] It could be interpreted as an outburst of youthful 
vitality. 
  [Nakasone] He is, however, a man of crisis, like Messrs. 
Ichiro Nakagawa, Michio Watanabe, Shintaro Ishiwara, and the 
like. 
  [Tahara] They have in common a little tinge of somebody like 
a "yakuza" [hooligan]. 
  [Nakasone] That's right. [laughter] In other words, a man 
without something like forcefulness, decisiveness, swiftness, or 
an intuitive flash of ideas will be good for nothing when 
confronting a crisis. Mr. Ozawa has that ability, and that good 
quality must be valued. 
  [Tahara] That is the point. Mr. Nakasone, you maintained 
the government for five years without harm; what is the knack of 
not being harmed? 
  [Nakasone] For one, you have to be humble, but you do not 
have to be as humble as Mr. Takeshita. [laughter] And you must 
keep a scrupulous watch around you at all times. Mr. Ozawa 
seems to be rather meticulous about this, but he is half-witted 
sometimes. 
<H5>  Japanese Politics Adrift at Sea </H5>
  [Tahara] When the Hosokawa cabinet was desperately trying to 
accomplish political reform, Mr. Nakasone brushed it aside by 
saying, "the current political reform is concerned about small 
politics and is insignificant." What did you mean by that? 
  [Nakasone] The Hosokawa cabinet drafted political reforms to 
be limited to amendments to the law governing elections. The 
most important things are where Japan has to head now that the 
Cold War has ended and the world is at a great turning point? 
For that purpose, what kind of switchover in the basic 
structure of politics should be made and what kinds of policies 
are needed for that? What combination of political parties is 
beneficial for the nation? How can the conglutination between 
the administration and the Diet be remedied? I am talking about 
"zoku-giin" [Diet members lobbying for specific ministries of 
the administration]. And how will the Diet be reformed? These 
questions were left untouched and the reform ended up just 
touching up the election law. 
  In the beginning, the political reforms were intended to 
prevent corruption; this originates from the Kanemaru scandal. 
In other words, the major intent of the reforms was to prevent 
the recurrence of such grave problems. And I am afraid that the 
single-seat constituency election system has the danger of 
escalating such corruption. Further, it incorporates a danger 
of sprouting a legal autocratic system if things go wrong. 
  Such advantages and disadvantages should be presented for 
everyone to see and let the people decide through repeated 
discussion. Things were worked out recklessly without giving 
plenty of time for discussion. I think this surely will fail 
and in the long run it will not necessarily bring happy 
consequences to Japanese politics. 
  [Tahara] The LDP helped the election system reform 
materialize in the end. What do you think about this? 
  [Nakasone] I do not think the LDP should have compromised in 
the first place. 
  In view of the characteristics of a constitutional 
government, the fact that the bill was rejected in the House of 
Councilors should have carried weight. The conference committee 
of both houses should not have been the place to discuss such an 
important issue which is directly related to the fundamentals of 
politics and that was rejected by the House of Councilors. The 
matter should have been dealt with anew, from the start, I think. 
  [Tahara] The bill would have been stillborn if LDP President 
Kono had not extended his helping hand at the top-level talks 
with the ruling parties. 
  [Nakasone] You are right. 
  [Tahara] How do you appraise the LDP as it is now? Did it 
change after becoming an opposition party? 
  [Nakasone] Some within the LDP favored passage of the 
political reform bill, although it is insufficient. Still others 
worried about continuing the same thing for another year, if the 
bill was shelved and the deliberations started all over again. 
Considering these and various other elements, that sort of 
judgment was made, I suppose. Since I and others were not 
handling the matter directly, we followed what the party had 
decided upon. 
  [Tahara] But you think that judgment was incorrect? 
  [Nakasone] History will render such a decision, I suppose. 
  [Tahara] In connection with what you said about such a 
macroanalytic matter as how to deal with Japan's basic 
structure, a number of magazines insist that what we should 
ponder now is the matter of the Japanese Constitution. 
  [Nakasone] Before going in that discussion, I think what is 
important in building the basic structure is what will become of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in the future. And 
this is related to the Constitution. 
  The SDPJ joined the coalition under the condition that the 
major LDP policies would be carried on, without telling the 
people why. This is the No. 1 violation of its public pledge. 
In the ensuing SDPJ response to various policies, it is making 
repeated compromises under the pretext that such compromises 
were inevitable to maintain the regime. It raises the question 
of whether the SDPJ regards its being within the power structure 
as more important than sacrificing what it had publicly promised 
the people and what it had insisted on as its policies. In 
party politics and parliamentary politics, can it so easily 
throw away what it had promised the people during election 
campaigns? Is this not originating from opportunism or from 
authoritarianism? 
  Properly speaking, prior to joining the coalition, the SDPJ 
should have convened a party convention, made certain amendments 
to its policy platform or decided on measures in response to the 
new cabinet, and should have decided on an official change of 
its stance in the name of the convention. Instead, it did so in 
a sneaky manner somewhere, like in the central executive 
committee. It did not matter much or raise a public furor, only 
because the people think the SDPJ policy platform is dead. 
Rather, the people think the changes in the SDPJ are not so 
bad, and this means that the party is no longer supported by the 
people in a sense. 
  [Tahara] The SDPJ has become realistic and reasonable, so 
the people think. 
  [Nakasone] But in a long-range view of constitutional 
government and parliamentary politics, it cannot rid itself of 
the blame that it has sacrificed chastity for power. In the 
House of Councilors, there were SDPJ members centered in its 
leftist faction who opposed the political reform bill, probably 
out of such a view. Or they attempted to defend on the most 
important occasion freedom of judgment and action as members of 
the upper house. It may sound strange, but these leftist 
members staged an independent struggle against control and 
demanded freedom. 
  [Tahara] In a sense, they stuck to their principles. 
  [Nakasone] In that connection, I give them a certain good 
score. 
  The SDPJ is urged to solve that matter at the earliest 
possible date; whether it will or will not split as a party, and 
redefine its policies by convening a party convention. They are 
prerequisites to entering into discussions on the Constitution 
and PKO [peacekeeping operations] problems. 
  [Tahara] You mean you cannot trust those who easily change 
their way of thinking? 
  [Nakasone] It may be so in essence. And this applies to Mr. 
Hosokawa, too. 
  [Tahara] And that kind of a government is at the helm of 
Japan. 
  [Nakasone] That is why the current Japanese politics are 
adrift. As for Mr. Hosokawa, he said he would head for a third 
way and would not become prime minister after the election last 
summer, did he not? 
  [Tahara] He told me so in a talk with me. 
  [Nakasone] Then you are a witness. 
  Despite this, he became prime minister at last. And at a 
post-midnight press conference, he said that the consumption tax 
rate will be raised to 7 percent and it will be renamed the 
national welfare tax, followed by the cancellation of his 
remarks the next day. 
  He publicly stated before the people concerned and the 
press that he would carry out a cabinet reshuffle, but gave up 
very easily. He is good at brushing aside his remarks. It may 
be a kind of opportunism necessary to maintain his regime and 
enforce his policies to a certain degree. 
  [Tahara] In that connection, Mr. Hosokawa and the SDPJ have 
something in common. 
  [Nakasone] However, Mr. Hosokawa is attempting, in the name 
of his cabinet, to realize higher objectives and the people seem 
to be generous towards him. 
  [Tahara] Is the SDPJ deviating from permissible limits? 
  [Nakasone] That is right. In view of its history, it cannot 
change its weighty public pledges so easily. 
  [Tahara] You mean that the SDPJ should have acted more 
intelligently during the Nakasone cabinet days, if the SDPJ were 
so intelligent in the first place? 
  [Nakasone] You are right. [laughter] 
<H5>  Absence of Crisis Control System </H5>
  [Tahara] If you think that you do not feel like discussing 
important matters in sincere manner with the coalition 
government in which the SDPJ participates, is wrecking the 
government not the only thing you can do? 
  [Nakasone] What is more grave is that the present government 
has no crisis control system in its basic structure. 
  [Tahara] What do you mean by that? 
  [Nakasone] It is demanding that bureaucrats be in charge of 
crisis control, but it has nothing like that in its political 
base. 
  One example is problems related to the DPRK. I doubt whether 
Japan can immediately respond with measures that can satisfy the 
international community, if and when the United Nations adopts a 
resolution to that effect. You remember, Japan could not win 
respect from anywhere because it was late in responding even 
though it contributed $13 billion later. As long as the present 
government keeps its perverted condition in its basic structure, 
there is no guarantee of not repeating the same fiasco. In other 
words, it is a grave national defect that the cabinet does not 
firmly establish a crisis control system in its base. If this 
situation is allowed to go on, Japan will be ruined for sure in 
two years. 
  Such perversity exists between the prime minister and the 
chief cabinet secretary. It is the extremity of disorder in 
public authority that a vice minister discusses important 
taxation matters with a party leader, without the chief cabinet 
secretary. As such, no other ministries will follow the 
leadership. 
  [Tahara] That is an important subject, about which I will 
ask you later. Now I would like to focus our talk on the DPRK 
problem. What is your opinion? 
  [Nakasone] It is a serious problem. In my opinion, it will 
become a problem that will give the whole Japanese people an 
opportunity to reconsider Japanese security and what Japan 
should do in the international community. 
  [Tahara] That is the point. The Japanese people have a 
strong tendency to think that it is a problem between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and DPRK or between 
the United States and DPRK, and Japan has little to do with it. 
  [Nakasone] Exactly. And that is a big mistake. First, as I 
said before, what will Japan's response be if the United Nations 
adopts a resolution of sanctions and the like? It would have an 
immediate impact on domestic affairs. And there is a 
possibility that it would touch on constitutional matters. 
  Another problem is how Japan would respond cleverly so it 
would not lose its value in the international community. If 
this problem is taken too lightly and overlooked and the DPRK 
succeeds in getting way with it, many other countries would 
follow suit. You cannot be sure that countries in the Middle 
East and its vicinity are not alert for every possible chance to 
produce nuclear weapons. 
  [Tahara] You used the expression "getting away with it"; do 
you mean by that to succeed in the development of nuclear 
weapons? 
  [Nakasone] I meant that the matter is overlooked with 
ambiguity. By that, the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] 
would be rendered almost ineffective and would collapse. It 
will pose a hindrance to the problem of extending the NPT, due 
to be considered next year. Stern attitudes are required not to 
collapse the NPT. 
  I do not think the DPRK desires a decisive rupture like war. 
It should know that war will lead that country to ruin. 
However, in the international community, where it is cornered, 
the DPRK wanted to demonstrate to the world that it is dealing 
with the United States on equal terms, disregarding both the ROK 
and Japan. Thus, it is playing a poker game with the United 
States, with nuclear weapons as the hostage. It wants to gain 
as much time as possible and will give out minute compromises to 
evade a decisive catastrophe. For us, it is important to let 
them put more weight on settlement through dialogue and evade 
the catastrophe as much as possible. 
  In that sense, the DPRK is succeeding. On the other hand, 
the United States is no ordinary negotiator in that it is 
dealing with the matter with a strong intention to lead the 
dialogue to settlement, knowing it is a poker game. Japan, for 
its part, must get along with the poker game by providing the 
United Nations Security Council with wisdom or talking with the 
United States strenuously, with full knowledge of the DPRK or 
PRC position. 
  As for the United States, it cannot make easy compromises 
as the whole world watches before the NPT's extention. When the 
United Nations adopts a resolution as a last resort, Japan 
should wholeheartedly support it and do whatever it can. And I 
think the matter should be dealt with by such a basic attitude. 
  [Tahara] You said Japan should take a stern attitude, 
precisely what do you mean by that? 
  [Nakasone] Production or possession of nuclear weapons will 
not be allowed. Withdrawal from the NPT will not be permitted. 
Allow the IAEA to inspect nuclear facilities. Japan should take 
a stern attitude to uphold such policies. 
  [Tahara] I do not know how to put it in words. Imagine that 
economic sanctions took place. It is suspected that quite an 
amount of money is remitted by North Koreans in Japan to the 
DPRK and it will have far-reaching effects if Japan stops the 
flow. If an economic blockade is enforced, the Maritime 
Self-Defense Force has to dispatch its fleet to the Sea of 
Japan. These kinds of problems will come up. 
  [Nakasone] The Security Council will issue unofficial 
warnings. Then they are followed by gradual sanctions, probably 
in three steps. For example, warnings will be issued to stop 
human exchanges or to stop landings of aircraft in the 
beginning. It is necessary to see how the other side responds 
to this. 
  Prior to this, the government has to work out proper 
measures 
at this stage, in preparation for the worst. For example, North 
Korean ships cannot be denied entry into Japanese ports because 
of the treaties signed in the Ansei period [1854-1859]. A new 
law is required to do otherwise. In addition, there are 
problems related to trade, foreign exchange, and management of 
remittances. Dealing with such problems early will also serve 
as a warning to the DPRK. 
  From such loose measures to severe actions in an emergency, 
Japan has to discuss such a multistage diplomatic strategy with 
the United States and the ROK, while at the same time carrying 
on preparations for both domestic and external measures in order 
to be prepared for the worst. And this is the task of the 
cabinet. 
  [Tahara] If a second Korean war breaks out, in the worst 
case, how is Japan going to cooperate, regardless of becoming 
either a member of UN forces or multinational forces? I am 
afraid that the case of the Gulf war will be repeated unless 
these matters are considered and properly dealt with. 
  [Nakasone] Since that matter is a delicate problem, I would 
rather not comment now. It may unnecessarily get on North 
Korea's nerves, and it is related to the constitutional problems. 
  At any rate, a solution is being sought through diplomatic 
negotiations at this stage and we politicians must make remarks 
praying for the success of such negotiations. What you 
mentioned are things to be commented on when the situation comes 
to a certain stage. Diplomatic negotiations and military 
actions are completely different matters. 
  [Tahara] You mean that thoughtless remarks on military 
actions should not be made? 
  [Nakasone] Yes, at least at the present stage. They are 
engaged in a poker game, not a war game. 
  The politician's task is to attain objectives with patience. 
Although the DPRK is a difficult country to deal with, its 
neighboring countries must display a certain amount of 
consideration. It is also necessary to show, where proper, that 
the Japanese people have such consideration for the DPRK. 
<H5>  Political Organization of APEC Urged </H5>
  [Tahara] By the way, Mr. Nakasone, you were for amendments 
to the Constitution before becoming prime minister. After 
becoming prime minister, you refrained from referring to that 
matter. What is your opinion now? 
  [Nakasone] When I was in charge of the cabinet, there were 
piles of problems before us, such as diplomacy toward the United 
States and the ROK and administrative reform. Therefore, I said 
I would not put constitutional amendments on the political 
agenda. I have consistently insisted, however, that it is 
necessary to examine the Constitution. 
  There were fundamental defects in the Constitution when it 
was formulated. At the Cabinet Commission on the Constitution, 
Chairman Takayanagi said "it was a joint work of Japan and the 
United States, but we resisted by saying that `it is a 
nonindependent constitution formulated under U.S. leadership 
with Japanese cooperation.'" At the time of its formulation, at 
least over 6 million Japanese had not been repatriated from 
China or Siberia. In addition, several hundreds of thousand 
people could not act because they were purged from public 
office. That Constitution was formulated under such completely 
nonfunctioning conditions. Properly speaking, a new constitution 
should have been formulated when everybody abroad was 
repatriated. But it was neglected, due in part to leftist 
pressure. Mr. Shigeru Yoshida took advantage of such a 
situation in a veiled attempt to push through his policy 
priority on the economy. When I formed my cabinet, I mentioned 
"the final settlement of postwar political accounts," and I was 
referring to getting rid of such Yoshida-style politics. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Ichiro Ozawa wrote in his book Nippon 
Kaizo Keikaku [Blueprint for Building a New 
Japan] that Mr. Yoshida's choice was good at that time, but 
now it has to be amended. But Mr. Nakasone, you are more severe 
about it. 
  [Nakasone] You are right. At present, the United Nations 
has great power. Properly speaking, the matter should have been 
settled when Japan joined the United Nations. Now this problem 
must be presented before the people; the link between Article 9 
of the Constitution and cooperation with the United Nations must 
be reexamined to get a consensus. 
  [Tahara] I will ask you a straight question. Do you mean 
that the Constitution should be amended and that Japan should 
cooperate militarily when a situation like the Gulf war breaks 
out, and that this reflects what Japan should be? 
  [Nakasone] It depends on the meaning of the word 
"militarily." Japan will have to cooperate with UN forces or 
with military actions taken at the initiative of the United 
Nations. But it must be limited to such fields as 
transportation, communications, medical treatment, construction, 
and the like. Self-Defense Forces will not be dispatched for 
the purpose of using armed force. 
  [Tahara] Is it not possible as UN forces? 
  [Nakasone] It should not be done before the Constitution is 
amended. 
  [Tahara] When the time comes when the people are asked what 
they think, what kind of view will you present for the people to 
see, Mr. Nakasone? 
  [Nakasone] It is difficult to say at this time. But you 
cannot deny the possibility of participating in acts of 
hostilities in accordance with the mutual security treaty [with 
the United States], in such inevitable situations as Japan being 
invaded and its security in peril, or Japan being on the verge 
of ruin due to an oil supply cut off. But it may be wise to 
have a certain safeguard to restrain, to the best of Japan's 
power, such acts from taking place as acts of the government, 
while the constitutional possibility to undertake such acts are 
acknowledged. For instance, make the consent of the Diet 
necessary. 
  [Tahara] Now let us talk about the Mutual Security Treaty 
between Japan and the United States, which is different from the 
constitutional discussion. Now that the Cold War structure has 
collapsed, what do you think about the Japan-U.S. Mutual 
Security Treaty? 
  [Nakasone] The Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty has 
undergone some changes in its character, and due to these 
changes I think it is functioning extremely well. 
  [Tahara] Is that so? 
  [Nakasone] What I mean is that the presence of U.S. Forces 
from the Aleutian Islands to the Persian Gulf plays an extremely 
vital role in deterring conflicts from occurring. Asian nations 
welcome it. In this connection, I think the Mutual Security 
Treaty, with important bases in Yokosuka and Okinawa, is 
functioning as a potential deterrentforce in the prevention of 
international conflicts. 
  In that sense, the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty has 
become a kind of political alliance beyond one that focuses on 
the defense of Japan. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is 
similar in that it is a military alliance and at the same time a 
political alliance. I think it necessary to respect and 
maintain such functions to the full extent. 
  [Tahara] To maintain the security of such a wide region from 
the Aleutians to the Gulf, it is conceivable that Asian nations 
and the ROK or Indonesia, not only Japan and the United States, 
will be included as in the case of NATO, is it not? 
  [Nakasone] I am not considering it. This is because there 
are constitutional problems: Such problems as individual 
self-defense rights or collective self-defense rights are not 
defined as yet. I think we have the right to collective 
self-defense under the present Constitution. But the government 
is keeping it under control and a popular consensus has not yet 
been obtained. 
  I want to say loud and clear that I want to set up a 
political framework to discuss peace and security or to bring 
about trust in the Asia-Pacific region. What I have in mind is 
to set up an organization to talk about international security 
or such a political framework as the CSCE and let world leaders 
get together maybe twice a year and talk over the state of 
military affairs, control of military expenses, measures to 
bring about mutual trust, and prevention of arms transfer and of 
conflicts. I wish to make the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty 
a double structure backed up by such a political framework. 
  [Tahara] You envision the United States in that setup. 
  [Nakasone] Yes. 
  [Tahara] Is it something like a political version of APEC 
[Asia Pacific Economic Conference]? 
  [Nakasone] Yes. I think it is indispensable to maintaining 
the Japan-U.S. Mutual Security Treaty. 
<H5>  Sole Reliance on Bureaucrats Would Not Do </H5>
  [Tahara] With respect to the United States, the counterpart 
in the Mutual Security Treaty, the common adversary has 
disappeared and its relationship with Japan has begun to be 
jerky. What is your view of the recent talks Hosokawa had with 
Clinton? 
  [Nakasone] It is still too early to call it a failure, but 
it certainly is not a success. Both sides have made mistakes. 
  [Tahara] What were they? 
  [Nakasone] On the U.S. side, there was a Glen Fukushima 
paper. Parts Clinton was said to underline read, "Japanese 
bureaucrats are exclusively for the status quo. It will result 
in a big mistake to accept the suggestions of such bureaucrats." 
It added, "Japan has never honored its promises. It has not 
put into practice the agreement reached between Miyazawa and 
Bush two years ago." "It will do no good to repeat the same 
thing in dealing with such a unique country" "Let it set up 
precise numerical targets." The paper read something like that. 
  This paper had a big impact. The Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative followed the parts underlined by Clinton as they 
had been advised. 
  Clinton handed that paper to such government economic 
officials as Bentsen, Kantor, or Cutter, but the State 
Department did not seem to get it. In the past, leading State 
Department authorities like Shultz, Baker, and so on handled 
negotiations between Japan and the United States, but now 
economic officials with the background of lobbyists or lawyers 
are in charge of negotiations. These people, with less 
diplomatic experience, have confronted Japanese bureaucrats of 
the Finance and Foreign Ministries. Thus their talks ended in 
rupture. Such excuses as "relations between adults" or 
"excluding ambiguous agreements glossing over the problems of 
the times" were used to cover up the failure, but the aim of 
diplomacy is to lead the negotiations to an agreement, and that 
is what adults are to do--parting after quarrels is what 
children do. 
  [Tahara] What were Japan's mistakes? 
  [Nakasone] When the Bush-Miyazawa talks threatened to break 
up two years ago like it did this time, the administrative vice 
minister for foreign affairs, Owada, sat up all night 
negotiating an agreement with the United States. 
  [Tahara] A consultative organization was set up as a result. 
  [Nakasone] When it realized in detail how the crisis had 
reached a boiling point, the new regime should have immediately 
started to work out the problem, but it did not and entrusted 
the whole work to bureaucrats. Those bureaucrats had to protect 
the interests of their own ministries, and no progress was made 
in their negotiations. And Glen Fukushima's paper added fuel to 
the fire. In other words, no diplomacy existed. 
  [Tahara] You mean that the negotiations were carried out 
between bureaucrats, and political diplomacy had no part in it? 
  [Nakasone] Yes. And the primary responsibility rests on the 
foreign minister rather than Mr. Hosokawa. 
  [Tahara] Many think that agreements are worked out by 
bureaucrats beforehand and the prime minister and foreign 
minister go to Washington only to shake hands. Is it not so? 
  [Nakasone] At least, not in my case. When the Japan-U.S. 
cooperation on military technology was worked out in 1983, I 
persuaded the director general of the cabinet legislative bureau 
to reach an agreement, although the bureau itself had insisted 
that it was absolutely impossible. And between Reagan and I 
were MOSS [market-oriented sector-selective] negotiations which 
resulted in market opening in the telecommunications field. At 
that time, I gave instructions to the then administrative vice 
minister of posts and telecommunications, Koyama, and dispatched 
him to Washington three times. There had never been such 
precedents as dispatching vice ministers abroad for negotiations 
-- and on three occasions! From the stage of prior 
consultations, the prime minister or the foreign minister must 
instruct bureaucrats what to do, not letting them do the work by 
themselves. Without doing this, the prime minister went to 
Washington without giving too much thought to the matter, 
relying solely on the worksheet written by bureaucrats. 
  The same thing can be said about the Uruguay Round. When the 
chief cabinet secretary made the final draft public, he did not 
refer to the sixth item that "after six years, tariffication 
will be abolished and additional commitments have to be taken by 
Japan." 
  [Tahara] Mr. Takemura said he "had not heard about that 
part." 
  [Nakasone] It revealed that the prime minister or the chief 
cabinet secretary had not given instructions of "their ideas" to 
the bureaucrats, the foreign minister, or minister of 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, but that the chief cabinet 
secretary merely read what the bureaucrats in Geneva had 
decided. If they had committed themselves from the beginning, 
this sort of important thing could not be forgotten. As you see 
from what I mentioned so far, the present politics are solely 
dependent on what the bureaucrats suggest. I think this is a 
dangerous practice. 
  There is no denying that Japanese politics were carried out 
dependent on bureaucrats. In the case of the LDP, however, 
there were fastidious members in various divisions and prime 
ministers, to have their ideas reflected in policies, made good 
use of them. In that sense, the Office of the Prime Minister and 
Foreign Ministry bureaucrats were working together as a unit. 
Now the unity is completely torn to pieces. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Hosokawa said in his press conference after the 
collapse of the Japan-U.S. summit "from now on, say frankly what 
we can and what we cannot compromise on." How about this point? 
  [Nakasone] It is a foolish remark. If you say "No" to the 
United States, it was said earlier by Mr. Shintaro Ishihara. If 
letting talks collapse is relations between adults, are they who 
make talk successful children? 
  [Tahara] That means Mr. Nakasone was a child. [laughter] 
  [Nakasone] That is nothing but an excuse. Yosuke Matsuoka 
was welcomed home by nationwide applause after having made Japan 
withdraw from the League of Nations. And that action later led 
Japan into World War II. It looks like the same thing is 
happening again. Generally speaking, nationwide applause or 
national frenzy tend to hurt the nation. Examples are Hitler of 
Germany and the Cultural Revolution in China. 
  [Tahara] You mean the high popularity of Mr. Hosokawa is 
somewhat dangerous in a certain sense? 
  [Nakasone] It is all right to have high popularity, but I 
mean that he should not become elated. 
<H5>  Qualifications of a Prime Minister </H5>
  [Tahara] Incidentally, I would like to hear from a man who 
served in the premiership for five long years what the important 
qualifications of a prime minister are. 
  [Nakasone] It varies according to time and country. I 
think three qualifications are required for a Japanese prime 
minister today. One is the ability of eye measurement, an 
ability to handle and solve problems, in other words, an 
intuitive ability of conjecture. The second is an ability to 
unite talented persons, wisdom, and clean money. And the third 
is persuasive power, to persuade foreign countries as well as 
his own people. [passage omitted on evaluation of past prime 
ministers] 
  [Tahara] The LDP, a professional group led by such 
successive party presidents, is now an opposition party. The 
ruling coalition government has an amateur as its head and 
embraces a dangerous entity, the SDPJ, within its fold. What do 
you think the LDP should do under these conditions? 
  [Nakasone] The important things are how to make the basic 
structure of Japanese politics stable in a medium-to-long range 
prospect, rather than how to attack the ruling parties and 
recapture the helm of government. The present coalition 
government has some twisting elements in it and disproportionate 
phenomena, something like detached farmlands. Real political 
realignment can be possible by touching them up. Our utmost 
task is to remedy as soon as possible the present 
disproportionate and cloudy situation which take so much time in 
reaching decisions. Foreign countries trust a government that 
is predictable. Right now, it is in a fog. 
  The other day, I told an LDP Diet member that the present 
LDP 
has no "navel," like a frog. It has to make a "navel." Without 
it, the LDP has no driving power. 
  [Tahara] I take it that "navel" means "hatajirushi" or 
policy objectives. What objectives should the LDP have? 
  [Nakasone] Policywise, a neoconservative liberalism. It 
means a small government, an open-door policy internationally, 
and daring deregulation that will let free economic activities 
demonstrate dynamism to the maximum. It is to learn many 
lessons from history and tradition, respect self-responsibility 
and treasure one's home, and stop wasting money for welfare for 
no definite purpose. Those who work hard will be rewarded. 
Those are the principles. 
  [Tahara] They seem to be close to the lines of the U.S. 
Republican Party. Mr. Hosokawa, if anything, is close to the 
Democratic Party of the United States. 
  [Nakasone] Since we live in a time of fertility, I think it 
is our task to let individuals display their dynamism under free 
competition. In this connection, there may be a need to 
reexamine the bureaucratic system. The number of ministries 
would be reduced to about 10. Employment of high-echelon public 
servants and redistribution of personnel would no longer be 
handled by each ministry or agency, but by the cabinet. A free 
appointment system would be introduced to certain high-level 
ranks. Once done, the present Japanese bureaucracy would change. 
  [Tahara] What do you think about the long-advocated 
public election of the prime minister? 
  [Nakasone] By and by it is becoming realistic. Now that the 
duel between liberalism and socialism has ended, such 
confrontation seen in a free society like the Republican and 
Democratic Parties in the United States emerges at this time. 
As the sentiment grows that the current parliamentary cabinet 
system, which has been subjected to great stress, has to be 
replaced, the choice between public election of the prime 
minister or the parliamentary cabinet system will be strongly 
demanded. In the LDP, Mr. Taku Yamazaki and others are 
sponsoring a study group on public election of the prime 
minister, and many in the SDPJ are in favor of such a move. 
  [Tahara] What is the biggest defect in the present method of 
choosing a prime minister? 
  [Nakasone] Because the prime minister is not chosen by a 
direct mandate from the people, the authority of the executive 
power is weak and tends to be short-lived. A major reason why 
my cabinet could carry out powerful policies was that I became 
prime minister after mustering 50,000 to 60,000 votes in an 
earlier preliminary election. Yeltsin could wield power for the 
first time after having been elected president in a public 
election. I think that the Japanese prime minister should 
follow this example. The emperor is the symbol of the unity of 
the people in accordance with traditional authority and the 
prime minister will be the functional political unity under the 
emperor. 
  Thre is one more thing I would like to add that is 
politically important and that is to reflect on the 20th century 
with the 21st century at the threshold. I propose to establish 
a censuring committee on the 20th century, because it was the 
gloomiest period in the history of mankind. 
  Two world wars, financial crises, a 70-year confrontation 
between communism and freedom, the menace of nuclear weapons and 
so on. No other century witnessed so many miserable deaths of 
human beings through wars and purges than the 20th century. Of 
course, there were such encouraging factors as the denouncement 
of colonialism, the birth of so many independent nations, 
advances in scientific technology and medicine, Olympic Games, 
and Nobel Prizes. Taking all these pluses and minuses into 
account, there has never been such a miserable century as the 
20th. 
  [Tahara] It was the worst century of all? 
  [Nakasone] There is a need for those who have lived in that 
century to analyze and pass judgment on the 20th century during 
a transitional period toward the 21st century and appeal to the 
world that the same course not be repeated in the coming 
century. How about each political party setting up such a 
committee and make public that voice from Japan. 
  I think it would be better for Japan to initiate such a 
large-scale civilized idea.

  [Text] The Council of Economic Ministers has asked the Bank 
of Thailand and the National Economic and Social Development 
Board (NESDB) to revise their figures for this year, including 
the inflation rate, Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said 
yesterday. 
  Mr Tharin said the revision was necessary because of higher 
exports and stronger growth, which will cause inflationary 
pressures. 
  "We want the two agencies to control inflation within the 
earlier target of 4.2-4.5 percent, because if it accelerates 
beyond that, the general public will be affected," he said. 
  High food prices have contributed much to higher inflation. 
Prices of agricultural commodities including vegetables have 
gone up, particularly in the provinces, affecting the living 
standards of rural people. 
  Higher consumption of electricity in the first quarter (up 
18.2 percent on the figure for the same period last year) could 
also cause oil prices to rise, which is why the two agencies 
must study how to control the factors which contribute to 
inflation, he said. 
  The two agencies yesterday presented to the Cabinet an 
assessment of the economic situation in the first quarter of 
this year when inflation was as high as 4.8 percent. The 
inflation problem needs to be tackled urgently, Mr Tharin said. 
  The Cabinet asked both agencies to revise the growth rate 
based on three major factors: improving exports, government 
spending and investment in the provinces, and private investment 
particularly outside Bangkok. 
  The two agencies have one month for the revision, which will 
then be submitted to the Cabinet for further consideration. 
  Meanwhile, Roengchai Marakanon, deputy governor of the Bank 
of Thailand, said Thailand's inflation was tending to decline 
since credit growth is being sustained, thanks to the likely 
interest rate rises. 
  Annual inflation is expected to average the projected 4.8 
percent and will not exceed this level, he said. 
  In the past month, exports rose to 16 percent, against the 
projected 14.8 percent, while imports stood at only 10 percent. 
The country's foreign trade for the month was also 
satisfactory, he said. 
  Dr Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank, 
shared 
Mr Roengchai's view, saying rising interest rates would result 
in a sustained inflation rate in the long run. 
  Dr Olan added that the country's inflation this year stemmed 
from rising food and petrol prices. If these two categories of 
goods are not taken into account, the country's inflation rate 
would not surpass 4 percent. 
  Moreover, when comparing the projected annual inflation rate 
of 4.8 percent with the country's projected 8 percent growth, 
the overall economy is not unsatisfactory, he noted. 
  "Inflation in countries like Italy and France is growing 
faster than that of Thailand. In those nations, the inflation 
rate is as high as 4.5 percent while the economy grows at only 2 
percent," Dr Olan said. 
  "Thailand is likely to be subject to high inflation only in 
the case of high global inflation." 
  As for credit growth, which is usually viewed as a catalyst 
for inflation, he said that in commercial banking, it stood at 
only 15- 16 percent. It has not yet exceeded the alarming 20 
percent level, he said. 
  Nevertheless, when taking into account loans extended 
through 
the Bangkok international banking facilities (BIBFs), the figure 
may jump beyond 23 percent. 
  Dr Olan concluded that he believed that this year, the Thai 
economy would expand steadily in a stable fashion. At present, 
Thailand almost tops the global list in the proportional-usage 
of gross domestic product (GDP) in investment. 
  About 60 percent of Thailand's GDP is consumed locally, 
while 
40 percent is used in investment. Korea uses 30 percent of its 
GDP for investment, he said. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak said Thailand 
would try to maintain export growth this year at the high level 
of 22 percent through various means, including expanding the 
country's competitiveness in international markets. 
  Dr Suphachai said Thailand's export growth rate in the first 
quarter was up 21-22 percent on the figure for the same period 
last year, against a target of only 15 percent.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 21 -- A symposium on investment and 
business in Vietnam was held in Washington (USA) on May 19-20 in 
the presence of a Vietnamese delegation led by Deputy Prime 
Minister Tran Duc Luong who arrived in the US on May 18. 
  Mr. Luong was accompanied by the cabinet minister in charge 
of cooperation and investment, and some vice ministers in charge 
of economic branches and businessmen. 
  During the symposium which was sponsored by the `World 
Economic Development Congress' organization, Ms V. Foot, 
president of the US-Vietnam Commerce Council delivered an 
introdution on Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong's biography. 
  Speaking at the symposium, Mr luong briefed the economic 
achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in recent years. 
He noted that Vietnam's sound external policy in recent years 
has made important contributions to the renovation cause and 
economic achievements in Vietnam, at the same time integrated 
Vietnam into the international community. He also said that 
Vietnam was ready to join ASEAN as full member, welcomed the 
development of the relationship with APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation], prepared for its accession to WTO (GATT) and 
broadened its economic ties with the European Union. 
  On the US-Vietnam relations, he said, the two sides agreed 
in 
principles to settle technical issues relating to the exchanges 
of representative offices with regulations of general consulate. 
He reinterated that the Vietnamese Government and people 
expresssed their sympathies over the issue of Americans missing 
in action (MIA) and would continue their efforts to settle this 
humanitarian issue. 
  During his stay in Washington, Deputy Prime Minister Tran 
Duc 
Luong met with Secretary of State W. Christopher and Senators J. 
Kerry, J. McCain and B. Johnston. 
  Mr. Luong also called on the headquarters of World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund in Washington.

  [Text] A high-level source in the multiethnic army of Chang 
Sifu or "Khun Sa" denied a report on the recapture of several 
towns on the western bank of the Salween River by Rangoon 
government troops. 
  The source confirmed that Khun Sa's soldiers are still in 
full control of all strongholds, noting that the report on the 
recapture of towns from Khun Sa's army was merely propaganda 
from the Burmese Government. He admitted that goverment troops 
are present in the region, but they have not yet launched any 
offensive against Khun Sa's positions. 
  Both the government's side and Khun Sa's army suffered heavy 
casualties in the fighting, which broke out opposite Lak Taeng 
village of Wiang Haeng District, Chiang Mai Province, since 7 
May. It was reported that the Burmese Government has recaptured 
eight strongholds earlier taken over by Khun Sa's men. On 20 
May, some 7,000 government soldiers, together with 1,200 
porters, were reportedly rallying in the vicinities of Mong Chot 
and Mong Tuan in preparation for crossing the Salween River to 
the western bank to launch attacks on Khun Sa's positions. 
  The source said he was unaware of the report on the U.S. 
financial assistance given to the Burmese Government for the 
suppression operations against ethnic rebel groups, adding that 
the Burmese Government probably cited narcotics problem as a 
pretext to request the U.S. help. 
  Our correspondent reported that although the fighting was 18 
kilometers away, the sound of artillery shelling could be 
clearly heard in Wiang Haeng district town. No wounded soldiers 
from Khun Sa's army crossed the border to seek treatment from 
Wiang Haeng district's hospital as in the past because Khun Sa 
has set up field hospitals at the strongholds captured earlier 
from the government side. 
  District Clerk Phongsakon Thirabadi said he had instructed 
officials to closely monitor the situation along the border with 
Burma. However, he anticipated gruesome battles if the 
government troops are able to cross the Salween River to the 
western side, and this can trigger refugee influx into Thailand.

  [Text] China intends to purchase more goods from Malaysia, 
especially commodities such as processed palm oil and crude 
petroleum as well as food products. China's State Planning 
Commission Vice Chairman, Encik [Mr.] Gan Ziyu said China would 
like to improve its imports from Malaysia because the momentum 
for the economic growth of 9 percent in China is still high. He 
told newsmen this after calling on Deputy Minister of 
International Trade and Industry, Encik Chua Jui Meng in Kuala 
Lumpur. 
  China is also interested to import the commodities and food 
products through more direct trade with Malaysia. At the same 
time, it plans to improve its exports of edible oils, textile 
machinery, and fabrics to Malaysia. 
  Gan said China's exports to Malaysia in 1993 increased by 21 
percent over the previous year while at the same time its 
imports rose by 30 percent. Bilateral trade between Malaysia 
and China grew by 500 percent between 1985 and 1993. Malaysia's 
exports of commodities such as processed palm oil, crude 
petroleum, natural rubber and cacao made up 78 percent of total 
exports to China.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is poised to 
inform the United States of its position that it is firmly 
opposed to North Korea's proposal for replacing the Korean 
armistice agreement with a peace treaty being discussed in 
U.S.-North Korea talks, according to Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku Monday. 
  Yi told the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National 
Unification Committee the government will convey such position 
at Seoul-Washington working-level meetings to be held in the 
U.S. capital soon in preparation for a third round of high-level 
talks between the United States and North Korea. 
  Yi said, "substituting the armistice agreement with a peace 
accord cannot be an issue to be discussed between the United 
States and North Korea, and this point will be reiterated to the 
U.S. Government by Nuclear Affairs Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, who 
is currently visiting Washington." 
  Yi, also the national unification minister, made the remarks 
while replying to lawmakers' questions on the possibility that 
North Korea may demand a peace accord. 
  The South Korean Government has devised its policy based on 
an analysis of North Korea's strategy in demanding a U.S. troop 
withdrawal from Korea. 
  Government officials said the issue of a peace accord should 
be addressed by the South and North Koreans in accordance with 
the basic South-North agreement signed in 1992. Until that 
time, the present armistice accord should be strictly observed, 
they stressed.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The United States, 
looking to hold a third round of negotiations with North Korea 
in early June, held a working-level contact in New York Monday 
afternoon to prepare for the proposed talks. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean ambassador in charge of nuclear 
affairs, Kim Sam-hun, met with Robert Gallucci, chairman of the 
Clinton Administration Policy Group on Korea, to coordinate 
their countries' positions on the next round of 
Washington-Pyongyang high-level talks. 
  In New York, the U.S. side was said to have proposed a date 
for the negotiations after reiterating its conditions for the 
talks. 
  Depending on North Korea's attitude, there is a strong 
possibility the talks could be held in early June, sources said. 
  State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry confirmed that an 
unofficial contact with North Korea had taken place in New York. 
McCurry also said that Gallucci, in addition to his meeting 
with Kim Sam-hun, is expected to hold several days of talks with 
officials from Japan and China on the North Korean nuclear 
dispute in New York beginning Tuesday. 
  Speaking at a regular weekly press briefing, McCurry said 
that if North Korea could agree with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) on the question of maintaining nuclear 
safeguards, there would be no obstacle to the third round of 
talks. 
  "The IAEA's ability to conduct the activities it needs to 
maintain safeguards on spent fuel -- as long as that is 
preserved, we would see no obstacle to another round of 
high-level talks," McCurry said. 
  The spokesman called on Pyongyang to accommodate the 
activities of the IAEA inspection team as soon as possible. 
  "We certainly urge North Korea to agree to the procedures 
the 
IAEA needs as soon as possible and not to jeopardize the IAEA's 
ability to conduct activities necessary to maintain safeguards 
on the spent fuel," he said. 
  The United States has not decided on the date for the third 
round of talks, McCurry said. 
  "We wouldn't proceed to announcing a date without a full 
range of consultations with others that we share an interest in 
this subject with," he added. "That would include the Government 
of Japan and obviously South Korea." 
  But one senior State Department official said further talks 
with Pyongyang could be held early next month, when the two 
countries are expected to discuss the nuclear issue as well as 
problems related to normalizing political and trade relations. 
  Following his meeting with Gallucci, South Korean Ambassador 
Kim hinted that the conditions for third-round talks between 
Washington and Pyongyang have pratically been satisfied. 
Specifically, Kim said the principal condition for the talks is 
additional IAEA inspection of a key radiochemical laboratory and 
servicing of surveillance equipment. 
  As for the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, 
Kim said that if North Korea continued to remove spent fuel 
rods, the basis for dialogue could "collapse." But discussions 
on the refueling between the IAEA and Pyongyang can proceed in 
parallel with the U.S.-North Korea talks if measurement of the 
spent fuel rods by the IAEA later is guaranteed, Kim said. 
  McCurry said that should the discharge of fuel from the 
5-megawatt reactor continue without any of the IAEA's proposed 
steps being in place, then North Korea would inevitably 
undermine the basis for dialogue. 
  "We'd have no choice but to return the matter to the United 
Nations Security Council," he said.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Kim Sam-hun, South 
Korea's nuclear ambassador who is currently visiting the United 
States, said Monday the North Korean nuclear fuel rod problem is 
one basis of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks but not a 
precondition to the dialogue. 
  Kim made the remark after meeting with Robert Gallucci, U.S. 
assistant secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs, 
to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and 
Pyongyang-Washington talks for about four and a half hours at 
the State Department. 
  He indicated that conditions for U.S.-North Korea high-level 
talks have virtually been met, saying, "The direct conditions 
for the talks are additional inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the radiochemical laboratory and 
follow-up inspections on maintenance of the IAEA's monitoring 
equipment. 
  "As far as I know, the IAEA's additional inspection has been 
carried out smoothly." 
  He noted that solving the fuel rod problem at the 5-megawatt 
reactor in Yongbyon is not a precondition to the third round of 
dialogue but a basis on which Pyongyang and Washington can 
continue bilateral talks. 
  "The basis can be prepared only when North Korea stops 
replacing the fuel rods or accepts the IAEA position, which 
demands selection, storage and measurement of the fuel, or 
agrees with the IAEA to secure measurement in any form after a 
certain period. 
  "If North Korea pushes to withdraw fuel rods from the 
reactor 
unilaterally, the basis of the talks is feared to collapse at a 
certain point in time," he said. 
  IAEA officials have already confirmed that Pyongyang 
replaced 
some fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor without outside 
supervision, while another IAEA team is to arrive in Pyongyang 
on Tuesday to negotiate supervision of further refueling. 
  He also hinted that the IAEA-North Korean negotiations on 
fuel rods and the Pyongyang-Washington talks could be carried 
out side by side. 
  Kim's comments suggest that the United States will push for 
a 
third round of high-level talks unless the IAEA officially 
announces that North Korea's fuel rod replacement has already 
passed over the "red line," even if the fuel rod negotiations 
take much time. He added that it is up to the IAEA to determine 
the "red line" up to which measurement of the fuel rods is 
secured.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] team 
for negotiations with North Korea that arrived in Pyongyang this 
afternoon will work for the replacement of nuclear fuel rods, 
along with the three inspectors who have checked the replacement 
of nuclear fuel rods in North Korea for the past week. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that the IAEA negotiating 
team 
arrived in Pyongyang this afternoon and will begin full-pledged 
negotiations with North Korean officials tomorrow. 
  In particular, it is expected that, in the forthcoming 
negotiations with North Korea, the IAEA will demand [chokku] a 
random choice [imui sontaek] of replaced nuclear fuel rods and 
separate preservation [pyolto pogwan] of them in special 
containers, and North Korea will repeatedly insist on its 
previous position that it will allow this after the nuclear 
issue is resolved in a package deal through negotiations with 
the United States.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Science and Technology 
Minister Kim Si-chung doubts whether North Korea's Science and 
Technology are so developed as to be used for making nuclear 
bombs and other weapons. In an interview with a science journal, 
Kim said, "If we are to extract plutonium, care should be taken 
to treat (spent nuclear fuel) in such a safe way that allows no 
difference in mass after having it reprocessed." 
  "Reprocessing is possible, but we would require enormous 
time 
and technology in the process of manufacturing nuclear weapons," 
he said in the May edition of "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY." 
  Saying that he was simply talking of his personal opinion, 
Kim noted that there is no evidence that North Korea has 
conducted underground nuclear experiments. "If the North had 
done it, we would have detected it by seismograph," he said. 
  "It is presumed North Korea began extracting plutonium from 
1985, but I doubt whether they have the technology to 
manufacture (nuclear) weapons," Kim said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will have to 
reconsider the inter-Korean denuclearization declaration if 
Pyongyang continues to maintain a controversial radiochemical 
laboratory which is in fact a nuclear reprocessing plant, Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku says. 
  Speaking before the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and 
Unification Committee Monday, Yi said that "the joint 
denuclearization declaration has virtually been nullified in a 
sense and it will be a delicate problem how to handle the issue." 
  He said his government would spend much time and energy 
examining how to handle the validity of the declaration in light 
of "nuclear independence." 
  "We are now at the point where we have to study seriously 
how 
to handle the issue of validity of the declaration in case it 
was nullified, rather than just (get obsessed with) a vacuum 
(left by the nullification)," he said. "We will face a situation 
in which we will be compelled to discuss this problem for at 
least several months, or perhaps until next year, from a new 
angle," said Yi, who is also minister of the National 
Unification Board. 
  On the surface, the deputy premier's remarks can be viewed 
as 
a clear indication that the Seoul government intends to review 
the inter-Korean declaration on the denuclearization of the 
peninsula signed on Dec. 31, 1991. 
  Earlier, Yi said that if it was internationally confirmed 
that North Korea possesses "not just one but even one-half of a 
nuclear weapon," the denuclearization declaration would be 
regarded as nullified. 
  After he made that remark, Yi told reporters it was meant 
as"a message not only to North Korea but to the United States as 
well. " 
  Speaking to the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, 
Yi 
further clarified his purpose in making the remark. He said he 
had directed his statement at those in the United States, 
including Defense Secretary William Perry, who have said the 
international community would probably have to overlook North 
Korea's possession of one or two nuclear bombs. 
  Senior South Korean Government officials said the deputy 
prime minister's statement should be viewed as an unequivocal 
message to the United States that "Seoul would never accept a 
policy that allows North Korean possession of a nuclear weapon." 
  Yi's statement should be taken as an expression of the Seoul 
government's firm position that North Korea must be stopped from 
acquiring nuclear weapons at any cost, rather than merely as an 
expression of Seoul's intention to reconsider the declaration. 
  As evidence, Yi has always spoke by adding such conditional 
clauses as "if North Korea possessed nuclear weapons," or "if 
Pyongyang continues to maintain the nuclear reprocessing plant," 
and so on. In other words, if North Korea gave up its nuclear 
weapons program, there would be no need for reconsideration of 
the inter- Korean denuclearization declaration.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
include indirect support costs, such as outlays for real estate 
and personnel support and tax favors, in the won-based costs of 
the U.S. Forces in Korea (USFK). 
  For a more reasonable computation of the burden-sharing 
between the Korean and U.S. Governments, Seoul will introduce 
new criteria for determining the USFK's won-based costs. The 
new criteria will give the particulars of both direct and 
indirect support costs, and computing the costs by the new 
criteria will reduce Korea's share of the burden. The government 
will negotiate this policy with Washington in a meeting of the 
policy review subcommittee of the Security Consultative Meeting 
(SCM) slated for June 13-15 in Hawaii. 
  To be included in the USFK's won-based costs will be such 
indirect support costs as those for real estate used by U.S. 
troops, training grounds for the USFK, for the KATUSA (Korean 
Augmentation Troops to the American Army) soldiers assigned to 
the USFK, and tax favors to the USFK. 
  Washington has not recognized these indirect support costs 
as 
won-based costs of the USFK in past SCM sessions. Under an 
agreement reached at the 1991 SCM session, Korea must bear 
one-third of the USFK's won-based costs after 1995, and the 
government has to complete new negotiations to determine the 
amount it must bear after 1995 by next year. 
  A ranking government official says the concept of 
burden-sharing between the two countries should be redefined to 
include indirect support costs, as well as direct support costs, 
in the burden. 
  Previously the criteria for computing the USFK's won-based 
costs have been equivocal, resulting in gaps between the costs 
determined by the U.S. and Korean Governments, he said, adding 
there must be new unequivocal criteria for a reasonable 
determination of the costs. 
  The U.S. Government reportedly plans to have the Korean 
Government shoulder two-thirds of the USFK's won-based costs 
between 1996 and 1999 in spite of the 1991 agreement stipulating 
that Korea must bear one-third of the costs after 1995.

  [Text] Seoul, May 22 (YONHAP) -- Washington has begun to 
look into the damages on its industry following Seoul's virtual 
ban on American sausage imports at the recommendation by U.S. 
sausage producers to invoke Super 301 trade sanctions against 
Korea, a trade official here said Sunday. 
  The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) recently asked sausage 
manufacturers to submit details of their damages resulting from 
Korea's massive disposal of American sausages, the official said. 
  USTR also requested the producers to state their complaints 
and recommendations following Korea's shortening of shelf life 
to 30 days from former 90 days. 
  The American Sausage Producers Association had advised 
Washington to designate Korea as a priority foreign country in 
accordance with the Super 301 trade act for Seoul's cutting 
shelf life of American products and then disposing of them on 
the grounds that they are hazardous to public health. 
  "I think USTR began to investigate into the problem in order 
to present documental proof that Korea's action was unfair in 
future trade talks," the official said.

    [Editorial Report] On 22 May, ROK vernacular newspapers 
carry editorials and an article on the ongoing sausage dispute 
between the ROK and the United States. 
  On page 3, HANGYORE SINMUN carries an 800-word editorial 
entitled, "Customs Clearance of Deficient Sausages Cannot by Any 
Means Be Allowed--Rather Than Dissolving the Trade Friction, 
National Health Must Be Thought About First." The editorial 
starts off by explaining how the ROK and the United States are 
in discord because of the sausages. It criticizes the United 
States for continuing to pressure the ROK to import deficient 
sausages that are detrimental to people's health. Noting that 
the United States may suspend the extension of the economic 
cooperation dialogue between the two countries; apply the Super 
301 Section; and present the sausage dispute issue to the GATT, 
it stresses that the ROK must take resolute measures regarding 
this issue. It continues to emphasize that the people must not 
be allowed to eat such deficient sausages, urging that such a 
situation must be appealed to international organizations and 
the world's public opinion. The editorial concludes by saying 
that the government must never forget the fact that the 
settlement of the trade friction is important, but protecting 
the national health is more important. 
  On page 7, HANGYORE SINMUN carries an 800-word article by 
reporter An Chae-sung entitled, "The U.S. Trade Strategy as 
Revealed in the Sausage Dispute." The article starts off by 
saying that a U.S. Government document, obtained by HANGYORE 
SINMUN regarding the ROK-U.S. sausage dispute, notes that the 
U.S. State Department, the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative, the Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Embassy 
in the ROK, and ROK sausage manufacturers importing sausages are 
making all kinds of efforts to resolve the sausage issue. It 
says that since no result has been achieved, the U.S. side is 
actively examining the possibility of using the Super 301 
Section as a weapon to resolve the sausage dispute. The article 
continues to criticize the U.S. rationale on why it is 
inevitable to apply the Super 301 Section if the sausage dispute 
is not resolved. This editorial also says that the trade 
dispute between the ROK and the United States is not only 
limited to the sausage dispute but to the overall U.S. 
agricultural products and foodstuffs. 
  On page 3, CHUNGANG ILBO carried a 700-word editorial 
entitled, "Is the Super 301 Section Everything?" The editorial 
begins to express concern by saying that the strong measures the 
United States is planning to take against the ROK regarding the 
sausage dispute not only establishes a bad precedent in the 
ROK-U.S. trade, but it will also arouse the people's sentiment. 
It notes the one-sided theory of a big power saying that it 
will apply the Super 301 Section if the ROK does not abide by 
the U.S. demand. The editorial continues to note that the 
sausage dispute is an issue related to the safety of foodstuffs. 
It concludes by saying that foodstuffs officials from the two 
countries must exchange opinions on the safety of foodstuffs, 
and not carry out trade retaliations. 
  On page 3, KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries an 800-word editorial 
entitled, "Codfish Heads and the Super 301 Section." The 
editorial starts off by expressing disappointment over the 
government's decision to import U.S. codfish heads. Notes that 
such a decision was made because of the U.S. retaliation threat 
to apply the Super 301 Section if the codfish heads are not 
imported. Citing that such a threat also exists on the ongoing 
sausage dispute, the editorial urges the government to discuss 
this matter with related ministries and take resolute measures. 
The editorial concludes by saying that a resolution can be 
achieved in the sausage dispute and the codfish import issue 
only when a consistent trade strategy and tactic are established.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku said Tuesday the government embargo on inter-Korean 
economic cooperation will continue until the dispute over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program takes a favorable turn. 
  In a speech to the Federation of Korean Industries, Yi said 
inter-Korean economic cooperation including businessmen's visits 
to North Korea are not being allowed due to the nuclear problem, 
adding that "this will continue until the nuclear dispute takes 
a turn for the better." 
  He said, however, that the government will take a flexible 
attitude toward economic cooperation, considering the 
development of the nuclear issue, in preparation for a variety 
of opportunities that may come with the settlement of the 
nuclear row. Yi was speaking before a group of businessmen 
interested in South-North Korean trade at an event arranged by 
Rep. Kang Kyong-sik of the Democratic Liberal Party and Rep. Yi 
Pu-yong of the Democratic Party. 
  The participants, from major business groups, insisted on a 
positive line in South-North trade to ensure economic 
development in the long term, although they understand the 
government's position of linking economic cooperation with the 
nuclear problem.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The government has made 
the first decision to protect five North Koreans who sought 
refuge in South Korea several months ago under the related law 
which came into effect last Dec. 11, officials said Monday. 
  According to "the law to protect the North Korean 
compatriots 
who sought refuge in the South," the government should convene a 
committee of officials from related ministries to decide whether 
to assist North Koreans within 30 days of their request for 
protection from the health and social affairs minister. 
  The committee, sponsored by the Health and Social Affairs 
Ministry, recently decided to offer protection to four North 
Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps including Kim 
Kil-song, 31, and Kwon Ki-hae, 53, who fled North Korea through 
a third country. 
  Under the law, the government will give each refuge seeker 
14.7 million won (about 18,300 U.S. dollars) for resettlement 
and 7 million won to rent a small apartment. 
  The decision is attracting attention because more North 
Koreans have been seeking refuge in the South recently, the 
officials said.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Choe Tu-sam in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Western and business sources in Beijing said on 22 
May that the 105-storey Yugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, which had 
been left unfinished, has been slowly leaning to one side since 
the early nineties due to inadequate foundation groundwork. 
  Therefore, the North Korean authorities recently invited 
Chinese civil engineering and construction experts to find out 
ways to make the hotel stand straight. The five-man Chinese 
team stayed in Pyongyang for a week and studied the building 
extensively. The team returned to China after saying that "we 
have no technology to make the building stand straight." 
  A source says: No information is available on which 
direction the building is leaning. However, given various 
circumstances, the building does not seem to have tilted to the 
extent easily recognizable to the naked eye. 
  A business source in Beijing says: The Yugyong Hotel is 
leaning because of inadequate foundation work. As a result, it 
is difficult to install elevators and other high-technology 
equipment in the hotel. And, it is difficult to find foreign 
companies that do interior work. This has been cautiously said 
for a long time in business circles. 
  A diplomatic source says: North Korea had made every effort 
to build the hotel since the mid-eighties. It even mobilized 
soldiers. It managed to finish the foundation, structure, and 
brick work. However, when a French joint-venture company 
withdrew from the construction work, North Korea tried to have a 
Hong Kong company finish the construction, but failed to reach 
an agreement with the company on the interior work. As a 
result, the construction work has stopped, and the hotel has 
been left unfinished. North Korea failed to reach agreement 
with the Hong Kong company because the payment conditions for 
the $500 million-worth interior work were not good and because 
North Korea did not accept the Hong Kong company's demand that 
after the hotel construction is finished it be allowed to 
participate in the hotel management by directly controlling and 
supervising 200 of its employees. 
  However, business circles think that there will be many 
difficult technical in addition to monetary problems. It is 
also speculated that there are many difficulties North Korean 
technology cannot resolve, including supplying water to the 
105-storey building and making the top stories of the building 
flexible enough to withstand typhoons. It is also speculated 
that the French company left and a Hong Kong company refused to 
do the interior work not because of the financial problems but 
because of difficulties to do the interior work due to the 
shoddy workmanship of the structure. 
  North Korea has tried hard to build this hotel to display 
the 
honor of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and give boundless pride 
to its people. North Korea can neither dismantle the hotel nor 
proceed with the construction. As a result, the hotel now seems 
to be a skeletal "ghost house" that typifies the North Korean 
economic reality.

    [Editorial Report] ROK citizens who want to visit Mt. 
Paektu must obtain an entry permit from the Jilin provincial 
government before they can apply for a Chinese entry visa. The 
3 May KYONGHYANG SINMUN reports on page 21 that the PRC 
Government will enforce the requirement beginning on 1 June this 
year. Due to the Seoul government's lifting its China travel 
restrictions in April, the Jilin area is inundated with South 
Korean tourists, causing "terrible shortages in transportation, 
lodging, and so on." The PRC Government is also concerned about 
the impact on the area's environment as well as for the safety 
and security of the visitors. 
  According to KYONGHYANG SINMUN, South Koreans who want to 
visit Mt. Paektu will have to start processing their travel 
documents at least 30 days in advance. All the paperwork must 
be processed by PRC Government-designated Chinese travel 
agencies. The PRC plans strict implementation of the new 
requirements. Koreans without proper papers will not be allowed 
to visit Mt. Paektu and they will not be able to purchase 
airline tickets to other cities in Jilin Province and the use of 
hotels will be denied.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
reportedly said Monday North Korea should give up its nuclear 
program and try to solve problems on the Korean peninsula 
through dialogue with South Korea as well as the United States. 
  President Kim made the statement in answer to a question on 
what message he wants to send to North Korea through his June 
1-4 visit to Russia at a press conference with Russian 
correspondents here Monday. 
  Kim was known to have welcomed Moscow's proposal on holding 
an international conference attended by South and North Korea, 
Russia, China, Japan, the United States, the United Nations and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an expression 
of its intention to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear 
problem. 
  He added, however, that it will take a little longer for 
these parties to determine whether such a conference would 
efficiently help settle the nuclear dispute. 
  Noting that he believes Russia is firmly opposed to North 
Korea's production of nuclear weapons, Kim said he will study 
ways to cooperate in the nuclear issue at summit meetings with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Article by political affairs desk reporter Kim Chae-hong: </F>
"Russia's `Rude Diplomacy' and Our Countermeasures," from the 
"Reporter's Eyes" column] 
  [Text] Blind points in the government's diplomacy on Russia 
have been revealed in the wake of President Kim Yong-sam's visit 
to Russia slated for 1 June. The incidents that recently showed 
the blind points in ROK-Russia relations are, in general, two: 
One is the 20 May IZVESTIA report that "there is a possibility 
that Russia will supply weapon parts to North Korea," and the 
other is Russia's diplomatic rudeness in the postponement of the 
ROK-Russia joint economic committee meeting--scheduled to be 
held in Seoul on 20 and 21 May--by unilaterally breaching the 
agreement with the ROK. These diplomatic blind points were 
revealed after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to Russia 
from 13 to 15 April and after Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's 
visit to Russia from 28 April to 3 May, respectively. Thus, 
voices raised criticizing the government for problems existing 
in implementing its foreign policies. 
  One should consider that sale of weapon parts is deeply 
related to Russia's policy on the Korean peninsula, going beyond 
a mere happening. To increase the North Korean battle strength, 
under the circumstances in which North and South Korea have not 
achieved a peace mechanism, cannot but be defined as a hostile 
act against us. Russia established diplomatic relations with the 
ROK and has maintained a friendly atmosphere with us to date 
while using $1.57 billion of money we offered as a loan. 
However, heated debates took place between the two nations 
regarding the method of loan payment, as to whether to pay it 
with raw materials or weapons. Amid such debate, the issue of 
supplying weapon parts to North Korea was raised. 
  Russia put forward a logic that by supplying weapon parts to 
North Korea, it can "exert influence on North Korea." This logic 
is the same as the response that Russia showed when our Defense 
Ministry demanded in July 1992 that "the article on military 
alliance specified in the DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty on 
Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance should be 
amended." 
  Article 1 in the DPRK-Russia treaty stipulates that if North 
Korea is invaded by outside forces, the Russian Armed Forces 
shall automatically interfere in this. Although Russia admits 
that this article, an outcome of the Cold War era, is not 
appropriate at the present stage, it refused to amend the 
article. Instead, Russia has informed the North Korean side 
verbally of the abolition of the article pertaining to its 
automatic interference. But Russia has not amended the written 
text of the article. This is the very status of relations 
between North Korea and Russia. This means that whenever 
necessary, the validity of this article can be recovered at any 
time. Our government pointed out the following four issues as 
major impending problems between the ROK and Russia: First, 
payment of economic cooperation loans; second, defection of 
North Korean loggers; third, compensation for downing the Korean 
Airline passenger plane; and fourth, the land of former Russian 
mission in Seoul. 
  It seems that Russia's military security policy toward the 
Korean peninsula should be included in pending issues to be 
discussed with the Russian side when President Kim Yong-sam 
visits Russia.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The diplomatic 
importance of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to South Korea was 
driven home during Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit here 
this week, especially with the North Korean nuclear controvery 
looming in the background. 
  Han came to Jakarta eight days before a meeting of NAM 
foreign ministers, held every three years, in Cairo where the 
North Korean nuclear issue, in connection with an overall review 
of the situation on the Korean peninsula, will be addressed for 
the first time. 
  "It's important that we make clear where we stand on the 
North Korean nuclear problem, that NAM take our position into 
account when the foreign ministers' meeting convenes," said Yu 
Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the 
South Korean Foreign Ministry. 
  The foreign ministers are expected to adopt a final document 
through consensus and the wording of the clause on the nuclear 
impasse, if it in any way leans toward South Korea, will have no 
small impact considering Pyongyang's ties with NAM. 
  North Korea keeps its third largest embassy in Jakarta with 
a 
25-member staff. Current Ambassador Ham Pong-ha has been here 
for four years. Diplomatic officials say the embassy functions 
as a base camp for North Korea's diplomatic lobbying activities 
in Southeast Asia as well as Australia and New Zealand. 
  Indonesia, as the chair of NAM, could serve as South Korea's 
window to the group by reflecting its position without Seoul 
actually being there, bringing the movement more toward the 
center between the two Koreas. 
  It is hoped that Han's visit will add force to Seoul's 
efforts to achieve this objective. 
  Indonesia's stance on the nuclear issue was too ambivalent 
from Seoul's point of view as late as last January, when Jakarta 
kept visibly silent as the UN Security Council adopted a 
resolution urging Pyongyang to comply with International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. 
  South Korea felt compelled to step up its persuasion of 
Indonesia, hoping in turn to reach NAM. 
  Then in March, President Suharto sent one of his ambassadors 
to North Korea as a special envoy. The following month, North 
Korea sent Vice Foreign Minister Kim Chang-kyu to Jakarta. 
  This activity produced a letter from President Suharto, 
speaking as NAM chairman, to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali saying the group wanted to see the problem solved 
through dialogue, but that North Korea should accept IAEA 
inspections and remain within the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) regime. 
  Seoul officials say this stance was the product of much 
convincing by South Korea and international organizations. The 
global consensus obviously helped as the issue has been recycled 
through IAEA, United Nations and Security Council statements and 
resolutions, they say. 
  South Korea's ties with NAM will receive a more potent boost 
when President Kim Yong-sam comes here for the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November. The Seoul 
government expects a Kim-Suharto summit during the APEC 
conference. 
  The presidents will likely go over again, at the highest 
level, where they stand on the nuclear controversy while 
strengthening their two-way relationship.

  [Text] Ho Chi Minh, May 22 (YONHAP) -- The former Korean 
Community Center in Ho Chi Minh is expected to be returned to 
South Korea next month, an official at the Korean Embassy in 
Vietnam said Sunday. The consulate general in Ho Chi Minh has 
been demanding quick return of the property and the city has 
recently notified that it will hand over the building within the 
first half of the year, the official said. 
  The government reportedly plans to use the site as cultural 
center and school for Koreans in Vietnam. An estimated 800 
Koreans, including diplamats and expatriates, live here and 
education problem for their children may be resolved to some 
extent if the center is turned into a school, the official said. 
The 162-pyong [one pyong is six square feet] two-storey building 
had been used as a school and Taekwondo gym until 1975 when 
Korean troops withdrew from Saigon after if fell to communism 
and broke diplomatic ties. Seoul and Hanoi restored full 
relations in December 1992. 
  Koreans here have to send their children to expensive 
international schools in Malaysia, Taiwan or Singapore because 
there are no Korean schools in Vietnam.

  [Text] The National Assembly Foreign Affairs and 
Unification Committee held a plenary meeting today with the 
presence of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of 
the National Unification Board [NUB], for an interpellation 
after being briefed on the North Korean nuclear issue and the 
policy regarding North Korea. 
  During today's meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku 
said 
in his report that North Korea is showing an intention to link 
the nuclear fuel rods replacement with the third-round talks 
with the United States, and that the government will further 
strengthen the cooperation system with the United States prior 
to the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-ku said that North Korea is 
trying to make a political issue out of the defection of loggers 
from Siberia saying that they were kidnapped, and that if this 
becomes excessive, the government will take head-on measures, 
including taking issue of North Korea's human rights. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi added that the government has 
established a policy to accept all those who wish to defect in 
the future to the extent that does not agitate a third country. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku reported that inter-Korean 
trade has been allowed even in the situation that the 
North-South relations are blocked due to the North Korean 
nuclear issue, and that this year's inter-Korean trade as of 
April showed approximately a $7-million increase over the same 
period last year at $65 million. However, Deputy Prime Minister 
Yi said North-South economic cooperation, including ROK 
businessmen's visit to North Korea, will not be allowed until 
the nuclear issue turns to a positive direction. 
  During the morning session of the Foreign Affairs and 
Unification Committee meeting, the ruling and opposition parties 
once had disagreement over the demand for information concerning 
Chairman Kim Tae-chung's remarks made in the United States and 
the method of the questions and answers.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The government stressed 
the need for labor-management cooperation at a high-level policy 
meeting held Monday to review the five-year "new economy" 
development plan, in the belief that labor may hold back an 
economy which is recovering from recession at a relatively rapid 
pace. 
  Specially invited to attend the meeting were the top 
executive officers of 30 large business groups and their union 
leaders, who viewed a film showing how Goldstar Co. has achieved 
worker-management cooperation after experiencing harsh labor 
disputes in the late 1980s. 
  Last year, the government had to stimulate the economy to 
lift it from a drawn-out recession and encourage industrialists 
to demonstrate an enterprising spirit as few signs of recovery 
were evident. In 1994, however, the government has shifted its 
policy focus to inflation and labor as the economy shows signs 
of a relatively rapid recovery. 
  Earlier this year, the government was battling inflation 
triggered by hikes in public utility fees. As a result, 
inflation began slowing down in April and was brought under 
control in May. Compared with the extreme labor actions at 
Hyundai group companies and other large factories last year, 
disputes by workers have been moderate so far this year. But 
the government is worried about a recurrence of violent labor 
strikes as the economy is moving upward. 
  As of the end of April, about 30 percent of large companies 
had completed collective wage bargaining, up 8 percentage points 
over a year earlier. Only 16.8 percent of the companies 
affiliated with the 30 large business groups, however, had done 
so. 
  Moreover, Hyundai group and shipbuilding industry unions are 
moving to organize a separate industrial union from the 
Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), while the unions of 
some large companies have already announced their defection from 
the FKTU. 
  There are thus indications that the FKTU-led labor community 
is facing a drastic restructuring -- to the extent of charting a 
new course for the labor movement. Under these circumstances, 
the government hopes to turn labor-management relations from 
conflict to cooperation this year. Toward that end, it has 
decided to take steps to reduce industrial accidents, expand 
vocational training programs and improve working conditions. 
  In implementing these measures the cooperation of employers, 
especially the chairmen of the 30 large business groups, is 
badly needed, and this is why the government invited the 30 
corporate leaders to Monday's high-level policy meeting. 
  Noted in the meeting were the economy's upward movement at a 
relatively fast pace and the need for early industrial 
restructuring to prepare for the end of the era of the three 
lows -- low oil prices, low interest rates and low exchange 
value of the won. During the first three-lows era in the 1980s, 
the economy failed at industrial restructuring, bringing about a 
downturn in 1990. To keep the economy from suffering another 
such downturn, the government plans to restructure industry 
while it is still brisk on the strength of the three lows. 
  The economy is finally on the rise after emerging from a 
long 
tunnel lasting over three years. The government plans to start 
restructuring industry during this upswing to prevent the 
recurrence of a slump due to the failure of such restructuring 
efforts in the late 1980s.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Monday that businesses promoting labor-management 
cooperation would receive increased government support while 
those hit by sustained labor disputes would face "disadvantages." 
  Presiding over a high-level meeting on the five-year new 
economy development plan held at the Korea Foreign Trade 
Association, he instructed the cabinet to develop a concrete and 
practical policy to promote labor-management harmony in all 
industries. 
  Participating in the meeting were related cabinet ministers 
and the top executive officers and union leaders of the 
country's 30 largest business groups. 
  Noting that labor-management cooperation is necessary for 
Korean companies to survive in an era of limitless trade 
competition, he said the absence of such harmony would make it 
impossible to boost products' international competitiveness 
through technological innovations. 
  Cooperative labor-management relations should be established 
on the basis of mutual trust, rather than solely the law, he 
stressed. Kim exhorted the 30 largest business groups' leaders 
to improve working conditions for their employees while 
respecting them as human beings. He then advised the groups' 
union leaders to correct the view that confrontation and 
struggle is the only way for workers to survive, urging them to 
explain the need for mutual dependence and co-existence as 
businesses and the government must also be mutually dependent 
and co-exist. 
  Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok said the 
government 
would provide incentives for increased labor-management 
cooperation, such as tax breaks for corporate investment in 
welfare facilities for workers.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- A majority of South 
Koreans believe that democratization has made considerable 
progress under the Kim Yong-sam administration compared with 
those of his two immediate predecessors. An opinion poll found, 
however, that Koreans also think there has been little 
meaningful change in "the quality of life." 
  Compared with President Chon Tu-hwan's government, cleaning 
up corruption, fair trials, protection of human rights and 
equality for women have made great strides under the Kim 
administration, many people said. But the present government has 
achieved little in the areas of law and order, medical welfare 
and housing, they said. 
  The opinion poll, conducted by the Social Science Research 
Center of Seoul National University, involved 1,198 men and 
women above the age of 20 across the nation. Titled 
"Democratization and the Quality of Life," the poll was 
commissioned by the Education Ministry. Conducted since November 
1993 and giving no figures for margin of error, the report was 
published Monday. 
  Asked to rate democratization on a scale of one to 10 with 
the lowest score representing "complete dictatorship" and 10 
denoting "complete democracy," the Chon Tu-hwan regime earned 
3.35 points, the No Tae-u government 4.85 points and the Kim 
administration 6.63 points. 
  With regard to the quality of life, the pollees gave 4.53 
points to the Chon government and 5.82 points to President Kim. 
  Concerning their expectations for an improved quality of 
life 
in five years, provided that the current democratization efforts 
succeed, the respondents gave 7.04 points. If, on the other 
hand, democratization fails and the military grabs power again, 
the quality of life will plunge, they said, giving only 3.98 
points in that event. 
  Asked about the quality of life for the nation as a whole, 
the Chon administration received 4.57 points and the Kim 
government 5.88 points. Had Chon Tu-hwan continued to rule the 
country, the people thought the quality of national life right 
now would rate 4.65 points, the poll found. 
  Invited to predict the situation five years from now if 
democratization succeeds, the quality of life earned 7.5 points. 
The figure plunged to 4.01 points when the pollees were asked to 
predict life in five years under a military government. 
  Queried on the impact democratization has had on the quality 
of economic life, political activities and individual 
lifestyles, 52.6 percent replied that there has been little 
effect. Some 40.2 percent felt there has been a "slight" 
improvement in their lives because of democratization while 2.4 
percent said "very much." Some 3.7 percent said the quality of 
life has worsened slightly while 0.7 percent said it has become 
"very bad." 
  Asked to evaluate the Kim administration's reforms and 
classify them into three categories -- success, no change or 
failure -- the approval rating for cleaning up corruption was 
86.5 percent, fair trials (63.9 percent), reflecting the 
people's wishes in government policies (57.1 percent), 
guarantees on equality for women, (54.4 percent) and protection 
of human rights (50.4 percent). 
  On the whole, 50 percent of the respondents said the Kim 
administration has succeeded in its reform efforts. 
  On the other hand, the approval rating for equal 
distribution 
of wealth was a mere 32.6 percent, establishment of law and 
order (35 percent), housing problems (35.6 percent), medical 
welfare system (38.6 percent), rise in educational opportunities 
(24.2 percent), press responsibility (49.1) and economic 
development (49. 1 percent). 
  When asked to single out the most important element in 
democracy's development, 24.5 percent said a guarantee of 
economic well-being: 23.2 percent opted for economic 
development: 20.8 percent for fair and just execution of the 
law: 15.9 percent for elimination of the gap between the haves 
and have-nots: 10.2 percent for political freedom, and 4.7 
percent for free competition among political parties.

    [Editorial Report] The 30 April edition of KUNGMIN ILBO on 
page 4 reports on an elite men's private organization, the Seoul 
Forum. The author, Han Pyong-kwon, said that with only 52 
members, the Forum is the "ultimate in elite men's private 
organizations in South Korea". Membership is by invitation 
only. The Forum's members come from various fields: academia, 
media, law, business, and economics. Each member is expected to 
be well-versed in international politics. 
  The Forum was established in October 1986. Han Pyong-kwon 
noted that the Forum's organizers believed that Korea needed a 
non-political and non-government organization to exchange 
information, analyze and assess international trends quickly and 
independently. 
  Charter members were Han Sung-chu (current Foreign Minister, 
then Korea University professor), Yi Sang-u (Sogan University 
professor), and Yi Hong-ku (current Deputy Prime Minister, then 
Seoul National University professor). In addition, the Forum's 
current membership from academia includes An Pyong-chun, Chong 
Ku-hyon, Kim Tal-chung, Kim Se-won, Yu Se-hui, Chong Chong-uk 
(current presidential advisor). The economic sector's elite 
include Sagong Il (former Minister of Finance) and Pak Yong-chol 
(Director of the Financial Training Institute). The national 
security arena is respresented by Yi Tong-pok (former NSP 
official, North Korea expert). The legal sector has Yi Hoe-chang 
(former Prime Minister). The business sector has Kim U-chung 
(Chairman of the Daewoo Group), Cho Sok-nae (Chairman of the 
Hyosong Group) and Pak Song-nyong (Chairman of the Kumho Group). 
The Forum's current chairman is Kim Kyong-won, former 
ambassador to the United States.

"Outstanding Individually, Weak Organizationally"] 
  [Excerpts] The place: the export promotion section of the 
Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy 
[MOTIE]. In the recent government reorganization, the name of 
the Trade Bureau changed from Commercial Trade Bureau and, with 
this change, the bureau has yielded its leading position among 
all the bureaus of the ministry to the International Trade 
Policy Bureau. Nevertheless, the Trade Bureau, and its export 
promotion section in particular, is still regarded as the cream 
of MOTIE. 
  In the days when "building an export-oriented state" was a 
catchphrase, the Trade Bureau racked its brains to map out 
export strategies. For anyone seeking to make his way as a 
trade and industry bureaucrat, this bureau was the gateway he 
had to go through to get on the "elite track." The elite 
bureaucrats in MOTIE who have passed through this gate during 
the past several decades proudly recall the hard times they went 
through and the exploits they performed during their service 
with the Trade Bureau as the most glorious part of their 
"career." 
  Even now the finest talent in this ministry are drawn into 
the export promotion section. But this section, the veritable 
command post for the nation's export and import business, does 
not have on hand much statistical data that are essential to 
keep abreast of the trends of world trade. [passage omitted] 
  Employees of MOTIE's export promotion section get such data 
from the Korean Traders Association or the Korean Trade 
Promotion Corporation. They need the help of the Bank of Korea, 
the Korea Development Institute, the Korea Institute for 
Industrial Economics and Trade, and other semi-government 
research institutes for information on the domestic and 
international economic trends they need in working out export 
measures. In a word, they are fighting in the battlefield of 
world trade without even a single military map. [passage 
omitted] 
  When it comes to various research materials on exports and 
imports published by world organizations or academic 
institutions, the situation is all the more deplorable. These 
materials are almost beyond MOTIE's reach in most cases. 
  Says a young grade 5 official: "When we request a budget 
allocation to get those materials stressing that we cannot do 
without them, we are turned down in most cases. The reason 
given is that there are not enough budgetary resources. The 
section which is supposed to have overall charge of imports and 
exports does not have the latest research materials, and even 
the most basic statistical materials for that matter, to consult 
when it wants to check on the current and future trends in 
trade. It has to beg other organizations for them. Naturally, 
the section's analytic ability is weak. Under these 
circumstances, how do you expect to create conditions conducive 
to widening our horizon?" 
  The young official laments that his organization is apt to 
be 
"information-blind" when it has little opportunity to keep 
abreast of (or get materials on) the cultures of advanced 
countries. 
  The slogan "internationalization" has become a buzzword of 
our time uttered even by children. This slogan began to spread 
late last year at the initiative of senior officials and the 
press. President Kim Yong-sam set forth internationalization as 
a major goal of our government for this year. The 
Administration is in step with this policy. A government-wide 
campaign to remodel the mindset toward the economy is under way 
in gear with the campaign for internationalization. Ministries 
are vying with each other to have their employees revamp their 
way of thinking through retraining courses offered on a 
commission basis by private corporations reputed to be leaders 
in internationalization. 
  Reflecting the definition that internationalization in its 
narrower sense means "economic internationalization," economic 
ministries are more active in their efforts for 
internationalization than others. Under the policy of 
modernizing economic structures, deregulation is under way in 
all areas as if it were the "order of the day," with each 
ministry mapping out diversified strategies for 
internationalization. 
  However, many critics are skeptical about the role and 
function of the government in leading the internationalization 
drive. To begin with, there is controversy over the concept. 
But internationalization is of great significance as a 
strategic means for national survival in the age of a borderless 
economic war. To survive in the age of a global village, we 
should exert an effort to adapt our way of thinking and systems 
to international changes and elevate them to advanced 
international standards from a national strategic point of view. 
To adapt ourselves to the changing international situation and 
to survive in it, it is imperative to do away with 
ultranationalism and isolationist practices and search for the 
loftier common good of the world and accept it on our own. This 
idea holds good as the concept of internationalization. 
  From this point of view, the role of the government as the 
steward of the national economy should be highlighted. The 
private sector is the runner, but it is the duty of the 
government to make it run well. Under an incompetent and 
uninformed government, the private sector--the command post of 
the borderless war--would sink in the high tide of opening up to 
the outside world, directly endangering the very survival and 
prosperity of the country. If any regulation is binding the 
hands and feet of private enterprises and making them powerless 
in the borderless economic war, the government should lose no 
time in easing such regulation; and when obstacles stand in the 
way of our enterprises in their efforts for 
internationalization, it should actively remove them. [passage 
omitted] 
  In fact, economic laws and systems have been established and 
have operated as if their purpose were to block rather than 
stimulate free business activity. In the name of protecting our 
industry, the government imposed so many cumbersome conditions 
on foreign firms trying to enter our market that foreigners 
brand Korea as "a country with the worst investment conditions." 
[passage omitted] 
  Some critics go so far as to brand our government a "force 
resisting internationalization." This criticism is directed at 
the state of affairs in which the government, instead of leading 
the effort to revamp outmoded systems and ease various 
regulatory controls, is playing only a passive role, unable to 
free itself from isolationist thinking. 
  In some quarters there is a manifestation of the extreme 
distrust that officials are fettered so much by departmental 
egoism that they are reluctant to deregulate, or they are 
concerned so much about their job security that they are 
absorbed in devising still more controls. Of all government 
organizations, the economic ministries, such as the Economic 
Planning Board (regarded as the originator for all economic 
policies), the Ministry of Finance [MOF], and MOTIE become the 
main target of criticism whenever internationalization becomes 
an issue. This is because when we hold "economic 
internationalization" or "the internationalization of policy" as 
the cardinal point, these ministries are the principal agents in 
implementing internationalization policy. 
  Objectively, it is valid to say that the economic ministries 
have a better sense of internationalization than others. For 
one thing, these ministries are crowded with the elites who 
passed the difficult higher civil service examination, and by 
the nature of their business they have had ample opportunity to 
come into contact with developments abroad in the age of the 
global economy. Yet they remain the target of criticism because 
they are not playing a positive role in the vanguard of the 
drive for "economic internationalization." 
  True, underlying this criticism is the view--and the eager 
expectation based on it--that the success of 
internationalization depends on the efforts of the economic 
ministries to remake themselves. 
  Before determining why they are being criticized as "a 
backward group in the internationalization drive," we should 
first examine their objective conditions. We cannot 
categorically condemn economic bureaucrats, for quite a lot of 
them are working hard in their own way with a sense of duty to 
the state. [passage omitted] 
  The stark realities of absurdly low government salaries 
compared with those in private firms, and the ever- increasing 
jam in personnel appointments are far more serious than the 
general public thinks. 
  The economic administrative bureaucracy is regarded as an 
elite group among all classes of our society. These outstanding 
people huddle together all night mapping out national policies. 
But one wonders why these ministries are regarded as backward 
when it comes to internationalization. 
  Each official is outstanding individually, but as a group 
the 
ministries are not. This proves that their organization has 
internal structural flaws. It is no exaggeration to say that 
the nature of the bureaucracy and its inefficiency are principal 
factors impeding the internationalization of the government 
organization and its devoted personnel. 
  The climate that causes "information blindness," and the 
kind 
of customary practices in MOTIE's export promotion section cited 
above are points worthy of note. [passage omitted] 
  Private enterprises are constantly making efforts to adapt 
to 
changes by giving full play to their creativeness. But the 
bureaucracy still hangs on to old ways when the country was in 
the initial stage of a development-oriented economy. In this 
age of radical change, the gap between "running enterprises" and 
the "crawling bureaucracy" is bound to widen. Economic 
bureaucrats argue that their ministries were ahead of private 
business in internationalization until the mid- 1980's. 
  "In the early 1980's it was easier for the economic 
ministries than for other ministries to obtain foreign data and 
meet with foreign businessmen and collect information from them. 
But with the arrival of the period of surplus balance of 
payments in the mid-1980's, private enterprises began to turn 
their eyes overseas relying on the know-how and resources they 
had accumulated." 
  Says a section chief in the Economic Planning Board: "Those 
enterprises which previously depended chiefly on government 
assistance in export-import activities now began to speed up the 
pace in setting up overseas branches and to dispatch their 
employees for on-the-spot training overseas, thereby making 
themselves internationalization-minded." 
  While doing business overseas, they gained access to 
information and were able to turn out a large number of 
personnel versed in the languages of their host countries. As a 
consequence they naturally had ample opportunity to get 
accustomed to the way of thinking and behavior of foreigners and 
the cultures of advanced countries. On the contrary, 
bureaucrats complain that they could find relatively little 
opportunity to get in touch with the advanced cultures partly 
because of budgetary constraints and partly because of the 
public sentiment that "looks askance at government employees 
traveling abroad." 
  Argues a grade 5 MOF official: "Government employees often 
talk about internationalization. But what other sources of 
knowledge on internationalization do you think they have except 
papers written by domestic scholars and newspaper articles? They 
have little opportunity to travel abroad, much less to train 
overseas and get accustomed to foreign lands and people. Under 
these circumstances, it seems too much to demand that they get 
rid of their narrow outlook." 
  The above explanation of why the bureaucrat lags behind big 
private corporations in awareness of internationalization is 
valid to some extent. Samsung, which ranks at the top among our 
big business groups, has sent hundreds of its employees abroad 
at its expense each year for the past several years. Needless 
to say, this is patterned after the management style of advanced 
Japanese enterprises. But certainly, it is a radical idea. Now 
many other firms are following suit? 
  When these corporations send employees abroad, they 
encourage 
them to get acquainted with as many people in their host 
countries as possible and learn their customs, without worrying 
about the company business. Our firms have come up with the 
idea that going abroad and adapting oneself to the culture of 
the host country will in itself provide an opportunity to 
cultivate an international sense. This is proof that our 
corporations are adroitly taking measures to promote "the 
internationalization of human resources," and through it "the 
internationalization of ability." 
  What about the bureaucracy? In a word the climate of our 
officialdom is keeping its members ignorant of what is going on 
in the outside world. While private firms are actively sending 
employees abroad for work or study at company expense, the 
government--because of all kinds of restrictions--fails to 
provide an adequate opportunity for its employees to go abroad. 
Private citizens have been free to travel abroad since the 
mid-1980's when the government liberalized foreign travel 
restrictions. But for government employees, foreign travel is 
still beyond their reach in most cases. 
  In this connection, one must mention problems relating to 
the 
screening of applications for official travel abroad and 
government employees' overseas training. In fact, civil 
servants' foreign trips are currently restricted by the 
screening system. All overseas trips for official business 
require advance approval. Even when a government employee wants 
to take a vacation abroad with his family, he has to get the 
approval of the head of his organization. [passage omitted] 
  Government employees study abroad under various 
arrangements: 
the government-wide program under which personnel are selected 
by the Ministry of Government Administration for study abroad at 
state expense; the program of each ministry under which it sends 
its selected employees at its own budgetary expense; the use of 
an IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] 
credit (under the jurisdiction of the MOF); the use of 
cooperation funds of foreign countries; the use of special funds 
including those tied to special trade contracts; the use of the 
Humphrey and Fulbright Funds and various university scholarships. 
  The number of government employees sent abroad under the 
Ministry of Government Administration's program of study abroad 
at state expense is very limited, with only about two for each 
ministry on average. That is why the competition is so keen 
that in major ministries where many employees have passed the 
higher civil service examination--such as the Economic Planning 
Board, the MOF, and MOTIE--officials have to prepare for several 
years to get selected for study abroad. [passage omitted] 
  Another major problem is the failure to assign those 
employees who returned after studying abroad to the right jobs 
and make the best use of them. There are quite a few employees 
in MOTIE who have returned home after studying law overseas. 
They studied law abroad to make the best use of their expert 
knowledge in the area of trade and commerce. But for 
administrative reasons of personnel management, these employees 
upon their return from abroad are often assigned to positions in 
industrial fields rather than in the field of trade and 
commerce. In this way they are deprived of the best opportunity 
to make the best use of the expertise which they studied so hard 
to acquire. 
  The sector of MOTIE that deals with trade matters may be 
said 
to be "the vanguard of internationalization." The ability to 
speak English is an essential requirement, but the time is gone 
when a man with only a good knowledge of the English knowledge 
could pass as a trade expert. To be able to resolve complex 
trade issues and promote national interests through sticky 
negotiations, one needs to have expert knowledge on the matters 
on hand. It is not an easy thing to find people with an expert 
judicial knowledge in our government sector which deals with 
trade. When a legal problem crops up, the government could use 
international lawyers in our country, but these lawyers cannot 
participate in the policy-making process. [passage omitted] 
  A grade-v official made this comment: "As a matter of fact, 
there is little chance of training trade experts among 
government employees under the current personnel policy and 
method of organizational management. When a trade expert is 
transferred to an industrial department, his transfer should be 
temporary for the purpose of gaining experience there to deepen 
his expertise on trade. But in our country, that is not the 
case. Our government pursues a personnel policy of 
mass-producing generalists. [passage omitted] What is more 
deplorable is that those who returned home from abroad after 
studying law are assigned to jobs which have nothing to with 
their specialities in law." 
  In MOTIE, there is a trade expert who has a license to 
practice international law. But he is working in the industrial 
sector (electronics) of the ministry. 
  Young grade-v officials who have gained a vision for 
internationalization while handling trade matters argue that the 
current overseas training programs should be shortened from the 
current one- to two-year period to three to six months. The 
reason is that what is needed is not lectures on theory but a 
practical course that will give trainees an ability to resolve 
pesky trade disputes through negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  The following are the words of a certain bureau chief who 
once served as a international cooperation officer at MOTIE: 
  "An international cooperation officer must handle all kinds 
of negotiations: UR, OECD ship-building, and multilateral steel. 
He must go to Geneva or Brussels each time there is a 
conference. When I was on an official trip, a Japanese official 
gave a dubious look when he saw me. He said to me, "You must be 
very powerful." I just laughed it off. But I felt ashamed 
inside. In Japan's case, the officials attending specific 
negotiations are seasoned veterans with years of experience in 
their specialty. In our country, when an official takes charge 
of negotiations after drifting from place to place under the 
government's personnel management practice, he attends 
negotiations in every field. This can be found only in the 
bureaucracies of developing countries." 
  The organizational structure of our government and the 
inefficient way of performing official business are other major 
factors that make government employees blind to the needs for 
internationalization. Our government still maintains the same 
organizational structure established in the 1960's when the 
country was absorbed in economic development. Government 
functions are not rationally distributed among ministries, and 
this often generates interagency squabbles going beyond the 
level of controversy, impeding efficiency. 
  In competing with foreign countries, information on them is 
essential. But the total number of government employees 
stationed abroad is slightly over 200 from 21 ministries and 
agencies. These officers use their positions as stepping-stones 
for promotion and are more interested in accommodating 
high-ranking officials on overseas trips than in prompt 
reporting of accurate information on their host countries. 
  Working conditions of government employees is poor compared 
with that of private firms. Private firms have introduced 
various office automation systems, But the computer terminals in 
ministries and agencies are primitive. [passage omitted] 
  Private firms already have high-tech systems and are 
generating paperless reports and holding conversations and 
making decisions via computer. On the contrary, government 
employees prepare each report on dozens of sheets of paper and 
submit it to higher authorities. [passage omitted] 
  It is unreasonable to force only the economic ministries to 
remold their thinking when the public's thinking is not remolded 
to an advanced level. [passage omitted] 
  Our people are not happy about foreign firms remitting their 
profits to their home countries. When our firms want to invest 
overseas, the public feels that a large amount of foreign 
currency is going to flow out of our country. Economic 
bureaucrats maintain that unless the exclusionist sentiment 
against foreign countries, the vague subconscious delusion of 
persecution against internationalization, and blind patriotism 
are corrected, legal and institutional improvements cannot be 
carried forward effectively. [passage omitted] 
  An Economic Planning Board official made this point: "Before 
stressing the need for pushing the internationalization of the 
bureaucracy, there must be a clearly defined concept of 
internationalization in the Administration." According to him, 
internationalization is constantly being discussed in the 
bureaucracy, but there is no clear guideline on how to carry it 
forward. 
  According to the same official, the internationalization of 
ministries should be pushed forward by fully reflecting public 
opinion and only after going through interagency consultations, 
but currently, the atmosphere is swayed by one word from the 
president. Faced with an internationalization motto 
unilaterally decided at the top and conveyed to the bottom, each 
ministry unfolds its own strategy without consultation with 
others. Many economic bureaucrats argue that this leads to 
confusion of policies and discord among ministries. [passage

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
strongly indicated Tuesday that the government will move to 
raise the consumption tax from the current 3 percent in the 
planned sweeping tax reform. 
  Hata told the budget committee of the House of 
Representatives that the tax burden should be spread thinly and 
shouldered by as many people as possible in order to secure 
fiscal resources in the face of the rapidly aging society. 
  He said the tax rate on consumption in Japan is the lowest 
among the 25 nations belonging to the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
  The remarks are the latest signal of the government's 
intention to boost the ratio of indirect tax in the taxation 
reform that the government has pledged to realize by the end of 
the year. 
  The draft bills for the reform are scheduled to be compiled 
by the end of June. 
  Hata also reiterated the next general election should be 
held 
under the new electoral system. 
  A government panel is drawing up a new electoral map in line 
with the political reform law passed in January, which 
stipulates the replacement of the current multiseat 
constituencies with a system of combined single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation. 
  Hata, who leads the first minority government in four 
decades, has repeatedly dismissed opposition calls for snap 
polls under the old system to restore stable government. 
  Over questions of the economic conditions, Yoshio Terasawa, 
Economic Planning Agency director general, said the nation's 
economy has yet to get back on a recovery path. 
  Terasawa, while pointing to some bright signs, said the 
economy is by and large in a slump, with capital investments, 
corporate earnings and the employment picture remaining weak. 
  Asked about his view on the political realignment, Hata said 
he is looking for a change to a bipolar political landscape with 
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and a counteralliance as the 
two major players. 
  He said the policy gap between the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan, SDPJ] and its partners 
in the ruling coalition under former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has narrowed through policy discussions. 
  With the LDP being one major power, it is hoped that the two 
leading players will control the political scene, Hata said. 
  The SDP walked out of the coalition after it was infuriated 
by the formation of a new Diet group by some coalition members 
without consulting the SDP.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa has handed prosecutors a document concerning the 
bribery case against former Construction Minister Kishiro 
Nakamura, sources close to the case said Monday [23 May]. 
  Miyazawa states in the document, which was submitted in 
response to questioning by prosecutors, that Shin Kanemaru, 
former vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
told him in February 1992 that some in the party were opposed to 
the filing of a bid-rigging allegation against the Saitama 
Doyo-Kai Association of contractors by the Fair Trade Commission 
[FTC]. 
  Nakamura was arrested in March and later indicted on a 
charge 
of accepting a bribe from one of the nation's top contractors, 
Kajima Corp., in January 1992 in exchange for helping to block a 
criminal allegation by the FTC. Kajima was the then leader of 
the 66-member Saitama Contractor Association. 
  Miyazawa also stated he met with Setsuo Umezawa, then 
chairman of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), immediately after 
he met with Kanemaru, they said. 
  Miyazawa was quoted as saying that although he remembered he 
had talked with Umezawa about the intraparty objection to the 
criminal accusation, he did not have a clear memory of whether 
or not he told Umezawa he learned of the objection from Kanemaru. 
  Nakamura allegedly urged Umezawa not to file the criminal 
accusation with prosecutors against the group over its illegal 
price fixing. 
  Miyazawa also said in the document that he told Umezawa that 
the FTC should deal with the case of Saitama Doyo-Kai on its 
own, since the FTC had jurisdiction over the matter, the sources 
said. 
  The FTC announced in may 1992 it would not file an 
accusation 
with public prosecutors, and instead ordered the 66 companies to 
stop bid rigging.

  [Text] Nagoya, May 23 KYODO -- House of Representatives 
member Tadao Otani on Monday [23 May] partly admitted in court 
to charges against him that he evaded income taxes, but refused 
comment on other allegations that he conspired with his 
supporters to evade taxes. 
  Otani, 58, admitted to the bulk of the charges in his first 
hearing at the Nagoya District Court that while he was in the 
prefectural assembly he falsified declarations on political 
funds, but maintained that any tax evasion on the part of his 
supporters was a separate matter. 
  He has refused to comment on whether or not his actions with 
a former secretary Susumu Ochiai, 51, who also faces charges in 
court, and his supporters constitute a conspiracy. 
  Otani served four terms in the prefectural assembly before 
leaving the LDP to join Shinseito, the core party of the 
governing coalition. He left Shinseito in January after 
admitting to most of the charges. 
  The prosecution alleged that Otani took advantage of a 
system 
under which persons giving a donation to a political group can 
reduce their tax payout by attaching a receipt from the group to 
their tax return. Prosecutors allege that some of the claims by 
his supporters of donations paid never existed. 
  The prosecution alleges that as a result of the false 
claims, 
Otani and 72 of his supporters received a total of some 56 
million yen in refunds as tax deductions. 
  In his statement at a press conference following the 
hearing, 
Otani apologized to his supporters, but distanced himself from 
the period when he was a prefectural assemblyman, saying that 
since entering the Diet he had assumed new responsibilities. 
  "I will decide how I will assume my responsibilities in the 
future, on the basis of the opinion around me and the judgment 
of the court," he said, in referring to questions on whether he 
would resign his Diet seat.

  [Text] Sapporo, May 23 KYODO -- Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro 
Yokomichi said Monday [23 May] he will not seek reelection next 
spring, prompting speculation that he may return to national 
politics as a prominent political figure. 
  It was the first time that the 53-year-old Yokomichi said 
publicly he will not run for a fourth, four-year Hokkaido 
governorship term, but he declined to answer whether he will 
later run for a House of Representatives election. 
  His decision was widely interpreted as the start of 
Yokomichi's campaign to return to the lower house and the launch 
of efforts to band "democratic liberal" forces together. 
  Yokomichi, a former lawyer, was elected four times to the 
lower house from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) beginning in 
1969. He successfully ran for Hokkaido governor in 1983 and was 
reelected twice. 
  Yokomichi told reporters at Hokkaido prefectural government 
headquarters that he has not decided what to do, when asked 
whether he will run for election to the lower house if it is 
dissolved in the near future. 
  His chief strategist, Tetsuro Kaneko, said Sunday night at a 
news conference in Tokyo that Yokomichi will formally announce a 
decision not to seek a new term as governor of Japan's 
northernmost main island. 
  The governor told Kaneko that "you can begin selecting a 
successor to me," Yokomichi said. 
  Kaneko is head of the Hokkaido chapter of the Japanese Trade 
Union Confederation (Rengo), Japan's largest labor organization 
with eight million members. Rengo is the principal support 
group for Yokomichi. 
  The governor said he is likely to officially announce his 
decision not to seek a new term when a Hokkaido Prefectural 
Assembly session is called in mid-June.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- More than half of the heads 
of local autonomies and economic organizations feel the 
government's comprehensive national development plan aimed at 
administrative decentralization has failed to accomplish its 
ultimate goal, a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE showed Monday [23 
May]. 
  The heads of 22 local governments and seven economic 
federations out of 23 autonomies and eight economic groups 
polled responded to the poll, which was conducted in late April. 
  The survey showed that 59 percent of those polled felt the 
goal of decentralizing the government has not been achieved 
totally or substantially. 
  They based their responses on the wide gap between Tokyo and 
local municipalities in such fields as population density, 
economies and information propagation. 
  About two-thirds of respondents said some achievements have 
been made in the four national development plans implemented 
since 1962. 
  An overwhelming majority of leaders of local autonomies 
called for the carrying out of another program to balance 
development of the domestic economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Rules on imports and 
distribution of lumber and construction materials as well as on 
land use should be eased to lower housing costs and promote 
effective use of land in large cities, a government panel 
suggested Monday [23 May]. 
  The recommendations were submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata by a special group on land and housing of the government's 
team, dubbed Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, which 
is chaired by Hata himself. The task force team was launched by 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The suggestions covered 40 points in five areas regarding 
housing and land use in Japan. The areas are reducing housing 
construction costs, easing rules on construction such as floor 
space of housing, increasing supply of housing land, reviewing 
restrictions on land and houses for lease, and rules on land 
deals. 
  The special group of six academics and business leaders like 
Shigeru Ito, professor at Keio University, particularly stressed 
that the government should ease regulations on imported lumber 
and housing materials. 
  For example, it said Japan should make freer lumber and 
housing materials imports, if those commodities meet industrial 
standards in original production countries. 
  On land use, it suggested promotion of better use of idle 
agricultural land in large cities. However, in order to avoid 
inadequate land development, uniform deregulation is not 
recommended, it added. 
  The suggestions will be examined by concerned authorities 
like the Construction Ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Ministry, and the government will include conclusions 
in its policy reform plan on external economic relations to be 
released at the end of June, government officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications is inviting thousands of Japanese companies 
to an interindustry meeting to look into possibilities 
surrounding the multimedia business, a ministry official said 
Monday [23 May]. 
  The get-together, scheduled for June 16 at a Tokyo hotel, 
aims to promote exchanges among companies in different 
industries on the multimedia business, the official said. 
  "The most important characteristic of multimedia is border 
crossing. Barriers between industries and those between 
broadcasting and telecommunications, or those between areas will 
be lowered or disappear," he said. 
  "Because of this, we need to right now promote exchanges 
among different industries," the official added. 
  The move comes amid a race that is heating up among 
government ministries to take the lead in administering and 
supervising multimedia. The ministries traditionally compete 
with each other for administrative authority. 
  The businesses invited include banks and wholesalers, which 
fall under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry and the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry respectively. 
  Multimedia, which came into the spotlight this year, 
combines 
telecommunications with broadcasting, allowing users to receive 
and send information whenever they want. 
  According to an estimate by the posts ministry, the 
multimedia market is projected to grow to 123 trillion yen by 
the year 2010. 
  But with the definition of multimedia still vague and too 
many related services involved in the concept, the ministry is 
receiving inquiries from many companies wondering what to do.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Twenty-two Japanese firms 
will launch a two-year feasibility study on merging cable 
television networks and telecommunication systems in preparation 
for the forthcoming multimedia era, officials of the organizing 
body said Monday [23 May]. 
  The organizer is the Cable TV Conference, formed by Japan's 
cable TV Industry Association. 
  Using cable TV networks, the organizer seeks to provide a 
wide range of services, starting with personal handyphone 
systems (PHS) initially, and gradually diversifying into 
personal computer communications and broadcast shopping 
information. 
  In the face of rapid technological shifts to multimedia 
communication, the 22 companies, mostly cable TV operators such 
as Tokyu Cable Television Co., and common carriers like DDI 
Corp., want to explore the many possibilities, the officials 
said. 
  The firms also include KDD, NEC Corp. and leading trading 
house Mitsui and Co., they said. 
  Japan's phone services industry is currently dominated by 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), but the project will 
create another large communications link in the near future, 
they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The value of office-computer 
shipments fell for the third year in a row in the business year 
ended March 31, dropping 17 percent from the previous year to 
508.2 billion yen, the Japan Electronic Industry Development 
Association said Monday [23 May]. 
  In volume, shipments also shrank for the third consecutive 
year, falling 16 percent to 140,254, it said. 
  Association officials said the prolonged recession made 
corporations refrain from investing in office-use computers. 
  Such companies tended to buy personal computers or 
workstations instead, they said. 
  The association said shipments of office computers declined 
for all levels, including small business computers costing less 
than 3 million yen and large machines with a price of 10 million 
yen or more. By industrial sector, shipments to the financial 
industry jumped 35 percent in value and 19 percent in the number 
of units. The steady rise was attributable to a massive order 
from an insurance company, the association said. 
  Shipments to the public sector rose 4 percent in volume, but 
those to all other sectors declined from a year earlier, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry plans 
to strengthen risk management measures for insurance businesses, 
with a key piece giving policyholders rights to file a suit 
against insurers even if the policyholder is alone, ministry 
sources said Monday [23 May]. 
  Under the current law, at least 3 percent of the 
policyholders have to unite to file a suit to check their 
insurer's management situation or possible illegal activities. 
  That requirement practically prohibits policyholders from 
seeking law protection, particularly if their insurance firms 
are large. 
  For example, in the case of Nippon Life Insurance Co., a 
policyholder would have to call and unite more than 450,000 
other policyholders to bring a suit. 
  According to the ministry sources, the other risk-managing 
measures include establishing a finance body to salvage any 
financially troubled insurers, and allowing issuance of 
corporate bonds to insurers as a means of new fund-raising 
channels. 
  Reorganizing insurance firms into a joint-stock corporation 
from the current mutual aid status is also being sought so to 
strengthen their management in the face of increasing 
competition, they said. 
  The measures are planned by the Insurance Council, an 
advisory panel to the finance minister, as part of regulation 
reforms ahead of foreign entry in Japan's life and nonlife 
insurance industries. 
  With the suggestions, the Finance Ministry is likely to put 
the new guidelines into effect in the spring of 1996, the 
sources added.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The Japanese manufacturers' 
trade terms index dipped 0.1 percentage point in April from 
March but remained 1.2 points higher than a year before, the 
Bank of Japan said Monday [23 May]. 
  The index of the scale of price changes passed on from raw 
materials to finished goods stood at 111.1 against a base of 100 
for 1985, the central bank said in a monthly report. 
  Input prices declined 0.2 percent in April from March and 
were 3.2 percent below a year before, while output prices fell 
0.3 percent and were down 2.1 percent from April 1993, it said. 
  The input price index was 82.2, with domestic prices dipping 
0.2 percent for the month and import prices down 1.8 percent. 
  The output index was 91.3, with domestic prices down 0.2 
percent and export prices 0.7 percent lower, the report said. 
  The trade terms index rose for seven of the report's 14 
industrial sectors, led by a 3.8 percentage point increase for 
oil and coal products, of which petroleum products were up 5.4 
points. 
  The report cited lower crude oil and other raw materials 
prices for the improvement. 
  The index declined for textiles, ceramics, metal products, 
electrical machinery, transportation machinery and precision 
machinery, with the report noting higher overseas market prices 
for cotton but falling export prices for machinery.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Commodity futures dealers 
have been illegally discounting commissions for large investors 
and foreigners, government sources said Monday [23 May]. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and 
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries found in a 
probe that dealers have discounted commissions for futures 
transactions of gold, Azuki beans and other commodities for the 
sake of specific investors in breach of the commodity exchange 
law, government sources said. 
  Officially, however, the ministries deny any such misconduct 
by the dealers, the sources said. The ministries will take no 
particular punitive actions against the dealers. 
  Under the law, the practice of commission discounting is 
banned and violators could face fines or other penalties, 
although no cases of violation have ever been reported. 
  Japan's relatively high commissions -- seven to eight times 
more for gold futures than on the New York market -- puts local 
dealers at a disadvantage in international competition. 
Therefore, it is widely seen as "common sense" among dealers to 
change commissions from customer to customer in order to survive. 
  "We cannot compete unless we discount (commissions)," an 
official with one firm said. 
  Responding to calls from Japanese traders, the government 
plans to partially liberalize the commissions in June. 
  The planned liberalization, however, will be limited to 
commissions for foreign investors and commodity funds apparently 
because sweeping deregulation would hurt smaller dealers, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan's economy is poised 
for recovery but prevailing downward indicators make continued 
caution necessary, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of 
Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday [24 May]. 
  "The time is ripe for the economy to recover, with personal 
consumption showing improvements," Fujii said in a speech read 
by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito at a meeting of the National 
Association of Shinkin Banks. 
  Mieno said, "The economy is showing signs of hitting bottom, 
with some indicators pointing to improvements in economic 
activities led by personal consumption." 
  The central bank chief also cited various factors that 
underscore the improvement of conditions over the same period 
last year when the economy fell off after showing signs of 
recovery. They included progressing inventory adjustments and 
corporate restructuring, the spreading effects of the latest 
fiscal and monetary measures and recovering overseas economies 
led by the United States. 
  Fujii also repeated his "confidence" that the record 15.25 
trillion yen stimulus package launched in February and the 
fiscal 1994 budget would "contribute greatly to putting the 
economy on a full-fledged recovery." But the two financial 
leaders noted that the economy also faces possible downward 
trends. 
  Fujii said, "the economy remains sluggish with tough 
situations prevailing in capital investment and labor." 
  Mieno said, "cautious watching is still necessary" to see if 
the recent improvements are sustainable enough to spread to the 
overall economy. 
  "We must also keep in mind that negative factors prevail," 
he 
said, citing continued volatile currency rates, "strong 
adjustment pressure" on labor, and time needed for balance-sheet 
adjustments by companies and financial institutions after the 
collapse of the "bubble" economy boom in the late 1980s. 
  Regarding exchange rates, the central bank chief said, 
"further careful watching is necessary," suggesting his 
unchanged stance of intervening in currency markets to stem 
excessive volatility. 
  Mieno called for continued positive efforts by banks to 
clear 
nonperforming loans, saying that liquidations are still 
"mid-way," although emergence of new bad loans is slowing down.

  [Text] Nagoya, May 23 KYODO -- A trade union formed by 
workers of Toyota Motor Corp. and affiliates proposed Monday [23 
May] that the consumption tax be raised to 5.0 percent from the 
present 3.0 percent in fiscal 1996 in exchange for efforts to 
bring down prices through deregulation. 
  The 276,000-member Federation of All Toyota Workers' Unions 
said it will distribute the proposal to legislators of ruling 
coalition parties and others, starting in early June. 
  The federation said the present tax system forces workers to 
carry a heavy tax burden because of high income tax rates. It 
said the unfair tax system should be corrected through 
continuous income tax cuts and a raise in the consumption tax to 
5.0 percent from fiscal 1996. The federation said an additional 
consumption tax hike would be necessary from the year 2000 in 
view of the fast growing population of the aged. It said 
consumer prices can be brought down by about 9.2 percent through 
abolition and relaxation of excessive regulations and price 
controls. The federation also called for an easing of 
regulations on regular safety inspections of vehicles.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- An advisory panel of JNR 
[Japanese National Railways] Settlement Corp. has come up with a 
proposal calling for priority on the sale and listing of West 
Japan Railway Co. (JR West) stock in fiscal 1994, officials said 
Monday [23 May]. The corporation is entrusted with liquidating 
a huge amount of debts accumulated by the defunct Japanese 
National Railways (JNR), which was privatized and split into 
seven passenger and cargo transport firms. 
  Following the formal recommendation by the advisory council 
early next month, the corporation will start preparations for 
the listing of JR West stock in February next year, the 
officials said. The Transport Ministry and the corporation 
planned to list stock of both JR West and Central Japan Railway 
Co. (JR Tokai) in fiscal 1994. 
  The council stressed the need to promote stock sales for JR 
companies by taking into account the stock market environment in 
order to liquidate long-term debts held by the corporation. The 
council put priority on the sale of JR West stock over JR Tokai 
in view of stiff competition faced by the company on the rail 
transport market. The council also recommended sales of an 
additional portion of 1.5 million shares of East Japan Railway 
Co. (JR East) held by the corporation. JR East was listed on 
the market last year.

  [Text] Osaka, May 23 KYODO -- The Kansai Economic 
Federation (Kankeiren) on Monday [23 May] appointed Tetsuro 
Kawakami as its chairman to succeed Osamu Uno, who is retiring. 
  The selection of Kawakami, chairman of Sumitomo Electric

is a business lobby representing Kansai-based firms. 
  Uno told a press conference after the meeting that the last 
days of his seven-year term were focused on pulling the economy 
out of the recession. 
  Kawakami chose as one of his priority projects during his 
term a grandiose scheme to build a commercial and residential 
town near the Kansai International Airport, slated to open in 
early September, as well as other projects designed to boost the 
status of Osaka as a key hub of Asia.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said Monday [23 May] Japan has 
responded "in a very positive way" to U.S. proposals for 
resuming stalled framework trade talks between the two countries. 
  "The Japanese responded to our Marrakech discussion in a 
very 
positive way," Kantor said. 
  Kantor was commenting on a proposal that he made to Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata when they met in Marrakech, Morocco, 
in April. Hata was then Japanese foreign minister. 
  Kantor's comment came as Japanese and U.S. officials met for 
the fourth day in Washington in a bid to find a mutually 
agreeable formula to break the three-month-old deadlock in the 
framework trade talks. 
  The talks are now at "a delicate stage," the top Japanese 
Government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, 
said in Tokyo earlier in the day. 
  A top official at the Japanese Foreign Ministry also 
suggested that the talks in Washington have moved into a 
critical stage, saying the two sides will see whether they can 
"make it or not" after Monday's session. 
  Japanese negotiators -- led by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sadayuki Hayashi and Vice Minister of International Trade and 
Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu -- headed for the apparent showdown 
on Monday after a top-level government strategy session in Tokyo. 
  Japanese officials said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata met with 
senior government officials Monday morning on the trade 
negotiations. 
  "We are vigorously trying to break an impasse in the 
negotiations," Kumagai told reporters in Tokyo following the 
Hata meeting. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa may visit the United 
States, depending on the outcome of Monday's talks, Vice Foreign 
Minister Kunihiko Saito said. 
  Monday's session came after the two sides met for one hour 
Saturday in what officials said was focused on "clarifications" 
on a Japanese position for resuming the trade negotiations under 
the framework agreement concluded last July. 
  The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access 
to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade 
surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected 
Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese 
imports. 
  Among the industry sectors covered under the framework 
accord 
are Japanese Government procurement of medical and 
telecommunications equipment, trade in autos and auto parts and 
the Japanese insurance market. 
  Japanese officials said Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior Finance 
Ministry official in charge of insurance negotiations, headed to 
Washington to help with the talks. 
  No high-ranking officials from the Finance Ministry have 
attended the talks so far.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States on Monday [23 May] hammered out a broad accord to resume 
the stalled negotiations on a new bilateral trade framework, 
Japanese sources said. 
  The sources said the results of the agreement, clinched 
after 
four days of negotiations, will be announced Tuesday morning. 
  The sources said the two sides agreed to spell out the goal 
of each of the four priority areas covered by the framework 
accord concluded in July last year. 
  Monday's agreement should allow the two countries to reopen 
the framework talks, which have been ruptured since February. 
  The sources said the broad accord would not include any 
reference to numerical targets or similar language that could be 
misunderstood as such. 
  Details of the agreement are expected to be finalized at a 
meeting to be held Monday night, the sources said. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton have said they are eager to find a common basis for 
resuming the framework talks before they meet at the Group of 
Seven summit in Naples in early July. 
  Senior Japanese and U.S. officials, who began their latest 
round of negotiations Thursday, met again Monday for four hours 
at the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) before 
breaking up for further consultations among themselves. 
  "The Japanese responded to our...(proposals) in a very 
positive way," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
Monday morning. 
  As the two sides broke up for consultations in the late 
afternoon, key members of Clinton's economic team were seen 
heading into the USTR building. 
  Among them were Robert Rubin, director of the National 
Economic Council, Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council 
of Economic Advisers, and Undersecretary of State for Economic 
Affairs Joan Spero. 
  U.S. officials said a news conference on the framework talks 
is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. 
  One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the 
primary cause for the three-month deadlock in the negotiations 
-- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure the 
progress in market access to Japan. 
  Japan has rejected U.S. demands for quantifiable "objective 
criteria," saying that they may turn into "numerical targets" 
for U.S. exports to Japan, which would be tantamount to managed 
trade. 
  Clinton has denied that is the U.S. intention, a point 
Kantor 
reiterated Monday. 
  "We have never asked for numerical targets. We have never 
asked for market share," Kantor said. "That is not part of the 
discussion." 
  Among the industry sectors covered under the framework 
accord 
are Japanese Government procurements of medical and 
telecommunications equipment.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Informal Japan-U.S. trade 
talks are progressing without any numerical targets being set, 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday. 
  "I've heard that the talks are proceeding gradually...and 
our 
basic stance on numerical targets remains unchanged," Fujii told 
a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  "We (Japan) can't accept anything that is clearly a 
numerical 
target," he added. 
  Japanese and U.S. officials are holding informal meetings in 
Washington since last week in a bid to reopen the "framework" 
talks which have been at a stalemate since February, when then 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. Bill Clinton [as 
received] failed to agree on "objective criteria." 
  Fujii declined to make any predictions or disclose details, 
saying "negotiations are still under way." 
  While acknowledging news reports that an agreement to reopen 
the frameworks talks is expected later in the day, Fujii said, 
"I want to watch for a little while." 
  But he noted that the informal talks are focused on the 
three 
priority areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance, and 
government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment. 
  On the insurance field, which is overseen by his ministry, 
Fujii suggested that Japan is not offering any new commitments. 
  "We want to reach an agreement within our voluntary 
measures," he said, referring to the March market-opening 
package, including further deregulatory steps and simpler 
licensing procedures.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- A breakthrough in deadlocked 
trade "framework" talks between Japan and the United States is 
looming large, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro 
Hata said Tuesday. 
  With time left for discussion running out, both parties have 
basically agreed to get the stalled talks on establishing a new 
framework for bilateral trade back on a track, Hata told a press 
conference. 
  Hata said Japanese and U.S. delegates at subcabinet-level 
talks in Washington are now working on the final wording of key 
points that have divided the two parties since the framework 
talks ruptured in February. 
  If the delegates reach specific accords on resuming the 
trade 
talks, that would lead to an early meeting of the leaders of the 
two countries for a final breakthrough in the negotiations, Hata 
said. 
  But Hata declined to speculate when issues hampering a 
restart of the trade talks will be cleared. He denied reports 
that it would be "in one or two days." 
  In Washington, the unofficial trade negotiations entered a 
fourth day, with the sticking point being how to define earlier 
agreed "objective criteria" as a way to gauge U.S. access to 
Japanese markets. 
  "We are working on final wording of such a term so that it 
can be defined in a mutually acceptable manner," Hata said. 
  The talks to establish a new bilateral trade framework broke 
down when Japan rejected a U.S. demand for using "numerical 
targets" as objective criteria during the February summit 
between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  In search of a breakthrough in the talks, Washington made 
three new proposals to Japan in April on three areas -- 
objective criteria, overall goals of the framework talks and 
macroeconomic policy measures. 
  Heading the Japanese team at the Washington talks are 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry 
minister for International affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy 
foreign minister for economic affairs. They are believed to 
have given Japan's reply to the three U.S. proposals.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States wound up four days of exploratory talks in the early 
hours of Tuesday and appeared to break a three-month deadlock 
over their bilateral trade framework. 
  While both Japanese and U.S. sources said negotiators have 
hammered out a compromise arrangement that would allow the two 
countries to resume the stalled framework talks, officials 
involved in the negotiations would not confirm a deal is in 
place. 
  "There will be a statement tomorrow," said Bowman Cutter, 
deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, 
after emerging from the negotiating session which ran past 
midnight. 
  Cutter declined to make any further comments, refusing even 
to confirm that the four days of closed door negotiations are 
over. 
  Japanese negotiators were equally reticent. 
  Asked whether the four days of talks have been wrapped up, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi responded, "I wish so." 
  At stake is the fate of the so-called "framework" accord, a 
set of formal market-opening negotiations the two countries 
launched last July but which collapsed in February at a 
Washington meeting between President Bill Clinton and then 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Shortly after Japan's new premier, Tsutomu Hata, came to 
office in late April, he and Clinton agreed to seek a common 
basis for resuming the trade talks before they meet at the Group 
of Seven summit in Naples in early July. 
  The key points of the settlement on Monday, according to 
Japanese sources, included a U.S. commitment not to use 
numerical targets as "objective criteria" in measuring progress 
of imports to Japan. 
  Another U.S. commitment, the sources said, is to refrain 
from 
using trade sanctions as a means of enforcing 
"objective-criteria" yardsticks to be set in each of the 
industry sectors covered by the framework agreement. 
  Japanese sources said the two sides also agreed to continue 
informal talks to work out the objective criteria to be used for 
the "priority" industry areas under the framework -- Japanese 
Government procurement of medical and telecommunications 
equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business. 
  In what could be a source of future disputes, the U.S. 
side of the negotiating table appeared to emphasize that the 
settlement clinched Monday embodies the "results-oriented" trade 
policy championed by the Clinton administration. 
  According to U.S. press reports, the deal includes a formal 
acceptance by the Japanese Government that "measurable results" 
will be a gauge for measuring whether the Japanese market is 
really open to foreign nations. 
  In return, the United States will assure Japan in writing 
that it will not rely solely on "numerical targets" to determine 
progress on trade issues, THE WASHINGTON POST reported in early 
editions Tuesday. 
  At the heart of the controversy, as both Japanese and U.S. 
officials have freely admitted, is "a lack of trust" between the 
two countries when it comes to bilateral trade issues. 
  Japan is committed under the framework accord to 
significantly reduce its global trade surplus by boosting 
domestic demand and opening its market wider to U.S. and other 
foreign goods. 
  Yet, the Japanese surplus has kept on snowballing, hitting a 
record 130 billion dollars last year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Tuesday the United States is not likely to demand that 
Tokyo set numerical targets to measure progress in opening 
Japanese markets as means of rectifying the chronic bilateral 
trade imbalance. 
  Hata, answering questions at the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee, said Japan and the U.S. have deepened mutual 
understanding through a series of recent contacts on the issue. 
  The premier said vice ministerial-level negotiations in 
Washington on resumption of a new bilateral trade framework have 
neared conclusion, although he has not received a report on the 
results. 
  Japan cannot accept such numerical targets, Hata said, "and 
I 
expect it (the outcome of the negotiations) is not likely to 
have such things." 
  Tokyo has rejected a U.S. demand to introduce such targets, 
which led to a collapse in February's bilateral summit. 
  According to Japanese officials, Japan and the United States 
late Monday resumed long-stalled talks on a new trade framework 
following an agreement that was clinched after four days of 
tough negotiations. 
  They said the results of the agreement will be announced 
Tuesday night Japan time, but they did not provide other details. 
  Hata reiterated that Japan must make efforts to further open 
its market on its own initiative, through deregulation and 
clarifying procedures to access the market.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Simultaneous implementation 
of a hike in the consumption tax and an income tax cut would 
have an adverse impact on private consumption, Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [24 May]. 
  If the government were to implement a consumption tax hike 
and income tax cut "without a time differential, it would only 
discourage consumption," Hata told the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee. 
  "It is utterly unthinkable to implement a tax hike alone 
from 
now on," Hata said in response to a query from Japanese 
Communist Party interpellator Kazuo Shii, who pressed Hata to 
clarify whether the government will hike the consumption tax. 
  The tax rate is currently 3 percent. 
  Hata hinted that the government will implement another tax 
cut in advance of a consumption tax hike, saying that a time lag 
between the two "is conceivable." 
  "The ratio of consumption-related taxes to total state 
revenue (in Japan) is the lowest among the (24) member states of 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," he 
said. The Japanese ratio stands at 19.2 percent, as against the 
OECD average of 40.3 percent. 
  Japan "would not be able to cope with the needs of the aging 
society" unless as many people as possible shoulder the 
financial cost of welfare outlays on a broad basis, he said. 
  After the first coalition government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa fell in April, the coalition parties launched 
a second coalition by inking a common policy document on April 
22, including a controversial accord to boost state revenues 
with a hike in indirect taxes. 
  Asked whether Japan could implement concerted sanctions with 
the United States if China vetoed a possible U.N. Security 
Council resolution to punish North Korea for its suspected 
nuclear arms program, Hata hinted at his readiness to take such 
concerted action. 
  "I understand Japan can take action even outside the 
framework of the United Nations" under the coalition's common 
policy document, he said. 
  Hata was responding to Shii's query on whether a phrase in 
the coalition's common policy document implies that Japan may 
take concerted sanctions with the United States, if the Security 
Council failed to come up with a sanction resolution. 
  The phrase on Japan's policy on the Korean peninsula says, 
"the government will deal with a contingency in close 
cooperation and solidarity with the U.S. and South Korea, while 
preparing for such a contingency under the Constitution." 
  However, Hata renewed a pledge to place Japan's concerted 
actions with the U.S. within the boundaries of the Constitution. 
  The Constitution's Article 9 bans the use of military means 
to solve international conflicts. 
  On Japan-U.S. Trade ties, Hata said Japan will not be forced 
to accept a possible U.S. demand to set numerical targets to 
whittle down Japan's lopsided trade imbalance with the United 
States. 
  He suggested he would remain adamant in turning down any 
demand related to numerical targets, as any talk of a target 
figure could be unexpectedly interpreted by the U.S. side as a 
commitment. 
  "A figure tends to go alone by itself," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan, Australia and the 
United States have forged bilateral accords on milk products in 
the face of liberalization next year, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported 
Tuesday [24 May]. 
  The leading Japanese daily on its front page said Japan in 
secret bilateral negotiations with Washington in late March 
pledged to import 20,000 to 30,000 tons of milk products 
annually for use in bread and confectioneries through a 
semigovernment channel. 
  The paper reported that the bilateral accord with Australia 
was reached last year. 
  But the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
denied the allegation. "These measures are not a 
country-by-country accord, being prohibited by GATT," the daily 
quoted a ministry official as saying. 
  Japan will liberalize imports of milk products in 1995 with 
a 
minimum foreign access level of 137,202 tons annually under the 
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). 
  The amount, which is imported on low tariffs, is allocated 
to 
the Livestock Industry Promotion Corp. The other importers will 
be permitted to buy the foreign farm products at high tariffs. 
  The semigovernment body also promised Australia that it will 
buy three-quarters of Japan's total imports of the allocated 
skim milk and butter annually, according to the daily.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan's farm minister denied 
a news report Tuesday that the government has reached secret 
bilateral accords with Australia and the United States to import 
certain amounts of milk products. 
  The report, published in the Japanese daily ASAHI SHIMBUN, 
said the accords were reached in the face of import 
liberalization for the products next year. 
  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato 
told reporters that Japan is holding negotiations with the U.S. 
and Australia to guarantee the 1986-1988 level of butter, skim 
milk and other milk product imports. 
  The talks under way do not concern country-by-country 
accords, which are prohibited by the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kato said. 
  He added that Japan, which is holding the negotiations under 
GATT rules, has no secret deals and has offered no guarantees on 
milk product imports. 
  Kato said that Japan will inform GATT of the results of the 
negotiations when they are completed.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- Japanese political 
leader Masayoshi Takemura met U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Perry and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili 
at the Pentagon on Monday [23 May]. 
  An aide to Takemura, leader of new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger], later told reporters that Perry showed strong 
interest on the current state of Japanese politics and asked 
Takemura for his views on its impact on Japan's foreign policy. 
  New party Sakigake is a splinter group of the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Takemura served as 
chief cabinet secretary of the previous government of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Takemura, whose party quit the ruling coalition last month, 
assured Perry that Japan will stick by its close relationship 
with the United States under the present government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata or any future "post-Hata" government. 
  Takemura also told Perry that "there is no doubt" that Japan 
will play its part in implementing any sanctions the United 
Nations may impose on North Korea in connection with its 
suspected nuclear arms development. 
  Takemura is currently on a private visit to the U.S. 
  He is expected to meet other senior U.S. Government 
officials 
before leaving for San Francisco to give an address, the aide 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Saudi Arabia on Monday [23 
May] urged Japan to make efforts to break a deadlock in a joint 
project to refine Saudi crude oil in this country, a Japanese 
Trade Ministry official said. 
  Saudi Arabia made the request when its Petroleum and Mineral 
Resources Minister Hisham Muhyi-al-Din Nazir met with Japanese 
International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata in Tokyo, 
the official told a press conference. 
  The joint project calls for building or acquiring three 
refineries in Japan to refine 450,000 barrels of Saudi Crude oil 
per day for sale in the Japanese market. The project has been 
on hold since last November, however, due to a policy rift 
between Nippon Oil Co. and Japan Energy Corp., both major 
Japanese partners in the scheme. 
  During the half-hour meeting with Hata, Nazir voiced hope 
that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
will play a role of "catalyzer" in resuming the project, 
according to the MITI official. 
  If crude oil exporters like Saudi Arabia can ensure "secured 
markets" for their crude supplies, it would benefit Japan as 
well as the exporters by helping prevent rapid fluctuations in 
crude prices, Nazir said. 
  Saudi Arabia is prepared to continue talks on the scheme, 
Nazir was quoted as saying. 
  Hata replied the stalled project is basically a matter for 
the private sector but his ministry will do its utmost by 
upgrading related business conditions for an early resumption of 
the scheme, the MITI official said. 
  The Japanese trade minister asked Saudi Arabia to make a 
decision on extending oil-exploring concessions currently given 
to Japan's Arabian Oil Co. beyond the scheduled expiration in 
2000, although Nazir did not make a specific commitment, the 
MITI official said. 
  Arabian Oil has been operating in Saudi Arabia for 30 years 
as a core oil supplier for Japan, Hata noted. 
  On a Japanese request for Saudi Arabia to ensure a stable 
crude oil supply to Japan, Nazir said, "that is no problem." 
  "Saudi will continue to be a constant crude supplier for 
Japan," Nazir said. 
  Nazir arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a seven-day visit to 
Japan. 
  On Tuesday, he is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. 
  During his meeting with the prime minister, Nazir will hand 
over to him a personal message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, 
which is believed to contain the Saudi Arabian request on the 
joint refinery project.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- NEC Corp. said Monday [23 
May] it has signed an agreement with the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences [CAS] to jointly set up a computer software company in 
Beijing. NEC-CAS Software Laboratories Co. will be established 
June 15, with capital of about 150 million yen, NEC said. 
  NEC will hold 90 percent of the shares, while the rest will

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Monday [23 May] spurned an opposition demand to disband his 
minority cabinet upon parliamentary passage of the fiscal 1994 
state budget. 
  "There should not be a standoff between the ruling coalition 
and the opposition camp," Hata told the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee. He added that his administration, "is 
sincerely seeking to implement the common policy agreement." 
  The premier was responding to a query by Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [SDPJ] legislator Shun Oide. 
  The SDP, which was the No. 1 component of the previous 
cabinet led by Morihiro Hosokawa, stormed out of the coalition 
late last month in protest against the abrupt formation of a 
large parliamentary group excluding the SDP. The SDP's move 
forced Hata to form Japan's first minority government in 39 
years. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo demanded Saturday that the 
Hata Cabinet should resign en masse after the fiscal 1994 budget 
bills are approved by the Diet, and before the opposition camp 
submits a motion of no-confidence. 
  Kubo also hinted that the SDP, which holds the deciding vote 
in the Diet, may move to make a reconciliation with its former 
coalition partners if Hata bows out. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Sunday there is no 
difference of opinion between him and Kubo. Murayama said a 
dissolution of the lower house for a snap general election might 
be inevitable in the event of political turmoil. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, said Monday he agrees with the SDP on the 
issue. 
  Oide urged Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to withdraw his 
recently published comments that Japan needs to apply a more 
flexible interpretation to the Constitution in order to defend 
itself in the face of a "possible threat from North Korea's 
missiles and the buildup of China's naval forces." 
  Oide took issue with a statement of Kakizawa's published in 
a 
book that carried proposals from 200 intellectuals and 
politicians. 
  Kakizawa rejected Oide's demand to renege his conviction 
about Japan's defense policy, while promising to live up to the 
Hata administration's vow not to amend interpretation of the 
Constitution. 
  Hata rejected Oide's demand that Kakizawa be dismissed as 
foreign minister to take account for his remark. 
  Hata renewed a pledge Monday to seek the passage of the 
overdue fiscal 1994 state budget by the end of the current Diet 
session as discussions on the budget finally started. 
  Hata said,"I really hope the budget passes in the current 
Diet session by any means. I will make most sincere efforts for 
that." The Diet session is scheduled to end June 29. 
  "I feel great responsibility. I regret the delay," Hata 
said. Nearly 80 days have passed since the government submitted 
the budget to the Diet for deliberations. 
  He was responding to questions by an LDP legislator Takashi 
Fukaya. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai denied he is seeking 
an extension of the term of the current Diet session to ensure 
the passage of the budget. 
  Hata declined to talk about an extension of the Diet 
session, 
saying it is a matter that should be decided by the Diet. 
  Kumagai also promised a formal report on the recent "sexist" 
remarks by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito and top 
policy strategist in the ruling coalition. 
  Kumagai said he will directly ask Ozawa what he really meant 
by the remarks and will brief the committee session. 
  He was referring to Ozawa's remarks last month which 
defended 
the move among some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc 
without the SDP. 
  Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an 
extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters, "it 
doesn't matter which women you may sleep with." 
  Kumagai said the remarks are "not appropriate if they were 
really made."

  [Correspondent] So, if the roundtable fails, will the

  [Hun Sen] I do not know [words indistinct]. I do not know 
whether the Khmer Rouge will agree to it or not or whether they 
will continue to fight. But the Khmer Rouge said they will come 
to the roundtable. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct]. 
  [Hun Sen] Even if there were no Khmer Rouge, we still need 
foreign aid to strengthen the capability of our armed forces.

  [Text] On 17 May 1994, his majesty the king once again 
called for a roundtable meeting without preconditions to be held 
at the Chhanghsu-on Royal Palace in Pyongyang, DPRK. His 
Excellency Khieu Samphan and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK] totally support the royal appeal with a view to achieving 
national reconciliation and peace, thereby quickly ending the 
Vietnamese war of aggression. With this objective, the PDK has 
organized a delegation to attend the roundtable meeting without 
any preconditions. 
  Nonetheless, the two-headed government, Princeling 
Ranariddh, 
and the puppet Hun Sen, while claiming to support the meeting 
without preconditions, have created stumbling blocks to sabotage 
the parley. For instance, on 20 May 1994 the prince and the 
puppet made a blatant statement imposing certain conditions, 
especially a cease-fire prior to the meeting. At the behest of 
the communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance, the two 
puppets have repeated that a cease-fire is a precondition. The 
following is our answer: 
  1. The two heads and their bosses want to fool the national 
and international community into believing they really want 
peace and national reconciliation. In reality, they are fanning 
the flames of war. 
  2. The goal of the Vietnamese and the Western alliance is to 
make the roundtable meeting fail, thus delaying it. This would 
allow them to retreat, reorganize their military forces, and 
wait for the military aid they are busy seeking for the two 
puppets' forces. These forces are on the brink of collapse 
because of a lack of combat troops. They are retreating and 
regrouping their forces by drafting people to serve as 
militiamen and reserve troops they call local self-defense 
units. This is a maneuver to force people to serve as soldiers 
and fight while at the same time inflaming the war. 
  3. Princeling Ranariddh and the puppet Hun Sen have 
vociferously asked for military aid for the sole purpose of 
further fomenting the war and killing their fellow countrymen. 
The communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance have ordered 
them to do this. They do not want to see national 
reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. 
  This is the true nature and the root cause of the ongoing 
war 
triggered by the communist Vietnamese and the alliance, who are 
the ringleaders. The persistence of the communist Vietnamese 
and the alliance in continuing the war clearly shows that the 
roundtable will be sabotaged by every means. The communist 
Vietnamese and the alliance and their two puppets intend to use 
the roundtable while they retreat and reorganize their forces to 
further attack the people and Democratic Kampuchea. 
  The nation, people, and Democratic Kampuchea can see through 
the scheme of the two-headed clique and its bosses. They are 
determined to join hands more closely and continue their 
struggle against these schemes. We want to achieve national 
reconciliation and genuine peace, thereby allowing the people to 
live peacefully, work on their farm land, and earn a living.

  [Text] The king once said that foreign military aid might 
be the only measure to end the ongoing conflict between the 
Royal Government and the Khmer Rouge. 
  This statement triggered strong reaction from the alarmed 
Thai prime minister and members of the Royal Thai Government to 
the point that they called on the ASEAN countries to lobby 
against military aid from Western countries to Phnom Penh. 
However, many politicians condemn such a response from Thailand 
and regard it as an act of interference in internal affairs of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  Political analysts on Cambodia revealed that Thailand does 
not want war in Cambodia to end because the fighting in Cambodia 
has all along enabled Thailand to reap massive profits from 
Cambodia's wealth, especially from the rich forests and gems 
along the border. 
  The analysts added that no country has the right to prohibit 
Cambodia from getting foreign military aid for strengthening her 
army. Cambodia has the right to receive the assistance and is 
able to prove to Thailand how to end the war through military 
means. 
  Is it now not the time for all of us, Cambodians, to wake up 
to face reality and stop quarrelling? Are there still Cambodian 
politicians who agree with such an assumption of the Thai side?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Truth and a Major Problem"] </F>
  [Text] It is reported that the Vietnamese people and 
government have made a strong demand to force residents and 
foreigners in Vietnam to live in special concentration zones. 
This is aimed at ensuring the safety of those people and that 
of the Vietnamese inhabitants as well. 
  The report also indicates that foreigners have been deceived 
bitterly by local people while the former, in turn, have created 
no less multitudinous insecurity and anarchy among the 
Vietnamese people and government. 
  In Cambodia, residents and foreigners, especially the 
Vietnamese and Thais, are in a similar situation and are even 
more powerful than those in Vietnam. They are living in an 
uncontrolled manner and have created indecency throughout the 
country. They are currently polluting the environment along 
rivers and in villages; destroying fine ancient traditions; 
causing insecurity in society; and committing thievery, robbery, 
dupery, prostitution, obscenity, vices, and so on. As for the 
Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, it has lately striven to 
produce an immigration law with the aim of taking different 
measures to restore social order. 
  Some local political analysts have expressed the belief that 
the political situation in Cambodia will ease to some extent if 
the government strives to codify the immigration law quickly and 
if the National Assembly speedily adopts it. Owing to the lack 
of a law, it is hard to organize these foreign residents in an 
orderly fashion. The delay in the promulgation of the law has 
been severely criticized. 
  It is also known that an anti-Vietnamese demonstration 
recently was deterred. Analysts are of the opinion that there 
will be obstacles in the implementation of the law as the 
problem of Vietnamese in Cambodia is complicated and also has 
political implications. 
  It is expected that there will be some reaction from the 
Vietnamese Government after the immigration law is enacted and 
after its enforcement. It, however, is hoped that the 
settlement of the issue of foreign residents in Cambodia will 
help ease some of the problems surrounding the issue of a 
roundtable meeting between the government and the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Sensitive to the fact that rural 
development will be the key to winning the continuing long-term 
battle against the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge and their 
supporters, the Royal Government has allocated a large chunk of 
its national budget towards this end. 
  The Royal Government's plans for rural development involve 
programmes wider than technical advances in agriculture alone. 
  The five principal ministries and secretariats are currently 
involved in rural development and are collectively allocated 
some 25 percent of the national budget. 
  Several contributing countries and agencies are also 
involved 
in rural development activities of various kinds, together with 
over 100 non-governmental organisations. 
  "There are some 17 priority areas that are seen as being 
critical to rural development and the Royal Government attaches 
great importance to pursuing a coordinated programme approach to 
rural development and to making a major thrust towards bringing 
development to the more remote areas. The priority areas are in 
providing adequate training and training centres, documentation 
centres and workshops and the providing of adequate water supply 
for drinking, domestic use and irrigation," the report on 
National Programme to Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia which 
was made available to THE CAMBODIA TIMES, said. 
  In addition to this, it also intends to continue the 
repatriation programme with emphasis being placed on integration 
and employment and continuing with, if funds permit, 
accelerating the mine awareness and clearance campaigns. 
  Other aspects of rural development include the 
implementation 
of a new integrated Family Food Production Programme for food 
security, repairing, rehabilitating and constructing rural 
roads, providing primary health care and fostering an expansion 
in rural credit. 
  "The government also intends to establish Community and 
Women's Development Centres and provide informal training in 
addition to establishing small enterprises and income generating 
activities. It also plans to establish model villages, develop 
alternative energy sources and protect the environment and 
natural resources and encourage reforestation," the report said. 
  To address these interconnected priorities, the Royal 
Government will pursue two parallel strategies. 
  Firstly, it is seeking to improve the management of rural 
development programmes, primarily by supporting greater 
consultation and better coordination among the development 
partners. 
  The principal objective is to strengthen the planning and 
delivery capacities and mechanisms of various agencies and 
organisations working in rural parts of the country which should 
be made effective in the short-term. 
  Secondly, the government is seeking to improve and to 
increase the linkages between the design and implementation of 
development programmes, mainly by promoting participatory 
methodologies and an integrated approach to rural development. 
  To pursue these strategies and its many programmes 
successfully, the government has identified two key policies to 
accelerate rural development. 
  The second is to ensure a shift towards an integrated and 
more people orientated approach to rural development in order to 
reinforce sustainability through people participation and gender 
sensitivity. 
  The report said that people's participation is crucial to 
the 
success of any rural initiative. In addition, rural development 
strategies must build people's confidence and expose them to new 
ideas and approaches consistent with a more open society, so 
that their participation becomes even more meaningful.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's speech at the 27th </F>
general meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Kuala 
Lumpur; date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: First, I would like to 
express my sincere thanks to His Excellency Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad, a very close friend of mine and the Pacific 
Basin Economic Cooperation Council [PBEC], for having provided 
me with the opportunity to attend this important forum and 
exchange views with all of you who have contributed to the 
dynamic economic growth in the Pacific region. 
  We Vietnamese often liken our country to a balcony that 
faces 
the Pacific Ocean and enjoys the fresh air and also bears the 
brunt of all the storms from the sea. Therefore, we attach 
great importance to all developments in the Pacific Basin. 
  Speaking of the Pacific Basin, especially the eastern rim, 
people think not only of devastating earthquakes and storms but 
also of protracted and fierce wars that lead to consequences 
that were far more serious than natural disasters and that set 
up barriers among regional countries. 
  Over the past centuries, many nations in the eastern rim of 
the Pacific Basin were colonial or semicolonial countries and 
served as suppliers of raw materials and labor to metropolitan 
countries. Meanwhile, except for Japan, the economies of the 
aforementioned nations were seriously affected by slow 
development and backwardness. The situation has basically 
changed now. All of those nations have regained independence, 
and wars have ended. Confrontation has been eliminated, and the 
trend for peace and cooperation has been established and 
developed with each passing day. People are surprised at and 
admire the marvelous economic achievements of many countries in 
this region where repeated waves of development have given birth 
to many rising dragons that are making their presence felt 
strongly in the world market, thus heralding the start of the 
Pacific era. 
  The role of the Pacific region in the world economy has been 
consolidated with each passsing day, and as His Excellency Prime 
Minister Mahathir predicted at last year's conference in Seoul, 
by the year 2020, the Pacific economies will be 2.5 times 
greater than that of Western Europe, provided that the Pacific 
Basin countries do not shoot themselves in the foot. 
  The dynamic development of the Pacific economies has not 
only 
brought about well-being for the regional people but also 
created favorable opportunities for the business circle all over 
the world. With a population of billions, East Asia and 
Southeast Asia form a large market and a big source of labor. 
Especially, the people in the region have a tradition of 
diligence, education, and skill. Many regional countries have a 
substantial need for capital, technology, and management 
experiences and as such, create a booming market for investment 
and trade. 
  Located at the intersection of the world's busiest sea and 
air transportation networks and due to their development needs, 
regional countries give top priority to infrastructure 
development. This move creates no insignificant investment and 
business opportunities. Furthermore, the abundance of rich 
natural resources in the region is also an important factor for 
development and business attractiveness. The social and 
political stability in each country and the trend for peace and 
cooperation in the region created a reliable environment for 
business. The trend for regionalization in combination with 
that for globalization is developing, including Malaysia's 
initiative on the East Asia Economic Cooperation Forum. This 
has further strengthened the business opportunities in the 
Pacific. It is our hope and belief that this trend would not 
lead to confrontation between the economic blocs and closed 
trade, but step up the broadening of regionalization through 
efforts to further explore the agenda of discussions of the 
previous conference, thus contributing to increasing business 
opportunities to a significant degree. 
  The vitality of the Pacific region, therefore, is creating 
important opportunities that should not be missed. The Pacific 
Basin, however, is very large and not a homogeneous entity. The 
countries in the region are at different economic development 
levels and sociopolitical structures. They experience different 
historical circumstances and cultural traditions. Besides, 
there are still latent sources of possible significant 
confrontation in the region. Though peace and cooperation for 
the sake of development is becoming the prevalent trend, the 
region has not been perfectly peaceful at all times and in all 
places. Moreover, while cooperation is often coupled with 
competition, the only way to suppress any possibility of 
confrontation is dialogue for the sake of enhancing mutual 
understanding and trust, thus further developing cooperation 
both inside and out of the region for peace, stability, and 
prosperity of the region and each of the countries. 
  The undeniable conditions to ensure the basic interests are 
mutual respect, understanding of one's national self esteem and 
cultural traditions, avoidance of coercive imposition, and 
politicalization and ideologicalization of trade ties and 
cooperation. In other words, the principle of diversity in 
unity will help us reduce confrontation and increase 
opportunity. I strongly trust that dynamic development coupled 
with sincere cooperation among the countries, politicians, and 
businessmen will open promising potential for prosperity for us. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, like other countries in the region, 
our 
country also has favorable geographic location, diversified 
natural resources, and especially the industrious, curious, and 
skillful people who can adjust quickly to the new environment. 
Recognizing the opportunity and challenge facing the developing 
countries including Vietnam, we have been persistent in the past 
several years in our renovation policy, in the development of 
the market-oriented economy, and the expansion of international 
cooperation. Achievements reached during the renovation process 
help us to gradually settle our economic development and to 
create new opportunity for domestic and foreign businessmen. 
The Vietnamese economy nowadays is developing, inflation has 
been repressed, export and foreign investment are on the rise at 
fast speed. The sociopolitical stability further improves the 
favorable environment for foreign and domestic investors. 
  We are ushering our country into a new development stage in 
which we will gradually practice industrialization and 
modernization. We have great demand in industrial capital and 
business and management expertise. This is a new opportunity 
for foreign investors and businessmen. 
  It is true that the infrastructure of Vietnam is still 
inadequate. It is quite understandable in the case of a 
backward agriculture country that had been seriously devastated 
by long wars. We are concentrating our energy to resolve the 
situation by reserving most of development aid for construction 
and upgrading public roads, ports, airports, and power and water 
supply networks. Many opportunities are widely open for 
businessmen to participate in the development process in such 
forms like bidding, joining investment capital, including the 
formula of construct-operate- transfer. 
  It is also true that our legal system is imperfect. It still 
allows annoying procedures. We are well aware of this weakness 
and are trying to overcome it. We also trust that the 
international cooperation will help us with valuable experiences 
and opportunities to train our staff and improve our management 
style. 
  One great favorable element for both us and foreign 
businessmen is that Vietnam's foreign relations are expanding 
quickly. Nowadays Vietnam has fine relations with all 
neighboring countries, is actively preparing to join ASEAN with 
full membership, and is participating in other institutions in 
the Asia Pacific region. 
  Vietnam has established normal cooperative relationship with 
international organizations, improved its relations with most 
Asian, European, Middle East, African, and American countries. 
A vivid example of cooperation opportunity with Vietnam is the 
developing relations between Malaysia and Vietnam. The fine 
relations reflect not only the warm and trustful atmosphere 
between the leaders and peoples of the two countries, but also 
the ever-increasing cooperative relations on culture, economy, 
science, and technology. The Vietnamese-Malaysian cooperation is 
an indication of the South- South cooperation and the regional 
cooperation developing in Southeast Asia. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the new vitality of the Vietnam's 
economy is encouraged by the vitality of the Pacific region and 
by the open door policy of diversification and multidirection 
that Vietnam has been pursuing persistently. I am delighted at 
the knowledge of future visits to Vietnam of many distinguished 
guests who are present here today. The door to Vietnam is 
always open wide to welcome you. You will have a chance to know 
the traditional hospitability of Vietnamese people and witness 
potential of our country and business opportunities that will 
bring benefit for both sides. 
  I thank you and wish you a successful conference.

  [Text] Penang, May 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Asia Pacific 
region will be able to prosper by putting aside differences 
which obstruct progress and bringing together commonalities 
which enhance harmony, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah 
Badawi said. If Malaysia, with its plural society, could 
succeed in forging [word indistinct] situations among its 
people, there was hope that the Asia Pacific region, with its 
diverse states and communities, would also be able to succeed, 
he added. 
  Countries in the Asia Pacific region should never allow 
Western nations to use the issue of human rights, democracy and 
economic development as a cudgel to ensure conformity with the 
new world order in the Western image, he said when opening a 
conference here Sunday. 
  The five-day conference on Conflict Resolution in the Asian 
Pacific region: Culture, Problem-Solving and Peacemaking, 
organised by the Malaysian Science University, is being attended 
by about 120 scholars, policy-makers and practitioners from 278 
countries in the Asia Pacific region. 
  It is time that countries in the Asia Pacific region let no 
one doubt that our future would be shaped by us and not others, 
as sovereign nations, we must construct our own agenda for our 
future and not allow it to be dictated by others, Abdullah said. 
  The Asia Pacific region was in a comfortable position to 
pursue its own strategic goals that would neatly fit its 
distinctive cultures, histories, circumstances and national 
requirements, he said. 
  In this context, he added, the least Asian countries were 
[word indistinct] positioned to work out and solve their 
problems relating to nuclear proliferation. 
  As an example, he said North and South Korea, together with 
China and Japan, could negotiate [words indistinct] in efforts 
to resolve the current issue between North and South Korea. 
  Abdullah said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) member countries were already on their way towards 
framing their own security agenda under the ASEAN Regional Forum 
(ARF). 
  ASEAN could set not only the manner but also the pace with 
which it would deal with peacemaking mechanisms and the 
avoidance of conflict situations by relying on its own 
experience and cultural tradition. 
  The first ARF meeting in (?Bangkok) in July would test its 
relevance and usefulness, he said. He also hoped for greater 
openness and readiness by the West to understand and appreciate 
Eastern perspectives as the East had done on many international 
issues. 
  Differences between Western and Eastern perspectives are in 
fact reconciliable for as long as their ultimate objective 
remains one of mutual respect and justice. Where there is 
neither respect nor justice, there could be no peace and 
violence would ensue, he said.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 24 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Indonesia's 
diplomacy in facing the Asia-Pacific conference on East Timor 
(APCET) has been successful and a 90-percent victory has been 
achieved, Ambassador Lopes Da Cruz said in Jakarta Tuesday 
night. As an example of the effectiveness of Indonesian 
diplomacy, he pointed to the cancellation of attendance of the 
French and Portuguese first ladies who were originally scheduled 
to deliver a keynote address at APCET in Manila, May 30-June 2. 
  "With the cancellation of the attendance of the two first 
ladies, we have won 60 percent," said Da Cruz, who has just 
arrived back from West Europe where he joined a religious 
occasion. 
  Furthermore, with Philippine President Fidel Ramos banning 
foreign participants from taking part in the conference, 
Indonesia has achieved a 90-percent victory against its 
adversaries, namely those who were against the integration of 
East Timor into the Indonesian territory. 
  "Let us consider the remaining 10 percent is a `present' to 
them," he said with a broad laugh. 
  Lopes Da Cruz, who knew a lot about Ramos Horta, the chief 
adversary against the integration, said further that actually 
all the international activities with regard to East Timor were 
merely Horta's means of collecting money. 
  "He has nothing to do, and it is only from the seminars on 
East Timor which he made a project that he could survive," he 
said. Da Cruz also said that Ramos Horta was very shrewd. He 
now turned to Asia for his East Timor seminars after failing to 
turn the issue of East Timor into an international topic in 
Europe. Da Cruz concluded that now Indonesia has the upper hand 
in dealing with APCET.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (YONHAP) -- South Korea cautiously 
asked Indonesia Monday to persuade the Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) to take a balanced view of South and North Korea, 
especially in the nuclear dispute, as NAM foreign ministers 
prepare to meet in Cairo next week. 
  Visiting Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, meeting his 
counterpart Ali Alatas in morning talks, explained North Korea's 
obligation to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections, South Korean officials said. 
  Indonesia chairs the Non-Aligned Movement and is the subject 
of heavy diplomatic lobbying by North Korea, which keeps its 
third largest mission here with a staff of 25 to serve as a base 
camp for Southeast Asia. 
  NAM foreign ministers meet on May 31 in Cairo, with the 
North 
Korean nuclear problem on the agenda for the first time for 
inclusion in the ministerial statement due at the meeting. 
  Han requested Indonesian support for South Korea's first bid 
for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 1996-97, 
the officials said. Their discussions included an exchange of 
views on overall revisions to the security council makeup, they 
said. 
  The two foreign ministers also swapped views on the upcoming 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November, to 
be hosted by Indonesia. 
  South Korean officials expect a major difference from last 
year's APEC summit in Seattle, Washington, which was mostly 
dominated by the United States and other advanced countries. 
  This year, the home advantage and participation of Malaysian 
Premier Mohamad Mahathir are likely to change the tone and 
direction in favor of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), according to the officials. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam plans to attend the APEC 
summit. 
  The foreign ministers touched base on bilateral trade 
issues, 
expressing satisfaction at the steady increase in volume and at 
active investment by the South Korean side. 
  Two-way trade is predicted to reach 5.1 billion U.S. dollars 
this year with Seoul actually ending up about 500 million 
dollars in the red. 
  Han asked for Jakarta's cooperation in ensuring a steady 
supply of petroleum and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South 
Korea, the officials said. 
  South Korea imports most of its LNG from Indonesia. This 
year, 3.7 million tons of LNG out of the expected 4.7 million 
tons in demand should come from Indonesia. 
  The South Korean foreign minister winds up his visit to 
Indonesia on Tuesday after paying a courtesy call on President 
Suharto.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 24 (OANA/ANTARA) -- The Governments of 
Indonesia and Czech signed here Monday a new trade agreement in 
an effort to boost bilateral trade ties. 
  Czech Minister for Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy in a 
press conference after signing the agreement with his 
counterpart, Indonesian Minister for Trade S.B. Judono, said 
that the two countries' business circles are expected to realize 
the trade agreement. 
  Previous trade agreement between Indonesia and 
Czechoslovakia, signed in 1975, terminated when Czechoslavakia 
was split into two countries, Czech and Slovakia, on January 1, 
1993. 
  According to Dlouhy, Czech offers ample and good 
opportunities for Indonesian businessmen to increase exports to 
the East european countries because Czech is now an open market 
with a favourable macro-economic condition. 
  He also said that Czech businessmen are interested to form 
partnership with their Indonesian counterparts in manufacturing 
Tata truck engines, which have been exported to Egypt, Turkey, 
China and North Korea. Besides, he went on, Czech automotive 
industry is also interested to export Skoda cars to Indonesia. 
  Czech businessmen are also interested to be involved in the 
construction of a toll road betleen Cikampek and Padalarang in 
West Java, he added. 
  In the meantime, Judono said that Czech is indeed a 
potential 
market for Indonesia's commodities and that it is the right 
gateway for Indonesian commodities to enter the eastern and 
central European markets. He also appealed to Indonesian 
businessmen to make harder efforts so as to gain access to the 
Czech market, especially in view of a trade deficit of 4 million 
U.S. dollars recorded in 1993 in favour of Indonesia. 
  Indonesia usually imports from Czech among other things

  [Text] The Lao Ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak, 
denied reports of an imminent cabinet reshuffle in his country, 
and insisted any change was still a long time off. 
  "Normally a change could be expected every five years, at 
the 
party congress," Bounkeut said. He said the next party congress 
would be held in two years. During the Fifth Lao People's 
Revolutionary Party Congress in 1991, party Secretary-General 
Kaysone Phomvihan became president of Laos and Khamthai 
Siphandon replaced him as prime minister. The ambassador denied 
an earlier report that a large-scale change was expected soon in 
the cabinet, saying the report was inaccurate. "The change will 
not come so soon," he said. 
  The report said six cabinet posts -- four economic and two 
security affairs -- would be affected by the change. There has 
been frequent speculation about changes in Laos since the death 
of President Kaysone in November, 1992. After his death, there 
was one minor cabinet reshuffle in which Somsavat Lengsavat 
became foreign minister to replace Phoun Sipaseut.

due to the upcoming conference on East Timor is still not over. 
A high-level meeting between Filipino and Indonesian officials 
was canceled earlier today. President Fidel Ramos was scheduled 
to meet Indonesian Industry Minister Tunki Ariwibowo and the 
Indonesian ambassador. However, the Indonesian Embassy revealed 
that Minister Ariwibowo is still in the United States, and the 
meeting was rescheduled. 
  Meanwhile, Malacanang [presidential office] officials 
admitted that the incident has something to do with the East

  [Text] Twelve more foreigners were banned from entering the 
country to take part in human rights conference on East Timor. 
This brings to 20 the number of foreigners banned from the East 
Timor meeting. East Timor resistance leader Jose Ramos Horta 
was among those who were earlier banned from entering the 
Philippines. 
  Meanwhile, Senate President Edgardo Angara is supporting the 
move to ban the participation of foreigners in the conference. 
For his part, Senator Arturo Tolentino expressed concern over 
the ban. He says the move reflects a weakness in the country's 
foreign policy.

  [Text] The New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger, has 
denied dodging human rights issues in talks with Indonesia's 
President Suharto. He says he clearly voiced his concerns about 
the situation in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor 
during a visit to Jakarta last week. 
  New Zealand's opposition Labor Party has condemned 
conciliatory remarks made by Mr. Bolger after his meeting with 
Mr. Suharto, branding him an apologist for Indonesia. But Mr. 
Bolger said he discussed the situation in East Timor at length 
with the Indonesian leader. He said he conveyed the substance 
of a petition signed by 51 of New Zealand's 99 members of 
parliament protesting against human rights abuses in the 
territory. Mr. Bolger said the suggestion that the warmth of 
his welcome in Indonesia stopped him from talking about the 
issue is simply wrong.

<F P=106> [By Michael Field] </F>
  [Text] WELLINGTON, May 24 (AFP) -- New Zealand will send 
250 infantry soldiers to join the United Nations protection 
force in former Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Jim Bolger announced 
Tuesday. The force, which will be attached to a British 
company, amounts to around 10 percent of New Zealand combat 
ready troops and is the country's biggest military commitment 
since the Vietnam War. 
  "This is not a decision the government has reached lightly, 
but I firmly believe it is the right decision," Bolger told 
parliament in announcing New Zealand's first contribution to the 
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. 
  The prime minister said New Zealand had special 
responsibilities as a current member of the Security Council and 
as a founding member of the United Nations. He said the New 
Zealanders would face danger. "The nature of the conflicts and 
the tasks undertaken by UNPROFOR make this unavoidable." Bolger 
added: "Peacekeeping is no soft option in defence terms," he 
said. 
  "We will take every care to minimize the risk to our 
personnel, but the element of risk cannot be totally removed." 
  The force is to have six weeks training immediately in New 
Zealand and would then leave for two weeks training in Britain 
before deployment in Bosnia. An attempt to hold a parliamentary 
debate on the contribution was frustrated when the leader of the 
small opposition New Zealand First Party, Winston Peters, 
objected. The main opposition Labour Party said they supported 
the contribution. 
  "This is not New Zealand going to fight a European war, it 
is 
a New Zealand contribution to maintaining peace," opposition 
leader Helen Clark said. 
  "The government considers it important that New Zealand as a 
small member state, strongly committed to the founding 
principles of the United Nations, plays its part to the greatest 
extent possible of supporting and implementing the decisions of 
the UN Security Council," the prime minister told MPs. He said 
the size of the contribution was determined in order to meet 
UNPROFOR requirements and to be as self-sufficient as possible. 
  "It would enjoy a distinctive national identity yet be 
readily integrated into the larger British unit," Bolger said. 
"Satisfactory arrangements can be established to ensure that New 
Zealand would retain full control of the New Zealand contingent 
while operationally attached to a British battalion." Thirty 
six other nations also contribute to UNPROFOR.

  [Excerpt] During a 24 May session of the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee, Kazuo Shii of the Japan 
Communist Party said that the United Nations will not adopt a 
resolution slapping economic sanctions on the DPRK for its 
suspected development of nuclear weapons. He then asked Prime 
Minister Hata how Japan will deal with economic sanctions if the 
United States and other nations impose them on North Korea. In 
response, Prime Minister Hata stated: "If the United States and 
other nations impose economic sanctions on the DPRK, Japan would 
prepare for a state of emergency in accordance with the 
Constitution. The economic sanctions imposed by the United 
States and other nations are different from those slapped on by 
the United Nations." In this way, the prime minister indicated 
that Japan can take concerted action with the United States and 
South Korea against North Korea. 
  During the session, however, Prime Minister Hata refused to 
state specifically how Japan will deal with the economic 
sanctions, saying: "Inspectors from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency are now checking nuclear facilities in North 
Korea, and it is a very delicate time. I therefore wish to 
refrain from discussing at this session how Japan should deal 
with the economic sanctions." [passage omitted on questions and 
answers on public services fees at the session]

  [Text] Private-sector representatives recently submitted a 
package of proposals to the government calling for deregulation 
of 71 items to open Japanese markets wider. But it was only two 
items for which relevant government offices decided to "take 
action" for deregulation. 
  This was disclosed in a report compiled by a working group 
of 
the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters [ARPH] (headed 
by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) for the government, which is 
currently engaged in the task of compiling a package of 
deregulation measures before the end of June. The group 
gathered opinions of ministries and agencies concerned on the 
private sector's deregulation package and included them in the 
report. 
  At a meeting with Prime Minister Hata on 13 May, Keidanren 
[Federation of Economic Organizations] Vice Chairman Isao 
Nakauchi (chairman of supermarket giant Daiei) strongly demanded 
promotion of deregulation. He is an influential member of the 
ARPH's "import promotion, improvement of market access, and 
distribution" working group. It seems that behind his strong 
demand lies the apathy of government offices to deregulation. 
His demand also suggests bureaucrats' strong resistance to 
deregulation. 
  The report compiled by the working group summarizes opinions 
of relevant ministries and agencies on the private sector's 
package of proposals for deregulation of 71 items. In the 
report, these items are classified into three groups -- one for 
which "actions will be taken in line with proposals," one for 
which "taking action will be considered," and the other for 
which "no action will be taken because the proposals are based 
on misunderstandings." 
  Of the 71 items, only two fall into the first group. They 
are "shortening the term for granting a license for food 
businesses" and "easing regulations on foreign capital inflow 
into the first-class telecommunications business." Twenty-nine 
items, including "simplifying procedures for obtaining a license 
for dealing in antiques," fall into the second group; 25 items, 
including "allowing the establishment of holding companies" and 
"introducing a self-service system in service stations," are in 
the third group. Another 15 items are considered a group for 
which "actions have already been taken." 
  At a meeting on 12 May, working group experts, including 
Nakauchi, severely criticized response of the government offices 
to the proposals. On 18 May, Nakauchi submitted a letter to 
government offices complaining against their reluctance to 
deregulation. In the letter, he said: "Although deregulation 
is urged by the people and other countries, government offices' 
attitude of trying to protect their authority remains unchanged. 
This is very regrettable."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Too Many Regulations Block the Way Toward </F>
Realization of High Information System"] 
  [Text] The mood toward building a base for the 
next-generation information and communications infrastructure is 
growing. The Telecommunications Council, an advisory panel to 
the posts and telecommunications minister, has also recently 
come up with a report recommending construction -- in three 
stages -- of a optic fibre network, which by 2010, will become 
the mainframe of the information and communications 
infrastructure. 
  Completion of an information and communications 
infrastructure will bring forth tremendous economic and social 
effects. 
  First, it will become an incubator for the next general 
industry. There is no telling what kind of new industries will 
emerge when the existing industries of telephone, broadcasting, 
cable television (CATV), computer, movie, video, electric power, 
and city gas infuse with information and communications 
technologies. On the multimedia-related market alone, the 
council predicts the size of it to grow to 123 trillion yen, 
providing 2.43 million new jobs by 2010. Naturally, the industry 
will also become a base for technological reform. 
  Second, the information and communications infrastructure 
can 
be used in medical, educational, and administrative services to 
improve living conditions and peoples' welfare. It can be 
expected to play the role of a social infrastructure that will 
support industrial development and improve living standards. 
<H5>  Regulatory "Infrastructure" </H5>
  Despite this bright picture of the future, we become shocked 
when we see the walls of regulations blocking its arrival. The 
condition is so bad that networks of the regulations have become 
an infrastructure of their own. As long as they stand 
unabolished, there will be no way for the information and 
communications infrastructure to be built up. Nor will there be 
a multimedia market or new information society because they can 
only develop when there is an infrastructure. 
  Let us cite some specific examples. 
  First, if a company wants to start a telecommunications 
business by laying a communications system, or wants to withdraw 
from its business, it has to have a permit from the posts and 
telecommunications minister. But what if one might like to be 
entrepreneurial and start a new service at his own risk. The 
one who makes decisions on whether or not there is a demand for 
such a service is the government. The government nips the new 
businesses in the bud. 
  It is indeed difficult to believe that bureaucrats have 
capabilities to predict what demand there will be for which 
service areas. The success of a service business depends on 
ideas. The process of supervisory government offices reviewing 
business plans, taking as much as they like in doing so, results 
in compromising creative ideas, and only discourages the 
entrepreneur's desire to create new businesses. 
  The authorities' rationale is that this area of business 
belongs to one which commands high public interests, and thus, 
if companies are allowed to come and go as they please, it will 
not serve the people's interests. We are not saying we cannot 
understand that rationale, but we must note that this kind of 
justification has been too easily used to hide the fact that it 
has restrained competition. 
  Suppose a permit was issued to a company for startup and the 
company was ready to go into business. There are other binding 
and fettering regulations waiting for it. 
  "What are all these charts with drawings like spider webs?" 
When engineers from a U.S. CATV company arrive at a Japanese 
company to provide technological assistance, they all ask this 
question in amazement upon being shown project prospectus papers 
that cover the whole process leading up to the beginning of 
construction of a CATV network. 
  In the United States, when a local government decides to 
approve installation of CATV networks in a certain area, 
businesses can start construction of networks right away without 
any government office's approval. In Tokyo, on the other hand, 
CATV companies that want to open interactive V service stations 
by the end of this year need to wait for half year to file an 
approval on its construction plan, and then wait about a year to 
receive an approval. Only then can it start the actual 
construction work. 
  That company needs to explain specific details of its 
business plan to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 
It must then go through a process of obtaining a myriad of 
permits and approvals before actually being able to lay its 
circuits. It has to obtain approvals for all construction 
details -- use of roads and utility poles, crossing of railways, 
and construction of networks beneath roads. Drawings must be 
prepared on all individual work sites as well. 
  Take roads for example. Because some roads belong to the 
central government, some to prefectural governments, and some to 
city governments, the company has to contact concerned offices 
and police stations of the central and appropriate local 
governments regarding the use of them. Even when the company 
comes up with a most efficient CATV circuit layout plan through 
the use of computers, the plan will become useless if even one 
government office says it cannot approve the crossing of roads 
at certain points. The company has to find different routes to 
make the necessary crossings and come up with a new layout plan. 
The company will have to receive approvals on tens and hundreds 
of utility poles -- at the huge cost of people's time and energy 
and the work of copy machines. It is only natural that 
companies insist approvals should be at least be given on the 
basis of certain blocks. 
  Public utility utilization charges imposed on the use of 
roads and utility poles are bound to be higher than those 
imposed on uses of such facilities as electric power, city gas, 
piped water, and sewage systems, and are heavy burdens on the 
CATV image-transmitting service whose facilities have a 
relatively short life to begin with. Let us suppose a new 
communications or CATV business has somehow managed to install 
hardware. What is awaiting it now are more regulations, this 
time, dealing with the substance of the services it wants to 
provide. 
<H5>  "Halt" to Service </H5>
  A typical case is medical service. Remotely conducted 
diagnosis by using an information network is technically 
possible, and much expectations are given to it at present. But 
according to the Law on Medical Practice, diagnosis made based 
on remotely provided information is not recognized as an act of 
diagnosis. As such, physicians cannot add diagnosis charges to 
their services; therefore, remotely conducted medical service 
will not make headway in this country. Even when diagnostic 
records are computerized on floppy disks for instance, under 
law, the medical cards need to be maintained anyway. 
  Reservation of [train, bus, and airline] seats and the 
issuance of tickets can be considered as readily workable cases 
wherein benefits of the information network can be conveniently 
used to make people's lives easier. But even when people have 
computer terminals at home, they cannot have access to travel 
companies' systems. That makes it impossible for these people 
to make reservations or do anything at all. Even convenience 
stores, as they are not registered as travel agents, cannot 
provide reservations services. Furthermore, as far as the 
matter of issuing tickets is concerned, only offices with proper 
registration and with people in charge of ticketing are allowed 
to engage in such business services. Suppose reservations are 
made by phone or other means. The only way for the would-be 
travelers to get the tickets is for them to go to the 
ticket-issuing offices or to have them mailed. There is no way 
to get the tickets issued by a system like automatic vending 
machines. 
  The government is set to complete the outline of external 
economic measures and intends to make deregulation a major part 
of it. Meanwhile, Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] and other private-sector organizations are 
calling for actions on this situation, citing existing 
regulations in the information area. If government offices are 
only concerned about which offices should take control of what 
interests, doing nothing about the substance of deregulation, 
not only will relations with the United States be jeopardized, 
but also the future of Japan itself. With eyes set on the 
future new information society, the regulations which no longer 
fit reality or which are too vague to define should be revised 
and changed at their foundations.

  [Text] It has been learned that the Construction Ministry 
and the construction industry have asked the Fair Trade 
Commission [FTC] to drastically revise its draft "guideline on 
public bidding," which aims at regulating business operations to 
discourage bid-rigging. 
  In a position paper presented to the FTC, the Construction 
Ministry and others strongly urged that voluntary agreements to 
refrain from dumping, and free sales activities with 
organizations placing construction work orders be permitted. 
Apparently, the construction sector is seriously concerned that 
the industry as a whole may face common ruin with the expected 
intensified competition for orders and greater transparency in 
the bidding system, while the ministry for its part is strongly 
disinclined to lose its connections with the industry. 
  The guideline on public bidding is to replace the guideline 
for the construction industry formulated in 1984. It lists 
practices violating the Antimonopoly Law and those permitted 
under this law. The old 1984 guideline was rendered powerless 
under the pressure of the construction industry and 
construction-zoku Diet members [Diet members lobbying for the 
construction industry], and it has been criticized by the United 
States for "abetting bid-rigging." 
  A new guideline is to be decided on this summer, and the FTC 
last month solicited position papers from the construction 
industry, academicians, and the concerned government ministries 
and agencies. 
  The Construction Ministry's position paper, the contents of 
which have been disclosed, consists of six sections. Apart from 
voluntary agreements to refrain from contracting for orders at a 
low price -- for fear of extensive cut-price competition -- and 
free sales activities with the contracting parties, the document 
also asks that the following be allowed: 1) legitimate 
information-gathering for participation in bids; and 2) an 
exchange of information indispensable for forming joint ventures 
(JV). 
  Voluntary agreements to refrain from taking orders at a low 
price are permitted under the old guideline, but the FTC has 
deleted this from the new draft in the belief that "this may be 
taken as condoning prior agreements on prices." The 
Construction Ministry wants this to be retained in the new 
guideline, saying "taking orders at a low price will result in 
the harassment of subcontractors and a deterioration of working 
conditions." 
  In the construction industry, there has been a frequent 
acceptance of orders at a price substantially lower than the 
estimated price (upper limit of the contracting price) after the 
experimental implementation and actual introduction of open 
public bidding. The industry wants to avoid a general price 
decline. It has presented similar demands to the Japan 
Federation of Construction Contractors [Nikkenren] and the 
Associated General Constructors of Japan [Zenken]. 
  Furthermore, the draft new guideline also stipulates that 
the 
construction firms can only express their intention to 
participate in bids and to provide technical information if 
there is a request from the contracting party to supply 
information. The Construction Ministry complains that "this is 
inappropriate because it restricts the contracting party's 
opportunity to obtain useful information on technological trends 
and other matters." 
  The ministry denies that it is applying any "pressure" by 
presenting the aforementioned demands and says, "What we are 
saying is merely to make the contents of the guideline more 
lenient." On the other hand, the FTC says, "We do not see any 
need to change our view."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bureaucrats, Stay Away From Politics; Perform </F>
Role as Think Tanks"; part one of two-part editorial entitled 
"Let Us Think About Politics and Governance at This Time of 
Transition"] 
  [Text] It was the day the Hata cabinet set sail. Newly 
named cabinet ministers came into the news conference room next 
to the Prime Minister's Residence, one after another. Some were 
shy and flushed, stammering: "this came so suddenly... I would 
like to begin learning," and some simply read statements written 
by government officials who anticipated certain questions. 
  Moriyoshi Sato of Shinseito, who was named director general 
of the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development 
Agency, is a veteran politician elected to the Diet for the 
ninth time, but was one of those who simply read the written 
response provided. A reporter chided him, saying: "I thought 
it was the policy of the new cabinet to lead the government on 
its own; is reading something written by bureaucrats not 
synonymous with being led by bureaucrats?" Sato was unable to 
reply immediately, and finally said, "I read them (the written 
answers) because they were similar to my own thoughts." 
  The relationship between "our ministers" and the bureaucrats 
is one of give and take. The bureaucrats among themselves look 
down on the politicians, but at least superficially handle them 
in a courteous manner, calling them "ministers -- our 
ministers," and are also quick to turn them into government 
office spokesmen. The cabinet ministers who are not equipped 
with specialists' knowledge and thus are afraid they will 
stumble when answering questions in the Diet have no choice but 
to rely on the bureaucrats to help them. 
<H5>  "Bureaucrats Standing Above Politicians" Under the Coalition </H5>
Government 
  Even after the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] government, 
which lasted nearly 40 years, stepped down and the coalition 
government took the LDP's place, the relationship between 
politicians and the administration as symbolized in the 
expression "our ministers" has not changed. It appears that the 
self-conceited thinking of the bureaucrats that they are the 
ones who really run the government is in fact more pronounced 
than before. The chaotic conditions and insecurity that come 
with the coalition government are now here, without doubt. 
Expressed another way, it may be that the bureaucrats are 
feeling they are performing services [for the country] in a 
difficult time. 
  But even though the bureaucrats may be enjoying the 
coalition 
era of "the bureaucrats standing above politicians," they are 
perplexed as well. However strong they relive that they are the 
ones who are running the government, the persons who make final 
decisions on policy matters are politicians. As long as 
policymaking is accompanied by the need to appropriate budget 
funds -- which means a that bills need to be passed by the Diet 
-- the bureaucrats have no choice but to depend on the political 
world, which lies beyond their ability to control. 
  To do their work and to keep themselves secure, the 
bureaucrats are keen to know where real political power resides. 
During the latter part of the LDP's long rule, the bureaucrats 
made daily visits to members of the Tanaka faction, the LDP's 
largest faction, and thereafter to the power brokers -- men like 
Takeshita, Kanemaru, and Ozawa. Government policies were made 
through the group efforts of the government offices concerned 
and the bosses of the zoku-giin [Dietmen representing government 
and business interests]. 
  In order to be accepted by the power brokers and the 
zoku-giin, the bureaucrats made subsidies available on a 
priority basis and assigned public works projects as the former 
desired. The bureaucrats introduced them to the businesses and 
the business organizations which could become sources of funds. 
In fact, the bureaucrats even bought the politicians' party 
tickets and provided vote-collecting services. 
  Such actions were possible only because the government 
offices had the rights to issue licenses and permits and to 
exercise administrative guidance. In other words, this simply 
meant that the bureaucrats used administrative authority--which 
is supposed to be exercised in the public interest--in the 
interests of the ministries to which they belong or even for the 
purpose of protecting and promoting the interests of individual 
bureaucrats themselves. 
  Thus was born the collusive structure of politicians, 
bureaucrats, and businessmen collaborating with each other in 
appropriating whatever they want--the root cause of political 
corruption. In this process, bureaucrats play a central role. 
  When the LDP's rule ended, we thought a big crack opened 
in the iron triangle of the alliance of politicians, 
bureaucrats, and businessmen. Initially, the bureaucrats and 
the industries seemed baffled by the collapse of the powerful 
ruling party and the fluid political environment. But once 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] took over the leadership of the 
coalition of so many family members, the bureaucrats lost no 
time in meeting with the Shinseito politicians. In the 
beginning, according to a bureaucrat of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, "we met with them secretly, as 
we were conscious of the eyes of the LDP people." Now there is 
no need even for that. 
<H5>  `New' Zoku-Giin and Single-Seat District System </H5>
  In fact, there has been no change at all. All that happened 
was that the party to be dealt with changed from the LDP to 
Shinseito. The habits of clinging to those in power remain the 
same. Shinseito played an active role as a link between 
industries and government offices when the 1994 budget was 
formulated. The party now has departments in charge of 
individual government offices and councils for review of 
individual issues. It has parliamentary unions through which to 
exercise influence on government offices and industries. 
Indeed, these people are nothing but new zoku-giin. 
  The political reorganization strategy of Shinseito Secretary 
General Ozawa, who in fact owns that party, lies in collecting a 
new conservative force to replace the LDP and adopting the 
single-seat district system, while scheming to agitate and split 
up the LDP and the SDPJ at every available opportunity. 
Shinseito, which is an offspring of the old Tanaka faction of 
the LDP, understands well how to collect votes and tap sources 
of funds through the government offices. In preparation for the 
House of Councillors election next year--as well as for a 
possible general election, the likelihood of which is increasing 
due to rising tensions in the political circles--the party has 
started to actively work with government offices and industries. 
  The adoption of the single-seat district system in the House 
of Representatives election means that the political parties 
will become central bases for political activity hereafter. The 
system of single-seat districts will help create a ruling party 
which holds a majority in Parliament, in turn helping to form a 
strong government. Suppose that the bureaucracy ties up with a 
political party in which all political power is concentrated. 
An omnipotent political regime [yokusan taisei] will then 
emerge. 
  Under the single-seat district system which will force 
political parties to fight on a one-to-one basis, there is no 
other choice but for bureaucratic circles, business circles, and 
local people of influence to take sides with certain parties. 
Shinseito is hinting at an idea of sending party officials into 
central government offices (by using the parliamentary minister 
system). The United States changes all of its the 
senior-ranking officials when a new president comes to power, 
but Japan is different from the United States. As such, it is 
doubtful whether such a system will work and can take root in 
Japan. But there is no denying that the single-seat district 
system will bring about major changes in the ways politicians 
and bureaucrats think and act. 
  Now that we are in a period of political transition, people 
are once again thinking about how the nation should be governed 
and administered. The government needs to return to the 
original starting point of being the servant of the people of 
the nation and to distance itself to a certain degree from 
political affairs. In order for the politicians to make 
informed decisions and exercise leadership in stabilizing and 
improving people's lives however, they may need to use the data 
and expertise of bureaucratic organizations. What the 
bureaucratic organizations should do is to act as good advisors 
to politicians and act as think tanks for them -- for instance, 
presenting alternatives when making suggestions for political 
consideration. By all means, it is the politicians' 
responsibility to decide on the policies of the country and on 
the courses the country should take.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Administrative `By-Pass' Will Be a Way Out of </F>
the `Impotent Votes'" Problem; part two of two-part editorial 
entitled "Let Us Think About Politics and Governance at This 
Time of Transition"] 
  [Text] Public distrust in politics can be called public 
distrust in policies. Politicians and bureaucrats are not fully 
aware of this. 
  The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has been trying to revive the 
idea of raising the consumption tax rate after its idea of 
instituting the national welfare tax was scrapped. Has the 
ministry even once asked the general public about what they were 
thinking in regards to such an idea? Nor will the public 
distrust of this out-of-the-blue idea of a "7-percent rate" [for 
the consumption tax] dissolve just because the government Tax 
Commission has started to review the matter. Everybody knows 
that the Tax Commission, as all commissions are, is only a 
puppet. 
  The MOF went out all out to work on Diet members of the 
ruling and opposition parties. They "sought understanding" from 
influential businessmen as well. When told that raising public 
utilities charges would offset the effect of the [income] tax 
reductions, Tadashi Ogawa, director of the MOF Tax Bureau, 
countered: "All you have to do is not ride taxis anymore." 
  We were shocked by such dogmatism. Can they not see anything 
beyond political interests? 
  Let us view politicians and the administration as 
"intelligence models." Both politicians and the administration 
are media that reflect the public will on policy matters -- the 
politicians do so through elections and the administration 
through services they provide. 
<H5>  Gap That Comes by Adopting a Party-Oriented System </H5>
  The parliamentary democracy system cannot but be an 
incomplete system. That is because it cannot reflect promptly 
enough the needs of the constantly changing economic society. 
If the single-seat district system becomes a reality, there 
will be many more impotent votes [shihyo--votes for the losing 
candidate] than before, thus further widening the gap [between 
the parliament's actions and actual needs]. 
  In a two-party system, the parties need to present all of 
their policies -- ranging from those concerning welfare to 
national security -- in one package. The voters have no choice 
but to choose from the given packages, and are given no chance 
to vote on individual policy issues, such as the consumption 
tax. But in a complicated and fast-changing economic society, 
it is close to impossible to simply say yes or no to policy 
packages presented by political parties. The party-oriented 
system can catch the public will only in "rough image scanning 
lines," and frustrations from "impotent votes" are bound to 
develop. 
  Underneath the existing mood of political distrust 
represented in the existence of so many parties are the 
politicians' lack of ability to formulate policies, the 
structural problem of the politicians scrounging for interests, 
and the disappointment of the voters, who voted for major 
parties, about becoming "impotent votes." 
  On the other hand, the administration does not have 
organizations to absorb private-sector needs other than 
bureaucrat-elected review councils and public hearings. The 
inevitable consequence of such a closed system is that the 
bureaucrats get themselves deeply involved in politics by 
manipulating to get their own views adopted [by the review 
councils and public hearings]. 
  Last fall, General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito 
[Japan 
Renewal Party] came up with a concept of inaugurating 
parliamentary deputy minister posts. No doubt, the situation of 
the politicians' failing to do their homework and having to 
depend on parliamentary specialists to answer questions in the 
Diet is regrettable. On the other hand, Ozawa's concept will 
enable the politicians to get too close to more political 
interests, while failing to offer any way of minimizing the 
"impotent votes" issue. It would be too simple-minded if one 
believed a large number of politicians -- just because they are 
armed with petitions from their constituencies -- represent the 
public will in reality. 
  An alternative to that is to create a by-pass that can 
minimize the "impotent votes" issue not on the political side 
but on the administrative side. 
  Since the existing Constitution allows national referendums 
to be conducted only on a Constitutional amendment and on 
national review of the Supreme Court; it does not allow the 
referendum to be conducted on individual policy matters, it will 
not be easy to expect the legislature to go all out for a 
national referendum on policy matters. 
  But we must recall that, testifying before the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee on 3 February 1978, Sanada, 
then Cabinet Legislation Bureau director, said: "I do no think 
instituting a system whereby the Diet can conduct national 
referendums to determine the general will of the people on 
individual matters and to use it in reference to the Diet's 
deliberations on bills would constitute a violation of the 
Constitution." 
  (Then) Prime Minister Fukuda, who spoke after him, then 
stated: "Public opinion surveys conducted under Diet initiative 
can be useful." We can find a model for the by-pass in this 
statement. 
  The "green papers" system that made its debut in the United 
Kingdom in 1967 is worth considering as well. The UK House of 
Representatives proceedings define the green papers as "written 
government documents concerning proposals to be presented to the 
people of the nation in quest of discussions -- except the 
matters of policy already decided on." 
  In the UK, the government policy outlines are presented to 
Parliament in the form of white papers, and legislative bills 
are formulated based on these white papers. But when the 
bureaucrats decide it is necessary to ask for views of the 
public, green papers are prepared and issued as reference 
materials before formulation of the white papers. The people 
who prepare the green papers are groups of officials concerned 
from ministries and agencies. Hundreds of organizations 
concerned, intellectuals, and the general public are asked to 
comment on the green papers, and then the green papers' contents 
are revised to reflect these views. Once that is done, the 
contents are incorporated into the white papers. 
  It will not be easy for Japan to jump to the green papers 
system that was born in the custom law system of the UK. But 
Japan should accept and adopt the function of the green papers, 
which is aimed at having the public will absorbed in new 
policies of the matters that have much to do with the people's 
lives -- for instance, those on welfare and tax. 
  Some people are cautious about the national referendum 
system. They assert it is "a direct democratic system which 
jumps over the indirect, parliamentary democracy system." But 
the green papers system is an "indirect democratic system on 
policies" that supplements Diet efforts for deliberations; nor 
does it make light of the legislature. 
<H5>  Public Opinion System Being Formed </H5>
  Suppose Japan decides to adopt a by-pass system. In what 
manner should it operate? 
  It is unrealistic to ask the general public on all policy 
matters. Hence, its application should be limited to those 
matters that concern the lives of all the people, but over which 
interests could differ -- such as those on the consumption tax 
or pensions. 
  Second, the subject matters must be those for which policies 
are yet in the process of being formulated. If the people are 
to review draft policy matters already in the parliament as 
legislative bills, the parliament will lose the reason for its 
existence. If the system serves the purpose of a "public 
opinion survey" to collect information necessary in formulating 
policies, that should be good enough. 
  The administration should make analysis and predictions as 
detailed as done in formulating the green papers, and should 
present results of its review, offering a number of specific 
possible policies to choose from. It should never do such a 
thing as presenting a proposal to increase a tax, but hiding the 
increase rate it seeks from the public. 
  The existing government office think tanks, closed as they 
are, are busy day and night preparing materials to be used in 
review councils and drawing up answers to be used in Diet 
interpellations. If the think tanks can use more of their time 
in coming up with alternative policies that are convincing to 
the people, the organizations can become more "open 
organizations" indeed. The surveys need not cover all the 
eligible voters. If they are of enough scale to eliminate the 
deviation prone in statistics, that should be good enough, even 
though a some sort of braking system may be necessary. The 
results of the surveys may be only for information, but the 
politicians cannot ignore such results. 
  Distance between policies and the public will is causing the 
"closed society" to be closed even more. If we cannot expect 
the politicians to reform themselves, there is no choice but to 
open up the shell of the administration, and put a pipe of the 
public will through it.

  [Text] The ruling coalition parties decided 18 May to call 
on both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to cooperate in establishing a 
council on the tax system. The ruling coalition parties' Tax 
Reform Council is now working out reform bills to be ready by 
the end of June. However, there is little possibility that the 
Hata minority administration can win Diet approval for its 
bills. Therefore, the ruling parties decided to seek an 
agreement with the LDP and the SDPJ through tripartite 
consultations before the legislation of the bills. The LDP has 
also shown its intention to submit a motion of no confidence 
against the cabinet as soon as the budget bill for fiscal 1994 
is approved. The ruling parties are believed to be aiming at 
securing their hold on political power by proposing dialogues on 
policies. 
  With regard to the tax system reform, all parties agree on 
the need to continue income tax reductions after fiscal 1994. 
The LDP proposes not only to review the ratio of direct to 
indirect taxes, but also to discuss this matter in the context 
of the people's overall tax burden ratio, including social 
insurance charges. The SDPJ will soon start separate 
discussions with Sakigake [Harbinger] on tax system reform. In 
light of such a situation, the coalition parties plan to propose 
that the LDP, the SDPJ, and coalition parties should bring in 
their own bills for discussion to reach an agreement before the 
extraordinary Diet session scheduled for this fall. 
  Regarding raising indirect taxes, which is the focal point 
of 
the tax system reform, the ruling parties' Tax Reform Council is 
studying the possibilities of the following: 1) preparing 
several alternative proposals on this matter; and, 2) refraining 
from indicating concrete tax rates. The council is thus trying 
to leave room for discussions with the LDP and the SDPJ. It has 
already been decided that several alternative proposals 
concerning this matter will all be included in the report to be 
worked out by the basic tax system subcommittee in early June. 
  At a meeting of heads of the government and ruling parties 
held on 16 May, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said 
that the government's tax reform bill should be decided within 
June to prepare for the major industrialized nations' summit 
talks (the Naples summit). However, a senior ruling party 
official said on 18 May: "What the United States urges is the 
continuous implementation of income tax reduction to expand 
domestic demands. Even if discussions on how to secure revenue 
sources [to make up for the shortfall that may result from the 
tax reduction] should be delayed, it will not exert adverse 
influence upon Japan-U.S. relations." He thus showed the 
intention to entrust the ruling and opposition parties with 
discussing how to handle the consumption tax issue. 
  However, the Finance Ministry is believed to be demanding 
the 
enforcement of an income tax reduction together with a 
consumption tax hike after fiscal 1994. Coordination between 
the government and the ruling parties is expected to face rough 
going.

  [Text] On 23 May, the opposition Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ), Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Seiun 
[parliamentary] group agreed to set up the Policy Study Council 
(headed by Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the SDPJ Policy 
Board], a consultative body attended by legislators in charge of 
policy affairs in the two parties and the parliamentary group, 
and held the council's first session in the Diet building that 
day. During the session, the SDPJ, Sakigake, and Seiun agreed 
to create three panels on "welfare, administrative reform, and 
tax system reform"; "security"; and "agriculture." They also 
agreed to draw up plans for overhauling the current tax system 
by the end of June. The "Minshu no Arashi" [Storm of 
Democracy], a House of Representatives parliamentary group 
organized by legislators who broke away from the Japan New 
Party, is expected to join the Policy Study Council. The SDPJ, 
Sakigake, and Seiun intend to work out the plans for overhauling 
the current tax system in line with a set of policy agreements 
concluded among the ruling coalition parties; the plans are 
likely to call for abolishing or revamping the consumption tax 
and raising indirect taxes. The plans to be worked out by the 
two parties and Seiun, which hold the deciding vote in the Diet, 
are likely to have a decisive impact on the tax system reform's 
future. 
  On 23 May, the "Consultative Council on Welfare, 
Administrative Reform, and Tax System Reform" [headed by Shoichi 
Ide, chairman of the Sakigake General Council] held its first 
session in the Diet building to decide that: 1) two project 
teams on "welfare" and "administration and finance" will be 
organized; 2) the council will hold discussion from the position 
of salary earners, consumers, and women; and 3) legislators from 
the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party will be allowed to attend the council as 
observers. At the session, the council made clear its position 
of attaching importance to "administrative reform" by deciding 
to draw up plans for reforming administration and finances as 
part of efforts to reform the current tax system. The SDPJ, 
Sakigake, and Seiun intend to press the government and the 
ruling coalition parties to reform the current tax system by 
speedily drawing up plans for overhauling the current tax system 
in parallel with debates by the Tax System Reform Consultative 
Council of the ruling coalition parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Seismometer" column: "Shinseito Unity in </F>
Crisis--Members Voice Frustration With Ozawa"] 
  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is often called an 
"army" because of its strong unity since the time it was the 
Takeshita faction in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
However, its unity now faces a challenge. 
  As Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is Shinseito's "trump card," 
according to the group's secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, the 
Shinseito-led coalition was behind the formation of a joint 
floor group called "Kaishin" [Innovation] aimed at strengthening 
the Hata administration. The attempt, though, triggered the 
withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from 
the coalition, and the Hata administration has become the 
weakest government in the last 39 years. This turn of events 
prompted Shinseito members to express their frustration with 
Ozawa's political manners. While Ozawa still takes a bullish 
attitude, the "tremor" in the Shinseito is unlikely to be calmed 
easily. 
<H5>  Ozawa Urges Shinseito Unity </H5>
  "Unexpectedly, we are forced to run a minority government. 
In such circumstances, we must further strengthen our unity," 
Ozawa declared at the beginning of the 10 May meeting of 
Shinseito secretaries. The next day, Acting Secretary General 
Kozo Watanabe spoke to party members perplexed at recent 
developments on the political scene: "Our participation in 
Kaishin was determined through due process, as it was approved 
by the party secretariat." 
  The party executives responded quickly to questions from 
rank-and-file members because many younger lawmakers were very 
irritated with senior officials who, they felt, had not told the 
truth about the formation of "Kaishin." Even middle-ranking 
members in charge of interparty negotiations have shown their 
frustration with Ozawa's "arbitrary decisions." 
  Former Economic Planning Agency head Hajime Aino openly 
criticized Ozawa at the 6 May press conference in Saga City, 
saying, "Mr. Ozawa has too much power." 
<H5>  Friction Among Senior Officials </H5>
  On 9 May, Aino called on Ozawa at his office in the Diet to 
apologize for and withdraw his remark in Saga City. 
Nevertheless, Ozawa reportedly exploded at Aino, instead of 
forgiving him. 
  Since the coalition has lost its majority in the lower 
house, 
the opposition is urging an early reshuffle of the lower house 
standing committee chairmen. Shinseito's Eiji Okuda, who is 
chairman of the lower house Committee on Rules and 
Administration, called for consultations with the opposition, 
saying, "As the minority government, the coalition will have to 
accept almost all demands from opposition parties, or they will 
open all-out war against us." However, Ozawa and other coalition 
leaders adopted a policy of "filling the vacant seats according 
to the coalition's interests." 
  Okuda made his debut as a lower house member in the 1969 
general election. Prime Minister Hata and Ozawa are also from 
the "class of '69," and Okuda is now a top Shinseito leader, 
ranked alongside Acting Secretary General Watanabe. A senior 
party official, though, said, "Mr. Ozawa has been showing strong 
displeasure with Mr. Okuda since the inauguration of the 
Hosokawa administration because Mr. Okuda listens positively to 
the opinions of the opposition." 
  The official said relations between the two leaders became 
even worse after that, and now: "Mr. Ozawa never meets Mr. 
Okuda in person, even in the Diet." The class of '69 met on the 
evening of 9 May to reconfirm the unity of Shinseito's leaders' 
backing for Prime Minister Hata, but Ozawa did not show up. 
  The "monolithic" unity of Shinseito has been shaken, but the 
controversy over "Kaishin" is not the only reason for its 
critical condition. No-confidence motions against the Hata 
cabinet could be adopted whenever they are submitted, and the 
coalition always faces the possibility of a general election 
followed by a dissolution of the lower house. 
  As a younger Shinseito member noted: In such circumstances, 
the party "cannot rely on Mr. Ozawa's charisma alone." 
  Some senior members are calling for a complete revision of 
party strategy, noting that "Shinseito would be better off 
seeking ties with the majority group in the LDP if Mr. Ozawa is 
really serious about policy-oriented reorganization of politics." 
  Another senior official said "Shinseito has to adhere to an 
anti-LDP stance only because of his personal feelings." 
  Members, therefore, are losing confidence in the party's 
political stance. 
  Ozawa Still Shows Bullish Attitude 
  "Anti-Ozawa opinions" have come to the surface at the local 
level, too. Representatives of the Shinseito Nara Prefecture 
branch called at the party headquarters on 12 May, and handed 
over a written opinion directed to Prime Minister Hata and 
Secretary General Ozawa. The representatives called for more 
democratic decision-making procedures in Shinseito. 
  The representatives said: "It is hard for us to see the 
party's decision-making process. We believe this is a good 
opportunity to establish bottom-to-top communication in the 
party." In response, Acting Secretary General Watanabe politely 
said "we have no excuses." 
  The party executives said "no other local organization would 
take such action," but they are troubled by the protest. 
  Even in such circumstances, Ozawa still shows a bullish 
attitude. Following the inauguration of the Hata cabinet, Acting 
Secretary General Watanabe and Secretary Hajime Funada called at 
Ozawa's office to receive instructions on how to manage future 
political schemes. Ozawa reportedly told them he was confident 
he could break the LDP from the SDPJ because "the LDP will 
certainly become more arrogant." 
  In a press conference on the evening of 10 May, he declared 
the inauguration of the minority government is "a good chance to 
clarify our own policies." 
  Ozawa's political manner is often called the "logic of the 
majority and power." What will be the result of breaking the 
political deadlock now that Ozawa has lost the "majority" that 
was his ultimate weapon? 
  Shinseito executives plan to meet younger members at the 
party headquarters on 16 May to try to cool their criticism. 
Yet, Ozawa is still the key person when it comes to forecasting 
the direction of Shinseito.

  [Text] On 15 May, JIJI NEWS SERVICE released results of 
its monthly opinion poll in May, giving the support rate for the 
Hata administration for the first time. According to the public 
opinion poll, the support rate for the Hata administration was 
40.9 percent, down 5.3 percent from that of the Hosokawa 
administration surveyed in April. On the other hand, 27.6 
percent said they do not support the Hata administration (while 
the nonsupport rate for the Hosokawa administration in April was 
at 33.2 percent). It is quite unusual that an inaugurated prime 
minister is less popular than his resigning predecessor. Unlike 
the popular administration led by Hosokawa, Hata's support rate 
for the Hata administration was as low as former administrations 
of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Yet, it appeared many 
respondents want to watch future courses of the Hata 
administration, as 31.5 percent chose the "do not know" answer 
(compared with 20.6 percent in the April survey). Meanwhile, 
the support rate for the Japan New Party [JNP] has drastically 
dropped to 2.1 percent. 
  The JIJI poll was conducted 7-10 May--immediately after 
former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's resignation for his 
remarks on the Nanjing massacre--as individual interviews of 
2,000 eligible voters picked from all over the nation. 
Responses were obtained from 72.9 percent of the pollees. 
  The opinion poll has been conducted every month since the 
administration of former Prime Minister Shinsuke Kishi. Since 
then, Noboru Takeshita was the only prime minister who was less 
popular than his resigning predecessor. When Takeshita was 
inaugurated, his popularity was 3.1 percent lower than that of 
Yasuhiro Nakasone immediately before his resignation. 
  Among the pro-Hata cabinet respondents, the largest group of 
14.1 percent said they passively support Hata because they see 
"no other person suitable to be prime minister." This was 
followed by such responses as "the prime minister is 
trustworthy" (11.1 percent), "he gives a favorable impression" 
(9.5 percent), and "no changes would happen no matter who was 
prime minister" (7.9 percent). The largest group of anti-Hata 
respondents (16.5 percent) said they do not support him because 
they "cannot place hope on him." 
  With respect to support rates for individual political 
parties, the JNP's popularity was halved from the April poll 
(4.3 percent). This was even lower than the support rate for 
Komeito. The support rate for the LDP was at 21.3 percent (22.8 
percent in April); the Social Democratic Party of Japan was at 
6.8 percent (5.3 percent in April); Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] was at 4.6 percent (3.3 percent in April); Komeito was at 
2.5 percent (2.8 percent in April); the Japan Communist Party 
was at 1.4 percent (0.8 percent in April); and both the 
Democratic Socialist Party and Sakigake [Harbinger] were at 1.4 
percent, unchanged from the previous month.

<F P=106> [Article by AERA reporters Yoshiyuki Shuto, Yuri Oiwa, Koji </F>
Matsuzaki, and Yuka Itagaki: "SDPJ's Pullout Without a Clear 
`Strategy'"] 
  [Text] The "excitement" of young Diet members of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which has pulled out from the 
coalition government and gone into opposition, does not seem to 
calm down. 
  Shoichi Tanaka, [SDPJ Diet member from Kumamoto No. 1 
District] member of the SDPJ's Central Executive Committee, 
rattles on: 
  "I doubt their [the coalition partners] conscience. 
Restoring our trust in them is difficult, unless, for instance, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, 
who leads the new parliamentary bloc `Kaishin,' former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of the Japan New Party, Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Keigo Ouchi, and Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa of the Ichi-Ichi line, resign 
from their party posts." 
  Tanaka is a member of the SDPJ rightwing faction, the 
"Democrats." Based on his stand to maintain the coalition, he 
has been busily engaged in reaching a consensus on policy issues 
within his party to coordinate policies with other coalition 
partners since the birth of the Hosokawa cabinet. Because such 
was his effort, he feels betrayed all the more. 
  At the end of April immediately after the SDPJ decided to 
leave the government, AERA interviewed 27 SDPJ Diet members who 
are in their first or second terms. 
  Most of the SDPJ Diet members viewed the pullout as a matter 
of course, but the reasons for their "excitement" are not 
limited to emotional reaction against Ozawa's way of doing 
politics. 
  Ritsuo Hosokawa [Saitama No. 4 District] stressed: "It has 
become easier for the SDPJ to make its point. Although we 
cannot say which party we are going to align with, our course 
will become clear naturally as we maintain a policy of being 
fair and just." 
  In other words, now that the Hata cabinet has come into 
being 
as the minority governing party, the SDPJ holds a deciding vote, 
standing between the government and the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP]. Such "comfort" is part of the reasons SDPJ members are 
in high spirits, according to Hosokawa. 
<H5>  LDP-SDPJ Union: "Merely an Alliance of Convenience" </H5>
  However, the environment surrounding the SDPJ does not 
necessarily seem to let it enjoy such a feeling. 
  Kenji Yoshioka [SDPJ, Hyogo No. 5 District] thinks that 
there 
will be more Diet members, like members of New Party Mirai 
[Future] and Jiyuto [Liberal Party], who will leave the LDP, 
which has lost its political centripetal force as the governing 
party. Feeling this will lead to the isolation of the SDPJ, 
Yoshioka warns his fellow party members who are in jolly spirits 
as follows: "To think that we hold a deciding vote is wrong. 
If there are going to be more and more Diet members from the 
LDP joining the coalition, the government will become a major 
conservative group. To prevent that, among other reasons, we 
should have remained in the government." 
  While the SDPJ and the LDP are suddenly moving closer to 
each 
other since they both became the opposition, the possibility of 
it leading to birth of a "[LDP-SDPJ] coalition government" is 
very low. 
  If 206 members of the LDP join with 74 members of the SDPJ, 
the number combined easily exceeds the lower house majority of 
256. 
  At the meeting between LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori 
and 
SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo on 27 April, they confirmed 
that the two parties will cooperate in managing Diet affairs. 
  But many young SDPJ Diet members share the view of SDPJ 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama who warned against further hasty 
"cooperation between the LDP and the SDPJ:" "We will not let 
the LDP regain power, nor permit the rise of an LDP-like 
government." 
  Masanori Goto [Kochi district] said, "Coalition with the 
present LDP is unthinkable unless its rightwing members leave 
the party." 
  According to Ryuichi Ikeda [Hokkaido No. 1 District], "The 
LDP still has its money politics disposition--the former 
Takeshita faction, for example. Coalition with the whole LDP is 
impossible." 
  The SDPJ's basic policy toward political reorganization is 
to 
assemble "the SDPJ, the DSP, and liberal-minded political 
forces." 
  In that respect, the scope of alliance with the LDP is 
limited to the pro-Constitution liberal forces. "LDP-SDPJ 
coalition," in which the SDPJ aligns with the whole LDP, appears 
to be "nothing but an alliance of convenience without policies" 
(Tanaka). 
  SDPJ Divided on "Diet Dissolution" 
  Nevertheless, the LDP's enthusiasm for [aligning with] the 
SDPJ is really strong. 
  A symbolic scene was seen at a lower house plenary session 
on 
27 April, one day after the SDPJ's decision to leave the 
coalition. 
  The plenary session was held to discuss the extension of a 
law regarding a forest reserve, and when Takeshi Takeuchi, 
chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries, stood to explain the purpose of the law, it was LDP 
members who applauded him greatly. 
  Osamu Imamura [Aomori No. 1 District] thinks the LDP's 
applause was motivated by an "expectation." 
  "Most LDP Diet members and 70-80 percent of SDPJ Diet 
members 
want an election under the present multiseat constituencies deep 
in their hearts." 
  In other words, the applause of the LDP was its 
"expectation" 
for an alliance between the LDP and the SDPJ to overthrow the 
Hata cabinet, and realize dissolution of the lower house and a 
general election under the current system, according to Imamura. 
  However, the views of the young SDPJ Diet members are 
divided 
on this point because the political reform bills, which 
stipulate a single-seat electoral system in combination with 
proportional representation, have already passed the Diet, and 
transfer to the new electoral system is possible now as soon as 
new constituencies are drawn up. 
  The argument of Seiichi Kaneda [Hokkaido No. 3 District], in 
a sense, answers the "expectation" of the LDP: "Once an 
election is held under the single-seat constituency system, 
Ozawa's domination becomes absolute. To be honest, the current 
multiseat constituency system is the best." 
  The view of Izumi Yamazaki [Nagasaki No. 2 District] can be 
regarded as middle-of-the-road: "Since we voted for the 
political reform bills, it is difficult for the SDPJ to propose 
dissolution. Nevertheless, if a problem arises in relation to 
the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons program, appealing to the 
confidence of the whole nation is inevitable." 
  On the other hand, Ryuichi Doi [Hyogo No. 1 District] has a 
completely different view. "[If the next election is held] 
under the multiseat constituency system, the SDPJ will "revert 
to its old self" because it is possible to win a seat even if a 
candidate is against the introduction [as published] of a 
consumption tax, which, in consideration of the Japan's future, 
is inevitable. [An election under the present system] should 
not be carried out." 
<H5>  Confrontation Between the Right and the Left Remains </H5>
  Tax reform will be the largest issue in politics "after the 
passage of the fiscal 1994 budget." 
  How will the SDPJ cope with the issue since it agreed to 
consider "indirect taxes" at the policy coordination meeting 
before its departure from the coalition? 
  The members of the Democrat faction share almost the same 
opinions. Among them, Taisuke Sato [Aichi No. 1 District] said, 
"Leaving aside the discussion of whether [tax reform] is right 
or wrong, opposing any kind of tax reform is irresponsible and 
we cannot do so because our policy agreement with the coalition 
is an engagement made with the people." Sato's remark could be 
taken to mean he may cooperate with the government depending on 
the content of tax reform. 
  Tatsukuni Komori [Hiroshima No. 3 District], a leftist SDPJ 
Diet member who voted against the political reform bills, 
thinks, "Some members of the SDPJ will rejoin the government 
forces within several months, a year at the latest, assuming 
that the next general election is held under the single-seat 
constituency system." 
  Since the SDPJ's pullout from the coalition government was 
not triggered by a policy issue, the SDPJ at present might 
appear as if united. 
  However, the picture of confrontation between the right and 
the left forces within the party remains. The government will 
attempt to split the SDPJ by taking advantage of Diet members 
who do not remain members of the SDPJ. 
  Kenjiro Hatakeyama [Akita No. 1 District] said, "If we 
proceed with further reform of the party, without sticking to 
the left or the right, SDPJ members can work together as 
united." But, a persuasive, concrete plan was not heard from 
him.

  [Text] The ruling Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and the 
ruling New Japan Party are advocating breaking up the unified 
parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Innovation]. Commenting on the 
two ruling parties' move at an 18 May meeting of Komeito 
legislators, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said: 
"If the two ruling parties, which formed "Kaishin," have 
altered their policies, their leadership cannot escape the 
responsibility." In this way, he indicated that if the 
"Kaishin" is dissolved, Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the DSP; 
Morihiro Hosokawa, representative of the Japan New Party; and 
Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], would need to step down.

  [Text] Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], met with Koichi Kato [former 
chief cabinet secretary), representative of the "New Century 
Group," a suprafaction action group for new policies in the LDP, 
and others at a Tokyo restaurant in the evening of 18 May. 
During the meeting, Mr. Mori said: "If the people ask the LDP 
to forge an alliance with the opposition Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] after the Hata cabinet resigns en masse, the LDP 
would be willing to do so. The LDP also intends to forge an 
alliance with Sakigake [Harbinger Party]." In this way, Mr. 
Mori indicated that the LDP will examine the possibility of 
forging a coalition with the SDPJ and Sakigake after it submits 
a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet.

<F P=106> [Interview with New Party Mirai (Future) representative </F>
Michihiko Kano by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter: place 
and date not given -- from "Listening Without Reservation" 
column] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] You and your colleagues broke 
away from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Was 
there not a mistake in the timing of your breakaway from the LDP? 
  [Kano] I believe that we quit the LDP at the right time. We 
do not repent of our break from the LDP. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Why has your party not joined the new 
parliamentary group "Kaishin"? 
  [Kano] We do not know at all how or why the parliamentary 
group was formed. We just quit the LDP when the parliamentary 
group was formed and we heard nothing from other political 
parties about forming the parliamentary group. Our party could 
not draw a conclusion on whether to join the parliamentary group 
because our party values the process of making decisions through 
discussion. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What sort of political tactic do you 
think Prime Minister Hata should adopt? 
  [Kano] In my meeting with Prime Minister Hata, I proposed 
that parties and parliamentary groups that voted for Mr. Hata in 
the prime ministerial election at a Diet plenary session 
assemble to discuss issues, and asked the prime minister to tell 
the assembly what he thinks. However, the prime minister did 
not accept my requests. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] With a minority in the Diet, the Hata 
government is expected to have difficulty implementing policies 
after a budget bill for fiscal 1994 is enacted in the Diet. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Kano] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is 
sharing a common perception with other parties on the nine-point 
policy agreement. If the Hata government holds talks with the 
SDPJ to discuss policy matters forthrightly, the SDPJ would 
understand. If both ruling and opposition parties hold frank 
debates on how the current tax system should be reformed to turn 
Japan around, it would be possible to reach an agreement. Both 
ruling and opposition parties should make concerted efforts to 
grapple with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What sort of role does the "New Party 
Mirai" intend to play in the future? 
  [Kano] As for reforming the current tax system, our party 
plans to set forth a concrete vision that aims to improve the 
quality of life for the people through tax system reform. 
Regarding the issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear arms, our party intends to plead with that country to 
remain a nuclear-free nation. Our party also intends to make 
efforts to keep that country from being isolated from the rest 
of the world through diplomatic channels. Our party will 
advocate the need to keep all of Asia nuclear-free. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to increase your 
party's membership? 
  [Kano] Now that the Diet has enacted the political reform 
bill, the next task will be a realignment of the political 
parties. For our party to function properly in this drastically 
changing political situation, our party needs to reorganize 
itself on the basis of policies and political beliefs. Our 
party should set forth a set of new policies while pushing for 
reforms. Many people agree with our party's plans. There are 
many legislators in the LDP with whom I worked for the political 
reform. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that you and Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa are 
of the same political beliefs? 
  [Kano] I do not know all of what Mr. Ozawa thinks. We do 
not share the same views on handling the reforms, but we may 
share views that things must not be deferred until later. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the possibility of 
dissolving the House of Representatives? 
  [Kano] Our party resolutely opposes holding the next general 
elections under the current multiseat constituency system. What 
is important for us at the moment is to move things forward. 
Why did we spend seven years working for political reform? We 
should not set back political reform. To keep political reform 
on track, we have to speedily draft a bill on the demarcation of 
single-seat constituencies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime </F>
minister and foreign minister, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you not think that you were 
exploited by Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] concerning the problem of succession to former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa? 
  [Watanabe] There may be various viewpoints. We are 
professionals living in the political world, so it is possible 
that he may have used me as a card to obtain policy concessions 
from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. However, if 
the SDPJ made a concession because of that, it is good for the 
country, is it not? 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the Hata administration has 
a dual power structure or that the Hata administration is 
"Ozawa's cabinet." 
  [Watanabe] If a man can be a scenario writer and leading 
actor at the same time like former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, 
it is all right. However, a division of work is necessary to 
some extent. It may be that, since the two men are not 
different in their ideas, tickets will sell well if Hata, not 
Ozawa, dances on the stage. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Are you still thinking of leaving the LDP if 
that helps to eliminate a policy gap? 
  [Watanabe] The problem is that Shinseito and the LDP are at 
odds with each other despite the fact that their policies are 
almost identical. It will be difficult for the Hata 
administration to implement its policies unless it officially 
asks for the LDP's cooperation. I have been thinking of 
mediating between the two parties. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of your leaving the 
LDP if there is a chance of political realignment? 
  [Watanabe] It is too dangerous to make comments on that. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is a movement afoot in the LDP to come 
back to power in league with some members of the SDPJ and 
Sakigake [Harbinger]. 
  [Watanabe] Cooperation between the LDP and the SDPJ should 
be limited to the management of Diet affairs. If, however, the 
SDPJ breaks with convention and comes closer to our party in 
policy cooperation than when it formed an alliance with 
Shinseito and other parties, that would be another story. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What will be the nature of political 
realignment? 
  [Watanabe] I think there will be two lines of thought: one 
based on the main current of the LDP and the other different 
from that. The voluntary establishment of the Constitution is 
the LDP's platform, but we are not saying that we should amend 
Article 9 of the Constitution. It would be ridiculous not to 
discuss the problem of the Constitution since the world is 
changing in many spheres, like the problem of the environment 
and the problem of limiting property rights. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is a considerable difference between 
your way of thinking and the contents of LDP President Yohei 
Kono's interpellation at the Diet concerning the problem of 
security. 
  [Watanabe] I am not saying we should approve the exercise of 
the right of collective self-defense. What I am saying is: 
"Concerning UN peacekeeping activities, postwar management and 
attendance for the confiscation of weapons can be interpreted as 
collective security from the standpoint of the Constitution. 
Concerning national emergency laws, laws providing for the 
minimum requirement for security can be made within the 
framework of the Constitution. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] LDP President Yohei Kono has declared that 
he will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet in the 
current Diet session. 
  [Watanabe] If a no-confidence motion is to be submitted, 
there must be just cause for it. I am sure of one thing: It is 
not good for a minority government, which does not represent the 
will of the people, to deal with the next budget or to maintain 
a cabinet for a long time. However, if the Hata administration 
asks for our cooperation in pursuing the same policy as the 
LDP's, we cannot submit a no-confidence motion. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think will happen after a 
no-confidence motion is submitted? 
  [Watanabe] That is impossible to say because there is the 
other party, not just us. Speaking of dissolution by mutual 
consent, for example, it is also impossible to tell whether 
there is mutual consent. It will take time for the current Diet 
to pass bills on redrawing electoral districts, because the 
opinions of local governments must be listened to. And it is 
still unknown whether Prime Minister Hata will choose 
dissolution. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] If the Diet is dissolved before a bill on 
redrawing electoral districts is passed, that constitutes 
"torpedoing political reform," does it not? 
  [Watanabe] At any rate, since the single-seat constituency 
system was enacted by both the ruling and opposition parties, it 
is impossible to abolish it without using it even once.

<F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the </F>
Democratic Socialist Party, by an unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Diet is resuming. What is 
your party's basic position? 
  [Yonezawa] The coalition has turned into a minority 
government. We are in a difficult situation. The ruling and 
opposition parties may hold differing views on the issues of 
economic, administrative, and political reform, but they have a 
common understanding that these issues need to be addressed. 
Some people are talking about introducing in the Diet of a 
motion of no-confidence in the cabinet, but the thinking that 
"you must quit because you are a minority" is absurd. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] came up 
with the idea of forming the parliamentary group "Kaishin" which 
consequently caused the coalition to be driven into a minority. 
Don't you feel responsible for it? 
  [Yonezawa] During the eight-month-long Hosokawa government, 
we came to see the importance of all coalition parties being 
unified as colleagues in the same coalition. That is how we 
came to present the idea. We thought the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] did not object to the idea. Timing, or 
maybe the procedure for presenting it, could have been wrong. 
Anyway, it is regrettable that the idea caused displeasure. We 
thought only simply, "New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], the SDPJ, 
and Komeito can join us as they please." We had not anticipated 
this reaction. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] We see your party is moving toward 
cooperating with the Japan New Party [JNP]. 
  [Yonezawa] It is reported that the voices calling for 
dissolution of "Kaishin" are pouring out even in the Japan New 
Party. Meanwhile, relations between that party and the DSP are 
fairly good. I think it would be good for the two parties to 
build trust between them through regular policy discussions and 
other events. If it develops into a possibility of forming a 
new party, that will have to be dealt with only in a party 
congress. So, the relationship can develop into a sort of joint 
floor group. All this needs to be discussed further, and I don't 
know what will happen. But anyway the JNP is a partner with 
which friendly relations will be maintained. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the departure of the SDPJ 
from the coalition has resulted in a tripolar political 
structure [the political world divided into "Kaishin, the 
Liberal Democratic Party, and the SDPJ]. But what do you think 
about the liberals in the SDPJ and the DSP? 
  [Yonezawa] Regarding the political world reorganization, 
some people talk about the two-party system, some about a 
tripolar system, and some about a multiparty system. That is 
something which only the people should decide. But if a 
single-seat district electoral system were to be adopted, 
normally what would happen is that the politicians choose and 
fight for one of two political axes. I wonder if the framework 
of the SDPJ and the DSP is sufficient to be one of the two axes. 
I can understand the ongoing political current that shows the 
people who have opposed the LDP now want to develop into a 
policy-oriented force. But I still don't see what kind of 
political reorganization the liberals have in their minds or 
what policy lines they want to follow. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How does your party plan to deal with the 
issues of tax reform and the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear 
development program? 
  [Yonezawa] To fix and retain tax reductions as a permanent 
thing and to expand domestic demand in this country can be said 
to be our international commitment. If we do not carry out tax 
reform, that will impact the world economy adversely, too. On 
the other hand, indirect taxes are a kind of costs for 
participating in society. Without the indirect taxes, we cannot 
make the ends of national treasury meet. As far as the North 
Korean question is concerned, the government's responsibility is 
to do thorough work on rules and laws. The expression -- 
legislation for emergencies -- may not be appropriate, but we 
need to have discussions completed. I have no choice but to 
object to the view that not even discussions are necessary. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your stand on the manner in which 
the next election should be conducted? 
  [Yonezawa] It is only natural that the next general election 
should be conducted under the new system. SDPJ Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama suggested holding talks to see whether the 
next election should be held under the medium electoral district 
system. That is a most conservative view. Holding an election 
under the medium electoral system means destroying the political 
reform altogether, and the people of the nation will not permit 
such a thing to happen. The bill on electoral district zoning 
should be discussed without delay. Fighting the next general 
election under the small district system -- even if it means 
shortening the duration of public announcement -- is the only 
way to complete political reform. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the voices of criticism 
raised against Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? 
  [Yonezawa] I have never felt they were high-handed or pushy. 
There may be problems with the mass news media which are playing 
up stories on the so-called "Ichi-Ichi duo"? 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] We sometimes see differences of view in 
remarks made by DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and you, the secretary 
general. 
  [Yonezawa] The DSP is a party where there are so many views. 
If the two people spoke the same words on every issue, I don't 
think you would like it at all.

<F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, Democratic Socialist Party </F>
[DSP] secretary general, by unidentified SANKEI SHIMBUN 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The minority ruling parties will 
be forced into hard sailing in Diet management. 
  [Yonezawa] Actually, we have yet to feel that steering the 
political situation is a very difficult task. Indeed, the 
opposition and ruling parties are opposed to each other. 
However, both sides share the common sense of value over policy 
matters, including tax system reform, administrative reform, and 
political reform. Therefore, we will do our best to reach a 
mutual agreement. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is 
planning to call for a no-confidence motion in the cabinet 
immediately after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved. 
  [Yonezawa] It will pursue the party's interest at the 
nation's expense if the LDP tries to call for a no-confidence 
motion by saying unreasonable things. Dissolution of the Diet 
and holding a general election under the current medium-sized 
constituency system may kill political reform. We need to enact 
the redistricting bills to introduce the single-seat system 
during the current Diet session. After that, we can dissolve 
the Diet and hold a fair and square election under the new 
system, if necessary. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Do you think the cabinet will be dissolved 
or will the cabinet resign en masse if a no-confidence motion is 
submitted? 
  [Yonezawa] Many members of the LDP and the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] also hold the view that an election should 
not be held under the medium-sized constituency system. I am 
sure that a gap will be created within the LDP and the SDPJ if 
the executive departments of both parties try to forcefully 
approve a no-confidence motion. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Do you think a freeze has been imposed on 
the activities of the "Kaishin" parliamentary group? 
  [Yonezawa] Party members and the Yuaikai, a supporting 
group, had no objection to the idea of strengthening unity among 
the ruling parties by forming the Kaishin. It may be easy to 
dissolve the group. However, there is a possibility that a 
dissolution may create discord among the ruling parties. We 
would like to carefully study the possibility. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Some people pointed out the executive 
department's responsibility. 
  [Yonezawa] We have to clarify our responsibility for the 
consequence. There are many ways of assuming responsibility. 
However, we will follow the general trend within the party. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] There is a movement within the DSP to 
cooperate with the Japan New Party [JNP]. 
  [Yonezawa] We are trying to cooperate with the JNP because 
the JNP and DSP are close in terms of policy matters. Our 
cooperation may serve as a means to calm down the confusion and 
restlessness created over the "Kaishin" issue. We are scheduled 
to have a policy meeting next week to give shape to our 
cooperation. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] It seems that the issue of extending the 
current Diet session will emerge over the issue of enacting the 
redistricting bills and other matters. 
  [Yonezawa] The issue of extending the Diet session may 
develop into a major controversy depending on when the 
redistricting bills will be submitted. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How do you think the tax system reform will 
be concluded? 
  [Yonezawa] At each important stage, we need to explain the 
contents of discussions among the ruling parties to the LDP and 
the SDPJ. We should maintain our stance of listening to their 
opinions. We can listen to their opinions while we are still 
discussing the issue or after we map out our plans. Another 
method we can adopt to enact tax system reform bills is to form 
a joint council composed of members of the opposition and ruling 
parties. 
  [SANKEI SHIBMUN] Do you think actual figures, including tax 
rates, should be clarified in the bills? 
  [Yonezawa] I think we should clarify figures as much as 
possible. The best way is to include actual numbers in the 
bills. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Over the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms development, some people are talking about the 
possibility of introducing new laws to deal with emergency 
situations and about the right of collective self-defense. 
  [Yonezawa] They are obsessed with words without considering 
the gap with reality. It is a matter of course for the 
government to be prepared for an emergency no matter what the 
case may be. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Will the ruling parties form a new new 
party [shin shinto] to help each other in an election under a 
new system? 
  [Yonezawa] The best way for us is to agree on policy matters 
and to put up joint candidates rather than trying to eliminate 
each other. Many SDPJ members think the party has to change. 
We should attach more importance to forbearance than to 
cleanliness. We need to unite together.

<F P=106> [From the "How Will the Tense Political Situation Change in </F>
the Future?" column; interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of 
Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation), by unidentified 
ASAHI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] appears to be intending to force the Hata cabinet to 
dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general 
election by submitting to the Diet a vote of no confidence 
against it. What is your opinion? 
  [Yamagishi] The LDP is asserting that the Hata cabinet 
deserves to be voted out of power merely because it is a 
minority government, but I believe that the LDP's assertion 
lacks persuasive force. The opposition Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] has to alter its simple logic that "the enemy of 
my enemy is my friend." 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some SDPJ members are voicing their support 
for holding the next general election under the current 
multiseat constituency system. What do you think? 
  [Yamagishi] If the next general elections are held under the 
multiseat constituency system, the SDPJ would win some more 
seats in the House of Representatives, but the LDP also would 
increase its seats there. The next general election could be 
held under the multiseat constituency system depending on how 
the political situation develops in the future. I, however, 
believe that it is desirable to hold the next general election 
under a new electoral system. The SDPJ is now at a loss. If 
the SDPJ intends to rally liberal forces, it cannot forge any 
alliance with the LDP. If the SDPJ does not take the position 
of not allowing the LDP to retake power, it would leave ruling 
coalition parties in disarray. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of the SDPJ 
returning to the ruling coalition? 
  [Yamagishi] I believe that it would be difficult for the 
SDPJ 
to return to the ruling coalition unless a major development 
occurs which makes the people understand its return to the 
ruling coalition. 
  I hope that such a "major development" will occur to open 
the 
way for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. The SDPJ's 
intention of rallying the liberal forces does not contradict its 
return to the ruling coalition. If the SDPJ does everything it 
can to rally the liberal forces, this would cause the "major 
development" to occur. There is no change in the widely held 
impression that the coalition government is shored up by new 
conservative forces and liberal forces. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you mean by the major development? 
May I interpret the major development as the resignation of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] representative Ichiro Ozawa? 
  [Yamagishi] If I comment publicly on that, it would cause 
confusion and make it hard for the major development to occur. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata government is shaky because it is a 
minority government. Do you think that the Hata government can 
trigger the major development? 
  [Yamagishi] Given the values and integrity of Prime Minister 
Hata, I cannot rule out that possibility. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Mr. Ozawa? 
  [Yamagishi] I do not know him well, but he is currently 
making a lot of belligerent comments. He imposes his ideas on 
others when he holds a dialogue with them. He is causing human 
relationships to worsen. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of the SDPJ 
returning to the coalition government? 
  [Yamagishi] The possibility still exists. If the SDPJ clings 
to its own policies, it is doubtful whether it can reach an 
agreement on basic policies with Sakigake [Harbinger]. The SDPJ 
would be isolated from the rest of the political parties in the 
end. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will it not difficult for the SDPJ to rally 
the liberal forces prior to the general election? 
  [Yamagishi] If the SDPJ fails to rally the liberal forces 
prior to the general election, it will face self-destruction. 
If only the SDPJ and Sakigake wage a concerted campaign under 
the single-seat constituency system, they will be no match for 
other political parties. A majority of the liberal forces are 
now in the ruling coalition parties, and they are affiliated 
with the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], the Japan New Party, 
Shinseito, and a splinter group from the LDP. Now is the best 
time for the SDPJ to open the way for concluding a policy 
agreement with those liberal forces, forging an alliance with 
new conservative forces in Shinseito and Komeito, and choosing a 
single candidate to run in the next general election. Hokkaido 
Governor Takahiro Yokomichi and Sakigake representative 
Masayoshi Takemura can take the lead in rallying the liberal 
forces. I think that it is desirable to form a liberal 
coalition policy study group which transcends party affiliations. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is whispered that DSP Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi 
will resign as chairman at a party convention scheduled for June. 
  [Yamagishi] Any decisions to be made at the party convention 
will have a great impact on the future of the former ruling 
coalition parties, including the SDPJ. I will pay close 
attention to the party convention. I hope that the DSP will play 
a key role in urging the SDPJ to return to the coalition 
government. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When are you going to give your approval to 
raising indirect taxes with "some conditions attached?" 
  [Yamagishi] In principle, I do not favor raising any taxes, 
but I intend to urge the Policy Consultative Council formed by 
the SDPJ and the DSP to speedily work out a joint proposal, 
thereby deepening their mutual understanding, and to ask the two 
parties to present the joint proposal to other parties.

  [Text] Fujitsu Ltd. has decided to triple procurement of 
foreign-made parts and materials by fiscal 1996 to increase the 
share of foreign-made parts to 30 percent of the total parts it 
uses. Foreign-made parts are becoming less expensive due to the 
recent appreciation of the yen, and Fujitsu intends to focus on 
cost reduction through expanding use of foreign-made parts, 
aiming at rehabilitation of worsened business records. In 
addition to an office in Singapore, Fujitsu will open another 
parts procurement office in Taiwan, and subsidiaries in China 
will also expand parts supply to Japan. Earlier, NEC 
Corporation announced its decision to increase purchases of 
computer parts made in Southeast Asia; however, Fujitsu is the 
first major computer manufacturer to indicate a target figure of 
import increase. 
  Fujitsu's computer and telecommunications section uses many 
electronic parts, plastic materials, metal parts, and cables, 
and the total amount of parts procurement reaches approximately 
1.2 trillion yen (including 600-700 billion yen purchase from 
subsidiary companies). Foreign-made parts presently share about 
10 percent of Fujitsu's annual parts purchase, but the company 
intends to increase the rate to 30 percent of parts used by 
Fujitsu and its subsidiaries in Japan. 
  Fujitsu's procurement section currently has an outpost 
office 
in Singapore, and is dealing with about 40 parts and material 
manufacturers in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. To expand 
procurement from Asian companies, the Singapore office will open 
business with companies in Indonesia and other countries. 
Moreover, Fujitsu intends to open another office in Taiwan 
before the end of this year for reinforcing procurement of 
Taiwanese-made computer parts. Even in China, Fujitsu is 
planning to boost production of telecommunication devices in its 
subsidiary, and to open a new joint venture company to produce 
printers. Chinese-made parts used in these plants will also be 
exported to Japan to push up the rate of foreign-made parts. 
  Fujitsu is suffering a sales slump in the computer section, 
which earns 70 percent of the company's total profits, since the 
first quarter of 1993. Market demands for larger multipurpose 
computers are in decline mainly because of the prolonged 
recession and downsizing (shift of consumer demands to smaller 
models). In the January-March quarter of 1994, the sales of 
Fujitsu computers is expected to drop to 1.49 trillion yen, down 
15.4 percent from the previous quarter, and that of the entire 
company will remain at 2.16 trillion yen, down 9.9 percent. 
  Fujitsu marked an 8.7 billion yen business loss in the 
October-December quarter in 1993, but, in the January-March 
quarter, the company is expected to announce 27 billion yen 
profits owing to cost reductions and business rationalization 
efforts. Yet, the business sector is reducing computer-related 
investments under the recession, and consumers are leaning 
toward less expensive models. Under such circumstances, a top 
official said "a drastic increase in sales is unlikely." 
Fujitsu is being pressed by an urgent need for cost reduction.

  [Text] Details of a report, prepared by a 
telecommunications policy department of the Telecommunications 
Council (chaired by Fumio Watanabe, adviser to Tokyo Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.), an advisory panel to the posts and 
telecommunications minister, were disclosed on 23 May. The 
council has been studying how the government should build a 
foundation for the information telecommunications system for a 
multimedia era in the 21st century. The report says that an 
optical fiber network, which can transmit a large amount of 
information, should cover all offices and homes in the nation by 
2010 and thereby create a social system adoptable to a 
full-scale multimedia era. The report also proposes that the 
government should aim at reforming people's lives and the 
national economy for the 21st century. To do that, the report 
sets three stages, proposing that the optical fiber network 
should be created to cover metropolitan areas and prefectural 
capitals by the year 2000, all cities with a population of 
100,000 or more by 2005, and all cities in the nation by 2010. 
Moreover, the report points out the need to utilize the private 
sector's vital power as much as possible by allowing the project 
to be carried out mainly by the private sector. The report will 
be submitted to a general meeting of the council for 
deliberation on 31 May. After that, it will be submitted to 
Post and Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa. 
  The report comprises seven chapters. The first and second 
chapters present a vision of upgraded communications based on 
the optical fiber network serving as a key to solve pending 
problems, including the aging of society and decentralization of 
the population. Moreover, the report predicts that creation of 
new multimedia-related businesses to serve the network would 
produce a 123 trillion yen multimedia market and about 2.43 
million jobs by 2010. 
  In the third chapter, which explains concrete plans for the 
network construction, the report says a total of 33-53 trillion 
yen would be needed to construct the optical fiber network. If 
the cables are placed underground, an additional 42 trillion yen 
will be necessary, the report predicts. To reduce the financial 
burdens of private companies that create the network, the report 
urges the government to consider setting up zero-interest loans 
and special tax relief. 
  The report sets the year 2000, when Japan's population is 
expected to peak, as a target for completion of the optical 
fiber network. The report emphasizes that introduction of the 
network in public institutions nationwide, including schools, 
libraries, hospitals, town halls, and welfare facilities, should 
be completed by 2000 and that the network should be used as a 
means to trigger demand for the network, especially in 
depopulated local communities. 
  In regard to construction of the network, the report clearly 
states a plan designed to carry out the project mainly by the 
private sector. As for the government's role, the report says 
that it "should be limited to creating a favorable environment 
for private companies and to keep gaps between localities at a 
minimum to secure consumers' interest."

  [Text] (London--14 May) British leading computer maker ICL 
reached an agreement with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) 
to provide the latter with consulting services encompassing all 
phases of information security systems. The services will cover 
all information computerized by NTT in the areas of customer and 
employee data. NTT has already launched a joint study with ICL 
to review the adequacy of information management and, if 
necessary, plans to procure equipment and software to reinforce 
its information security systems. 
  NTT currently stores and manages computerized data on 
individuals and clients for about 230,000 employees and 57.3 
million circuits. The current review on the status of security 
management was initiated because advances in data processing and 
communications technology have increased the risk of illegal 
exploitation or theft of personal information. 
  ICL was chosen for the consulting contract because of its 
participation as a principal player in the European Union's (EU) 
information safety management technology-enhancement project 
(commonly referred to as the SESAME Project), abundant knowledge 
of the subject matter and its extensive record providing 
information security services to the British Government and 
major European and U.S. businesses. 
  ICL has already submitted its opinion paper on improving the 
security management technology of NTT's information systems and 
both firms are now undertaking a detailed review in response to 
that paper. It appears that the improvement actions being 
considered include restrictions on access to computer networks 
through the use of integrated circuit cards and protective 
technology which prevents illegal outside access to data bases. 
  NTT is expanding its purchases of materials and equipment 
from overseas sources, but the EU has always been discontented 
with what it viewed as NTT's preference for U.S. sources. There 
is the potential that the current consulting agreement with ICL 
will lead to the procurement of security-related equipment and 
software from ICL. Fujitsu holds an 80-percent ownership 
position in ICL and will provide the latter with operational 
support.

  [Text] The International Marine Satellite Organization 
(INMARSAT) whose membership includes communications companies of 
74 nations will establish a satellite-based mobile 
communications operating firm by the end of 1994. The 
organization had launched a goal to establish a global 
satellite-based cellular telephone service project called 
"INMARSAT P" by the year 2000 and had been conducting a review 
as to whether it should handle the project as a parent-company 
function or under the control of a subsidiary. Kokusai Denshin 
Denwa (KDD) which is Japan's only member of the organization 
intends to invest in the new company. 
  The decision to establish the new company was made at 
INMARSAT's recent board meeting held in London. Further, an 
informal decision has been made to operate the satellite at a 
"medium orbit" of 13,155 kilometers altitude. 
  The new company will first be established with capital 
completely paid for by businesses that are currently members and 
investors in INMARSAT, and its monopolistic characteristic will 
be lessened by subsequent capital contributions of 30 percent by 
businesses that are not members of INMARSAT. INMARSAT P will 
provide telephone, facsimile, and data communications services 
using palm-sized cellular instruments. Its goal is to begin 
services in 1999 or 2000 after an investment of about $2.4 
billion. 
  Several private-sector projects such as Motorola's "Iridium 
Project" are under way to provide global cellular communication 
services. It appears that INMARSAT decided to establish a 
separate company for fear that operation of the proposed system 
by INMARSAT itself might lead to criticism of "unfair 
competition."

  [Text] The Telecommunications Council, a Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] advisory organ, published a 
draft report on 12 May which will serve as the guide for 
establishment of an advanced information society and envisions 
"optical fiber cable to homes" by 2010 with an optical fiber 
network which encompasses households on a nationwide basis. The 
concept can be considered as Japan's version of Vice President 
Gore's "information superhighway concept," but there are many 
problems to be resolved when one considers the details of how 
and who will raise the necessary capital. The issues will 
certainly inspire renewed future debate together with arguments 
in favor of breaking up Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) 
which is considered too powerful. 
  The draft report published by the Telecommunications Council 
on 12 May reflects the strong desire of the MOPT to build a 
next-generation communications network and reflects ambitious 
goals which call for both the government and private sector to 
take more extensive actions than ever envisioned in the past. 
  However, as the report indicates, installation of the 
optical 
fiber cable network alone will require a vast investment of 
33-53 trillion yen by 2010. The critical business organization 
to handle the installation work itself remains to be 
established. The reality is that many hurdles must be overcome 
in implementing the project. 
  The initial passage of the introductory paragraph of the 
draft report states, "Japan now stands at a crucial crossroads." 
These words reflect a sense of crisis wherein strong concern is 
being expressed about the reversal of Japanese-U.S. 
competitiveness in the high-tech arena and the potential that 
Japan will be outdistanced by the rest of the world in the 
communications sector. The report is configured so that it 
reflects strong awareness of action being taken in the United 
States, such as the installation of optical fiber networks 
encompassing schools and hospitals by 2000. 
  Chapter 4 of the report comments, "We observe more than just 
a few cases where so-called new media didn't succeed in the 
past." Officials of the MOPT Communications Policy Bureau state, 
"Wording like this is unprecedented and merely provides a strong 
indication of the lessons we learned from experience with past 
projects." Put another way, those words merely reflect an honest 
acknowledgment of past failures of "teletopia ideas" and a 
determination to create a visionary but practical concept for 
the future. 
  Actually, the Telecommunications Council has held over 30 
subcommittee meetings during the past 14 months. MOPT councils 
normally operate for two to three months and meet only three or 
four times, but the duration and frequency of Telecommunications 
Council subcommittee sessions were of an unprecedented magnitude. 
  On 11 May, the day before the draft report was submitted to 
the Telecommunications Council for review on the 12th, more than 
20 representatives of the financial world gathered secretly at 
an MOPT facility in Tokyo. The group included adviser Yoshihisa 
Tabuchi of Nomura Securities and director and advisor Osamu 
Sakurai of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.. The gathering marked 
the launching of the "Communications Business Policy Council" 
(chaired by Chairman Sho Nasu, Tokyo Electric Power Company), 
whose members come primarily from the private sector and which 
is attended by the directors of the Communications Policy, 
Teleommunications, and Broadcast Bureaus of the MOPT as 
observers. 
  It is a fact that the business world has strong expectations 
for the growth of the information sector and that the draft 
report takes the position that the private sector will play a 
principal role in the construction of the information 
infrastructure, amidst an absence of signs of a full-scale 
economic recovery. 
  However, on the other hand, the MOPT embraces the strong 
hope 
that the momentum inspired by emerging movements of the above 
nature will serve to favorably influence funding decisions. 
Speaking of MOPT budgets, major budget categories such as 
postal, postal savings, and simplified insurance are covered by 
special accounts. The initial fiscal year 1994 budget for MOPT 
public works projects provided only 5.3 billion yen. The reason 
is that the MOPT had a burning desire to acquire general 
accounts budget funding for the information-communications 
sector. 
  However, even some sources at MOPT express fear that the 
"required funding estimates" found in the draft report "are not 
based on sound data." Basically, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
is negative on the use of fiscal funds for construction of 
communications infrastructure because such funding would be 
inconsistent with the privatization of NTT and some sources 
express the opinion that, if conditions remain unchanged, an MOF 
which faces difficulties with tax revenues is unlikely to 
increase budgets for sectors that lack any meaningful 
performance record. 
  Now that the draft report has been published, attention will 
be focused on how competition will be encouraged among 
businesses in the installation of optical fiber cable networks. 
Pending resumption of debate on the break up of NTT some time 
next year, the draft report strongly launches the idea of "fair 
competition." The idea seems to reflect the goal of restraining 
NTT, which launches business operations on an overwhelming scale. 
  The draft report shows strong signs of competing with the 
U.S. "information superhighway idea." A look at the schedule in 
which Japan is to complete installation of optical fiber 
networks by 2010 shows that Japan will be progressing on a 
shoulder-to-shoulder basis with the United States. 
  To begin with, the question is why has Japan fallen behind 
the United States. The MOPT and the communications industry 
state that the reason rests with the fact that Japan sits far 
behind the United States in terms of personal computer 
installations, cable television [CATV] subscribers, and cellular 
telephone hookups. They attribute the creation of an information 
boom based on the Gore concept to the maturity of the U.S. 
computer software industry. 
  As a practical matter, it was the CATV companies in the 
United States which took the initiative in providing two-way 
communication services in response to the Gore concept. Further, 
Internet, which is a grassroots network, is drawing much 
attention now as a principal role player among next-generation 
communications networks. 
  Private-sector business logic would seem to dictate that if 
"actual demand" does not exist in Japanese markets, it would be 
advisable to delay investments in optical fiber cable networks, 
but the draft report for whatever reason places emphasis on 
completing such investments simultaneously with the United 
States. Although the draft report speaks of the user being the 
primary driving force, it persists in the concept of placing 
supply before demand. 
  On the other hand, the draft report stresses private-sector 
competition, but in Japan the situation is such that NTT could 
well become the sole winning player with a predominant role, 
compared to the United States where CATV firms have grown to 
levels equalling communications firms and actively engage in 
competition and business affiliations. Although the report 
speaks of competition under such circumstances, it lacks in 
providing a real sense of competition. 
  In the final analysis, the MOPT will probably endeavor to 
maintain a competitive market by assisting in the development of 
a force to counter NTT in the form of CATV and newly formed 
electric power company-affiliated telephone companies. MOPT in 
December 1993 launched a plan to promote CATV participation in 
the communications sector. At one time, the MOPT extended lower 
priority to new electric power company-affiliated telephone 
companies because they came under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, but they have no 
choice now but to nurture organizations of that nature. Fiscal 
year 1995 will see a rekindling of the debate on a split-up of 
NTT. The draft report which calls for fair competition among 
various businesses could potentially induce a renewed call for 
breaking up NTT.

  [Text] City banks plan to increase fiscal year 1994 lending 
in overseas areas by about 3 percent over the last fiscal year. 
The reason is that in addition to the expected expansion in the 
U.S. economy, the demand for capital is expanding in Asia based 
on a high-growth economy. Aside from a substantially higher 
growth rate for overseas loans compared to domestic loans, it is 
anticipated that the balance of overseas loans on a 
yen-denominated basis will increase for the first time in three 
years. 
  At Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank, fiscal year 1994 lending in 
the 
United States will increase about 3 percent over the last fiscal 
year, and will increase about 10 percent in Asia. According to 
Managing Director Hisao Kobayashi of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, 
"Overseas lending will increase beginning in the January-March 
quarter." Sumitomo Bank and Asahi Bank also have similar plans 
primarily for the Asian region. 
  Trends of the above nature had become conspicuous after 
October 1993. According to a Bank of Japan [BOJ] survey, the 
balance of loans issued by overseas branches at the end of 
January 1994 stood at 49.0423 trillion yen, an increase of about 
1.5 trillion yen in four months. The BOJ has arrived at the 
opinion that "overseas lending will most likely increase in the 
future with the second half of 1993 representing the turning 
point." 
  One reason city banks' overseas lending is on the rise is 
that domestic lending has stopped growing. Some signs of 
improvement have been seen in the domestic economy, but it is 
expected that demand for capital will remain sluggish and growth 
in domestic loans is expected to range about 1-2 percent over 
the last fiscal year. 
  City banks' equity ratios as of the end of March had reached 
9 percent, which is above the minimum specified by the Bank for 
International Settlements. This improvement has enabled a 
substantial increase in yen-denominated overseas assets, 
providing a favorable impact on city banks' capabilities to 
expand loans in overseas areas. 
  Growth in Asia is the greatest on a regional basis. There is 
a boom in the location of Japanese businesses centered in China 
and ASEAN nation are experiencing strong demand for capital to 
handle the construction of infrastructure. City banks intend to 
maintain a growth rate of around 10 percent for loans in the 
region. 
  Even lending activity in the United States, which had 
dropped 
steadily since 1990, has stopped falling in response to an 
economic recovery. Demand for new loans is expanding in a broad 
spectrum of businesses ranging primarily from manufacturing to 
small and medium businesses. Fuji Bank reveals it has "expanded 
loans to U.S. firms at the rate of 10 to 15 percent above the 
levels in the last fiscal year."

  [Text] Leading banks such as Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo 
Bank, which had been considering the issuance of preferred stock 
in the footsteps of Sakura Bank, have decided to take no action 
on necessary revisions to their bank charters during the 
upcoming June 1994 shareholders meetings. They have arrived at 
the assessment that there is no need to issue preferred stock to 
improve their bank equity position, because an improvement in 
stock prices has caused a rise in the equity of the respective 
banks. There had been the view that the issuance of preferred 
stock on the part of banks would translate into the diversion of 
a large amount of funds and an adverse effect on the stock 
market, but that issue can now be avoided. 
  Preferred stock does not provide for voting by the holder, 
but offers a higher dividend than that payable on the common 
stock. Financial institutions consider preferred stock as a 
favorable instrument for increasing equity. Issuance of 
preferred stock requires a revision of the bank charter 
authorizing the board of directors to take the issuing action. 
  Sakura Bank, which was behind the industry in improving its 
equity position, revised its charter at the shareholders' 
meeting in June 1993 and in March 1994 issued 100 million yen in 
preferred stock. Since the sale went well, the majority of the 
leading banks considered taking similar action, but decided 
against such revision of their charters. 
  The reason given was that the dividend obligation would be 
higher than with common shares and would be a costly action. 
Further, a rise of equity ratios (based on a broad definition of 
equity ratio in comparison with a calculation of assets 
considering various risks) at the banks concerned above the 
required level of 8 percent lessened the need to replenish 
equity, providing another reason to forgo a revision of 
charters. The Bank of Tokyo equity ratio stood at 10 percent at 
the end of March 1994, and it reached 9 percent at the 
Industrial Bank of Japan, which was relatively low. 
  The unfavorable attitude of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
toward charter revisions also served as a reason for the banks' 
decisions to forgo the changes. In administrative guidance 
issued in February 1994, the MOF had encouraged the issuance of 
preferred stock, but after March it came to the decision that 
any attempt to raise large amounts of capital would have an 
adverse effect on the supply and demand situation in the capital 
markets and reversed itself in asking that the banks forgo their 
plans to revise their charters. 
  The MOF had estimated that if bank charters were revised, 
banks would issue preferred stock en mass and soak up about 1 
trillion yen in funds from the capital markets. It appears that 
the MOF had come to the conclusion that any large-scale funding 
actions by banks would lead to a drop in stock prices.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has completed its plans to deregulate the liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) industry and related LPG-handling 
procedures. The "Committee To Study LPG Handling Procedures," a 
private advisory organ of the Environmental Protection and 
Industrial Location Bureau, will be established soon and will be 
charged with the mission of formulating detailed deregulating 
plans by this fall. If all goes well, the "Law Regulating the 
Maintenance and Marketing of LPG" will be revised in fiscal year 
1995. 
  The study committee will revise standards for establishing 
LPG replenishment stations that will become wholesalers of LPG 
and retail outlets and will provide for tanks which are larger 
than those allowed in the past. It will also study relaxation of 
the approval standards for domestic gas appliances. 
  In its International Economic Reform Outline completed at 
the 
end of March, the government announced that it would partially 
relax the maintenance regulations concerning dispensing 
equipment used by LPG sales firms. The government has decided to 
expand the scope of deregulation in that the number of 
LPG-related accidents has trended downward to 115 cases per year 
in the past three years. 
  As many as 35,000 retail outlets handle sales to households 
and they consist primarily of small and midsized firms, 
reflecting slow progress in the consolidation of sales and 
distribution outlets. Thus, it appears the study will be 
designed to relax pertinent regulations, promote lower prices, 
and encourage the reorganization of the LPG industry. 
  Domestic LPG demand for fiscal year 1995 will be about 19.42 
million tons, about 5 percent of primary energy consumption. The 
view is expanding that LPG companies and city gas companies will 
be engaging in a fierce price war because the Gas Business Law 
revision pending in the Diet will relax regulations which 
control entry into large-scale gas businesses.

  [Text] Major Japanese trading companies are increasing 
personnel assigned to Asia. The objective is to promote a 
rapidly growing market. Sales handled in the region by trading 
firms represent about one-third of worldwide figures, but 
underlying growth potential is huge and the trading firms have 
reached the assessment that "they have no choice but to boost 
their revenue in Asia." Such moves by trading firms are likely 
to continue into the future despite a trend to otherwise reduce 
overseas personnel assignments as a cost-reduction measure. 
  As of April, Nissho Iwai had 280 personnel assigned to the 
Asia, reflecting an increase of 34 (14 percent) in a one-year 
period. Total personnel assigned overseas is 548, a reduction of 
21 in the same period. The company has adopted a "strategic 
personnel" system under which it assigns individuals for a 
two-year extended temporary duty period as a means of handling 
the need to increase personnel in Asia. Overseas assignment 
expenses were normally absorbed by the respective divisions such 
as steel and machinery in the past, but since such an approach 
would not allow for major increases in overseas assignments, the 
expenses are now accounted for in the company overhead category. 
  Increases are noticeable in China, where the staff has been 
increased by 13 to 49. Staffing in Vietnam has been roughly 
doubled to 21, the largest for an integrated trading company. 
The company has opened an office staffed with local personnel at 
the Pun Tao oil transmission station in southern Vietnam which 
is engaged in the development of energy resources. Personnel 
have also been assigned to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyztan. 
  Sumitomo increased Asia region staffing to 209 (20 percent) 
in one year. Increased staffing included 13 for China, five each 
for Thailand and Indonesia, and three each for Hong Kong and 
Vietnam. The additional personnel were noticeable in the 
industrial infrastructure area and handle items such as plants, 
communications, electronics, and aircraft. Half of the overseas 
assignment expenses were charged to headquarters in order to 
alleviate the burden on each of the operating divisions. A vice 
president was placed in charge of the Asia region to strengthen 
control over regional activities. 
  Marubeni increased Asian regional staffing to 266 or by 10. 
Staffing in Vietnam was roughly doubled to 6 in Ho Chi Minh city 
and 5 in Hanoi. Further, the senior individual assigned to 
Vietnam and India was raised in rank to that of representative 
director. 
  Other trading firms are making similar moves. Profits being 
reaped by the trading firms are sizeable in Asia, rendering the 
situation such that they will equal or exceed those being 
realized in Europe and the United States, where business has 
been declining.

  [Text] The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development 
Organization (NEDO) recently selected a contractor to handle the 
transfer of environmental technology to developing nations under 
the project titles of "model projects for energy conservation" 
and "projects to assist in the introduction of coal utilization 
systems compatible with the environment." The energy 
conservation projects will be handled by five firms including 
Nippon Steel, while the coal utilization projects will be 
handled by seven firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. 
The respective firms have targeted fiscal year 1996 as the time 
by which they will demonstrate the commercial feasibility of 
technology for recycling heat produced as a by-product and 
removal of sulfuric contaminants, environmental technologies 
tailored for developing nations. 
  The energy-conservation model project will involve the 
effective use of heat generated in the use of coal at steel 
plants to operate power-generating plant boilers. Japanese firms 
to participate in the project will include Ishikawajima-Harima 
Heavy Industries and Chiyoda Corporation, in addition to Nippon 
Steel. 
  Coal utilization technology will involve the development of 
low-cost sulphur removal systems and high-efficiency boilers to 
be installed in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Technical 
development work will be handled by seven firms, including 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and 
Ebara Corporation.

  [Text] A research group composed of Honda Motor's research 
and development subsidiary Honda Technical Research Center and 
fellow researchers led by professor Morinobu Endo of Shinshu 
University's engineering faculty has succeeded in developing an 
electrode material which triples the capacity of lithium ion 
batteries which are considered promising as an energy source for 
next-generation portable electronic equipment. The development 
enables the absorption of lithium ion to a level three times 
that which was believed to be the theoretical limit in the past, 
providing for the fabrication of batteries that are small and of 
high energy density. Its potential applications include portable 
computer equipment and as an electrical energy source for 
electric vehicles. 
  The newly developed carbon material was synthesized by 
applying heat at 700 degrees centigrade to a synthetic material 
called poly (p-phenylene) with a series of benzine rings linked 
in pairs. Most commercially produced batteries contain a 
material which is crystallized graphite, but the new material is 
like an amorphous substance. 
  The electrical capacity of a lithium ion battery is 
determined by the amount of lithium ion stored in the cathode. 
The research group hardened the new material using a 
polyethylene binder, fabricated it into cathodes and immersed 
them together with anodes in hexafluorphosphate electrolyte in 
investigating its characteristics as a storage battery. 
  The battery was charged to a level of 1,000 amperes per one 
kilogram of electrode, enabling the discharge of 680 ampere 
hours at a one- to three-volt range. The electrical current 
density which indicates the discharge speed was recorded at 1.6 
milliampere per one square centimeter of electrode which is an 
order of magnitude faster than current batteries. An examination 
of the electrodes revealed no lattice images on metal lithium, 
confirmed the absorption within the electrodes of lithium ion in 
quantities equal to that reached when the battery is charged to 
a level of 1,000 ampere hours per kilogram of electrode at a 
one- to three-volt range. In the past, the chemical structure of 
lithium was such that the theoretical capacity was considered to 
be limited to 372 ampere hours. 
  A disadvantage with batteries using cathodes made of the new 
material is that it is not capable of producing instantaneous 
bursts of high voltage. Presently, only two times the 
theoretical limit of lithium ion is being used in charging the 
battery, but in the future, it appears that it will become 
feasible to use the full lithium ion capacity of the new battery 
as a result of determining characteristics of the discharge 
mechanism.

<F P=106> [Article by Katsuto Uchihashi, critic: "Cause of U.S.-Japan </F>
Economic Framework Failure"] 
  [Excerpts] Public opinion that the "United States is 
wrong" is being molded through clever manipulation of 
information and using that public opinion as a support, 
diplomatic negotiations are being conducted high-handedly under 
bureaucratic leadership. The end result of repeated policy 
failures was the recent "rupture." 
<H5>  Is Japan a Practitioner of Free Trade? </H5>
  The economic framework talks at the U.S.-Japan summit 
meeting 
failed to come to an agreement. Japanese bureaucrats' opposition 
to "numerical targets" proposed by the U.S. side was stubborn 
and the position of flat refusal was maintained throughout. 
  Subsequently, the U.S. side presented the new concept of 
"objective criteria," which might be construed as a compromise 
plan, but an opening for a breakthrough in U.S.-Japan 
negotiations could not be found. 
  With respect to numerical targets and objective criteria 
proposed by the U.S. side, details of either or differences 
between them are not altogether clear. 
  If significant points of benchmarks or objective criteria 
are 
to be summarized, it would probably be as described below. 
  If an agreement is reached between the United States and 
Japan on numerical targets, the numbers would exert some form of 
a binding power on the Japanese side. If targets are not 
reached, Japan must be prepared for the U.S. side to apply 
sanctions--at least, that is the Japanese interpretation. 
  As for the latter objective criteria, it is interpreted as a 
proposal to establish standards to measure the extent of 
achievements, i.e., how much progress has been actually made 
toward the goals. 
  With respect to both, the Japanese side resisted, claiming 
establishment of numerical values woud lead to managed trade, 
and the result was the issuance of a joint statement that an 
agreement without substance would be meaningless. 
  The Japanese side, which refuses to accept numerical targets 
or objective criteria, claims that the universal principle of 
"free trade" justifies its stand. Meanwhile, Japan staged a 
counterplay by bringing up deregulation as a domestic 
development at the summit meeting and tried to gain the 
understanding of the U.S. side toward Hosokawa regime's 
political posture. The Hosokawa government, which is trying to 
break away from the bureaucracy-led structure, decided that 
acceptance of numerical targets or objective criteria would run 
counter to the deregulation move and strengthened its strategy 
to reject numerical targets. 
  The reasoning was that the government and administration 
must 
intervene in the private sector's corporate activities to reach 
numerical targets, which would help preserve bureaucratic 
leadership in Japan, and ultimately, that might become a factor 
to obstruct the surplus reduction demanded by the U.S. side. 
  However, the two reasons given, free trade and deregulation, 
were not convincing arguments. 
  On the one hand, Japan had been asserting that "our markets 
are fully open already." Japan's position is that since it is a 
practitioner of free trade, it can tell other countries to 
protect free trade. If that were not true, it cannot reject U.S. 
demands on the grounds that they would jeopardize free trade. 
  Actually, however, over 11,000 regulations, mainly 
concerning 
permits and licenses, are being enforced in Japan. That is why 
deregulation becomes necessary and from the U.S. standpoint, 
such a market cannot be considered as free and open. 
  Japan's huge trade surplus of $140 billion is also seen as 
nothing more than the result produced by the extensive 
regulations and the "market structure" protected by those 
regulations. 
  The U.S. thinking is that only a market in which consumers 
have free access to all products and services and can select 
what is desired at fair prices is deserving of the label of free 
trade. And what is obstructing that is the network of 
regulations extending in all directions. 
  In other words, it means that the fact Japan has finally 
opted to grapple with deregulation, 10 odd years after the 
United States, certifies the reality that the market is not free. 
  If that is so, the U.S. argument becomes plausible that to 
make the deregulation course set by the Hosokawa regime 
effective and to advance market liberalization steadily, 
numerical targets proposed by the United States should, instead, 
be accepted. 
  The reasoning is that numerical targets are needed for the 
very purpose of pushing "deregulation." 
  The subject of deregulation brought up by the Japanese side 
ultimately left a strong feeling of distrust on the U.S. side 
that it was an excuse to reject numerical targets. 
  This is only one example. 
  In view of the grave realities--the extreme U.S.-Japan trade 
imbalance and excessive accumulation of trade surpluses against 
one country--it must be said that both of the arguments, one for 
free trade as a universal principle and the other for 
deregulation as a specific factor, were truly lacking in 
persuasive power. 
  The summit conference was applauded domestically on the 
grounds that "Japan said `no'" for the first time to U.S. 
proposals, but the results are clearly different from such 
self-adulatory evaluations as "a step toward maturity" or 
"adultlike relationships." 
  In the assessment of the summit meeting's results, a 
perception gap that is deeper than ever before emerged between 
U.S. and Japanese authorites concerned and that is intensifying 
mutual distrust. 
  In effect, that is the emergence of a new crisis. 
  The underlying basis of recent developments, where one side 
pressured with numbers and the other refused throughout from the 
very beginning, is the "U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement" 
signed in September 1986. 
  While the Japanese side said that it did not want to repeat 
the mistake like the one made at the time of the semiconductor 
agreement, the U.S. side pressured Japan for agreement on 
numerical targets using the semiconductor agreement as the text 
of a successful case. 
  The semiconductor agreement is an extreme example where 
interests and assessments are exactly the opposite depending on 
the position. 
  Then, what did happen in the course of U.S.-Japan relations? 
<H5>  U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement Is Starting Point of </H5>
Frictions 
  The "U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement" was signed in 
Washington, D.C., in September 1986. 
  Although a lengthy period of seven and a half years have 
passed since the signing, the circumstances surrounding the 
conclusion of the agreement live on as a history of unpleasant 
quarrels which still constrain both the United States and Japan. 
  A number of facts, which were not known during the turbulent 
agreement negotiations, have become clear now. 
  What happened before and after the signing of the 
"semiconductor agreement," which might be called the starting 
point of U.S.-Japan frictions, must be reexamined. 
  It is still fresh in our memories, but in April 1987 only 
seven months after the signing of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor 
Agreement, the U.S. Government applied sanctions against Japan 
on grounds that the agreement was being violated. There was a 
notification, then imposition of the expected levy of 
100-percent retaliatory duties on Japanese-made personal 
computers, power tools, and color TV sets. 
  The action was viewed by the Japanese Government, 
administration, and semiconductor circle as a one-sided 
retaliation carried out in too short a period after conclusion 
of the agreement. Opposition heightened against "the 
unreasonable United States." 
  Two months prior to the U.S. Government's decision to apply 
sanctions, MOSS (Market-Oriented Sector Selective) talks had 
been held in Tokyo. 
  Reportedly, at the meeting, U.S. representatives criticized 
the Japanese response with an unusually tough attitude, 
complaing that "the semiconductor agreement was not producing 
positive results," and moreover, left the meeting midway. 
  Numerous questions were raised and conjectures were made as 
to what sections in the agreement the U.S. side was referring to 
when it said, "there were no practical results" and what were 
the underlying reasons for such tough complaints? [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the notice delivered to the Japanese Government 
at the time, the date of implementation was set as 17 April 
[1987]. In response to the request of the Japanese side which 
wanted to avoid sanctions, an emergency U.S.-Japan meeting was 
held hastily in Washington. [passage omitted] 
  The basic perception of the Japanese representatives leaving 
for the emergency meeting was, "the notice of imposing 
retaliatory duties on Japan was a characteristic pose of the 
United States." Both the government and the semiconductor circle 
had the same perception regarding this development. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Japanese side, which believed that "retaliatory tariff 
levy was only a pose of the United States," set up a strategy of 
prolonging the itinerary of the U.S.-Japan emergency meeting and 
hopefully, snarl the discussions until the scheduled activation 
date of 17th. The calculation was if that happened, "the 
counterpart would back down and something can be worked out." 
  However, the U.S.-Japan emergency meeting ended woefully. 
[passage omitted] 
  When the "allegation of pose" that the "retaliatory duty" 
was 
nothing more than a threat broke down, the Japanese Government 
turned about and endeavored to publicize its "appeal to GATT," 
while simultaneously, it kept informing the mass media of "an 
outlook for early withdrawal." 
  "With respect to the United States, which resorted to 
unreasonable measures that can be construed as denial of free 
trade, we will say what we have to and appeal to world opinion 
by fighting in an official arena." 
  On the day the notice of retaliatory duty levy was 
announced, 
all of the Japanese newspapers reported, "the counteraction is 
appeal to GATT." Day after day even after that, the item, "GATT 
appeal," headlined the news. 
  The Japanese Government's response was seen as "fair and 
square counteraction" and public opinion swelled that "United 
States was the wrong party." [passage omitted] 
  During the course of developments leading to the retaliatory 
tariff levy, the schema of "high-handed United States and 
victimized Japan" had been imbedded in the memories of many 
Japanese. 
  The schema stirred up the people from time to time, as 
government leaders called for "GATT appeal," and the mood that 
statements urging cooperation with the United States indicated a 
weak-kneed diplomacy grew in the public sentiment. 
  However, what was behind the seemingly one-sided U.S. levy 
of 
retaliatory duties? There were too many facts which were not 
revealed to the people at the time. 
<H5>  Hidden Side of Semiconductor Agreement </H5>
  All government officials now say that they do not want to 
repeat the folly of the semiconductor agreement. 
  Harsh words, such as retaliation and sanction, are 
constantly 
bantered about to press for observance of the agreement terms. 
Troubles between the United States and Japan do not cease over 
the 20-percent Japanese market share of foreign-made 
semiconductors. The figure of 20 percent, which was intended not 
as a promise but a goal to strive for, has become an isolated 
target and only Japan has shouldered a heavy burden. 
  The United States is the unjust party. This thought runs 
deep 
in the public sentiment. 
  However, one cannot say that details about U.S.-Japan 
relations concerning trade and economic frictions have been 
reported in full, accurately and objectively, to the people on 
all occasions. 
  What was the extent of the people's knowledge about the real 
situation surrounding the semiconductor agreement? 
  For example, the U.S. retaliatory action was taken because 
"the semiconductor agreement was not producing positive results." 
  Various explanations were given as to why sanctions were 
applied in so short a time after the agreement was concluded. 
  There was the version that, "Obligations which were 
considered difficult from the start, such a price monitoring in 
Third World markets, were imposed on Japan. The United States is 
blaming us high-handedly because that has not been carried out." 
[passage omitted] 
  The message that, "we are fed up with the U.S.-Japan 
Semiconductor Agreement--we must not make that mistake again," 
permeated the bureaucratic circle and appeared to have gradually 
jelled into an unwritten, ironclad rule. 
  The "numerical allergy" affected not only the government and 
bureaucracy but the vast majority of the people and the 
Hosokawa-Clinton "summit conference breakdown" occurred with 
that as the backdrop. 
  However, there were many hidden scripts in this scenario. 
What did the people know and what weren't they told? There is 
an urgent need to reorganize the facts again. 
  In the first place, the problematical "U.S.-Japan 
Semiconductor Agreement" was intended to stop the dumping 
investigation of Japanese semiconductors by the U.S. Commerce 
Department and was concluded at the last moment, immediately 
before the start of the investigation, in exchange for its 
suspension. 
  At the time, on the basis of complaints from domestic 
semiconductor manufacturers, the Commerce Department was about 
to begin the investigation of suspected dumping of Japanese 
semiconductors in the U.S. market. 
  It was surmised, as shown by many precedents, that if this 
investigation proved dumping, there would not only be an 
imposition of heavy punitive tariffs, but there would be 
incalculable negative effects for Japanese mandufacturers. 
  A meeting was arranged through the urging of the Japanes 
side, which realized that the charge of dumping, to which the 
image and label of illegal trade would be attached, must be 
avoided at all costs. With the U.S.-Japan agreement that in 
exchange for suspension of the investigations, some form of a 
governmental treaty would be concluded, the negotiations finally 
began. 
  Doesn't the Japanese judgment that "it was more expedient to 
seek refuge in an agreement" reveal that the posture was too 
weak to attempt refutation of dumping charges? 
  "At that time, it was practically certain that dumping of 
Japanese semiconductors would have been validated if there 
hadn't been a switch to an agreement. It was a critical moment." 
A certain industrial leader now says so reflectively. 
  The semiconductor agreement was formed with these 
developments as the backdrop and, as a result, obligations Japan 
should bear such as, "prevent dumping," "free access to Japanese 
markets," and "monitor exports to Third World countries," were 
incorporated in the agreement. 
  Several years before the 1986 conclusion of the 
semiconductor 
agreement, particularly in 1984, Japanese semiconductor 
manufacturers rushed, at once, to make huge capital investments 
which can be considered excessive. [passage omitted] 
  The United States Trade Representative (USTR), who was 
disturbed by the investment rush, cautioned the Japanese 
Government that, "if excessive investments continue, there would 
be a supply surplus in the world's semiconductor markets and 
concern about export dumpings would arise." That was in 1985. 
[passage omitted] 
  Nevertheless, how many Japanese have an objective 
understanding of the circumstances which led to the U.S.-Japan 
Semiconductor Agreement? 
  That is the first point that should be considered. 
<H5>  Use of Confidential Letter as Makeshift Tactic </H5>
  Second, doubts remain as to how earnestly the Japanese 
Government and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) tried, after conclusion of the semiconductor agreement, 
to initiate actions to carry out the objectives and particulars 
stated in the agreement. 
  The dissatisfaction of the Japanese side, which had to sign 
the agreement reluctantly, is believed to have continued long 
after that. 
  As mentioned earlier, Japanese officials involved in the 
negotiations say despairingly, "price monitoring in Third World 
markets that is mentioned in the agreement was an impossible 
commitment from the start." [passage omitted] 
  Ten days after the MOSS conference in Tokyo ended in failure 
as mentioned earlier, MITI received a written notification. 
  "An improvement in the situation within 30 to 60 days is 
requested. There is concern that unless practical results are 
seen, the U.S. Government will be forced to take appropriate 
actions." 
  MITI began to act, finally. 
  It began to take steps to enforce administrative guidance, 
its forte, against the semiconductor industry. [passage omitted] 
  In the fall of the preceding year, simultaneously with the 
effectuation of the semiconductor agreement, MITI had proposed a 
"uniform 20-percent production cut" (256K DRAM's) as an 
administrative guidance measure. [passage omitted] 
  However, the attempt failed and the administrative guidance 
was not heeded. The reason is that the industry's leading 
corporations strongly objected to the market share. 
  Receiving the harsh notification after the MOSS conference, 
MITI was shocked by the tough U.S. attitude and started to 
reactivate the administrative guidance measure which had been 
suspended in midair. [passage omitted] 
  Seriously troubled by the U.S. notification, MITI was 
prodded 
by a sense of crisis and putting down the resistance of leading 
corporations on this occasion, ultimately succeeded in making 
the industry fall in step along the line of 20-percent decreased 
production. 
  The optimistic outlook of MITI bureaucrats that retaliatory 
tariffs would not be levied probably depended too heavily on 
successful implementation of the 20-percent production cut 
before that. [passage omitted] 
  However, the matters described above are still trivial in 
nature. 
  There is an even more important happening. 
  The third point that should probably be mentioned is the 
suspicion that the practice by officials engaged in U.S.-Japan 
negotiations to use makeshift tactics, such as handing over 
so-called "side letters" in secrecy from the Japanese people, 
was followed again in the semiconductor negotiations. 
  The problem is that they, who mention "appeal to GATT" on 
every occasion to create the impression that "we are just," have 
actually not only failed to carry out the GATT appeal but made 
the temporizing art of passing "confidential letters" to 
counterparts--unbeknownst to the Japanese people--a commonplace 
practice. 
  Is the statement, "to make the share of foreign 
semiconductors 20 percent," in the Japanese market, simply a 
goal to strive for or a promise by the Japanese side? 
  A fruitless dispute of "accusations" and "denials," 
involving 
the "side letter," which was not revealed to the people, started 
between the U.S. and Japanese sides over an important issue and 
is still continuing. 
  Was there a side letter or not? Explanations are given by 
Japanese officials through the mass media but no direct 
explanation of the incident has yet been given. 
  What should probably be feared is the posture of Japanese 
bureaucrats to arouse opposition among the people against the 
United States by saying, "avoid repeating the humiliation of the 
semiconductor agreement," while hiding important information. 
<H5>  GATT Appeal Is a Pose, Too </H5>
  As it is already known, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported in March 
1988 that it appears there was a "confidential letter" related 
to the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement (12, 13 March 1988 
morning editions). 
  Reportedly, when the agreement was to be signed, the 
Japanese 
side submitted a confidential letter, like the following, which 
was to be appended to the agreement. 
  "Regarding the attainment of the U.S. corporate goal to 
increase the share of U.S.-made semiconductors in Japan to 20 
percent within five years, the Japanese Government understands 
it, welcomes it, and will strive to support it." 
  The person who revealed the existence of the confidential 
letter was Clyde Prestowitz (presently, director of the Economic 
Strategy Institute), who was one of the U.S. negotiators at the 
time, and developments of that period are mentioned in his 
writings. [passage omitted] 
  Although Prestowitz has written that existence of the 
confidential letter was common knowledge within the U.S. 
administration, even with regard to very existence of the 
letter, the Japanese side has continued to strongly deny that 
"there is no possibility such a letter could exist." 
  Even to this day, the position is maintained that "what we 
do 
not recognize does not exist." [passage omitted] 
  In the "implementation articles" appended to the 
semiconductor agreement, with respect to "access to the Japanese 
market," it is stated that "the U.S. side desires that the share 
of U.S. semiconductors become 20 percent in Japan," while the 
Japanese response is, "we favorably acknowledge the request." 
  As far as the implementation articles are concerned, the 
word, "promise," is not noted, as the Japanese side asserts even 
today. 
  However, Prestowitz exposed that in the side letter, it was 
a 
"promise to provide support." [passage omitted] 
  That MITI hastily instituted administrative guidance to 
reduce production, after receiving notification following the 
Tokyo MOSS conference, was reported earlier. The administrative 
guidance at that time directed a production cut of 20 percent. 
  Doesn't this figure correspond to the figure in the 
commitment to the United States that, "we promise to provide 
support so that the share of U.S. semiconductions will increase 
to 20 percent?" 
  Too many evidences to disprove the denial that a side letter 
existed. 
  A number of points can be raised regarding the foregoing 
developments. 
  First, there is the suspicion that for a long period on the 
stage of diplomatic negotiations, information was manipulated 
cleverly through use of this type of skillful maneuvering. 
Public opinion is formed without factual basis and diplomatic 
negotiations are conducted independently by the bureaucracy with 
the public opinion as a support. 
  If the side letter, reported to have been exchanged during 
the semiconductor negotiations, had not been exposed by a U.S. 
negotiator nor revealed by the mass media, the Japanese people 
would have been totally uninformed and might have been mobilized 
into a more intense and a larger scale opposition against "the 
wrongful United States." 
  What happened eventually is apparent. 
  That statements by Japanese bureaucrats of "justice is on 
our 
side" amount to only mimicries is shown in the pose assumed of 
shouting for "appeal to GATT" in every trade negotiation. 
  To oppose imposition of the semiconductor retaliatory 
duties, 
the Japanese Government resorted to GATT. However, the appeal 
was based on "GATT Article 23, Section 1" and not on "Article 
23, section 2." There is a big difference between sections 1 and 
2. 
  Section 1 refers to "bilateral meetings" between parties 
involved in the conflict. This is a request to "reopen once 
again" negotiations that have ruptured while Section 2 makes the 
conflict official by establishing a panel (subcommittee for 
multilateral meetings) and seeks adjudication. Countries 
involved are hauled to a court, so to speak, and the conflict is 
disclosed in an international setting. 
  With regard to the semiconductor retaliatory tariffs, the 
Japanese Government did not ask for panel meetings subsequently 
and failed to protest the action at GATT executive meetings 
since 1988. 
  That is truly an example of mimesis. 
  Through these developments, the distrust of U.S. side 
deepened that "the Japanese Government makes a number of 
promises, but it does not try to fulfill the promises," and the 
accumulation of distrustful feelings led to the request for 
establishment of "numerical targets" and "objective criteria." 
  It is simple to discuss the propriety of these U.S. demands, 
but it is probably very difficult for the Japanese side to 
evaluate the past developments and take the initiative to 
present more effective solutions for the trade imbalance. 
<H5>  "Japan's Surplus" as a Global Problem </H5>
  An economists' group in Japan, numbering well over a hundred 
persons, agreed to oppose "numerical targets" and their views 
were consolidated. As though in response, in the United States, 
just as many scholars have taken a similar action. They claim 
that the establishment of numerical targets is a denial of "free 
trade" and will lead to "managed trade." 
  Not only economists but leading members of international 
organs, including the OECD, are sounding alarms about the U.S. 
proposal whenever the occasion arises. 
  As though they gained allies, Japanese mass media are making 
efforts to present, at every opportunity, arguments opposing 
"numerical targets." 
  Meanwhile, in Japan, "arguments pardoning trade surpluses," 
as presented in the Komiya doctrine (theory of Ryutaro Komiya, 
Aoyama Gakuin University professor), have emerged and he is 
being treated as a savior at Kasumigaseki. 
  Komiya asserts that, "the Maekawa report proposed reduction 
of the surplus on the assumption that Japan's current account 
surplus would hurt other countries," but that was a mistake in 
the first place. 
  He concludes that, "Perhaps, to cope with the mass 
psychology 
of other countries' general public, politicians, and mass media, 
which do not understand logic based on economic rationality, 
unreasonable arguments had to be accepted" (4 December 1993 
issue of SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI). 
  He claims that the structural cause of trade imbalance is 
the 
difference between total savings and total investments and that 
the gap equates to current account surplus in the long run so 
the huge Japanese surplus against the United States is unrelated 
to the issue of Japanese market closure. 
  According to Komiya's theory, the U.S. current account 
deficit is due mainly to the fact that savings are too meager in 
the United States and all of the Japanese efforts to reduce the 
surplus are fruitless. 
  The 1993 "White Paper on International Trade" was compiled 
on 
the basis of this line of thinking. 
  Kasumigaseki's opposition to the establishment of "numerical 
targets," which showed a monolithic unity centered on 
MITI-Finance Ministry bureaucracy, was probably encouraged 
greatly by the remarks of thse scholars. 
  These developments should have foreshadowed the rupture in 
Clinton- Hosokawa talks. 
  However, a close examination of the strikingly similar 
theories on the causal relations of the surplus reveals that the 
assertions are not necessarily uniform as to whether Japan's 
trade surplus, which is steadily climbing year after year, is a 
matter that can or cannot be afforded to be left alone. 
  The views of Lester Thurow, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology professor, are entirely different from the above 
theories. 
  "If Japan continues to record trade surpluses as it is, the 
world economy cannot keep functioning. No country will be able 
to bear the limitless increase in debts to Japan." 
  From the standpoint of a country's finances, the expansion 
of 
foreign liabilities means an increase in loans from overseas. 
Countries burdened with huge debts must allocate the people's 
tax money to loan repayments, and undoubtedly, national strength 
will decline and taxpayers will be impoverished. 
  At the OECD ministerial meeting held in Paris in May 1993, 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen stated, "Japan's surplus is 
obstructing the world's growth. This is a global problem." 
  If economics is a science which refers to such basic 
understanding as the "mass psychology of various countries' 
general public, politicians, and mass media which do not 
understand the logic based on economic rationality," it is no 
longer a social science that can set forth a guiding principle 
for the present-day society. 
  That is like a game of seeking "conformation of vain logical 
reasoning" that has nothing to do with what the world is 
suffering from and agonizing over to resolve. Is it possible for 
a country to pursue stability and security supported by such a 
game? 
  Japan's surplus stems from excessive savings. Komiya's 
theory 
does not differ from other expostulations regarding this point. 
Why do savings become excessive? Is it a problem that should be 
solved or conversely, is it desirable? 
  The reason Japan has excessive savings is that people are 
striving to save because of future uncertainty and high land and 
housing prices. To prepare for that, the establishment of a 
system to actually circulate the savings being made to build up 
assets should be the first step. 
  The government should aggressively encourage savings to 
build 
up assets indispensable for a secure livelihood and also, 
undertake a program of "reverse income transfer" of the savings. 
  After a certain period, the savings would be directed to 
housing construction as a form of building up assets. This will 
eventually create domestic demand which will ensure stable 
growth for the Japanese economy and savings will drop to a 
reasonable level. That will lead to surplus reduction. Such a 
policy must be adopted. 
  To "say what should be said" is the most important behavior 
in the international society. 
  However, the utmost consideration is that statements made 
under such circumstances must be rational arguments that are 
persuasive and convincing to counterpart negotiators. Otherwise, 
they could lead to a power confrontation or become irrefutable 
even they are taken as threats made by the weaker side. 
  It can be seen that the real cause of the U.S.-Japan split 
is 
not as prosaic as reported publicly.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 24 -- A delegation of Ho Chi Minh 
City led by Vo Tran Chi, Politburo member of the Communist Party 
of Vietnam, and secretary of the city's party committee has paid 
a working visit to China recently. 
  On May 21, Ho Chi Minh City's delegation was received by Mr. 
Hu Jin Tao, Politburo member of the Communist Party of China, 
during which Mr. Hu Jin Tao affirmed that the Chinese party, 
government and people have always attached importance to the 
development of the friendship with the Vietnamese party, 
government and people. He also expressed his pleasure at the 
establishment of the friendly, cooperative ties between Shanghai 
and Ho Chi Minh City and hoped that the relations would be 
further developed, thus effectively contributing to the 
development of friendship between the two parties and two 
countries. 
  For his part, Mr. Vo Tran Chi said he hoped that his visit 
to China will make contribution to promoting multi-faceted 
cooperation, and sharing experiences between each other, which, 
he considered, is very nessesary to build and develop the 
economy of each country and help consolidate and develop the 
friendship between the two countries. 
  Earlier, Ho Chi Minh City's delegation toured Shanghai and 
other localities. 
  It left Beijing for home on the same day.

  [Text] Soc Trang provincial authorities in southern Vietnam 
freed a Malaysian fishing vessel and its crew of 31 Thais and 
three Malaysians late yesterday. Malaysian Consul General in Ho 
Chi Minh City Mr. M.H. Arshad told reporters in Hanoi the crew 
and the boat can sail home today barring any further hitches. 
He said the boat owner had promised to the provincial 
authorities that he would settle the fines in full by Saturday 
at the earliest. The provincial authorities had fined the 
fishermen 108,000 ringgit after the Vietnamese Navy caught them 
fishing in Vietnam's territorial waters on 3 May. The boat 
owner -- who acted independently, bypassing diplomatic channels 
-- [words indistinct] 1,000 ringgit when he first arrived in Soc 
Trang to secure the release of his boat and crew.

<F P=106> [By Robert Templer] </F>
  [Text] HANOI, May 25 (AFP) -- A Vietnamese university 
professor and democracy activist imprisoned for 15 years has 
gone on hunger strike after being shackled for refusing to carry 
out hard labour, a human rights groups said in a statement 
Wednesday. Doan Viet Hoat, a former professor of English 
literature, was transferred from a re-education camp to solitary 
confinement in a prison for hardened criminals and denied visits 
from his wife after beginning the hunger strike in early April, 
Human Rights Watch/Asia said. The group said it was concerned 
that Hoat's health could have deteriorated and that he had been 
ordered shackled by the camp director. 
  Hoat, sentenced last year to 20 years in prison -- later 
reduced to 15 -- for "attempting to overthrow the government" by 
producing an underground newsletter, is in poor health with a 
serious kidney ailment, the independent group said. 
  Vietnamese authorities have transferred Hoat five times 
since 
he was jailed in May last year and he is now being held in the 
Thanh Cam camp in a malarial jungle area near the border with 
Laos. 
  Although Hoat's newsletter, Freedom Forum, called for 
democratic reforms, it did not endorse violent action against 
the government, the human rights group said. Hoat's wife, Tran 
Thi Thuc, has petitioned the government for his release and 
demanded access to him to provide medicines and food, the 
statement said. Thuc said she had travelled more than a 
thousand kilometres (600 miles) from Ho Chi Minh City to the Ba 
Sao re-education camp only to discover that her husband had been 
transferred to another prison. 
  "The entire journey involved a week of tiring travel and 
waiting around, yet I still was not able to see my husband for a 
minute," she said in a letter addressed to top government 
leaders. As Hoat had not been sentenced to hard labour, he had 
a right to refuse such work as crushing stones, she said. 
  "My husband has a severe case of kidney stones. My family 
has 
to follow his health condition closely," she said. "But while 
he was being moved constantly, we lost contact with him; and 
even when we located him we weren't allowed to meet with him, so 
how can we know he is in good health?" she said. 
  Human Rights Watch/Asia has appealed for Hoat's immediate 
release as he "is imprisoned in violation of international law 
for exercising his right to free expression." 
  The New York-based group has been strongly critical of 
Vietnam's human rights record, which as emerged as an issue in 
discussions with the United States on normalising relations. A 
recent State Department report gave Vietnam a mixed review, 
saying that while the 1992 constitution gave some legal 
guarantees of basic rights, political and religious dissidents 
were still being held for the peaceful expression of their views. 
  Vietnamese and US officials held talks in New York on the 
issue in March, but Hanoi has said that while it will welcome a 
dialogue on human rights it will not tolerate what it calls 
"interference in its internal affairs.

  [Text] The office of the Vietnamese National Assembly held 
an international news conference in Hanoi on the afternoon of 24 
May on the occasion of the opening of the Ninth National 
Assembly's fifth session. 
  The conference was attended by a large number of 
representatives of the foreign news media and by many press and 
cultural attaches from various embassies. 
  Vu Mao, head of the Office of the National Assembly, said: 
This time the National Assembly session will open on the morning 
of 26 May. According to the main agenda and contents of the 
session, deputies will study and pass a labor code; examine the 
draft law on domestic investment encouragement and four other 
draft laws; hear a government report on its activities in the 
first six months of the year; and discuss activities to be 
carried out by the National Assembly in the last six months of 
1994. 
  The National Assembly will also heard a topical report on 
its 
activities of the National Assembly, on foreign relations and 
managerial work -- and on the Supreme People's Organ of Control. 
It will examine and ratify the United Nations' Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, and so forth. 
  Asked by an AP correspondent about whether the labor code 
provides any guarantee for workers' right to go on strike and 
under what circumstances, Vu Mao said: The labor code has one 
point stipulating workers' right to go on strike. The purpose 
of this is to guarantee the rights of workers and employers as 
well. Of course, such a labor strike must not be allowed to 
effect the common activities of the community. 
  As for a question raised by a REUTER correspondent about 
whether the labor code stipulates the minimum wage for workers? 
Vu Mao said: The code of law in question does not stipulate the 
minimum wage. This is because a law can remain stable for a 
relative period, but the wage scale may vary according to the 
economic development situation in each period of time. If there 
is ever a need to stipulate the minimum wage, a by-law is 
suffice. 
  With regard to a question raised by a Cuban news agency 
correspondent about whether the National Assembly, while 
examining and ratifying the United Nations' Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, will discuss or make any declarations on the 
Truong Sa [Spratly] archipelago, Vu Mao said: While the deputies 
are examining and ratifying this convention, they will not 
discuss nor make public any documents on the Truong Sa 
archipelago. He went on: Vietnam consistently wishes to resolve 
the Truong Sa issue through peaceful and friendly negotiations 
with the countries concerned.

  [Text] Comrade Vu Oanh, member of the party Central 
Committee Political Bureau, just paid a working visit to party 
committees and people in Vinh Phu Province. Speaking to the 
local people and officials, Comrade Vu Oanh welcomed Vinh Phu 
party committees for their good implementation of resolutions 
from the central level in socioeconomic development and 
improving people's life. 
  Vinh Phu is a province that initiated the agriculture 
contractual system. Entering the new era of national 
industrialization and modernization, Vinh Phu needs to continue 
its renovation undertaking to create a driving force in 
production to further improve productivity and quality. The 
province should mobilize more capital from the public and 
provide guidance to the people so that they can use their 
capital efficiently to increase production and generate more 
jobs for the working people. With its potential, the province 
needs to quickly cover empty land and barren hills with greenery 
and plant more fruit trees and trees of high economic value. 
Vinh Phu should also attach importance to the improvement of 
education, health, and cultural service. It must consider this 
service one of the important factors in its socioeconomic 
development strategy.

<F P=106> [Article by Huynh Cong Hoa, vice minister of marine products] </F>
  [Text] Our country's seas have a rich and varied nature. 
For generations, the ocean has supplied our people with valuable 
items. "Golden forests and silver oceans" is an old saying of 
our people and a generalization about the rich nature of our 
country. Ocean resources in general and marine products in 
particular have always played an important role in the national 
economy and been viewed as one of Vietnam's leading economic 
sectors. Thus, exploiting, protecting, and developing our marine 
resources in conjunction with defending our national sovereignty 
at sea is extremely important both economically and politically 
and with respect to national defense and security. This is a 
large and complex problem. It is the task of the entire country, 
which includes the marine products sector. In this article, we 
will mention only a number of problems so that readers can study 
them. 
  1. A number of natural characteristics and the marine 
products potential of Vietnam. 
  Vietnam's coastline runs for 3,260 km, passing though 13 
latitudes from north to south. The ratio of the mainland 
coastline to the mainland area is rather high: 1 km:100 square 
km. The world average is only 1:600. Our country's various 
coastal areas differ greatly in terms of climate, weather, and 
hydrologic and crop systems. Our string of islands consists of 
approximately 4,000 large and small islands, which includes two 
large archipelagoes, the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa [Spratly] 
islands. There are many coral reef areas and many bays and 
inlets that provide good conditions for many types of marine 
products to live, grow, and reproduce. 
  The monsoons and the geography of the East Sea have formed a 
special ocean current system that reverses direction in accord 
with the two monsoon winds, that is, the northeasterly monsoon 
in the cold season and the southwesterly monsoon in the hot 
season. The coastal tides are very complex, because they are 
controlled by both the terrain and the ocean bottom. The area 
near the shore of the Gulf of Tonkin has a typical solar tidal 
system. The Thuan An (Hue) seaport area has an irregular 
semi-solar tidal system. Other areas have mixed tidal systems. 
The amplitude of the tides differs from one area to the next. 
The depths of the coastal areas vary greatly. Every year, there 
is an average of 9-12 typhoons in the East Sea and approximately 
30-35 northeasterly monsoon winds that influence mainly the 
northern and central provinces. 
  The above characteristics exert an important influence on 
the 
distribution of the marine products and on the harvesting and 
protection seasons. 
  On marine products: Based on many survey and research 
projects, Vietnam's marine products reserves have been estimated 
at approximately 3-3.5 million tons. Approximately 1.2-1.4 
millions tons a year can be harvested. Our country's marine 
products are rich and varied, and to date we have identified 
only about 2,000 species of fish belonging to many different 
families and orders. There are 1,600 species of crustacea, which 
includes about 70 species of shrimp. There are about 2,500 
species of molluscs and more than 600 species of seaweed. 
Besides this, Vietnam's seas also have many types of marine 
products of high economic value such as sea slugs, hydrophiidae, 
abalone, clams, rays, sea turtles, sea animals, and oysters. 
  Based on the different geological, climatic, and hydrologic 
conditions and different biological systems, our seas can be 
divided into four main zones: the Gulf of Tonkin, the central 
sea, the eastern Nam Bo sea, and the western Nam Bo sea. 
  2. The situation in exploiting marine products and security 
in Vietnamese waters. 
  As for the situation in exploiting marine products in 
Vietnamese sea areas, our country's fishing industry is a 
people's industry that is presently carried on mainly near the 
shore. We have approximately 68,000 ships and boats, about 80 
percent of which have been equipped with motors with a total 
capacity of almost 1 million horsepower. Of these, about 80-90 
percent are of small size of 40 CV or less. The harvesting 
industry is composed of 6 groups with more than 40 types, with 
the most widespread being dragnet fishing, encirclement, draw 
fishing, hook fishing, and seabed basket fishing. There are more 
than 300,000 fishermen and more than 500,000 people engaged in 
processing and rear service activities to support the fishing 
industry. 
  During the 10-year period 1982-1992, the country's gross 
production of marine products increased every year. In 1992 
production reached 721,681 tons, and in 1993 production is 
expected to reach 793,324 tons. In general, production has 
increased every year, but the new requirement is that quantities 
must increase constantly and, at the same time, the sources must 
be protected so that we can exploit these sources long into the 
future. Fishing activities today are concentrated mainly in 
coastal areas from a depth of 35 meters or less and to the 
maximum depth permitted (with bottom and surface fish). 
Approximately 80-90 percent of the fishing activities are 
carried on in this area. Thus, activities aimed at increasing 
fishing yields are being carried on mainly in depths of 50 
meters or more, particularly in deep-sea areas. Catches of 
surface fish can increase to 160,000 tons a year. 
  Today, the fishing industry is confronted by the reality 
that 
a high percentage of the marine products caught are not yet 
fully mature when caught. This is particularly true for shrimp, 
a number of species of fish, and mollusca having export value. 
This is a danger that must be dealt with promptly; otherwise, a 
number of valuable species such as groupers, lobsters, and 
"diep" face the threat of extinction. Along with this, there is 
the use of inefficient fishing techniques and tools. In 
particular, explosives are used to extract and kill many species 
of marine products, which destroys the ecological conditions and 
changes the growth and reproduction environments of the various 
species of marine products. In just 1992 and 1993, more than 600 
cases were tried involving more than 700 boats that used 
explosives to catch marine products, and [officials] seized 
7,685 kg of explosives, 544 mines, 14,884 detonators, and 1,046 
meters of slow-burning fuses. Environmental pollution is 
increasing because of industrial waste, waste matter emitted by 
ships at sea, and waste matter released by the oil and gas 
drilling platforms. Together with the destruction of the 
headwater forests, mangrove swamps, underground reefs, coral 
zones, and so on, this has had a great effect on the sources of 
marine products. Thus, the important and pressing problem today 
is to tie exploiting the marine products with protecting the 
marine product sources and protecting the environment. This is 
the only way to ensure an increase in productivity and yields 
and keep from exhausting our country's valuable marine products 
and ocean environment. 
  Concerning security at sea, to date, it can be said that few 
of our country's sea areas, particularly areas in our 
territorial waters and special economic zones, have been fully 
exploited. In recent years, disputes over sea areas and islands 
have been very complex, and this will continue to be the cause 
in the future. This is the case in two main areas, the 
northeastern sea and the southwestern sea. 
  In the Gulf of Tonkin, the Truong Sa [Spratly] Islands, and 
the Bai Tu Chinh area, many boats and ships of various types 
(fishing boats, warships, seismology ships, ocean survey ships, 
and so on) from various countries have regularly operated 
illegally, with the average being 20-80 ships a day. The 
situation in the southwestern coastal area is also very complex. 
  Foreign ships entering our territorial waters, illegally 
extracting marine products, and engaging in various activities 
for a variety of reasons is a very serious situation. Each year, 
foreign fishing boats illegally catch more than 1 million tons 
of fish in our waters, which is more than we catch. Also, many 
foreign ships illegally survey our sea areas, cause 
provocations, and threaten the safety of our oil and gas 
exploration and extraction activities. They also seize 
Vietnamese ships operating and fishing in Vietnamese waters. In 
1993 alone, foreign ships seized 152 Vietnamese boats and 249 
fishermen and 29 ships belonging to the Ministry of 
Communications and transportation and the Ministry of Marine 
Products. 
  The above situation is posing a serious threat to the 
peaceful working life of our people, threatening our security, 
and encroaching on our national sovereignty at sea. 
  3. Exploiting the marine products in conjunction with 
maintaining the security and sovereignty of the state in the 
East Sea. 
  From the actual activities of the marine products sector, we 
can see that the presence of Vietnamese fishing boats at sea, 
particularly on the open seas and at remote islands, has 
contributed to discovering, expelling, and seizing foreign 
ships, blocking their illegal activities in our territorial 
waters, and protecting the sovereignty and manifesting our 
ownership in the fatherland's sea areas. In past years, many 
local and central fishing units that have worked together in 
catching marine products have participated in discovering and 
expelling foreign fishing boats and a number of foreign boats 
conducting seismological surveys in the East Sea by "throwing 
nets" fore and aft or surrounding the foreign ship, which has 
had the effect of blocking or slowing the speed of the enemy and 
enabling border defense forces and naval forces to deal with the 
situation promptly and force them to withdraw. Naval groups and 
fishing fleets of the Kien Giang and Minh Hai provincial marine 
products sectors have carried on fishing activities and dealt 
directly with threats by enemy ships. They have also expelled 
and seized foreign boats that have encroached on our territorial 
waters. They have closely coordinated carrying on production 
activities with protecting production and maintaining security 
and national sovereignty at sea. 
  The policy of having people go to live and work on the 
islands having the necessary conditions is a good way to tie the 
work of catching and processing marine products to the task of 
protecting our sovereignty and security at sea. On the Chau 
island in Kien Giang Province, the policy is to provide help so 
that every fishing household can borrow money and to allocate 20 
million dong to build houses on the islands and buy boats. The 
fishermen there have responded positively to this policy. On the 
other hand, the infantry forces on the islands have implemented 
many positive measures to help the people build schools and 
medical aid stations and enable them to carry on production with 
peace of mind and become masters on the islands and at sea. 
Haiphong has a policy of encouraging fishermen to establish 
enterprises on a number of islands in the Gulf of Tonkin in 
order to carry on fishing activities. The Ministry of Marine 
Products has plans to invest in the material and technical base 
in conjunction with taking credit loans and borrowing money from 
abroad at a low or favorable rate of interest in order to build 
marine products processing installations and repair 
installations and to buy boats, ships, and other means 
(approximately 100-120 boats a year of 100CV or more). In 1993, 
on a number of islands, there were programs concerning 
investment capital. Based on the plans to expand the fishing 
industry in conjunction with the program to move people to key 
areas and islands, along with building marine products 
production installations, attention must be given to developing 
the cultural, social, communications, and information bases in 
order to stabilize the lives of the people, enable them to 
produce with their minds at ease, and protect our national 
sovereignty at sea and on the islands. 
  In conjunction with naval and other forces, the Ministry of 
Marine Products must organize things to bring fishing fleets to 
a number of important sea areas (such as the Truong Sa Islands) 
in order to protect the fishing grounds and ocean resources. 
What is even more important is that we must constantly have 
fishing forces in those places that are ready to coordinate with 
the Ministry of Marine Products in order to manifest our 
sovereignty and protect our national sovereignty at sea. 
  In order to maintain large fishing forces on the open seas 
and in remote ocean areas, the Ministry of Marine Products and 
the coastal localities must regularly organize things to enable 
the fishermen to take long-term loans (10 years), medium-term 
loans (5 years), and short-term loans (1-2 years) at a low rate 
of interest to build large boats and purchase fishing gear and 
have high productivity. At the same time, rear services and 
other services and product storage must be organized well so 
that the fishermen can carry on production in remote sea areas 
for longer periods. In 1993, fishermen on Phu Quy Island in Binh 
Thuan assembled a 55-boat fishing fleet, caught marine products 
in the Truong Sa area, and earned revenues of more than 3 
billion dong. This is a good example from which other localities 
can gain experience. To ensure that the people stick close to 
the remote fishing grounds, particularly those in important sea 
areas, besides the investments by the state and marine products 
sector in materials and techniques, naval and border defense 
forces must guide things closely, organize things efficiently, 
provide support, and provide protection so that fishermen can 
produce with their minds at ease. 
  The naval forces must also organize flotillas to make 
patrols 
and provide protection and also to catch marine products and 
provide services far out at sea. They must coordinate things 
with the fishing forces of the localities and marine products 
sector and create a broad fishing line on the open seas. Only in 
this way will results be achieved in protecting and exploiting 
our sea resources and defending our national sovereignty at sea. 
  The ocean fishing forces require centralized and unified 
guidance. There must be plans to organize and protect 
production. Every fishing group must carry out the fishing tasks 
and also help defend and manifest Vietnam's sovereignty in 
remote sea areas. Attention must be given to applying the 
experiences of the fishermen in order to formulate production 
plans and protect production. Plans must be formulated to 
coordinate things closely between the armed forces and the 
production forces at sea. The ocean lines of defense and the 
all-people's national defense and people's security front at sea 
must be solidified. Stability and safety must be maintained for 
economic activities at sea. International laws of the sea must 
be obeyed strictly, our national sovereignty at sea must be 
defended resolutely, and peace and stability in the East Sea 
must be maintained. 
  In order to carry out the tasks of exploiting, protecting, 
and developing the marine product resources along with defending 
the sovereignty of our state in the East Sea firmly, we would 
like to make a number of proposals: 
  1. Intensive propaganda and education activities must be 
strengthened for all strata of people, particularly for leading 
and managerial cadres, so that they clearly understand both 
international and domestic laws on the sea and have a deep 
understanding concerning national sovereignty at sea, on the 
islands, and on the continental shelf. Within this is the 
problem of exploiting and protecting our sources of marine 
products along with defending Vietnam's sovereignty in the East 
Sea. 
  2. The state should soon formulate a policy giving priority 
to investing in ocean marine products research programs in order 
to have a basis for making forecasts, guiding fishing 
activities, and effectively protecting the sources. 
  Investments in technical means and equipment and information 
must be increased for the forces engaged in protecting our 
sources of marine products in order to coordinate things with 
the naval and border defense forces in controlling the 
activities of the ships at sea. 
  4. Procedures and policies must be implemented to encourage 
fishermen to exploit the open seas and settle and work on the 
islands (give priority to them in making loans, give initial tax 
exemptions, build bridges and ports, and formulate cultural and 
social policies and procedures). 
  5. We should expand international cooperation, particularly 
with other countries in the region, concerning fishing on the 
open seas and cooperate in surveying ocean marine product 
sources and in obtaining and storing products.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Tuesday [24 May] expressed confidence in the outcome of 
bilateral "framework" trade talks after Japan and the United 
States agreed to their resumption, saying he believes the two 
countries will reach an accord. 
  "Not only Japan, but the whole world is watching. I am 
absolutely confident we will find a way," Hata told reporters at 
his official residence. 
  He also expressed optimism that the trade imbalance between 
the two countries will be rectified. 
  "Japan is determined to open its markets, and the U.S. is 
just as determined to sell here. I think all this is going to 
be interesting," he said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai showed confidence 
that Japan and the U.S. will come to an agreement before the 
meeting of heads of the two countries planned for July in Naples. 
  "There is no way we will fail with the conditions ready, as 
they are," he said, referring to the talks on "priority" issues 
-- Japanese Government procurement of medical and 
telecommunications equipment, autos and auto parts, and 
insurance business. 
  Noting that Japan's trade surplus is a major reason for 
resumption of the negotiations, Kumagai said, "We will make a 
big mistake if we lose sight of that fact," and pointed to the 
need for Japan to ease regulations to liberalize its market.

  [Excerpt] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- President Bill 
Clinton hailed the breakthrough announced Tuesday [24 May] in 
bilateral trade talks with Japan as "very good news" and a "big 
plus" to bilateral ties. 
  Clinton described the relationship between the United States 
and Japan as "an important part of our long-term strategy for 
peace and stability and democracy in Asia." 
  "I think the break there with the negotiations was a big 
plus," Clinton told reporters at a photo session with Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis. 
  The trade accord, hammered out during a post-midnight 
session 
Tuesday after four days of intense negotiations, commits the two 
countries to resume "framework" talks on widening access of 
foreign goods to the Japanese market. 
  The trade talks, held under the so-called "framework" accord 
the two countries concluded in July last year, have been stalled 
since they collapsed in February. 
  Clinton said he was "very encouraged" after talking with 
Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on the telephone Tuesday 
morning. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Clinton and 
Hata 
agreed, during the 14-minute phone conversation, the new 
agreement to restart the framework talks "shows that they can 
resolve issues and strengthen the relationship between the two 
countries." [passage omitted on U.S. officials' comments]

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The United States has asked 
Japan to include glass and lumber trade in trade framework talks 
with Japan, a Japanese Government source said Wednesday. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor made the request via 
telephone to Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, the source 
said. 
  Kakizawa refused to make lumber trade a new area in the 
framework negotiations, according to the source, who wanted to 
remain anonymous. 
  The two countries Tuesday agreed to resume the negotiations 
to hammer out new trade framework as a means to slash Japan's 
huge surpluses in bilateral trade. The negotiations, however, 
had stalled three months ago. 
  In the latest accord, they agreed to start new rounds of 
negotiations beginning with the three priority areas of 
government procurement, insurance as well as automobiles and 
auto parts. 
  Other areas will be discussed sector by sector if necessary, 
they also confirmed. However, Japan maintains the lumber trade 
has already been examined under separated talks and that Japan 
has carried out necessary measures to open up its market such as 
easing construction standards. 
  As for the area of glass trading, U.S. glass makers have 
called for wider market access to Japan. The two countries had 
two governmental-level meetings last year. 
  The source did not talk about Kakizawa's reaction to the 
U.S. 
request to include glass trading in the framework talks. 
  Meanwhile, at a session of the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee on Wednesday, Kakizawa said Japan did avoid the 
"objective criteria" in the framework talks from becoming 
"numerical targets." 
  The criteria are to be formulated as a means of assessing 
Japan's progress in overall talks. 
  Responding to a question raised by an opposition 
interpellator, Kakizawa said the objective criteria could be 
something like the number of foreign corporations or branch 
offices participating in the Japanese market. 
  Kakizawa quoted Kantor as telling him that several kinds of 
objective criteria will be set for trade areas to prevent 
misinterpretations about goals, which could prompt possible U.S. 
trade retaliation.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to the 
United States Takakazu Kuriyama said Wednesday [25 May] Japan 
needs to take steps to significantly reduce its current account 
surplus and implement a market-opening package to successfully 
conclude the trade framework talks with the U.S. 
  Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the 
upcoming U.S. visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, made 
the remarks at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. 
  He said Japan and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to get the 
deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides 
shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic 
and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall 
bilateral relations. 
  Tokyo and Washington also reached the accord because it 
deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade 
negotiations, he said. 
  Kuriyama said the greatest problem regarding economic and 
trade relations between Japan and the U.S. is that there is a 
lack of mutual trust. 
  Japan fears the U.S. will try to apply numerical targets to 
measure the openness of Japan's market and threaten sanctions if 
that target is not met, while the U.S. mistrusts Japan as a 
country always vowing to do something and then not, he said. 
  Opinion polls in both countries also show that trust and 
respect toward each others' nations are waning, Kuriyama said, 
attributing the reason to the failure of the framework 
negotiations in February. 
  The trade framework talks is aimed at boosting mutual 
understanding, he said. 
  Kuriyama, who is in Japan from Monday through Saturday, said 
he carried a message to Emperor Akihito from U.S. President Bill 
Clinton welcoming the imperial visit to the U.S. 
  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko are scheduled to visit 
the U.S. from June 10 to 25. 
  Touching on concerns abroad that Japan may come to possess 
nuclear weapons, Kuriyama said he tries to sweep away such 
concern by explaining Japan's nonnuclear position and the 
Japanese people's feeling on the matter. 
  The ambassador said it is impossible for Japan to possess 
nuclear weapons because an overwhelming majority of the people 
are against it and because Japan is a member of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and, therefore, has an 
international obligation not to possess nuclear weapons. 
  Also, not a single country among Japan's neighbors support 
Japan possessing nuclear weapons, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The United States has 
proposed an additional five areas of trade be upgraded to 
"priority" sectors for the bilateral trade framework talks which 
the two countries announced Tuesday [24 May] to resume, 
government sources said Wednesday. 
  The U.S. Government has suggested that financial services, 
glass, intellectual property, lumber, and antitrust policy and 
deregulation be added to the list of priority areas for 
negotiations. 
  Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging 
framework, are government procurement of telecommunications and 
medical equipment, insurance, and autos and auto parts. 
  The sources said the Japanese Government will basically 
accept the U.S. proposal, except for lumber. 
  The proposal was made during vice ministerial-level talks in 
Washington which led to the reopening of the framework 
negotiations. 
  The trade framework talks were agreed last July as a means 
of 
reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus with the U.S., but hit a 
snag in February this year due to a discord over a U.S. demand 
for "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese 
market. 
  The two countries agreed to reopen the talks Tuesday. 
  Of the five categories, which were all included in the 
original framework, negotiations over deregulation concern 
Japanese regulations over distribution. 
  The U.S. had suggested by February more than 40 items of 
changes in Japanese policies on deregulation and antitrust law. 
  For financial services, Japan has been asked to deregulate 
management of pension and pension funds. 
  The U.S. also wants Japan to make efforts to increase the 
share of foreign products in the Japanese sheet glass market. 
  Japan also has been pressed to harmonize its patents 
protection system with the U.S. patent system to prevent copying 
by Japanese firms of U.S.-made computer software.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japan did not face any U.S. 
demands for new macroeconomic measures at informal bilateral 
trade talks just concluded in Washington, a senior Finance 
Ministry official said Tuesday [24 May]. 
  During the talks, Japan explained the macroeconomic measures 
included in its March market-opening package aimed at boosting 
domestic demand, the official said, requesting anonymity. 
  The U.S. side "well recognized" Japan's efforts, he added, 
stressing that macroeconomic issues were not under negotiation 
at the informal talks. 
  The marathon four-day session focused on the three priority 
areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance business, and 
government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment, the official noted. 
  As for the insurance field, for which the Finance Ministry 
holds responsibility, the official said his ministry wants to 
resume talks as soon as possible although the schedule is still 
undecided. 
  Insurance negotiations will cover market problems in both 
Japan and the United States, and "qualitative and quantitative" 
goals instead of numerical targets to measure the progress of 
sectoral market access as agreed at the informal talks, he said.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO--Japan and the United 
States on Tuesday [24 May] announced a breakthrough in a 
three-month deadlock over framework trade talks that will "boost 
confidence" in the tattered trade ties between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bill Clinton hailed the 
trade 
accord in a telephone call after negotiators clinched the deal 
after four days of intense talks which wound up shortly after 1 
A.M. Tuesday. 
  "Where there is a will there is a way," Hata was quoted as 
telling Clinton during the 40-minute phone chat. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who announced the 
accord at a White House news conference, said he also talked 
with foreign minister Koji Kakizawa over the phone Tuesday 
morning and the two agreed to meet in Paris early next month. 
  Both Kantor and Kakizawa are scheduled to attend the 
ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development scheduled to be held in Paris on June 7-8. 
  Clinton and Hata agreed that the accord "shows they can 
resolve issues and strengthen relations between the two 
countries, and it will boost confidence between the two 
countries," Kantor said. 
  The heart of the controversy over the framework agreement 
concluded between the two countries in July last year centers on 
the so-called "objective criteria" for measuring imports into 
Japan. 
  The framework talks collapsed in February when Tokyo 
rejected 
U.S. demands which Japanese officials criticized as "numerical 
targets" for market shares of U.S. products in the Japanese 
market. 
  "The two sides agreed that the objective criteria do not 
mean 
numerical targets," said Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sadayuki Hayashi. 
  Kantor, while confirming that the U.S. is not seeking 
"numerical targets," emphasized that any agreement with Japan 
must result in "increased access and sales" to the Japanese 
market. 
  The U.S. will not accept "merely changing regulations and 
procedures" in Japan, Kantor said. 
  The agreement announced Tuesday [24 May] calls for 
negotiations to work out the specific language on the objective 
criteria for three "priority" industry areas -- Japanese 
Government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business. 
  Hayashi, speaking at a separate news conference in 
Washington, said the two countries have agreed to use both 
"quantitative and qualitative" yardsticks to measure progress of 
imports into Japan. 
  Negotiations on the three priority areas are expected to 
begin "as soon as possible," Hayashi said. 
  Kantor said the two sides also plan to begin negotiations on 
financial services, another industry covered by the framework 
accord. 
  Kantor said the U.S. also expects Japan to take aggressive 
fiscal measures to boost both domestic demand and imports. 
  The deal came two weeks after Clinton agreed to work out a 
common "basis" for restarting the framework talks before the 
Group of Seven summit meeting scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples. 
  The rupture of the framework negotiations at the summit 
meeting between Clinton and Hata's predecessor, Morihiro 
Hosokawa, badly soured bilateral trade relations and rocked 
global financial markets. 
  The agreement to restart the framework talks "will help 
improve our mutual understanding and mutual trust," Hayashi said. 
  Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, a key Japanese negotiator in the framework talks, said 
the new accord should "wipe out" the concern of countries in 
Asia and Europe over the trade frictions between the world's two 
largest economies. 
  The agreement announced Tuesday, however, marks only the 
first step toward anything like an equilibrium in trade between 
Japan and the U.S. 
  Japan's vast trade surplus with the U.S. -- the primary 
cause 
behind last year's initiative for the framework talks -- remains 
huge and growing. 
  Japan posted a record 59 billion dollar trade surplus with 
the U.S. last year. 
  Trade figures released by the U.S. Commerce Department last 
week showed Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. jumped 25 
percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- A senior Japanese Trade 
Ministry official Tuesday expressed appreciation for 
Washington's commitment not to use "numerical targets" as a tool 
to gauge U.S. access to Japanese markets. 
  Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director general of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry's [MITI] International Trade 
Policy Bureau, told a press conference that the United States 
had "clarified" its stance not to seek any numerical targets in 
future bilateral trade talks. He made the comment after Japan 
and the U.S. agreed earlier in the day in Washington to reopen 
the stalled trade "framework" talks, ending a three-month 
stalemate in the negotiations. "The restart of the framework 
talks will form a basis for further strengthening Japan-U.S. 
ties," Sakamoto said in a reference to the soured bilateral 
relations on the economic front since the rupture of the trade 
talks in February. 
  Sakamoto also said the accord between "the world's two major 
economic players" will have "not a small impact" on the global 
economy. "The latest accord marks Washington's confirmation that 
it will pursue free trade at a time when the global community is 
prepared to enforce trade measures pledged under the recently 
concluded Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks," Sakamoto 
added. 
  The talks to establish a new trade framework were launched 
after the July 1993 summit between then Japanese Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. But the talks 
came to a standstill during the Feb. 11 meeting between then 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Clinton when Tokyo 
and Washington failed to bridge differences over the definition 
of the "objective criteria" to be used to gauge the openness of 
Japan's markets. 
  Sakamoto said both parties during the latest 
subcabinet-level 
meeting in Washington refrained from defining "numerical 
targets. We are satisfied with Washington's first official 
pledge not to seek numerical targets," Sakamoto said. "What is 
more important than wording or definitions is to get the stalled 
talks rolling again," Sakamoto said. "Tokyo's understanding is 
that objective criteria will include a set of measuring 
yardsticks and they will be used on a sector-by-sector basis in 
order to gauge only how Japan has done in the past," he said. 
  He said Japan's failure to achieve certain goals would not 
lead to any trade sanctions. "If something wrong is found, we 
are ready to remove it to improve the situation."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, Chairman 
of Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp., welcomed reports 
Tuesday [24 May] that Japan and the United States have agreed to 
resume deadlocked negotiations for a new framework for bilateral 
trade. 
  "The decision to resume (the negotiations) is welcome, and I 
strongly hope constructive discussions will be made for the 
further development of favorable bilateral relations," he said. 
  Toyoda, however, said the automobile issue is basically a 
private affair and it is necessary for industries of both sides 
to join forces to arrive at a settlement. 
  Toyoda, who will become head of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren) on Friday, pledged that the 
Japanese automobile industry will faithfully implement its 
action program announced in March to steadily increase imports 
of auto parts from U.S. suppliers. 
  Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., said the 
Japanese industry will contribute toward settlement of the 
automobile trade issue between the two countries. 
  A senior government official said Toyota President Tatsuro 
Toyoda will call on U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale in 
a few days to discuss the automobile issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- A government panel is urging 
a dismantling of official curbs on participation by domestic and 
international business concerns in Japan's telecommunications 
and broadcasting markets, according to its report to be released 
later this week. 
  KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the report, compiled 
by 
the panel of three economists and an industrialist who are 
serving on the Information and Telecommunications Subcommittee 
of a government council on deregulation, headed by Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  The report says the government "should abolish or review 
restrictions on participation in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting fields, because curbs placed by the bureaucracy 
that forecasts the supply and demand situation contravenes the 
principles of a market economy." 
  "The government should eliminate a partition between 
international and domestic telecommunications operators," the 
report said. 
  At present, international telecommunication operators like 
KDD and domestic telecommunication operators like Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) are barred from moving into 
each other's turf. 
  The report also says the government should "authorize 
participation by local telecommunications operators in 
long-range telecommunication fields by allowing the local 
concerns to link up their networks with each other." 
  The report featuring these recommendations will be submitted 
for scrutiny and approval by Posts and Telecommunications 
Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa and other related cabinet ministers at 
their meeting, slated for Saturday [28 May], government sources 
said. 
  However, the report cautioned that unusually rapid 
deregulation in these fields might trigger confusion, urging the 
government to take precautionary steps to prevent a possible 
outbreak of chaos. 
  All or some of these recommendations will be included in a 
package of economic measures to be announced by the government 
in June. The pacakge is designed to eliminate possible seeds of 
conflict between the Japanese economy and the international 
community, the sources said. 
  The report also proposed changing a possible role of the 
bureaucracy from a regulator to a mediator who would "amend the 
imbalance between those with ample information and those 
without, while extending a helping hand to those who suffer 
disadvantages." 
  Demanding greater emphasis on consumers' interests, the 
report also recommended creating a "more flexible fee system as 
well as a system under which the benefits of a lower cost 
stemming from a more efficacious management could be passed on 
to beneficiaries." 
  It also proposed the elimination of a law regulating the 
operators of cable television, saying, "the CATV law that 
regulates operators' facilities and the contents of their 
businesses is unnecessary." 
  The panelists are IBM Japan Ltd. Chairman Takeo Shiina, 
Hitotsubashi University Prof. emeritus Kenichi Imai, Rikkyo 
University Prof. Masayuki Funada, as well as a noted commentator 
on economic affairs, Naoki Tanaka.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Tuesday [24 May] it 
has launched a new task force to expand Japan's role in 
enforcing new trade rules under the planned World Trade 
Organization (WTO). 
  Comprising such people as scholars, business leaders and 
journalists, the MITI panel is designed to coordinate Japan's 
views on a wide range of trade issues that may emerge under the 
WTO system, MITI said. 
  Specifically, the panel will study how to enforce WTO trade 
rules on the domestic front and clarify Japan's stance on 
proposed admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
by China and Taiwan, MITI said. 
  Newly emerging trade-related issues under the WTO, such as 
competition, the environment, labor problems and investment, 
will also be on the task force's agenda, which holds regular 
consultations twice a year, MITI said. 
  Recommendations by the panel could be consulted, for 
example, 
when Japan becomes a target of retaliatory trade tactics such as 
the United States' Super 301, a MITI official said.

  [Text] New York, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea on 
Tuesday [24 May] agreed with U.S. plans to go ahead with a third 
round of high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva in early 
June. 
  The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be 
more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing 
full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed 
the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special 
envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met 
Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau. 
  Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go 
along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and 
decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended 
last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the 
stalemate. 
  In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement 
on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future. 
  Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as 
the 
three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North 
Korea in the future, the sources said. 
  The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be 
forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if 
North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental 
nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang 
without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel 
rods. 
  Takeuchi told reporters that the three exchanged views on 
the North Korean matter, describing the current situation as 
"knotty," but added that if the talks can be held, "I look 
forward to progress" on the issue. 
  Takeuchi said that he had received no information that North 
Korea has halted its withdrawal of the spent fuel rods from the 
Yongbyon reactor as demanded by the IAEA last week. 
  Hearing that North Korea started removing the rods last 
week, 
the U.N. nuclear watchdog demanded a temporary halt to the 
operations in order to determine if any radioactive material had 
been diverted to military purposes. 
  A refusal to halt the operations could prove to be an 
obstruction to the staging of the talks, and according to 
diplomatic sources, Gallucci said that it would be a problem if 
North Korea proceeded with the fuel rod removal.

  [Text] Fukuoka, May 24 KYODO -- A Fukuoka travel agency is 
planning Japan's first rice-buying tour to South Korea next 
month when inventories of the domestic grain regularly grow 
short during the rainy season, organizers said Tuesday [24 May]. 
  Rice from the Ichon region southeast of Seoul is reputed to 
be as tasty as Japan's domestic varieties at about one-fourth 
the cost, said the Fukuoka branch of H.I.S. travel agency. 
  Overseas travelers can bring into Japan up to 100 kilograms 
of foreign rice annually under Japanese law and with Seoul about 
an hour's flight from Fukuoka, the agency is hailing the rice 
tour concept as a "bargain." 
  Tour participants will fly to Seoul and take a bus to Pubal, 
Kyonggi Province, some 100 kilometers southeast of Seoul, where 
they will be able to purchase rice from the local agricultural 
cooperative. 
  According to Kim Kyo-hwan, an official with the farm group, 
10 kilograms of rice will cost about 16,000 won or about 2,100 
yen. He added that the cooperative can sell about 30 tons of 
rice. 
  It will also be possible for the tour members to have any 
rice they cannot carry home with them shipped separately to 
Japan by the cooperative, the agency said. 
  According to the agency, Japanese tourists have brought home 
small amounts of rice from overseas as gifts for friends and 
family members, but its tour will be the first time that the 
participants will be able to bring home 100 kilograms, which can 
last an average family two to three months.

Trade and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [25 May] it will impose 
administrative punishment on two individual exporters for 
illegal parts shipments to China. 
  Katsuhisa Iida, owner of Traders, a trading company based in 
Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, and its president Norimitsu Sugiyama, 
exported a total of four image-enhancing tubes to China in July 
and October of 1993 without obtaining export permits, MITI said. 
The action constituted a violation of the Foreign Exchange and 
Foreign Trade Control Law, MITI said. The two traders will be 
prohibited from all export activity for one month from June 1, 
MITI said. 
  Image-enhancing tubes are used as components of viewing 
equipment for enhancing visibility in darkness, which could be 
converted for military purposes. Traders, a company which had 
specialized in business with China, folded in January this year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and Saudi Arabia agreed 
Tuesday to strengthen bilateral relations, Japanese Government 
officials said. 
  The officials said the agreement was reached at a meeting 
between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Hisham Muhyi-al-Din 
Nazir, Saudi Arabian petroleum and mineral resources minister. 
  Nazir, who arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a seven-day visit, 
handed Hata a letter from King Fahd and expressed hope that 
political and economic relations between the two countries will 
be strengthened, the officials said. 
  Hata responded affirmatively and thanked Saudi Arabia for 
its 
efforts to maintain stable oil supplies to Japan, they said. 
  Nazir urged Japan to cooperate on a joint oil refining 
project in Japan, which has been held up since last November, 
they said. 
  Hata was quoted as saying it is a private undertaking and 
the 
government hopes a mutually beneficial agreement will be reached.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Saudi Arabia's Minister of 
Petroleum and Mineral Resources Hisham Muhyi-al-Din Nazir on 
Tuesday [24 May] reiterated calls for Japan to resume 
negotiations on a joint project to refine Saudi crude oil in 
Japan, Foreign Ministry officials said. Nazir made the call in 
a 30-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at the 
Foreign Ministry, the officials said. 
  The Saudi minister, who is visiting Japan through Friday, 
made a similar request Monday during a meeting with Minister for 
International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata. 
  The joint project calls for building or acquiring several 
refineries in Japan to refine 45,000 barrels of Saudi crude oil 
per day for sale in the Japanese market. The project has been 
on hold since last November due to a policy rift among four 
Japanese partners in the scheme. The partners include Nippon 
Oil Co., Japan Energy Corp. and Arabian Oil Co. 
  Kakizawa told Nazir he wants to play the role of catalyst in 
resuming the project, the officials said. He was also quoted as 
saying Japan wants to strengthen partnership with Saudi Arabia 
in the political field along with economic cooperation 
relations, they said. 
  Kakizawa said Japan wants to contribute in humanitarian and 
economic fields as well as to the promotion of Middle East peace 
talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The government will likely 
review Japan's public service fee system, but Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata is ruling out tax money for highway tolls, the 
economic planning chief said Tuesday [24 May]. 
  "Almost all" cabinet ministers agreed at an informal 
gathering after the morning cabinet meeting to review the system 
in the wake of Hata's move last week to freeze all public fee 
hikes for the rest of the year, said Yoshio Terasawa, director 
general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). 
  Tuesday's gathering gave "the atmosphere" of an agreement, 
although nothing was decided officially, Terasawa told a regular 
news conference. 
  But he said Hata immediately ruled out an idea floated by 
Land Agency chief Megumu Sato to consider using funds from the 
general account of the national budget to offset some highway 
toll costs. Terasawa corrected remarks he made earlier, 
attributing that idea to Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato. 
  But Sato's proposed "project team" to review the public fee 
system is likely to be formed quickly, Terasawa said, citing 
more informal talks slated for later in the day. 
  He said the team would fashion some kind of report by the 
end 
of June, when the government has pledged to flesh out its 
deregulation and market-opening plans. 
  Kato, head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries, was one of the cabinet ministers who spoke in support 
of a fundamental review of the fee system, Terasawa said. 
  Other vocal supporters, he said, were Construction Minister 
Koji Morimoto, Home Affairs Minister Keigo Ouchi, and Katsuyuki 
Hikasa, head of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, and 
Eijiro Hata, international trade and industry minister. 
  But two of the most powerful ministers were silent, 
according 
to Terasawa. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Transport 
Minister Nobuaki Futami, did not comment, the EPA chief said. 
  In supporting the review himself, Terasawa said he wants to 
EPA [as received] to focus less on "price stability" and more on 
"lowering prices." 
  Japanese people must pay a proliferation of basic charges, 
and "for consumers, prices are too high," said Terasawa, who 
lived in the United States until recently as vice president of 
Nomura Securities Co. 
  He said the move to revamp the fee system follows the logic 
that Prime Minister Hata expressed in abruptly deciding last 
week to freeze the public fee hikes -- the government must show 
the public it is undergoing the same "thorough restructuring" 
that the nation's businesses have tackled in the prolonged 
recession.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone predicted Tuesday [24 May] that Japan will 
face "a political upheaval" in July after the passage of the 
full fiscal 1994 state budget and the Group of Seven (G-7) 
summit in Naples, Italy. 
  He said in an address to a Japan-China forum that Japan 
needs 
to shift from the unstable minority administration of several 
coalition partners. 
  But Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987, 
forecast that Japan will not return to the "pre-Hosokawa" era of 
government run solely by the Liberal Democratic Party, of which 
he is still a member. 
  Last summer then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition 
government ended the LDP's 38-year uninterrupted rule. 
  Nakasone called on North Korea to help end a dispute over 
its 
suspected nuclear arms program, saying a peaceful settlement of 
the problem would facilitate the start of normalization talks 
and economic exchanges between Japan and North Korea.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- Japan's former Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura suggested Tuesday [24 May] 
the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is likely to 
face a political crisis in July if the government fails to pass 
the overdue fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  Takemura, who heads the new party Sakigake [Harbinger], 
mentioned the Japanese political troubles during talks with U.S. 
Sen. Bill Bradley, suggesting that Japan's political situation 
will evolve under one of three scenarios in the coming months. 
  Under the first scenario, Takemura said, the cabinet would 
resign en masse after Diet passage of the budget, and under the 
second the House of Representatives would be dissolved for a 
snap election. 
  Takemura also mentioned a third scenario, under which Hata 
may hold onto power after the passage of the budget by forming a 
majority cabinet with defectors from the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP). 
  "If June passes without enactment of the budget bills, the 
minority Hata cabinet will face a difficult situation," Takemura 
said. 
  In Tokyo, Hata, in remarks to the lower house's Budget 
Committee, renewed a pledge Monday to seek passage of the budget 
by the end of the current Diet session on June 29. 
  Takemura, whose party left the coalition government in 
April, 
also said "the next several months will be difficult to predict 
and (there will be) times when Japan's politics will change even 
further." 
  Takemura served as chief cabinet secretary in the former 
coalition government headed by Morihiro Hosokawa, which captured 
power last August after 38 years of continuous LDP rule. 
  Due to the sudden departure of the SDP and Sakigake, 
however, 
Hata was forced to start his premiership at the end of April 
leading the first minority government since 1955.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Some 54.3 percent of the 
Japanese polled support Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority 
government one month after its inauguration, but 37.4 percent 
voiced disapproval, a KYODO NEWS SERVICE opinion poll showed 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Hata's cabinet, which could be toppled by an opposition 
no-confidence vote at any time, came in fourth place concerning 
public support for new governments since the first poll in 1974 
but is still far ahead of most Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
governments in the past. 
  Higher support directly after assuming power had the 
cabinets 
of former Prime Ministers Morihiro Hosokawa with 79.0 percent, 
Noboru Takeshita with 58.6 percent and Zenko Suzuki reaching 
58.3 percent. 
  Hata's disapproval rate, though, exceeds by 5.5 percent the 
worst results for the administration of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, last March. 
  KYODO's regular poll on political attitudes was taken in 
personal interviews nationwide last Saturday and Sunday covering 
3,000 men and women aged 20 or more. Respondents came to 2,055 
or 68.5 percent, with 47.5 percent of them being male. 
  Taking a closer look, support for Hata as prime minister 
appears rather shaky as more than one-third of his supporters, 
33.9 percent, said they backed him "for lack of another suitable 
personality." 
  Another 31.7 percent said, though, they trust the prime 
minister. 
  Of Hata opponents, 27.8 percent criticized the instability 
of 
his minority government, and another 26 percent said the prime 
minister lacks leadership qualities apparently reflecting the 
widespread notion that Shinseito policy maker Ichiro Ozawa pulls 
the coalition strings. 
  But while 16.6 percent had no confidence in Hosokawa's 
economic policy in the last poll in March, only 6.0 percent 
believe Hata's economic policies are no good. 
  Satisfaction with the economic performance of the new 
cabinet 
has obviously been boosted by Hata's freeze on unpopular hikes 
for public service charges. 
  Despite Hata's experience as finance and foreign ministers, 
voters' expectancies in these areas are only slightly higher 
than for the Hosokawa government. 
  Only 8.4 percent expect Hata to carry out political reform, 
down more than 10 percentage points from Hosokawa times when 
crucial reform bills were under deliberation in the Diet. 
  As for party support, the largest opposition LDP and the 
coalition defector Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ] have been able to turn around their downward trend in 
public support. 
  The LDP rose from 25.4 percent to 29.7 percent and the SDPJ 
recovered from 8.5 percent to 12.3 percent. 
  But while Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) made a 
2.2-point gain to 14.3 percent, Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) 
has lost three in four supporters who opted for the party during 
its prime last September shortly after Hosokawa's coalition 
ousted the LDP after four decades in power. 
  The JNP now stands at 4.6 percent, down 8.6 points from the 
previous KYODO poll, and seems doomed to play only a minor 
government role. 
  Support eroded also for coalition members Komeito, backed by 
the Buddhist lay organization Sokka Gakkai, and the small 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). Komeito's support declined by 
1.7 points to 2.7 percent, while the DSP has lost 0.6 point to a 
1.3 percent support rate. 
  Two newcomers founded by LDP defectors, Foreign Minister 
Koji 
Kakizawa's Jiyuto (Liberals) and New Party Mirai mustered 0.8 
percent and 0.2 percent in support, respectively. 
  New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], led by former Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, which supports the Hata government 
but refused to join the cabinet, slipped from 7.2 percent to 6.9 
percent. 
  The opposition Japanese Communist Party (JCP) registered a 
slight 0.1 point decline to 2 percent. 
  The portion of those who do not support any political party 
increased from 19.4 percent to 21.5 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's second 
largest opposition party restated a demand Tuesday [24 May] that 
the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata resign, 
while suggesting a new coalition government could be formed with 
a reformed Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
made 
the remarks at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. 
  "The cabinet should resign en masse so that an 
administration 
can be established that has a more stable foundation and has the 
confidence of the people needed to solve important problems 
existing both inside and outside Japan," Murayama said. 
  But he said the resignation should be put off pending 
passage 
in the Diet of the fiscal 1994 national budget bill and other 
related bills. 
  Murayama said that following resignation of the cabinet or 
after a snap general election, "the SDP would be prepared to sit 
at the table and make earnest efforts to form the new 
government." 
  He denied reports of a division of opinion between himself 
and SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who recently suggested 
the prospect of a coalition between the SDP and its former 
archrival, the LDP, now the largest opposition party. 
  "The SDP's policy direction is that we would not form a 
coalition with the LDP in the form it has taken over the last 38 
years," Murayama said. 
  By the same turn, he said, "the LDP must change 
significantly 
or else it will be unable to elicit the trust of the people." 
  Murayama also said the SDP and other parties must similarly 
change and consider that the best framework should be for 
formation of a coalition government. 
  He said the SDP is prepared to cooperate with many LDP 
members who say they value protection of the Constitution and 
democracy, and who make efforts to prevent corruption. 
  The present coalition is mainly formed by Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party. The SDP, 
which was the largest party in the previous cabinet led by 
Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the coalition late last month in protest 
against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group 
excluding it.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- A senior leader of new party 
Sakigake said Wednesday [25 May] the next general election must 
be contested under a new electoral system so as to elicit the 
trust of the people correctly. 
  "We firmly believe in the notion that the election must be 
contested under a new system," Hiroyuki Sonoda, the party's 
representative secretary general, said at a news luncheon. 
  Touching on mounting expectations of an early election, 
mainly within the two largest opposition parties, Sonoda noted 
that voters will have trouble envisaging the shape of a new 
government if the next election takes place under the current 
system. 
  "I think it is difficult for us now to ask for the people's 
judgment," he said. 
  Sakigake, a splinter group of the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), left the ruling coalition last month. 
  The Diet legislated in January a package of electoral reform 
bills replacing the current multiseat system for the House of 
Representatives with a combination of single-seat voting 
districts and proportional representation. 
  But it requires the passage of a bill that demarcates the 
boundaries of a new electoral map to allow the next election to 
be lawfully contested under the new system. 
  Speculation is rife that the administration of Prime 
Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, the first minority government in 39 years, will be 
forced to resign en masse or call a snap general election after 
passage of the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget through the Diet. 
  Questioned on Sakigake's stance on tax system reform, one of 
the most pressing tasks for the Hata government, Sonoda said 
hikes in indirect taxes will be inevitable to revamp the current 
system. 
  But he also spoke of the need for the government to seek 
broad public understanding of tax raises and carry out 
administrative reform to restructure itself. 
  On the breakthrough in Japan-U.S. trade talks, Sonoda took 
an 
optimistic stand that the current political confusion in Japan 
will not affect the negotiations to set up a new framework for 
bilateral trade. 
  While saying a stable political situation is desirable in 
resolving such a key issue, he said the current turmoil "will 
not be a stumbling block" because all political forces can 
easily reach a consensus in the face of national challenges.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network 
in Japanese at 1108 GMT on 22 May, in its "Sunday Project" 
program, carries a 37-minute interview with Yohei Kono, 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], by political 
commentator Soichiro Tahara. 
  Tahara first mentions a comment by Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is 
approved. 
  Kono says: "After the current cabinet resigns en masse, we 
have to look at the question of who will lead the next 
administration. We have to talk about whether we will be able 
cooperate with each on matters of policy. We are now working 
through our respective Diet policy committees to find out if we 
can cooperate with the SDPJ on Diet policy matters." 
  He is then asked for his thoughts on the next general 
election. 
  Kono says: "The next election should be held under a system 
of single-seat and proportional representation because we have 
promoted political reform this far. 
  "However, the problem is that we will have to hold the 
election under the multiple-seat constituency system if the Hata 
administration dissolves the Diet right now." 
  Tahawa presses Kono to explain more fully the LDP's plans if 
it forces the Hata administration to resign and then forms the 
next administration before a general election is called. 
  Kono Says: "It depends on the quality of the new government. 
Mr. Tahara, I think we can say it will still be a minority 
government if the LDP single-handedly takes power. We will have 
more Diet seats than the current administration and, unlike the 
current administration, we will be able to unify opinions more 
easily because it will be a single-party government. 
Nevertheless, it will be a minority government. This means we 
will seek the judgment of the people after making preparations 
for an election." 
  He is asked if the next cabinet, either an LDP one or an 
LDP-SDPJ coalition, will be merely a caretaker cabinet which 
looks after preparations for the next election. 
  Kono says: "Although it is important to seek the judgment of 
the people, I should not say at this stage that we would hold an 
election at any cost tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." 
  Asked to explain differences between the policies of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa 
and his own, Kono says: "It seems Ozawa is saying the people 
exist for the nation, that priority should be given not to the 
people but to national interests. We maintain, however, that we 
will build a nation for the people."] 
  On reorganization, which he made at a news conference in 
China on the possibility of returning to the coalition. 
  Asked what he thinks of Kubo's comment, Kono says Kubo also 
feels the current political situation, in which the country is 
led by a minority government, is abnormal and that the Hata 
cabinet should resign en masse. He also points out that Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, following Kubo's remark, hinted at 
the possibility of the government dissolving the cabinet if the 
SDPJ comes back into the coalition. 
  Kono then says: "As the chief cabinet secretary's remarks 
indicate, the current administration would do anything as long 
as it can remain in power." 
  He is then asked if the LDP will change its strategy if the 
SDPJ returns to the coalition. 
  Kono says: "The SDPJ is a big party, so there are many 
different opinions among its executive department members, 
including Kubo and Muryama." 
  Tahara then asks Kono to explain the LDP's strategy once it 
has called for a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet. Kono 
provides a lengthy critique of the minority government and its 
inability to manage state affairs, and says the cabinet should 
resign en masse immediately after the fiscal 1994 budget is 
approved. 
  Kono says: "After the current cabinet resigns en masse, we 
have to look at the question of who will lead the next 
administration. We have to talk about whether we will be able 
cooperate with each on matters of policy. We are now working 
through our respective Diet policy committees to find out if we 
can cooperate with the SDPJ on Diet policy matters." 
  He is then asked for his thoughts on the next general 
election. 
  Kono says: "The next election should be held under a system 
of single-seat and proportional representation because we have 
promoted political reform this far. 
  "However, the problem is that we will have to hold the 
election under the multiple-seat constituency system if the Hata 
administration dissolves the Diet right now." 
  Tahawa presses Kono to explain more fully the LDP's plans if 
it forces the Hata administration to resign and then forms the 
next administration before a general election is called. 
  Kono Says: "It depends on the quality of the new government. 
Mr. Tahara, I think we can say it will still be a minority 
government if the LDP single-handedly takes power. We will have

  He is asked if the next cabinet, either an LDP one or an 
LDP-SDPJ coalition, will be merely a caretaker cabinet which 
looks after preparations for the next election. 
  Kono says: "Although it is important to seek the judgment of 
the people, I should not say at this stage that we would hold an

and his own, Kono says: "It seems Ozawa is saying the people 
exist for the nation, that priority should be given not to the 
people but to national interests. We maintain, however, that we 
will build a nation for the people." 
  On reorganization in the political world, Kono says the 
system of two major parties proposed by Ozawa will not be able 
to meet people's demands. 
  "I think there should be many parties," he says. 
  Asked about revising the constitution, Kono says: "I think 
the time is not ripe enough to revise the constitution."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii was accused in the Diet on Tuesday [24 May] of making a 
controversial remark, calling the poor rice harvest last year a 
heavenly gift to aid the government's policy of reducing rice 
production. The accusation was made in the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee by Hiromu Nonaka, a member of 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Nonaka said Fujii made the remark in an informal meeting 
with 
reporters at his home last December. Nonaka also quoted Fujii 
as saying last year's harvest, the worst in the postwar era, 
spared the government extra efforts in working out ways to 
reduce the country's annual rice output by 400,000 tons. 
  Fujii also was alleged to have said no one in the government 
considers it necessary to subsidize farmers who convert their 
paddies to grow other produce because they will be gone in 10 or 
15 years. Fujii did not confirm or deny the allegation but said 
he wanted to stress the importance of the government's 
agricultural policy and political reforms.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry called 
for net tax increases to cover a revenue shortfall amid a 
graying society, according to a report issued Tuesday [24 May]. 
  The report, submitted to government tax panels and the 
ruling 
coalition parties, estimates Japan will face a budgetary revenue 
shortage of 8.9 trillion yen to 12.7 trillion yen in fiscal 2000. 
  Ministry officials told reporters that net increases in tax 
revenues are a necessary part of tax reform because fiscal and 
administrative reforms appear insufficient to cover the shortage. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said the panel 
acknowledged the tough medium- to long-term financial 
conditions. However, the panel is to make its own estimates, 
and revenue "neutral" is still one alternative for tax reform, 
Kato told a news conference after the panel's meeting. 
  The advisory forum to the prime minister is scheduled to 
prepare various alternatives with concrete figures for its 
regional hearings in early June. 
  After the hearings, the panel is to begin drafting its 
report 
for the coalition parties and the government to decide on 
promised full- fledged tax reform, including permanent tax cuts, 
by the end of June. 
  Kato said the ministry report poses various estimates that 
require the panel's further review, including in social welfare 
spending, bond issuances, tax revenues and economic growth. He 
noted the body will come up with more "realistic" alternatives 
by including in its estimates effects from extending tax cuts. 
  The report estimated 24 trillion yen for welfare spending in 
fiscal 2000, up from 14.6 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 budget 
plan, based on figures from a welfare vision prepared by an 
advisory panel to the Health and Welfare Ministry. 
  On bond issuance, the ministry projected 18 trillion yen, up 
slightly from 14.4 trillion yen, in line with its policy to 
limit the debt-to-expenditure ratio to 5 percent. 
  Kato said further discussions are necessary on appropriate 
levels of bond issuance. He also ruled out the elasticity rate 
of 1.1 and the nominal economic growth rate of 5 percent used by 
the ministry to estimate tax revenues. 
  Under the report, tax revenues are expected to increase to 
79.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2000 from an estimated 53.7 trillion 
yen in fiscal 1994. 
  Kato said more "natural" increases in such revenues can be 
expected with lower prices in line with deregulations and 
administrative overhauls to stimulate consumption. But panel 
members acknowledged the increases would not be enough to 
finance tax cuts and heavier welfare spending, Kato said. 
  On the economic growth rate, many panel members held off on 
any optimistic outlook, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The government plans to draw 
up a plan to double the real income of the Japanese people by 
lowering prices through such means as drastically reviewing 
public service charges, government officials said Tuesday [24 
May]. 
  The officials said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told cabinet 
ministers after a regular cabinet meeting, "from now on, we want 
to make lowering prices an aim. For example, we will cut 
(prices) by a certain percent, or something such as that." 
  "Just like a government project in the past to double the 
people's income, this time we want to draw up a plan to double 
real income," Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Cabinet ministers agreed to set up a project team to review 
the method of public service rates, the officials said. The 
group is expected to propose a plan on how to review the rates, 
they said. 
  The move follows a chorus of calls from the ministers for 
efforts to lower public service rates instead of simply freezing 
their hikes, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  At the day's regular cabinet meeting, Hata spoke of the need 
to boost the nation's real income while guiding consumer prices 
down, Kumagai said. 
  Last week, the government announced a freeze until the end 
of 
the year on planned increases in public service charges, 
including domestic telephones charges, public housing rent, taxi 
fares and expressway tolls. 
  It is the first freeze on public charges since 1974, and the 
first such sweeping freeze since 1964.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Despite a growing sense that 
Japan's economy is hitting bottom, "many minus factors still 
remain," Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Tuesday [24 
May]. 
  Mieno told the House of Representatives Budget Committee 
more 
time is still needed to judge if bright spots in the economy 
will overtake the bad ones and spread to a general recovery. 
  He said more "conditions for recovery" are falling into 
place 
now than a year ago, when hopes for a turnaround were dashed by 
the surging yen, bad weather and political turmoil. 
  Mieno cited such improving conditions as companies' progress 
in stock adjustments, the effects of government fiscal and 
monetary stimulus measures and increasing robustness in the 
world economy, especially the United States. 
  But he expressed continued concern over the effects of trade 
friction, the high yen and balance-sheet adjustments, such as 
the mountain of bad loans that financial institutions are trying 
to clear off their books. 
  He repeated that each country's monetary policy must be 
based 
on a "comprehensive judgment" of the economy and not such single 
factors as exchange or real interest rates. 
  As the U.S. has raised rates and Germany cut them, Japan's 
central bank has led money market interest rates to repeated 
record lows through generous market funding. Many market 
players infer the moves are coordinated and designed to curb the 
yen and prop up the dollar.

<F P=106> [Telephone message from the Secretariat of the Committee for </F>
the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, CPRF, addressed to 
the South Korean National Unification Board on 25 May -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] We send this message as authorized by a 
consultative meeting of representatives of the government, 
parties, and public organizations of the DPRK held on 25 May. 
  As your side knows, at the 11 April joint meeting of the 
government, parties, and public organizations of the DPRK, our 
side proposed convening a national meeting -- in which 
representatives of the authorities, parties, and organizations 
and individuals in the North and South will attend -- on the 
occasion of the upcoming 15 August [anniversary of liberation 
from Japan], a year before the 50th anniversary of national 
liberation. As an immediate measure to successfully hold this 
meeting, our side proposed forming a national meeting 
preparatory committee composed of five representatives each from 
the North and South and overseas and holding the first 
[preparatory committee] meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul sometime 
in May. 
  Our side has sent the letter containing this proposal to 
your 
authorities and persons concerned in South Korea via 
international mail because we could not send the letter 
containing this proposal through Panmunjom. 
  Our historic proposal for convening a national meeting was 
advanced out of a single patriotic desire to resolve prevailing 
difficulties, ensure peace in the country, and hasten 
reunification in the nineties on the united strength of the 
nation. 
  Our proposal for convening a national meeting wins greater 
support and sympathy from people from all walks of life in the 
North and South and abroad as time goes by because it is 
reasonable and realistic. 
  We acknowledge that your authorities have no reason not to 
accept the proposal for convening a national meeting, which all 
fellow countrymen hope for. 
  If the historic national meeting is convened, its convening 
itself will open a new stage of reconciliation and unity. We 
will be able to seek a joint way to realize the country's peace 
and reunification while opening each other's mind and achieving 
the grand national unity through candid [kitanopnun] 
consultations. 
  One should now throw away the idea of confrontation, with 
which one has shown unconditional opposition to a proposal, 
because it has been put forth by the other side. It is time 
that one should open the way out for the nation through joint 
efforts while sincerely accepting a proposal--if it is conducive 
to the country's peace and reunification--even if it is not 
one's own proposal. 
  We expect that your authorities will keep in step with us by 
selecting at an early date the South side's delegates to the 
preparatory committee for the national meeting as well as 
showing a positive response to the proposal for convening the 
national meeting. 
  Also, availing ourselves of this opportunity, we are 
informing you that the consultative meeting of representatives 
of the DPRK Government, parties, and social organizations, which 
has been held now, selected as the North side's delegates to the 
preparatory committee for the national meeting Chong Mun-san, 
director of the Secretariat of the DPRK State Administration 
Council; Kim Yong-ho, vice chairman of the Central Committee of 
the Korean Social Democratic Party; Paek Nam-chun, director of 
the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification 
of Fatherland; Kim Yong- nam, vice chairman of the Central 
Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea; 
and Kang Yong-sop, vice chairman of the Korean Religionists 
Council and chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean 
Christians Federation.

  [Text] A consultative meeting of the delegates of the DPRK 
Government, political parties, and public organizations was 
held. At the joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political 
parties, and public organizations which was held in Pyongyang on 
11 April, a proposal was made that a national meeting, to be 
participated in by the delegates of the authorities, the 
political parties, and organizations, and individual figures of 
the North and the South and the delegates from overseas, be 
convened in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of this 15 
August, one year before the 50th anniversary of the fatherland 
liberation, that a preparatory committee for the national 
meeting be formed consisting of the delegates of the North, the 
South, and overseas, and that the first round of the preparatory 
committee meeting be held in May as a measure for the successful 
convocation of the national meeting. 
  A consultative meeting of the delegates of the DPRK 
Government, political parties, and public organizations was held 
in Pyongyang on 25 May to discuss various matters connected with 
the convocation of the national meeting. 
  Participating in the consultative meeting were the delegates 
of the DPRK Central People's Committee, State Administration 
Council, political parties, and public organizations. 
  The consultative meeting discussed various measures to be 
taken at the present which include the matter of sending to the 
South Korean authorities a telephone message urging them to 
respond to our proposal for convening a national meeting and for 
forming a national meeting preparatory committee and the matter 
of electing the North side's delegates to the national meeting. 
  The consultative meeting pointed out first that the 10-point 
program for great unity of the whole nation clarified by the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is enjoying great support and 
sympathy among the people at home and abroad with each passing 
day and that the proposal for convening a national meeting for 
its realization has been evoking deep interests among the people 
in the North and the South and overseas compatriots. 
  The consultative meeting expressed deep regret over the fact 
that the South Korean authorities did not accept our side's 
letter related to convening a national meeting, which was 
proposed proceeding from the desire to open the road for peace 
and peaceful reunification with the nation's united strength, 
amid the circumstances under which North-South confrontation is 
being intensified and the danger of a nuclear war is growing on 
the Korean peninsula and that, furthermore, they went so far as 
to intercept and block en route the letter sent to individual 
addressees by international mail. 
  The consultative meeting has decided to urge the South 
Korean 
authorities to accept the proposal to convene a national meeting 
as soon as possible, taking note of the positive position 
expressed on 15 April by the preparatory committee to form the 
South side's headquarters of Pomminnyon regarding the holding of 
the national meeting. For this end, it has enabled the CPRF 
secretariat to immediately send a telephone message which urges 
South Korea to accept the proposal and to elect the delegates of 
the South side's preparatory committee for the national meeting 
to the South Korean National Unfication Board. 
  Based on the reaffirmation of the need to elect the 
delegates 
of the preparatory committee, the consultative meeting first 
elected the delegates of the North side's preparatory committee 
and those are as follows: Chong Mun-san, secretary of 
Secretariat of the Administration Council; Kim Yong-ho, vice 
chairman of Korea Social Democratic Party Central Committee; 
Paek Nam-chun, secretary of the CPRF Secretariat; Kim 
Yong-nam, vice chairman of General Federation of Trade Unions of 
Korea; and Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the Korean Christian 
Federation Central Committee and vice chairman of the Korean 
Religious Council. 
  Participants in the consultative meeting have expressed 
their 
firm resolution to open a new significant phase to secure peace 
in the country, as well as to achieve peaceful reunification 
based on the great unity of the whole nation, thus surely 
holding the national meeting on the occasion of 15 August of 
this year, a year ahead of the 50th anniversary of the 
liberation of the fatherland. 
  Also, they expressed the expectation that the South Korean 
authorities immediately respond to the proposal to convene the 
national meeting, and that the South side elect the delegates to 
participate in the national meeting at the earliest date.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Criminal Declares Joint Declaration on </F>
Denuclearisation Invalid" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- South Korean puppet 
Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku, taking issue with the 
North over its "nuclear issue", reportedly told the "Foreign 
Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly" on 
May 23 that the "North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearisation has virtually become invalid". 
  Announcing the joint declaration on denuclearisation null 
and 
void, he ascribed this to the North's "nuclear issue". This is 
the height of folly. 
  The South Korean puppet clique which has stockpiled spent 
nuclear fuel containing more than 10 tons of plutonium now is 
hell bent on the development of nuclear weapons, developing a 
fast breeder reactor to abstract a larger amount of plutonium. 
This tells that the South Korean puppet clique is entirely to 
blame for reducing the joint declaration on denuclearisation to 
a mere empty sheet of paper and for rendering the 
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula impossible. 
  The South Korean puppet clique's acceleration of the 
development of its own nuclear weapons is an intolerable 
anti-national, anti- peace criminal act of increasing the danger 
of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. 
  Facts eloquently tell that the South Korean puppet clique is 
a clique of nuclear fanatics who are not interested at all in 
the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but desperately 
stepping up their own nuclear armament under the nuclear 
umbrella of the United States in a bid to ignite a nuclear war 
and plunge the nation into a holocaust of nuclear war.

-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- The South Korean people 
entrust their destiny wholly to the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong- il, looking up to him as the great sun of the nation, an 
iron-willed brilliant commander and the lodestar of 
reunification. 
  A newspaper reporter Sin, in Seoul, said when talking with 
his colleagues about the situation: 
  "The dear leader Kim Chong-il with both literary and 
military 
accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander with an 
unshakable faith and a prominent master of politics with a clear 
judgement and outstanding leadership ability. 
  "He is an eminent leader of the international socialist 
movement who is guiding the movement for the reconstruction of 
socialism in the centre of the world politics, meeting the 
challenge of the imperialist allied forces with his matchless 
grit and iron will." 
  An inhabitant of Seoul, showing his colleagues a book 
entitled "Lodestar of the Age of Independence," said: 
  "To have a great leader is the highest honor, pride and 
happiness for a country and nation. 
  "Our people's highest honor and greatest happiness and pride 
is that they have sagacious Kim Chong-il as the leader of the 
nation. As we have him, the day is sure to come soon when the 70 
million Koreans will hail reunification." 
  A high school teacher in Seoul told his colleagues: 
  "The dear leader Kim Chong-il is possessed of rare wisdom, 
broad magnanimity and noble virtues. 
  "There is no such great man and prominent leader in history 
as the dear leader Kim Chong-il who enjoys undisputed trust from 
people for his trust, love and benevolence for them, motivated 
by his idea of `believing in the people as in heaven'. 
  "He is a great hero who leads not only a nation but also the 
entire world."

<F P=106> ["14th Anniversary of Heroic Kwangju Popular Uprising </F>
Marked" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies took place 
in different parts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
to mark the 14th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular 
uprising. 
  Mass rallies were held on May 22 and 23 in North Pyongan, 
South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and Kaesong municipality. 
  Senior officials and representatives of workers, 
agricultural 
working people, youth and students and men of culture in the 
Provinces and municipality spoke at the rallies. 
  The speakers said the Kwangju popular uprising in May 1980 
was a massive armed uprising in which the entire Kwangju 
citizens turned out and made a decisive resistance to the 
fascist violence in order to terminate the colonial domination 
of the U.S. imperialists and the military fascist rule and to 
achieve democratisation of the South Korean society and the 
reunification of the country, and a just anti-U.S., anti-fascist 
democratic resistance. 
  The desire of the valiant Kwangju resistance fighters for 
independence and democratisation of the South Korean society 
still has not been realized owing to the colonial enslavement 
policy of the U.S. imperialists, they noted. 
  They stressed that in order to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet regime and realize the desire of the martyrs of Kwangju, 
the South Korean students and people should wage vigorous mass 
struggles in all places to scrap such fascist laws as the 
"National Security Law", dissolve all the repressive machines 
and establish a true democratic government. 
  They stressed the need for the people of all segments of 
South Korea to turn out to check and frustrate the colonial 
domination and interference of the United States and get the 
U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A meeting of workers of 
the Nampo Smelting Complex was held on May 24 to support the 
struggle of the South Korean workers for a wage hike. 
  Yi Kwang-tu, chairman of the complex committee of the 
General 
Federation of Trade Unions, and other speakers said the South 
Korean workers eke out a scanty livelihood, not paid in time 
even insignificant wages and paying tax with it, while commodity 
prices soaring high. 
  It is only too natural that they have risen in struggle 
against the anti-popular predatory policy and wage-curbing move 
of the authorities, the speakers noted. 
  They charged that the South Korean ruling quarters, however, 
ruthlessly cracked down on the workers at the point of the 
bayonet by sending a large number of riot police to places of 
their protest rallies, demonstrations and sit-in strikes. 
  Saying the reality clearly shows that, while the Kim 
Yong-sam 
puppet clique is left intact at the helm of power, the South 
Korean workers cannot extricate themselves from the miserable 
lot, and independence, democracy and reunification cannot be 
expected, they expressed full support to the South Korean 
workers in their struggle for the right to existence, democracy 
and independent reunification. 
  They said the South Korean workers should not stop their 
struggle till their demand has been met but strengthen 
solidarity with the people of all other strata and take an 
organized joint action by pooling efforts with them.

<F P=106> ["Special Inspection of Japan's All Nuclear Facilities </F>
Urged"--KCNA headline"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Pak Yong-nam, director 
of the General Department of the Atomic Energy of the DPRK, in a 
letter to Hans Blix, general director of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, on May 23 said it is necessary for the 
IAEA Secretariat to raise Japan's plutonium concealment case for 
discussion at an extraordinary meeting of the board of governors 
of the agency without delay and probe the truth behind it and 
promptly take a measure for a more overall and thoroughgoing 
special inspection of all the nuclear facilities in Japan. 
  Recalling that as much as 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium 
had been concealed for five years at a factory of Japan where 
agency's groups of inspectors are said to have been stationed 
for inspection, the letter said: 
  "The international community expresses deep concern over the 
fact that the IAEA invented a 'nuclear suspicion' with regard to 
the DPRK's fledgling peaceful nuclear activities and thereby 
created complexity, while failing to call in question the 
concealment of plutonium in Japan and its dangerous nuclear 
activities, which is obviously a double-standard policy". 
  "This case cannot be overlooked today when Japan's nuclear 
armament which has reached the danger line in actuality poses a 
threat to peace and security in Asia, in the Korean peninsula in 
particular," the letter said, expressing the hope that the IAEA 
will discharge its original mission in compliance with its 
statute and with the requirements of the safeguards agreement it 
signed with the relevant country.

  [Text] Pak Yong-nam, director of the Atomic Energy General 
Department of the DPRK, has sent a letter to Hans Blix, general 
director of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], in 
connection with the fact that a case involving the concealment 
of plutonium had taken place in Japan. 
  The letter says: On 4 May, the director of the U.S. Nuclear 
Control Institute, in a letter to the U.S. Secretary of State, 
pointed out that 70 kg of plutonium, a massive amount, had been 
concealed in the Tokai Nuclear Fuel Plant, Ibaragi Prefecture, 
Japan. He also directed serious attention to this. 
  The letter points out as follows: 
  International opinion expresses the concern that, given the 
fact that numerous nuclear facilities have been operated in 
Japan for tens of years, a more massive amount of plutonium may 
have been concealed in Japan and used in producing nuclear 
weapons. Voices are growing every day that demand an urgent and 
clear explanation of the truth of this incident. 
  The agency invented a nuclear suspicion with regard to our 
fledgling [chongsohan] peaceful nuclear activities and thereby 
created complexity, while failing to call into question the fact 
that 70 kg of plutonium, a massive amount, had not been reported 
but concealed for five years at a plant in Japan, where it is 
said an IAEA inspection team stays permanently and conducts 
inspections, and Japan's dangerous nuclear activities. The 
international community expresses deep concern over the obvious 
double-standard policy. 
  The letter goes on to say that this case cannot be 
overlooked 
today when Japan's nuclear armament which has reached the danger 
line in actuality poses a threat to peace and security in Asia 
and, in particular, on the Korean peninsula. The letter also 
stressed that it is necessary for the secretariat of the agency 
to accept the voices of the international community as a matter 
of course; raise the case involving the concealment of plutonium 
in Japan for discussion at an extraordinary meeting of the 
agency's board of governors without delay; probe the truth 
behind it; take a measure for a more overall and thoroughgoing 
special inspection of all the nuclear facilities in Japan; and 
promptly take other practical measures to resolve the suspicion 
and worry of the international community.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Crime Must Be Counted"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- With no amount of 
attempt can the Japanese reactionaries veil their dark color as 
nuclear culprits and they must face a trial. Japan's crime in 
concealing a large quantity of plutonium must be counted. 
  NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today. 
  Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are resorting to 
despicable artifices to hush up the recently exposed concealment 
of 70 kilograms of plutonium at the Tokaimura nuclear 
fuel-making plant, the analyst says: 
  Japan is claiming that it was ignorant of a large quantity 
of 
plutonium sticking to the equipment of the fuel-making plant. 
But this far-fetched argument is unbecoming to Japan boasting 
itself of being advanced in nuclear technologies. No less 
ridiculous is the excuse of Japan that the case resulted from 
the negligence of cleaning of the equipment by the plant which 
was too much engrossed in the production of nuclear fuel through 
the operation of the fast breeder reactor. 
  Plutonium possessed by Japan now reportedly amounts to 26 
tons. It was several dozen years ago that Japan put its first 
nuclear facilities into operation. Now many reactors are 
operating in Japan. So, not much penetration is required to 
guess how much plutonium Japan is now concealing besides the 
exposed amount. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' concealment of plutonium is 
aimed 
at manufacturing nuclear weapons. If not, why has it kept 
dangeorus nuclear materials in secrecy? 
  The Japanese reactionaries, captive to the design of 
reinvasion, are making haste with the conversion of Japan into a 
nuclear power in a bid to realise their old dream of "the 
greater East Asia coprosperity sphere." 
  Japan's nuclear armament has reached a very dangerous stage. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' noisy row to do harm to the DPRK 
over its "nuclear development" is nothing but a petty trick to 
cover up their nuclear armament. 
  They are now openly claiming that if "sanctions" were taken 
against the DPRK by the United Nations, Japan would blockade the 
seas and send troops of "the self-defence forces" to the Korean 
War. 
  By going ahead with nuclear armament, the Japanese 
reactionaries are digging their own grave.

<F P=106> ["Chongnyon Covers Proud Road Full of Victory and Glory" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
dedicates an editorial to the 39th anniversary of the formation 
of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon), a DPRK's dignified and authoritative organization 
of Koreans overseas. 
  With the formation of Chongnyon on May 25, 1955, a proud new 
history of the movement of Koreans overseas based on the chuche 
idea was opened and, since then, the movement of Koreans 
overseas has developed as a genuine national patriotic movement, 
definitely getting on the track of chuche, the editorial notes, 
and continues: 
  By adopting the policy of modeling its ranks on the chuche 
idea as the main line, Chongnyon has thoroughly established the 
chuche- based ideological system and leadership system in the 
organization and fortified the singlehearted unity of the ranks 
and firmly built up its ranks into a patriotic organization of 
loyalty that would believe and follow always only the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. In recent years, it has made a new progress in 
preparing the younger generations as trustworthy successors to 
the patriotic cause, thereby creating a firm guarantee for 
stengthening and developing the Chongnyon organization into an 
eternal chuche-based organization of the citizens overseas of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a patriotic 
organisation. 
  Chongnyon has intensified the work of national unity among 
the Koreans overseas under the banner of great national unity, 
energetically waged the movement for national reunification as a 
mass movement embracing all the compatriots in Japan and 
strengthened friendship and unity with the world progressive 
people including the Japanese people, contributing to winning 
greater international support and solidarity for the socialist 
cause of chuche, the cause of national reunification and the 
patriotic cause of Chongnyon. 
  Although the situation has become complicated and the 
reactionaries' moves against the DPRK and Chongnyon have become 
more vicious, the Chongnyon officials and Koreans in Japan are 
giving spurs to the consolidation of the Chongnyon organization 
and fulfilment of patriotic tasks, deeply cherishing in their 
minds the faith that they will certainly emerge victorious since 
there is dear Comrade Kim Chong-il and the faith that the 
patriotic ranks of Chongnyon united in one mind around the dear 
leader are invincible. 
  The editorial notes that all achievements made by Chongnyon 
are a great victory of the chuche-based idea of the respected 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song on the movement of Koreans overseas 
and a brilliant fruition of the wise leadership and paternal 
loving care of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Foreign public denounced 
the suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan (Chongnyon) by the Japanese reactionaries. 
  Japanese Dietmen on May 19 investigated the suppression of 
Chongnyon by the Japanese police in Osaka. 
  They met with officials of Chongnyon and Japanese lawyers 
and 
acquainted themselves with the background and truth of the 
police crackdown. They concluded that the wholesale police 
search was motivated by a political intention to pry into the 
inside of the Chongnyon organisation and incite anti-Chongnyon 
sentiments. 
  They visited the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and 
called the police chief to account for the suppression of 
Chongnyon. 
  The Indian committee for supporting Korea's reunification, 
the all India Indo-Korean Friendship Association, the Indian 
Federation for World Cooperation and Cultural Relations, the 
Friendship Association of India and the Indian Diplomatic Club 
issued a joint statement May 14 denouncing the Japanese 
reactionaries' anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign. 
  The statement denounced the Japanese authorities' 
suppression 
of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as an intolerable challenge to 
the DPRK and the Korean people and urged them to immediately 
stop the unjustifiable and rude acts and apologize to the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Son Won-tae, a 
U.S.-resident Korean, and his companions on a visit to Pyongyang 
told KCNA on May 20 that they felt higher pride in being Korean 
nationals, seeing the daily developing motherland. 
  Son Won-tae said: "When I think about the great President 
Kim 
Il-song devoting his whole life to the country and the nation, I 
can hardly restrain thankful tears rolling down my cheeks. Our 
people are a happy and proud people because they have the great 
leader." 
  Yim Chun-su said: "The magnificent view of Pyongyang with 
the 
beautiful Taedong River flowing through it represents the 
ever-prospering looks of the motherland." 
  Pak Sang-chin said: "Those who are studying hard at the 
grand 
and richly decorated grand people's study house present quite a 
contrast to those at libraries in the United States who give 
themselves airs, seeking a gay life." 
  Kim Sun-cha said: "I was deeply impressed by the noble 
spiritual world of the people who are eager to exalt their 
country and nation. I keenly felt once more that when our nation 
unites and achieves national reunification, our motherland will 
prosper endlessly in the van of the world."

Jordan. 
  MINJU CHOSON says since the independence the Jordanian

the Korean people to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and achieve the reunification of the country. 
  Chairman of the for peace and socialism-the communist 
Workers' Party of Finland Timo Lahdenmaki in his speech at a 
rally celebrating May Day said the United States is the very one 
which has divided Korea. 
  The United States has been opposed to all the proposals of 
North Korea to settle the Korean question, seeking to perpetuate 
the division of Korea, he noted, adding: 
  "The United States expects the socialism of North Korea to 
collapse but the future of mankind lies in socialism. 
  "We should actively support the socialism of Korea with 
might 
and main. This is the only way of guaranteeing the victory of 
the international working class movement and a brighter future." 
  Addressing a mass rally celebrating May Day, Preben Moller 
Hansen, chairman of the Danish Workers' Party, Common Cause, 
said the United States is scheming to isolate and stifle 
socialist Korea under the pretext of the "nuclear issue". "We 
express full support to and solidarity with the Korean people in 
their struggle for just cause under the banner of socialism," he 
stressed. 
  He supported the proposal of the DPRK for negotiations with 
the United States to replace the armistice agreement with a 
peace agreement and establish a new peace arrangement on the 
Korean peninsula and demanded that the United States 
affirmatively accede to this proposal. 
  Delegates of the Communist Party of Denmark 
(Marxist-Leninist), the Danish Workers' Party, Common Cause, the 
Communist Party of Denmark, the Metal Workers Trade Union of 
Denmark, the Red Youth League of Denmark, the Denmark-the DPRK 
Friendship Association and other political parties and 
organisations expressed support to and solidarity with the 
Korean people in their struggle for the reunification of the 
country. 
  James Stewart, general secretary of the National Executive 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ireland, said that to defend 
the socialism of Korea and actively support and encourage the 
just struggle of the Korean people today is the internationalist 
duty of the communist and workers' parties of all countries.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Organisations and public 
figures of different countries in their statements urged the 
United States to respond to the DPRK-U.S. negotiations for the 
establishment of a new peace arrangement. 
  The Anti-imperialist Youth Union of Mali in a statement on 
May 6 fully supported the negotiations proposed by the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to replace the Armistice 
Agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new peace 
arrangement and demanded that the United States affirmatively 
accede to it. 
  The Congolese Association for Friendship Among Peoples in a 
statement May [date indistinct] said if the United States is 
interested even a little in the detente on the Korean peninsula 
and the guarantee of world peace, it must respond to the 
peaceloving negotiations proposal of the DPRK. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of 
the DPRK in a statement said the United States is trying to 
stifle socialism of Korea, but it is a big mistake. The Korean 
people have a weapon of singlehearted unity mightier than a 
nuclear bomb, it noted. 
  B. Sen Gupta, joint secretary of the All India Students 
Federation, in a statement on May 9 stressed that the United 
States must not resort to the anachronistic policy of military 
adventure against the DPRK but respond to negotiations with the 
DPRK to establish a new peace arrangement guaranteeing a durable 
peace in this region.

Popular Front of Workers, Peasants, and Students, met Kim 
Kyong-ho, our country's ambassador to Peru, on 13 May. 
  In the meeting, the ambassador conveyed greetings from the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il to Chairman Genaro Ledesma Izquieta. The chairman 
expressed deep gratitude for this and asked the ambassador to 
convey his heartfelt greetings to the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The chairman said as following: Recently, the Japanese 
reactionaries are clinging to anti-socialist, anti-Republic, and 
anti-Chongnyon [the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan] suppression in collusion with the South Korean puppets, 
instead of apologizing to the Korean people for its past 
criminal acts. The world should heighten its vigilance against 
the Japanese militarism. The Japanese reactionaries' any kind 
of maneuvers cannot frighten the Korean people who are following 
the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We will send invariable 
support and solidarity to the socialist cause of the Workers' 
Party of Korea and the Korean people's cause for reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Newspapers here today 
observe day of African liberation. 
  A summit of African independent states was held on May 25, 
1963, which declared the inauguration of the Organization of 
African Unity (OAU) and adopted its charter. 
  It was decided at the meeting to observe May 25 when the 
organization was founded as day of African liberation. 
  The founding of the OAU marked an important occasion in 
giving impetus to the struggle of the Africans for the 
liquidation of the colonial ruling system in the continent, 
promotion of cooperation and solidarity among nations and 
building of a new Africa, an article of NODONG SINMUN notes, and 
says: 
  On this occasion, the Korean people extend friendly 
congratulations and greetings to the African people. 
  Many changes have taken place in the African continent, 
renewing its appearance, thanks to the efforts of the Africans 
to achieve the prosperity of the continent by themselves. 
  The African people are working to expand the peace zone, the 
nuclear-free zone in the continent. 
  The OAU is playing an important role in the efforts of the 
African nations to build a new Africa. The organization 
discusses and decides on preferential problems in developing the 
continent and ensuring peace there at annual meetings of heads 
of state and government. 
  The Korean people sincerely rejoice over all the 
revolutionary changes taking place in Africa and will as ever 
extend active support to the just cause of the African people. 
  MINJU CHOSON carries an article entitled "African People Are 
Advancing" on this occasion.

  [Begin Kang speech] [passage omitted] Our party and the 
government of the Republic have made every effort to achieve the 
fatherland's reunification based on the principle of national 
independence in conformity with all the people's desire and the 
demand of the times. 
  However, our generous [aryang innun] proposals for the 
fatherland's reunification and all the people's aspiration for 
the reunification have not been realized because of the U.S. and 
South Korean authorities' splittist line and war maneuver. 
  The U.S. imperialists are adhering to the military adventure 
to crush [apsalhagi wihan kunsajok mohom] our socialist cause, 
stirring up the anti-Republic pressure commotion in the 
international arena over our nuclear problem. 
  Obsessed with war frenzy [chonjaeng kwangjunge hwanjangi 
toen], the Kim Yong-sam group is going to resume the Team Spirit 
nuclear war exercise by bringing U.S. nuclear war equipment such 
as Patriot missiles into South Korea, mentioning strong-arm 
countermeasure against us in collusion with outside forces. It 
is also openly promoting [kochwi] a war mood for northward 
invasion while talking about assuming a prompt dashing-in 
posture in the event of an emergency [yusasi chukkak torip 
taese]. 
  The U.S. imperialists and their followers are frantically 
running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and to crush 
[apsal] our socialism over the nuclear issue. Any pressure or 
threat, however, cannot work with us. They cannot resolve the 
issue by adhering to such a method, and this only drives the 
situation towards catastrophe [sataerul pagugero molgogalsu 
issumnida]. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities should 
behave discreetly, facing all facts squarely. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["55th Anniversary of Victory in Musan Area Battle Marked" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was 
held at the People's Palace of Culture today on the occasion of 
the 55th anniversary of the victory in the Musan area battle 
organized and commanded by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song. 
  Present at the meeting were Pak Song-chol, member of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers' 
Party of Korea [WPK] and vice-president; Choe Kwang, member of 
the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and chief of the 
general staff of the Korean People's Army; and other party and 
government officials. 
  Kang Sok-sung, member of the C.C., the WPK and director of 
the Party History Institute of the Party Central Committee, 
delivered a report. 
  He said the battle, which recorded a shining page in the 
Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle, was 
a historic operation of advance into the homeland which was 
organized under an outstanding plan of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song to lead to a constant upsurge the Korean revolution 
as a whole with the anti- Japanese armed struggle in its centre, 
thus promoting the cause of national liberation, and which was 
waged under his wise guidance. 
  He quoted President Kim Il-song as saying: 
  "...The Musan area battle was, indeed, a significant one 
which greatly helped further inspire the people in the homeland 
with the spirit of the anti-Japanese struggle and lead the 
revolutionary movement to a higher tide." 
  The reporter said: 
  Grave difficulties were created before the Korean revolution 
in the period around the Musan area battle, with the Japanese 
imperialists intensifying the reactionary offensive as never 
before. 
  In those days President Kim Il-song called a meeting at 
Beidadingzi in April 1939 and indicated the policy of dealing 
one strike after another at the Japanese imperialist aggressors 
through a vigorous counter-offensive and advancing into the 
homeland again. 
  Under this policy, the great leader advanced into the 
homeland across the Amnok River, leading the main unit of the 
Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on May 18, 1939. 
  The members of the KPRA including Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an 
indomitable communist revolutionary fighter, conducted political 
propaganda in various forms, renewing their firm determination 
to bring earlier the day of national liberation. 
  President Kim Il-song made a historic speech "Let Us Rise Up 
Vigorously in the Anti-Japanese Struggle To Hasten the 
Liberation of the Homeland" before Sinsadong people. 
  In his speech, he clarified the character and mission of the 
KPRA and said that the entire nation must unite closely as one 
on the anti-Japanese front, turn out courageously in the sacred 
war against Japanese imperialism and actively support the KPRA. 
  Upset by the advance of the KPRA into the Musan area, the 
Japanese imperialists mobilized a large force and desperately 
chased the unit. 
  Seeing through the enemy's intention, the great leader, with 
a superb operation of allurement and ambush, wiped out at one 
stroke the enemy attempting to "encircle and annihilate" the 
KPRA on the Taehongdan plain on May 23, thus concluding the 
historic operation of advance into the Musan area with a 
brilliant victory. 
  In his report, Kang Sok-sung said "the advance of the KPRA 
into the homeland and the historic victory in the Musan area 
battle were a brilliant fruition of the chuche-based military 
idea and commanding art of the respected leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, an ever- victorious iron-willed brilliant commander and 
great military strategist, and a historic event which led the 
Korean revolution as a whole centering on the anti-Japanese 
armed struggle to a constant upswing under the banner of chuche."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- An increasing number of 
railway sections are switched over to electric traction in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The project for the electrification of the Hoeryong-Haksong 
section in the northern tip of the country has begun recently. 
  In the project they have to erect thousands of electric 
poles, extend electric wires and communications line, lower the 
tunnel ground and build transformer substations and other 
structures in the 168 km section. 
  The nation's railway electrification started in 1948. More 
than 850 kilometres of sections were switched over to electric 
traction in 1960s, more than 3,000 kilometres in 1970s and the 
middle of 1980s and 800 kilometres in the period of the third 
seven-year plan (1987-1993). Thus, the main trunk-line 
electrification has been completed in the main. 
  The rate of haulage by electric locomotive has reached over 
90 percent in freight transport, with the result that the 
transit capacity and transport capacity of railways have further 
increased and the demand of the national economy for transport 
is met fully. This year, the DPRK Government envisages 
increasing investment in the railway transport domain in the 
state budget 3 percent compared with last year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, reiterating 
that diplomacy is the only way to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear row, has urged the United States to offer detailed plans 
on normalization of relations with Pyongyang. 
  In an interview with the ASAHI SHIMBUN in the United States, 
the chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the 
Asia-Pacific Region said Washington will never allow North Korea 
to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  Kim voiced optimism on resolution of the nuclear dispute 
because Pyongyang's overriding goal is not to possess nuclear 
weapons but to establish diplomatic relations with Washington. 
  Therefore, the United States should tell China that it 
intends to normalize relations with North Korea in order to 
secure Chinese cooperation, Kim said. The former South Korean 
opposition leader has been visiting the United States. 
  Since China does not want to see a Japan armed with nuclear 
weapons, the United States would be able to obtain Chinese 
cooperation, Kim added. 
  As long as Washington does not provide clear assurances to 
North Korea through diplomatic channels, it will be difficult to 
resolve the nuclear row, he said. 
  North Korea is suspicious about U.S. intentions because 
Washington has failed to offer any detailed plans, Kim said, 
adding that Pyongyang is worried that when the nuclear row is 
cleared up, the United States will take issue with North Korean 
human rights absues, chemical weapons, terrorism and arms 
exports to the Middle East. 
  North Korea refuses to accept complete inspections of its 
nuclear facilities because if it did, it would lose "the card" 
for a third round of high-level negotiations with the United 
States, Kim said. 
  Once Pyongyang's nuclear card is used, the attention of the 
United States and the international community will shift to 
human rights and other issues, he said.

  [Text] Los Angeles, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Chairman Kim 
Tae-chung of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation has called for a 
national referendum on the government's commonwealth plan as the 
first step toward national reunification. 
  Speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the University of 
Southern California in a hotel here Monday, the former South 
Korean opposition leader said the North Korean nuclear problem 
should be solved while Kim Il-song is alive because he alone can 
offer a real concession in foreign policy. 
  North Korea has made a number of diplomatic concessions, 
such 
as simultaneous admission of North and South Korea to the United 
Nations, cross-recognition of Seoul and Pyongyang by the four 
powers (the United States, Japan, China and Russia) and mutual 
recognition by Seoul and Pyongyang of the legitimacy of their 
respective governments, for its survival since 1991. Since Kim 
Il-song alone could concede such issues, he said, solution of 
the nuclear dispute and other matters is necessary before the 
death of the 82-year-old strongman. 
  The commonwealth plan will likely be realized during 
President Kim Yong-sam's term in office, he observed, adding 
that he believes the plan, if referred to a national vote, will 
be approved by the people. "In that case, the government can 
launch inter-Korean negotiations with confidence and authority," 
he remarked. 
  Because Kim Il-song is using the nuclear issue as a 
bargaining card to normalize relations with the United States 
and secure American economic cooperation, the only way to break 
the nuclear standoff is for Washington to guarantee Pyongyang's 
security by establishing diplomatic relations and suspending the 
"Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea, he said, 
reiterating that the nuclear issue should be solved in a package 
deal. 
  North Korea must expose its nuclear development program to 
the world and promise to maintain peace and security on the 
Korean peninsula, he stressed. China should then cooperate in 
ensuring North Korea's commitment to security on the peninsula, 
he added. 
  As Kim Il-song recently showed an interest in visiting the 
United States, "We should not sneer at this olive branch he 
offered," Kim Tae-chung said. If "the great leader" ever visited 
the United States, North Korea might adopt a milder and more 
flexible foreign policy. Asked whether he would run for 
president again at a critical stage leading to reunification, he 
replied, "I'll not run even if the people want me to run."

  [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has notified 
the United Nations Command (UNC) that it has established "the 
Korean People's Army representative mission at Panmunjom" to 
replace its component of the Military Armistice Committee, the 
UNC announced Wednesday. 
  A command spokesman said the UN Command plans to ask North 
Korea, which unilaterally withdrew from the Armistice Committee 
recently, to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the committee 
soon to discuss the issue. 
  North Korean Army Lt. Colonel Yu Yong-chol made the 
notification on Tuesday morning at Panmunjom, in his capacity as 
chief liaison officer for the newly organized mission, when he 
contacted UNC Lt. Colonel R. Flury, the command reported. 
  North Korea, however, told the command that it would 
maintain 
its telephone lines at the joint duty officers' room at 
Panmunjom. 
  North Korea unilaterally withdrew its representatives from 
the Military Armistice Committee on April 27, demanding the 
Korean armistice agreement signed in 1953 be replaced by a peace 
accord. Pyongyang also sought the withdrawal of the Polish 
representative from the communist side of the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission.

    [Editorial Report] With the exception of TONG-A ILBO, all 
Seoul vernacular morning papers on 25 May merely provide 
straight reports of North Korea's recent notification to the UN 
Forces side that it was replacing its negotiating body to the 
Military Armistice Commission [MAC] with a Panmunjom mission of 
the Korean People's Army [KPA]. The moderate TONG-A ILBO 
carries, on page 2, a 600-word article by reporter Pak Che-kyun 
entitled "The Significance of North Korea's `establishment of a 
Panmunjom Mission'." 
  Reporting on North Korea's notification, the article 
comments 
that "this attempt of North Korea aimed at incapacitating the 
MAC, stems from its intent to topple the present Armistice 
Agreement system. What is more, it is a product of its 
hitherto-employed tactics to replace the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace agreement." 
  Holding that the conclusion of a peace agreement with the 
United States is an overriding goal of North Korea designed to 
promote the relations with the United States while excluding 
South Korea, the paper says "Regardless of the North's stance, 
the ROK and U.S. Governments are assuming a stance that the 
present Armistice Agreement should be adhered to. Hence, 
chances are high that the two governments will again call on the 
North to abide by the Armistice Agreement through a 
government-level statement or a Panmunjom channel." 
  The article then predicts that "despite North Korea's 
stubborn persistence on instituting the Panmunjom Mission," the 
issue would not be a big problem for the MAC system because "the 
function of the MAC itself was already paralyzed" ever since an 
ROK general was appointed as a senior member of the UN Forces' 
side to the MAC. 
  The article then concludes: "Accordingly, the ROK Government 
is expected to cope with the issue by proclaiming its basic 
stance to `convert from the present armistice state to a peace 
state between the North and South' as stipulated in the 
North-South Agreement."

  [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is beckoning 
South Koreans to invest and visit China via its ports, officials 
of the Korea Maritime and Port Administration, a trade 
association and industry sources said Wednesday. 
  North Korea's External Economic Cooperation Promotion 
Committee Director, Hyon Sok-hui, met with South Korean shipping 
officials on May 15 in Yanji, China, promising free entry to 
Najin port for South Korean citizens as well as ships and 
guaranteeing their safety, the sources said. 
  Pyongyang has sought Beijing's cooperation in letting South 
Korean tourists to China use direct sea routes to the North 
Korean cities of Chongjin and Najin from South Korea's 
southeastern port of Pusan, Korea Foreign Trade Association 
(KFTA) officials said. 
  In addition, the communist North has asked South Korean 
companies to invest in the Najin and Sonbong free economic and 
trade zones as well as infrastructure projects. 
  North Korea's decision to allow port entry by South Koreans 
has often been conveyed indirectly via ethinc Korean businessmen 
in China, but never directly to South Korea by a senior Northern 
official. 
  South Korean shipping officials will meet with the external 
economic cooperation promotion committee vice chairman in 
Beijing on Saturday to specifically discuss regular direct 
service between Pusan and Najin as well as investment in the 
communist country. 
  KFTA officials confirmed that Pyongyang had proposed to the 
city governments of Hunchun, Tumen and Yanji that South Korean 
tourists bound for China be allowed to enter via its ports. 
  In return for allowing direct sea routes, the North has 
asked 
China to construct railways and roads connecting to the mainland 
and for support in road and railway construction. 
  By offering direct sea routes, Pyongyang wants to draw South 
Korean and Japanese investment into the railway and road network 
between North Korea and China, KFTA officials said. 
  If the idea is realized, South Koreans will be able to 
travel 
to Mt. Paektu and other places of interest adjacent to North 
Korea's border with China through North Korean soil starting 
from as early as next year. 
  But KMTA authorities point out that North Korea has not made 
formal notification of the decision through official channels 
like inter-Korean dialogue but via businessmen and Chinese 
provincial city governments, meaning the plan cannot be blindly 
accepted. 
  They say Seoul cannot allow free travel to the North unless 
Pyongyang promises to ensure the safety of its people through 
negotiations. 
  The industry, eager to take the North up on its offer, says 
Seoul should set aside politics to seek clarification from 
Pyongyang on exactly what its intentions are.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Development of the Tumen River Must Be </F>
Reconsidered"] 
  [Text] According to a recent foreign report, the North 
Korean authorities have formulated specific plans to establish a 
free trade zone in the northeastern area of their territory by 
inviting the Chinese enterprises, and ROK enterprises in China, 
to participate in the Tumen River development project, around 
the areas of Chongjin and Najin. 
  North Korea has reportedly planned to invite a Chinese 
delegation from Jilin Province, and businessmen of the ROK 
enterprises in China, to Pyongyang to discuss the Tumen River 
development project under the auspices of the Chongjin city 
development committee. It will hold another meeting with them in 
Beijing around the end of this month to discuss specific plans 
for joint cooperation regarding the project. 
  It has not been learned if participants in the meeting would 
form an international cooperative system to promote their joint 
cooperation. According to some reports, however, North Korea 
and China have already exchanged a protocol regarding the Tumen 
River project. 
  This project will likely be carried out in the following 
way: 
North Korea and China will be a key factor in carrying out the 
project, while welcoming ROK capital to it. This is the way 
North Korea has so far planned to implement the project. 
  As we have mentioned over and over again, ROK enterprises 
should consult with the government about economic cooperation 
with North Korea, whether it is carried out in the form of the 
Tumen development project or the construction of a plant in the 
Nampo area. We stress once again that no civilian-level economic 
cooperation without the government's participation should be 
conducted. 
  Also, our government and enterprises should not forget, even 
for a moment, that the North Korean system is an unreasonable 
and extreme communist regime, not found anywhere else in modern 
history. For over half a century, there have been no changes in 
the Kim Il- song dictatorial system. At the same time, the 
so-called chuche idea--which indicates that "Korea is one," and 
that "Korea is under the bosom and grace of Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il"--is an absolute idea presently worshiped by all North 
Korea people throughout the country. In other words, if a South 
Korean businessman builds a plant in North Korea, this can be 
theoretically done under the guidance and grace of Kim Il-song 
and Kim Chong-il. 
  There are, however, some important points in carrying out 
the 
Tumen River development project. That is, by participating in 
it, we can lead North Korea to go from a closed society to an 
open one; we can form our business connections [yongogwon] on 
the area of the Tumen River in the initial stage of its 
development; and seek the balanced development of our land by 
promoting development in the most backward area of the country 
in preparation for the days after national reunification. Also, 
it is internationally very significant to build the free trade 
zone in the northeastern area because there is no multilateral 
cooperative system there. 
  This project must not be, however, carried out as intended 
by 
North Korea. North Korea's hidden intention is to make foreign 
currency quickly, while trying to become the master of the 
northeast by inviting a considerable amount of the foreign 
capital, including from ROK enterprises, to the project. This 
is why the North Korean authorities are so interested. By 
properly meeting China's persistent desire to advance into Korea 
through the East Sea [Sea of Japan], North Korea has 
appropriately formulated plans to lead the ROK enterprises to 
participate in the Tumen project. 
  When the Tumen River development project was first 
discussed, 
the six countries surrounding the area showed interest and tried 
to participate in it. They are South Korea, North Korea, China, 
Russia, Mongolia, and Japan. However, only North Korea and 
China are now interested in the project because North Korea 
refuses to open its doors. 
  We hope that the government and our enterprises should not 
be 
entangled in North Korea's plot. They must not invest even a 
penny unless North Korea earnestly asks for it and make efforts 
for negotiations with South Korea. In particular, I would like 
to call on our businessmen to keep this in mind and be prudent 
in dealing with North Korea.

  [Text] Moscow, May 25 (YONHAP) -- Russia and North Korea 
have initialed a new logging agreement featuring the stepped-up 
protection of human rights of North Korean loggers in Siberia, 
Russia's ITAR-TASS reported in a dispatch from Pyongyang on 
Wednesday. 
  The report said the agreement was inked after ten days' 
negotiations in Pyongyang. 
  The two countries had negotiations several times in the past 
to work out a new agreement but in vain due to differences over 
loggers' human rights issues. 
  The new agreement will be formally signed very shortly, 
enabling more than 10,000 North Korean loggers to continue to 
work at Siberian logging yards at least in the next five years, 
it said. 
  The new agreement provides that North Korea should abide by 
Russian laws with respect to the operation of logging yards in 
Siberia and should recognize loggers' right to strike as a means 
of resolving labor disputes. The existing agreement bans any 
strike by North Korean loggers. 
  This is the first time North Korea has ever given their 
workers the right to strike either at home or abroad. 
  The agreement also calls for improved treatment of loggers 
as 
it stipulates that loggers' working conditions like wages and 
working hours are to be set by North Korea as in the past, but 
they should not be unfavorably compared with those provided 
under Russia's labor standard regulations. 
  During negotiations for the new agreement, the two sides did 
not touch on the activities of secret North Korean security 
agents against their loggers in the Russian territory, the 
report said.

CSO 

  [Text] Recently, North Korea has been stepping up 
broadcasts focused on the negative side of Western countries 
and Russia and other former Eastern bloc countries where the 
socialist system has collapsed. 
  A tally shows that for 4 months from last November through 
the end of this February, North Korea broadcast such reports 
through the Central Broadcasting Station and Radio Pyongyang on 
19 occasions. 
  By month, the number of such broadcasts was: two in 
November, 
five in December, nine in January, and three in February. The 
main theme of such broadcasts is: "Former socialist countries, 
now converted to capitalism, are falling into moribund and 
morbid societies with cases of crime and social vice increasing 
with each passing day; and the workers in East Europe and 
Russia are yearning to return to socialism." 
  In this connection, in an (8 February) program introducing 
the economic condition in Russia, the Central Broadcasting 
Station said that Russia is in such an economic mess that "it 
is on its knees holding out its hands." Earlier, in a (31 
January) interview program Radio Pyongyang played up phenomena 
showing the seamy side of the former Eastern bloc countries 
that have appeared since the fall of the socialist saying, 
"Numerous young women in former socialist countries which are 
now converted to capitalism are falling into prostitution and 
some of them are even being sold to foreign countries." 
  In particular, in a 25 Jan broadcast the Central 
Broadcasting 
Station said, "Each year in Russia 10,000 people contract 
syphilis, 200,000 get gonorrhea, and over 5 million become 
afflicted with various virus diseases." Earlier, a 3 Jan 
broadcast the same station said: "Cases of crime committed by 
Russian minors have sharply increased these several years, 15 
times faster than the increase in the number of adult crimes." 
A 19 January Radio Pyongyang broadcast said: "As of 1993, the 
total number of AIDS cases throughout the world was 851,620. By 
country, the United States led with more than 339,000 cases, 
followed by France with 26,000, Spain with 21,000, and Italy 
with 18,000 in that order. AIDS is rapidly spreading in 
capitalist society." 
  Reportedly, it is in accordance with the "measures to 
improve 
the editing of news broadcasts" adopted by the Party Central 
Committee that North Korea is playing up the negative side of 
former socialist countries in Eastern Europe and Western 
capitalist countries. In the wake of the collapse of the 
socialist system in East Europe and the disintegration of the 
CPSU, North Korea issued a new news broadcasting guideline to 
the Central Broadcasting Committee in order to prevent an 
ideological unrest of its people and tighten up controls by the 
regime. The main purport of the guideline is "to make the 
substance of news broadcasts consistent with the intentions of 
the Party and make them oriented toward mass agitation." 
  The following is the gist of the guideline: 
  --The Central Broadcasting Committee shall closely oversee 
the operations of the broadcasting committees of provinces and 
special municipalities under its jurisdiction. 
  --Successes of the chuche-based economy shall be reported as 
they occur, and the corrupt social and cultural aspects of 
capitalism shall be reported one instance each day as a daily 
responsibility. 
  --Broadcasting stations concerned shall primarily broadcast 
recorded materials, and when choosing a factory or enterprise 
and persons to appear on a particular program, the selection 
shall be made in an organized manner under a plan drawn up in 
advance. 
  --In an interview with local inhabitants, broad dialects and 
extraneous remarks shall be avoided. 
  Under these new guidelines on news broadcasting, North Korea 
is having its overseas missions collect and transmit to the 
home government materials on these subjects: economic poverty 
in Western countries and East European countries formerly under 
socialism; social crimes such as alcoholism and gang violence; 
and natural calamities and the corrupt aspects of capitalism. 
  These materials are delivered to the Central Broadcasting 
Committee through the Foreign Ministry for use in presenting 
"the true picture of capitalism" to the North Korean people.

    [Editorial Report] On 23 May, ROK vernacular newspapers 
carry articles on the current situation of the money flow to 
North Korea by the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and its power struggle. 
  On page 23, the moderate HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word 
article by reporter Hong Yun-o on the 39th anniversary of the 
founding of Chongnyon which is 25 May. The article starts off 
by noting that there are moves in Chongnyon's organization 
because of the fact that the work to repatriate Korean residents 
in Japan to North Korea has failed, that North Korea is falling 
into isolation, and that moves are being made for sanctions 
against North Korea by the international community. Citing 
NAEWOE News Agency, the article notes that celebrations of the 
39th anniversary of Chongnyon's founding will be held without 
its chairman, Han Tok-su, who is currently in Pyongyang amid 
various rumors. It notes that currently the responsible Vice 
Chairman Ho Chong-man is actually leading the group since it 
changed its organization in 1992 to a one-man chairman and a 
nine-men vice chairmen system. The article concludes by saying 
that a stumbling block in normalizing Japan-North Korean 
relations stems from the fact that North Korea has even 
prohibited Japanese women married to Chongnyon members from 
visiting Japan freely. 
  On page 8, the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries a 
900-word 
article by reporter Ku Pon-yong from the "North Korea Today" 
column on the intense power struggle within Chongnyon. The 
article begins by noting that since Chongnyon Chairman Han 
Tok-su returned to Pyongyang, internal discord has intensified. 
The article continues to speculate why Han Tok-su, who has 
diverted Chongnyon's assets to his aides and under his name, 
returned to Pyongyang, noting that since he has a hold of 
Chongnyon's assets, he must not be irritated. It notes that 
there are signs that Ho Chong-man, who emerged as Chongnyon's 
responsible vice chairman, is being supported by Kim Chong-il, 
and his opposing forces will be at odds with each other for 
power within Chongnyon. It notes that originally First Vice 
Chairman Yi Chin-kyu was to take Han Tok-su's place, but rather 
Ho Chong-man, who is well versed in Chongnyon's money flow, was 
appointed. The article says Chongnyon's businessmen speculate 
that the appointment of Ho Chong-man is an advance measure to 
shelter Chongnyon's assets for North Korea, thus some Chongnyon 
businessmen are filing lawsuits to recover real estate which 
they donated to Chongnyon. The article concludes by saying that 
movements to urge to guarantee human rights within North Korea 
and others which are being promoted centering on human rights 
organizations in Japan are other elements that are accelerating 
unrest within Chongnyon. 
  On page 4, the moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a 
1,200-word article by reporter No Ung-kun on the scale of 
Japan's remittance of money to North Korea. The article 
introduces an article carried by Japan's contemporary economic 
journal, NIKKEI BUSINESS, on how much money is actually being 
sent to North Korea by Japan. It notes that no one knows the 
exact amount of money being remitted, but experts predict it to 
be around $1.8 billion annually. The article continues to cite 
NIKKEI BUSINESS saying that the money sent to North Korea by 
Chongnyon is about $600-700 million, and that a larger amount of 
money is remitted to North Korea through a third country. 
  On page 20, KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries a 1,400-word article 
by 
reporter Kim Pung-son from the "North Korean News" column on why 
Han Tok-su, Chongnyon's number one man, was returned to North 
Korea. The article starts off by saying that the reason for his 
return may be to bring in Chongnyon's assets to North Korea. 
The article carries an analysis made by NAEWOE News Agency on 
why Han Tok-su returned to North Korea. The first analysis is 
that if Han Tok-su remains in Japan, it may have a bad influence 
in consolidating the Kim Chong-il succession system. The second 
analysis is that it is to restructure Chongnyon's organization 
and return Han Tok-su's enormous assets to North Korea. The 
analysis then writes about Han Tok-su's influence and about 
appointing Ho Chong-man as Chongnyon's responsible vice 
chairman. It continues to write about Ho Chong-man's ambition, 
his position at Chongnyon, and his faithfulness to Chongnyon.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Mun Chong-su, 
secretary-general of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party (DLP), held working-level talks with Li Shuzheng, head of 
the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist 
Party, to discuss promoting exchanges betweem the DLP and the 
Communist Party. 
  The two parties, which began their exchanges when South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, agreed 
to expand the exchanges to low-level party structures and grass 
roots, including district chapters and young party members. 
  Mun, saying party chairman Kim Chong-pil hoped to visit 
China 
in November, discussed a detailed schedule with Li. He also 
invited a senior Communist Party official to visit Seoul, DLP 
officials said. 
  Mun and Li traded views on boosting cooperation to help 
peace 
take root in Northeast Asia and supported a further 
strengthening of economic and overall relations between the two 
governments. 
  After the meeting, Mun met with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at 
Diaoyutai, the official guest house, and visited the Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday afternoon. 
  At the ministry, Mun is scheduled to be briefed by Tang 
Jiaxuan, vice foreign minister for Asia, on the situation in 
Northeast Asia and they will exchange views on pending major 
issues between South Korea and China, including the North Korean 
nuclear problem.

  [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Electric Power 
Corp. (KEPCO) concluded a technology cooperation agreement with 
its Chinese counterpart in Beijing Wednesday covering the areas 
of construction, management and technology of nuclear power 
plants, KEPCO officials said. 
  KEPCO President Rieh Chong-hun signed the agreement with 
Jiang Xinxiong, president of the China National Nuclear Corp. 
(CNNC). 
  In addition, KEPCO will sign technology cooperation 
agreements with North China Electric Power Group (NCPG) and 
Northeast China Electric Power Group Corp. (NEPG) on Thursday in 
the fields of construction and management of hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric power plants and electric supply. 
  As Chinese demand for electric power soars, the country 
hopes 
to expand its electric power facilities with South Korean 
technological and financial support. 
  KEPCO officials expect that conclusion of the agreements 
will 
accelerate bilateral cooperation in the electric power sector. 
  Meanwhile, Rieh will visit Yanji city in the Korean 
autonomous prefecture on Saturday to sign a letter of intent 
with mayor Piao Dongkui on a joint venture for the Yanji 
combined heat and power plant.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta, May 24 (YONHAP)--South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu blazed a visible trail as he traveled 
Southeast Asia over the past 10 days that will enliven bilateral 
and regional relations for some time to come. 
  Not many other trips will ever be so multi-faceted and 
multi-purpose as this one, which took Han to the Philippines, 
Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, although overall themes were 
evident--mustering support for Seoul's bid to grab a 
non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and explaining 
the South's position on the North Korean nuclear situation, for 
instance. 
  Another Asian country, Sri Lanka, is a competitor for the 
UNSC seat for 1996-97. Bearing that in mind, Han tried to build 
a consensus during his visit to put up a single candidate from 
the region for the seat. 
  On the North Korean nuclear issue, Han tried to create a 
balanced view by emphasizing that the matter concerns the 
international community and thus should be dealt with from a 
global perspective. 
  Indonesia is the land where these objectives were most 
highlighted. Jakarta, current chairman of the Non-aligned 
Movement (NAM), serves as North Korea's diplomatic base for 
Southeast Asia. Han's talks with President Suharto and Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas were crucial not only in forging close ties 
with NAM but in getting the movement to note the global impact 
of the North Korean nuclear row. 
  On Seoul's bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security 
Council, Alatas said his country "had sympathy" for South Korean 
efforts. Jakarta, most likely to assume the non-permanent seat 
for 1995-96, could assist Seoul's bid the following year by 
building an Asian consensus on competition between South Korea 
and Sri Lanka. 
  During other parts of his visit, Han mostly filled in the 
blanks of bilateral relations while noting the roles each 
country would play in furthering South Korea's relations with 
the region. 
  On a bilateral level, Han proposed to the Philippines that 
they establish a "special partnership" covering economic, 
cultural and social sectors and received a favorable response. 
  At the regional level, Manila will be the coordinator for 
the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from July 1994 
for two years, acting as a go-between in Korea-ASEAN relations 
during the period. South Korean officials say Han's visit will 
work positively in enhancing such coordination. 
  In Bangkok, the bilateral focus was on rectifying the trade 
imbalance in Seoul's favor and activating South Korean 
investment in Thailand. The two countries are expected to open 
trade ministers' talks later this year. 
  Ties with Bangkok are already secured at the regional level, 
with Thailand hosting an ASEAN meeting July 25. The regional 
importance of South Korea-Thailand relations will grow as 
Bangkok attempts to expand ASEAN by including the three 
Indochinese countries and Myanmar. 
  In Vietnam, South Korea sought to establish a foothold in 
the 
last remaining Asian economic frontier. Han confirmed Seoul's 
pledge of 50 million dollars from its Economic Development and 
Cooperation fund (EDCF) and 10 million dollars more in aid. He 
took it into his own hands to resolve the bitter past with 
Vietnam, recalling how more than 320,000 Korean soldiers fought 
on Saigon's side during the Vietnam war. "There was damage in 
our past relations," he told Vietnamese President Le Duc An in 
what were the most conciliatory words yet uttered by a South 
Korean foreign minister. "We must overcome it by establishing 
forward-looking ties." 
  Han called his Asian trip an example of "quiet diplomacy" -- 
the kind that doesn't require immediate results but long-term 
efforts to look anew at Asia. 
  His aides intentionally avoided setting a prior agenda and 
format for Han's talks with the leaders of the Philippines, 
Thailand and Indonesia to allow for free discussion on whatever 
they saw fit. 
  Han's 10-day journey to Asia is expected to paint a new 
image 
of South Korea as it searches for a more visible role in the 
international community.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Canada 
have agreed to work out concrete action programs to further 
strengthen bilateral cooperative relations in the area of 
economy, the Foreign Ministry reported Tuesday. A ministry 
official said the agreement was reached at the first joint task 
team meeting of the "Korea- Canada special partnership 
relations" held on Monday. 
  At the meeting, delegates decided to map out concrete and 
tangible programs to better facilitate improved market approach, 
industrial cooperation and joint advancement to third countries 
with a view to helping form special partnership relations 
between the two countries. 
  They also agreed to explore multi-pronged ways to ensure 
closer mutual cooperation at such multilateral organizations as 
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC). 
  During the meeting, Canada suggested Korea's tie-up with the 
North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA) or the conclusion of a 
Korea-Canada free trade agreement. But, Korean delegates 
expressed the view that this is no stage to review such matters 
under the present circumstance. 
  Creation of the "Korea-Canada special partnership relations" 
was agreed on during the Korea-Canada summit held in Seattle 
last November during the APEC summit meeting. 
  After another round of talks in Canada next month, the task 
team will prepare a joint report by the end of next month for 
final adoption before the next APEC ministerial conference in 
November. 
  At the meeting, Korea was represented by Second Assistant 
Foreign Minister Sun Chon-yong and Canada by Barry Carim, 
assistnat minister of foreign affairs and trade.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Tong-song, Professor of Economics at the </F>
School of Political Economics, Chungang University: "New 
Horizon for ROK Diplomacy--ROK-China-Japan Three-Way 
Diplomacy"] 
  [Excerpts] Currently a strong whirlwind of "challenge and 
opportunity" is rising over Northeast Asia. This whirlwind, 
coinciding with the process of building new post-cold war world 
order, is being generated by the discord and friction between 
opposing cultures as China, Japan, and the ROK try to weld 
themselves into a Northeast Asian sphere of influence so that 
it may become the center of international order in the 21st 
century, replacing the United States and Europe. 
  On the other hand, the ROK, China, and Japan are each 
looking 
to secure a position of regional hegemony by taking advantage 
of the changes in the outside world, and trying to find ways to 
adapt themselves to these changes. Their ambitions are giving 
rise to recurring whirlwinds in this region. At the moment, 
their ambitions are hidden behind these whirlwinds. There is 
no telling how soon, or in what form the effects will be felt. 
  It is precisely because of these changes that the civilian 
government in South Korea has begun to talk about improving the 
nation's competitive strength, begun to attach more weight to 
internationalization, and started to advocate a "new 
diplomacy." In the short term we need to continue to further 
our pragmatic national security and economic interests as much 
as possible in the interest of existing cooperative relations 
with the United States, China, and Japan. In the mid to long 
term, we need to lay, by our own effort, the national foundation 
that will enable us to increase our influence in the new 
international order and seek future prosperity. This makes it 
all the more imperative for us to clearly perceive the given 
"opportunity and challenge" and work out an independent 
strategy for the future. 
  President Kim Yong-sam's scheduled visit to Japan and China 
for summit meetings with their leaders is coming at a 
historical moment when the prevailing international political 
situation gives hope and opportunity despite its uncertainties 
and uneasiness. The coming trip could stop at making us feel 
keenly about the difficult "challenge" posed by the outside 
environment, or serve as an "opportunity" to take advantage of 
the uncertain international environment. Needless to say, what 
all of us want is successful fulfillment of this opportunity. 
This fulfillment requires an overall change in thinking on the 
perceptual as well strategic planes with regard to the idea of 
"the ROK-China-Japan triangular alignment." 
  From the ROK point of view, the triangular relationship of 
the ROK, China, and Japan has roughly two aspects. One aspect 
is the existing status quo-oriented pattern of cooperating with 
China and Japan to promote ROK-Japan economic cooperation and 
ROK-China exchanges from the standpoint of seeking our national 
interests while maintaining the ROK- U.S. alliance and 
friendship as the immutable axle. Under this pattern, our goal 
in the ROK-Japan relationship will be the correction of the 
trade imbalance, the acceleration of technology transfers, the 
promotion of friendship on the government and private levels, 
and the respect of Japan for the status of the ROK and its 
people. 
  In ROK-China relations, our main goal will be the expansion 
of trade, the strengthening of government-level cooperation for 
the expansion of industrial cooperation, the promotion of 
private-level investments, and the acceleration of cooperation 
in the diverse areas of technology and management. Short-term 
reality makes the promotion of such cooperation essential, and 
this cooperation is realizable. However, this course separates 
the economy from security, and it does not mean that we 
ourselves will engineer the structural change in the future 
international order. 
  Another aspect of the triple relationship is that this 
relationship means a new forward-looking alignment with an eye 
into the 21st century. It relates to the questions of what 
independent method the ROK would use to bring China and Japan 
together and what strategic position the ROK would take in the 
event, for instance; the security environment on the Korean 
Peninsula should change, accompanied by the revamping of the 
international order in Northeast Asia. The international order 
is a result of the rivalry and discord between the United 
Stats, China, and Japan. 
  To be more specific, let us assume that the United States 
and 
North Korea will have better foreign relations and cooperative 
ties with each other, Japan and North Korea will establish 
diplomatic relations, Japan will pursue an independent line 
divorcing itself from the U.S.-Japan security arrangement and 
alliance, China will begin to assert its role as a mediator in 
military security in North East Asia, and Russia will propose 
to form a military alliance with any one country. This is a 
scenario that was hardly imaginable in the past. However, the 
problem is that the scenario is gradually approaching the realm 
of reality and it may become reality in the near future. The 
ROK-China-Japan triple alignment, that may emerge in the course 
of structural revamping of the international order in Northeast 
Asia, is bound to be radically different from the existing 
status quo-oriented bilateral form of cooperative relations 
currently perceived and being applied by these countries. 
  The difficulty in finding the direction for the development 
of the ROK- China-Japan triangular relationship lies in the 
necessity of considering not only short-term pragmatic 
objectives but also longterm goals. In view of the unsettled 
issue of North Korea's nuclear facilities, as well as the 
current North Korean economic condition and the attendant 
uncertainty in the security environment on the Korean 
Peninsula, it is very clear that the arrangement of the ROK- 
U.S. alliance will continue to prove effective. Considering the 
worldwide economic recession and the current economic situation 
in our country, we cannot neglect in the least our efforts to 
accelerate normal ROK-China economic exchanges and ROK-Japan 
economic cooperation in order to secure our country's 
competitiveness necessary for the continued buildup of national 
strength and future national development. 
  However, dealings between states are one thing and 
transactions between private firms are another. In dealings 
between states there are many aspects that cannot be measured 
in terms of monetary value. For instance, problems such as 
those involving national sovereignty, nationalism and national 
sentiments, the legitimacy and efficiency of the government, 
and the quality of the leadership are delicate problems in 
dealings between states. They have direct bearing on the future 
of bilateral or multilateral relations. From our point of view, 
the ROK-China-Japan triangular relationship is a matter that we 
need to handle by looking ten, twenty, or one-hundred years 
ahead. 
  If we are to chase two hares at the same time, namely, the 
pursuit of short-term national interests and the search for a 
forward-looking scheme of cooperation, it is imperative to 
change our way of thinking in establishing our foreign 
policies. The first requirement is to free ourselves from the 
conventional strategic view with which we have continued our 
"subservient diplomacy." In the period of the Sixth Republic 
our government advocated partnership relations with, and 
independent diplomacy toward, the United States as its goal. 
However, the "pragmatic view"--the view that security 
cooperation from the supposedly honest-minded hegemonic power 
is essential--still persists true to the age-old convention of 
subservient diplomacy, coupled with the alarm against the 
danger of invasion from North Korea. 
  Admittedly, our policies "in the style of subservient 
diplomacy" have greatly contributed to our national security in 
some aspects. However, a policy of dependence on foreign powers 
or a policy of inviting in foreign powers will be no longer 
helpful in turning our international environment to our 
advantage in the future; rather it will only serve as a 
structural impediment to the pace of our development. 
  Arguments about the rise and fall of U.S influence in 
Northeast Asian countries are intensifying as we move into the 
mid-1990's. To state my conclusion on the basis of many of these 
arguments, neither the United States, China, or Japan will be 
able to secure a hegemonic position in Northeast Asia. The 
reason is this: Ironically, all three have the ambition and 
potential to maintain hegemonism, and as a consequence, they 
will keep an eye on one another and try to hold one another in 
check. Accordingly, the international order in Northeast Asia 
is bound to continue for the time being in the form of 
maintaining the conventional balance of power by tacit 
multilateral agreement. 
  This situation offers the ROK the best opportunity to play 
an 
active role as a balancer in maintaining the balance of power. 
Under the circumstances in which the balance of power is 
actively at work, the economic and cultural competition among 
states will be a dominant factor in international politics, and 
countries with an eye toward the future will make every effort 
to consolidate their national foundations under the balance of 
power. At the same time, diverse forms of multilateral 
arrangements and dialogues will be developed actively through 
various channels. That is why we must make preparations now for 
that future. 
  What position will the United States, China, and Japan take 
under this new international order? Needless to say, the 
international order in Northeast Asia will for the time being, 
be characterized by the influence and role of the United 
States, the military superpower. However, the current condition 
of the United States, its foreign policy, and its recent moves 
suggest that "the time being" will not be too long. 
  Although the U.S. economy is on the way to recovery, the 
United States incurs a trade imbalance each year of nearly $100 
trillion and a fiscal deficit of $300 to $400 trillion. 
Accordingly, the curtailment of defense expenditure would not 
be completed in a short period of time (the defense cost may be 
reduced from 5 percent to 3 percent of the GNP for the next 10 
years); and the reduction of U.S. forces in this region will 
become inevitable as the scale of reduction in the defense cost 
is to be expanded to the Pacific region from Europe. Already 2 
years ago Holbrook, then U.S. assistant secretary for 
Asia-Pacific affairs, predicted that "U.S. troops will withdraw 
from Asia within 10 years." 
  President Clinton advocated a "new Pacific community" during 
his visit to Korea and Japan last year. Presiding over the APEC 
summit that took place subsequently, he admitted that the way 
out for the U.S. economy depends on the Asia-Pacific region in 
general and Northeast Asia in particular. More recently, he 
began to apply trade pressures by invoking Super 301. He has 
began to use the human rights issue as a diplomatic trump card 
against China. In the future the United States will enter 
willy-nilly into relations of competition and rivalry in 
Northeast Asia rather than keep on offering concessions and 
cooperation to China, Japan, and the ROK. 
  Under these circumstances, what outlook will Japan hold for 
the future? Up till now since its defeat in World War II, Japan 
has been able to concentrate on economic reconstruction thanks 
to the U.S.-Japan alliance. For the time being Japan will seek 
to promote stability and national interests while supporting 
the U.S. leadership in the international community. However, 
Japan's economic power has already reached the point where it 
is threatening to the U.S. leadership. The current deteriorated 
economic situation in Japan is prompting some critics to 
predict a very negative outlook for Japan. But the argument 
that Japan will surpass the United States in the 2000's is 
gaining ground. If Japan continues to allocate 1 percent of its 
GNP for its defense expenditure, Japan will have an edge over 
the United States in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of 
military expenditure in the early part of the 21st century. 
[passage omitted] 
  The problem involves the changes that will take place in the 
future in conjunction with the economic dispute between the 
United States and Japan, the territorial dispute between Russia 
and Japan, and the multilateral territorial dispute over the 
South sea Islands. Amid these changes, voices will mount in 
Japan demanding for an independent position in security, foreign 
relations, and economy and calling for the status of a 
political-military superpower, and this will be a major 
uncertainty factor in Japanese domestic politics. 
  Therefore, from the ROK's point of view, it should be able 
to 
lead the way in devising some ways to eliminate Japan's 
uncertainty. As a matter of fact, the ROK is not in a position 
to maintain a military strength superior to that of Japan nor 
to surpass Japan in national strength. This is why the ROK will 
have no choice but to exert efforts to work out a diplomatic 
strategy designed to take advantage of the peculiarities of 
international relationships in Northeast Asia instead of trying 
to deal with developments in this region in an emotional way. 
  In the economic field, Japan has already laid the groundwork 
for exercising its influence in the Southeast Asian region by 
providing economic development funds for and making direct 
investments in that region. Japan is also shifting the focus of 
its industrial and trade policy from Europe and the United 
States to East Asia. The ROK should be able to deal with and 
take advantage of this strategy. 
  China was a sleeping lion for the past 100 years or more 
under the domination of Western material culture. But awake 
from its long sleep, China is now building its body and 
sharpening its nails, determined to restore its grand posture 
as "the center of the universe." Since China adopted a reform 
and opening policy in the late 1970's in conformity with the 
Deng Xiaoping line, it has recorded marvelous economic growth. 
It achieved an annual GNP growth rate of 9.4 percent in the 
1980's, and entering the 1990's it has recorded an annual growth 
rate of over 10 percent despite the worldwide economic 
recession. The volume of its commodity exports is also 
increasing at an annual rate of 12.4 percent. [passage omitted] 
  Under an economic strategy seeking trade with the Western 
world and inducing investments from the outside world, China 
has pursued an economic policy "centering on the coastal 
region." The greatest problem China is facing now is the 
appalling gap between its coastal areas and the interior 
resulting from this policy. In the Chinese economic structure, 
foreign trade now accounts for more than 30 percent of the GNP. 
That is why China cannot but be susceptible to changes in the 
external environment. 
  From a mid-long term point of view, China is faced with the 
serious limitations inherent in "the socialist market economy." 
It is maintaining an iron-clad rule dominated by the communist 
party while pursuing a capitalist economic development 
strategy. The ideal of "equality" in income and distribution is 
gradually becoming passe. There is no telling when another 
democracy or liberalization movement will break out. 
  Nevertheless China's continuing rapid economic growth is 
having a tremendous influence on the process of establishing a 
new order in Northeast Asia. China began reducing its military 
strength in the 1980's, but entering the 1990's it began to add 
spurs to defense modernization by continually increasing its 
defense outlays. 
  China is particularly trying to develop, deploy, and sell 
high-tech weapons by using its military-industrial complex. 
Recently China has been found to be receiving various types of 
high-tech weapons and military technologies from Russia. As a 
result of the effort to rebuild its backward navy, many foreign 
observers maintain that the Chinese program for building an 
"oceangoing navy" is now getting into gear. 
  China contends that its defense modernization is for 
defensive purposes and it is no match for the United States or 
Japan. Yet China seems to believe that national strength not 
backed by military strength is hollow. One should see that 
behind its naval buildup is its intention to cope with the 
territorial dispute in the South China Sea on the one hand, and 
on the other hand to fill the power vacuum created by the U.S. 
withdrawal from Subic Bay and the weakened strength of the 
former Soviet Union's Far East Fleet. However, the ultimate 
goal of China's military buildup policy will be to counter the 
U.S.- Japan policy of maintaining a military balance in Asia. 
  Speaking of China's waxing economic influence in Asia, China 
is seeking to form an economic union called "the Zhonghua 
economic zone" by bringing together overseas Chinese in Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries. This raises the possibility 
that China will face diverse competition with Japan, which 
seeks to expand its economic influence in the Southeast Asian 
region. 
  Needless to say, considering the distinct gap between China 
and Japan in the levels of economic development, capital, and 
manpower, there will be a complex mixture of competition and 
cooperation as far as Asia is concerned. Accordingly, China 
will have no choice but to give weight to its economic 
cooperation with the ROK for the sake of countering Japan's 
leading position and for the sake of its own economic 
development. 
  China is ahead of the ROK in the fields of basic science and 
technology, but it is trailing the ROK in the commercialization 
of technologies. That is why China needs the ROK industrial 
system which has low capital-intensive features. China will 
also continually desire ROK participation in the economic 
development of the Chinese northeastern region. Therefore, the 
ROK should be able to take advantage of these diverse needs of 
China. 
  There are roughly two points that can be ascertained by the 
reality in the United States, China, and Japan and through a 
prognostication of their outlook for the future. One is that 
China and Japan will be recognized before long as world 
superpowers in all aspects--diplomatic, economic, and military, 
if the current pace of development should continue. However, 
viewed from the pragmatic point of view of forming a new order 
in Northeast Asia, if Japan and China should seek to gain a 
superior position against each other or seek regional 
hegemonism, it would invite direct check intervention by 
neighboring countries, aggravating the international discord. 
  The other point is that the ROK will be able to play the 
role 
of a balancer to maintain the balance of power in Northeast 
Asia, and by taking advantage of this position, to maximize its 
practical benefits as an intermediary. Needless to say, this 
optimistic view is based on the assumption that the 
relationship between North and South Korea will improve to the 
extent that the ROK may no longer be fettered by its North 
Korea policy. This assumption may well become a reality because 
the current political and economic condition in North Korea and 
the international environment will compel North Korea to behave 
reasonably. 
  If the above analysis is acceptable, our foreign policy 
option should be directed at bringing the Sino-Japanese 
relationship into our forward-looking strategy. To work out a 
new "ROK-China-Japan alignment," a shift to a "policy of active 
involvement" is needed. This is to say that we should do away 
with the past foreign policy of inviting in foreign powers. 
  The ROK can no longer be content with playing its role as a 
trumpeter of the U.S.-Asia policy. It should stand in the van 
of anti-hegemonism as the balancer of power in Northeast Asia. 
It should play an active role as arbiter of "positive peace" 
for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. To play this new 
role, it is imperative for the ROK to formulate its own foreign 
policy principles and for our people to have self-pride and 
stand ready to share as widely as possible whatever short term 
losses they may incur from abiding by these principles. 
  In international politics in Northeast Asia, the ROK should 
seek to form the framework of the "ROK-China-Japan triangular 
alignment" in such a way as to play its role as an arbitrator 
of international disputes, as a contact point for international 
interests, and as a mediator of international competition. To 
this end, our country should forge relationships of unswerving 
trust with other countries at the leadership and organizational 
levels. It is essential to pursue many-sided diplomacy by 
expanding the channels of private-level diplomacy. 
  With Kim Yong-sam's forthcoming visit to China and Japan as 
momentum, ROK-China and ROK-Japan economic cooperation is 
expected to accelerate. In the interest of this acceleration, 
our country is expected to exert efforts to make legal and 
structural improvements on the administrative level and expand 
methods of cooperation. On the basis of the successes that 
will be made in these efforts, the ROK should search for a more 
farsighted creative framework of economic exchange and mutual 
cooperation with China and Japan. What we need to do is map out 
a strategy for making investments in areas where we can 
exercise definite influence on some sectors of the Chinese and 
Japanese economies and forge the kind of mutual economic 
relationship by which we can get a grip on the weak links in 
the Japanese and Chinese economies, and on the other, to boldly 
invest our resources for the implementation of this strategy.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Kim Chang-Ki] </F>
  [Text] On 31 March President Kim invited National Assembly 
Speaker Yi Man-sop, Supreme Court Justice Yun Kwan, Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang; Cho Kyu-kwang, head of the Constitution 
Court; and Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the DLP, to a Blue House 
luncheon meeting to brief them on the results of his visit to 
Japan and China. 
  In a statement issued upon his return, President Kim said, 
"I 
shared the same view with the leaders of Japan and China that 
peace on the Korean Peninsula and unification are essential to 
security and prosperity in Northeast Asia." "My trip," he 
added, "has opened a new horizon for ROK-Japan and ROK-China 
cooperation." 
  Said President Kim: "It was my impression that Japan is 
running in the front and China is drawing a huge dragon picture 
of itself." He then stressed that "we must continue our efforts 
for change, reform, and internationalization without 
interruption in the rapidly changing world tide." 
  Earlier, on the morning of 31 March before leaving Beijing, 
President Kim held an over-breakfast press conference for Korean 
correspondents stationed in Beijing. On his way home he visited 
the exclusive ROK section in the Tianjin economic and 
technological development district to inspect Korean firms and 
give words of encouragement to its employees. 
  During the press conference over breakfast, the president 
said: "I have a firm conviction that we will prevail over North 
Korea without a fight, and I am confident that we can maintain 
security and peace on the Korean Peninsula." 
  At the same press conference for the Korean press corps in 
Beijing, President Kim said, "During my meetings with President 
Jiang Zemin and other top Chinese leaders, I fully briefed them 
on our government's position toward North Korea." Said the 
president: "During my visit to China, I convinced the Chinese 
leaders that the ROK has no intention whatsoever of annexing 
North Korea for the unification of country by absorption or to 
isolate North Korea, but has instead a strong determination to 
support the North Korean position in the international 
community and assist North Korea on our own." 
  The president stressed: "We must get ready to play an 
important role as a member of the international community. The 
international community is no longer in a position to ignore 
the ROK in its decision making." He added, "in maintaining 
peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and settling 
problems such as North Korea's nuclear issue, close cooperation 
among the neighboring countries including the United States, 
Japan, China, and Russia is essential." 
  While explaining the results of the summit meeting between 
him and President Jiang Zemin, President Kim said: "I received 
the impression that China attaches great importance not only to 
the issue of North Korea 's nuclear capability but also to 
peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast 
Asia as a whole, and takes the position that responsible 
dialogue between the highest leaders of North and South Korea 
is particularly vital to settling all problems." He thus 
strongly hinted at the possibility that China will play a more 
active role in materializing a summit meeting between North and 
South Korea. 
  With regard to the question of President Jiang Zemin's 
chances of visiting the ROK, President Kim said: "We discussed 
the matter fully during the summit meeting with President Jiang 
Zemin and the reception, and I believe that he will visit the 
ROK." The president thus hinted that President Jiang Zemin will 
pay an official visit to South Korea in the latter part of this 
year. 
  Regarding the question of forming a Northeast Asian economic 
cooperation machinery, President Kim said, "With the expansion 
of ROK- China industrial cooperation as a momentum, economic 
cooperation between the two countries will proceed at a rapid 
pace." "I confirmed," added the president, "that China has a 
strong desire to promote economic cooperation with our country."

  [Text] On the basis of its judgment that the construction 
of nuclear waste storage sites--whose selection has been delayed 
because of opposition by local residents--can no longer be 
postponed, the government has planned to decide on candidate 
sites during the latter half of this year before beginning 
construction next year. 
  One high-level government official said on 22 May: "In 
connection with the selection of sites, the government has thus 
far conducted public relations activities for local residents 
with a view to pushing ahead with construction, on a priority 
basis, with the consent of those residents who want to have such 
a site built in their area. But, as seen in the large-scale 
demonstrations in Yangsan County, South Kyongsang Province, we 
have come to judge that the beginning of construction based on 
residents' consent is realistically impossible. In this regard, 
the government will make public its selection of sites during 
the latter half of this year before beginning construction early 
next year." 
  The same official added that in order to minimize residents' 
backlash against the selection of sites, the government has been 
trying to provide support for regional development 
plans--including projects whose materialization the residents 
have long aspired for their own areas' benefit--and to legislate 
relevant enforcement ordinances for guaranteeing jobs for the 
residents' livelihood, saying that all these government efforts 
are now at a final stage. He made clear the policy of pushing 
ahead with construction by saying: "Despite some residents' 
opposition, we will have no choice but to carry through the 
construction even by exercising government power." 
  He continued to say: "At the moment, nuclear waste coming 
from atomic power plants is being stored at the individual 
plants. But, it will reach a saturation point in 1999. It 
takes at least five to seven years to build a nuclear waste 
storage site. Therefore, it is a pressing question for us to 
begin construction early next year after making a final decision 
on construction sites within this year at the latest." 
  It has been learned that at present the government is 
searching for candidate sites among six areas, such as Anmyon 
Island, South Chungchong Province; Uljin and Yongil, North 
Kyongsang Province; Changhung, South Cholla Province; Kosong, 
Kangwon Province; and Yangsan, South Kyongsang Province--the 
sites a research team of Seoul National University has 
proposed--and among the areas where the existing atomic power 
plants are located. 
  Since the residents in the Yangsan area near the Kori Atomic 
Power Plant showed an interest in having such a site built in 
their area, the government has conducted public relations 
activities for them. But, in spite of the fact that more than 
80 percent of the area's residents have consented to having such 
a site built in their area, there have been demonstrations 
staged by some residents and outside forces such as 
environmental organizations. As a result, the government 
officially expressed its stance of giving up the construction of 
a site in that area on 22 May.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- State-owned assets are 
approaching 65 trillion won (89.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 
value, according to a report by the Finance Ministry issued 
Tuesday. 
  They were valued at 64.43 trillion won as of last year, up 4 
percent or 2.47 trillion won from a year earlier. 
  Assets owned by the administrative agencies such as 
government buildings, state-run or public schools and 
corporations, increased 4.8 percent in value to 44.37 trillion 
won. 
  Cultural assets, historic relics and other properties being 
conserved amounted to 729.1 billion won (up 0.9 percent). 
  Land was valued at 32.73 trillion won, up 2.8 percent; 
securities at 15.26 trillion won, up 2 percent; buildings at 
7.04 trillion won, up 11.4 percent; and equipment at 6.21 
trillion won, up 7.6 percent. 
  Trees stood at 1.96 trillion won, up 1.7 percent; 
non-military ships and aircraft at 334.5 billion won, up 58 
percent; and immaterial properties like patents at 51.5 billion 
won, up 12.7 percent. 
  Machinery assets decreased 4.2 percent to 835.3 billion won 
due to depreciation. 
  State assets and conserved properties are administered by 50 
government agencies and miscellaneous assets by 15 cities and 
districts, but the value of public assets such as cash, roads, 
rivers and ports was not included as national assets as they are 
difficult to estimate, the ministry said.

Tower"] 
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam on 25 May received a report 
from Navy Chief of Staff Kim Hong-yol on his promotion to 
four-star admiral and affixed a badge of rank to him. By this, 
President Kim filled all the nine posts of four-star generals of 
the ROK Armed Forces with the generals he himself promoted and 
appointed. Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said, "All the 
three-star generals who number over 20 are also those whom 
President Kim promoted." 
  The three- and four-star generals reported their promotion 
at 
Chongwadae [presidential offices], with President Kim himself 
affixing the badge of rank to them. Therefore, all the senior 
generals of the Armed Forces have become 'President Kim's 
generals.' 
  Spokesman Chu said, "A considerable number of two-star 
generals have also been promoted or appointed to their present 
posts by President Kim. This shows how rapidly reform in the 
military has been carried out." Spokesman Chu added, "This 
concludes the personnel actions for military reform." 
  President Kim, receiving a report from Navy Chief of Staff 
Kim and sharing coffee with him, said, "I am gratified that the 
military is keeping step with the new order of reform and change 
and is carrying out its duties well in a stable condition." He 
added, "Only the Navy's chief of staff was a three-star admiral, 
while the chiefs of staff of the Army and Air Force were 
four-star generals. This imbalance has now been resolved."

  [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The Justice Ministry has 
decided to simplify procedures for foreigners seeking permission 
to live in Korea, including extending the period of stay from 
the present three years to four years, officials said Wednesday. 
  The new procedures will go into effect July 1. 
  Extension of the period of stay will apply to foreign 
journalists, missionaries and other religious workers, company 
employees and investors in businesses, they said. 
  The ministry will also simplify the papers required to 
invite 
foreigners and other attached documents, the officials said. 
  In addition, the ministry will issue an approval paper for 
visa issuance (a kind of letter of invitation) to foreign 
science technicians, professors, religious workers and 
businessmen. Until now, the paper had been issued only to 
foreign interns for technological training here. 
  Under the new procedures, the approval paper could be 
obtained from the ministry's immigration office by prospective 
Korean employers of foreigners. Thereupon, Korean embassies 
would issue visa to those who file approval papers. 
  Foreigners who wanted to live in Korea for employment 
previously had to submit applications at Korean embassies for 
approval from the Justice Ministry. 
  The ministry also required foreign religious or social 
workers aged 50 or older to leave the country at the end of a 
certain period of time to seek re-entry. But from now on, they 
would be allowed to stay permanently. 
  Moreover, from July 1 the ministry will stop checking 
departing foreigners individually and instead let them be 
screened by automatic passport reading machinery. The ministry 
plans to install 43 of the machines, initially at Kimpo airport, 
with plans to equip all international airports and ports by 1996.

  [Text] Taegu, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Kim Sang-hyon of the 
opposition Democratic Party, said here on Tuesday Kim Tae-chung, 
chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, will return to 
active politics if there is a nationwide support for him. "If 
there is nationwide support for him and if need be, Chairman Kim 
should return to active politics and he himself will," he said. 
  Kim Sang-hyon was one of Kim Tae-chung's closest confidants 
for many years once in the past. 
  In a special lecture at a political science and 
international 
relations class of Kyongbuk National University, Kim added, 
however, that since Chairman Kim commands outstanding political 
senses, he won't return to politics unless there is a widespread 
support for him or there are conditions warranting his return to 
politics. 
  Kim Tae-chung himself said time and again that he had 
retired 
from politics for good and he would never come back to 
politicking.

  [Text] With the local elections slated for next year, 
unifying all opposition forces is becoming a matter of interest 
to the opposition parties. DP President Yi Ki-taek has seized 
every opportunity to stress the need for unifying the 
opposition camp, assuring that he will make every effort for 
this purpose. UNP President Kim Tong-kil, NKP President Yi 
Chong-chan, and Pak Chan- chong, head of the New Party for 
Political Renewal [NPPR] are all stressing the need for 
bringing the opposition forces together, although there are 
shades of difference in the substance of their statements. Yi 
Ki-taek, Kim Tong-kil, and Yi Chong-chan met on 16 April and 
agreed in principle to a three-party merger of the DP, UNP, and 
NKP. 
  However, the road to a unified opposition party is far from 
smooth. Each party has a different goal for and a different 
interest in the proposed merger. Even in the same party the 
opinions of the factions are as much different as their 
interests and emotions are. 
  The opposition camp consists of the existing opposition 
political parties (the DP, the UNP, the NKP, and NPPR) and 
dissident groups. Naturally, the party that will become the 
center for the merger of the opposition forces is the DP, the 
first opposition party. Within the DP there are roughly three 
different views among its factions regarding the opposition 
merger issue. The mainstream, consisting of the followers of DP 
President Yi Ki-taek and the Tonggyodong faction, regards it as 
the primary goal to merge the DP, the UNP, and the NKP into 
one. It is also searching for ways to bring the dissident group 
led by Kim Kun-tae, who is preparing to organize a group called 
the "Society for Political Renewal," into a unified opposition 
party. NPPR President Pak Chan-chong, whose goal is to become 
the "prince of the opposition camp," is excluded for the time 
being. 
  However, NPPR President Pak Chan-chong is included, in 
addition to the UNP and the NKP, in the targets of an 
opposition merger as conceived by the DP non-mainstream led by 
Standing Advisor Kim Sang-hyon. The nonmainstream also calls 
for the inclusion of all dissident forces including Kim Kun-tae 
in the merger of the opposition forces. It is also discussing 
role sharing between the DP and civic groups. It is studying 
ways for the DP's area-by-area coalescence with civic groups in 
areas such as environment, pollution, education, and rural 
problems. In brief, its idea is to organize a united "anti-DLP" 
force through an opposition-wide merger or coalition. 
  DP Supreme Council Member Cho Se-Hyong has a similar 
opinion. He conceives of a "platform formula" by which the 
existing political parties, dissident groups, and civic 
organizations formulate a joint platform and policy with the DP 
at the center and join forces under this platform and policy. 
This idea is similar to the "idea of forming a non-LDP 
coalition government" in Japan. 
  On the other hand, the Society of Political Reform, a group 
of dissident-turned National Assembly members, attaches greater 
importance to the DP's merging with the dissident forces than 
the merger of the existing three opposition parties. The group 
takes the position that in turning the DP into a reform force, 
it is more desirable to bring together the DP and the dissident 
forces as a whole than to have dissident figures join the DP 
individually. 
  In this connection, DP assemblymen Yi Pu-yong, Yim 
Chae-Chong, Che Chong-ku, and three dissident figures, namely, 
Yi Chang-pok, Chang Ki- pyo, and Kim Kun-tae, launched a forum 
tentatively named "the New Age Plaza" on 13 April. Their 
purpose in organizing this forum is to "bring the dissident 
forces together for reform and national unification." 
  The UNP is divided over the opposition merger issue with its 
assemblymen having different views. There is one faction that 
has a positive view of the DP-led merger of the opposition 
camp. Its president, Kim Tong-kil, is the key figure of this 
faction. There is also an independent faction which calls for 
the formation of a UNP-centered third party. The idea of this 
faction is to organize a third party by joining forces with the 
NPPR led by Pak Chong-chan. The advocates of this idea is 
called the school of strengthening or reinventing the UNP. 
Assemblyman Han Yong-su is at the center of this school. UNP 
President Kim Tong-kil has signed for now, but he is not too 
keen about this idea. 
  The third faction favors the preservation of the UNP, 
namely, the merger of the opposition camp centering on the UNP. 
This faction takes a passive or negative attitude toward the 
idea of creating a third party by joining forces with the NPPR. 
This faction consists mainly of former DLP members. President 
Yi Chong-chan and assemblyman Chang Kyong-u of the NKP has a 
positive stance toward the merger of the opposition camp 
centering on the DP. 
  NPPR President Pak Chan-chong is searching ways for a merger 
with some members of the UNP while advocating an "anti-DLP, 
anti-DP" cause. He demands an end to "politics by two Kims," 
namely, ROK President Kim Yong-sam and Kim Tae-chung, board 
chairman of the Asia-Pacific Foundation, and shift in 
generation. To this end, he demands that President Kim withdraw 
from the DLP, and that Kim Tae-chung completely give up his 
idea of staging a political comeback by using the DP as a 
foothold. Pak Chan-chong says that he will organize a planning 
group in April to push forward with his plan. He has 
practically no interest in a DP-centered merger of the 
opposition forces. 
  Dissident figure Kim Kun-tae plans to launch a preparatory 
committee for the "Society for Political Renewal" on or about 
23 April to consolidate the internal unity of the dissident 
camp as an alternate political force. 
  The road to the merger of the opposition forces is far from 
smooth because as you see, different parties, and even 
different factions in each party, have their own ideas about 
merging the opposition forces, depending on their interests. 
Some DP members, a sort of vested interest group, have a 
negative view of the merger of the opposition. Those who have 
grown up as party bureaucrats in the DP are particularly 
against the idea because they fear that a merger of the 
opposition parties or the dissident forces will weaken their 
"position." 
  Some DP assemblymen fear that a wrong step in merging the 
opposition forces might give birth to an "anti-DLP, anti-DP 
party." In this event, they fear, the purpose of bringing the 
opposition forces together as a counterbalance to the mammoth 
government party would be defeated. It would become a case of 
"go for wool and come home shorn." 
  Another factor that makes the merger of the opposition 
forces difficult is the fact that the DP does not have a 
decisive enough strength to be at the center of the opposition 
camp. 
  In the case of the UNP, the amount of subsidy it receives 
from the national treasure has drastically increased as a 
result of the new legislation for political reform. This poses 
another obstacle to the merger of the opposition forces. Next 
year the UNP will receive a subsidy of 10.9 billion won in 
connection with four local elections. Even now the party has 
little financial trouble thanks to the state subsidy exceeding 
200 million won. Still, it will receive a far larger sum of 
subsidy next year. 
  Some UNP assemblymen such as Yi Cha-hon and Kim Yong-hwan 
are against the UNP's merger with the DP because of their 
temperament. Assemblymen from the Taegu-Kyongbuk area, 
including Yu Su-ho and Kim Pok-tong, feel the same way. 
  Nevertheless it is questionable whether the move for the 
formation of a third party by some of the UNP members and NPPR 
President Pak Chan-chon will proceed smoothly. Pak insists that 
he should be both the head of the new party to be organized and 
its presidential candidate in the 15th presidential election. 
This demand will place the greatest obstacle in the way of 
organizing a third party. 
  While searching for ways of merging with the UNP and the 
NKP, the DP is contacting some of the UNP assemblymen 
separately just in case the efforts for merger are aborted and 
UNP members join the DP individually. The targets are those UNP 
assemblymen who are in favor of or at least not opposed to 
joining the DP. 
  The DP expects that as next year's local elections draw 
near, the atmosphere will grow more and more in favor of the 
merger of the opposition forces and the merger issue will 
become an active topic. But the DP thinks that the conditions 
are not yet ripe.

<F P=106> [By Manan Osman and S. Jayakrishna] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Mon. -- The Pacific community must 
not be inward-oriented and discriminatory towards the rest of 
the world, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said 
today. He said they must be open to the world, to exports, and 
investments technology and comprehensive economic penetration of 
the rest of the world. 
  "We would be foolish if we of the Pacific get together in 
order to circle our wagons to raise the barricades and to keep 
everyone else out," he said in his keynote address at the 27th 
International General Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic 
Council (PBEC) at Shangri-la Hotel. 
  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Colombian Minister 
of Foreign Trade Dr. Juan Manuel Santos also addressed the 
meeting, which has as its theme "Profiting from Pacific 
Dynamism: Opportunities and Challenges for the Private Sector." 
  More than 700 participants, including economic ministers and 
top businessnen from the Asia-Pacific region are taking part in 
the three-day meeting held here for the first time. 
  "Our Pacific Era must so be built upon the firm foundation 
of 
a liberalising Pacific economic system that is fast reducing the 
obstacles to the flow of goods and services," Dr. Mahathir said. 
  "We owe it to the world and to ourselves to also proceed on 
the basis of lowering the obstacles to businesses located 
outside the Pacific Rim. A mercantilist Pacific makes as much 
sense as a mercantilist Canada or a mercantilist Japan or a 
mercantilist United States." 
  Dr. Mahathir said even as the Pacific community was 
committed 
to open regionalism at the global level and open 
superregionalism at the Pacific level, it must be committed to 
open regionalism in all the various regional schemes which they 
embarked upon. 
  He said the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and 
the free trade area between Australia and New Zealand (Anzcerta) 
must all seek to reduce the barriers to external economies as 
well as the participating member states. He said the same must 
hold for whatever was tried in East Asia. 
  "The East Asian scheme or economic cooperation, including 
the 
East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), which has been the victim of 
so much deliberate misinformation, must be wedded to this idea 
of open regionalism." 
  Dr. Mahathir said peace and stability were essential 
prerequisites for the Pacific Age. He said that without peace 
and stability, all the basic assumptions of progress had to go 
back to the drawing board. 
  "Fortunately for us in the Pacific, not perhaps for 15 years 
has the strategic environment been so conducive for peace and 
stability. In so many parts of the Pacific peace and stability 
have already broken out or are being strenghtened." 
  He said he was aware of the conflict potential in the Korean 
peninsula that could change the entire strategic picture and 
future of the Pacific. 
  "I know of the possibility of the division of Canada. I am 
aware of the issues in Mexico and some of the internal security 
concerns in North and Central America. But I am confident that 
China will not break up that the Japanese are not going to lose 
their sense and there will be no violent maritime conflict in 
the region. All these and other security issues will be thrown 
up in the course of time and cannot be dealt with the old 
mindset of confrontation power and deterrence which can never 
create warm and cooperative peace, which can only guarantee the 
rigidifying of a status quo and the vicious circle of enmity, 
armament suspicion, and hatred." 
  Dr. Mahathir said there were now tremendous opportunities to 
go by a different path, to cooperate with those whom one 
disagreed or whom one had yet to come to an agreement. He said 
there were so many opportunities to work with those whose 
perspectives and interests differed from one's own yet presented 
possibilities of harmonisation, or at worst, an agreement to 
agree to disagree without being disagreeable. 
  He urged Pacific countries to work together intimately and 
diligently to build a Pacific Peace "worthy of the name of the 
ocean which washes our shores." 
  He said it also seemed somewhat obvious that the Pacific 
countries should build not only a community of cooperative peace 
but also mutual prosperity. 
  Dr. Mahathir said he believed that there were at least two 
pillars for such an endeavour which should be stressed at this 
point in time. 
  "The first is to ensure a Pacific market system which 
unleashes the ferocious force of enterprise and catalyses all 
the synergistic potential of the Pacific, and the second is to 
ensure the development of a Pacific economic system firmly 
wedded to open regionalism. We have seen the bankruptcy of the 
central command economy. On the other hand, we have seen what 
can be done when markets are opened and liberated and when goods 
and services are freed to respond to the commands of the 
marketplace rather than the specific targets and dictates of 
bureaucrats, planners, and politicians. We have seen what China 
has been able to achieve, what Vietnam has been able to 
accomplish. We should seek the further opening of the 
transition economies and the wedding of all our economies to the 
market system. However macho we are on the Pacific, we must 
never forget the global community. I believe we must escape the 
trap that has been a source of weakness in Western Europe. It 
is very difficult to find Europeans who believe that they are 
incredibly Eurocentric. At the same time, I am confident most 
of you will agree with me when I say that it is difficult to 
find Europeans who are not in fact, whether they know it or not, 
incredibly Eurocentric." 
  Dr. Mahathir also reminded Pacific countries that the 
Pacific 
Era would be still born if they quarrelled and fought among 
themselves or divided the Pacific or created discriminatory 
trading blocs, drew a line down the Pacific, or unwilling to 
extend to each other the normal rules and regulations -- like 
the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status -- that were the norms 
between trading economies. 
  He added that to try to build a Pacific community along the 
lines of the European Community would be extremely disruptive 
and damaging to the long-term building of a Pacific community.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] On the question of the 
East Timor Conference, I affirm once more that the Philippine 
Government has acted -- as it will always act -- in accordance 
with the national interest. 
  Being geographic neighbors and ASEAN partners, the 
Philippines and Indonesia share certain long-term interests as I 
have said before. Among those interests is the maintenance of 
the peace and stability of our region and the pursuit of further 
regional development. These are essential for us to realize our 
hopes for the continued progress and prosperity of all our 
peoples. Respect for one another's territorial integrity; 
noninterference in one another's internal affairs, and the ASEAN 
practice of quiet, bilateral, and regional dialogue are the 
tried and tested tools that have helped us maintain the 
stability that we now enjoy in Southeast Asia. 
  In this context, therefore, let our discussions on this 
question with Indonesia take their course in the ASEAN way. 
  The Philippines and Indonesia have many other common 
objectives to pursue and we should do so, keeping our long-term 
interests in mind. [passage omitted] 
  I also would like to reiterate our previous statement in 
regard to our attachment of great importance to the ARF -- the 
ASEAN Regional Forum -- which is scheduled to meet on 25 July in 
Bangkok. Right now, the senior officials of ASEAN are meeting 
preparatory to the ministerial meeting. 
  The ARF is a key initiative and an unprecedented forum for 
it 
brings together practically all the countries in the region for 
the first time -- even those outside ASEAN -- to discuss 
regional security items of common concern in the Asia-Pacific 
region. The ASEAN countries plus Australia, Canada, China, the 
European Union, Korea, Japan, Laos, New Zealand, Papua New 
Guinea, Russia, United States, and Vietnam are all ARF 
participants. 
  The Philippines has been one of the leading advocates 
promoting greater regional security dialogue. And since the end 
of the Cold War, the Philippines has believed that the countries 
of the region must take advantage of the new opportunities to 
jointly talk about security issues that in the past had been 
treated in a less comprehensive manner. 
  In the meeting currently being held in Bangkok, we have 
called on our fellow ASEAN partners to move the forum into a 
much more closely coordinated body. 
  On the U.S. grant of MFN status to China, which according to 
reports is at the point of decision making, we have this 
statement: We would like to reiterate the established position 
of the Philippine Government supporting the continued grant of 
most favored nation or MFN status to China. China is now a 
major trading nation, of increasingly important significance not 
just to the United States but to all countries of the 
Asia-Pacific region including the Philippines. At the same 
time, in line with this economic modernization policy, Beijing 
has shown greater openness toward the regional economy -- 
reflecting that China, too, needs its friends abroad for its 
continued growth and prosperity. This is an extremely positive 
development that benefits the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. 
  The Philippines, as do many other countries, does not 
believe 
in linking trade with nontrade or political issues. We believe 
trade and economic issues should be separated from nontrade and 
political issues such as human rights. Otherwise, there is the 
danger that strong countries might impose all manner of 
political conditionalities on the smaller members of the global 
trading community. This is a situation we would want to avoid 
where such conditionalities might easily be used as new forms of 
protectionism. 
  I would like to emphasize that because there is an editorial 
in one of our leading newspapers today -- I will not show the 
masthead anymore, please do your own research -- castigating the 
president and the government for issuing that first statement a 
few days ago as if we have nothing to do in that issue. Well, I 
explained in this statement that a prosperous China is good for 
the development of the entire Asia-Pacific region, including our 
own. But better than that, a prosperous and stable China is to 
our own national interest as well as to the mutual regional 
interest of everyone in the region. [passage omitted]

Canberra today voted to oust Dr. John Hewson from the leadership 
by 43 votes to 36: 
  [Begin Mottram recording] The result finally ends the 
troubled leadership of John Hewson, installing instead the 
42-year-old former Oxford scholar Alexander Downer, a third 
generation politician and the first ever leader of the Liberal

so-called youth ticket, Liberal MP's also voted for a change of 
deputy leader, replacing Dr. Michael Wooldridge with the 
45-year-old finance spokesman, Peter Costello. 
  Liberal leader Downer has promised a broad policy statement 
in the near future, and he wants to trim the size of Dr. 
Hewson's bloated shadow ministry. Mr. Downer had been touting 
his leadership as a chance for a fresh start for a party out of 
government for more than a decade. 
  John Hewson's future in politics remains to be clarified.

<F P=106> [Article by Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox </F>
Company, Ltd.: "Proposal on New Joint Government-Private Sector 
Japan-U.S. Summit"] 
  [Text] The Only Ways To Reduce Surplus: Numerical 
Targets or Price Adjustment 
  There have been bewildering changes in Japan-U.S. relations 
since the recent breakdown of the bilateral summit -- rapid 
appreciation of the yen right after the summit, the USTR [U.S. 
Trade Representative] mention of sanctions over the mobile phone 
issue, a quick political solution to this issue, and revival of 
the Super 301 provision. And then, on 8 April, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was 
designated his successor. Later, the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] left the coalition, a minority cabinet was formed, 
and there have been strong signs of an approaching political 
realignment. The effect of this on Japan-U.S. relations can be 
considerable. 
  For the U.S. Government, since it was expecting continuity 
in 
foreign policy and the trade negotiations, and was anticipating 
the installation of a pragmatic cabinet even before Hata was 
elected prime minister, it was somewhat reassured. However, the 
SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition came as a great surprise, 
even though it had been believed all along that such an event 
would come sooner or later. Undoubtedly, this has greatly 
enhanced the U.S. feeling of anxiety about Japan. 
  How do we find a way out of this situation? More than 
anything else, the Japanese people should realize that "the 
framework talks' purpose is to see a tangible reduction in 
Japan's surplus. There are only two ways to do this: reduce the 
surplus numerically or through price adjustment. If we refuse 
to do it numerically, appreciation of the yen will be the 
inevitable consequence." Toward this end, while numerical 
targets would be out of the question at the microeconomic level, 
in macroeconomics, it would be advisable for the government to 
indicate its political will through numerical targets for the 
ratio of current account surplus to gross domestic product, or 
for efforts to narrow the price gap between Japan and foreign 
countries. Furthermore, in macroeconomic policy, measures that 
will have obvious and "impressive" effects in stimulating the 
economy, such as adding another 100 trillion yen to the 430 
trillion yen public investment program, or implementing income 
tax reductions for at least three years in advance [before 
implementing the consumption tax hike]--which the Keizai Doyukai 
[Japan Association of Corporate Executives] has suggested--will 
be necessary. With regard to deregulation, a concrete and 
effective list should be compiled as soon as possible, and a 
powerful third- party watchdog organ should also be established. 
<H5>  Applying the Objective Criteria Is Japan's Job </H5>
  A certain measure of progress will also be needed on the 
issue of numerical targets or objective criteria, which was the 
immediate cause for the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit and 
the framework talks. Specifically, Japan has to make the United 
States pledge not to demand numerical targets for each 
individual sector. President Bill Clinton and responsible U.S. 
negotiators repeatedly made statements to this effect at the 
news conference after the summit meeting and on other occasions. 
It would be possible to make this an official commitment. 
  On the other hand, with regard to objective criteria, it 
should be possible to quantify and measure the relationship 
between the degree of "acceptance" of products and services--for 
instance, degree of customer satisfaction--and the degree of 
"penetration" in each other's market in the past and at present. 
It would also be possible to compare and evaluate the tempo of 
the penetration and expansion of U.S. products and services in 
Japan in terms of similar applicable indices in other markets. 
  It would just be rational to reach prior agreement that: 
Through a comparison of the degree of "acceptance" at a future 
point in time with that of the present, or through a comparison 
of U.S. products with similar products from Japan and other 
countries, if a positive change can be confirmed, this will be 
taken to mean a corresponding progress in the penetration and 
expansion of such products in the Japanese market. It would 
certainly be possible to evaluate the relationship between 
actual degree of "acceptance" and "penetration" when that 
"future point in time" is reached, or even in the course of 
reaching such a point. 
  While the United States is responsible for giving up its 
demand on sector-specific numerical targets, it is Japan's job 
to take the initiative in the matter of applying objective 
criteria. If objective criteria are used in the above-described 
manner, this cannot be termed managed trade. The important 
thing is, such an evaluation process should be conducted as an 
independent activity of the private sector in all areas, except 
for the "government-reach" sectors (sectors under government 
jurisdiction). 
  The World Is Looking At Japan and the United States 
  It must not be forgotten that, in building a new world order 
after the Cold War, Asia and the world look to Japan and the 
United States to exercise responsible, mature leadership. One 
issue here is domestic reforms in Japan. Another is Japan-U.S. 
relations, specifically, the solution of economic issues between 
the two countries not only from a bilateral perspective, but 
also dealing with them with a shared common perception between 
the two countries from a multilateral perspective. 
  In this regard, Japan and the United States can experiment 
on 
the new approach of holding a joint "new Japan-U.S. summit" for 
both the governments and the private sectors of both countries 
to reach a responsible conclusion in economic negotiations, and 
to discuss major mid- and long-term bilateral issues. 
  Japan and the United States hold summits twice a year. One 
of these can be held as a joint government-private sector summit 
alternately in Japan and the United States. If the boundary 
between government and private-sector meetings is demolished, 
leaders of the governments and private sectors in both 
countries, headed by the prime minister and the president, can 
sit down at the same conference table and build a consensus on 
bilateral issues of common concern. Such a venue may be able to 
come up with more coherent and more consistent solutions to 
various problems. 
  In any case, time is running out. We certainly hope that 
Prime Minister Hata will exercise strong leadership to resolve 
the pending issues between Japan and the United States by taking 
the initiative in the issue of objective criteria, as discussed 
above, and by adopting the new approach to bilateral summits.

  [Text] An agreement was reached at the Uruguay Round (new 
multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT) to liberalize 
imports of milk products. In this regard, it has been disclosed 
that the Japanese Government reached "secret accords" with 
United States and Australia, in deciding to import amounts of 
certain products which the United States and Australia produce 
more of than do other countries, in the face of the 
liberalization. The accords will be linked to giving priority 
to actual purchases of certain milk products from both 
countries. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 
[MAFF] denies the allegation, saying that "we did not promise 
that we would import the goods from both countries." However, it 
is believed that the secret accords are de facto "import 
guarantees." Therefore, it is expected that other milk-product 
exporting nations will voice opposition. 
  So far the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation [LIPC] 
has imported all types of milk products, including butter and 
skim milk, to satisfy domestic demand. Following the Uruguay 
Round agreement, importers will be able to freely import milk 
products starting in 1995 if they pay high tariffs. At the same 
time, the LIPC will be allowed to import 137,202 tons of milk 
products annually with low tariffs as part of minimum access. 
  Of the LIPC's import quota, 20,000 to 30,000 tons will be 
allocated to a milk product called whey, which is used in bread 
and confections, according to the accord with the United States 
which was agreed to last year at the bilateral Japan-U.S. talks. 
Because the United States is strongly competitive in the 
production of whey, the agreement may become a de facto 
guarantee for its import from the United States. According to 
the MAFF, Japan has not imported whey from the United States 
since 1988. 
  Japan promised Australia in March that it would import 
butter 
and skim milk from that country in amounts equivalent to at 
least three-fourths of the LIPC's total imports of butter and 
skim milk. Japan and Australia have exchanged an informal 
document that stipulates: 1) Japan will decide on the import 
volume of butter and skim milk every year after considering the 
domestic demand, and 2) Japan and Australia will hold 
governmental dairy product negotiations every year and exchange 
information on the milk products trade. It can be said that the 
informal document is a de facto guarantee for imports from 
Australia. The MAFF, however, has never made public the 
informal document. 
  Commenting on the secret accord concluded between Japan and 
the United States, a Japanese official in charge of the Uruguay 
Round negotiations said, "Japan and the United States agreed at 
the end of their negotiations on opening the Japanese rice 
market to postpone implementation of rice `tariffication,' and 
Japan has conceded to the United States on whey." 
  In principle, GATT bans country-by-country import quotas, 
but 
it permits the import quota system if all nations involved agree 
on the import quota system. As for the secret Japan-U.S. accord 
and the secret Japan-Australia accord, the MAFF has not notified 
GATT of them, and the MAFF says, "The accords do not constitute 
a country-by-country import quota."

  [Text] A top Foreign Ministry official commented on the 
evening of 24 May on the possibility of a visit by Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa to the United States in view of the 
agreement to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. He 
indicated that there is very little possibility that the U.S. 
visit can materialize before the OECD executive ministerial 
committee meeting in early June. 
  This source also disclosed that Kakizawa told U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor during a telephone 
conversation on the same evening that an early trip to the 
United States would be unlikely, and that the two men agreed 
that Japan and the United States should consider holding a 
foreign ministerial meeting during the OECD meeting in Paris on 
7 and 8 June.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] A sensation has been caused by your 
statement to the effect that "a general election should be held 
just once under the current multiseat constituency system 
through dissolution of the Diet by mutual consent." 
  [Murayama] We favored political reform bills and they were 
subsequently approved by the Diet. It is natural that a general 
election should be held under a new election system if a new 
constituency map is made. However, this does not mean that the 
Diet cannot be dissolved unless a new constituency map is drawn 
up. When pending problems at home and abroad cannot be solved, 
there is no other way but a general resignation of the cabinet 
or a dissolution of the Diet. To listen to the will of the 
public, the supreme leaders, and to make a fresh start, without 
a mere rotation of the reins of government through dissolution, 
are regular procedures of constitutional government. Some 
people label those who favor dissolution of the Diet and a 
general election under the current multiseat constituency system 
as people who are intent on crushing political reform. However, 
the nation will suffer a misfortune when the current minority 
administration comes to a standstill but general elections are 
prevented from taking place under whatever circumstances. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of the SDPJ 
submitting a no-confidence motion against the cabinet? 
  [Murayama] We will make our judgment after fully grasping 
how the Hata administration conducts the affairs of state. We 
are not bound by the fact that we voted Mr. Hata prime minister. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your stance toward the Hata 
administration? 
  [Murayama] So long as the Hata administration takes over the 
reformist line of the Hosokawa administration and promotes it, 
we are ready to cooperate with it where cooperation is possible. 
However, if the character of the Hata administration changes, 
that will alter the case. We will take responsibility for the 
budget bill and the bills related to the budget that we drew up 
jointly when we were in the coalition government. As to matters 
thereafter, we will adopt a free and unbiased policy. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What does the change of character of the 
Hata administration mean specifically? 
  [Murayama] In addition to the remarks of former Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano, a succession of remarks by the foreign 
minister and the chief cabinet secretary about the right of 
collective self-defense and a national emergency law is symbolic 
of the fact that the Hata administration as a whole is 
undergoing a change of character, whatever the prime minister 
may say. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Then, you have no intention of rejoining the 
coalition government? 
  [Murayama] The answer is no. If we rejoin the coalition 
government now, it looks as if we have a lingering desire for 
ministerial posts. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is the SDPJ's next administrative 
strategy? 
  [Murayama] We aim at forming a nucleus that can assume the 
helm of state affairs by marshalling forces known as social 
democratic liberals. We are ready to cooperate with forces that 
have a democratic government in mind. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of the SDPJ 
reconsidering its platform and policy? 
  [Murayama] We must transform ourselves so that we can cope 
with the changing times. However, we do not need to change our 
doctrine or judgment formed on the basis of the spirit 
underlying the SDPJ's creation to form a coalition government. 
What a coalition government must do is agree on concrete 
policies for the time being through mutual concessions. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Can you join forces with the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]? 
  [Murayama] Joining forces with the LDP does not lead to a 
change of politics. The Japanese people are expecting a change 
in politics. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your view on North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear arms? 
  [Murayama] One-sided propaganda is much in vogue: Japan has 
no alternative but to cooperate with the United Nations when 
negotiations fail to solve the nuclear issue and when the United 
Nations decides on sanctions against North Korea. There are 
means for further negotiations and it is natural that we should 
search for those means. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How about tax reform? 
  [Murayama] In an aging society, we will face the problem of 
how and who will bear the expenses for pensions, medical care, 
nursing, and welfare. It is impossible to cover the increase of 
burdens by income taxes alone. We have to pay attention to 
assets and consumption to make the sharing of burdens just and 
fair. We will have to discuss the best form of indirect taxes. 
We will watch the moves of the tax reform council of the ruling 
parties and draw our own conclusion.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa announced Tuesday that Japan and the United States have 
agreed to resume "framework" trade talks stalled since February. 
  Kakizawa said the two contries have struck a deal on three 
points to pave the way for reopening the bilateral negotiations 
on the "priority" industry issues -- Japanese Government 
procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, autos 
and auto parts, and insurance business. 
  Among the three points agreed by the two countries is the 
nature of "objective criteria," demanded by the U.S. for 
measuring the openness of Japanese markets, Kakizawa said. 
  Kakizawa said Tokyo and Washington have agreed not to use 
numerical targets as "objective criteria" when assessing foreign 
penetration into the Japanese markets. He also said he is 
convinced that Washington will not resort to punitive measures 
in dealing with trade problems with Japan. 
  The agreement came after on-and-off talks since Thursday 
between Sozaburo Okamatsu, Japanese vice international trade and 
industry minister for international affairs and Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sadayuki Hayashi for economic affairs, representing 
Japan, and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky 
and Bowmen Cutter, deputy director of the White House National 
Economic Council, representing the U.S. 
  Based on the so-called "framework" accord reached last July 
between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, the two countries launched a set of 
formal market-opening negotiations. 
  The talks, however, collapsed in February at a Washington 
meeting between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa mainly due to a U.S. demand for specifying 
"objective criteria." Japan has been opposed to the demand, 
saying such measures would lead to "managed trade" and fearing 
Washington would resort to sanctions if such targets are not met. 
  Under the framework accord, Japan is committed to 
significantly reducing its huge trade surplus by expanding 
domestic demand and opening its markets wider to foreign goods 
and services.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japan is convinced that the 
United States will not resort to punitive actions in dealing 
with bilateral trade problems now that it has dropped demands 
for the use of numerical targets in assessing foreign access to 
Japanese markets, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Tuesday 
[24 May] night. 
  Kakizawa told a press conference that Japan and the U.S. 
basically agreed to resume the stalled trade framework talks and 
not to use numerical targets as "objective criteria" for 
measuring foreign market access. 
  "Both sides also agreed to introduce `qualitative and 
quantitative' criteria (to measure the progress of imports in 
penetrating Japanese markets) and not to use a single criterion 
to judge (the openness of Japan's markets), so we're convinced 
that sanctions will not be implemented," Kakizawa said. 
  The trade talks collapsed in February because of differences 
over the definition of "objective criteria." Tokyo rejected 
U.S. demands for what Japanese officials criticized as 
"numerical targets" for specifying market shares of U.S. 
products in the Japanese market. 
  Kakizawa said Tuesday's accord on resumption of the 
framework 
talks brought Tokyo and Washington to the "starting line, not 
the goal." 
  The schedules for negotiations over specific areas are to be 
worked out in later consultations with the U.S., Kakizawa said, 
adding he hopes negotiations for each working group will be 
carried out simultaneously. 
  Japan will compile a second package of market-opening 
measures by the end of June or early July. 
  Kakizawa said he will study whether or not to visit the U.S. 
when Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi returns to Japan, 
taking into account Diet schedules. 
  Kakizawa also told reporters he held talks with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor on the phone prior to the news 
conference. 
  In the talks, the two sides agreed to maintain close contact 
in the course of the resumed framework negotiations, Kakizawa 
said. 
  They agreed that it was good for both sides that they were 
able to reach agreement on resuming the talks and were able to 
deepen mutual understandings and create common understanding, he 
said. 
  He said Japan and the U.S. were able to reach the accord to 
resume the talks because both sides took a "realistic approach" 
by putting an end to "theological" discussions. 
  Both Tokyo and Washington were also concerned that the 
unstable economic relations between the two nations would have a 
negative influence on overall bilateral relations, he said.

<F P=106> ["FM Spokesman Calls for Measure for Total Elimination of </F>
Nukes"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry issued a statement today regarding the fact 
that at the recent UN Disarmament Commission meeting a sharp 
conflict of views surfaced between the developing countries and 
the Western countries as to whether emphasis should be placed on 
the elimination of nuclear weapons or on the strengthening of 
the nuclear nonproliferation system with regard to the question 
of nuclear disarmament. 
  He said: 
  Many developing countries including our country strongly 
urged that the international community should take it as their 
first and foremost goal to comprehensively and totally eliminate 
the existing nuclear weapons within a certain period through 
universal and non- discriminatory multilateral negotiations and 
treaty and that the nuclear weapon states should carry out 
nuclear disarmament. 
  By contrast, the United States and other Western countries 
persisted in their old position that emphasis should be placed 
on the strengthening of the nuclear nonproliferation system in 
the present stage and, to this end, the role of the UN Security 
Council should be enhanced. 
  The "guideline" and "recommendations" on nuclear disarmament 
worked out and submitted by the Western countries, focussing on 
the nuclear nonproliferation issue, could not be passed due to 
the opposition of the developing countries. 
  The position taken by the developing countries at the 
meeting 
was a very justifiable one conforming to the aspirations of the 
world people to see our planet free from nuclear weapons and 
live in peace. 
  The process of the meeting made it all the clearer that 
there 
is no change in the ambition of the United States and other 
Western countries to maintain their nuclear monopoly and turn 
the world round its finger. 
  With the Cold War having come to an end, the existence of 
nuclear weapons cannot be justified on any account. Therefore, 
a significant measure for the total abolition of the existing 
nuclear weapons must be taken and the discriminative nature of 
the nonproliferation treaty be removed. 
  The United States and other Western countries, however, 
resort to trite threat and pressure against the non-nuclear 
states including the DPRK under an unreasonable pretext while 
failing to do what they must do. 
  While raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "nuclear 
suspicion" against the DPRK, they pretend to be ignorant of the 
real threat of nuclear armament such as the recently discovered 
concealment of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan. 
  This can be said to be the culmination of the application of 
a double standard. 
  The problem will not be solved any time, if the United 
States 
and other Western countries continue to apply the double 
standard in the nuclear issue, refusing to accept the just 
demand of the developing countries for the total abolition of 
nuclear weapons and the removal of the discriminative nature of 
the NPT at a time when the extension of the validity of the NPT 
is being discussed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- May 23 marks the 55th 
anniversary of the victory in the historic operation of advance 
into Musan area. 
  The operation organized and commanded by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song in May, 1939, was one of the operations of 
advance into the homeland which recorded a shining page in the 
history of the Korean people's anti-Japanese revolutionary war. 
  The late 1930s was the darkest period in the Japanese 
imperialist rule (1905-1945) over Korea. In those days the 
Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale "punitive" 
offensive with the mobilization of forces hundreds of thousands 
strong, calling the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) "a 
cancer" in the fulfilment of their plan of aggression on the 
continent. 
  They also destroyed grass-roots organizations of the 
association for the restoration of the fatherland and other 
revolutionary organizations and arrested and killed many people 
at random. 
  The Korean revolution faced a temporary difficulty. 
  President Kim Il-song worked out a plan to advance a large 
unit into the homeland with a view to actively breaking through 
it and leading the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle to 
a high tide. 
  A large-scale spring counteroffensive was waged in late 
April 
and early May for the preparation of advance into the homeland. 
  The main unit of the KPRA attacked Qiujiadian, Shiwudaogou, 
Banjiegou and other strategic vantages of the enemy along the 
River Amnok one after another, winning a great victory. 
  The historic operation of advance into the homeland was 
started on May 18. 
  President Kim Il-song, who marched into the homeland across 
the River Amnok, leading the main unit of the KPRA, reached Mupo 
on May 21 via Chongbong, Konchang, Pegaebong and Lake Samji. 
  He called a meeting of KPRA commanding officers at the camp 
in Mupo and issued an order to advance to the Musan area. 
  On the 22nd, the main unit of the KPRA liberated the 
extensive area of Mt. Noun around Sinsadong and Singaechok. 
  Reaching the Sinsadong area, leading the eighth regiment and 
the guards company of the command, President Kim Il-song made a 
historical speech "let us rise up vigorously in the 
anti-Japanese struggle to hasten the liberation of the homeland" 
before Sinsadong people. 
  That day, the KPRA completely wiped out the pursuing enemy 
on 
trucks. 
  The battle on the Taehongdan plain, the climax of the 
operation, took place on the 23rd. The Japanese imperialists 
sent a huge force to the Musan area in an attempt to check the 
advance of the KPRA into the homeland. 
  President Kim Il-song unfolded an operation to annihilate 
the 
enemy on the plain and brought the battle to a victory with 
superb guerrilla tactics. 
  Hundreds of the Japanese imperialist aggression troops were 
killed or wounded in the battle. 
  The operation of advance into the Musan area ended in a 
great 
political and military victory of the KPRA. 
  It fully demonstrated the outstanding commanding art of 
President Kim Il-song and the invincible might of the KPRA and 
brought about a constant upsurge in the Korean revolution as a 
whole with the anti- Japanese armed struggle in its center.

  [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to Seoul 
James Laney flatly denied Wednesday reports that Washington 
pressed Seoul to buy Patriot Missiles. 
  He said the Patriots were brought here by the United States 
for its own deterrence purposes as to send the message to 
Pyongyang that the South's defenses are strong in a speech at 
the Press Center sponsored by the Parliamentarians' Society of 
Korea. 
  He also brushed aside reports that the United States was 
exaggerating the situation on the Korean peninsula, saying 
Washington was neither cooking nor imagining threat from North 
Korea. 
  He cited reports by the safeguards team of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), now in Pyongyang for additional 
nuclear inspections, that no spent fuel has been diverted since 
1989 based on camera surveillance. 
  "This means there was no diversion since 1989," he said. 
  Laney, however, quoted U.S. intelligence which states that 
diversion might have occurred during the discharge of fuel rods 
in 1989. 
  He said the U.N. nuclear watchdog is now working to clarify 
the history of the process before 1989 by taking samples. 
  Laney reiterated that North Korea must satisfy not only 
South 
Korea and the United States, but the whole world that it is not 
pursuing a nuclear program. 
  "With this assurance (that Pyongyang has given up its 
nuclear 
ambitions), we will be prepared, in full consultation with South 
Korea, to begin the process of normalizing both diplomatic and 
economic ties with North Korea," he said. 
  "North Korea must open up to the point for their interests, 
not for U.S. interests," he said. 
  To reduce tension, he said, "they (North Koreans) have to 
make a move." "We (the United States) have our doors open...It 
is not us isolating North Korea. North Korea has isolated 
itself," he said.

  [Text] Hiroshima, May 24 KYODO -- Government officials and 
disarmament experts from some 20 countries, mainly in the 
Asia-Pacific region, opened a four-day United Nations conference 
on disarmament Tuesday [24 May]. 
  But North Korea, branded as the major security risk in the 
region because of its alleged nuclear weapons program, did not 
send a delegation to the annual gathering for the second year in 
a row. 
  China, Pyongyang's close ally, canceled its participation at 
short notice, citing the date of the conference as inconvenient. 
  While the organizer, the U.N. Center on Disarmament Affairs, 
was eager to stress that China's absence "has no political 
meaning," the prevailing opinion at the conference is that the 
cancellation is due to the controversy over the nuclear issue. 
  Welcoming the 62 participants, Yoneo Hirata, parliamentary 
vice foreign minister, pledged that Japan will not aim at 
becoming a military power. 
  "We reconfirm our basic policy not to turn into a military 
power, but to develop an active policy of contributing to 
disarmament," Hirata said. 
  He called on North Korea to dispel suspicion that it plans 
to 
build nuclear weapons by fully accepting international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  Speaking at the first plenary session on "disarmament 
through 
regional dialogue," Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
President Yohei Kono proposed that all nuclear powers discuss 
nuclear disarmament at a special conference in Hiroshima next 
year. 
  Kono urged the atomic powers to show their devotion to 
nuclear disarmament by concluding a comprehensive ban on nuclear 
tests by August next year, which marks the 50th anniversary of 
both the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only 
cities in the world to have sustained a nuclear attack, and the 
establishment of the United Nations. 
  Discussions at the conference are expected to focus on the 
promotion of security in the Asia-Pacific region and on the 
extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which 
comes up for renewal in 1995. 
  In the past, the 1968 international treaty, which aims at 
curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and fissionable material 
to nonnuclear countries, has been extended for five-year periods. 
  The nuclear powers, first of all the United States, have 
proposed to extend the NPT indefinitely, an approach opposed by 
many nonnuclear states on the grounds that such a move would 
perpetuate the nuclear "club" of Britain, China, France, Russia 
and the U.S. 
  After the end of the official part of the conference Friday, 
the participants, including New Zealand's minister for 
disarmament and arms control, Douglas Graham, and Russia's Ednan 
Agayev, director of analysis forecasting at the Foreign 
Ministry, are scheduled to meet with A-bomb survivors at a 
public symposium. 
  Earlier in the day, the disarmament experts visited the 
Peace 
Memorial Museum and prayed at the memorial cenotaph for victims 
of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. 
  Similar meetings have been held every year in Japan since 
Kyoto hosted the first session in 1989. This year's conference 
is the sixth of its kind.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak 
reported the outcome of the recent meeting of a group of 14 
agricultural products exporting countries, or Cairns Group, in 
Uruguay. He noted that several conclusions were made especially 
on a push to lessen protectionism and subsidies for agricultural 
goods in the world market. 
  On the occasion, the deputy prime minister said that 
Thailand 
proposed that the Cairns group include fishery products in its 
list of agricultural goods so that the group could together push 
developed countries to minimize their trade protectionism 
against fishery products from other countries. Their objective 
is especially focused on the United States, which often sets 
conditions for imported fishery products from other countries. 
  Moreover, Suphachai noted that the proposal will be greatly 
beneficial to Thailand. This is because fishery goods make up 
half of the total value of all Thai agricultural products. This 
proposal gained support from Australia, New Zealand, and 
Argentina. Nevertheless, Chile was still reluctant to follow 
suit for fear that the developed countries would use the 
proposal as a bargaining tool to open up marine resources as 
well.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 24 -- Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad received in Kuala Lumpur yesterday Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet who is on an unofficial visit to Malaysia 
and attended the forum of the leaders of the Pacific Basin 
Economic Council (PBEC) there. 
  P.M. Mohamad and P.M. Kiet expressed their full 
satisfactiona 
at the fine development of the friendship and multi-faceted 
cooperation between the two countries. They also exchanged 
views on concrete measures with a view to expand the 
Vietnam-Malaysia cooperation in the fields of industry, 
manufacture, building materials, tourism and industrial zone 
construction. 
  On the situation in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the two 
prime ministers expressed their pleasure at the development of 
the trend for peace and cooperation. They stressed that 
regional countries should do their utmost to contribute to the 
consolidation of such trend, through negotiation to settle any

  P.M. Mohamad reaffirmed that Malaysia fully supported for 
Vietnam in its preparation to joint in ASEAN as a full member.

  [Text] Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and his 
Vietnamese counterpart, Mr. Vo Van Kiet, have held an official 
talk in Malaysia. Vietnam prime minister was in Kuala Lumpur to 
attend the 27th International General Conference of the Pacific 
Basin Economic Council. The Voice of Vietnam summarizes the 
talks between the two prime ministers: 
  Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Kiet discussed bilateral multilateral 
relations and international issues of common concern. They 
expressed their satisfaction at the positive developments in the 
friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two 
countries in the last two years. During this time, the two 
countries have repeatedly exchanged visits of high-level 
delegations. In January 1992, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
visited Malaysia and in April of the same year, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir officially visited Vietnam. In March 1994, 
Vietnamese Party General Secretary Do Muoi also visited 
Malaysia. The visits have all helped broaden mutual 
understanding, consolidate mutual trust, and promote mutual 
comprehensive cooperation. 
  At present, Malaysia is among six ASEAN countries who have a 
large investment in Vietnam worth about $75 million. Two-way 
trade turnover between the two countries at present is 20 times 
larger than 1985 figure of $20 million. During the talks this 
time in Kuala Lumpur, the two prime ministers discussed concrete 
measures to strengthen cooperation in the production of 
construction materials, industrial construction, and tourism. 
  Concerning the situation in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, 
the two prime ministers expressed their satisfaction at the 
increasing trend for peace and cooperation in the region and 
stated: Nations in the region must join their efforts for 
consolidation of this trend, through which all disputes should 
be solved in the principle of mutual respect and respect for 
internatonal law and practices. 
  Prime Minister Mahathir once again affirmed the support for 
Vietnam's admission to ASEAN as a full member which will benefit 
both Vietnam and Malaysia and cooperation for prosperity in the 
region.

  [Text] Australia will spend 32 million Australian dollars 
[A$] over four years to develop telecommunications and 
environmental protection in ASEAN countries. 
  The spending, or eight million dollars a year, is part of 
the 
ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program and will be 
channelled through the Australia International Development 
Assistant Bureau (AIDAB). 
  Australia has outlined six projects for development in 
ASEAN: 
  -- Coastal Zone Development and Resource Management. 
  -- Waste Water Treatment Technology Transfer and Cleaners 
Production Demonstration. 
  -- Environmentally-sound Energy Production and Waste 
Disposal from Biomass/Waste Supplemented by Fossil Fuels. 
  -- ASEAN-Australia Forum Telecommunication Cooperation in 
Training which may be implemented with Information and 
Communication Technology for Sustainable Development. 
  -- Electricity and the Environment: A Framework for 
Decision Making in the ASEAN Region. 
  -- Development of Food Safety and Quality Assurance 
Systems for Marketing and Distribution of Fresh and Processed 
Horticultural Products in ASEAN. 
  AIDAB's Regional Programme Officer in Bangkok, Julie Angela 
Kaeowaen, said the projects are part of phase three of the 
cooperation program. Phase one was conducted during 1984-89 and 
phase two during 1989-94. 
  In each project, four consultants from Australia and ASEAN 
will visit every ASEAN member to conduct a feasibility study and 
come up with an implementation plan that suits the development 
of that particular project. 
  The feasibility study has been conducted already for the 
coastal zone environment and waste water projects, and the 
consultant team arrives in Bangkok today to do the 
environmentally-sound energy production project. 
  The team to deal with the telecommunications project is 
expected to be here in late July. Eighteen participants from 
six ASEAN members will participate in each course under the 
project, which will include a training course in Australia that 
varies from ten days to ten weeks depending on the course. 
  Miss Kaeowaen said 25 courses will be conducted under the 
telecommunication project, three courses will concentrate on 
policy and regulations, eight courses on economics and 
management and the rest on technology. 
  The participants will include academics, company executives 
and government officials, who will be selected by the Thai 
Foreign Ministry. 
  Australia also launched a project under the Linkages Stream 
for one year, granting A$25,000-250,000 to applicants who seek 
funds to support a technical and investment feasibility study 
aimed at encouraging investment exchanges between ASEAN and 
Australia, mutually beneficial trade, investment promotion and 
related projects. 
  Thailand has had the most response to this project, with 260 
applications for the funds.

  [Excerpts] An Indonesian delegation comprising Mr. 
Hartarto, coordinating minister of industrial and trade affairs, 
and wife; Dr. Haryanto Danudirto, minister of communications; 
Mr. Joop Ave, minister of tourism, posts, and 
telecommunications; senior departmental officials; and 
entrepreneurs arrived in Yangon [Rangoon] by special aircraft at 
1130 for a goodwill visit at the invitation of the Government of 
the Union of Myanmar [Burma]. [passage omitted on welcoming 
ceremony] 
  Mr. Hartarto, Dr. Haryanto Danudirto, Mr. Joop Ave, and 
entourage then called on Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, 
secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
[SLORC], at the Padauk Hall of the People's Park Restaurant at 
1830. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and wife Daw Khin Win Shwe later 
hosted a dinner in honor of the Indonesian guests. The dinner 
was attended by Vice Admiral Maung Maung Khin, and Lt. Gen. Tin 
Tun, deputy prime ministers; Lt. Gen. Tin U, SLORC secretary-2; 
SLORC members and wives; cabinet ministers and wives; deputy 
ministers; and department heads. At the reception, Lt. Gen. 
Khin Nyunt and Mr. Hartarto exchanged toasts. Afterwards, the 
visitors were entertained with cultural dances at the Theatrical 
Hall. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. Haryanto Danudirto called on Lt. Gen. Thein 
Win, minister of transport, at his office at 1530. They held 
cordial and frank talks on bilateral air traffic matters, 
development of ports, training programs, and bilateral 
cooperation. Furthermore, Mr. Joop Ave, called on Lt. Gen. Kyaw 
Ba, minister of hotels and tourism, at his office at 1530. At 
the meeting, Mr. Joop Ave explained that Myanmar and Indonesia 
have been good friends and the friendship will never be 
forgotten. He said both countries value independence and the 
friendship with Myanmar will always be remembered since both 
countries previously struggled to gain independence. He noted 
that at one point Indonesia received help when it was in need, 
so now Indonesia would like to help Myanmar in its time of need. 
He noted that Indonesia would like to help and cooperate in the 
development of Myanmar's hotels and tourism services. He 
explained that Indonesia is ready to assist in the training of 
Myanmar hotel personnel and that hoteliers accompanying him 
could give more assistance. He said Indonesia is ready to train 
about 50 Myanmar hotel personnel and explained that one 
conviction in Indonesia is to develop the country in a modern 
way, but not in the Western style. He said Myanmar hotel and 
tourism services should be developed according to Myanmar 
culture and tradition. He suggested that local Myanmar products 
should be used in hotel construction, Myanmar cuisine should be 
promoted, and traditional Myanmar entertainment should be 
offered. He said emphasis should also be placed on promoting 
and expressing Indonesia's willingness to cooperate. 
  Lt. Gen. Kyaw Ba thanked the Indonesian minister for the 
suggestions and invited him for further visits.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with General Saw Bo Mya, chairman of </F>
the National Council and Karen National Union, by an 
unidentified correspondent -- place, date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] I would like to ask about the 
cease-fire agreement with the SLORC [State Law and Order 
Restoration Council]. General Mya, what would you like to say 
about this? 
  [Mya] Our view is that we will not be able to achieve 
internal peace through a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC. 
The SLORC's cease-fire is a sham. The revolutionary forces in 
Burma took up arms for political reasons; the SLORC is pursuing 
a cease-fire, but this does not solve the political problem. 
Internal peace can only be established when the political and 
ethnic problems are solved. The SLORC is not doing this. It is 
pursuing a cease-fire, but it is not talking about politics. 
When political issues are raised, it insists categorically on 
the surrender of arms. The KNU [Karen National Union] cannot 
accept this. 
  Other ethnic groups made cease-fire agreements with the 
SLORC 
and held talks, but they were not allowed to raise political 
questions; they stopped at the cease-fire issue. This does not 
serve the interests of the ethnic groups' armed revolutionary 
struggle. Furthermore, the SLORC does not wish to establish 
internal peace; we have learned that it is pursuing this in 
order to get foreign loans. 
  [Correspondent] The news on the outside is that the SLORC 
and 
Gen. Mya's KNU are attempting to hold cease-fire talks. 
Considering the points you just mentioned, what reason would 
you have for holding cease-fire talks? 
  [Mya] We will not discuss a cease-fire with the SLORC. We 
will participate, however, if talks are held. If we participate 
we will do so according to DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] 
policy; if we hold talks we will do so as the entire DAB. We 
informed the SLORC, but it did not accept this. It said it will 
only hold separate talks. We said we would hold separate talks, 
but they had to be held abroad in accordance with DAB policy. 
The SLORC did not accept this; it wanted to hold the talks in 
Rangoon. 
  We insisted on holding talks abroad because we held talks 
with the BSPP [Burma Socialist Program Party] on three previous 
occasions without any success. On these previous occasions, 
they said the political problem had to be solved politically and 
insisted on surrender. Now the SLORC is doing the same. We 
insisted on holding talks abroad because it insisted on 
surrender without attempt to solve political problems by 
political means. We want to hold talks abroad because we want 
to establish genuine internal peace and discuss matters freely 
as we wish. We want to work in a cordial manner in an attempt 
to bring about internal peace. It is neither our desire nor 
wish to obtain a cease-fire; we are striving for lasting peace. 
The SLORC, however, does not accept this. 
  [Correspondent] I gather from what you just said that you 
wish to hold talks with the SLORC not only on the limited matter 
of a cease-fire, but on broad issues including political and 
military matters and the issue of peace in the country. Is this 
assessment correct? 
  [Mya] Yes. We want peace for the entire country and not just 
peace between the Burmese and Karen. We want peace in the whole 
of Burma. 
  [Correspondent] You said the SLORC rejected your suggestion. 
According to one report we received, the SLORC verbally rejected 
your proposal to hold talks in Thailand. Is this correct? 
  [Mya] That is correct. I met the military attache, but they 
also did not accept this. 
  [Correspondent] There is a report that Khun Sa had proposed 
an alliance with various ethnic groups, including the KNU. Is 
this true? 
  [Mya] There was an offer from Khun Sa. Khun Sa had publicly 
declared the formation of a republic. We sent some youths to 
observe his declaration of a republic. We wanted to study the 
extent of the Shan people's support and interest. 
  [Correspondent] The SLORC has alleged that representatives 
of 
the KNU, Mon, and Karenni met with Khun Sa to discuss a military 
union. Would you like to comment on this? 
  [Mya] This is not true. It was not aimed at military union. 
We wanted to observe whether they would fight after achieving 
independence. As far as we observed, they will not fight the 
SLORC, but will retaliate if the SLORC attacks them. That is 
what we observed. 
  [Correspondent] That is all I would like to ask on the 
current situation. Would you like to add anything, Gen. Bo Mya? 
  [Mya] The people of Burma are being oppressed and insulted 
by 
the SLORC. Other countries should consider this; they should 
remember the suffering and hardship of the people of Burma and 
come to our defense. 
  [Correspondent] I said I had no more questions, but I do 
have 
another question. Does the DAB remain as united as before? 
  [Mya] Yes. The DAB remains united, and there is much 
understanding. Some organizations that already held talks with 
the SLORC have become disappointed because the SLORC does as it 
pleases, while some organizations are reestablishing contact 
with us. 
  [Correspondent] The fourth anniversary of the general 
elections in 27 May. What would you like to say in this regard? 
  [Mya] The people want genuine internal peace and full 
democratic rights. They absolutely do not want the SLORC. The 
people's judgment will eventually prevail.

<F P=106> [Station editorial: "The Enemies of the Nation and People </F>
Are Vigorously Continuing Activities To Oppose National 
Reconciliation and Peace in Cambodia"] 
  [Text] The roundtable meeting to be held in Pyongyang on 27 
May constitutes a major event for our nation and people. The 
Cambodian people, who are victims of the 15 year Vietnamese war 
of aggression, yearn for national reconciliation and peace so 
they can live again in peace. As before, however, the enemies 
of our nation and people do not want us to unite and have peace. 
They intend further to fan the flames of war in order to 
massacre the people, which will permit them to have the 
opportunity to grab the interests of our nation and people at 
will. 
  Look, while His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk is striving to 
convene a roundtable meeting, the communist Vietnamese puppets 
are actively seeking foreign arms aid -- the puppet Sar Kheng's 
recent visit to the United States is conspicuous evidence, and 
so on. Moreover, Winston Lord, U.S. assistant secretary of 
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, recently disclosed 
that he was currently holding talks with France, Australia, and 
others about the possibility of sending armaments for the 
two-headed government further to attack Democratic Kampuchea. 
  The above activities and utterances are evidence that the 
communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance never want 
us, the Cambodians, to unite and to live peacefully. They will 
continue to inflame war with a view to doing away with our 
nation and killing our people. Should the Pyongyang roundtable 
meeting fail, it will be due to the continuing opposition by the 
communist Vietnamese and their puppets and alliance to the 
national reconciliation plan of the king. 
  All in all, the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and 
alliance can never act unchecked. The trend of peace and 
national reconciliation against war is becoming more and more 
zealous with each passing day. This tendency is immensely 
forceful and absolutely unstoppable. Those opposing national 
reconciliation and peace by further inflaming war are all 
traitors of the nation and people. One day, they will, at all 
costs, be crushed to pieces by the trend of national 
reconciliation and peace among the nation and people. National 
reconciliation, peace, independence, and Cambodia's genuine 
national unity then will be restored.

  [Text] A National Defense Ministry delegation of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia headed by His Excellency [H.E.] General Tie 
Banh and H.E. Gen. Tea Chamrat, co-ministers of national 
defense, visited Malaysia from 15 to 20 May. 
  Upon arrival at Subang International Airport, the delegation 
was cordially welcomed by Brigadier General Ismail and several 
other high-ranking Malaysian Defense Ministry officials. 
  On 16 May the delegation had an audience with H.E. Abdul 
Razak, Malaysian minister of national defense, and several other 
military officers. During the audience, H.E. Abdul Razak talked 
about bilateral relations and noted that Malaysian forces took 
part in Cambodia's peace process through the Paris peace 
agreement. He also stated clearly that Cambodia should live in 
peace among all other Southeast Asian countries. Concerning 
investment, he said that Malaysian investors are interested in 
seeing Cambodia achieve economic development. 
  On that occasion, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh briefed the Malaysian 
defense minister on the military situation in western Cambodia. 
He stressed that although the government has to confront the 
Khmer Rouge, economic rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts 
are continuing all over the kingdom. 
  On 17 May the delegation was received by Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed, prime minister of Malaysia. 
  During the meeting, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh informed Mahathir of 
the political, economic, security, and social situation in 
Cambodia and Cambodia's rehabilitation and development since the 
establishment of the legal administration. 
  The delegation also visited the shipyard at Johore Port in 
southern Malaysia and the Proton automobile plant in Kuala 
Lumpur. The delegation also visited the Sapura telephone 
factory, which produces telephones for local consumers and for 
export. 
  On 19 May the delegation visited the FELDA [Federal Land 
Development Authority] development zone, a vast area of 871,600

percent with rubber, and the rest with coffee. 
  The delegation returned home on 20 May.

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Cambodia's Finance Minister Sam 
Rangsi says he may be sacked but will never resign from his 
cabinet post. 
  Rangsi confirmed on Tuesday that he would not quit Cabinet, 
but was not sure if he would be forced into it. 
  "I may be dismissed. But that is another problem, anything 
can happen. The decision to fire me does no depend on me. So I 
cannot forecast," the minister told THE NATION. 
  Rangsi, known for his outspoken views and hard work, was 
responding to a report that he would resign as the finance 
minister. It is said he is unable to implement economic 
development policies due to lack of support from other officials 
who adhere to outdated rules and work methods, and resist 
change. Reports suggested that the Cambodian cabinet would be 
reshuffled soon after government leaders complete scheduled 
peace talks with the Khmer Rouge starting in North Korea 
tomorrow. 
  The ministers likely to be affected by the reshuffle are 
Ministers of Defence Gen. Tie Banh and Gen. Tea Chamrat, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Norodom Sirivut and Rangsi, 
both from the Funcinpec Party. 
  Prince Sirivut has been close to Rangsi, who is involved in 
a 
running dispute with a firm, named as the Thai Bunrung Company, 
which is run by a Teng Bunma. The company's owner is said to be 
very close to the First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
leader of the Funcinpec Party. 
  Rangsi, however, says he has a growing number of supporters 
for his work. He said he kept telling his colleagues and 
officials to not only do good when going to a temple, but also 
to do good deeds at the office, to serve the people and the poor. 
  "I am very faithful to my direct boss, Prince Ranariddh. And 
I won't change parties. I can be very efficient in my party so 
there's no need to find another party or look for another 
president of the Funcinpec. I would like to help my boss 
strengthen the party," he said. 
  "I am satisfied with my performance as a whole. I would like 
to move faster, but there are many difficulties and constraints, 
which force me to move slowly. My economic reform has threatened 
the personal interests of many and they are powerful. Such 
people do not want to give up their position," he said. 
  He added that he supports King Norodom Sihanouk's proposal 
to 
amend the constitution so that the Khmer Rouge can join the 
government. The constitution currently stipulates that 
government posts must be given to elected members of the 
National Assembly. 
  Rangsi said he would be happy to have the Khmer Rouge as his 
colleagues in the Finance Ministry instead of seeing them in the 
jungle. "I expect positive signs from the roundtable talks 
scheduled for May 27," he said.

  [Text] Opposition lawmakers on the House committee 
monitoring MPs' conduct yesterday accused the United States 
Information Service (USIS) of acting in collusion with the Thai 
Foreign Ministry to smear the name of Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon 
Chongsutthanamani. According to USIS, the US Embassy in Bangkok 
on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's application for a US entry visa 
on the grounds that he was suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking by US law enforcement authorities. 
  "Everybody on the House committee on parliamentary affairs 
agreed that USIS was apparently in great haste and gave 
confusing statements regarding the rejection of Mongkhon's visa 
application," said MP Phairot Suwanchawi (Chat Phatthana-Nakhon 
Ratchasima). 
  Phairot, a member of the House committee, claimed that the 
US 
Embassy informed Mongkhon that it could not issue an entry visa 
to him because he had not submitted all necessary documentation 
on February 28. 
  "The USIS statement said the US Embassy rejected his visa 
application on March 18. How can the embassy reject the visa 
application on March 18 when Mongkhon did not re-submit his 
application at that time?" the Chat Phatthana MP said. 
  There apparently was a misunderstanding on the part of 
opposition lawmakers as a copy of a notification dated Feb 28 
issued by the US Embassy informed Mongkhon that he was 
ineligible at that time for the entry visa because his 
application was still "pending necessary administrative 
processing". Therefore, it appears no irregularities were 
involved when, after consulting the US law enforcement 
authorities, the embassy on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's visa 
application on the grounds of suspected drug trafficking 
activities. Copies of the US Embassy notification, written in 
English, were given to reporters yesterday by some members of 
the House committee. 
  Phairot said the House committee also decided that the 
government should devise measures to prevent people from 
accusing others of serious crimes without supplying evidence to 
back up the charges. He also said Mongkhon, who testified 
before the House committee without being summoned, announced 
that he was willing to travel to the United States if the US 
Embassy here arranged for his journey. 
  "Khun Mongkhon said he was prepared to go to the United 
States even if he would be arrested by US authorities upon 
arrival," Phairot said. 
  MP Witthaya Thianthong (Chat Thai-Sa Kaeo), also a member of 
the House committee, said USIS must have colluded with the 
Foreign Ministry to damage Mongkhon's reputation. 
  "USIS must have been given a cue from the Foreign Ministry. 
The whole thing is politics between the coalition government 
and the opposition," Witthaya said. He acknowledged that some 
coalition government MPs on the House committee did not agree 
with the opposition lawmakers' theory. 
  The House committee chairman, Charoen Khanthawong 
(Democrat-Bangkok), said the House committee did not make any 
decision as to what to do with Mongkhon's case. Charoen said 
opposition MPs on the panel claimed there were irregularities in 
the way USIS handled Mongkhon's case but several other members 
disagreed. 
  "Some members claimed that USIS was interfering in Thai 
politics, while others disagreed," the chairman said. 
  Charoen said the House committee had sought more information 
regarding Mongkhon's case from the US Embassy but was told that 
any request must go through the Foreign Ministry. 
  The House committee has yet to conclude its investigation 
into the case of former MP Thanong Siriprichaphong (Chat 
Thai-Nakhon Phanom), who resigned from the Chat Thai Party last 
Saturday and who subsequently lost his House membership. 
  Thanong has been charged in the United States with smuggling 
into that country more than 45 metric tons of marijuana between 
1973- 1987. Thanong's assets in the United States -- a Beverly 
Hills house and a Mercedes Benz -- have been seized under a US 
court order.

<F P=106> [From the "Political Monitor" column: "Secret Service </F>
Connection"] 
  [Text] CIA please lend an ear. It has now been revealed 
how Democrat MP Somkhit Nuanphian knew so much about a 
proclaimed U.S. blacklist of Thai politicians suspected of 
involvement in the drug trade. 
  "He told me he got that information when he worked for the 
KGB," said Democrat Thanin Chaisamut, referring to the Central 
Intelligence Agency's rival in the former Soviet empire. Thanin 
appeared serious. 
  Asked if Somkhit remained a Soviet spy, Thanin replied, "Not 
any more. The Soviet Union has crumbled." 
  Somkhit triggered the Opposition's outburst when he followed 
up on Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's statement that many 
Thai politicians were blacklisted due to suspicion that they 
were involved in narcotics smuggling. During a tumultuous House 
debate, opposition MPs demanded Somkhit, who was not in the 
chamber, to reveal names and disclose the source of his 
information. Thanin said he tried to avoid Somkhit. 
  "I don't walk with him any longer. There's nothing except 
that I'm afraid I'll be caught in the cross-fire if somebody 
tries to silence him," Thanin said.

  [Text] Up to 50,000 Burmese have fled to Thailand to 
escape the current offensive by the Burmese Army against the 
forces of drug warlord Khun Sa, according to Khachatphai 
Burutphat, deputy secretary-general of the National Security 
Council. Khachatphai said, however, the fighting is not as 
fierce as that by the Burmese government against Karen forces. 
  "I expcct Khun Sa's people escaped to Chiang Mai and Mae 
Hong 
Son Provinces. However, the authorities are prepared to deal 
with the problems that may arise", he said. 
  Khachatphai also said that Thailand would take care of and 
assist the refugees on humanitarian grounds. But they would be 
sent back to Burma as soon as the situation has improved. He 
added that the authorities are able to ensure security for 
people living in the troubled border area. 
  Asked to comment on whether the U.S. government is to 
provide 
assistance for the Burmese government to battle Khun Sa's 
troops, Khachatphai said the Council had not yet learned if the 
United States would support the Burmese forces. 
  Also, Khachatphai said the fighting is aimed at cracking 
down 
on the production and trafficking of drugs by Khun Sa.

  [Text] Suthichai Yun, editor-in-chief of THE NATION 
Publishing Group, will halt all his political programs on radio 
to underscore the "lack of freedom of expression" on the 
country's radio stations. 
  The decision came after the Army Territorial Defense 
Department "requested" the publishing group to delete all 
political comments from radio FM 96, which was leased to a 
private company, PK Advertising Co. and sub-contracted to the 
Nation Publishing Group to produce news and commentary programs. 
  "Since we can't have the freedom to comment freely on the 
country's political, military and social affairs, we have 
decided to pull out all our commentary programs from the radio 
station," he said, adding that non-political programs will be 
back on the air today, "to keep our communication channel with 
our listeners open and to deliver the vital message that this is 
the best we have to offer the public under the circumstances". 
  Suthichai said he had decided to stop all his radio programs 
-- including his morning and evening political talk shows on FM 
97 owned by the government-run Public Relations Department -- 
"to protest against this government's failure to live up to its 
promise to respect the people's right to information through 
radio". He said radio commentators in Thailand still get 
"thinly-veiled threats" for their frank, critical remarks 
against government agencies and the military. 
  "Radio producers and commentators are often threatened with 
termination of their contracts if they report or comment frankly 
on current affairs. Since government agencies still own and 
control all the 400-odd radio stations, they still consider the 
frequencies their own mouthpieces. Nobody is allowed to 
criticize the government agencies which own those frequencies," 
he said. 
  "This government has not done anything to return radio 
stations to the people. I feel it is time to show how serious 
the problem is. I will not resume my radio commentaries until 
such time that we have the freedom to express our opinions 
frankly, freely and professionally," Suthichai said.

  [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa 
[Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM) expressed 
dissatisfaction over the performance of the government panel 
lead by Prof. Alfredo Tadiar, saying the panel is incapable of 
making important decisions regarding the ongoing talks. 
  In a briefing with BUSINESS WORLD, cashiered Army Lt. Col. 
Gregorio Honasan commented the panel cannot make independent 
moves, particularly on key issues surrounding peace negotiations. 
  Mr. Honasan said the release of alleged communist Secretary 
General Wilma Tiamzon demonstrated the power of the government 
panel tasked to negotiate with the communist National Democratic 
Front (NDF). 
  The group has been asking for the release of six RAM members 
who continue to be detained allegedly due to their participation 
in the series of coups launched against the Aquino 
Administration. 
  Ambassador Howard Dee, government panel chairman tasked to 
negotiate with the NDF, was said to be one of those who 
convinced President Ramos to release Ms. Tiamzon to save the 
peace talks. Mr. Dee told BUSINESS WORLD he is also personally 
arranging for the release of more or less 350 political 
prisoners still detained in Muntinlupa and other parts of the 
country. 
  On the other hand, Mr. Tadiar said the release of the six 
soldiers should be left to "judicial discretion" and that the 
matter should be left to the courts. "Bakit si Wilma Tiamzon 
pinalaya nila? (Why did they release...) We have been asking for 
the release of our comrades since 1992," Mr. Honasan said. 
  Similarly, RAM compared Mr. Tadiar's panel with the 
government panel negotiating with the Moro National Liberation 
Front (MNLF). Last March, Ambassador Manuel Yan, panel chairman, 
allowed MNLF chief Nur Misuari to bring with him 100 heavily 
armed bodyguards around Mindanao. 
  During the barangay [village] election period this month, 
RAM 
said they were not given permits to carry firearms. One RAM 
member said Mr. Tadiar told the group he can only make 
recommendations to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) for 
them to be exempted. Mr. Tadiar told BUSINESS WORLD his panel 
will be answerable to the Comelec if the procedure in applying 
for gun ban exemption permit was not followed. 
  "They allowed Misuari armed bodyguards but they would not 
allow us to bring guns to protect ourselves," they said. 
  As to whether or not the group wants Mr. Tadiar replaced, 
Mr. 
Honasan said "it's not for us to decide." If President Ramos 
thinks Tadiar is good, it is up to him to retain the panel 
chairman," he stated. 
  Still, Navy Captain Felix Turingan said they have been 
consulted on the panel chairman's performance but "we refused to 
comment." 
  Other RAM members who attended the press briefing were 
former 
Army Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan, Army major Abraham Puruganan and 
lawyer Rick Blancaflor.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Emergency Food Aid Relieve Rice </F>
Shortage"] 
  [Text] Over 400,000 people suffer from rice shortage in the 
country after severe drought last September devastated crop 
yields in parts of southern and northern Laos. People who may 
traditionally have to cope with three month or so annual 
shortage face the prospect of no rice at all for six to eleven 
months until the next harvest in October or November. 
  With no other income source than agriculture, they depend on 
the ever diminishing resources of their neighbours or relatives 
and the shrinking number of small animals, rodents, insects and 
tubers hunted and foraged in the forests. Many farmers have 
already been forced by hunger to consume the seeds set aside for 
the 1994 planting. For most families, sale of buffalo -- the 
main source of energy for ploughing -- would represent an act of 
desperation. There have not been widespread livestock sales thus 
far. 
  In 1993, the Lao PDR's [People's Democratic Republic] 
production of rice, the staple food of the country, was 1.25 
million tonnes, some 17 percent below the previous year's 
harvest. The provinces of Savannakhet, Saravane, Sayaboury, and 
Houa Phan were particularly hard hit. In Savannakhet Province, 
normally a premier rice producer, ten of thirteen districts 
produced a deficit. Some districts face, on average, an eleven 
month shortage and some people have had no reliable source of 
food since the last harvest. 
  As the magnitude of the problem became known, the Government 
of Laos acted swiftly to seek assistance from the international 
community through the United Nation's World Food Programme 
(WFP). A joint Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)/WFP 
assessment in February recommended food aid amounting to 43,000 
tonnes of polished rice to supply the people of the worst 
affected districts in the four hardest hit provinces. Those 
enduring the most severe food shortage would each receive 72 kgs 
of rice to tide them over the final six months before the 1994 
harvest. 
  Ms. Ameerah Haq-Perera, United Nations Development Programme 
resident representative, explains that the situation is not 
comparable to a famine of the proportions experienced in 
Ethiopia or Somalia: "The effects are not of people starving to 
death but more of hunger and disease." 
  The impact of the food shortage on the long-term development 
plans of the country is a concern: "It is difficult to switch 
from a subsistence economy when farmers are out foraging for 
food and their energies cannot he diverted to more productive 
ventures," says Ms. Haq-Perera. 
  WFP's temporary office, which was opened in February 1992 to 
help the Lao government and people cope with the after-effects 
of the 1991 floods which devastated the rice-bowl provinces of 
the south, is now entering its third emergency operation. Last 
year 3,000 tonnes of WFP aid was distributed to drought-stricken 
northern provinces of Luang Namtha, Houa Phan, Xieng Khouang, 
and Phong Saly. 
  In response to this year's emergency appeal, a total of 
around 19,000 tonnes of rice has so far been pledged by WFP, 
Canada, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, and the European Union. 
Non-Governmental Organisations [NGO], including World Concern, 
Care, and World Vision, are assisting with distributing the rice. 
  The biggest task now facing those involved in the emergency 
operation is getting the rice to the villagers before the worst 
affected communities are cut off by the monsoonal rains. "Many 
areas will be cut off for months when the rains set in in a few 
weeks. The NGOs we work with in some areas fear the rains will 
leave them with stocks they cannot deliver or distribute," says 
WFP emergency coordinator Steve Keller. Donor assistance is now 
required for the administration, logistical support, and 
monitoring. 
  The 1,000 or so inhabitants of Nasenoi village recently 
received delivery of 55 tonnes of WFP rice. World Concern 
efficiently supervised the distribution and district 
record-keepers took thumb prints as eligible people collected 
their correct allocation. 
  However, the long-term solution to this chronic food 
shortage 
problem, explains Ms. Haq-Perera, is the Government's 
agricultural policy to bring more land into cultivation with 
small scale irrigation schemes and by encouraging crop 
diversification. This will ensure that the food supply 
situation is no longer so vulnerable to the vagaries of the 
weather.

  [Text] Laos, where mountains, forests and water resources 
are in abundance, has a unique potential which is not evident in 
its neighbours for the development of hydro-power on a large 
scale. 
  In its policy on industrial development, the Lao government 
has attached great importance to the expansion of hydro-power 
plants. With its own input combined with assistance and loans 
from friendly countries and international financial 
institutions, the Lao government has in the past years tried to 
exploit this potential. This has also provided opportunities for 
investors to participate in various forms, such as joint 
ventures, build-operate-transfer projects and so on. 
  One example is the construction of a hydro-power plant at 
Seset in the southern province of Saravane. The Seset plant came 
on line a few years ago and has a generation capacity of 45 
megawatts, more than enough for domestic consumption in the 
whole south of the country. The Seset power plant is the second 
largest in the country, second only to the Nam Ngum Power Supply. 
  Last month, the state-run electricity company, Electricity 
du 
Laos, signed a contract with a French company, SOGREAH, for a 
survey to be conducted at Nam Leuk. In the same month, the 
Committee for Planning and Cooperation signed a memorandum of 
understanding with Thai company MDX Public Co., Ltd. on the 
development of the Nam Ngum Three Hydro-Power Project. The Nam 
Leuk water flows into Nam Sang and Nam Ngum, while the Nam Ngum 
Three project is located at the junction of Nam Ngum and Nam Ma. 
  The local electricity company has received a loan for the 
Nam 
Leuk project from the Asian Development Bank. Estimated cost of 
the project is U.S. $90 million. The project is expected to 
produce 40 megawatts of power. 
  As provided in memorandum of agreement for the Nam Ngum 
Three 
project, the Thai company will conduct a survey at a cost of 
U.S. $1 million. Once completed, the project will be capable of 
producing 400 megawatts of power. In this venture the Lao side 
will hold a share of 45 percent with the balance held by the 
Thai company. 
  Laos earns 800 million baht (U.S. $32 million) a year by 
selling electricity from its Nam Ngum power supply to Thailand. 
Revenue from the export of electricity represents the second 
largest source of foreign exchange for the country.

<F P=106> [Feature by Soumountha: "Nam Theun-Hinboun Hydro-Power </F>
Project Poses No Treat to Environment"] 
  [Text] "Nam Theun-Hinboun Hydro-Power Project poses no 
threat to environment." That was a welcome answer given to 
"VIENTIANE TIMES" reporters by the Project Manager. 
  In fact, this Hydro-Power project signed on April 20 augers 
well for the farming villages of the once-dry Nam Hai basin 
through possible small-scale irrigation systems taken into 
consideration under the Theun-Hinboun Hydro-Power Project. 
  Accessible by car, 300 km from Vientiane via Routes Nos. 13 
and 8, the project site is located roughly 100 km upstream of 
the place where Nam Theun meets the Mekong. The location thus 
lends itself perfectly for the purpose of developing an existing 
natural resource to earn foreign currency for the country. The 
Power Station when completed is expected to generate enough 
energy and income three times higher than that of Nam Ngum Power 
Station. 
  The combined technical know-how of the surveyors, designers, 
and construction engineers has resulted in this ingenious plan. 
The plan in brief is to construct an intake weir across Nam 
Theun at a point where a narrow mountain ridge separates the Nam 
Theun basin from the Nam Hinboun basin which lies at a lower 
level. The 240 metre difference in elevation will be fully 
exploited for power generation through a trans-basin diversion 
in that the water flow of Nam Theun will be diverted by 10 km of 
waterways into Nam Hai, a tributary of Nam Hinboun, eventually 
to the Mekong about 30 km upstream of Thakhek. In actual fact, 
water from Nam Theun will flow along a tunnel cut through the 
mountain, then down a 300 metre long inclined steel-lined 
pressure shaft, along a 650-m long steel-lined pressure tunnel 
to the power station on the other side of the mountain. The 
power station has an installed generating capacity of 210 MW 
(Megawatts). The water will then be discharged into Nam Hai 
through a 4-km long tailrace canal. 
  The 230 KV (Kilovolt) transmission line strung directly to 
the Thai border at Thakhek will be 100-km long. Beside the 
foreign currency earned, the Theun-Hinboun Power Project 
envisages power supply to meet future demands in Savannakhet and 
Thakhek, if the demand is high enough to justify the cost of a 
sub station. 
  Theun-Hinboun Power Project is the first attempt for private 
participation in the power sector in Laos. 
  This run-of-river hydropower development will be developed, 
owned and operated by the Theun-Hinboun Power Company Ltd., 
(THPC). Substantially all the power generated will be sold to 
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). 
  THPC is the combined efforts of Electricite du Laos (EDL, 55 
percent), Nordic Hydropower AB (NH, 25 percent) and MDX Power 
Company Ltd, (MDX, 20 percent). 
  THPC is established with a capital of U.S. dollar 110 
million. Asian Development Bank provides a U.S. dollar 60 
million loan towards EDL's equity contribution. THPC's debt 
financing will be arranged from a mix of commercial sources and 
export credits with a 30-years concession period. 
  Actual construction on site will begin at the end of this 
year's rainy season, and the Project will be commissioned in the 
third quarter of 1997. Commercial operation is expected to 
commence September 1, 1997. 
  Nordic Hydro Power (NH) will manage implementation of 
project 
and be responsible for operation while MDX Public Co. Ltd., 
Thailand is to handle accounting and financial management 
services. Local staff will be trained and deployed to the 
maximum possible extent. 
  There will be no resettlement or loss of cultural heritage 
because of Theun-Hinhoun Power Project. On the contrary, it 
will eliminate water supply constraints in the Nam Hai area 
during the dry season and increase fish production and improve 
navigation upstream of the diversion dam. The local community 
will benefit from improved health and education facilities, 
employment opportunities and rural electrification. 
  Theun-Hinboun Power Project will bring about the greening of 
the surrounding areas in many ways, in addition to earning hard 
currency for Laos.

  [Text] Japan and the United States have agreed to resume 
the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The Hata 
government, which is charged with the important task of patching 
up the sour Japan-U.S. relations, is expected to be able to 
avoid facing a crisis situation for the time being. The Clinton 
administration has dropped part of its trade demands on Japan 
largely because of the U.S. domestic situation, giving the 
impression that Japan has benefited from a faulty policy on the 
part of the United States. It is indispensable for the Hata 
government to frame a new macroeconomic policy, including 
reforming the current tax system, to make the July round of 
Japan-U.S. summit talks a success, but the Hata government will 
run into the difficult task of coordinating domestic views. 
Doubts have been raised about Prime Minister Hata's ability to 
handle Japan-U.S. relations because his government is a fragile 
minority government, and his ability will be tested from now on. 
  The prime minister intends to come to grips with reforming 
the current tax system with the aim of dealing with tax cuts and 
tax increases as a package on the political front, while 
watching progress in Japan-U.S. working-level trade talks on 
individual sectors for the time being. The February Japan-U.S. 
summit talks were broken off in the wake of former Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's failure to push for the "national welfare 
tax," causing the Clinton administration to distrust the 
Hosokawa government. The prime minister, therefore, has seen 
the macroeconomic policy as a trump card to break the deadlock 
in Japan-U.S. relations. 
  Opposition parties, including the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan, however, will undoubtedly resist raising the rate of 
consumption tax as a means of securing financial resources to 
make up for the fiscal shortfall resulting from continued tax 
cuts. If legislators move against raising the rate of 
consumption tax for fear of a backlash from voters at a time 
when the political situation is moving toward dissolving the 
House of Representative and holding general elections, this 
would make it even harder for the prime minister to decide on 
"raising the rate of consumption tax." 
  Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry is vehemently opposed to 
cutting the income tax prior to raising the rate of consumption 
tax. If the prime minister intends to stimulate the economy by 
adding the planned amount for the public investment prior to the 
Naples Summit, he would face even more difficulty. 
  The prime minister has repeatedly expressed his intention of 
working out plans for revamping the current tax system and 
relaxing bureaucratic regulations by the end of June, but the 
current Diet ordinary session will end in late June. The 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party and other parties are taking 
the offensive against the Hata government by suggesting that 
they will submit a nonconfidence motion against the Hata 
government to the Diet, and there is a possibility that their 
offensive against the Hata government can heighten tensions in 
the political situation. Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai once 
stated, "With regard to the macroeconomic policy, it is possible 
to break a deadlock over the policy only by making a decision 
affecting the entire political situation." How far will the 
prime minister be able to exercise his leadership in 
coordinating domestic views on the policy amid the political 
turmoil? The prime minister has no reason to feel at ease 
although the United States has softened its trade stance on 
Japan.

  [Text] Japan and the United States have formally decided 
to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that 
have been a focal point in Japan-U.S. relations. The resumption 
of the framework talks has created a situation that gives a "ray 
of hope" for the future of Prime Minister Hata, who is facing 
difficulty in handling the political situation with his minority 
government, (according to a close aide to the prime minister). 
The prime minister intends to use the resumption of the 
framework talks as a good opportunity to keep "his besieged 
minority government" floating by breaking a deadlock over 
Japan-U.S. economic relations prior to the summit (Naples 
Summit) of major industrialized nations scheduled for July. 
With the issue of continuing tax cuts still remaining unsettled 
between Japan and the United States, the prime minister aims to 
"normalize" Japan-U.S. relations by cutting the income tax prior 
to raising the consumption tax rate and then use the normalized 
Japan-U.S. relations as a lever to retake the leadership in 
handling the political situation. 
  Nevertheless, it would be difficult for the prime minister 
to 
use those steps as a means to neutralize the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party's [LDP] strategy to vote the Hata government 
out of power. The prime minister is likely to be plagued by 
"double tortures," which means his struggle to keep his minority 
government in place and to deal with a no-confidence vote 
against his government. 
  The prime minister watched with strained attention progress 
in Japan-U.S. vice ministerial talks on reopening the stalled 
Japan-U.S. framework talks that began in Washington on 19 May. 
On the morning of 23 May, the prime minister called bureau 
chiefs in charge of the framework talks in the Finance Ministry, 
the Foreign Ministry, and the International Trade and Industry 
Ministry into the prime minister's official residence to 
instruct them to do everything they could to get the stalled 
framework talks resumed. The prime minister appears to have been 
considerably wary of sluggish progress in informal consultations 
between the two countries on resuming the stalled talks. Asked 
by reporters to comment on progress in the informal 
consultations, the prime minister has always reacted cautiously 
to the request, saying: "I do not like to comment on it because 
the informal consultations are now in a delicate stage." 
  For the prime minister, whether the stalled Japan-U.S. 
framework talks are resumed or not is a crucial issue that 
"determines the fate of his government." As a minority 
government, the Hata government is being forced to handle the 
difficult political situation with the prospect that a 
no-confidence motion against it will be introduced to the Diet 
after the 1994 budget bill is passed in the Diet. At this time, 
if the Hata government fails to have the stalled framework talks 
resumed, it would further worsen Japan-U.S. relations, the 
improvement of which is the most important matter on the Hata 
government's domestic agenda. 
  If Japan-U.S. relations worsen, the Hata government would be 
placed in a very difficult position in dealing with the issue of 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and it 
would be in a "state of complete impasse" in handling its 
domestic and foreign policies. The prime minister is literally 
"surrounded by foes on all fronts." Officials close to the 
prime minister are increasingly apprehensive about the Hata 
government, saying: "A situation may be created where the Hata 
government runs for its life." 
  There is a possibility that the latest decision by Japan and 
the United States to reopen the stalled talks has made it 
possible for the Hata government to avert that worst scenario 
and given the government a momentum to strengthen its cohesive 
force (says a senior ruling party member). Many officials in 
the prime minister's official residence believe that "the 
resumption of the stalled framework talks has opened bright 
prospects for the Hata government, whose future has been 
uncertain." 
  Nevertheless, no prospects are seen for resolving the "issue 
of taking measures to open the Japanese market and cutting 
taxes", which are seen as one of the hurdles to normalizing 
Japan-U.S. relations. Meanwhile, the LDP is reacting coolly to 
the resumption of the framework talks, saying: "The Hata 
government has only narrowly averted the worst situation that 
could trigger a trade war between Japan and the United States." 
The LDP is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the 
Hata government to the Diet after the 1994 budget bill is 
passed, arguing that "the Hata government does not deserve to be 
given any high marks for resuming the stalled framework talks." 
  Commenting on the prospect of resuming the stalled framework 
talks on the morning of 24 May, a government source close to the 
prime minister said: "Mr. Hosokawa resigned as prime minister 
that way. It might be better that he resigned that way because 
government officials at the time felt a sense of crisis over the 
future of the Japan-U.S. framework talks."

<F P=106> [Comments by Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox </F>
Company and acting chairman of the Japan-U.S. Economic 
Consultative Council, on Japan-U.S. economic relations in an 
interview with ASAHI SHIMBUN economic reporter Yomei Tsuji; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] I think the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which 
collapsed in February, will be resumed in the foreseeable future 
since Washington is changing its attitude. 
  At the summit with former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
in 
February, U.S. President Bill Clinton had to be tough toward 
Japan. Because his administration had criticized the former Bush 
government as being weak-kneed toward Japan, Clinton had to 
adopt a result-oriented policy in talks with Hosokawa on 
macroeconomic measures to rescue the Japanese economy and on 
such trade sectors as automobiles, auto parts, and insurance, 
which symbolize the trade ties between the two countries. 
  Moreover, at the time, he was severely criticized at home 
for 
the Whitewater land deal. To ease the criticism and win in an 
off-year election scheduled for September, Clinton had to 
disprove the evaluation of him that "although the President 
makes courageous remarks, he does nothing." 
  Thus, he could not say "yes" to Japan's macroeconomic 
measures, including a single-year tax cut plan. 
  I believe Washington's attitude began to change in 
mid-March. 
  When I visited the United States in early April with other 
Fuji Xerox executives, I met with a top manager of a U.S. 
company. This influential businessman criticized the whole span 
of the Clinton administration's trade policies toward Japan and 
other countries, saying: "Its policies are too hard to bring a 
solution." 
  In the background of his criticism, there is the fact that 
the Japanese bureaucrats' repeated assertion that "the United 
States is demanding the setting of numerical targets, which 
would lead to managed trade" has gradually been accepted in 
Europe and other countries, and this tendency is also seen in 
the United States. I am sure Washington feels resentment 
against this trend, but.... [as published] 
  Circumstances surrounding the U.S. economy have also 
changed. 
Washington now has to check inflation. It has changed its 
exchange policy to prevent the dollar from further depreciating. 
The policy is different from that adopted in February, when 
high-ranking U.S. Government officials repeatedly made remarks 
in favor of the appreciation of the yen and the depreciation of 
the dollar. 
<H5>  Japan Should Not Presume on a Soft U.S. Stance </H5>
  Even some U.S. Government officials have begun to question 
the Clinton administration's excessive emphasis on economic 
issues in its diplomacy. Thus, it would be no surprise if the 
United States tries to seek cooperation from Japan in dealing 
with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The Office of 
the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which was a little too 
tough in the trade talks, is also criticized for its hard-line 
policy. 
  How should Japan respond to the change in the U.S. attitude? 
I think when the government makes a decision on tax reform 
during June, it should decide to implement income tax cuts next 
year and the year after as well. Also, it should indicate as 
many specific measures as possible to open wider Japanese 
markets in its external economic policy outline. 
  In view of the fact that the Hata Cabinet is a minority 
government, Washington will not make urgent demands. But Japan 
should not give the impression that it is presuming on a soft 
U.S. stance. It also should not think that "we win because we 
are right, and because we are right the United States has begun 
to show the white flag." 
  Such things are necessary because if Japan-U.S. relations 
worsen, it will have an adverse impact on the economies of not 
only the two nations but also Asia and the world. 
  "The Japan-U.S. relationship is the most important in the 
world." This famous phrase is what former U.S. Ambassador to 
Japan Mike Mansfield said when he plainly described the gravity 
of Japan-U.S. relations. President Clinton has also made 
similar remarks. 
  Historically, Japan has followed the same path as the United 
States for half a century, since WWII ended in 1945. There are 
numerous things in Japan that have been influenced by the United 
States. They include the Constitution, the education system, 
and the market control system, which has formed the Japanese 
economy's foundation. 
  Economically, Japan-U.S. trade occupies a overwhelmingly 
large portion of world trade. The relationship of 
interdependence, or what can be called the unification of the 
two countries, has rapidly progressed since the eighties. Now, 
without Japanese-made parts, U.S. industries cannot flourish. 
Conversely, U.S.-made software is holding up the Japanese 
high-tech industry. As such, a firm mutual aid system has been 
erected. 
  When the world economy's growth is slowing down, what should 
Japan and the United States do to maintain their mature, huge 
economies' growth while respecting each other's position? This 
is an important question of the day. 
  What is important to the future is the 
Japan-U.S.relationship 
in Asia. The economies of China and other Asian countries are 
rapidly growing. Naturally, Japan has an interest in these 
areas. The United States also tries to make inroads into Asian 
markets, and it is considering preventing Japan from 
monopolizing the markets. 
  Meanwhile, Asian countries strongly hope that Japan and the 
United States maintain their close relationship because they 
want to seek cooperation from the United States in security and 
big technology arenas, and cooperation from Japan in technology 
for civilian products and economic fields. 
<H5>  Japan Needs To Make Known Its Efforts to Other Countries </H5>
  Some people argue that the United States, which always seeks 
a target for its hostility, will target Japan, instead of the 
Soviet Union, now that the Soviet Union no longer exists in the 
post-Cold War era. This is not a lie, but we should not attach 
exaggerated importance to it. 
  The major cause for the worsening of bilateral relations is 
Japan's trade surplus. It is inevitable that other countries 
call the current situation abnormal, in which Japan continuously 
registers a huge surplus in trade with not only the United 
States but also the European Union (EU) and Asian countries. We 
also have to think it abnormal. 
  However, some economic experts point out that figures about 
Japan's trade surplus are inaccurate because services trade is 
belittled in calculating them. Even so, the problem is that 
there is actually a widely accepted view that because of Japan's 
trade surplus, many Americans have lost their jobs. 
  It is said that although the United States imports many 
Japanese-made goods, Japan has closed its markets to U.S. 
products by exercising unfair trade practices. This assertion 
has spread with exaggeration and has deepened U.S. distrust of 
Japan. This cannot be ignored. 
  Japan needs to take actions to reduce its trade surplus, and 
make known its efforts to other countries. We should think that 
objective criteria and numerical targets discussed in the 
Japan-U.S. trade talks are aimed at reducing Japan's trade 
surplus. They are not fundamental, grave issues between Japan 
and the United States. 
  There are arguments that although the United States has a 
20- 
percent share in the world market, its market share in Japan is 
a mere 2-3 percent, and this is unusual; and that the United 
States lacks efforts to increase its market share in Japan. The 
issue of setting objective criteria is different in nature from 
such unproductive arguments. The purpose of setting objective 
criteria is to have some mutually agreeable, qualitative, and 
quantitative yardsticks to gauge the effectiveness of trade 
surplus-cutting and market-opening measures. 
  If it is difficult for the Japanese and U.S. Governments to 
set up objective criteria, the private sector should take over 
the task. And with the agreed criteria, the two nations should 
equally promote the opening up of their markets. 
<H5>  Ozawa Should Play a Role as Coordinator </H5>
  Once the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks reopen, we have to 
make sure that they function properly this time. 
  To that end, we need able men on both sides who are capable 
of easing the trade friction. On the Japanese side, (Shinseito 
Chief Secretary) Ichiro Ozawa should come to the front to become 
a major cabinet minister so he can play a role as coordinator in 
a dignified manner. Acting as coordinator in his present 
position would be questioned at home and in the United States. 
On the U.S. side, Vice President Al Gore should be prepared to 
come to the front. 
  I also would like to propose establishing a consultative 
body comprising not only politicians and bureaucrats but also 
private sector representatives. 
  Because the Hata Cabinet is a minority government, it is 
uncertain what will happen after the 1994 budget bill clears the 
Diet. This may be the reason that politicians are reluctant to 
make clear-cut remarks. The politicians' evasive attitude will 
make it inevitable to put a lot of weight on bureaucrats, but 
excessive weight on the administration is undesirable. I think 
if private sector representatives participate in the trade talks 
and raise questions, this will help cut back dominance by 
bureaucrats. 
  The important thing is for Japan to actually reduce its 
trade 
surplus. 
  Opening up of the Japanese autos, auto parts, and insurance 
markets is a main topic in the Japan-U.S. trade talks. Japan 
should actively correct Japanese companies' management and 
traditional business practices because they are major obstacles 
to opening these markets. 
  Japan also needs to reduce the number of government 
regulations. Deregulation will help increase Japan's imports and 
give an opportunity to people in the monetary, communications, 
broadcasting, and other sectors to create new businesses. A 
system should be established under which workers, who become 
jobless because of deregulation, can find new jobs in other 
sectors. 
  Moreover, Japan needs to increase its public works 
investment, especially in new social infrastructure. It is 
important for the nation to improve social infrastructure to 
better the quality of lives, and to set up information and 
communications networks, an area in which Japan lags behind the 
United States. Also, the government should reduce its 
expenditures without complaining about the severe financial 
condition. 
  Japan must carry out these things on its behalf, although it 
will bring pain to the nation. It should stop producing 
everything. It should entrust some industries to other nations. 
I believe this is the duty Japan should fulfill as an advanced 
nation.

<F P=106> [Article by Iwao Nakatani, Hitotsubashi University </F>
professor: "Proclaim the Slogan of `Reducing the Price Gap 
Between Japan and Other Countries by Half' and Make the 
Bureaucracy Assume Responsibility"] 
  [Text] The three Administrative Reform Promotion 
Headquarters [formed during the Hosokawa administration] working 
groups, which were taken over by the Hata administration, have 
been studying details of deregulation measures so that the final 
draft can be released by the end of June. 
  This writer attended a "Working Group on Import Promotion, 
Improvement of Market Access, and Distribution" meeting as a 
member. Frankly speaking, under the present situation, I think 
the group can hardly hammer out fundamental deregulation 
measures that can meet expectations both at home and abroad. It 
is almost impossible to alter the government offices' attitude 
of defending regulations. They hardly understand the market 
mechanism. 
  This time, like in the past, details of deregulation 
measures have been basically decided on by government offices. 
Regardless of whether the government offices are doing it 
intentionally, they always choose areas where there is little 
resistance from industries, where the government offices do not 
lose their vested interests, and where they suffer little "pain" 
for deregulation. This is the reason for the failure to hammer 
out effective deregulation measures. 
  Although it was obvious that the result would turn out to be 
this way, there was no other choice but to entrust government 
offices with forming deregulation measures. This is because the 
politicians themselves have become "Zoku-giin" [Dietmen who 
lobby for business, industris, and particular government 
ministries and agnecies], and they help the government offices 
defend their vested interests. In addition, there is the fact 
that politicians are not well informed about the actual state of 
the regulations. Actually, it is impossible not only for 
politicians but also for outsiders to understand the very 
details of the extremely complicated regulations. 
  Moreover, in cases where the private sector urges 
politicians 
to abolish regulations, the private sector has its own motives. 
As a matter of course, the private sector will refrain from 
talking about benefits resulting from regulations. After all, 
only the parties concerned can understand the actual situation 
of regulations. 
  To resolve such a problem and achieve substantial results in 
deregulation, it is necessary to create a "situation under which 
bureaucrats will benefit by positively promoting deregulations." 
In other words, a situation where heavy penalties will be 
imposed on those government offices failing to promote 
deregulation has to be created. 
  It is difficult to come up with brilliant ideas. In the 
first place, I want to suggest that the basic principle for such 
revision should first be clearly stated when reviewing existing 
regulations. One of the principles I want to suggest in respect 
to the spirit of the recommendations made by the Hiraiwa 
Economic Reform Study Council is that "the economy should be 
free of control in principle." Another is that "policies that 
can be implemented in developed countries should also be applied 
to Japan." In other words, it is the principle of not 
permitting "Japan's special circumstances" to be used as an 
excuse. These two principles should be clearly proclaimed, 
government offices should be monitored on whether they proceed 
with their tasks according to the principles, and then results 
of monitoring should be published. (These tasks are expected to 
be assigned to the planned third-party monitoring group, 
"Administration Reform Commission"). 
  It is also important to announce concrete targets as the 
government's commitments to guarantee that these principles will 
be carried out. For example, prices of products at home are now 
40 percent higher than those in other developed countries. The 
government should set the target of "reducing price differences 
by half within five years" as the concrete target for 
deregulation. I heard that the ruling coalition parties 
discussed this matter during their policy consultations. I 
would like the Hata Cabinet to resolutely announce this target 
as its official commitment. 
  To be more precise, the government should announce these 
principles and targets and make the government offices assume 
the responsibility for carrying them out. If the Hata Cabinet 
upholds the target of reducing the price gap by half within five 
years, and the government offices assume responsibility for 
achieving it, public opinion will enthusiastically support the 
Hata Cabinet. The minority Hata Cabinet is ultimately supported 
not by cheap tricks in steering Diet affairs but by strong 
public support. Therefore, a drastic commitment like this will 
be a strong boost to the Hata Cabinet. 
  Bureaucrats will surely argue that there is no clear 
correlation between easing regulation and the price differences 
between products sold at home and overseas. They are also 
likely to strongly oppose making a commitment to evade assuming 
responsibility for reducing the price gap. However, Japan's 
economic situation is extremely tough. If the government fails 
to diminish the price gap and to lower domestic commodity prices 
to a level closer to the present foreign exchange rate, which is 
100 yen against the dollar, the Japanese economy cannot survive. 
  To save the present Japanese economy, I think it is 
essential 
that the Hata Cabinet do something extraordinary, such as 
issuing a "declaration on reducing the price gap between Japan 
and other countries by half." While I oppose proclaiming 
"numerical targets" as official commitments, I support issuing 
this "declaration." I hope Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will 
make a courageous decision.

CSO 

  [Text] A price collapse on steel is in progress. The 
instigator is Tokyo Steel. The price is 55,000 yen per ton for 
Tokyo Steel, whose entry in steel plate, which had been a 
product monopolized by blast furnace manufacturers, began in 
April. Not only is it cheaper than the price of blast furnace 
manufacturers said to be 90,000 to 100,000 yen, but even South 
Korean products, and President Masashige Iketani does not 
hesitate to say, "Controlled pricing by blast furnace 
manufacturers has maintained high prices." 
  The silent pressure of the blast furnace manufacturers to 
shut out imports and maintain price order is normal in the 
industry. Steel processors who are called shearing and coil 
centers fear the opposition of blast furnace makers and have not 
spoken openly about dealing in import steel. The major trading 
companies also have not dealt openly in imports. 
  The market control power of those blast furnace makers now 
has begun to waver. "If the foreign and domestic price 
differential is not eliminated, the export industry will no 
longer be able to keep going." That is because voices of revolt 
from major consumers such as autos, shipbuilding, and home 
appliances have seethed up. Moves to use cheap South Korean 
steel, such as by Mitsubishi Motors, also are becoming a 
reality. The blast furnace makers have been driven to lower 
steel prices for autos and shipbuilding. 
  The "domestic-foreign price differential" is not just for 
consumer goods. According to the report of a major trading 
company with the title, "Comparison of Taiwanese, South Korean, 
and Japanese Steel Costs," "calculated at $1 to 125 yen to 783 
won to 25.75 yuan, the cost per ton is $587 for regular Japanese 
steel, about 60 percent higher than $370 for Pohang Iron and 
Steel Co. (POSCO), and 353 dollars for China Steel (CSC)." Cost 
reduction to the level of international prices, specifically 
"dropping to the price of POSCO" where the wages of steel 
workers are said to be one-fourth that of Japan, now has become 
the watchword of the blast furnace makers. 
  "In the case of petrochemical products, the Asian market has 
become borderless" (Susumu Hashimoto, manager of Resin Division, 
Mitsui Petrochemical Industries). There is a high tariff for 
U.S. and European products, but the import offensive from South 
Korea and Taiwan taking advantage of the preferential duty 
framework is intense. Ten percent of the demand has been 
replaced by import goods for polyethylene film for supermarket 
plastic bags or trash bags. 
  "The price of Japanese polyethylene is 70 to 80 percent 
higher than the United States or South Korea" (Daiwa Research 
Institute). The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] forecasts that import goods will account for 20-30 
percent of petrochemical products in the near future. 
  "The collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 began the worldwide 
deflation," points out Yoichi Ito, head of the Exchange 
Operations Office of Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking. "The former 
socialist countries, which have low costs, have been 
incorporated into the market economy system, and their products 
have begun to flood world markets all at once. Prices inevitably 
will tend toward standardization" (Ito). 
  In addition to NIE's (newly industrializing economies) and 
developing nations with the ability to supply, the former 
socialist countries also have become supply nations. On the 
other hand, no place in the world has enough demand to absorb 
that. 
  The prices of international products, which are a reflection 
of the world economy, are gradually improving after the great 
bottoming at the beginning of 1993, but viewing real prices 
which are adjusted by the inflation rate of advanced nations, 
"Only crude oil and gold are at the same level as during the 
1960's, and agricultural products, nonferrous steel, etc., are 
from one-third to one-fourth" (Marubeni Research Department). 
Even if prices do not go down, a mechanism where "they will not 
increase" easily has been created worldwide. 
  In Japan, high yen acceleration has restricted the lowering 
of prices. "In the Japanese economy, when a yen rate higher than 
$1 equals 130 yen takes root, the domestic-foreign price 
differential will come to have decisive significance" (Nomura 
Research Institute). The procurement of materials from overseas 
is rapidly spreading. 
  Sanyo Electric put together high yen emergency measures by 
order of the president in the summer of 1993 and worked out a 
policy of "procurement from abroad with the most advantageous 
price." Change to import goods in steel for compressors, plastic 
products, and printed circuit boards and other electronic parts 
is beginning. The goal of the overseas purchase ratio, which had 
been 8 percent in fiscal 1993, "will be over 10 percent this 
fiscal year." 
  While Suminoe Textile, the largest maker of interior 
materials for autos is demanding that synthetic fabric 
manufacturers lower prices to international price levels, they 
are studying whether they should import from South Korea or 
Taiwan BCF nylon for car seats that will be used in new cars 
this fall. It is a defensive measure because "the move from auto 
manufacturers on materials suppliers to lower prices has 
accelerated all at once since the beginning of this year" 
(Director Kanichiro Kishigami). The wave of overseas materials 
procurement is going back upstream. 
  A return to half of the drop from peak to bottom is called a 
"half-price return." The forecast that, "even if the economy 
fully recovers, there will be a half-price return of steel 
prices at the most" (President Toshio Kokure, Kawasaki Steel) 
may be too optimistic in view of the reality that international 
prices will determine the upper limit.

  [Text] The YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide public 
opinion poll 21-22 May to survey the approval rating of the Hata 
Cabinet that came to office in late April. The poll's outcome 
showed that the Hata Cabinet gained a 51.6-percent approval 
rating, the fourth highest approval rating following the 
Hosokawa, Tanaka, and Miyazawa cabinets. Meanwhile, the outcome 
of the poll showed a 34.2-percent disapproval rating of the Hata 
Cabinet. Explaining reasons for approval of the Hata Cabinet, 
the surveyed said: "The Hata Cabinet appears to be intending to 
do something new," or "the Hata Cabinet is better than the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] cabinets." Explaining reasons 
for disapproval of the Hata Cabinet, more than of 40 percent 
said: "The prime minister holds no real power" or "the Hata 
cabinet is unstable." In this way, many of the polled revealed 
their criticism of influence wielded by Ichiro Ozawa, 
representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN undertook an emergency telephone opinion 
poll in late April right after the Hata Cabinet was inaugurated. 
The poll at the time showed a 56.8 percent approval rating of 
the Hata Cabinet. The latest poll was conducted as part of the 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN'S regular monthly poll. According to past polls 
on cabinets conducted shortly after their inauguration, the 
Hosokawa Cabinet gained a 71.9-percent approval rating in the 
September 1993 poll, the Tanaka cabinet won a 60.5-percent 
approval rating in the October 1992 poll, and the Miyazawa 
cabinet gained a 60.5-percent approval rating in the November 
1991 poll. As a result, the Hata Cabinet's approval rating in 
the latest poll is the fourth highest following the rating of 
three successive cabinets. The Hata Cabinet's approval rating 
is the seventh highest compared to the approval rating of all 
cabinets, far exceeding the 49 percent approval rating of the 
Suzuki Cabinet in the September 1980 poll. 
  Explaining reasons for approval of the Hata Cabinet, 36 
percent of the polled said, "The Hata Cabinet appears to be 
intending to do something new"; 32 percent said, "The Hata 
cabinet is better that the LDP cabinets"; 30 percent said, "The 
Hata cabinet is eager for political and economic reforms"; and 
25 percent saying, "The prime minister is trustworthy." 
Explaining reasons for disapproval of the Hata Cabinet, 42 
percent of the surveyed stated, "The prime minister holds no 
real power"; 41 percent stated, "the Hata Cabinet is unstable"; 
and 32 percent stating, "The Hata Cabinet appears to be doing 
nothing." 
  Looking at the Hata Cabinet's approval rating by sex, 54 
percent of the females surveyed approved of the cabinet while 49 
percent of the males approved, showing the same ratio given to 
the Hosokawa and Kaifu Cabinets. Looking at the support rating 
by party, 26 percent of the polled supported the LDP; 11 percent 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 7 percent the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]; and 3 percent the Japan New Party, 
Komeito, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. The Japan New Party, 
which once had the second highest support rating following the 
LDP, suffered a sharp fall in the support rating after Mr. 
Hosokawa resigned as prime minister and one legislator after 
another have quit the party. The SDPJ, which backed out of the 
ruling coalition, suffered a minor fall in its support rating 
from the previous poll without increasing its rating. Shinseito 
and the LDP increased 1 percentage point in their support rating 
from the previous poll.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, Liberal Democratic Party </F>
member of the House of Representatives and former deputy primer 
minister, by unidentified editorial staff member: "Objections 
to Prime Minister Hata"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When you expressed your intention 
to leave the party, a serious situation seemed to be created 
with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] being split vitally, and 
the political world being reorganized, though, after all, such a 
situation did not actually occur. Please tell me your frank 
impression. 
  [Watanabe] It was because I was too optimistic in grasping 
the situation that I failed to realize my intention while 
creating the serious confusion within the LDP. I want to deeply 
apologize for creating such a confusion while the time was not 
ripe. 
  However, it was a most noteworthy tendency seen during the 
recent confusion that there was a change of factional alignment 
based on policy consensus. The contents of the policy consensus 
originally reached between the coalition parties and me has 
changed considerably. I feel I can be proud of myself for 
separating from the coalition parties for that reason. The fact 
that our alliance turned out to be a failure proved, expressed 
reversely, that the policy consensus I proposed was regarded as 
a basis of factional alignment. Therefore, I do not feel 
ashamed at all. As I firmly believe, I am totally prepared to 
accept public criticism. I am not feeling as serious as people 
might expect. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] From an early stage, you have been using the 
words "save-the-nation cabinet." 
  [Watanabe] I have been using the words for half a year. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In declaring that you were to save the 
nation, you must have been seriously determined. Yet, the fact 
that, after all, you remained in the LDP makes the general 
public feel that your attitude is irresolute. 
  [Watanabe] I suppose people will feel that way. I cannot 
help being criticized for my behavior. However, you cannot be 
allied since the difference between our policies have been 
revealed, can you? In dealing with the problem of security, the 
coalition parties do not express their positive support, but 
they are simply to maintain or to succeed the same attitude of 
the preceding administration. It is also not clear whether or 
not they are in favor of making emergency laws. At a midnight 
news conference held 21 April, the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] chairman said that the party was opposed to making 
emergency laws. It is also not clear how the party is going to 
deal with the consumption tax. Besides, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], the key party, had accepted the policy, which is 
different from ours. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In the first place, when did the move to be 
allied with the so called "reformists" -- Shinseito and Komeito 
-- emerge within the [LDP]? 
  [Watanabe] To explain the background, I have to trace back 
to the time when the Hosokawa Cabinet was formed. When it 
became necessary to choose whether the coalition government was 
to include or exclude the LDP, Hosokawa and Sakigake [Harbinger] 
members, being incited by the mass media, preferred to form a 
government excluding the LDP. In addition, Shinseito also 
strongly rejected the LDP. Then, though the reasons are not 
clear, Shinseito and Komeito were about to be allied. As a 
result, the Hosokawa administration was formed without any 
policy agreement. 
  Seeing this process, I thought this government is fragile, 
and felt that, unless a policy agreement is reached, it will be 
inevitable that the government will collapse in the near future, 
in less than a year. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] It did not last even one year. The Hosokawa 
administration collapsed in eight months, did it not? 
  [Watanabe] I thought the government would last at least 
until June or July. However, being unable to clear the 
suspicions cast upon him, Hosokawa suddenly threw out the 
government. I myself was surprised. His act is extremely 
irresponsible. 
  Now, what is important for us is that, in forming a new 
administration, we should not repeat the same stupidity. The 
ship of state will not be able to move forward or backward 
unless boarded, at least, by people of the same thought. 
  Why Watanabe Thinks the National Welfare Tax Is Reasonable 
  Then, suddenly, the suspicion about nuclear development by 
North Korea surfaced. If North Korea refuses to accept UN 
inspection to the last, sooner or later, it will become 
inevitable for the United Nations to give economic pressure. In 
a worst case scenario, it is possible that an economic blockade 
may take place. When we try to see what Japan can do under such 
a situation, we realize that, not having an established 
emergency law system, Japan is totally unable to deal with such 
a situation. 
  In short, it is my fundamental concept that, if a new 
government is to be formed, it should consist of members of the 
same opinion to be able to deal with various problems. 
  If I refer to Japan-U.S. relations, I believe that Japan 
should support the Security Treaty. Some people say that, since 
the Cold War is over, it will be enough to maintain or to 
succeed the same policy as the preceding government in dealing 
with the Security Treaty. However, when trade conflicts are 
ceaselessly taking place between Japan and the United States, we 
should realize that the only way for Japan to keep ties with the 
United States is to support the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. By 
all means, we should be positive in supporting the Security 
Treaty to not have the important ties loosened. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When the Hosokawa administration proposed 
introducing the national welfare tax, you were the only person 
in the LDP to support the proposal, were you not? 
  [Watanabe] No, I did not necessarily give my consent to the 
national welfare tax. I agreed to the idea that indirect taxes 
should be increased to secure fund sources for welfare in the 
future. In fact, I myself was surprised. Anybody would be 
surprised if suddenly told that the consumption tax is to be 
abolished and a 7 percent national welfare tax is to be 
introduced. If I were him, I would have taken a more moderate 
way. I will fully explain the reason. Since the social 
security expenses are to largely increase toward future, we need 
to secure fund sources to support the long-living society. 
Then, I will tell the people that, if business conditions 
recover, the consumption tax rate may be increased by, for 
instance, 2 percent two years later. And, after that, taking 
the changing situation into consideration, I will tell the 
people that, maybe in five years, the tax rate will be increased 
another 2 percent. Basically, I simply wanted to say that it 
was acceptable to give more weight to indirect taxes and to 
review the ratio between direct and indirect taxes. 
<H5>  I Wanted To Act As a Go-Between </H5>
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Anyway, some people within the coalition 
parties agreed that your idea was acceptable, did they not? 
  [Watanabe] It is true that Shinseito, Komeito, and the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], etcetera, thought that my 
opinion was agreeable. Of course, they made approaches to me. 
I could not say such a thing if there were no approaches at 
all. Though I cannot tell with whom I met and what we talked 
about, it is true that I felt I could work with them. It is 
also true that we discussed the possibility of forming a group 
centering around my policy, as I mentioned before. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] A news report says that there was a secret 
talk between Watanabe and Hosokawa on 23 February, and that you 
met with Ichiro Ozawa twice at the beginning of April. The 
report says that Prime Minister Hosakawa asked you to join the 
cabinet, and that Ozawa asked your intention about assuming the 
post of prime minister or deputy prime minister. What is the 
truth? 
  [Watanabe] Well, since everything is over, I want to refrain 
from commenting on the subject. Anyway, though I felt that I 
could work with them, they had to save their own face. Since 
they have been acting as a non-LDP group, their face does not 
allow them to join the LDP. 
  However, if they are seriously concerned about the state and 
the people, it is reasonable for them to ask for LDP assistance 
even if the next prime minister is to be elected from among the 
coalition parties. Even in case it is not possible to do so 
because of the time limit, it is possible for the people who 
maintain a sound conservative idea in a good sense and the 
people who maintain a nonsocialistic idea to join together since 
these people share the same idea with the majority of LDP 
members. 
  Therefore, I thought I might be able to play the role of a 
go- between. I wanted to become a bridge between the two groups 
by forming a new political party by myself or with several other 
members. 
  However, I gradually came to realize that there was strong 
opposition to my idea within the SDPJ, and that certain members 
of other parties were also against my idea. Under that 
situation, I had, in the first place, to secure members to 
support me to replace members who were against me. And, above 
all, through the repeated discussions, I had come to realize 
that we could not reach a policy agreement. Under such a 
situation, it became meaningless to form a new political party. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] After all, it was the SDPJ's opposition 
that became a bottleneck, was it not? 
  [Watanabe] If we take the Constitution problem alone, it is 
true there are people of different opinions even within the LDP. 
I never intended to say that something should be done about 
Article 9 of the Constitution. It is all right to leave the 
article as it is. However, I wonder if the existing Constitution 
is totally flawless as it is. What I am saying is that we need 
to study the Constitution a little further. For example, the 
ownership of land and the right to use land are too strong, 
making it impossible to construct an additional runway at Narita 
Airport while 15 years have already passed. Not enough 
consideration is being paid to public interests. Also, not 
enough consideration is being paid to the claim on minimum legal 
inheritance, and no provision is being incorporated about 
environmental rights. In many aspects, the Constitution is 
outdated. 
  Yet, the SDPJ's so-called absolute defenders group even 
prohibits studying the Constitution, not to mention reviewing 
it. I cannot work with such fellows. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] During the talks with Ozawa you referred to 
before, naturally you talked about forming, if you can secure 
the necessary numbers, a Watanabe administration excluding the 
SDPJ, did you not? 
  [Watanabe] I leave my answer to your imagination. I should 
not make practical comments calling people by name. Though I do 
not think that anybody will believe me if I say there was no 
communication at all.... 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] A political commentator says that Mitchii [a 
nickname for Michio] Watanabe was hypnotized and was made a 
puppet by Ichiro Ozawa. He says Ozawa kept two cards -- Hata 
and Watanabe -- and used them at his will. 
  [Watanabe] I suppose so. He tried to shake the SDPJ with 
such tactics, and forced the party to accept their intention to 
the extent possible. It is not strange at all if he had such an 
intention. It is natural for him to use such a tactics as a 
professional politician. 
  Yet, even if I was used as a card, I think I could 
contribute 
to the national interests if such a process could help the SDPJ 
grow to be a sound political party capable of dealing with the 
world situation. I think the SDPJ has also been brainwashed to 
follow a way of thinking similar to ours. 
  That I was used as a card has its own value if the SDPJ 
changes its policy emerging from being blinded by avarice. 
Whatever the general public may say about me, I do not regret 
it at all. Besides, I understand that the SDPJ's rightist group 
is beginning to show their understanding about the problems of 
security and making emergency laws. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Let me trace the recent situation. On 13 
April, the news reports said all at once that it had been 
decided that Tsutomu Hata would be the successor. However, the 
situation has suddenly taken a new turn as the news was spread 
on 14 April that Watanabe was leaving the party. Ozawa also 
said at a news conference that the wheel was turning, and that 
history keeps moving. It seems that, at this point, Ozawa was 
also thinking of forming a Watanabe administration. Can you 
explain where and how the scenario was changed? 
  [Watanabe] After all, as I said before, it was impossible 
for me to be allied with the coalition parties while bearing the 
LDP label. I suppose Shinseito and other parties were also of 
the same opinion. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Under such a situation, there was a final 
choice of you leaving the LDP and running for prime 
ministership. In that case, you could have won a large number of 
LDP votes. 
  [Watanabe] I suppose so. I was confident that there would 
be more LDP votes than I expected supporting my nomination for 
prime minister. However, there was no guarantee that all the 
members who voted for me would join my group. Similarly, I 
imagine Ozawa and other leaders will also be feeling anxious. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] You mean that to vote for you does not mean 
joining your group, do you not? 
  [Watanabe] Yes, you are right. However, it is also possible 
that a new situation can be created through the voting process. 
After all, we are not sure whether it was a hen or an egg that 
came first. 
  Repulsion Against the "Ichi-Ichi Line" [from 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa] 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] The Hata Cabinet has been formed after much 
commotion. In your own words, the coalition parties are going 
to repeat the same stupidity, are they not? 
  [Watanabe] So long as the Hata administration is formed 
including the SDPJ, the administration will face, sooner or 
later, a difficult situation. The coalition parties will face 
the difficulty because they are being connected simply because 
they want to be in power. If they are seriously concerned about 
policies, they may ally with us instead of the SDPJ. 
  Perhaps they are not to be awakened unless they experience 
hardship once again. They will remain totally ignorant unless 
they take bitter medicine again. It is unfortunate. It is a 
very unfortunate thing for the people. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When the political situation is in a great 
confusion, is it allowable that they "repeat the same stupidity"? 
  [Watanabe] I think Ozawa also shares the same recognition 
that we are in a serious situation. That is the very reason why 
some people of the coalition parties feel that they should have 
been more broad-minded in forming the coalition. 
  It is true that, even within the coalition parties, there is 
a furious repulsion against the "I-I lines" formed by Ichiro 
Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa. Of course, there is also a serious 
repulsion within the LDP. After all, it is their tactics that 
are being opposed. 
  Perhaps, they will have the bill proposing the divisions of 
the single-seat districts approved at the next Diet session. 
After that, they will force unnecessary candidates not to run 
for the Diet. They will threaten the candidates that the bill 
has already passed; that they are to fight the LDP at the 
single-seat districts on equal terms; and that, should the SDPJ, 
the DSP, and Shinseito put up their own candidates, there is no 
guarantee of winning the election if the LDP comes up with only 
one candidate, etcetera. This way, they intend to crash [the 
LDP]. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Formerly, you mentioned that Ozawa is too 
sharp in expressing his likes and dislikes about people, and 
that he is too hasty in doing things, did you not? 
  [Watanabe] I think he is also doing the same thing this 
time. Therefore, as far as tactics are concerned, I do not think 
I can agree with him. Though the difference may come from the 
difference of age and character, I doubt he can keep his 
influence for a long time if he always behaves like Nobunaga 
[Nobunaga Oda, a dictatorial leader during the age of civil 
wars]. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Nobunaga first comes out of the castle by 
himself. Then, he orders his men to follow him. 
  [Watanabe] We have the saying that an appropriate time, an 
advantageous position, and the people's harmony are important. 
After all, things do not go well if we disregard the people's 
harmony. Yet, even if the people's harmony is important, we 
should not compromise with parties having different policies as 
it means that we are being blinded by avarice. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Talking about the future situation, is it 
possible that you may be allied with Shinseito again? 
  [Watanabe] I am willing to form a coalition. We intend to 
work together toward a future with those people who share the 
same philosophy with us. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] At this point, let me ask you a question. 
There is criticism about your being allied with Komeito because 
you have been severely criticizing Komeito. 
  [Watanabe] Komeito has also changed. As we see from what 
they say, the party seems to have tacitly admitted the necessity 
of [increasing) the consumption tax, it does not express any 
objection about supporting the security structure, it admits the 
necessity of cooperating with the United Nations, and the party 
is even ready to review the Constitution. 
  Though some people say that the nature of the Soka Gakkai [a 
religious group supporting Komeito] has also changed, it will 
take a long time before the people admit it. First of all, it 
is necessary for the Soka Gakkai to be recognized in the 
religious world. The group should no longer pursue its 
customary expansionism and exclusionism. The group that behaves 
as if the Soka Gakkai was the only religion should correct its 
attitude. Of course, it is not possible to correct its attitude 
in a year or two. 
  At any rate, I think it is all right to be allied with 
Komeito as far as our policies agree. To be allied means to 
ignore details and to uphold principles. In short, it is an 
expedient. They do have the word expedient in the sutras 
(laughter). However, it would be a big problem to be merged 
into one party. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] What is your opinion about the Hata 
administration's future? 
  [Watanabe] After all, I think they have taken a temporary 
measure -- an emergency evacuation. Even if I were asked to 
form an administration within the existing framework of the 
coalition parties, the only way for me would have been to form a 
temporary administration. Any administration formed without an 
agreement of fundamental policies reveals its fragility the 
moment it faces various practical problems. Since the people of 
different thoughts and beliefs are boarding the same vessel, 
some will pull their oars toward the east, and others toward the 
west. Regretfully, the administration will not last long. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Some people say the administration's life 
may be less than two months. 
  [Watanabe] Though I am not sure if it will be two months, I 
do not think it will last long. Throughout the world, there 
have been few coalition cabinets that lasted very long. Through 
such a severe test, politicians are gradually classified either 
as rightists or leftists. Though, of course, it takes time. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] In case political confusion is created in 
the near future, do you think there is an opportunity for you to 
go on stage? 
  [Watanabe] Though I am not sure if there is an opportunity 
for me, at any rate, I want to have the groups of the same 
political vision and of the same policies allied, and I want to 
act as go- between. I also want to play the role of a mediator 
to terminate the politics of hatred. When the time comes, I am 
willing to openly discuss the matter with dignity. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] When you were determined not to leave the 
party and not to run for the prime ministership, you mentioned 
that "I still do not have to be in a hurry." Is that your real 
view? 
  [Watanabe] Yes, it is. There will be another opportunity. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Will the opportunity come in the very near 
future? 
  [Watanabe] Yes, the opportunity will come in the very near 
future. The political regime will change again and again. The 
world is always full of vicissitudes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiyoshi Iijima, member of the Posts and </F>
Telecommunications Advisory Council, and Masayuki Fukuoka, 
professor of political science at Hakuo University, by AERA 
editor Nobuo Kobayashi; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa's Strategy 
  [Kobayashi] Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa tried 
to spur the next move to realign political forces. What was his 
scheme? 
  [Iijima] The object of his strategy is to provoke further 
splitting of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Ozawa knows 
very well what "politics by numbers" is, because he grew up as a 
member of the LDP's most powerful faction headed by Kakuei 
Tanaka. This is why he is most concerned about the LDP's 
strength, which is still above 200 seats in the 511-member Lower 
House. This is also why he played the Watanabe card during the 
search for a new prime minister [Ozawa tried to split up the LDP 
by offering the premiership to LDP faction leader and former 
deputy prime minister Michio Watanabe]. Ozawa wanted to preserve 
his party leader, Tsutomu Hata, as a future choice for prime 
minister, because a "behind-the-scenes strongman" really gives 
full play to his ability only when the prime minister is 
selected from another political group. Unfortunately, Ozawa was 
forced to play the Hata card. Now that he has used up this 
precious move, he cannot let the new administration be 
short-lived. He thought that the policy accord reached by the 
coalition parties was not enough to support the Hata 
administration. He keenly felt it was necessary to unite 
coalition members into a parliamentary group. This is why he 
schemed for the formation of a parliamentary group, called 
Kaishin [Reformation]. However, he made a big miscalculation: 
The Kaishin project brought about the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan's [SDPJ] pullout from the ruling coalition. Ozawa 
expected the departure of some SDPJ members who have been 
reluctant to participate in the ruling coalition, but he thought 
there would be no more than 10 defectors. 
  [Fukuoka] Ozawa's strategy is aimed at taking control of the 
Diet through the influence of Shinseito, which holds only 
one-eighth of the seats in the powerful Lower House, by forming 
a chain of majority. First, Ozawa wanted to make Shinseito the 
largest party in the ruling coalition. Then, he wanted to unite 
Shinseito with other parties, such as the Japan New Party [JNP] 
and Komeito, to hold 160-180 seats in the Lower House. At the 
same time, he wanted to split up the LDP so that his newly 
formed party could become the largest single party in the Diet. 
By playing the Watanabe card, Ozawa tried to kill two birds 
with one stone. Playing the Watanabe card was intended to 
trigger further splitting of the LDP, while keeping the Hata 
card for later use. Ozawa also wanted to alienate SDPJ Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama [who is a member of the party's left wing] 
from the Democrats [a study group consisting of rightist members 
of the SDPJ]. 
  However, his calculation went wrong. He could neither 
dismantle the LDP nor preserve the Hata card. Moreover, the 
SDPJ bolted from the coalition. Ozawa did not anticipate how 
SDPJ lawmakers would feel when they abruptly learned about the 
formation of Kaishin. Thanks to his rationalistic idea, 99 
percent of his plan was successful. However, he made a mistake 
at the last moment because of his impetuousness. This brought 
about his own ruin. 
  [Kobayashi] Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi decided to join other coalition parties in forming the new 
parliamentary group, although he had once placed greater 
emphasis on cooperation with the SDPJ and New Party Sakigake. 
Why did he change his mind? 
  [Iijima] Ouchi felt more and more isolated within the ruling 
coalition since Sakigake decided to support the Hata 
administration from outside of the cabinet. He quickly came 
round to the idea of creating a parliamentary group, Kaishin, 
because he did not want to join hands with the SDPJ without 
Sakigake's presence. Ouchi and DSP Secretary General Takashi 
Yonezawa met with Ozawa on 23 April to wrap up their discussions 
about Kaishin's formation. 
  [Kobayashi] May I ask you a simple question? Why does not 
Ozawa become prime minister, since he is believed to be the most 
influential politician? 
  [Iijima] It is not correct to say that he would not make 
himself prime minister. I should rather say that he cannot 
become prime minister, because a strong leader provokes strong 
antipathy. Moreover, Ozawa has not yet managed to remove all 
apprehensions regarding his health condition [several years ago 
he was hospitalized because of heart problems]. 
  Ozawa believes that quality can change quantity. At the same 
time, he thinks that the converse is also true. This is why he 
seeks too much after quantity. However, quantity and quality 
are also contradictory to each other, because what we gain in 
quantity we may lose in quality. Ozawa is shy and sensitive by 
nature. He does not like to do something striking before 
others. He came to acquire the undemocratic way of jumping to a 
conclusion by ignoring the process, because he received his 
political education from powerful LDP leaders. Although he 
fears the LDP's strength in terms of the number of seats in the 
Diet, he looks down on each LDP member. 
  [Fukuoka] I strongly feel his enthusiasm in defying 
postwar taboos. Ozawa served late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, 
former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and former Deputy Prime 
Minister Shin Kanemaru. All during this time he saw that the 
LDP has always managed to steer clear of such questions as the 
rice issue and the interpretation of the Constitution's 
war-renouncing article. He saw Japanese politics being left to 
the mercy of the bureaucrats. This is why he has a preeminent 
fighting spirit. He built his own logic by listening to others, 
particularly to bureaucrats. His concept of an "ordinary 
nation" is an example. Communism has Marx as its matrix. In the 
same way, Ozawa's ideology has its own matrix. Ozawa denies 
everything outside his framework. For example, Ozawa looks the 
other way when reporters ask him about a subject that is 
unfamiliar to him. 
  As he was close to former LDP power broker Shin Kanemaru, he 
knows the pleasure of being a behind-the-scenes strongman. 
However, at this moment, being a behind-the-scenes strongman 
should be a pain rather than a delight, because the political 
scenario turned out to be the worst. 
<H5>  The Lifeline of the LDP and SDPJ </H5>
  [Kobayashi] Ozawa maneuvered behind the scenes to support 
LDP faction leader Watanabe in his bid for prime minister. What 
frustrated his plot? 
  [Iijima] The major cause of his failure was that Yasuhiro 
Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, and Kiichi Miyazawa have presented a 
united front against him. Ozawa thinks that the end justifies 
the means. He set forth an unreasonable argument that Watanabe 
would be automatically considered a pro-reform leader if he left 
the LDP to join the ruling coalition. Such an argument was 
inadmissible to the three ex-prime ministers. 
  Miyazawa made every effort to prevent his faction members 
from deserting, without concealing his grudge against Ozawa, who 
had maneuvered behind the scenes to pass a no-confidence motion 
against Miyazawa's government. Nakasone dissuaded rank-and-file 
members of the Watanabe faction [which is the former Nakasone 
faction] from leaving the party, by relieving them of their 
anxiety. Nakasone apparently said that he would help them win 
re-election. 
  [Fukuoka] The LDP itself has no strategy. However, the 
three ex-prime ministers, who have managed to make Ozawa play 
the Hata card, are now examining the possibility of paving the 
way for a dissolution of the Lower House. The day his 
government comes to an impasse, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will 
be forced to dissolve the Lower House instead of having his 
cabinet resign, because the ruling coalition has no more 
alternatives for prime minister. 
  The three ex-prime ministers are probably aiming at killing 
the political reform legislation by driving the Hata 
administration into a corner and by forcing the prime minister 
to dissolve the Lower House. 
  [Kobayashi] Why did the SDPJ bolt from the coalition? 
  [Iijima] The proverb says, "A baited cat can grow as fierce 
as a lion." This applies exactly to the SDPJ. During the 
discussions for building a policy platform for the new 
government, the SDPJ could not but make vital concessions to 
preserve the coalition's unity. The SDPJ also came very close 
to being forced to admit Watanabe into the coalition. The SDPJ 
was really humiliated. As a reaction, it opted out of the 
coalition. It made the decision in one stroke, after it was 
deprived of chairmanship of the meeting by coalition 
representatives, and after it realized that it might receive 
fewer cabinet posts and fewer parliamentary vice-ministerial 
posts under the new government. 
  [Kobayashi] Sakigake had planned to form a grand alliance 
with the LDP and SDPJ under the banner of "Protection of the 
Peace Constitution." Was the plan really realizable? Will this 
scheme come to the fore again in the near future? 
  [Fukuoka] If Sakigake wants to form an alliance, it has to 
prove that it will sacrifice its own interests for the public 
good and that it will treat its coalition partners with due 
respect. Otherwise, the alliance is not possible. With the 
SDPJ's departure from the ruling coalition, the formation of a 
liberal alliance between Sakigake and the SDPJ is now possible. 
  Many SDPJ lawmakers have received a considerable number of 
phone calls from their supporters, who favor the formation of a 
new government free from Ozawa's influence. 
  Meanwhile, Sakigake's move to form an alliance for 
protection 
of the Peace Constitution with some LDP members has not vanished. 
  [Iijima] I think Sakigake's plan to form an LDP-SDPJ grand 
alliance was superficial. Unlike Ozawa, Sakigake leader 
Masayoshi Takemura has a too optimistic way of thinking. To 
begin with, Takemura thought that if he could persuade former 
Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda [a well-known LDP reformist] 
into becoming the leader of the alliance for protecting the 
Peace Constitution, many other LDP members would follow suit. I 
just cannot understand how he can view things as being so simple 
and so easy. 
  [Fukuoka] Morishige Goto, chairman of the 1-million-strong 
All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, is eager to 
have Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi as a new leader. Goto 
hails from Hokkaido, while the Workers' Union belongs to the 
Japan Trade Union Confederation or Rengo, the umbrella labor 
union group that supports both the SDPJ and DSP. Yokomichi 
might become the leader of the liberal forces advocated by 
Sakigake. However, on the other hand, Rengo is still in contact 
with Ozawa. Rengo is now caught in its own schemes. 
  Another Political Crisis May Arise in June 
  [Kobayashi] What is the Hata administration's character? 
  [Iijima] It is a government controlled by Shinseito. It is 
clear that the Hata administration differs from the Hosokawa 
administration in character. As a behind-the-scenes strongman, 
Ozawa of today is too much in the forefront. There are also too 
many shaky factors. 
  In terms of policy, Ozawa has a tendency to advocate 
categorical cooperation with the United States. However, Prime 
Minister Hata has slightly different ideas. 
  [Fukuoka] As foreign minister, Hata was a politician 
following in the footsteps of the bureaucrats. However, 
concerning Japan's wartime responsibility, Hata's view is rather 
close to that of Hosokawa's. Hata values cooperation with the 
United States, but he also has his own point of view regarding 
Asia. There is a great possibility that friction might arise 
between Hata and Ozawa. Will Hata be able to make decisions as 
a top leader if such occasions arise? That is the question. 
  [Kobayashi] Prime Minister Hata was obliged to form a 
minority government. Many people think that it will be 
short-lived. 
  [Fukuoka] The situation is that a no-confidence motion 
against him can pass the Diet at any time. The LDP will 
probably maneuver to pass the motion at an early stage so that 
the next general election will take place under the old 
electoral system of multiseat constituencies. Another change in 
government might happen after the end of June. 
  [Iijima] The Hata administration might end as a government, 
the sole mission of which is to pass the long-stalled fiscal 
1994 budget bills. Within the LDP, there is now a widespread 
view that the Lower House will be dissolved in July and that the 
next general election will be held under the old multiseat 
electoral system. 
  The LDP foresees that the ruling coalition will be forced to 
scrap its tax reform plan, which is expected to be presented by 
the end of June, because it will certainly be opposed by the 
SDPJ. This would give the LDP an opportunity to present a 
motion of no- confidence. 
  [Fukuoka] After the enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget, the 
implementation of tax reforms will become a crucial issue. I 
also think that people will start crying for an early election 
focusing on the tax issue. There might be a general election 
under the old multiseat system, in the character of a 
quasi-plebiscite on the tax issue. The view regarding the next 
political crisis is based on these factors. 
  If the next general election is held under the multiseat 
electoral system, most of the 50 LDP candidates who ended up as 
runner-ups in the last election are expected to make comebacks. 
All of them might not remain with the LDP, but it is probable 
that the LDP will get about 25 more seats in the Lower House. 
Ozawa is aware of that, but the problem is that he does not 
have any good moves to make. The day the Hata administration 
comes to an impasse, it will hardly be possible for Ozawa to 
tide over the crisis by having the cabinet resign as a makeshift 
measure. The only way left is to split up the LDP somehow or 
other so that the framework of the coalition can be changed. If 
it is not possible, dissolving the Lower House for a general 
election is unavoidable. However, since the LDP does not have 
any workable strategy, the question is whether the Hata 
administration will be able to avoid a deadlock until summer or 
not. 
  [Iijima] I doubt if Ozawa really thinks highly of Hata and 
if he really wants to make the Hata administration a 
full-fledged government. 
  Probably, Hajime Funada [Ozawa's close aide] is Ozawa's real 
choice for future prime minister. It seems to me that Ozawa is 
trying to preserve his influential power until Funada gets 
trained to be an executor of national reformation. 
<H5>  What Will Political Realignment Bring? </H5>
  [Kobayashi] What will be the pivot in the next phase of 
political realignment? 
  [Fukuoka] As Sakigake has been saying, there was a 
methodological problem. At least, it is certain that Ozawa's 
top- down approach to decisionmaking, his way of making a tool 
of Watanabe, and his quantity-oriented approach, are 
undemocratic. 
  Policy goals will no longer be the pivot in the next phase 
of 
political realignment. The new pivot will be such factors as 
the method or the sense of values. 
  [Iijima] People will care more about political ideology. 
Freedom is contradictory to equality in some respects. 
Protection and regulation are aimed at equalizing some one with 
another one. Ozawa wants impartiality and equality. 
  Impartiality indicates equal opportunity. Here, the 
principle of competition comes into play. We should be aware 
that competition might bring about unequal results. The idea 
that opposes equal opportunity is equal results. 
  As for foreign policy, there is the U.S.-oriented diplomacy 
against the diplomacy focusing on China and other Asian 
countries. 
  A two-party system will probably take shape after two or 
three elections are held under the new single-seat electoral 
system. 
  [Fukuoka] Shinseito's and Komeito's constituencies are 
basically different. So I do not understand why the LDP does 
not devise a stratagem to divide the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. 
  Tax reform will be the next pivot. If the Government wants 
to introduce the principle of free competition, it will have to 
lighten the middle class's tax burden. If indirect taxes are 
increased, this will automatically cast a heavier burden upon 
people in the lower income brackets. 
  [Iijima] If the LDP remains as it is, it will dwindle away 
into nothing. There is no powerful leader capable of 
supervising some 200 LDP members of the Lower House. Since the 
party has so many members with so many different ideas, I think 
the LDP would better effect divorce by agreement to form two 
different parties. 
  If the party bears a different name, people will regard it 
as 
a new party, even if the personnel are the same. For instance, 
Shinseito was formed by those who defected from the LDP faction 
once controlled by Shin Kanemaru. In the last general election, 
Shinseito's polling score increased about 20 percent compared 
with the previous election. 
  [Fukuoka] So you propose a fake divorce? 
  [Iijima] Whether or not the LDP will be able to cope with 
Ozawa's strategy will depend on if the LDP effects divorce by 
agreement, or if it breaks up after falling into Ozawa's snare. 
  The LDP can split into two political groups on its own 
initiative. The first group would associate itself with the 
SDPJ, and the second group would try to form an alliance with 
the first group and the SDPJ. Some LDP members are already 
moving into this direction following the departure of the SDPJ 
from the ruling coalition.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
will send the South Korean puppet navy to the Rimpac joint 
manoeuvres to be held under the baton of the United States. 
  NODONG SINMUN today views this as a scheme to prop up the 
tottering regime and gratify its wild ambition for the 
reunification of the country through Northward invasion by 
serving the United States as its servant and shock brigade in 
the execution of its policy of aggression and war. 
  The analyst says: 
  An official of the defence agency of Japan made it plain 
that 
the manoeuvres are a dangerous military action directed against 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea when he said the joint 
operation in the Rimpac "will be a political message" to "North 
Korea over its nuclear program." 
  The United States intends to facilitate the formation of the 
U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance and, at the 
same time, establish "a collective security system" involving 
the whole of the Asian-Pacific region by inveigling South Korea 
and Japan into the manoeuvres. 
  The Korean peninsula is the first target in the "new 
military 
strategy" of the United States seeking "a new world order" after 
"the end of the Cold War." And it is the invariable goal pursued 
by the United States in its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy to 
put the Korean people on the altar of a nuclear war. The Kim 
Yong-sam group is zealously behaving as a shock brigade in the 
execution of this criminal aggressive strategy, fully revealing 
its true color as a faithful war servant of the United States 
and a group of traitors trying to slay the fellow countrymen in 
the North in league with outside forces. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop imprudently serving the 
United States in its perilous policy of war, clearly mindful 
that they have nothing to get from toeing outside forces' policy 
of "strength."

<F P=106> [Report on Press Statement issued by a Foreign Ministry </F>
spokesman on 25 May] 
  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a 
statement today regarding the fact that at the recent UN 
Disarmament Commission meeting a sharp conflict of views 
surfaced between the developing countries and the Western 
countries as to whether emphasis should be placed on the 
elimination of nuclear weapons or on the strengthening of the 
nuclear nonproliferation system with regard to the question of 
nuclear disarmament. 
  He said: 
  Many developing countries including our country strongly 
urged that the international community should take it as their 
first and foremost goal to comprehensively and totally eliminate 
the existing nuclear weapons within a certain period through 
universal and non- discriminatory multilateral negotiations and 
treaties and that the nuclear weapon states should carry out 
nuclear disarmament. 
  By contrast, the United States and other Western countries 
persisted in their old position that emphasis should be placed 
on the strengthening of the nuclear nonproliferation system in 
the present stage and, to this end, the role of the UN Security 
Council should be enhanced. 
  The guideline and recommendations on nuclear disarmament 
worked out and submitted by the Western countries, focussing on 
the nuclear nonproliferation issue, could not be passed due to 
the opposition of the developing countries. 
  The process of the meeting made it all the clearer that 
there 
is no change in the ambition of the United States and other 
Western countries to maintain their nuclear monopoly and turn 
the world around its finger. 
  The United States and other Western countries, however, 
resort to trite threats and pressure against the non-nuclear 
states including the DPRK under an unreasonable pretext while 
failing to do what they must do. 
  While raising a hue and cry over the fictitious nuclear 
suspicion against the DPRK, they pretend to be ignorant of the 
real threat of nuclear armament such as the recently discovered 
concealment of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan. 
  This can be said to be the culmination of the application of 
a double standard. 
  The problem will not be solved any time, if the United 
States 
and other Western countries continue to apply the double 
standard in the nuclear issue, refusing to accept the just 
demand of the developing countries for the total abolition of 
nuclear weapons and the removal of the discriminative nature of 
the NPT at a time when the extension of the validity of the NPT 
is being discussed.

  [Text] The South Korean puppets perpetrated a grave 
military provocation by illegally infiltrating a group of 
battleships deep into the territorial waters off our side's west 
coast on 25 May. 
  At around 1633 [0733 GMT] on 25 May, three battleships of 
the 
puppet army based in Taechong Island went into battle formation 
and deeply infiltrated into our side of the territorial waters 
south of Ochajin-ri, Yongyon county, South Hwanghae Province, to 
openly kidnap our peaceful fishing ships in broad daylight. 
  The Korean People's Army Naval patrol boat which was 
vigilantly defending the sea posts of the socialist fatherland 
went into emergency mobilization on the spot and the rascals 
rapidly fled towards the South. 
  The South Korean puppets' reckless act of infiltrating into 
the sea is stimulating North-South confrontation. This is also 
an intentional and planned provocative maneuver to drive the 
Korean peninsula toward an intense and aggravated situation. 
  This act of military provocation was committed at a time 
when 
the South Korean puppets are finding fault with our nonexistent 
nuclear issue, conspiring with outside forces to drag in 
up-to-date murderous equipment on a large scale into South 
Korea, and leading the situation to a dangerous stage by 
accelerating the increase of forces in the Military Demarcation 
Line area of the DMZ. Therefore, we cannot but all the more 
regard this as a severe situation. 
  If the South Korean puppets ignore the consistent desire of 
the Korean people and the world's peace-loving people who want 
peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula and continue to 
move toward the road of war and confrontation, the provokers 
will not be able to escape from receiving a resolute punishment.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets Commit Military Provocation on the </F>
Sea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets 
on May 25 perpetrated a grave military provocation by illegally 
infiltrating a group of combatant ships deeply into the western 
waters of our side. 
  At around 16 hours 33 minutes, three combatant ships of the 
puppet navy based in South Korean Taechong Islet infiltrated 
deeply into our side's waters South of Ochajin-ri, Yongyon 
County, South Hwanghae Province, in battle formation for the 
purpose of kidnapping our peaceful fishing boats openly in broad 
daylight. 
  They hurriedly fled South, failing to carry out their 
hostile 
scheme due to the quick sailing of a naval patrol craft of the 
Korean People's Army to the scene. 
  The reckless naval intrusion of the South Korean puppets was 
a premeditated provocation to incite North-South confrontation 
and lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to a higher pitch 
of strain. 
  If the South Korean puppets continue along the road of 
confrontation and war, ignoring the unanimous desire of the 
Korean people and the world peaceloving people for the peace of 
the Korean peninsula and its reunification, they will be meted 
out a stern punishment.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
told foreign reporters on May 23 that "the North must not try to 
settle the questions on the Korean peninsula only with the 
United States" and it "must begin North-South dialogue", 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  This is a feeble entreaty and complaint of the pitiful 
colonial puppet utterly forsaken by history and the people. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is very jealous of the North 
sitting 
at a negotiating table with the United States and feels very 
uneasy and nervous over it. 
  The traitor most dependent on outside, flunkeyist and 
treacherous among the successive rulers of South Korea, is 
trying to squeeze himself into DPRK-U.S. negotiations without 
any power and capacity, and is obstructing the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  In urging the North not to deal only with the United States, 
he was motivated by the sinister political purpose of putting a 
spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The traitor driveled about the North-South dialogue this 
time. But the puppet has no elementary qualification and face to 
talk about the dialogue. It is an intolerable mockery of 
dialogue for its very wrecker to cry for its "resumption". 
  The ulterior intention of the puppets is to create 
difficulties again to foil the third round of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks at any cost and proceed with the moves to stifle the DPRK 
in league with international reactionaries. 
  If the tense situation is to be eased in Korea and a correct 
way of settling the question be found today, the United States 
must change its hostile policy against the DPRK and such 
flunkeyist traitor as Kim Yong-sam must be removed from power in 
South Korea.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "An Absurd Remark Reflecting </F>
Their Real Intention"] 
  [Text] According to a report, on 23 May at the puppet 
national assembly's foreign affairs and national unification 
committee meeting, puppet national unification board [NUB] 
minister Yi Hong-ku, while laying the blame at our nuclear 
problem again, openly clamored that the North-South joint 
declaration of denuclearization has virtually become null and 
void. This is tantamount to promulgating the nullification of 
the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula which was adopted in 1992 and is, therefore, a grave 
challenge to our fellow countrymen and the world's peace-loving 
people who want to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. 
  Announcing the invalidity of the joint declaration of 
denuclearization, Yi Hong-ku babbled that it was because of what 
they call our nuclear problem. This is indeed a shameless 
sophistry designed to conceal their true colors. 
  It is a widely known fact that since the joint declaration 
of 
denuclearization was adopted, the puppets have hindered by all 
means the implementation of the joint declaration, including 
withholding the realization of follow-up measures for the 
declaration, while laying the blame on our nuclear problem. 
  Furthermore, the puppets have been mad only for their 
nuclear 
development manuevers while casting away the pledge they made 
before the nation. The fact that the puppets who have already 
secured a large amount of plutonium are now attempting to secure 
more plutonium by even developing fast-breeder reactors, the 
fact that the puppets have signed an agreement with Japan for a 
nuclear development program, the fact that clamoring that the 
time has come for them to have nuclear capability, the fact that 
the puppets are asserting that the national assembly should 
raise the voices calling for nuclear development, and the fact 
that they are openly talking about nucleaar sovereignty, all of 
these facts vividly show how frantically the puppets are running 
wild for nuclear development. 
  In view of these facts, we can be clearly aware that it is 
precisely the South Korean puppets who have reduced the joint 
declaration of denuclearization to a scrap of paper and that it 
is also precisely the puppets themselves who should be blamed 
for the failure in realizing the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  This notwithstanding, the puppets are laying the blame at 
our 
nuclear problem. This is none other than a foolish trick 
designed to shift to others the resonsibility for their having 
nullified the joint declaration of denuclearization by 
misleading public opinion. 
  Over 1,000 U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed in South Korea 
today, and the puppets, as well, are not only accelerating their 
own nuclear development program, but are also staging a nuclear 
war exercise everyday. Such being the situation, whether or not 
we can realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a 
very important problem which has the direct bearing not only on 
the survival of the nation, but also on the world's peace and 
stability. 
  This is why the situation of the Korean peninsula today has 
become a focus of today's world's politics. Therefore, all of 
the Korean people, as well as the people of the world, are 
strongly calling for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from 
South Korea and for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  Nevertheless, the puppets who have been raising even growing 
their own nuclear mushroom under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, are 
challenging to the joint declaration of denuclearization by 
openly announcing its nullification. 
  The absurd remark of the puppet NUB minister who has 
promulgated the nullification of the joint declaration of 
denuclearization reveals their real intention to remove the 
burdensome obstacles to their nuclear weapon development project 
and, thus, to accelerate in earnest their nuclear weapon 
development. Therefore, his absurd remark is tantamount to a 
declaration for their virtual nuclear armaments. 
  The puppets are interested neither in the nation's destiny 
nor in the country's peaceful reunification. The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique is a group of intolerable nuclear fanatics who are 
trying to increase the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean 
peninsula and to drive the nation into the disaster of a nuclear 
war. 
  The entire nation will not allow the puppets' dangerous 
maneuvers to make the Korean peninsula the site of a nuclear war 
in collusion with outside forces. The South Korean puppets will 
bear responsibility for all catastrophic consequences arising 
from their maneuvers to nullify the joint declaration of 
denuclearization. 
  As long as the Kim Yong-sam ring, a ring of nuclear war 
fanatics, continues to exist, our nation will not be able to get 
rid of the disaster of a nuclear war. Those who really oppose a 
nuclear war and who think of the destiny of the country and the 
nation should rise up and sternly check and frustrate the puppet 
clique's maneuvers for nuclear weapons development.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The South Korean Puppets Dashing on </F>
the Road of War Adventure"] 
  [Text] The South Korean ring of the war fanatic Kim 
Yong-sam is stepping up its pitch of dashing on the road of war 
adventure against the fellow countrymen. This is evidenced, 
among other things, by its frenzied maneuver for arms buildup. 
  As has been reported, the puppets, under the pretext of 
further solidifying the security posture, have decided to 
introduce additional late-model weapons, such as Patriot 
missiles and Apache helicopters. It is no secret that the 
puppets, during the warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's 
junket to South Korea last month, decided to bring in 
anti-artillery radar, a global positioning system [chisang 
mokpyomul wisong chujok changchi], and ultra- modern gun-barrel 
equipment, as well as Apache helicopters, from the United States. 
  On 12 May, the puppets deployed for active service new type 
medium-size transport planes purchased from Spain. The South 
Korean puppet clique raves that these transport planes, whose 
deployment for the puppet air force will be completed by the end 
of this year, will enhance their so-called operational 
capability. The bellicose puppet elements' arms buildup 
maneuvers--by which they deployed the new type CN-235 
medium-size transport planes, in addition to Apache offensive 
helicopters and Patriot missiles, which are weapons of mass 
destruction, in South Korea under the instigation of the U.S. 
imperialists--well expose the true colors of the U.S. 
imperialists and the puppets leading the situation to a brink of 
war. 
  The fact that the South Korean puppets are following the 
road 
of war adventure is also evidenced by their continuous war 
exercise commotions of various types aimed at northward 
invasion. As has been reported, the South Korean puppets 
conducted fire games aimed at attacking us from 9 to 14 May, 
such as the combat readiness exercise; a chemical, biological, 
radiological exercise; a troop and equipment movement exercise; 
and a combat plane emergency take-off and landing exercise. On 
9 May alone, the puppets brought a large- scale naval exercise 
group into the West Sea of Korea and conducted provocative war 
exercises, such as a marine mobile exercise, anti- air and 
anti-shore exercises, and a ship dispersion exercise, raving 
about the so-called completion of the posture for coping with 
the initial stage of war. 
  At the same time, the South Korean warmongers conducted a 
joint airborne dropping exercise and a joint open-air exercise 
with the U.S. forces on the East Sea of Korea. 
  Facts show that the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous clique had an eye on attacking us by 
three-dimensional operations from air, land, and sea through 
these war exercises. 
  As has been made public, the Kim Yong-sam ring is raving 
that 
it will conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise this 
November and enforce other war exercises as scheduled without 
reducing their scale. The Kim Yong-sam ring's reckless 
maneuvers for arms buildup and preparations for war of northward 
invasion are an intolerable act of treachery aimed at driving 
the fellow countrymen into the calamity of nuclear war as a 
perpetrator of a war of foreign forces. 
  It is the invariable policy of the United States to build up 
armed forces of aggression on the Korean peninsula and threaten 
and crush [apsal] us by force. The United States, raving about 
our nuclear development and countermeasures for our surprise 
attack, are frenziedly engaged in war commotions, massively 
bringing new type Patriot missiles and other military equipment, 
including latest- model Apache offensive helicopters, into South 
Korea. This is prompted by its desire to obliterate our 
country's socialism by force. 
  The South Korean puppets, with the United States, have 
already worked out the so-called New Operational Plan 5027, a 
plan to provoke a war of northward invasion. The U.S. 
warmongers--who have assembled vast aggression armed forces in 
and near South Korea aimed at imposing nuclear calamity on our 
nation and deployed Patriot missiles and offensive helicopters 
to South Korea--are making powder-reeking such an outburst that 
they will not hesitate to wage a war or preclude the possibility 
of a preemptive strike. 
  According to the U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST of 12 May, 
Perry and other U.S. military leaders, babbling about sanctions 
against us recently, said that a war could turn out a reality. 
This is a very serious remark. Needless to say, the South 
Korean puppets' arms buildup and fire-game commotions are 
perpetrated by this policy of aggression and war of the United 
States. The South Korean puppet clique, which is sustaining its 
filthy life depending on foreign forces, is attempting, 
foolishly, to obliterate our Republic by force and realize its 
ambition for reunifying the country by northward invasion taking 
advantage of the U.S. imperialists' reckless military action. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is attempting to intensify the arms 
buildup and war fire game under the pretext of building up a 
security posture and lead the situation on the Korean peninsula 
to a dangerous phase of war so as to leave South Korea under the 
U.S. domination permanently and to sustain its power as a cat's 
paw for its master's war. 
  Our fellow countrymen, who treasure national dignity and 
love 
peace, can never forgive the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which 
attaches greater importance to its personal comfort and foreign 
forces' interests than to national interest and destiny and 
which does not hesitate to impose the calamity of a nuclear war 
on the nation. If the South Korean puppets think they can 
realize their ambition for reunification by northward invasion 
through the reckless arms buildup and war fire-game, they are 
having an illusion. The Kim Yong-sam ring should stamp on its 
mind that the treacherous act of confronting the fellow 
countrymen leads to its shameful destruction.

<F P=106> ["Trick of Nuclear Criminal"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries recently staged the drama of "opening" to Western 
reporters the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant where 70 kg of 
plutonium had been discovered some time ago, a report from Tokyo 
says. 
  This is a trick to fool the unbiased opinion guarding 
against 
Japan which is accelerating its conversion into a nuclear power 
in full scale. 
  When foreign reporters asked why the secret of the 
accumulation of a large amount of plutonium was not disclosed 
for six years," the authorities "did not utter a word in answer". 
  The nuclear criminal who was caught red-handed in wantonly 
violating the universally accepted international law cannot be 
absolved from its crime, even if he "opened" the nuclear 
fuel-making plant to the public. 
  Still more ridiculous is that this nuclear criminal, 
shamelessly enough, has become noisier in crying over the 
fictitious "nuclear weapons development" by the DPRK. This is a 
crafty ruse to justify Japan's moves to become a nuclear power, 
which has become a target of the accusing finger of the 
international community and divert elsewhere the world's 
attention from it. 
  Judging from the fact that many nuclear reactors of Japan 
have been operating for scores of years, it is as clear as 
noonday that the exposed amount of plutonium is only a tiny part 
of the total amount of concealed plutonium. 
  The Japanese authorities must not resort to a trick to 
mislead public opinion but clearly open to the international 
community the total amount of plutonium hidden nationwide, and 
promptly stop nuclear armament.
