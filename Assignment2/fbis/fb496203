  [Text] Bratislava -- In a statement issued yesterday, 
Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac states that he learned about 
the motion by 35 deputies to recall him from the post of Slovak 
deputy prime minister from radio yesterday at noon. He 
expresses his unequivocal rejection of the accusations leveled 
against him, which he considers absurd, also because he does not 
know a single reason that prompted the deputies to come up with 
their motion. He is convinced that this motion is part of the 
unfair strategy pursued by a certain political entity, or 
entities, whose aim is to discredit their political adversaries 
at any price. 
  Slovak Prime Minister and Democratic Union of Slovakia 
Chairman Jozef Moravcik said yesterday that he was not aware of 
anything connected with the person of Deputy Prime Minister 
Roman Kovac that would confirm "inability to cope with the post 
of deputy prime minister, suspicion of attempted corruption, and 
a faulty moral profile." 
  Speaking to a TA SR correspondent, T. Cabaj, chairman of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia Club of Deputies, confirmed 
that the movement availed itself of specific evidence bearing 
out Roman Kovac's corruption. He added that they would submit 
this evidence only at the extraordinary NRSR meeting that has 
been called to deal with their motion. 
  Asked about the existence of documents that might serve as 
evidence, K. Tothova, former minister of justice, said that she 
did not know these documents.

  [Excerpts] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik was to 
leave for a working visit to Myjava and Senica today. However, 
there was a change in his program, caused by the situation in 
the Slovak National Council, where 35 deputies submitted a 
proposal to express a vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime 
Minister Roman Kovac. 
  Because the discussion of this point was expected today, as 
had been announced in the morning by Government Office Spokesman 
Lubomir Lintner, the presence in Bratislava of both these 
representatives of the Cabinet is necessary. 
  Editor Zuzana Stukovska interviewed Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik on this topic last night. She was interested, in 
connection with the discussion about Roman Kovac in the 
parliament, in whether the prime minister was concerned about 
the image of the government he is heading. 
  [Begin recording] [Moravcik] I know Mr. Roman Kovac. I do 
not think that fabrications--because I think they are only 
fabrications--could jeopardize his position. I do not 
underestimate our citizens in this regard, either, because they 
will be able to make up their own minds about the matter. 
  [Stukovska] Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS [Movement for 
a 
Democratic Slovakia] Deputies' Club, confirmed to TASR [News 
Agency of the Slovak Republic] that the Movement has at its 
disposal actual evidence linking Roman Kovac to corruption. 
Prime minister, if these findings are serious, will you ask the 
deputy prime minister to resign? 
  [Moravcik] So far, I have not had the opportunity to 
familiarize myself with these documents, and I do not think they 
exist. 
  [Stukovska] In connection with your new post, you have 
replied several times this week to the question whether or not, 
by virtue of being elected chairman of the Democratic Union, you 
were going against the philosophy on the basis of which the 
current coalition government was formed--that is, the idea that 
it would be a government without top party political leaders. 
It appears, however, that your replies have not been altogether 
convincing because Peter Weiss, chairman of the SDL [Party of 
Democratic Left], said very clearly--I quote--I do not want to 
dramatize this, but it means advantages to DEUS [Democratic 
Union of Slovakia] in contrast to other partners in the 
elections--end of quote. Prime minister, do you think that 
this, on the surface, minor reproach means the beginning of 
various coalition disagreements? 
  [Moravcik] Immediately after this, I contacted Mr. Weiss and 
we discussed this topic. We arrived at the conclusion that this 
fact cannot harm our mutual relations. This means that we know 
how to deal with the new situation, and I firmly believe that 
this assessment of the situation will last also in the future. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Stukovska] So, you assume that you will not have to prove 
that your new post will not make your party the favorite in the 
early parliamentary elections? 
  [Moravcik] It should not. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement </F>
for a Democratic Slovakia and former Slovak prime minister, by 
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The Path 
I Followed Was the Right One"] 
  [Text] Not even after having been removed from his position 
as prime minister for the second time does Vladimir Meciar feel 
defeated. For he has no doubt whatsoever that, after the early 
parliamentary elections in the fall, he will come back 
victorious at the head of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] to reclaim his position as prime minister. Much has been 
written about this 52-year-old politician during the past 
several weeks. But let us hear from Vladimir Meciar himself, 
without whom, whether we like it or not, Slovak internal 
political developments in the immediate future cannot be 
imagined. 
  [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Mr. Chairman, how do you evaluate the 
current political developments in Slovakia? Can the unanimous 
vote to hold early elections be considered something that will 
calm the situation here? 
  [Meciar] New elections will not resolve a single substantive 
problem facing Slovakia. At most, they will succeed in changing 
the representatives who are to solve those problems. The 
elections mean postponing the threat of a possible confrontation 
within society. It will take the present governing coalition a 
long time to recover from the way we maneuvered it into voting 
to shorten the electoral term. Before the vote, it was agreed 
that Weiss's SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] will not join 
the government if the new date for elections is not approved. 
But it broke this agreement nevertheless, as it did many others 
before, and the government was formed. At the same time, the 
present governing coalition did not want new elections. It voted 
in favor of the elections because it was convinced that we did 
not want them and that the law therefore would certainly not 
pass. 
  From the viewpoint of the internal political situation in 
Slovakia, the present situation is very bad. The continuity of 
all of the processes that were successfully under way was 
interrupted. Moravcik's government will be doing nothing for at 
least a month but searching for a new program or looking for 
mistakes of the old government for the sole purpose of giving 
the appearance of being better. The former, or, if you will, my 
government, was a minority government, but it came out of the 
democratic elections a winner. The present government is again a 
minority government. 
  Represented in it are both the SDL and the KDH [Christian 
Democratic Movement], as well as two steering committees of 
parties that are still in the process of being formed. Also 
represented in it is Knazko's Alliance of Democrats, which no 
one elected to the parliament. The coalition is a minority that 
is dependent on the support of Hungarian political parties. The 
same as in Jan Carnogursky's government, the Hungarian political 
parties presented their bill to this government, which it will 
have to pay willy-nilly. 
  Nor were relationships within the parliament resolved. The 
disintegration that followed the democratic elections, 
particularly in our movement because of our mistakes as well as 
external pressures, be it from the president or the then 
opposition parties, resulted in there now being 24 deputies in 
the parliament who were originally elected as representatives of 
different parties. They are now "programless" and Prime Minister 
Jozef Moravcik is "unattached"; he has no political party behind 
him. The makeup of his character allows, of course, for 
obedience in the relationship between the president and the 
prime minister.... 
  An interesting situation developed in connection with the 
fact that, in a manner unheard of in the history of democratic 
countries, the president, who does not have the right to control 
the activities of the government, utters criticism of the prime 
minister although he knew that the entire government will fall, 
and makes his own function in the government hang in the balance 
because the prime minister has different views on some matters. 
This is a case without precedence in the world. Many problems 
are related precisely to Slovakia's efforts to halt the overall 
pace of economic decline. But this situation will last for some 
time and its impact will be deeper. The desire for power with 
which a few people in party leaderships, even those who are not 
in the government today, became intoxicated was greater than the 
feeling of responsibility toward the citizens for the 
consequences. That is bad. Slovakia is also undergoing a crisis 
of personalities, a crisis of political entities, and these 
political entities have a negative impact on the country. 
  [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] While you were prime minister you were 
often criticized for centralizing power and for your 
controversial character. What do you think of such criticism, 
criticism that comes not only from the president. 
  [Meciar] To talk about centralization of power is to show a 
great lack of understanding of how, in fact, the power spheres 
of a state work. The HZDS never had a majority in the parliament 
and was always dependent on the support of somebody else. So 
what is this about centralizing power in the parliament? A 
minority that centralizes the majority?! That is indeed 
ingenious nonsense. Who then wants to talk about concentration 
of power? And that I became prime minister on the basis of 
democratic elections. That is, after all, normal. 
  I have never once lowered myself to using administrative 
instruments or power to conduct public policy. Today even many 
of my friends blame me for being too democratic, for having too 
liberal an attitude toward everybody. But even so, I think that 
the path I followed was the right one and that power is used 
only by those who do not know how to govern any other way. 
Moreover, the talk about centralization of power was heard 
mostly at the time I held the post of minister of privatization. 
I did not privatize anything for myself, my family, or 
relatives. I placed those who thought they had priority rights 
to everything in line according to importance, the same as 
everybody else. The slogan "Stand in line and wait to see if you 
are better" was felt as a threat by many. That is why they began 
spouting nonsense. 
  We all have a certain character makeup, and political 
personalities in particular cannot be such that they suit 
everybody. In all of us there is something good, something bad. 
Show me a person who is ideal.... It simply cannot be a flesh 
and blood human being. But I am glad that it is mostly my 
character traits that are being criticized because that means 
that no faults are being found with my work. 
  After everything I experienced during the four years of my 
political life, and obviously will yet experience during these 
six months, I think that each of us writes his references 
through his own work. Whether people want a certain politician 
must be decided precisely through elections, not by the person 
who sits next to me and thinks I should play second fiddle or by 
someone who holds another position and thinks his function is 
more important, maybe in just one power structure, and someone 
else would suit him better. If you do not have a majority in the 
parliament, the president is in opposition to you, the courts 
are independent, and so try to talk about concentration of 
power. Lord, forgive those who do not know what it is! 
  [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Constant attacks on President Michal 
Kovac are incensing the crowds. People have a feeling of 
uneasiness, which will probably end only after the new 
elections. Are such attacks on the president necessary, and will 
they be part of your election campaign? 
  [Meciar] There is a good passage in the Bible that says woe 
to those with whom scandal originates. I do not think at all 
that the president is being attacked. Rather, I believe that 
Michal Kovac's actions are engendering a justified anger among 
the citizens. The point is that the president does not have the 
right to step beyond the constitutional sphere of activities and 
powers the Constitution accords him. When he goes beyond the 
scope of his powers, the citizen has not only the right but also 
a duty to protest. 
  The president simply cannot ignore the political will of the 
citizens, the president cannot intrude into political parties 
and try to break them up, the president cannot engage in 
intrigues--whether openly or covertly--against a government that 
was formed on the basis of democratic elections. But, if he does 
that and thinks he is justified in staying in office, he is very 
much mistaken. The only decent solution is for him to resign in 
the interest of the stability and purity of national life. 
  I do not believe we need to stoop so low as to mount some 
kind of attack on Mr. Kovac, who, by the way, used to be my 
deputy in the HZDS. After all, he will take care of everything 
himself.... Everyone is the architect of his own good fortune or 
misfortune. I, too, proposed him for president of the Republic. 
Today, I must admit, I should not have done it. 
  [ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY] Eighteen people have already left the 
HZDS deputies' club. According to our information, there are 
still a number of people in the movement who have social 
democratic tendencies or lean toward other parties of the 
center. Do you suppose that in the preelection period a further 
splintering will take place within the HZDS? 
  [Meciar] The HZDS meets Slovakia's needs by its stable, 
strong, centrist position. Therefore, no turn to the right, no 
turn to the left, but straight ahead! That is why the HZDS also 
had mass support among the voters. This movement could not be 
broken up from the outside--only from the inside. Pressure 
could be applied from the outside, but, without allies on the 
"inside," the objective would not have been achieved. The first 
signal for departure was Knazko's signal, with whom seven people 
left. He failed as a politician, he failed as a government 
official. Naturally, he blames his failures on somebody else. 
  The departure of another group from the HZDS was connected 
with Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik. True, their work came under 
extremely critical scrutiny in my government. They felt 
themselves personally threatened, and they reacted by trying to 
break up the club, taking with them eight persons. They created 
the so-called alternative, but, basically, even before they 
created it, they talked with the opposition about forming a new 
government.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Unpopular Measures on the Horizon"] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- "The International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) should establish close contacts with the emerging World 
Trade Organization (WTO). We support the view that industrially 
advanced countries should limit trade barriers and, from the 
very beginning of this new trade era, open their economies more 
to states undergoing transformation," Deputy Prime Minister 
Brigita Schmognerova said at the annual IMF meeting in 
Washington yesterday. Her speech was the first by a 
representative of independent Slovakia at this forum. Together 
with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, she 
represented the group of IMF states that are undergoing 
transformation. 
  Brigita Schmognerova said that latest experience testifies 
to 
the IMF's greater flexibility in relation to the need for the 
social acceptability of the transformation strategy. In this 
process, the IMF almost unilaterally emphasizes the formation of 
a social net, however, which places great demands on budget 
expenditures. These expenditures among the main causes of 
budget deficits, according to Schmognerova, rather than the 
subsidizing of state-owned companies. Vice President of the 
European Union (EU) Danny Christophersen explained the EU 
program to assist transforming states and the loan in support of 
macroeconomic stabilization. According to Deputy Prime Minister 
Brigita Schmognerova, Slovakia, too, will seek to obtain this 
credit from the EU. 
  "We assume that some consumer taxes will be changed and that 
the value-added tax for some products will be raised, which will 
be reflected in prices. The government would have to take these 
measures in the interest of eliminating the risks of the budget 
management, even if it did not strive to obtain the stand-by 
loan from the IMF," Brigita Schmognerova said after her talks 
with IMF Executive Director William Kiekens and head of the IMF 
mission to Slovakia Emmanuel Zervoudakis.

<F P=106> [Article by "r": "Slovak Republic Citizens' Approach to the </F>
Speeches Made in Parliament on 9 and 11 March 1994"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Citizens' views on the speeches made by 
President Michal Kovac and then Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
during the 27th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic were monitored by the Public Opinion Research 
Department of the Slovak Statistical Office in the first 10 days 
of April. The extent of respondents' lack of information about 
the two speeches was the same, with one-third of the respondents 
stating that they did not know the contents of the speeches. 
  Approximately one in four (24 percent) of the 1,287 
respondents accepted the president's speech fully, 27 percent 
accepted it with reservations (they agreed only with some of its 
parts), and 16 percent expressed a negative attitude. 
  Views on the former prime minister's speech were slightly 
more negative. The evaluation of the contents of Vladimir 
Meciar's speech shows that there were 5 percent fewer approving 
reactions (19 percent) and 3 percent more disapproving reactions 
(19 percent). The proportion of those who agreed with 
reservations was 2 percent higher than with respect to the 
president's speech and represented 29 percent. 
  In expressing their views more specifically, the respondents 
applied several levels of assessment. When asked to evaluate 
spontaneously the contents of Michal Kovac's speech, respondents 
expressed their greatest appreciation for the fact that it was 
truthful (20 percent). The opposite view (that the speech was 
not truthful) was expressed by 8 percent of respondents. The 
president's criticism of the government (or, respectively, Prime 
Minister Meciar) was endorsed by 9 percent of respondents, while 
11 percent rejected it. 
  When assessing the contents of Vladimir Meciar's speech, 
some 
23 percent of respondents did not consider it truthful, while 16 
percent held the view that the former prime minister was 
speaking the truth. One percent of respondents endorsed 
Meciar's criticism of the president, while 5 percent rejected it. 
  Specific views on the speeches in parliament were expressed 
only by respondents who were familiar with their contents. 
  The responses were collected between 1 and 8 April 1994 from 
1,287 citizens of the Slovak Republic above age 18, 
representative in terms of sex, age, level of education, 
nationality, size of the community of residence, and region of 
Slovakia.

that, while being divided by their past, they are united by the 
closeness of their programs. The most hotly debated issues were 
the possible formation of a single electoral ticket, the 
possibilities of other parties joining in, and the formation of 
a bloc of civic accord [blok obcianskej dohody]. The parties 
are interested in the votes of their electoral base not getting

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Confederation of Trade Unions Will </F>
Remain Apolitical"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--At a regular meeting in Bratislava 
yesterday, participants in the Assembly of the Confederation of 
Trade Unions (KOZ) dealt with labor safety and health protection 
issues, the development of employment, and the implementation of 
an active employment policy. They discussed a proposal 
concerning KOZ's involvement in the election campaign and 
internal trade union issues. 
  According to the trade unionists, the level of employment 
has 
declined, in particular, in the branches of agriculture, 
industry, and construction. In their opinion, not a single 
government has adequately addressed this problem. No 
comprehensive concept has been drafted, and no basic direction 
of policy has been determined. It is therefore necessary to 
carry out a consistent analysis of the labor market and the 
effectiveness of financial resources spent [on employment 
policy]. As far as the management of state administration is 
concerned, the trade unionists regard as the best solution the 
management of labor offices and the regional Employment Fund 
bodies from a single center. 
  The participants in the assembly noted that KOZ will become 
involved in the elections only through individual trade unions 
and will not give support to any political party. They asked 
KOZ president Alojz Englis to communicate to the prime minister 
of the Slovak Republic the trade unionists' dissatisfaction with 
the speech made by Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Julius 
Brocka at the Sixth Conference on Trade Union Cooperation in 
Europe.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Bielik and Stefan Hrcka: "Partly Disclosed </F>
Party Finances"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava -- Yesterday's second day of the 
30th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
[NRSR] ended prematurely, owing to a deputies' boycott. Ludmila 
Muskova (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS) told the 
plenum shortly after 1600 that deputies for the HZDS and the 
Slovak National Party [SNS] had been discriminated against at 
yesterday's meeting of the parliamentary culture committee 
because they did not receive background documentation for a 
discussion on the statutes of the Slovak Television Council. 
[passage omitted] 
  Subsequently, a part of opposition deputies did not present 
themselves during a vote and NRSR Deputy Chairman Peter Weiss 
(Party of the Democratic Left, SDL), who chaired the meeting, 
had to declare the meeting closed because Parliament did not 
have a quorum. 
  At the outset of its meeting yesterday, the NRSR took note 
of 
the Slovak Prosecutor General's report on the state of legality 
in 1993. [passage omitted] Subsequently, deputies decided with 
final validity on the fate of the NRSR law of 18 February 1993 
on the payment of the state compensatory allowance and child 
allowances. The fate of this law has been undecided for more 
than a year after, on 1 March 1993, then Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar returned the law to the NRSR for another discussion 
because it did not place families under the obligation to 
furnish evidence of the level of their income. On 22 February 
1994 the Slovak Constitutional Court confirmed the validity of 
the law's return and Parliament therefore discussed the law anew 
yesterday. Opening the debate on the law, Minister of Labor, 
Social Affairs, and the Family Julius Brocka (who, as deputy, 
had submitted the original draft) said that, at the time of its 
submission, the aim of the bill was to speed up the drafting of 
a new, more equitable, and more specifically targeted law on 
child allowances. According to Brocka, the government has 
already prepared the draft of such a new law and the law of 18 
February 1993 has therefore lost justification and Parliament 
should reject it. After polemical statements by some opposition 
deputies, the NRSR finally abolished the returned law. [passage 
omitted] 
  After the lunch break, the plenum elected by secret ballot 
Jozef Kosnar (SDL) as chairman of the NRSR National Economic and 
Budget Committee and Bohumil Kacmar (Democratic Union of 
Slovakia, DEUS) as chairman of the NRSR Committee for 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management. Stefan Kvietik 
(National Democratic Party-New Alternative) became chairman of 
the NRSR Committee for Education, Science, and Culture, after 
Marian Andel (SNS) failed in the vote. Parliament also elected 
new members of its commission that deals with the problems of 
the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros system of hydroelectric power projects. 
Jan Weis (SDL) was elected chairman of the commission and Jan 
Krivcik (Christian Democratic Movement) and Jozef Prokes (SNS) 
were elected commission members. 
  Subsequently, at a closed meeting, the deputies assessed a 
report on the submission of political parties' and movements' 
annual reports on their financial management in 1993 and agreed 
with its being made public. Of the 54 registered parties and 
movements, 13 failed to submit their annual reports to 
Parliament. [passage omitted covered by referent item] The 
report states that, in contravention of the law, several 
political entities did not announce the names of donors who had 
donated one-time gifts with a value of more than 10,000 korunas 
or a total of more than 50,000 korunas in the course of the 
whole year. Parliament's report did not specify, however, which 
parties did not meet this obligation. [passage omitted] 
  After the discussion of annual financial reports, Parliament 
was supposed to vote on supplementing the parliamentary 
commission for supervising the activity of the Slovak 
Information Service. Because of the incident described above, 
however, the meeting was suspended and is to continue today.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Trade Deficit for January and February; </F>
Czech Republic Is Slovakia's Largest Trading Partner"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Republic's foreign trade 
turnover in the first two months of the year reached a sum of 
60.5 billion korunas [Sk] (in trade parity) and was 39.6 percent 
higher than in the same period a year ago. The Slovak Republic 
imported in this period Sk32.2 billion worth of raw materials 
and products, 52.8 percent more than in the same period a year 
ago. The value of Slovak exports--Sk28.2 billion--went up 27.1 
percent, compared with the first two months of 1993. The Slovak 
Republic's foreign trade balance for this period thus shows a 
deficit of Sk3.9 billion. This transpires from an analysis of 
the development of the Slovak Republic's foreign trade carried 
out by the Slovak Statistical Office. 
  Slovakia's key trading partner was, also at the beginning of 
this year, the Czech Republic, which absorbed 37.6 percent of 
Slovak exports and accounted for 30.4 percent of Slovak imports. 
The second-most-important partner was the FRG, with which 
Slovakia realized 18.7 percent of its exports and 11.2 percent 
of imports, followed by the Russian Federation, Hungary, and 
Ukraine. In the first two months of the year, the Slovak 
Republic achieved a surplus of Sk1.9 billion in its trade with 
the countries of the European Union.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Bohumir Gerinec, director of the </F>
Defense and Security Affairs Department operating under the 
Slovak Government Office, by Peter Sporer; place and date not 
given: "Armex Has Not Become an Alternative to Omnipol in 
Slovakia"] 
  [Text] [Sporer] The sale of weapons is often being written 
and spoken about only in allusions in Slovakia. What does a 
person think about this who, in his capacity as head of the 
government commission that awards licenses for the export and 
import of arms, should have a sufficient overview? 
  [Gerinec] Each businessman tries to find a buyer and, once 
he finds him, he tries to keep his name a secret because many 
possibilities exist to jeopardize a potential deal. The 
producer or seller, let alone the buyer, therefore prefers not 
to speak. I believe that it has been positive for Slovakia thus 
far that one was talking less in this regard, and doing more. 
  [Sporer] Doing? On the basis of the small amounts of spare 
parts produced in our arms factories (about 5 percent of the 
original production volume from the time before conversion) to 
which the factory managers admit, this "doing" could not involve 
large-scale deals? 
  [Gerinec] I agree. Besides, the sales have been restricted 
to excess equipment from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak 
Republic, and these sales are gradually coming to an end, owing 
to the available time frame, which is limited by international 
agreements. 
  [Sporer] The state used to sell heavy weapons manufactured 
in Slovakia through the Omnipol foreign trade company. This 
company was and still is represented by people who now live in 
the Czech Republic. These businessmen have contacts with 
specific countries and, within these countries, with specific 
customers. It is logical that, when an Arab client or another 
customer used to conclude agreements on deliveries with someone 
from Omnipol during a dinner, he will not turn to the prime 
minister or the arms factory director with an order today, but 
to the man with whom he once cooperated. Is the loss of Omnipol 
a big loss? 
  [Gerinec] It represents not only a loss but, literally, 
damage to Slovakia's interests. These people continue to work 
for the benefit of those who pay them; their priority is to 
conclude contracts for the benefit of their own 
organization--that is, Omnipol. They trade in arms manufactured 
in the Czech Republic, but, naturally, they also try to sell 
weapons manufactured elsewhere. Business is business. 
Naturally, they try to achieve the maximum financial profit for 
Omnipol, also vis-a-vis our factories, for example. We are 
trying to prevent this by means of the system we have created. 
Only a Slovak firm or juridical person can trade in arms 
commodities in Slovakia. 
  [Sporer] But cannot Omnipol still participate in business 
transactions as a middleman? 
  [Gerinec] It could do so only through a Slovak firm that 
would make the purchase for it. Omnipol could then sell the 
merchandise to a third party. 
  [Sporer] The most ideal solution would perhaps be to enlist 
people from Omnipol for a similar firm in Slovakia, or am I 
wrong? 
  [Gerinec] Omnipol is a well-established organization. The 
people working there have certain guarantees. Slovakia does not 
avail itself of a similar organization that would be established 
on world markets. Our businessmen who have acquired some 
reputation in this branch tried to enlist them, in a way. But 
the offer of something that could only be successful in the long 
run was too little, compared with the guarantees they now have. 
  [Sporer] How do you evaluate, from this viewpoint, the 
activity of Mr. Luhovy, for example, former minister of general 
engineering and, before that, director general of the ZTS [Heavy 
Engineering Works] economic production unit? 
  [Gerinec] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is involved in 
business while being retired. He lives in Slovakia and wanted 
to help Slovakia. 
  [Sporer] Was he rejected? 
  [Gerinec] No. Of course, the question is how such 
assistance can be realized. I do not know how Mr. Luhovy is 
doing. I am not in touch with him. 
  [Sporer] The Armex company was established in Slovakia 
almost seven months ago, as an alternative to Omnipol. The 
former government placed Vitazoslav Moric, honorary deputy 
chairman of the Slovak National Party, at the head of this 
company. Yet, to this day, Armex has not received a license 
from your commission.... 
  [Gerinec] It is difficult to comment on this issue because 
Armex has not yet applied for a license. It apparently had a 
reason not to apply. 
  [Sporer] What reason? 
  [Gerinec] The state retained 100-percent participation in 
Armex. An organization made up of representatives of five 
government departments was to be established, whose task was to 
take upon itself trade issues and also to coordinate these 
activities, if possible. The launching of Armex was linked to 
the launching of production in arms factories. The problem is 
that not even the basic prerequisites have been met--I am 
thinking, among other things, of the experience and initiative 
of the people involved--so this organization does not work. It 
was perhaps exaggerated to expect more of the state officials 
who were charged with this duty. 
  [Sporer] Is it within the government's jurisdiction to 
resort in Armex to personnel changes, for example? 
  [Gerinec] Of course. The government established the 
company, it appointed its director general, and it can even 
dissolve Armex. 
  [Sporer] How many companies trade in arms in Slovakia? 
  [Gerinec] This question is difficult to answer because it is 
a question of obtaining a permit [koncese] for sale, which is 
awarded by the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic. 
Once the ministry grants someone a permit to sell and purchase 
arms commodities, he can ask the government's licensing 
commission for a license to engage in this activity. However, 
there are private businessmen who sell weapons only on the 
territory of the Slovak Republic on the basis of a mere trade 
license. If they restrict their sales to the territory of the 
Slovak Republic, they need not be holders of a license from our 
commission. I emphasize, however, that those who export or 
import weapons must ask our commission for a license. Firms 
trading in short hunting weapons make use of this possibility 
most. However, a license can be requested even by a company 
that mostly trades in other commodities and wants to engage in 
arms trade as a supplementary activity. 
  [Sporer] People in the Martin and Dubnica arms factories 
claim that, after conversion, Poles rushed into the territories 
that have been vacated by Slovaks. Russians, too, are very 
active. Moreover, the Czechs have set up the RDP [Research, 
Development, Production] Group [holding of arms manufacturers] 
and try to assert themselves with a modernized T-72 tank. What 
chances are there for our heavy weaponry to return to its former 
markets? 
  [Gerinec] It is true that the Poles, who have not carried 
out any conversion, entered the vacated space. The Russians 
have not stopped developing tanks and have already mastered the 
production of tanks of the T-80 and T-90 ranges. Moreover, they 
own a great mass of excess weaponry [that they must discard to 
comply with international agreements]. It must be admitted that 
we have never manufactured any new models, but well-established 
models that we were able to "show," so to speak. That is also 
true of the T-72 tank. If we want to be successful, someone 
will therefore have to invest in development. 
  [Sporer] Which "someone"? 
  [Gerinec] A customer interested in the commencement of 
production. It is customary abroad that this task is assumed by 
the army of the country that owns arms production. The army 
replaces its equipment, and trade with other countries gradually 
receives a chance. The problem is that our Army's budget, no 
matter how high it may seem in comparison with the budgets of 
other government departments, simply does not allow the Army to 
supplement its arsenal with new weaponry. Therefore, the Army 
is not able to help set arms production in motion. It is a 
different matter, of course, when a factory starts an innovation 
program and reconstructs a tank turret, for example (which is 
the case at the Dubnica arms factory), and finds for it 
customers in armies equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the 
managers of these arms factories to calculate whether such deals 
are worthwhile. 
  [Sporer] There is talk about the state having lost tens of 
billions of korunas as a result of conversion. Plainly 
speaking, how can the arms factories cover this loss, in your 
opinion? 
  [Gerinec] Their managements are in the best position to 
answer this question. However, it would probably be 
inappropriate for me to reply only that the annual turnover of 
special production used to represent some 20 billion 
Czechoslovak korunas. People from the Martin factory cite a 
better example. They say that, when they produced and sold a 
single tank, they made the same profit they make from the 
production and sale of 40 tractors today.

  [Text] [Announcer] Answering a question about the 
possibility of the creation of a Balkan confederation, president 
of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said at today's 
news conference that every people should first enjoy freedom and 
independence in its own country and then think about a 
confederal connection with other peoples and countries according 
to reciprocal interests. At this news conference, president 
Rugova presented the very grave situation in Kosova, due to the 
continuous violence and repression of Serbia against the 
Albanians. For more details, Mehmet Haziri reports from 
Prishtina: 
  [Haziri] At today's meeting with reporters, president Rugova 
expressed his concern over the intensification of the Serbian 
repression against the Albanian population in Kosova, which was 
manifested during this week with raids on the pretext of 
searching for arms, maltreatments, violent recruitment of 
Albanian youngsters into the Serbian Army, raids on private 
firms, and convictions of Albanians in trumped-up trials. 
  The Serbian army and paramilitary forces are being more and 
more incorporated into this wave of police repression. 
  President Rugova condemned the application of violent 
measures of the installed Serbian power in the Dodona Children 
and Youth Theater in Prishtina, which has been developing an 
intensive cultural and artistic activity for a long time. 
  President Rugova said that the intensification of the 
Serbian 
violence and state terror aims at threatening and provoking the 
Albanian population. He also greeted the statement of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, who expressed sorrow over the status of 
Kosova, and that of Vice President Al Gore who highly assessed 
the peaceful resistance of Albanians, who were not provoked by 
the violence exerted on them. 
  Rugova hailed the statement of French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe, who warned that Kosova will be included in the package 
for the global solution of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
However, he attracted the attention that Kosova cannot be 
compared with the Knin province, as it had its own constitution 
as a federal unit of former Yugoslavia, ethnic territorial 
compactness, and the expressed political will of the people. 
  Even this time, president Rugova asked for international 
protection for Kosova. 
  Answering a reporter's question about Albania's diplomatic 
commitment and that of President Berisha toward the solution of 
the Kosova problem, Rugova pointed out that the common 
denominator of the diplomatic commitment of Kosova and Albania 
at the present moment is to prevent conflict in this area. 
  Commenting on some statements and articles in Serbian 
circles 
and media on the possibility of the creation of a new 
confederation in the Balkans, president Rugova said that the 
ideas for such confederations have yielded no results so far, 
and it is too early to talk about them. 
  First, ethnic problems should be solved in the Balkans -- 
everyone be placed in his own land -- and then discuss the 
possibility of any relationship of interest for all sides. The 
confederation cannot exist with the domination of one over the 
other, president Rugova said among other things at today's 
meeting with reporters.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina: "The `Dwarf's' Rocket Growth"] </F>
  [Text] Vaclav Benda [Christian Democratic Party founder and 
first chairman] probably never erred more than when, during the 
struggle for leadership of the Christian Democratic Party [KDS], 
he called Ivan Pilip a dwarf. Only four months after replacing 
Benda as party chairman, 30-year-old Ivan Pilip is the quite 
natural successor to outgoing Education Minister Pitha. 
  Vaclav Klaus will not be overjoyed at the resignation of the 
ill minister of education. While involving the prime minister 
in philosophical discourses, Petr Pitha, an admirer of [Czech 
linguist Vladimir] Smilauer and a Czech history buff, never 
disagreed with Klaus on government affairs. Pitha's hitherto 
deputy Pilip, on the other hand, has already clashed several 
times with the prime minister during debates on the education 
concept. And only a few minutes after his election as KDS 
chief, Pilip said about Vaclav Klaus: "I do not think that we 
have to make any radical concessions to him." 
  Being a realist, the prime minister realizes that he cannot 
deny Ivan Pilip any longer a place in the government, which the 
coalition owes the KDS since the times of the "unplaceable" 
Vaclav Benda. The prime minister even tried to seize the 
initiative and proposed to Pilip that he replace Frantisek Benda 
as minister of environment. The circumspect Pilip did not let 
himself be lured into the trap, however, and did not enter a 
field in which he is not well versed. 
  The two other chairmen of coalition parties, Jan Kalvoda and 
Josef Lux, hope that Ivan Pilip's taking up a ministerial post 
will reinforce them. The hitherto fairly successful deputy 
minister must, however, first come to terms with the role of 
minister and all the intricate problems of the education 
department. If any minister wants to take on the prime 
minister, even in the political arena, he must have done his 
"homework" first. Otherwise he ends up being disgraced, which 
would be even more true of a government greenhorn like Pilip. 
  Whether Pilip's coming to the government, connected with his 
greater media presence, will help the Christian Democrats is 
highly uncertain. For the time being, it seems that the 
ambitious chairman has a better chance of reviving the education 
Moloch than of reviving his slender party, which is plunging 
irresistibly into the depths of voters' oblivion.

<F P=106> [Article by sta: "Parliament Has Approved the Amendment to </F>
Law No. 143 on Pay and Emoluments"] 
  [Text] On the first day of its 16th session, the 
Chamber of Deputies of parliament (15 February 1994) approved an 
amendment to change and augment Law No. 143/1992 Collection of 
Laws [Sb.] on pay and emoluments for readiness to work in 
budgetary and some additional organizations, as specified in 
subsequent regulations. This law becomes effective on 1 April 
1994. 
  The following provision is among the most important changes 
based on the language of the amendment: Paragraph 4 of Section 
16 is eliminated. It said: "Pay is payable in the month in which 
the service relationship comes into being or continues." In 
practical terms, this meant that soldiers received their pay, 
for example, on 15 November for that entire month, their pay 
being thus "half ahead." The amendment changes this paragraph so 
that pay will be due in the future for the preceding month 
worked--that is to say, in practical terms, pay will be due in 
May for April. 
  An additional substantial modification is the introduction 
of 
the institution of so-called additional pay. This is nothing 
other than a 13th payday, or possibly even an additional payday. 
Inserted after Section 15 of the amendment is a new section, 
Section 15a, that states the following: "Additional pay--In 
fulfilling conditions stipulated by government regulations, 
employees are eligible for additional pay in a calendar year." 
The specific nature of applying this provision currently depends 
on the government regulation that is under preparation and that 
should be adopted in March. As we found out in the lobbies of 
parliament, in the Army there is supposed to be a 13th payday 
for which the sponsor of the amendment has stipulated two 
variations of the due date. One of the variations speaks of the 
halfway point in this year; a second talks about the halfway 
point in 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Vlastimil Stana: "As of April, Things Will Be </F>
Different"] 
  [Text] The amendment of the law that has to do with 
pay and emoluments for readiness to work in budgetary and some 
other organizations will specifically change the Army's internal 
implementing pay regulations. 
  The adopted amendment of the law is a reaction to experience 
gained in applying the law particularly in terms of making some 
provisions more specific because their language was subject to 
varying interpretations and their application in practical terms 
was connected with certain problems (for example, remuneration 
for overtime work and holiday work). At the same time, the 
amendment contains provisions allowing for the modification, 
through generally binding regulations, of the procedure to be 
adopted in regulating the amount of resources to be set aside 
for pay and emoluments in return for the readiness to work. 
<H5>  What Will Follow? </H5>
  The effective date of Law No. 143 is set for 1 April 1994. 
It 
is the basis for the creation of additional decisive documents, 
including government regulations and subsequently adopted 
internal pay regulations in the Defense Department. At the 
present time, finance components in the Ministry of Defense have 
processed the results of the markup proceedings to which the 
proposal for the government regulation was subjected. Any 
incidental changes will be processed by the Ministry of Labor 
and Social Affairs into the final text of the government 
regulation, which the government will approve in March. This 
document, stemming from the amendment to Law No. 143, will be 
the starting point for the adoption of new pay regulations in 
the Army. Among other things, these will include new tariff 
groups (pay categories). At the same time, a solution is found 
for the so-called overcoming of the transition period in April. 
<H5>  Innovations Pertaining to Extra Pay for Leadership </H5>
  Increases in the rates of extra pay for leadership are based 
on the desire to maintain the desirable relationship with 
respect to pay categories, the levels of which were raised 
during the previous era. This led to a narrowing of the relative 
differences in pay for rank-and-file and leading employees. What 
is essentially involved here is a better reward for leadership. 
Therefore, the employer must take into account, within the 
framework of better pay for leadership, any possible overtime 
work performed by the leading worker. A new provision also sets 
better pay for leadership in the case of employees who are not 
charged with being leaders but who are authorized to direct the 
work of other employees. This rewards the demanding nature of 
this kind of work, even at the lowest levels. 
  The amendment to the law also contains details of the span. 
If we disregard the leading employees of central organs of the 
state administration (for example, the minister and his 
deputies, department directors, etc.), the span is as follows: A 
leader who directs the work of subordinates (for example, unit 
commanders)--500-3,000 korunas [Kc]; a leading employee who 
directs several formations of an organization--Kc1,000-6,000; a 
deputy of a statutory organ--Kc2,000-9,000; a statutory 
organ--Kc3,000-13,000. An employee who is not a leader but who, 
according to the organizational chart, is authorized to 
organize, direct, and control the work of others is entitled to 
extra pay for leadership, depending on the demanding nature of 
such work, within the range of Kc330-1,500. The amount of extra 
pay for the employee is determined by the employer or by the 
individual who appointed the employee to his position or who 
assigned him to that position. 
<H5>  Overtime and Compensatory Leave </H5>
  Even this institution has been completely redefined. For an 
hour of overtime work, the employee is entitled to the portion 
of his monthly pay reflecting an hour of work, excluding 
overtime work, within the calendar month. The reward for 
overtime work takes the form of extra pay. The basis for 
computing this pay continues to be the average earning of the 
individual.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiri Stonawsky and Vlastimil Stana: "Soldiers To </F>
Receive April Pay on 13 May"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of March, directives issued 
by the deputy minister of defense and having to do with new due 
dates for pay in the Defense Department saw the light of day. We 
note that the new regulations impact on both career soldiers and 
civilian employees. What is involved here? 
  As we have already informed you in the previous issue of A 
REPORT, the amendment to Law No. 143/1992 Collection of Laws 
[Sb.] on pay and emoluments for readiness to work in budgetary 
and some other organizations, which was approved by the Chamber 
of Deputies of the parliament of the Czech Republic on 15 
February 1994, among other things eliminates Paragraph 4 of 
Section 16 of the law. Thus far, this paragraph had stipulated 
that pay for employees--members of the armed forces and security 
components and services in active employment--is due in the 
month in which the service relationship came into being or 
continues. As of the effective date of the amendment to Law No. 
143/1992 Sb.--that is to say, as of 1 April 1994--pay for these 
employees will be due after that monthly period. 
  According to this amendment, the procedure will be applied 
in 
practice for the first time by paying soldiers for the month of 
April 1994 on 13 May 1994 (under existing regulations, they 
would be paid on 15 April). 
  To realize the transition to the new due date for wages, 
Engineer Miroslav Kalousek, deputy minister of defense, has 
promulgated the following measures: 
<H5>  Deadlines for Paying Career Military Personnel </H5>
  Career military personnel who are normally paid by 15 April 
1994 and who file an application may receive a down payment for 
the month of April in accordance with the wages to which their 
last pay category entitles them. A condition for this down 
payment is an obligation (this is essentially a simple document 
that financial officers will have at their disposal) to repay 
this amount in a maximum of eight monthly payments so that it 
will have been fully accounted for, at the latest, at the time 
pay for the month of November is due--that is, by 15 December. 
The first payment will therefore be deducted as a matter of 
principle from the pay for April, which is due on 13 May 1994. 
When drawing pay for March 1994, a career soldier will file the 
appropriate application on the prescribed form, which will 
simultaneously serve as his obligation to make a specific number 
of regular monthly payments. This is essentially an agreement 
between the career soldier and his employer, covering the 
payment of the down payment and its repayment. 
  The agreement on specific repayments of the down payment can 
be fulfilled differently only in the following cases: 
  1. In the case of long-term illness and while drawing sick 
pay, the career soldier, recipient of the down payment, may, in 
justified cases, ask the appropriate commander to reduce the 
amount of the repayments or possibly to defer such repayments of 
the down payment. The decision by the commander regarding the 
reduction or deferral of the repayments shall be attached to the 
concluded agreement. 
  2. In the event a career soldier, recipient of the down 
payment, is discharged from active service before the repayments 
are made, the unrepaid remainder of the down payment will be 
accounted for, at the latest, by the time of his final pay or 
other monetary matters, entitlement for which arose before his 
discharge (for example, monetary compensation for equipment 
items, compensation for unused leave, etc.). If it is not 
possible to account for the unrepaid down payment even in this 
manner, the uncompensated remainder shall be deducted from the 
severance pay entitlement. 
  3. In the case of the death of the career soldier, recipient 
of the down payment, the unrefunded remainder of the down 
payment will be accounted for at the time of the final pay or 
other monetary matters to which the individual's estate is 
regularly entitled. If the accounting cannot be accomplished, 
the remainder of the down payment will be dealt with at the time 
of the inheritance proceedings. 
  The cumulative total of the remainder of down payments paid 
out shall be reported by the various formations via their 
superior HFU/OMP [expansion unknown] managing clerks, such 
reports always to be made by the 18th day of the month after pay 
has been accounted for, by calling the Prague military telephone 
number 45 721. 
<H5>  Deadlines for Pay for Civilian Employees </H5>
  In conjunction with the requirements of current practices, 
changes in pay for career military personnel are also 
accompanied by modifications of the deadlines for paying down 
payments and for the accounting of wages for civilian employees 
as follows: 
  1. In formations employing fewer than 250 employees, down 
payments by the 25th day of the month, accounting by the 10th 
day of the calendar month. 
  2. In formations employing more than 250 employees and in 
units having two or more pay locations, down payments by the 
27th day of the month, accounting by the 12th day of the 
calendar month. 
  The transition to these new pay deadlines shall be 
accomplished in such a manner that, beginning with the down 
payment in the month of April 1994, the deadline for paying out 
down payments and accounting for pay shall be advanced by one 
day each month.

<F P=106> [Article by Miloslav Frydl: "Three Schools To Remain"] </F>
  [Text] By 1 September 1994, the advanced military 
education system is supposed to be reduced. As of that date, 
however, three advanced military schools will remain. During the 
meeting of the Education Committee of the parliament of the 
Czech Republic, it was noted last week by the rector of the 
Advanced Military School for the Ground Forces at Vyskov, 
Lubomir Odehnal. 
  The idea of a unified defense university, about which we 
wrote in A REPORT two issues ago, is, according to L. Odehnal, 
by far not as topical now as it was several weeks ago. "It could 
be the final goal," noted the rector from Vyskov. "But work on 
the concept is in fact beginning from scratch. There will 
probably not be any specific changes in our orientation, but we 
shall be a lot wiser by the end of April." 
  L. Odehnal further stated that the last consultation with 
the 
minister resulted in a decision to move the deadline for 
transformation to 1 September 1995. But the definitive project 
for transforming military education must be submitted to the 
Education Committee of parliament by 30 April 1994, according to 
the resolution adopted last week by the deputies. "Everything 
that could have been said has already been said; now it is time 
to finally act," noted Kozel, chairman of the Education 
Committee. 
  We asked Jiri Pospisil, first deputy minister of defense, if 
the proposal to transform the advanced military education system 
is in such a state that it could be submitted to the Education 
Committee by the date specified. "Yes. There are a number of 
alternatives; discussions are continuing. I liked what the 
chairman of the committee said--it is time to submit some kind 
of results. It can be done by the deadline." 
  At the moment, Pospisil does not know whether the required 
proposal will contain the idea of a defense university. "I 
believe that it might be the case," he said in response to our 
question. "But, in my opinion, the basis for the transformation 
is a meaningful system, and it is essentially unimportant 
whether it will be divided into a single element or into three 
elements." 
  According to Pospisil, the final version of the proposed 
transformation of the military education system is to be 
submitted to the advisory board of the minister by the end of 
March. According to the Vyskov rector, the final language is 
expected to partially take into account the original proposal 
formulated by the commission of rectors of advanced military 
schools: "Some of the material will be utilized, some will be 
reworked. We will most likely not back down from adhering to 
advanced school principles. The toughest nut will be finding a 
common path for the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of 
Education, and the General Staff. The material to be presented 
to parliament by 30 April will contain a schedule for 
transformation, with a deadline for realization by 1 September 
1995. Much will depend on whether this schedule will be 
adopted," said L. Odehnal.

<F P=106> [Article by Vlastimil Stana on press conference given by </F>
Chief of General Staff Jiri Nekvasil: "Yesterday, Today, and 
Tomorrow--Some Facts on the Transformation of the Army of the 
Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] As announced by General Major Jiri Nekvasil, 
ACR [Army of the Czech Republic] chief of the General Staff, at 
a news conference, the Czech Army has undergone several waves of 
change over the past several months. The reorganization impacted 
not only on top organs of the Ministry of Defense but also was 
manifested particularly in military units and formations. 
  One of the features of change in the Army is undoubtedly the 
substantial movement of personnel, equipment, and all types of 
materiel. Only for purposes of illustration, last year some 
266,043 tons of materiel were transported within the framework 
of the Army. Even though the majority of this materiel was 
transported by highway, the Army also used 12,332 railroad cars. 
This year, the volume of materiel to be shipped will be 
approximately 177,500 tons of state property. 
  A specific element in the transformation is the 
disestablishment of military components. Since 1990, some 777 
formations and installations have been disestablished, with 132 
of them being eliminated just recently. Some 126 formations 
moved to other garrisons, and 187 new formations were created. 
  Just for last year, the reorganization impacted on a total 
of 
198 formations and installations of the Army. Military personnel 
left 28 garrisons, which represents the evacuation of 261 
facilities. This trend will continue in the coming months. 
  During the next two years, another seven garrisons will be 
disestablished. One of the problems that burdens the Army and 
exerts an influence in terms of the final consequences affecting 
training in some units is the fact that abandoned facilities 
continue to be guarded by the Army, although it does not utilize 
them. Virtually 400 facilities are being guarded by almost 2,000 
men. 
  A special chapter in the transformation is military 
aviation. 
According to official sources, the Air Force terminated regular 
flying activities at seven airfields since 1990; the Army is 
preparing to abandon an additional three airfields. 
  Unfortunately, pressure by representatives of some 
communities and municipalities continues to have military pilots 
evacuate their surroundings. Military aviation also has three 
air rescue centers under its wings. It is precisely the members 
of the Army who used this service to transport 5,500 persons in 
life-threatening situations last year; of these, 850 were in 
critical shape and 1,250 were children. 
  At the same time as the numerical strength of the military 
is 
declining (just last year the planned peacetime strength of the 
ACR was reduced by 12,923 individuals), the number of military 
training areas has also declined. The Army has thus permanently 
left the training areas at Mimon, Dobra Voda, and Mlada. 
  The reorganization has substantially impacted the area of 
military education and has had a basic impact upon civil 
defense, the military health-care service, and the military 
police. In March of this year, military railroad troops will be 
disestablished. 
  The personnel area continues to be one of the most closely 
monitored problems in the current Army; it has also been 
subjected to more than one change. But the search continues for 
a system to determine military careers; some reports indicate 
that there are several models for this but that they continue to 
stay under cover. Departures from Army ranks continue. Last 
year, some 6,594 individuals left the Army, including 113 
noncommissioned officers, 1,856 warrant officers, 4,607 
officers, and 18 generals. 
  On the other hand, 1,821 individuals joined the service in 
the ACR, including 438 noncommissioned officers, who joined the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] unit. At foreign schools, 117 
career soldiers are training, as of today, or have completed 
their training. 
  Gen. Nekvasil indicated that the most immediate 
reorganization would transform the central and western Army 
commands into the headquarters of the 1st and 2d Army Corps. An 
additional four combined-arms divisions will change into 
mechanized brigades. Air Force bases will be developed to house 
the 6th Air Force Transport Regiment and the 20th Air Force 
Bomber Regiment. The development of the rapid-deployment brigade 
is announced for April of this year. 
  In a more extended time frame, it is expected that 11 
territorial defense brigades and pontoon brigades will come into 
being. One motorized division, three infantry divisions, a 
chemical protection brigade, the headquarters of two divisions 
of air defense, and the headquarters of the 7th Civil Defense 
Recovery and Rescue Brigade will be completely disestablished. 
  All changes are to be accomplished by 1 October 1995. 
  The resulting status should then have the following 
structure: There would be a Ministry of Defense and a General 
Staff, followed by the headquarters of the 1st and 2d Army 
Corps, the headquarters of the 3d Corps of the Tactical Air 
Force and the 4th Air Defense Corps, the headquarters for 
logistics. The armed forces would be formed by: seven mechanized 
brigades, a rapid-deployment brigade, and 14 territorial defense 
brigades. Military aviation would operate six air bases.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Major Oldrich Barta, chief of </F>
logistics, Czech Republic Ministry of Defense, by Vladimir 
Marek; place and date not given: "A Small but High-Quality Army"] 
  [Text] The Army of the Czech Republic should be small 
and mobile and have modern equipment. We asked General Major 
Oldrich Barta, engineer, who heads the Main Office for Material 
and Technical Support at the Ministry of Defense, what lay 
behind this general statement. 
  [Marek] What kind of equipment will the Army of the Czech 
Republic require in the immediate future? 
  [Barta] The concept of equipping the Army of the Czech 
Republic was entrusted to the Department for Development of 
Equipment at the Ministry of Defense. It will not be possible to 
finalize the concept until all political interrelated questions 
are clarified. The equipping of our Army must be in line with 
even the latest facts, such as, for example, the Partnership for 
Peace. 
  [Marek] Nevertheless, it is reported that working out of 
that 
concept should not take longer than the fall of this year. 
  [Barta] We expect that by fall we could already have some 
data collected. I personally feel, however, that we will require 
more time to put together the entire concept. 
  [Marek] Under these conditions, how long will actual 
modernization take? 
  [Barta] It should be realized by the year 2005. Even some 
key 
programs have been planned with that date in mind. 
  [Marek] How much money will modernization require? 
  [Barta] At present, annual expenditures for the Army amount 
to 2.5 percent of the national income. We must unequivocally 
state that this amount of resources is inadequate. 
Modernization, particularly that of the Air Force and other 
technical components, is financially very demanding. But the 
answer to this highly complicated question must be sought not 
only at the specialized level but also at the economic and 
particularly the political levels. 
  [Marek] There are many discussions regarding the purposeful 
distribution of the military budget. Which part of it should be 
allocated to modernization? 
  [Barta] Of course, it would be desirable for it to be the 
largest percentage. In my view, it would involve about one-third 
of the budget. 
  [Marek] What will be the phases of modernization? What is 
considered to be a priority? 
  [Barta] The priorities have generally been identified. They 
involve systems of command and control so we could communicate 
with the NATO armies. Then there are the information systems, in 
both logistics and command structures. Next are the 
reconnaissance systems and, of course, the rapid-deployment 
brigade. For me to list those priorities in a more specific 
manner, I would have to base my statement on the defense 
strategy. And, for the time being, that has not been precisely 
outlined. 
  [Marek] Should that process be primarily shared by Czech 
armaments manufacturers, or are express purchases of weapon 
systems from abroad even being contemplated? 
  [Barta] I repeat once more: It is not a question of rearming 
but, rather, a question of modernization. For the present, we 
are not contemplating any new deliveries of weapon systems. We 
intend merely to modernize existing gear and equipment. If some 
new project has come to light, it is exclusively based on 
domestic production. 
  [Marek] Does that mean that the RDP Group, which is an 
association of Czech armament manufacturers, will have the green 
light with our Army? 
  [Barta] We have created certain principles for ourselves in 
terms of acquisitions activities. We are making contact with the 
RDP Group just like with every other entity. Of course, we 
perceive the RDP Group as a component of a specific Czech 
armaments industry. But that is all. 
  [Marek] I will ask the question more specifically: What hope 
for utilization in our Army is there, for example, for the 
Skoda-Plzen idea to modernize the T-72 tank? 
  [Barta] We told the RDP Group that we will not stand in its 
way in modernizing any kind of gear. We will be announcing 
requests for proposals, and, if the RDP Group comes up with a 
project that will be interesting for the Army of the Czech 
Republic, it will, of course, be realized. 
  [Marek] And what about, for example, the modernized 
modification of the Albatross? Are you figuring on it for our 
Air Force? 
  [Barta] The Albatross is a subsonic aircraft that is a 
training aircraft at present. Although a specific combat version 
is being considered, it would have to be augmented by the 
addition of at least more high-tech equipment--in other words, 
it would have to be made supersonic. 
  [Marek] Could you at least indicate what type of gear will 
have to be purchased from abroad in the immediate future--what 
will definitely be beyond the capabilities of our armaments 
industry? 
  [Barta] Because the army of 2005 has not been defined (but 
only that of 1995), it is very difficult to answer that 
question. But I think we certainly will not be manufacturing 
tanks. It is quite possible that we will not even need them. At 
present, I am unable to answer that question. We will certainly 
be buying some small numbers of materiel and equipment abroad, 
items domestic industry will not be producing. 
  [Marek] It is said that defense capability is not 
exclusively 
the Army's. It is said that it also involves the armaments 
industry. Is there not the threat, in the event of an actual 
conflict of some kind, that we would be cut off from possible 
service from abroad? 
  [Barta] Our Army will be small in numbers but will have 
high-quality equipment. The armaments industry will be smaller 
but of peak quality. It will certainly be made up of 
manufacturers of aviation systems and munitions. It will be an 
industry that will assure the stability of the Czech Republic 
and will exclude precisely what you have just defined. No 
country can afford to be dependent on the delivery of decisive 
spare parts and munitions from abroad. 
  [Marek] But our Army is predominantly equipped with former 
Soviet equipment. Are we not exposed to a certain risk, given 
the current instability in the territory of the CIS? 
  [Barta] Although our equipment is originally Soviet, it was 
manufactured predominantly by license, for the most part in 
Slovakia. At the present time, we have certain spare parts, 
certain stockpiles. We have nothing to fear in that direction. 
Moreover, the fabrication of some spare parts is possible even 
on the part of a non-Russian supplier. I have in mind, for 
example, Ukraine, Poland. 
  [Marek] How do you view the possibility of purchasing 
secondhand weapon systems from the U.S. Army? 
  [Barta] I personally believe that, at a time when we are 
downsizing the amount of gear and equipment, there is no reason 
to purchase used cheaper equipment. Even so, it is expensive for 
us, and, moreover, systems would have to be finalized to 
accommodate it. For example, the purchase of aircraft alone 
solves nothing in and of itself. You have to support the 
training system, you have to provide trainers, ground support, 
etc.

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Francikova: "The Grain Harvest Should Be </F>
Higher This Year"] 
  [Text] Total grain production this year is expected to 
amount to 7 million tons, which is approximately 400,000 tons 
more than last year, HOSPODARSKE NOVINY was told by Jan Stehlik, 
deputy minister of agriculture. According to current estimates, 
areas sown to grain crops have increased by 70,000 hectares, 
with the greatest expansion occurring in rye crops (increased by 
more than 20 percent). Winter wheat areas (also used for food 
purposes) have increased by approximately 2.6 percent over last 
year. The average yield of grain crops is being estimated at a 
level of 4.12 tons per hectare (as opposed to last year's 4.05 
tons per hectare), in view of the improved status of winter 
crops, compared with the comparable period of last year. The 
attainment of the anticipated volume of the harvest is also 
based on this year's better development of precipitation in the 
winter months. 
  Imports of grain crops last year amounted to a total of 
490,000 tons, which is approximately 350,000 tons more than was 
the case in the previous period, noted Stehlik. Exports 
(including transfers), on the other hand, declined from 493,000 
tons in 1992 to last year's figure of 45,800 tons. "The 
consequence of such low imports resulted in the overall decline 
in the use of grain crops in this country by almost 10 percent," 
the deputy minister stressed. Last year, in terms of overall 
consumption, reserves rose by approximately 288,000 tons--that 
is, approximately to a level of 20 percent. "We are thus 
reaching the optimum level--the low amount of reserves last year 
was virtually critical," added Stehlik.

was elected chairman, while Josip Manolic, Slavko Degoricija, 
Perica Juric, Tomislav Duka, and Dragutin Hlad were elected 
deputy chairmen. A news conference was held after the founding 
assembly. Jasminka Bogdanic reports: 
  [Bogdanic] At the news conference, Stjepan Mesic, chairman 
of 
the Croatian Independent Democrats, explained the reasons for 
forming this new party on the Croatian political scene and 
presented its guidelines. 
  [Begin Mesic recording] What we want to achieve by forming 
this party is for a law-governed state to function, for Croatia 
to join Europe's processes of integration, for our system to 
become compatible as soon as possible with developed European 
democratic systems and, finally, to correct what has been wrong 
in policy, which is the attitude toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now 
there are attempts to block the implementation of the Washington 
agreement. We want that agreement to be honored and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain a single country. [end recording] 
  [Bogdanic] Stjepan Mesic said that with respect to foreign 
policy, the HND will contact and cooperate with all European 
parties which have the word democratic in their names.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Croatian </F>
Independent Democrats, by unidentified studio announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Our guest this evening is Stipe 
Mesic, the newly elected chairman of the Croatian Independent 
Democrats [HND]. [passage omitted] 
  You addressed particularly sharp criticism at Croatian 
policy 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. You say that the policy was implemented 
by the wrong people and even by war criminals. Who have you 
been supporting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which people, and which 
policy? 
  [Mesic] In Bosnia-Herzegovina we support the survival of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are to 
choose who will represent them -- Croats and Muslims, and even 
Serbs who want Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We follow this logic: The disintegration of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would make possible the creation of a Greater 
Serbia. The Greater Serbia, strengthened by the so-called 
Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina, would never approve of 
the separation from Krajina and the areas they are currently 
holding in order for these areas to join Croatia. That would be 
practically impossible to do, and Croatia would be maimed. 
  The danger for Croatia would be enormous if a Greater Serbia 
were created. This is why we want the world to adhere to the 
principles it advocates, which means that borders must not be 
changed and that Serbia must return to its borders. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] You said that you will be oriented toward the 
future. In concrete terms, at the moment, how do you see the 
denouement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Mesic] Currently the greatest danger is coming from those 
who want to prevent the implementation of the Washington 
Agreement. They are very loud and they do not stop short from 
public appearances. One cannot help wondering what they are 
doing behind the scenes. They want to prevent the main thing -- 
the implementation of the Washington Agreement -- by erecting 
certain barriers, by insisting on some details. 
  [Announcer] Do you see the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina in a 
federation of Croats and Muslims? 
  [Mesic] Of course. If we start procrastinating now -- on 
whether a Croat will be the prime minister or the president of 
the republic; whether this or the other one will hold the 
position in the first year -- that is completely irrelevant if 
we want Bosnia-Herzegovina to survive. If it does not happen 
this year, it will happen next year. One year is a short time. 
If there is goodwill and a political decision, there will be no 
problem. However, those who favored a division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot implement the Washington Agreement, 
and this should be stressed. We are in favor of its 
implementation, which means that we must force them to implement 
it through our influence. 
  [Announcer] And, finally, what do you expect from the next 
session of the assembly? Will the HDZ [Croatian Democratic 
Union] have a majority? 
  [Mesic] [passage omitted] The balance of power in the 
assembly has now changed. The relations have changed. 
Specifically, the HSP [Croatian Party of Right] is not what it 
used to be and neither are IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly] and 
the HDZ. There is a new balance of power. We should sit down 
and make a gentleman's agreement. We must not consider each 
other enemies because we belong to different parties. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nada Al Issa from Zagreb] </F>
  [Excerpts] The founding assembly of the Croatian 
Independent Democrats [HND] was held in Zagreb today. The party 
was founded by Stjepan Mesic and Josip Manolic. [passage omitted] 
  Before the founding assembly, Mesic and Manolic sent an open 
letter to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman which was, 
surprisingly, published in Croatian newspapers. In the letter, 
Mesic and Manolic present their opinion about President Tudjman 
and his policy, and that opinion is the worst possible. Mesic 
and Manolic write: Mr. President, you rule as a dictator, 
leading the country to a catastrophe. After our warnings you 
call us putschists. 
  Let me remind you that the Hungarian Democratic Community 
[HDZ] accused Mesic and Manolic of preparing a coup while 
President Tudjman was in Washington. In their letter, Mesic and 
Manolic respond: We do not want to bring down the state but, Mr. 
President, we are against your disastrous policy both in Bosnia 
and in Croatia. According to Mesic and Manolic, all decisions in 
Croatia are made by one man and consequently the state president 
has to answer the following questions: Who is responsible for 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the war with the 
Muslims? Who sent the Croatian army to Bosnia only to deny its 
presence there? Its involvement in Bosnia has been confirmed by 
numerous coffins returning to Croatia, Mesic and Manolic say.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksa Crnjakovic: "Will `Turncoats' Cause a </F>
Crisis?"] 
  [Text] Although there are no big surprises regarding 
members of the future party, the making of the list of HDZ 
"turncoats" is the first-class political event for Croatian 
Independent Democrats [HND], for the members of the constituent 
circle of the future party is made up of as much as 16 deputies 
from the ruling party. Therefore, the most important question 
is will those turncoats, fronted by two presidents, of both the 
Chamber of Counties and Chamber of Representatives, cause a 
parliamentary crisis. There will be more and more people in 
suspense over the matter, for it is now President Franjo 
Tudjman's turn to make a move. Everybody is waiting to see what 
move he will make to prevent a major split in the party, but 
also major stirring in the Assembly. What steps will he take 
against those who "broke loose"? Is it more harmful for 
Croatian interests to eliminate two leading men from the 
Assembly than let them be and devote oneself to "being a mole"? 
<H5>  Do Moles Remain? </H5>
  Although politicians have lately been very much involved in 
some vague procedural regulations of some laws, with regard to a 
possible parliamentary crisis, the procedure is clear. First of 
all, a deputy can change parties and remain a deputy, for that 
right is granted by the Constitution. Deputies in the Assembly 
have no binding mandate, they cannot be revoked because of their 
political views or because they decided to accept another 
party's program and leave the party that brought them into the 
Assembly. Judging by the list of the Constituent Circle of 
Croatian Independent Democrats, with regard to the Chamber of 
Representatives, 13 HDZ members and one member of the Croatian 
Party of Rights will join the new party. In the Chamber of 
Counties, three HDZ members will join the new party. At 
present, the HDZ has 83 mandates in the Chamber of 
Representatives, without Father Tomislav Duka, who asked to 
leave the party, and without deputy attorney general (Lovric of 
Osijek is the president of the Trade Court, and that function is 
incompatible with the function as a deputy, but he cannot be 
released from his function as a deputy, for the State Tribunal 
has not been formed yet). 
<H5>  The "Duka" Case </H5>
  So, playing with numbers a little, we see that everything is 
possible, and that the outcome of the ballot is uncertain, 
although that does not necessarily mean that a parliamentary 
crisis is in the offing. It could just happen that, from now 
on, there will be more cases like the one at the last session 
when they could not make the decision to acquit Father Tomislav 
Duka of his membership in the Committee for Electing, 
Appointing, and Administrative Jobs. 
  Let me remind you: On that occasion, out of 79 deputies who 
voted, only 45 were in favor of putting the subject back on the 
agenda of the committee, five deputies abstained from voting, 
and only 29 voted to acquit Father Duka of his position as a 
member of the committee. As far as we can remember, this is one 
of those very rare occasions when the HDZ majority did not vote 
"by command." 
  There could be more such cases, even when voting for a 
single 
law, which means that the arguments of the opposition could also 
be the arguments of some members of the ruling party, now more 
than ever. A fierce battle is imminent, this time on the basis 
of quality, not quantity. 
  We should not take lightly the disorder created in the 
Committee for Electing, Appointing, and Administrative Jobs. 
Formerly a member of that committee, Father Duka has now joined 
future Croatian Independent Democrats, and HDZ deputies Ante 
Karic and Davorin Popovic are also on the list of the 
Constituent Circle for the establishment of the HND. 
Consequently, for the first time since deputies were elected, 
the committee was left without the HDZ majority. For, the 
committee has 11 members, seven of which were members of the 
HDZ, while now there are only four of them, which means that the 
HDZ can practically make no decisions! That is not 
insignificant considering the fact that this Committee proposes 
all dismissals and appointments, even that of the president of 
the Assembly. 

<H5>    Possibility of Secret Ballot </H5>
  And now we come to the most interesting question: Will the 
president of the country and the president of the ruling party 
dismiss Mesic and Manolic from their presidential functions and 
can he do that at all? The demand to replace the president of 
the Chamber can be made by 30 deputies, and it could also be 
done by the Committee for Electing, Appointing, and 
Administrative Jobs. Even if 30 deputies demanded the 
dismissal, the demand would have to be considered by the 
committee. The committee cannot stop the procedure of 
dismissing and appointing, for even in case of negative decision 
by the committee, there would have to be a ballot in the chamber. 
  Certainly, neither Manolic nor Mesic will resign from their 
presidential functions. Therefore, if it should so be decided, 
with regard to Mesic, the matter would be decided by a ballot in 
the Chamber of Representatives. The matter of acquittal will be 
put to the vote as it is usually done with regard to 
appointments. However, there might be a secret ballot in case 
there are two or more candidates. At the proposal of 10 
deputies, the Chamber can decide to put the matter to the vote 
if there is more than one candidate. If that should happen, we 
suppose that the "logistics" of the new party would be in favor 
of a secret ballot. 
  It is quite probable that both Mesic and Manolic would run 
again, and the Standing Orders specify they can do that if Mesic 
gets 30 and Manolic 20 signatures. In the present ratio of 
powers, that would not be difficult. The HDZ would put up their 
own candidate. In that case, it would be almost impossible to 
predict who could be a candidate for the president of the 
Chamber of Representatives. Perhaps again Zarko Domljan, the 
first president of the Assembly, presently vice president of the 
Chamber of Representatives? Or Katarina Fucek, perhaps? 
Considering the fact that Katica Ivanisevic would run for 
president of the Chamber of Counties, this would make a very 
interesting female cast! Who will win? The candidate who will 
get the majority vote, provided that most deputies are present, 
i.e., at least 70, in which case 36 votes will give him or her 
victory. If the session will be attended by all deputies, then 
it would take 70 votes to win. All deputies of all parties will, 
obviously, not miss such an occasion and, in that case, the 
ruling party would, of course, have to put up a candidate whom 
the opposition would find acceptable as well. 
<H5>  Conflicts in Working Bodies </H5>
  Still, the prevailing opinion is that the ruling party would 
get more if it left things the way they are than if it dismissed 
the presidents of both chambers. Clearly, the ruling party has 
an indisputable right to elect the president, i.e., presidents 
of both chambers, since it won the elections. However, it is 
very risky to eliminate both officials at once. It is debatable 
whether the two men would be more harmful as presidents or as 
two former key figures. 
  Anyhow, we think there will not be a real parliamentary 
crisis, but there will definitely be some changes in the 
Assembly. There will first be some conflicts in working bodies. 
It is very much possible that the HDZ will no longer have a 
majority in many of them. Committee members were elected 
observing the election results of certain parties and the HDZ 
has hitherto had about 65 percent of the mandate in every 
working body. Considering that the new party will soon be 
formed, this percentage would be lower, at the expense of the 
HDZ. For the first time, the HDZ will be forced to look for 
partners and form a coalition on certain issues. Where will it 
find them? There could be some absurd situations, indeed: 
Should it look for them in Djukic's Serbian National Party or in 
Djapic's HSP? And the wheel seems to be turning backward. Let 
us remember a discussion held last year on 15 October, during a 
three-day session of the Assembly, about taking the mandate of 
some HSP members. Djuro Perica was then the only HDZ member who 
defended the HSP members, and Minister Tarnaj, who was then a 
deputy, voted against taking away their immunity. 
  Will we witness another procedural competition, this time in 
the Chamber of Representatives? Can the procedure block the 
Assembly? At present, it seems that is all up to Mesic and 
Manolic and their will to convene sessions of those chambers. 

<H5>    While in the Standing Orders </H5>
  According to the Standing Orders, the presidents of the 
chambers convene sessions two times a month, as a rule. The rule 
has not been obeyed yet, which is evident from the number of 
sessions that were held: 17 sessions in the past 18 months. 
What happens if presidents do not convene sessions at regular 
intervals? Our Standing Orders do not contain such regulations 
as are included, for example, in the Standing Orders of the 
Austrian parliament, i.e., that it is possible to convene 
parliament within five days of filing a demand at the request of 
at least one-fifth of the deputies. 
  This regulation was deliberately excluded from our Standing 
Orders, for the opposition would have the one-fifth in both 
chambers without problems; in the Chamber of Counties the 
liberals alone make up the one-fifth, which means that the 
opposition could keep convening sessions, and some were 
obviously trying to avoid that. No one can convene a session but 
them and they practically have the possibility to block the work 
of the Assembly. However, supposing they do not opt for that, 
at least not for a very long time, if for no other reason than 
that they would not be true to the name of the party they are 
forming, i.e., that they are democrats and that they respect the 
procedure. 
  They will probably be convening sessions and work in favor 
of 
their party, asking the opposition to help. Perhaps they will 
refer to the changed ratio of powers, which gives them the right 
to keep their leading positions in the Assembly, which would not 
mean much in the division of power since the Government is made 
up of members of just one party. 
<H5>  Without "Fighting to the End" </H5>
  We can only hope that both turncoats and those who remain 
true to the ruling party are equally set to work for the 
prosperity of Croatia, and that they will not, in their 
political struggle, "fight to the end," but that they will try 
to act as true members of the Assembly, advocating the rule of 
the law and parliamentary ways of fighting. In the leadership of 
the Assembly, the ratio of powers is now 2:2, if we consider 
presidents and vice presidents. Let us hope the change in the 
ratio of powers will not influence the internal political 
stability of Croatia. 
  That is not in the interest of international factors either, 
which Mate Granic made clear both at the meeting of the HDZ Club 
and at the session of the VONS [Council for Defense and National 
Security]. If it should, however, come to serious disturbance in 
balance, both sides are to blame, both those who stayed and the 
runaways. That will be an opportunity for the opposition, 
although it is questionable whether they will know how to make 
use of it. Here is a good side of this imbalance: There have 
been problems with a quorum for a while. But now it seems 
everybody will come to help "their side." If they do not get 
out of control, these could be very interesting sessions, 
although we can still not expect to have the British unwritten 
rule according to which some Labor Party members leave the 
session if too many members of the Conservative Party show up 
that day, thus disturbing the standard electoral ratio of powers.

  [Text] Belgrade, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- The foreign affairs 
ministry of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] sent a letter 
today to the diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade 
warning of the terror by the Croatian over the Serb population, 
calling on them to raise this issue at the United Nations and to 
do everything to prevent these crimes in Croatia from being 
hushed up. 
  The letter mentions a statement by Stipe Mesic, the speaker 
of the Croatian Assembly, about the killing of the Serb Zec 
family (Mihajlo, Mirjana, and their 12-year-old daughter, 
Aleksandra) in Zagreb in 1991. In his statement, which was 
published in the FERAL TRIBUNE weekly in Split, the letter goes 
on to say, Mesic said that members of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry of the Republic of Croatia were suspected of having 
killed the Zec family, but were acquitted at a secret trial in 
Zagreb. 
  This statement by Mesic is a confirmation of the terror by 
the Croatian state over the Serb population between 1991 and 
1994, the letter stresses, calling on the consular and 
diplomatic missions in Belgrade to propose to their governments 
that his issue be raised in the UN bodies. 
  The letter says that over 300,000 Serbs were evicted from 
Croatia, which is the largest-scale and the first ethnic 
cleansing carried out in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The letter also notes that approximately 14,000 Serbs, 
including complete families, were killed by the Internal Affairs 
Ministry of the Republic of Croatia. The UN Security Council 
Commission for War Crimes, the letter goes on to say, was 
informed about 87 mass graves in Croatia, where the 14,000 
innocent members of the Serb nation are buried. 
  "Unfortunately, the Security Council has decided that this 
commission should cease work on 30 April 1994 (allegedly because 
of a lack of money), even though nothing has been done about the 
exhumation of these 87 graves, the identification of victims, 
and the handing over of the perpetrators to the International 
War Crimes Court," the letter says, making the appeal: "Please 
do everything to prevent these crimes in Croatia from being 
hushed up."

  [Text] We have just received a statement from the 42d 
session of the Presidential Council for Defense and National 
Security. The council discussed the recent strikes. 
  Discussing the strike of the workers in the budget-financed 
sector, the Presidential Council for Defense and National 
Security established that there are problems -- to a large 
extent inherited -- but that more effective action should be 
taken to solve them. The council stresses that the government 
has already prepared and proposed solutions, which should be 
implemented as soon as possible because, for example, there is 
an agreement that grades in the salaries of budget workers are 
uneven and set without a regular pattern. 
  The council stresses that the Croatian Government and the 
trade unions have no other aim or purpose than solving the basic 
problems of the workers and all Croatian citizens, and trying to 
find the best possible solution to the problem, as permitted by 
the level of production. Better organized trade unions could 
also contribute to this by better and more clearly defining the 
specific problems and interests of different groups of workers. 
  The council believes that we are currently at a very 
sensitive stage of the implementation of the stabilization 
program, and that renouncing financial discipline and 
interfering with the budget would destroy the stabilization 
program. 
  In connection with this, despite opposition, it will be 
necessary to discontinue further financing of permanently 
loss-making enterprises, because of our commitment to a market 
and not a planned economy. We are aware of the fact that in 
certain instances this will cause turmoil. However, this is 
necessary in order to establish an overall healthy economic 
system. It should be stressed that the processes of economic 
rehabilitation or bankruptcy are in fact the processes of 
healing and recovery which ultimately lead to the creation of 
new production and employment, which are the only things that 
can improve the standard of living. 
  It was reiterated that Croatia as a welfare state would 
secure full social benefits to all those who face difficulties 
in these processes. The council praised the government for the 
results it has achieved with its economic policy so far and 
concluded that work of this kind by the government was a 
precondition for receiving comprehensive international financial 
aid, which will contribute considerably to the overall economic 
revival of Croatia. 
  International circumstances are increasingly favorable -- 
something best illustrated by the improvement of relations with 
the United States, which has offered a draft agreement on 
cooperation in the spheres of the economy, technology, and other 
areas, which, in the light of statements by top U.S. officials, 
shows that the United States is ready to develop a partnership 
with the Republic of Croatia in all areas. 
  The council is aware of the financial situation in all 
sectors of Croatian society, both in industry and in the 
budget-financed sector, but warns that many people wish to use 
the accumulated social discontent for the political 
destabilization of Croatia. 
  The council wishes to praise the prime minister, who was 
personally involved in the resolution of all these problems. The 
council stresses and supports the government's position that the 
budget endorsed by the assembly in the form of a law cannot be 
increased before the volume of overall production increases, and 
that a new allocation of resources from the budget for salaries 
through different grades can be negotiated by all budget 
beneficiaries, and a decision on this can be taken by the 
assembly and the government; this should never be a cause for 
petty politics and often demagogic pressures. 
  A precondition for international financial aid is a stable 
political situation. For that reason the council calls on 
everyone to take into account the overall interests of the 
Croatian state. The council calls on everyone to discuss all 
problems in a peaceful atmosphere, and patiently and responsibly 
create conditions for a speedier economic recovery, and thus for 
the overall progress of our country and each individual.

<F P=106> [Report by Sokol Balla in Sofia] </F>
  [Text] After the visit to the Bulgarian National 
Historical Museum here in Sofia, an important topic on the third 
day of the official visit of our President Sali Berisha was the 
joint news conference with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  In his statement Bulgarian President Zhelev pointed out the 
quiet road without excesses of the performance of the reforms in 
our country. He also stressed that Albania plays a key role in 
peace, stability, and security in the Balkans. To defend his 
idea, he brought up two arguments: first, the fact that ethnic 
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosova, and 
the presence of the Albanians who live in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Nevertheless, 
President Zhelev said, these two acute problems and sore points 
are handled with a sound logic, prudence, and political maturity 
by the Albanian state and its chairman, Mr. Berisha. 
  Zhelev said that while in 1991 Albanians came to take our 
experience, now in 1994, on the contrary, we are the ones who 
should go and see how the economic and political reforms are 
carried out in Albania. 
  Concerning the refusal of the Bulgarian party to participate 
in a trilateral meeting proposed by Greece, President Zhelev 
stressed that peace and stability in the Balkans are reached and 
preserved with the contribution of all Balkan countries. 
However, Zhelev stressed, it is not good for two or three sides 
to meet and talk behind others' backs. The time has gone when 
discussions were held and decisions were made by isolating the 
third parties. At present the dialogue is open to any country 
interested in the stability of the region. The chairman of the 
Albanian state later took the floor. 
  [Begin Berisha recording] First, I want to thank President 
Zhelev from my heart for the warm and friendly reception and 
express my greatest pleasure for the level of relations between 
Albania and Bulgaria. Our two countries have old friendly and 
historic ties. However, I wanted to say that their determination 
to develop and strengthen their ties, cooperation, and 
friendship at the present time is the most important. 
  In this respect, both countries, who suffered the communist 
dictatorship together and which were engaged in the course of 
the reform, are undoubtedly more sensitive to pain and 
sufferings, due both to their past and the course of the 
reforms; they have a broader meaning for each other. These are 
the reasons that in two years, Albania and Bulgaria have signed 
dozens of agreements and have established very good political 
and economic cooperation. What is the most important is the fact 
that the two countries are fighting and actively trying to 
achieve peace and stability in the Balkans. I think that our 
two countries have played an important role in reducing tension 
and preserving peace in the south of the Balkans. 
  Once again, I avail myself of the opportunity in front of 
you 
to confirm the great importance of President Zhelev's refusal to 
participate in the trilateral summit proposed by the Greek 
former prime minister for the Balkans. The Greek prime minister 
aimed at placing the Balkans before a religious dangerous 
alliance. 
  I think that the friendly relations between Albania and 
Bulgaria will show how states with various beliefs but with the 
same principles can cooperate to the benefit of each other and 
the region. 
  During these two days, in the course of my discussions with 
President Zhelev, the chairman of the parliament, and Prime 
Minister Berov, we discovered with pleasure that there exists a 
great desire to develop economic cooperation. We are asking for 
help from the European Union so that this cooperation becomes 
more fruitful. Thus, our two countries -- and I hope other 
countries in the Balkans -- are waiting to profit by the ideas 
of the white paper of President Delors. The extension of these 
principles of this white paper into the Balkans, which means an 
implementation of the East-West corridor and other branches, not 
only brings these countries closer to each other but brings our 
whole peninsula closer to Europe. 
  We are very worried about the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Zhelev and I think that only 
strong action by NATO and a coordination of the cooperation of 
the United States, the European Union, and Russia will be able 
to bring an end to the crisis. 
  We also consider very important the stability of the 
Republic 
of Macedonia. Both our countries have recognized and offered 
with pleasure that modest resource they have in the cooperation. 
However, we think that the Republic of Macedonia should expand 
and guarantee the freedoms and human and national rights of 
Albanians as a condition for its stability. 
  The situation in Kosova is very grave. Ladies and gentlemen, 
today, when apartheid has disappeared from the world corners, it 
is in power in the cradle of the present Western civilization. 
I mean here the territories of the Balkans -- it is in Kosova. 
I can say that without the solution of this problem, there does 
not exist and cannot be a solution to the Balkan crisis. As 
long as the Albanians do not demand the change of borders 
through force, i.e., they respect one of the two most 
fundamental principles of the Helsinki Charter, the other one 
included as well, I think that this problem should be assessed 
as soon as possible. On the contrary, Milosevic will implement 
in Kosova the application of the memorandum of the Academy of 
Sciences of Serbia which, as you know, implies the creation of 
Greater Serbia through force by exterminating and cleansing 40 
percent of the non-Serbian population that lives in these areas. 
  We discussed with President Zhelev a series of agreements in 
the future. Albania and Bulgaria think that not separate 
alliances, but bilateral and multilateral cooperation, is what 
will be able to take our region out of the crisis and favor the 
integration processes over those of confrontation. 
  At the same time, I want to clarify the presence of Turkish 
troops in Bosnia. Turkey gave a real and concrete contribution 
in the understanding between Croats and Muslims. I have 
considered and still consider very important the agreement that 
both sides who fought against each other signed to interrupt the 
war. I am convinced that if the Serbs sign this agreement, this 
will be the road of establishing peace and stability there. 
  Mr. President, in closing I want to convey to all Bulgarians 
my best wishes on the Easter holiday. [end recording] 
  After the news conference, the ceremony for the departure of 
President Berisha, his wife, and the delegation accompanying him 
was held in front of the presidential seat, where the welcoming 
ceremony was also held. President Zhelev, his wife, and the 
Bulgarian delegation attended the ceremony. The Albanian 
delegation then returned home.

  [Text] The Hungarian and Slovak prime ministers have met in 
Komarom. As planned originally, no agreement has been signed at 
the talks between Peter Boross and Jozef Moravcik. However, the 
two discussed the situation of the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia, the Boes [Gabcikovo] Dam, the elimination of double 
taxation, and the opening of new border crossing points. 
  At the joint news conference it was said that the greatest 
achievement of these Hungarian-Slovak prime ministerial talks is 
that a new phase will begin in bilateral relations. The meeting 
made possible the settlement of the disputed issues at a later 
stage, it was said at the press briefing.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 30 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] protested Saturday to Bosnian Serb authorities over 
an attack on British UN troops on foot patrol inside a 
NATO-imposed exclusion zone in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. A 
patrol came under fire Friday [29 April] at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) 
in the east of the zone from Serb forces which were themselves 
within the three-kilometre (two-mile) limit imposed by the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation on April 22, UNPROFOR spokesman 
Eric Chaperon said. The British forces had taken no casualties. 
They had riposted, and the Serbs were believed to have taken 
three casualties in what Chaperon described as a violation of 
the NATO ultimatum in the eastern town of some 65,000 residents. 
  Under the NATO deadline, all Serb heavy weaponry was to be 
withdrawn from a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius around Gorazde, 
and troops pulled out from the inner exclusion zone, by 0001 GMT 
Wednesday. No further details were immediately available on 
Friday's incident.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 1 May (TANJUG) -- The main headquarters of 
the republic of Srpska army today announced that on 30 April UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] took part -- together with Muslim 
units -- in an attack on Serbian positions in the Tuzla region. 
A statement says that two armored vehicle platoons of the 
Nordic battalion were involved in the attack in which nine 
people were killed and five wounded on the Serbian side. 
  The main headquarters has received reports that Nordic 
officers received 500,000 German marks for the UNPROFOR 
armored-mechanized and artillery support for Muslim infantry. 
  The statement, issued today by Chief of Staff Manojlo 
Milovanovic on behalf of the main headquarters, reads: 
  On 30 April UNPROFOR launched their first ground assault on 
positions of the Srpska republic army and Serb territory in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Early yesterday morning the Muslim 
forces launched a strong, well-organized artillery and infantry 
attack from the demarcation lines around Kalesija, Kladanj, and 
Olovo, in the Tuzla area. The attack on Vis hill, the Srpska 
republic army's closest position to Tuzla airport, was 
particularly strong, with the objective of provoking a heavy 
Serb response against the airport, which would then be used to 
force NATO into issuing an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw 
their heavy weapons to 20 km from Tuzla and Dubrave airport. 
  Two armored vehicles from the Nordic battalion deployed in 
the Tuzla area also took part in the attack against the Serbian 
positions and territory. Colonel Bosne himself, the deputy 
UNPROFOR chief of staff for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, has 
admitted that this unit fired 74 shells. We have found out that 
the Muslims have paid 500,000 German marks to one of the Nordic 
battalion commanders for support for the Muslim infantry by 
UNPROFOR armored vehicles and artillery units. They paid 5,000 
German marks for each armored vehicle that took part in the 
attack and 1,000 marks for each artillery shell fired. According 
to unofficial reports, UNPROFOR is currently investigating the 
involvement of its ground forces in the Muslim offensive. 
  The following are the names of the casualties caused by the 
first ground attack by UNPROFOR against the Serbian positions, 
in which armoured vehicles and Leopard tanks were used: Milic 
Mara (1927), Radivojevic Ruza (1950), Krstic Mira (1976), Stupar 
Ljubisa (1955), Radojcic Ljubisa (1968), Petrovic Zoran (1963), 
Zepinic Milisav (1954), Vukovic Zoran (1964), and Brkic Branko 
(1948). Milic Danica, Radivojevic Djoko, Todic Mirko, Tripic 
Milko, and Pavic Dragan were wounded. 
  This UNPROFOR attack is the best confirmation that the 
authorities and the army of the republic of Srpska were 
justified when they earlier opposed the deployment of tanks and 
other heavy offensive weapons in the Tuzla area. At the same 
time, this is a proof of open and biased involvement of the UN 
peace forces on the Muslim side. This casts serious doubt on 
their peace mission and, objectively speaking, will lead to the 
internationalization of the war in this region. 
  Under the international law on warfare, the republic of 
Srpska army has the right to return fire on the attacker's 
forces, regardless of where their positions are. However, the 
republic of Srpska army will not respond on this occasion, in 
the belief that UNPROFOR's attack is the action of an 
irresponsible officer who is probably involved in the 
above-mentioned money deals with the Muslims, the statement says.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Karl-Peter Schwarz; place and date not given: "Closing Down 
Bohunice Is Just a Matter of Time"] 
  [Text] [Schwarz] Mr. Prime Minister, for two years you 
were a minister in Meciar's government, and now you are heading 
the new government. What is the actual difference between the 
new and the former Slovak Government? 
  [Moravcik] We continue what was positive--namely, the 
transformation of our economy, and we want to implement that as 
quickly and as consistently as possible. The previous 
government also had to put its relations with the IMF in order, 
and we want to do that, too. However, the precondition for that 
is that the budget deficit be not more than 4 percent of the 
GDP. Last year it was 7 percent. The former government also 
declared speedy privatization as one of its goals. In reality, 
however, it slowed down the privatization process. We want to 
accelerate it and, at the same time, depoliticize it. 
  [Schwarz] In your government, very different forces are 
represented, that are bound together by their opposition to 
Vladimir Meciar. Can such a coalition last beyond the elections? 
  [Moravcik] I believe so. However, for this purpose, we need 
an election result that enables us to continue our work. The 
precondition for lasting political stability is stability of the 
political parties, and these parties, for their part, must 
correspond to the large political parties in Europe. The 
cooperation of the parties plays a very important role at the 
European level. In our coalition, we have such parties: a 
leftist party, a rightist party, and one party of the liberal 
center. Rightist-leftist coalitions are nothing unusual. In 
Austria this is working very well. 
  [Schwartz] At the moment, former Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar is more popular than ever. His ouster was obviously 
either too early or too late.... 
  [Moravcik] The problem is the date of the new elections. We 
wanted to postpone the elections for a few months, until spring 
1995. By then the government would have had more opportunity to 
present itself to the voters as a viable alternative. It looks 
as if the elections in the fall will not change much about the 
structures in parliament. The problems will remain. 
  [Schwarz] Meciar's HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] 
obviously fears that you might drag out the election period. 
  [Moravcik] The election period--30 September-1 October--is 
definite. We have no intention of changing it, even though 
developments so far have confirmed our opinion about a later 
election date. The ouster has given Meciar sympathy. But, when 
the government ensures a calm and busy atmosphere, which the 
people want, it will convince the voters. 
  [Schwarz] After the elections, too, your government would 
need the support of the parties of the Hungarian minority. 
  [Moravcik] Yes, this is very likely. The opposition is 
using this against us. However, we need a rational relationship 
with the minority parties to be able to solve the minority 
problem. 
  [Schwartz] Do you expect that after the elections in Hungary 
it will be easier to defuse the smoldering conflict with 
Budapest over that? 
  [Moravcik] We have the political will to improve relations, 
and this is in our mutual interest. After all, both countries 
want to join the European Union as quickly as possible. We 
cannot afford the conflict. 
  [Schwarz] Can you adopt the Hungarian position that the 
minority issue involves not only individual rights but also 
collective ones? 
  [Moravcik] We do not think that territorial autonomy would 
be good for the Hungarian minority. On the contrary, it would 
create unrest. 
  [Schwarz] Relations with Austria are attributed particular 
importance in your government program, in particular with regard 
to Austria's forthcoming accession to the European Union. 
However, they are overshadowed by the quarrel over [the nuclear 
power plants of] Bohunice and Mochovce. What is your position 
on nuclear energy? 
  [Moravcik] We would be vary happy if we could free ourselves 
of the burden of the Bohunice nuclear power plant. For us, this 
is primarily an economic problem. Bohunice produces a lot of 
energy, which we need, and we cannot afford changing to another 
fuel. The government has not yet closed this issue and is still 
looking for the best possible solution. I am convinced that we 
will find it. 
  Closing down Bohunice is only a matter of time. For 
Mochovce, we want to choose a partner that can guarantee enough 
safety.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Milica Ostojic-Pusara; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ostojic-Pusara] Good evening, esteemed viewers. 
We know that several days ago the so-called contact group for 
Bosnia was formed, consisting of representatives of the United 
States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. 
After the first meeting that was held in London, this group 
will try -- if we understood it correctly -- to regain the 
dynamics of the peace process on the ground, of course, with the 
involvement of the warring sides. 
  Is this the path toward peace in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and what does the involvement of this 
contact group mean in practice for the FRY? This evening we are 
asking FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic about these 
issues. 
  [Jovanovic] Every shift toward peace certainly represents an 
alternative to the worst that had been our everyday life until a 
few days ago, especially in the Gorazde region. In this sense 
the contact group with the plan of contacts that it will have in 
the period ahead is in a way contributing to the recovery of the 
atmosphere and the creation of the necessary preconditions for 
the renewal and strengthening of the negotiating process. 
  However, what is more important than the instruments 
themselves, than the structure of negotiations, which also 
include the contact group, should be the refreshing of the 
approach to the Yugoslav crisis. The approach hitherto, the 
one-sided, partial, selective approach, not only has it been 
unjust, but it also became to a great extent the generator of 
the crisis itself. 
  This was the case during the denouement of the latest 
developments, when we saw the demonstration of partiality, which 
was prevented at the last moment from resulting in an 
escalation, an even worse situation. Therefore, now that we are 
at the fresh start of renewing the negotiating process, everyone 
should make a sufficient self-critical review and everyone 
should on his part try to remove from his way of thinking, his 
approach, and from his stands everything that has so far been 
hindering the negotiating process, leading to its failure. As 
for the foreign factors that have so far been involved in 
solving or not solving the Yugoslav crisis -- depending on their 
individual attitude -- there are certainly very serious and very 
sound reasons for everyone to carry out the necessary revision 
of the current approach to the crisis, and to introduce in these 
approaches and stands the necessary corrections. If this does 
not happen we would run the risk of the negotiating process not 
only being unnecessarily prolonged and perhaps being made more 
complicated, but also something worse, namely instead of being 
food for peace, the process would become food for maintaining 
the crisis and even renewing the military conflicts. 
  I say this because one side, at least one side in this civil 
war, the Muslim side, will always find a reason to believe, to 
be encouraged, or to be under the illusion that -- by further 
complicating the procedure of negotiating, and occasionally 
resorting to combat activities -- it will gain more than through 
the negotiations. The negotiating process has, thus far, been 
burdened by this very negative factor, and all our warnings that 
the inequitable approach of the leading components creates not 
only an inequitable final result but also makes it impossible 
for the negotiating momentum to follow its logical course toward 
a prompt conclusion. [sentence as heard] 
  We would like to see the contact group adopt, in the new 
cycle of involvement, a fresh approach and cleansed views when 
it comes to the question of how to get out of this crisis, and 
how to make all the elements, the three warring sides, equally 
responsible for the negotiating efforts and the final result. 
In that sense we are ready to be as active, open, and 
constructive as always, when it comes to solving the Bosnian 
crisis, with the contact group and the other participants in the 
negotiating process, which will most probably be resumed. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] As has happened before, it is possible that 
one of the warring sides -- and I am referring to the Muslims 
here -- will ask for some kind of a retreat. We have been 
reading recently that Mr. Izetbegovic, leader of the Bosnian 
Muslims, has asked, that is, has sent a letter to the king of 
Saudi Arabia, asking for the Organization of Islamic Conference 
to be the fifth and equal member of the contact group. 
  [Jovanovic] This is one of the continuous efforts of the 
Muslim leadership to complicate the procedure, making the 
negotiating process more complex, and helping those elements in 
the process whose natural interests are not in ending this 
crisis as soon as possible, but rather in gaining maximum 
advantage from it. The advantage is not equal for all the 
participants in the war or the peoples of the Balkans in 
comparison to the advantage that the non-Balkan factors -- not 
all but some -- expect to gain from this crisis. 
  We know that the Islamic bloc of countries is fully engaged 
in a very biased, one-sided, and aggressively provocative way. 
Everything they have undertaken so far has been aimed at 
deepening antagonism between the warring sides, and not at 
narrowing their differences. Everything has been done to 
facilitate the creation of conditions for the 
internationalization of the military conflict, for unimpeded 
outside involvement with impunity. The participation of Saudi 
Arabia -- which, by the way, does not have diplomatic relations 
with any other country except Muslim Bosnia -- could not be 
interpreted as a constructive contribution to efforts made by 
the contact group and other countries that are positively 
oriented toward peace, for the revival of the negotiating 
process. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] It seems that this is, according to you -- 
and I suppose also the federal government -- a path toward 
peace. There is talk now of a four-month cease-fire. Do you 
believe that it would be possible within that period of time to 
come to an overall peace solution, if the favoritism is 
eliminated, of course? 
  [Jovanovic] It would be best to put a final complete stop to 
that unfortunate war, and -- with the feeling of safety that the 
war will not deepen or be renewed -- to make relaxed but rapid 
efforts to find a final just and lasting political solution. 
That is the view of the FRY and the Bosnian Serbs. That is 
also the view of many other participants in the negotiating 
process. However, the view of the Muslim leadership is 
different. They want to have a fixed-term cease-fire, which is 
reason enough for one to wonder why they are doing this. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] Anything can happen in that time, right? 
  [Jovanovic] First of all, they are doing this because they 
want to keep the option of renewing and extending the war. 
Second, it is possible that they see this cease-fire as a lull 
for arming and new provocations for renewing the war from even 
better starting positions. It is also possible that they are 
doing this in the expectation that they can materialize the 
support that they are getting from their friends from abroad, 
that they can turn this support into victory for themselves. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] This could then be a preparation for war, 
rather than a preparation for peace. 
  [Jovanovic] It could be a preparation for the continuation 
of the political war, or part of the preparation for the 
continuation of the armed conflict. In any case, the fact that 
Saudi Arabia is singled out indicates that the Muslim leadership 
could use this period of relative peace to turn to escalating 
political pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, and on 
the Serbian people in general, which would have a negative 
effect on the negotiating atmosphere and perhaps even affect the 
final outcome. 
  In any case, in the absence of the best solution, even the 
not-so-good solution is better than no solution at all. 
Therefore, even though the cease-fire would be a fixed-term 
cease-fire, that in itself would not represent the failure of 
the peace efforts if it is accompanied by a sufficient number of 
guarantees given by relevant international bodies that this 
period would not be abused for the preparation for war, or that 
it would not be used as an opportunity to obstruct the 
negotiating process. 
  These are things that can be negotiated, and -- without 
wishing to prejudice the stand that the leadership of the 
Bosnian Serbs will take on this issue -- I think that this is 
not a question that can be put down as unsolvable. On the 
contrary. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] In your view, is it clear what actual means 
this group has available to reach peace? How likely are abuses 
here? 
  [Jovanovic] The contact group.... 
  [Ostojic-Pusara, interruptsing It proposes things that will 
later go to the conference.... 
  [Jovanovic, interrupting] It first has to revive the 
contacts that were severed or frozen due to the escalation in 
tensions, and to create conditions for the start of the real 
negotiating process in which the warring sides will -- with the 
help of peace-loving countries from elsewhere -- try this time, 
I hope successfully, to agree on a final political solution. It 
is hard to predict what this solution will be like. It will 
come as a result from the contacts and the first stages of the 
negotiating process. 
  The basic question is whether all the participants in the 
process have an equal desire for peace, whether someone still 
has a desire for war, and whether the foreign participants are 
all equally interested in reaching peace quickly and in a way 
that is equal for all. The establishment of equality in the 
treatment of the participants in the peace process is something 
that is implied. So far there has been no equality because one 
side, the Serbian side, has constantly been in an inferior 
position. It was under multiple pressure, media pressure, 
economic pressure through the sanctions, and political pressure 
through isolation and satanization. These things cannot be a 
contribution to the negotiating process, but rather, on the 
contrary, they serve as a warning that this imbalance must be 
urgently removed in order to make the process a real 
conversation among equals. Then the result of the talks can be 
based on consensus and freely expressed will. 
  Therefore, parallel to the cease-fire, which we hope will 
take place in the near future -- the sooner the better -- 
parallel to that, work has to be done on the cessation, or at 
least the suspension of the other forms of hostilities that have 
been very obviously and aggressively expressed toward the 
Bosnian Serb side, and Yugoslavia. The sanctions are one form 
of these hostilities. They are affecting equitability, they are 
making the negotiations more difficult, and are preventing any 
political solution that is reached from being turned into 
reality. We also have this media war that is still going on; it 
is also a form of hostility. It is making the psychological 
basis for negotiations more difficult and it is giving 
credibility to the illusions, particularly on the Muslim side, 
that -- with the assistance of these hostilities and those 
expressed through sanctions -- they can obstruct negotiations, 
something that, at the moment, it would appear they would not be 
able to achieve with arms. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] Are there any indications, Mr. Jovanovic, 
that the peace process will include the principle of alleviating 
the sanctions, or gradually lifting them? 
  [Jovanovic] I have already said that the sanctions are a 
form of hostility directed toward one side alone, and this in a 
direct way stops dialogue and negotiations from being a two-way 
process, a process in which all the participants have equal 
starting positions and equal reasons to expect that the positive 
result of their talks will benefit everyone. The most 
principled thing to do would be to eliminate this form of 
hostility along with eliminating the armed form of hostility, 
and the third form I have mentioned. If this cannot be done 
immediately, it is certainly necessary to start lifting the 
absurd sanctions as soon as the agreement on the cease-fire is 
reached. The absurdity of the sanctions is becoming an eyesore 
even to those who imposed them, not to mention how much they 
create negative points for everyone, including those who imposed 
them. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] And those who called for them first, who 
lost a lot because of them. 
  [Jovanovic] I was just about to say that. 
  [Ostojic-Pusina] The decision to call for a ministerial 
conference -- which should be held at the beginning of next week 
-- depends on the political success, that is, the negotiations, 
on things that the contact group, as they call it, will find on 
the ground, and on the dialogue with the two warring sides. 
  [Jovanovic] It is important that the contact group has an 
equitable approach toward all the participants in the civil war. 
This means if it has to exert pressure, then that pressure has 
to be exerted at the same time and equally on all the sides. If 
it is supposed to stimulate more successful negotiations, this, 
too, has to be done equally for all. If this selective attitude 
is maintained, when one side is constantly disfavored while the 
other two sides are constantly favored, then it is clear that 
this is a recipe for failure, not success. 
  [Ostojic-Pusina] We have been reading in the daily press 
that the group has several initiatives -- everything in London 
was behind closed doors -- and there is talk that the final 
stage should again be the much talked about drawing of the 
borders. Abuse is, of course, possible here. 
  [Jovanovic] You see, the demarcation of territories is 
effectively the basic issue -- since the civil war is being 
waged because every side believes or feels that it is endangered 
on its ethnic territory by the other side or sides. The 
question is merely whether the territorial demarcation should be 
done before, after, or at the same time. All three methods have 
already been tried. Not one of them has produced a conclusive 
result even though the method used last summer and autumn was 
the most successful so far. Were it not for the hesitation, not 
to say obstruction, on the side of the Muslims at the last 
minute, we would already have had peace in Bosnia for six or 
seven months now. 
  However, whichever way you solve or try to solve this 
question, it cannot be resolved by pressuring one side and 
supporting the other sides. This has to be the result of 
agreement, of consensus of all three sides, and the other 
participants in the process have to offer only so-called 
positive support to make the negotiations easier and help out 
with useful ideas if there is a halt in the negotiations. 
  [Ostojic-Pusina] If possible, could you comment at the end 
of this interview on Russia's role in the peace process? We 
have witnessed some vacillations in certain statements and views 
of the Russian administration. Some analysts say that the West 
is involving Russia in the peace process only when the decision 
has already been made. Others say that this is because Russia 
does not want to defy the West over Bosnia or a place like 
Gorazde. Can you tell us something about that? 
  [Jovanovic] You see, relations between Russia and the West 
are very complex, sometimes contradictory, sometimes delicate. 
In any case, we do not have enough data for a final 
determination. It is possible that relations will exist in this 
immature and fluid form until the elements of the new balance of 
power are crystallized, which are at the moment being 
established painstakingly, very controversially, and desperately 
before our very eyes. 
  We, as the Balkans, as Yugoslavia, are only one weight on 
the scales, sometimes heavier, sometimes lighter -- depending on 
how either side wants to use the weight to improve or establish 
the balance in its favor. What has been coming from Russia -- 
regardless of the reasons, which can be understood and 
explained, and perhaps even justified -- is something that 
characterizes one great power in its relations with another 
great power, and shows that the interests of a great power and a 
smaller country are not always in concord and uniform, and can 
even be in contradiction. 
  This is not news to us. We have had evidence of such 
behavior in the past in relations with other great powers, 
including Russia -- both Red and Blue. The last time it 
happened was when Russia voted for the imposition of sanctions, 
and now giving approval for the engagement of NATO against the 
Serbs in Bosnia is a similar moment, which will be food for 
thought not only for us, for this generation, but for 
generations yet to come. All great powers try to avoid such 
acts as much as possible, and if possible not have anything to 
do with them. 
  However, the nature of our relations with Russia is such 
that 
all such events nevertheless end as episodes, and they do not 
influence in a more essential and more permanent way the 
constants in the closeness of our interests in various spheres. 
So, despite everything, Russia continues to play a positive and 
constructive role in the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis 
because, out of all foreign participants, Russia is still by far 
the most objective and as such a necessary element for 
correcting and balancing the one- sided policy of the majority 
of other parties. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] And finally, in summary, do you think that 
this is a path toward peace, with the understanding of course 
that the contact group must treat both warring sides equally, 
and not as has been the case so far. This would mean a lot in 
practice for the FRY. 
  [Jovanovic] Of course it is important for the warring sides, 
but it is also important for the sides that are not at war. We 
are not a country at war, but we are a very interested country, 
we are very interested in having this war end in a just and 
lasting way. However, we are nevertheless in an unequal position 
for reasons that I have already mentioned, even though we are 
expected to continue in our active and dominant partnership role 
to build peace, to find the final political solution. This 
partnership, this cooperation has to be based on mutual respect 
and equal status, and not on the basis of subordination, which 
is just another word for sanctions and the punishment of one 
partner. 
  [Ostojic-Pusara] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by "jip": "The Cabinet Accepted the Security </F>
Report"] 
  [Excerpt] Prague--The Cabinet accepted the revised report 
by Interior Minister Jan Ruml on security in the Czech Republic. 
After the session, Minister Ruml said that no immediate threat 
to the Czech Republic and its population can be derived from the 
analysis of the present situation. In addition to the analysis, 
the revised report lists the main risks and specific measures, 
adopted or prepared by the government, for their elimination. 
The legislative concept of the government in the security 
sphere is enclosed. 
  The report indicates that two distinct groups of risks exist 
for the Czech Republic. Among the large ones, immediately 
affecting the stability of the political system, are especially 
migration, ethnic conflicts, financial scheming, and the 
narcotics problem. The group of small risks, threatening 
protection of freedoms, health, and the property of citizens, 
includes general crime (car theft, burglaries) and economic 
crime (tax evasion and fraud). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski by </F>
correspondent Beata Kostrzewska; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kostrzewska] You were supposed to be going to 
Romania, but you stayed in the country. Was this to meet with 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak? 
  [Krzaklewski] I postponed my visit to Romania because of the 
strike at the brown-coal mines, which is not only an internal 
action within the mining sector but also a protest action on the 
part of the entire trade union. 
  [Kostrzewska] What was the subject of your talk with Prime 
Minister Pawlak several hours before the start of the strike at 
the brown-coal mines? 
  [Krzaklewski] We discussed two things. First, the general 
ways of tackling the "popiwek" [enterprise tax on 
above-normative pay] act and, second, specific projects involved 
in decentralization of the wage-regulation system. If we do not 
create appropriate mechanisms in that sphere, we will never move 
to the stage of civilized wage control. Appropriate acts 
related to these solutions should be introduced with the same 
speed with which the popiwek act is being processed at the 
moment. I should also like to add here that Prime Minister 
Pawlak approved our proposal in our talk. Unfortunately, 
however, it seems that it is the chief accountant rather that 
the state's chief administrator who runs the country at the 
moment because yet another revised version of the popiwek act 
has been submitted for parliamentary debate. 
  [Kostrzewska] What is Solidarity hoping for at the moment? 
  [Krzaklewski] We expect sensible and consistent action from 
the prime minister. He must stress his position as head of 
government. I cannot imagine a situation where a prime minister 
hailing from a political configuration that commands the 
parliamentary majority would be saying one thing while deputies 
from coalition parties would be saying another altogether. If 
this is a manifestation of a lack of political cohesion or an 
internal conflict within the coalition, these things are bound 
to come to the surface soon. If, on the other hand, it is a 
deliberate strategy pursued by the prime minister, the 
consequences will soon follow. 
  [Kostrzewska] What were your impressions from your talk with 
Prime Minister Pawlak? 
  [Krzaklewski] It was a man-to-man talk. The prime minister 
showed considerable knowledge of the subject, which is something 
that does not happen too often in talks with government 
representatives. I can see that Mr. Pawlak has studied our 
project for decentralized wage-control mechanisms quite 
conscientiously. However, this should oblige him even more to 
fulfill the promises he has made to us. But it is quite obvious 
that, as far as the prime minister is concerned, politics and 
real life are two different things. On the other hand, we can 
judge the prime minister not only on the basis of the talks we 
have had with him and his public utterances, but also by the 
actions undertaken by his government and parliament. 
  [Kostrzewska] Do you see a chance that your demands will be 
met? 
  [Krzaklewski] Yes, in substantive terms. The system we have 
presented to the government and that is to replace the popiwek 
scheme is perfectly clear-cut, but the government regards its 
possible introduction as a political decision. The authorities 
in power in Poland now are probably afraid of the introduction 
of a decentralized employer-employee communication system. 
Officials in charge of the Finance Ministry are afraid of 
losing the privilege of making centralized decisions regarding 
wages--both in general terms and in individual enterprises. I 
have seen very clear indications of mounting panic in the 
finance sector. 
  [Kostrzewska] How long will the strike at the brown-coal 
mines last? 
  [Krzaklewski] Until it has brought results. The miners are 
most firmly determined, and I hope their example will make the 
government realize the meaning of compromise with the trade 
unions--that is, a will to step down part of the way and seek 
solutions that would lie somewhere in the middle between the 
most extreme positions. Until now, the government made 
political decisions to ensure that there would be no compromise 
with Solidarity. The popiwek act has come to parliament's 
attention, but our other demands have not even been 
considered--not even those the government was obliged to meet 
because the previous authorities in power had undertaken to meet 
them. Here I am thinking specifically of the agreements and 
acts signed within the framework of the "Enterprises Act." 
  [Kostrzewska] Is the strike going to continue until you get 
results? In other words, are you going to call it off after the 
scheduled 48 hours, or will you carry on beyond that deadline? 
  [Krzaklewski] We shall see. The Brown-Coal Miners' National 
Strike Committee can, under the terms of the approved procedure, 
apply to the National Protest Action Headquarters to extend the 
strike's proposed time span. That is why the 48 hours are not a 
strict deadline marking the definitive end of this particular 
protest action. We would like to have cut down the time of the 
protest action, but Mr. Pawlak must first give us a certain 
document. I told him myself what that document should entail; 
unfortunately, I cannot discuss it at this moment because I am 
bound by a promise I gave to the prime minister that I would not 
divulge the substance of our talk. 
  [Kostrzewska] During your latest visit to Lodz, you said 
that the Solidarity protest action would last until your demands 
are met and implemented.... 
  [Krzaklewski] And I do maintain that position because we no 
longer believe any declarations or compacts. First, it is 
announced in the TV News that the prime minister is opposed to 
the popiwek act and intends to reject it, and then, two minutes 
later, we hear in the same program that a parliamentary debate 
on a new popiwek project is in progress now. 
  [Kostrzewska] Why have you come to Lodz? Is this only a 
stopover on your way to Belchatow, or did you have any relevant 
decisions to make here? 
  [Krzaklewski] We have important experts here. We came to 
coordinate the union's position on the prime minister's project 
of the ways in which we could depart from the popiwek scheme, 
even though parliament is already debating the new popiwek bill 
without waiting for our union's opinion. 
  [Kostrzewska] Is a meeting with the president very likely? 
  [Krzaklewski] Our invitation is still open, and I believe 
that such a meeting should take place within the next two weeks. 
We want to explain our demands, and ways of implementing them, 
to the president in the obvious hope that, if we give him a 
sufficiently extensive clarification of our position, he will 
become an advocate of our stipulations. They are devised as a 
stabilizing influence, and, at the same time, they propose the 
introduction of a new system: the system of public dialogue. 
Our country needs the implementation of these stipulations, and 
I hope we will finally see the day when their provisions become 
the law in our country.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "Miller Lectures on Strikes in </F>
Senate"] 
  [Text] "Is the government in favor of salary 
controls? What is Waldemar Pawlak's position on the issue? How 
long is this chaos supposed to last?" Senators asked Labor 
Minister Leszek Miller these questions yesterday. "Real 
unanimity is found only in cemeteries," the minister said. 
  Labor Minister Leszek Miller reported to the Senate on the 
situation in which the country has found itself as a result of 
the wave of strikes. According to the minister, the action by 
"Solidarity" may endanger economic stability. "Inflation is 
falling, unemployment has stopped rising, and economic 
indicators are optimistic." This is the way the minister 
portrayed the country's economic picture. "The protests by 
Solidarity are an obstacle to overcoming economic stagnation," 
he lamented. 
  According to Minister Miller, destroying social peace, which 
has been built with so much hard work, may also be a result of 
the strikes, while the social situation is being carefully 
watched by foreign partners, who regard the situation as a test 
of the state's credibility. 
  According to Miller, a majority of demands put forward by 
Solidarity can be discussed within the framework of a trilateral 
commission, which includes representatives of the government, 
employers, and trade unions (the government will strive to have 
the commission's powers defined statutorily). The minister 
thinks, for instance, that it is possible to abandon central 
salary-control measures in state-owned enterprises provided some 
conditions are met. First of all, a process of 
commercialization of these companies must take place. But the 
minister stressed that the government will not be able to 
approve of solutions that would exceed the inflation level 
provided for by this year's budget. 
  Miller also holds it against Solidarity for having withdrawn 
from negotiations concerning social guarantees for citizens. In 
his view, the reason it happened was that Solidarity fears 
losing the special position it enjoyed during talks with 
previous governments. "Negotiations are not as spectacular as 
strikes and demonstrations," Miller said, "but negotiations will 
at least result in changes being made to laws." 
  The minister announced that the government wants to 
establish 
its own rapport with trade unions based on principles of 
partnership and treating all trade union centers the same way. 
  The senators, however, were not happy with these 
explanations. "What is Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's position 
on the neopopiwek [salary-controlling legislation]?" they 
pressured Miller. "There should remain a control of salaries in 
some form until the end of the year," Miller presented the 
government's position. "After that, one can gradually abandon 
such controls, provided certain conditions are fulfilled that 
would prevent an uncontrolled increase in salaries." 
  "How long will this chaos last?" asked Senator Krzysztof 
Kozlowski of the Union of Freedom (formerly Democratic Union) in 
a dramatic tone. "Either one should be in favor of salary 
controls, or against them," he demanded unequivocal 
declarations. Miller responded by saying that the Democratic 
Left Alliance and the entire governing coalition has a right to 
have different views on an issue as fundamental as this one. 
"Real unanimity is found only in cemeteries," Miller said. 
"One can call this chaos, but one could also describe it as 
learning the difficult art of reaching a compromise." 
  "Why does the prime minister not take a stand of his own in 
a 
situation when the country is in danger?" attacked Zbigniew 
Religa, chairman of the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms. 
Miller replied that Pawlak will make a speech in the Sejm on 
Friday [29 April], while the Government's Press Office has 
presented the prime minister's position before.

National Protest Action Staff in Jastrzebie, Katowice Province, 
on 29 April, Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski said that 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's report to the Sejm on the

  [Text] The national protest staff of Solidarity has decided 
to continue the protest action. Here is [Solidarity Chairman] 
Marian Krzaklewski . 
  [Begin Krzaklewski recording] The protest staff has taken 
the 
decision to intensify the protest actions of the union after 3 
May. 
  All union structures will be expected to hold active strikes 
between 4 and 7 May. We call on all workers, including those 
belonging to other trade unions, to take an active part in the 
action of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] 
Solidarity. 
  The demands put forward by NSZZ Solidarity, which the 
government of the Polish Republic is stubbornly ignoring, are 
important demands made by workers and citizens. 
  I was counting on the Prime Minister to put forward some 
concept, in a decisive manner, but the Prime Minister chose the 
tactic of a confrontational speech. 
  Given that he was speaking in such a confrontational manner 
about our union and that his speech was in such very bad taste 
as far as we were concerned, perhaps this time we shall manage 
to do something with this government--[laughing] because I don't 
know any more how to interpret all this. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Adam Soful: "Brown-Coal Mines Suspended Their </F>
Strike; Solidarity-Government; Marek Pol Signed an Agreement 
With Miners" 
  [Text] Brown-coal miners have suspended their 
strikes after signing an agreement with the government. Coal 
supplies to power plants have been resumed. But Solidarity 
Chairman Marian Krzaklewski does not want to give up escalating 
the strike action beginning on 4 May. On Saturday [30 April] 
and Sunday, 18 hard-coal mines were on strike. Labor Minister 
Miller is surprised with the escalation of the protest. 
  The "Solidarity" All-National Strike Committee of Brown-Coal 
Mines decided to suspend its strike action effective Saturday 
afternoon. The government committed itself to initiating an 
amendment to a law on retirement pensions for miners that would 
place brown-coal employees on an equal footing with those 
employed in the sulfur-mining industry. It was determined that 
the extra money that will go into the budget as a result of 
energy price rises will be distributed in agreement with trade 
union experts. Strike participants will not be punished, either. 
  In return, the miners obliged themselves to supply brown 
coal 
to power plants. "The level of supplies will depend on the 
magnitude of the power generation factor that the National Power 
Distribution Center will determine for a given day," said 
Czeslaw Maconko, a strike committee member. The trade unionists 
have announced that the strike action will be stopped after the 
government presents a schedule for meeting the trade union's 
demands. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski stressed that, 
so far, the trade union has not received such a schedule from 
the government, and it is the same case with a proposal for 
negotiations. 
  "There is a need for strikes, but we also need an openness 
to 
compromise," Krzaklewski said during Saturday's rally at the 
Stalowa Wola steelworks, which has been on strike since 28 
April. But the chairman of Solidarity also stressed that a 
compromise cannot amount to the trade union giving up on any of 
its demands. 
  During Saturday's press conference in Przemysl, Krzaklewski 
accused the government of ignoring Solidarity. In his view, the 
precise reason the trade union carried out 774 strikes this year 
is the government's arrogance toward Solidarity. 
  Labor Minister Leszek Miller said on Saturday that, in the 
context of Friday's talks with representatives of the trade 
union within a trilateral commission, he is surprised by 
Solidarity's decision to escalate the protest action. In 
Miller's view, by deciding to escalate the strike action, 
Krzaklewski either was not aware of the contents of talks within 
the trilateral commission or he wants to pressure the 
government, which, in turn, makes talks impossible. 
  Over the weekend, strikes were in progress in 18 hard-coal 
mines and three zinc and lead mines. Mine employees stayed at 
home, with representatives of strike committees on duty at the 
mines. Municipal transportation did not work for two hours in 
the city of Rzeszow on Saturday morning.

  [Text] Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski has said that, 
if the government presents in the coming days a timetable for 
meeting the union's demands, Solidarity will suspend the strike 
action scheduled for 4, 5, and 6 May. 
  In his remarks for "Signals of the Day," Krzaklewski 
stressed, however, that the action would be suspended and not 
called off. It will eventually be called off when the 
government begins to implement agreements jointly reached with 
Solidarity. 
  The Solidarity leader again accused the government of 
causing 
the strikes by not meeting earlier promises as well as of 
intentional dragging out the negotiations with the strikers.

  [Text] Labor Minister Leszek Miller announced that even if 
Solidarity goes on strike as planned on 4 May, the government 
will be ready to continue negotiations on that day in the 
Trilateral Commission, composed of trade union, employer, and 
government representatives. 
  In a statement for the "Signals of the Day" program on 
Polish 
Radio First Program, Minister Miller recalled that, in 
accordance with yesterday's decisions by the Trilateral 
Commission, the talks on 4 May will concern the wage control 
law, the implementation of the State Enterprise Pact, and 
changes in tax regulations. These problems, Leszek Miller 
pointed out, recur in the trade union demands. 
  Minister Miller called yesterday's decision by the 
Solidarity's Protest Action Headquarters to hold strikes on 4, 
5, and 6 May incomprehensible. He stressed that implementation 
of the trade union demands can only be achieved through 
negotiation. According to Miller, the possible Solidarity 
strikes announced for next week can only hamper the talks in the 
Trilateral Commission.

  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak announced on a visit 
to Krakow that the present wave of strikes was an added argument 
for the government against abolishing the tax on the planned 
growth of wages. 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] If we are talking about abolishing 
wage controls, then, in a situation in which we have seen such a 
widespread strike action, those in favor of such a step being 
taken quickly and without any further safeguards are left 
without arguments. 
  We respect all trade unions in an equal manner. We do not 
intend to single out any of them, and we are keen to resolve 
problems. 
  Yesterday was a good day and a good example. These talks 
were undertaken with the participation of all important trade 
unions, which are cooperating within the framework of the 
tripartite commission. It has turned out that, when very varied 
milieux are represented in these direct talks, those that are 
very involved in traditional industries, those that are financed 
from the state budget, the teachers and the health service 
employees, then the exchange of opinions within the trade unions 
themselves makes it possible to understand the situation better 
and to find solutions. 
  It also turns out that the government is not the only party 
that should take all of the actions that are required. The 
tripartite commission, attended by Solidarity and other trade 
unions, accepted that, as a first step, on 4 May, three matters 
would be discussed: the law on wage control, initial income tax 
installments, and a timetable for introducing laws concerning 
the pact on enterprises. 
  The protests are not justified on such a large scale, nor is 
the dramatic involvement of the planning departments of our 
industry. All the same, however, they show very clearly how 
great the people's impatience is that these difficult matters be 
resolved. This is a sign for us. I believe that we need a 
sincere dialogue. [end recording] 
  This was an excerpt from a statement by the prime minister, 
who was in Krakow today and took part in a meeting of the 
management from the national fire service and voluntary fire 
brigades.

<F P=106> [Report to the Polish Sejm by Prime Minister Waldemar </F>
Pawlak--live] 
  [Text] Mr Speaker: May it please the House! As you know, 
thousands of enterprises, schools, universities, and private and 
state companies worked yesterday. Millions of Poles, to the 
best of their abilities and skills, were building our common 
life. Really a lot of good things happened yesterday. However, 
yesterday will remain the day of strikes and conflicts. I do 
not want to assess reasons for this strike because I was brought 
up in different conditions and with a different system of 
values. That is why agreement, cooperation, goodwill, and 
working together are closer to me then conflict. In my opinion, 
competition is not about putting each other down and destroying 
an opponent. Even during a time of conflict, it is possible to 
be partners and not opponents. 
  Today's strikes are not only a political game. Behind the 
majority of strikes, even those of manipulation, there are 
difficult, often dramatic, situations of employees who 
participate in them, although they would rather not strike. 
There is a common opinion that strikes are organized in 
strategic industries because that is where their effects are the 
most visible and painful for the country. The fact is that 
employees in those industries are not paid badly today. But 
they think that the situation may change for the worse, they are 
afraid of restructuring and redundancies, and they are worried 
about the future. The government repeatedly stressed that our 
main concern was to secure jobs. If anyone was threatening 
redundancies, he was simply lying. 
  May it please the House! Let us ask now what caused the 
current strikes. 
  A complete presentation of the current situation of the 
state, of the reforms and plans for the coming years will be 
presented to the House after the first six months of 1994. 
Today, I would only remind you that results of the first 
quarter of this year could be described as very good. We have 
achieved the most dynamic growth in production in 20 years and 
the lowest inflation in the past seven years. 
  Last year, after the introduction of preferences for 
enterprises, which demonstrate income figures and reinvest this 
income, we have the situation where it is profitable for 
enterprises to pay taxes. As a result of this and other 
changes, budget revenue went up 15 percent in comparison with 
the first quarter of last year. In February of this year, in 
accordance with the government's proexport policy, we had a 
surplus in foreign trade for the first time in 20 months. In 
the first quarter of 1994, the foreign currency reserves have 
increased. 
  In connection with the government's debt-reduction policy 
and 
preferences for well-managed enterprises, a dramatic improvement 
in efficiency can be observed. We achieved those results by 
introducing and maintaining a certain financial regime. As you 
know, we did not immediately abolish the excess wage increase 
tax. We did not immediately implement other election promises. 
But we increased the lowest old age and disability pensions. 
We took care in securing budget revenue and, at the same time, 
creating opportunities for investments. 
  On the other hand, decisions regulating custom duties and 
discouraging smuggling and other economic crimes were important 
for the government's economic policy. I hope the House will 
share the government's opinion that careful modification of 
policies without excluding the past positive trends, so 
modification without shocks and leaps, also contributed to 
positive economic results in the first quarter of 1994. 
  May it please the House! If all trends from the first 
quarter proved to be permanent, it would mean that we are coming 
out of the recession faster then the developed West European 
countries. This would also mean that those people who up to now 
have not yet felt it in their homes will feel it in the second 
half of the year or next year. If one immediately adds that, 
over the past two months, among other things, in recognition of 
our economic achievements we have achieved a reduction of debts 
in the London Club and agreement to a second stage of reduction 
in the Paris Club, then probably no one will hold it against me 
for saying that a dozen or so days ago, we had the full right to 
be optimistic in looking at our future. 
  But good economic results do not come of themselves, nor 
are they given once and for all. They can quickly be eaten away 
and, worse still, squandered through, for example, economic 
disorder. We have been brought face to face with just such a 
danger. Strikes, particularly in the brown-coal power industry, 
are today increasing the costs of using imported energy. 
Tomorrow they may lead to the return of economic crisis, the 
collapse of weaker enterprises, the squandering of what we are 
already achieving at such cost. 
  Ladies and gentlemen deputies, may it please the House! 
Solidarity at the turn of 1980-81 bore our common dreams of 
democracy and a new system of government. Then came years of 
tough trials and many disappointments. There are also many 
things we cannot be satisfied with today, but times have changed 
and Solidarity is not the same as it was then. We have 
democratic institutions for resolving disputes and many legal 
forms of vindicating one's rights, or convincing other people of 
the legitimacy of one's own interests. 
  Why, in this situation, is the harshest form of protest 
being 
used? Why is the blow aimed not where people have the most 
difficult lives but where it causes the greatest 
disorganization? Why do the Solidarity leaders not want 
negotiations as partners with the government? Why do they not 
want talks along with the other trade unions, but organize... 
[pauses] confine themselves mainly to drawing up sole 
legitimate demands, attempting to humiliate the government, and 
showing contempt for the remaining trade unions? 
  For many months now, negotiation teams have been operating 
with the participation of the main trade unions, the employers, 
and the self-governments. A number of agreements have been 
signed--one can point, in particular, to housing construction 
and health care. The only trade union not taking part in this 
work is Solidarity, and maybe that is why there are such strong 
protests because the representatives of that trade union are 
simply not aware how far advanced the agreements and the search 
for solutions are. 
  We do not want to present those solutions as the best and 
the 
only ones. We want to agree on them through consultations and, 
on this, we want to build our program for the next years, 
1995-97. 
  In the past few days, various emissaries are said to have 
gone to workforces that want to work, with the order: Tomorrow 
you go on strike. How are they so sure of their rights to 
decide for others? Those people who censor and shorten 
government communiques are behaving similarly, as if no room 
could be found for half a page, a page, or even two pages of 
text presenting the government's position, among so many pages 
undermining the government's position. 
  You can read the details in one of today's newspapers who 
really would be hurt by that. It is a pity that the reality our 
government faces means that my statement today in the House will 
most probably not be published in full anywhere. 
  In a television program a few days ago, one of the young 
strike organizers said that a change of the Sejm law was not a 
problem; it was just the matter of coming into agreement here. 
That was the case in Poland when the democratically elected 
Sejm and senate did not exist and when a lot had to be changed, 
although, even then, not everything had to be destroyed. 
  Today we are wiser because of our experience, and we should 
protect democracy even before ourselves. We should defend Sejm 
powers that are undermined by those representatives of strike 
committees who think agreement between their committee and the 
government is enough to decide matters that are within the 
authority of the parliament. 
  Ladies and gentlemen! Saying this as one of you I cannot 
help 
being under the impression that we are responsible. May it 
please the House! There are situations when it is difficult to 
find a good solution. One of them is the way wage increases 
should be controlled. We are looking for such a control system 
that does not hinder the dynamics of economic growth and 
improvement of the society's welfare and one that does not 
threaten a return of inflation and a wasted opportunity for 
coordinated development. 
  We know the dispute surrounding these matters as the dispute 
about the "popiwek" and the "neopopiwek" [wage control] laws. 
The government's position on this matter is as follows: The 
government intended and still intends to abandon administrative 
forms of wage control in the state sector by the end of 1994, at 
the latest. During this period, we intended to bring in 
different, more flexible forms of wage control, of increasing 
the independence of enterprises in managing their own wage 
funds. After President Walesa questioned the wage control act, 
after my meeting with the leaders of 16 trade unions, and after 
serious discussion, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers we 
drew up the conditions under which the risk of managing [wage 
funds] already in 1994 without such a law could be taken. Here 
they are; the sequence is also a result of today's circumstances: 
  First, it is a question of joint responsibility, including 
the trade unions, and a halt in particular to strike pressure 
for wage increases. 
  Second, transferring wage negotiations to the work of the 
tripartite commission, invested with very firm powers by the 
Sejm law safeguarding the representative character of the trade 
unions and the agreement... [pauses] the implementation of these 
decisions through workplace collective agreements. 
  Third, the commercialization of enterprises, and therefore a 
move to the formula of enterprises adapted to a market economy, 
on the basis of the commercial code. 
  And even if there were strong arguments for taking the 
courageous risk of abandoning the "popiwek," today those 
arguments are overwhelmed by the situation we are dealing with 
because the fundamental fear that a lack of statutory wage 
control does not safeguard us from a spontaneous increase in 
wages becomes a particularly strong argument in these 
circumstances. 
  There are various versions of the wage control law. There 
were, after all, very tough solutions, which led to a 
stratification of incomes because small enterprises could not 
afford to pay the "popiwek." There were those, too, that, 
despite the very difficult economic situation, simply did not 
pay the wage tax and increased wages. 
  Today, we have to deal with the fruits of this law. And now, 
when the Sejm has introduced solutions wherein the law on the 
control of wages relates solely to those enterprises in which 
the state has 80 percent of the capital, more than 80 percent, 
the law does not relate to the cooperative movement, does not 
relate to enterprises in which the average wage is less than 75 
percent of the national average. Very little is said of this. 
And today, those who so consistently struggle against this 
"popiwek" forget where they were during the time when the 
previous law was in force, and where they will be when the lack 
of this control brings about a still greater stratification of 
incomes. What will they use to explain themselves to all those 
who have maintained discipline, in many enterprises, so that 
enterprises could develop, that they again remain behind because 
the structure of the market quite simply does not allow them to 
so quickly increase incomes as in those that have a structurally 
good position on the market. In this situation, we acknowledge 
that a quick forsaking of the law on wages control is associated 
with a real return of, a real risk of a return of, inflation. A 
return to excessive imports and the possibility of the 
manifestation of other consequences that may disturb the rate of 
growth that has been attained this year. An unprepared 
forsaking of wage controls also threatens that which the trade 
union leaders are aware of, an increase in unemployment and a 
fall in real incomes. Will trade unionists today declare 
responsibility for what will happen later, or will it again be 
the case that the entire responsibility will fall solely and 
exclusively on the government? That, too, is why we accepted 
without opposition the initiative of a group of Polish Peasant 
Party deputies bringing under consideration of the Sejm the law 
on the control of wages. The Sejm speaker decided that it 
should be considered under an accelerated procedure. The 
government treats this law as a last resort that must be used if 
needed for defense against the threat of inflation. It is not 
appropriate to use it at a time when this threat does not exist. 
Nonetheless, in light of the recent strikes, the government 
does not intend to seek the suspension of the process of 
introduction of this law. As I have already said, for the 
period until the end of 1994--and I expect the acceptance of 
parliament and the president. In the system of democracy we are 
constructing, the government is responsible for the economic 
development of the country. 
  May it please the House! One of the postulates is the demand 
for the immediate introduction of the enterprise pact. This is 
a demand addressed to the Sejm, which of course does not 
immediately introduce anything. 
  Let me recall that it was as early as 4 November 1993 that 
the government submitted the first five laws on the enterprise 
pact. The two most important ones for employees generally have 
already been passed. On 29 December, the law on the protection 
of employees' claims in case of employer's insolvency was 
adopted. On 4 March, the law on the enterprise welfare fund was 
passed. Two other laws were considered by a Sejm extraordinary 
commission. They are: the law on the financial economy of a 
state enterprise and on the division of profit in certain state 
treasury companies. As regards the fifth submitted law, 
amendments to the labor code, the commission did not do any work 
on it after the first reading. 
  The final law that belongs to the [enterprise] pact is the 
law on privatization. This bill is to be considered by the 
government in May of this year. In it, among other things, we 
envisage the transfer of the ownership transformation initiative 
to the enterprise bodies and administrative control over 
decisions made in this respect. We have also been considering 
the possibility of increasing the number of shares given free of 
charge to employees, farmers, and fishermen. Does the protest 
also concern these changes? Let us ask the employees directly. 
  This bill will be submitted to the Sejm in May. Who, then, 
needs to be prompted out loud in the case of the enterprise 
pact, which is directed at the government? Probably only those 
who do not remember or do not wish to remember that, at the same 
time, the government proposed and the parliament passed the law 
on the indexation of old age and disability pensions, which 
raised the lowest benefits; the law on the determination of 
remuneration in the public sector; a number of financial laws 
that guaranteed income for the state budget as well as 
concessions to the investors. Generally, the coalition 
government submitted 68 and the Sejm passed 26 new laws. Each 
of these laws addresses certain needs; each of them is also a 
subject of social scrutiny. 
  We are building the program for the years 1994-97 together 
with the trade unions, employers, local governments. We are 
also inviting solidarity to start our joint construction program. 
  People have the right to demand that restrictions be 
abolished, but these very same people do not want to live on a 
volcano. They expect the government to provide peace and 
security and that tomorrow will be better than today. Our 
government is in a position to implement such a program. 
Consistency and prudence in the transformations are some of the 
conditions. 
  Mr. Speaker, may it please the House! In a few days, we will 
have another 3 May anniversary, the anniversary of the great 
opportunity and the great tragedy. 
  There is a great opportunity before Poland. I believe that 
we will not destroy it through unnecessary resistance and a lack 
of ability to compromise. I believe that common sense will 
prevail. I am convinced that the place of strikes and the 
philosophy of who does what to whom will be taken by talks, 
including talks at the tripartite commission, which are being 
continued at this moment by the trade unions and representatives 
of employers with the government. This is a commission we wish 
to put on a statutory basis, a commission that will function 
according to the principle of respect for partners and the 
principle of representativeness. Let us reject mutual 
reservations, and let us consider together what to do so as to 
strengthen our achievements hitherto and resolve those problems 
that still await resolution. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, before us we have a few days off--not, 
fortunately, on account of the strikes. Before us we have 
anniversaries that are important for our country. Although I 
began my speech today with fear that yesterday was a day of 
conflicts, I hope that this will also be the start of their 
effective resolution. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Dobrochna </F>
Kedzierska, Marek Krol, and Boguslaw Mazur under the "WPROST 
Conversations" rubric; place and date not given: "Teamwork"] 
  [Text] [WPROST] There is a strong coalition behind your 
Cabinet, Mr. Prime Minister, but the social perception is that 
there continues to be no stabilization. What is the reason for 
that? 
  [Pawlak] First of all, the reason is the kind of approach to 
the issue that you are demonstrating here. Almost any situation 
can be interpreted in a way that would confirm someone's 
preconceived notion. I think that, if one takes a look at the 
facts, one can see that there are no signs of the instability 
you mentioned. Sure, we have plenty of interesting situations 
and difficult dilemmas, but I do not think there is any big 
danger to the functioning of the state. Economic indicators 
confirm unequivocally that the economy is developing very 
smoothly. Take, for instance, the figures regarding price 
increases for the first quarter, which are the best in seven 
years, and we have also reported a major increase in output. We 
should conduct politics in a determined manner, and often times 
in a way that would be attractive and interesting to voters and 
journalists, provided economic stability is not interfered with. 
  [WPROST] Given that the situation in parliament is optimal, 
why is that not reflected in a clarity of political arrangements? 
  [Pawlak] Every country has its own interesting events that 
make it possible for journalists to discuss interesting topics 
and to predict various scenarios of how the situation may 
develop. But, if you take a look at specific problems, then, in 
my view, society does not feel any special kind of anxiety over 
the fact that some terribly unstable situation has just emerged, 
even though, indeed, there are a lot of issues stirring up 
emotions, such as the issue of appointing a deputy prime 
minister for economic affairs, or what has been happening on the 
stock market, even though, in the latter case, it does not 
affect a large part of society. In the case of the stock 
market, it turned out in practice that the "bag" out of which 
enterprises wanted to gain capital for their ventures is empty, 
and that all that happens at the stock market is that money is 
shuffled from one place to another: Some sell and others buy, 
but the actual amount of capital is seriously limited. 
  [WPROST] You said the people have no reason to feel anxious. 
How do you manage without a finance minister and a deputy prime 
minister for economic affairs? 
  [Pawlak] As I have said many times before, coalition rules 
are about teamwork, and the condition of the team as a whole 
counts. For the moment, we are lacking a "forward left" on the 
"field," but that does not change the fact that our team has 
scored some very good results. Among the practical successes, 
the following can be listed, which will remain so in the future: 
the restructuring of our debts incurred with the London Club, 
and a second stage of debt reduction with the Paris Club. These 
are not spectacular events, but they remain important to the 
economy and investors alike. I am talking about that here 
because what smacks of sensation from a journalist's viewpoint 
does not necessarily have to be reflected in the functioning of 
the economy right away. 
  [WPROST] But sometimes such sensationalist issues are 
reflected in social life, such as through threatened strikes or 
disputes surrounding the so-called neopopiwek 
[salary-controlling] law. Your position on the latter issue is 
not clear to the public at large. So, does Poland need 
salary-control mechanisms? 
  [Pawlak] What we need are mechanisms that would protect 
economic and social stability. A trilateral commission has been 
established that includes representatives of employers, trade 
unions, and the government. This creates a chance to define 
general parameters concerning salary increases in the economy. 
Following the acceptance of the president's veto, one should 
think about whether it pays to go back to the "shaky grounds" of 
a mechanism that has largely ceased to function anymore, or 
whether one should implement changes regarding the merits. 
After all, one could travel down a path that would require 
responsibility by the trade unions, the managing cadre, and the 
government. If it were not for salary-increase pressures, a 
possibility would occur for establishing general principles of 
shaping salary policies by the trilateral commission, followed 
by making them more specific through collective agreements. 
Commercialization of the economy is also an important issue, as 
well as moving away from a valorization of benefits vis-a-vis 
salary increases to a valorization vis-a-vis price increases. 
  [WPROST] The problem of whether we are, first of all, 
supposed to invest or consume, has not been resolved in Poland 
yet. 
  [Pawlak] We have been introducing mechanisms that are 
conducive to making investments. Income tax and dividends are 
supposed to play that function in enterprises. If some of that 
revenue is devoted to investments, another part may be devoted 
to salaries, and these regulations should be defined nationwide; 
there are enterprises with a structural position on the market 
that allows them to separate themselves from situations at the 
remaining enterprises. We cannot have a situation where an 
expert for maintenance of electronic equipment earns 20 million 
zlotys [Z] a month because he just happened to come across a 
company with a very good market position, whereas an employee 
working in a company manufacturing some extremely complicated 
computers, but with a low popiwek basis at the beginning would 
earn just Z3 million a month. 
  [WPROST] You mentioned the responsibility of trade unions, 
among others. Do you know for a fact that they will actually be 
responsible, or do you just have faith in their reasonable 
attitude? 
  [Pawlak] Fortunately, it is a trait that can be verified in 
practice. After a debate in the Council of Ministers, during 
which an overwhelming majority of ministers spoke in favor of 
introducing salary-controlling mechanisms, I spoke with the 
chairmen of more than 10 trade unions. I asked them whether, in 
a situation of lack of a statute, the trade unions are capable 
of resisting temptations to raise salaries under control. And I 
must say that the responses were positive in large majority. I 
think trade unions are interested in not destabilizing the 
situation in the process of abandoning salary controls. On the 
other hand, there have been attempts--for instance, in the 
Polish State Railroads--to use the current situation to satisfy 
pressures for salary increases. Such cases substantially weaken 
my arguments, and they may make it necessary to adopt a law that 
would control salaries. The government has spoken out in favor 
of the Sejm being able to "suspend" such a law, on a motion by 
the Council of Ministers. This would create an opportunity for 
trade unions, employers, and the government to act in concert. 
Various things may prove necessary in practice. 
  [WPROST] Aside from conflicts with trade unions, there have 
been conflicts among the different power centers. The president 
has expressed criticism regarding your decision to conduct 
self-governmental elections by saying that you should not have 
done it before he vetoes the new electoral law. One may have a 
feeling that there is no one main decisionmaking center in 
Poland. 
  [Pawlak] It is much easier to find solutions if we 
concentrate on practical problems and not on "positions." The 
case of the self-governmental elections shows that there is a 
time when one can debate various solutions, but then the time 
schedule forces us to make a decision. Postponing those 
decisions makes us enter a period where conducting elections 
becomes somewhat risky because elections make sense in 
June--that is, before vacation season. From that standpoint, it 
is important to search for practical solutions to problems 
instead of insisting on one's "position." 
  [WPROST] The previous government was impotent because it did 
not have a majority in the Sejm, whereas your government's 
activities seem to be blocked by the Belweder. 
  [Pawlak] Statistics defy such suppositions: A majority of 
laws were, in fact, signed by the president. But there are also 
cases of some interesting situations, such as the salary-control 
law. But I still think the president's veto forced everybody to 
think carefully about the new solutions. So it follows that, 
when one approaches problems practically, there is no situation 
where there would be no positive solution whatsoever. If one 
could carry out everything very easily, life would be very 
boring indeed. 
  [WPROST] But can you see any solution with regard to the 
government-Belweder relationship? 
  [Pawlak] So many problems arose that one just had to get rid 
of them--and that was what the meeting between the president and 
the Democratic Left Alliance Parliamentary Club was all about. 
  [WPROST] You are talking about teamwork and about successes, 
but the opposition accuses you of not having a strategic concept 
of leading the country, citing the dispute surrounding the 
neopopiwek as an example. 
  [Pawlak] In that particular case, the opposition fell into 
its own trap because it could have acted a little more 
responsibly during the vote, and it could not have provided such 
a categorical reply. After all, our offer was quite open. But, 
when it comes to this government's strategy, it is not one of 
imposing decisions on others but one of showing the direction. 
I have spoken out many times regarding the main priorities. I 
will repeat this once again: If we talk about heading in the 
direction of democracy and a social market economy, we are doing 
this to guarantee Poland a high-ranking place in the family of 
free nations. We are eager to see cultural, intellectual, and 
economic development of society and the state. Experience of 
recent years demonstrates that a few principles should be 
observed. First of all, changes must take place in an 
evolutionary manner and without sudden, radical moves. Second, 
it is necessary to widen support for the reforms by establishing 
mechanisms for active participation by large segments of society 
in the processes of change. The third principle is about a need 
to make our actions, structures, and procedures rational. 
Finally, what is also important is the development of human 
capital, broadly speaking. We must create practical 
possibilities of investing in technologies elaborated by our 
scientists, and a system of investment breaks could serve that 
goal. One must also secure economic and social stability. That 
makes up the general plan that must be the basis for detailed 
actions. We can really gain a strong position and be an 
important country in this part of the world. Some big 
challenges are ahead of us, but they are not insurmountable for 
a country located in the center of Europe, with big intellectual 
potential and inhabited by people with imagination.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Economic Cooperation Minister Leslaw </F>
Podkanski, by Urszula Kujawska; place and date not given: "Forum 
of Cooperation"] 
  [Excerpts] From 5 to 7 May, the Third East-West 
Conference will be held in Warsaw; it will be a meeting of the 
ministers of foreign economic cooperation, trade, and industry 
of the seven richest states and 10 countries implementing 
reforms (so-called G-7 and E-10). It is customary that such a 
conference is held in the country that at the moment chairs the 
G-7; however, this time the conference will be held in Poland. 
It will be the first conference of the economic ministers of 
the "seven" and states implementing reforms in a postsocialist 
country. [passage omitted] 
  [Kujawska] Last year's balance of foreign trade ended up in 
a deficit. What is your evaluation of this phenomenon? 
  [Podkanski] I believe that, at this point, we should 
separate two issues: foreign trade and the evaluation of its 
results, and the broadly understood transformations and social 
costs related to them. As far as Poland is concerned, 1993 was 
very unfavorable to the balance of foreign trade, which amounted 
to $2.3 billion. There were many reasons for this, both 
internal and external. The latter are related to the recession 
in the world. 
  Right now, our economy needs capital and supply investments. 
  There is also the problem of fiscal instruments that would 
regulate the economy in 1993. Until August 1993, the 
exchange-rate policy favored imports rather than exports because 
the rate of devaluation of the zloty was clearly slower than the 
devaluation rate of the U.S. dollar or the German mark, and even 
than the scale of inflation in Poland. Apart from all this, 
there were various external issues, linked to the difficult 
situation of most medium-sized and small companies and difficult 
access to commercial and operating credits. Adding to these 
problems was the issue of the so-called infrastructure of 
exports--guarantees, guarantees of insurances, promotion. I 
believe it is necessary to create a uniform, coherent, and clear 
system of promotion, which we strive to establish. 
  These are also experiences we want to share with our 
partners 
of G-7 and E-10. 
  [Kujawska] What are the relations between Poland and its 
southern neighbors, who are participants in this conference? 
  [Podkanski] I would like to stress strongly that, even 
though the signature of the agreement on free trade within the 
Visegrad Group last year did not yield any spectacular results 
in the form of an increase in the trade volume, we can still 
state with satisfaction that this agreement curbed the rate of 
decrease in cooperation, including a commercial exchange, which 
has been observed since 1991. This goes for both the exchange 
of commodities and the disappearance of so-called investment and 
cooperation links, which was a natural reaction at the moment of 
passing to free-market settlements. I believe that today all of 
the states will agree to pass to the free-market system, and 
that the rules of the game of the free market should go hand in 
hand with the ability to take advantage of the technical, 
technological, and production potentials that are possessed. 
They should also go hand in hand with the presentation of a 
commodity offer that would take into account the balance of the 
possibilities and needs of the markets of our neighbors. The 
commodity exchange with our neighbors is favorable--for example, 
because of lower transportation costs. This supports the 
argument that we should first seek contact with our neighbors, 
and only then across the ocean. 
  There is no doubt, however, that there are areas and 
industry 
branches that may find partners across the ocean as well--in 
South America, in Brazil, for instance. Recently, in talks with 
a delegation of this state, we found many very interesting 
undertakings that may be very important to both states in the 
future; one of them is the proposal made by Brazilian investors 
concerning Polish transshipment ports--for example, for 
Brazilian iron ore, which might be shipped from Polish ports to 
the Visegrad Group states. Thus, in this way, we are trying to 
facilitate the implementation of goals that G-7 and E-10 are 
also trying to achieve. 
  [Kujawska] The conference is to serve all its participants 
who, in practice, are partners with each other. What would you, 
as the Polish foreign economic cooperation minister, like to 
achieve during this meeting? 
  [Podkanski] I would like to achieve three goals. The first 
one concerns full and genuine knowledge about the desires and 
capabilities of our foreign partners as far as investing in 
Poland is concerned. On the other hand, we would like to present 
Poland, taking into account its geographic location, as a state 
in which it is advisable and in which it pays to invest money. 
I would also like our potential investors to see their chance 
to participate in ownership transformations that are going on in 
our country. Also, I would like them to see their chance in 
linking their interests to Polish investors--for example, in the 
privatization process. I also believe that the conference in 
Warsaw will help the other E-10 states attain the same goals. 
  I also want to make our partners realize that the aim of 
Polish privatization is changing not the owner but the economic 
situation, reconstruction, and the modernization of Polish 
industry. This is important because of the fact that the road to 
membership in the European Union will be long and winding. 
However, these are all inevitable processes. 
  A separate issue is a thorough and solid evaluation of trade 
development prospects in Europe and the world, as well as 
Poland's participation in the international division of labor 
and in the trade turnover of the E-10 states; the evaluation 
should also take into account the rules of the game laid out in 
the Final Act of the Uruguay Round and the recently established 
World Trade Organization. It is a matter of shaping new 
principles and new rules, as well as a new system of world 
trade. Such a meeting right now supplies the answer to any 
doubts and questions concerning Poland's activeness in this 
process and our joining the international structures. I would 
like to be certain after this meeting that there is a joint 
desire, a desire to cooperate, as well as to know where the 
common interests are concentrated; I would also like to know 
what the possibilities of providing systematic solutions to the 
various problems are, through appropriate legal, organizational, 
and financial solutions. There is no doubt that there are great 
differences in the scale of development that has been 
accomplished in individual states. 
  [Kujawska] The Warsaw conference is the third one. At each 
of them, certain decisions were made. Have they been 
implemented, and how have the interested states benefited from 
them? 
  [Podkanski] It will be the third meeting. However, it cannot 
be compared to any of the other meetings because each of them 
was very special; each of them had different values and 
contents, and, mainly, the range of problems was different. The 
present conference is the richest as far as its form and 
contents are concerned. 
  At the request of the Polish party, a meeting of the 
presidents of foreign investment agencies of the E-10 states was 
organized; it was held during the deputy ministerial session in 
March of this year. 
  There will also be an East-West business forum and a 
traditional "roundtable" for the ministers and business 
representatives of each state. The earlier meetings were some 
kind of inspiration and a proposal; the list of members and 
participants is still being extended. At the Tokyo meeting, it 
was decided that small and medium-size business in the E-10 
states must be supported. After the meeting, the Japanese 
Government allocated some money for the model restructurization 
of one of the Polish state-run enterprises of the 
machine-building industry. This is supposed to help work out a 
model of proceedings that can be used in other countries. As I 
see it, this is most valuable because it serves to shape the 
awareness of those who are in power. Also, a model of 
cooperation between countries as well as principles of providing 
aid should be worked out. The Japanese Government is already 
prepared to consider the possibility of granting interesting 
credits to Poland--this is the information I received when Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy returned from Japan. This would be, then, 
a result of the previous visit. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Grzegorzewski: "How Much Haggling, How </F>
Much Market?"] 
  [Text] The debate over the form of the new privatization 
law exploded rather suddenly during a recent meeting of the 
Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers. It was 
unexpected because three ministers knew the draft proposal 
earlier and did not offer corrections to it. The ministers of 
industry, of agriculture, and of foreign economic cooperation 
emerged as opponents of the draft. 
  The fact that this is not the first time the Alliance of the 
Democratic Left has failed to get support from the Polish 
Peasant Party (PSL) only adds color to the situation. But this 
is only one aspect of the affair, not its most important part. 
Three ministries would like to take control of privatization 
away from the Ministry of Property Transformations (MPW) or, at 
the very least, limit the privatization ministry to a minimum. 
Their proposal is that ministers who act as charterers of units 
would make decisions about property transformation in those 
units on their own. 
  The minister of industry would thus become the most 
important 
figure in Polish privatization because the Ministry of Industry 
and Commerce is the largest owner of state firms. It fulfills 
the function of charterer for 764 public-sector firms, ahead of 
the Ministry of Transport and Naval Economy (553 firms), the 
Voivode of Katowice (230 firms), and the Voivode of Lodz (189 
firms). The position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Cooperation would seem to be minor because it controls only 18 
firms; however, these are the great foreign trade bureaus! The 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry has only 47 firms left 
because 1,595 have been handed over to the State Treasury's 
Agency for Farm Property. Nearly all of the former State Farms 
are still held by the state, and these, of course, make up an 
important part of the PSL's unhappy electorate. 
  The owner would thus privatize his own property. There is 
thus a question: If three ministers are to take advantage of 
this possibility, why not all? Would the minister of internal 
affairs, for example, be a good privatizer? That ministry is the 
charterer of one state firm, after all. One could equally well 
imagine the chief of the Physical Culture Office spreading 
privatization culture in his 22 state firms. 
  Have we thus returned to a Poland divided by industrial 
sector? This is certainly one of the dangers but not the only 
one. The stakes are more than 5,000 state firms. Voivodes are 
the charterers of 3,400 of these; central organs control the 
other 1,800. There is general agreement to the fact that control 
of strategic areas of national interest should remain in the 
hands of the ministries. Examples are the energy industry, the 
arms industry, rails, and telecommunications. Many other firms 
could be handed over to voivodes--how many is a question about 
the scope of the decentralization of power. 
  Authority over sole corporations of the state treasury 
(jssp) 
might remain attractive. The privatization ministry has 
transformed 522 state firms into such corporations, while the 
Ministry of Industry has transformed 118 firms into 58 jssp's. 
The MPW has privatized 100 corporations. These have not always 
been attractive finds. However, the MPW's power is also a result 
of its authority over the composition of supervisory boards. 
This has been much less satisfactory for the Ministry of 
Industry and Commerce; for example, seven jssp's were created 
out of 65 coal mines. The industry ministry thus carries the 
weight of restructuring in a very conflict-ridden sphere in our 
economy. The privatization ministry has not aspired to the role 
of privatizer of mining, which requires a costly and thorough 
restructuring. It is not therefore surprising that the 
organization of that process has been left to the Ministry of 
Industry and Commerce. Elimination also of authority over the 
composition of supervisory boards would in this conflict be 
illogical. If this were to be so, we could have some kind of 
repetition of the Borowski-Kawalec case--as we know, Deputy 
Prime Minister Kawalec had authority over the composition of 
supervisory boards in banks. 
  One must also not ignore the act that the reservations about 
the privatization law draft were made at a time when there is no 
deputy prime minister for economic affairs. 
  All of this does not mean, however, that one should defend 
the present scope of MPW authority. A decrease of that scope 
should occur through the aforementioned decentralization of 
ownership powers--the devolution of such powers on voivodes, 
including through the so-called communitization of state 
property. 
  Should there be a Ministry of the Economy? I do not want to 
repeat the arguments from a discussion that recently appeared in 
ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE. The state domain is still so wide that such a 
resolution would seem to be premature, although it could lessen 
the interministry games. 
  Some time ago, the discussion over state treasury 
trusteeships began. It was begun by the privatization ministry, 
even though such institutions would mean a lessening of its 
domain. The point is to bring to light certain scandals 
connected with the partial property rights in privatized 
corporations and with the property left over in the state domain 
after liquidations of public-sector firms. 
  However, one should not confuse the idea behind the creation 
of a super state treasury. A new, huge state administrative 
organ would have to be created because it would have to control 
some 5,000 state firms. If such an institution is to be created, 
it will exercise ownership authority over a significantly 
diminished group of firms. The shrinkage of this group depends 
upon the pace of privatization. At the moment, the best solution 
would be to create such trusteeships. 
  It would be quicker to reach agreements that would divide 
the 
flow of resources from the flow of revenue, and thus the empire 
from its domains. The income from privatization does not create 
a restructuring stream but, instead, serves constantly to patch 
up the budget because the hole in the budget is a drag on 
privatization. Such a divide of revenue could be accomplished 
within trusteeships. 
  Meanwhile, we are witnessing a discussion not about the "map 
of privatization" but about its division into spheres of 
influence. This is not a debate over state treasury trusteeships 
but over the right to exercise ownership supervision in jssp's 
and in partially-privatized corporations. 
  The right to influence over privatization can thus be 
divided 
in different ways--not only by industries or ministries. 
  Every fight over privatization is thus a struggle for 
influence. Privatization itself is a game of interests that are 
often by nature at odds with one another. The problem is the 
quality of that game. The quality of society's understanding of 
privatization depends on the quality of the battles waged over 
it.

<F P=106> [Article by D.W., based on a report of the Institute for the </F>
Study of Foreign Trade Business Cycles and Prices entitled 
"Foreign Investments in Poland," published in Warsaw in 1994: 
""Good but Not Excellent: How Foreign Investors Grade Poland"] 
  [Text] The Institute for the Study of Foreign Trade 
Business Cycles and Prices (IKC) has published its fourth 
regular report on foreign investment in Poland. The report 
discusses in detail the legal and economic conditions of 
investing in Poland. It was authored by Ewa Sadowska Cieslak, 
Jozef Biskup, and Wojciech Burzynski. 
  On the basis of studies by the report's authors, it can be 
concluded that the biggest incentives for investing in Poland 
are, in this order: prospects for our economic growth (about 
53.5 percent of the respondents); the size of the Polish market 
(47.5 percent of the respondents); manpower costs (44.7 percent 
of the respondents); the availability of manpower (33.9 
percent); the possibility of reducing production costs (31.6 
percent); price level (27.9 percent); advantageous conditions 
for investing (27.5 percent); and the possibility of 
repatriating profits (27 percent). 
<H5>  A Potentially Attractive Country </H5>
  Thus, in the opinion of the report's authors, Poland appears 
to be a potentially attractive country. Another advantage is 
that Poland can become a big importer of manufacturing capital 
in view of its capacious market, so-called deferred (and 
unsatisfied) demand, and the enlargement of that market, owing 
to the free-trade zone shared with the other Visegrad countries 
[Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary]. As a result of the still 
low efficiency of most Polish enterprises, considerable profits 
can be derived from selling in this country products whose 
manufacture in highly industrialized countries by now yields 
only below-average profits. 
  Foreign investors considering the possibility of capital 
investment in our country attach considerable importance to the 
very fact that a market economy is being built here. This factor 
was ranked first by 86 percent of U.S. investors, 82 percent of 
Swedish and Dutch investors, and 80 percent of French investors. 
The second-ranking attraction was identified as privatization 
(67 percent of British and U.S. investors, 63 percent of Swedish 
investors, and 76 percent of French investors). In its turn, to 
46.7 percent of French investors, 45 percent of U.S. ones, 39 
percent of Dutch, and 38 percent of German, a major factor in 
their decisionmaking was the possibility of purchasing land and 
real estate. 
<H5>  A Good Policy </H5>
  Contrary to traditional belief, about one-half of the 
investors viewed positively the policy of the Polish Government 
regarding foreign investments. Most respondents were of the 
opinion that the political situation in Poland did not affect 
their activities. 
  Nearly three-fourths of major investors planned to expand 
their operations in this country, but nearly as many hold a very 
low opinion of the taxes binding in our country (83 percent of 
Italian investors, 88 percent of Swiss, 67 percent of German). 
And they are not satisfied with the operating procedures of 
commercial risk insurance, either. They also hold an unfavorable 
opinion about the credit insurance system. 
<H5>  Hungary Is Better </H5>
  The foreign investors answering the questionnaires shared 
the 
opinion that Poland is among the countries with the most 
favorable conditions for investment by foreign capital. 
Nevertheless, they ranked Hungary first in that respect. This is 
also proved by the amount of capital invested in that country. 
By the end of 1993, more than $5 billion had been invested in 
Hungary compared with only half that amount in Poland, although 
declarations for further investment plans suggest an amount 
three times larger. 
  As known, the Americans are the biggest investors in Poland 
(on average, they invested $23 million in each of the companies 
they decided to buy shares in), followed by Italy, with third 
place held by four transnational corporations (including ABB, 
Hewlett Packard, and the issuer [as published] of Cambridge 
Holding) and three international financial institutions. The 
Japanese were a big disappointment, but they were not interested 
in investing in our country until the completion of our 
negotiations with the Club of London. Capital investment was too 
expensive for them in a situation in which, for every dollar 
invested, a matching dollar had to be deposited in a bank. The 
IKC report mentions, however, several companies, including 
Toyota, Nisho Iwai, and Itochu, which committed themselves to 
selling in our country Mazdas, Toyotas, and Hondas, as well as 
several other companies, including Mitsui. However, altogether 
Japanese companies account for n 0.3-percent share in 
investments in Poland. 
  In a situation in which Poland is experiencing a major 
foreign trade deficit, it is important that investors also 
manufacture for export. Thus, while in 1989 the value of exports 
deriving from their enterprises amounted to $179.9 million, in 
1990 it rose to $516 million, in 1991 to $631 million, and in 
1992 to $1.3 billion. Exports per company with participation of 
foreign capital averaged $230,000 in 1992. Even so, as many as 
75 companies are geared to sell their products on the domestic 
market, and the value of their exports did not exceed $37 
million altogether. Furniture and wood products are the best 
exports, followed by garments, with products of the pulp and 
paper industry ranking third and those of the electronics 
industry fourth. 
  According to the data gathered by the report's authors, 
companies with the participation of foreign capital offer higher 
wages, and, in general, their existence has improved the 
situation on the job market. Such companies also are 
characterized by higher labor productivity. It also often 
happens that, while employment increases in the foreign branches 
of these companies, including their branches in Poland, it 
decreases in their mother countries. At any rate, in 12 
countries of Central and East Europe a year ago (latest 
available data), 65,000 companies operated with the 
participation of foreign capital.

    [Editorial Report] Modernizing Poland's outdated telephone 
network, the DGT digital telecommunications firm has developed a 
telecommunications system that should be able to compete with 
foreign-built equivalents. A page 1 article in the 29 March-5 
April Warsaw weekly GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA T HANDLOWA, "a paper for 
entrepreneurs and employers," described the production of the 
DGT3450 system by the firm, which was cofounded by a group of 
graduate students from the Gdansk Institute of Technology 
(Politechnika Gdanska). According to the article, the firm is 
competing on the market with "such giants as Siemens, Alcatel, 
Ericsson, and AT&amp;T," a competition that Waldemar Frenkel, 
Warsaw 
representative of DGT, compares with "domestic car production 
competing with Mercedes or Volvo." 
  The need for digital systems in telecommunications coincided 
with a similar need to modernize the public telephone network, 
and it became clear that this modernization can be achieved by 
putting modern electronic exchanges into service. According to 
the article, disclosure by the state of its needs in this regard 
produced great interest among the above-mentioned Western firms. 
Competing with these firms, DGT also constructed, after several 
years of research, its own telecommunications system, called 
DGT3450, which is now ready for series production. The DGT3450 
system resembles a simple metal cabinet filled with complete and 
highly integrated systems, computer processors, and a 
microcomputer equipped with at least 640 kilobytes of random 
access memory, a hard disk (with at least 40 megabytes), and a 
remote control system. 
  For professionals employed in this field, "construction of 
the telephone exchange in the size and shape of a narrow cabinet 
was some kind of a revelation." Also proving to be a 
revelation, according to the article, was the high technical and 
quality level this design offers. One of its features is a 
modern switching system that uses integrated circuits, 
demonstrating the ability to work together with the outdated 
(10-, 20-, 30-, and 50-year-old) equipment of the Polish 
telephone network. The new DGT exchange that would replace an 
old analog exchange could seamlessly operate with any foreign 
electronic or electromechanical exchange. Another important 
feature of the DGT3450 is its modular design and open 
architecture that allow practically endless expansion. DGT has 
flexibility with regard to the number and type of customer 
circuits and interexchanges. Last, the system meets the needs of 
customers and, by employing energy-efficient technology, is 
close to 50-percent cheaper than those produced by foreign 
companies. The designers emphasize the versatility of this 
"DGT3450 system, which could be seriously considered for 
providing telephone services in the countryside as well as 
serving middle-sized and large enterprises." In fact, DGT 
exchanges are already installed in many hospitals, schools, and 
central and government offices. Because of its economic and 
reliable nature, the system has also been introduced in some 
mining operations, power plants, police stations, the railway 
system, and the Army.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacek Swidzinski: "Second Round of Concessions: </F>
Oil and Gas Prospecting"] 
  [Text] On 12 April 1994 expires the deadline for the 
submission of bids during the second round of bidding for 
licenses to prospect for and explore deposits of crude petroleum 
and natural gas in the Lublin region and the Polish part of the 
Carpathians. The bidding, organized by the Ministry for 
Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, and Forestry, is 
restricted to foreign bidders. 
  Consider that the first round of the bidding resulted in 
granting licenses for oil and gas prospecting in Poland to the 
following companies: Amoco, to prospect for and explore oil and 
gas deposits in central and southeastern Poland and methane in 
black-coal seams in Upper Silesia; and British Gas, to prospect 
for and explore oil and gas deposits in central Poland. A 
similar license for another segment of central Poland was 
granted to the Exxon-Shell Consortium. The above-named companies 
also intend to participate in the second round of bidding, and 
such renowned companies as Mobil, Texaco, and Pan Canadian are 
also expected to participate. 
  Prospecting in the zones allocated as a result of the first 
bidding could commence as early as this spring, except that the 
absence of suitable agreements with the Polish Ministry of 
Finance is an impediment. That is because the prospecting 
companies try, as is the custom worldwide in such situations, to 
debit investment start-up expenditures to operating expenses. 
Under the regulations in force, they are tax-exempt during the 
first three years of their operation, but the start-up period 
(which may involve expenditures roughly totaling $150 million) 
may last as long as six years. Accordingly, the prospecting 
companies desire tax deferment for seven to 10 years in a row, 
and the capitalization of their expenditures after the start-up 
period. In addition, they desire exemption from the VAT 
[value-added tax]. 
  Such terms appear to be highly preferential, slanted in 
favor 
of oil and gas prospectors (or rather prospectors for gas and 
eventually oil), especially considering how well-heeled they 
are. But several other factors have to be considered here. 
First, it is not that Exxon-Shell, Amoco, or Texaco needs 
Poland. On the contrary, by letting these companies in, we could 
save $150 million that would otherwise have to be paid from our 
budget. Second, these companies are too mighty to place them in 
the role of a petitioner for something that is normally granted 
worldwide to oil and gas prospectors. For them to include Poland 
is no big deal, whereas to us this is highly important. 
  There still remains the sensitive issue of the role and 
place 
of a domestic prospector--namely, Polish Oil and Gas Extraction 
Corporation (PGNiG). 
  "Our agreement with the PGNiG divides Poland into two 
zones," 
explained Director Marek Hofman at the Department of Natural 
Resources, in the Ministry for Environmental Protection, Natural 
Resources, and Forestry." The first zone encompasses areas in 
which development is already under way and deposits have been 
explored and are generally easier to develop. Segments of the 
second zone are successively opened to bidding by oil and gas 
prospectors. These segments exist in exceptionally difficult 
geological conditions and are highly risky." 
  Because we are on the subject, we will conclude with some 
good news. Petrobaltic, by now in its capacity as a purely 
Polish company, intends any day now to initiate the development 
of Section B-3 in the Baltic, which is considered highly 
promising. Prospecting in the Polish shelf [of the Baltic Sea] 
is to be continued.

<F P=106> [Article by Elzbieta Maczynska: "The Machine-Building </F>
Industry on the `500 List'"] 
  [Text] The machine-building industry fulfills the function 
of carrier of technical progress and modernity, throwing 
practically all sectors of the economy into development. Thus it 
is vital to analyze the tendencies and developmental trends in 
this sphere. Overall, 134 enterprises of the machine-building 
industry (26.8 percent of the total studied; in 1991, the number 
was 28 percent) are on the `500 List,' and every industry sector 
is represented on the list by several units. 
  The share of enterprises of the machine-building industry in 
the sales value of all 500 List enterprises is 19.3 percent (in 
1991--20.4 percent), or one-sixth of total sales value. 
  Of the 134 enterprises of the machine-building industry on 
the list, only 98 operate at a gross profit. The other 36 take a 
gross loss on the sale of their products. In addition, these 
losses are increased by the dividends these enterprises pay and 
by the tax on above-the-plan growth of wages [popiwek]. With 
these latter included, an additional 10 enterprises (for a total 
of 46) show negative net financial results. 
  The 98 profitable enterprises of the machine-building 
industry showed a gross profit of 5 trillion zlotys [Z] (in 
1991, Z6.2 trillion). However, the 36 loss-bearing enterprises 
showed a gross loss of Z9.2 trillion (in 1991, Z7.2 trillion), 
which significantly exceeded the profits of the other 
enterprises. Thus, these 134 showed a negative gross financial 
balance of over Z4.2 trillion (in 1991, Z903 billion). When 
mandatory costs are included, the negative net financial balance 
comes to Z8.6 trillion. This reveals the catastrophic rise in 
the machine-building industry's debt. 
  As analysis of the data thus indicates, the machine-building 
industry is characterized by deficit, as in 1991, and that 
deficit is increasing. The profitability indicator, calculated 
as the relation of gross financial result to sales, equals 2.1 
percent (in 1991, 1.4 percent); net profitability equaled 87.4 
percent. The profitability of sales came to minus 6.8 percent. 
For the entire machine-building industry, the deficit earnings 
were even higher in 1992, coming to minus 9.6 percent (in 1991, 
minus 8.3 percent). So the profitability of the machine-building 
industry continued to worsen. 
  Enterprises of the machine-building industry absorbed over 
68 
percent of supplementary payments and subsidies made to the 500 
enterprises on the list; their share in costs (18.9 percent) was 
slightly less than their share in sales (19.3 percent). These 
enterprises, however, are characterized by the highest relation 
of costs to financial result--55 percent. The sum of these 
costs, Z4.4 trillion, is close to the sum of gross profit (Z5 
trillion). 
  The current liquidity indicator of the enterprises of the 
machine-building industry on the 500 List was higher than the 
average for the list, coming to 2.1 (for the 500, the indicator 
was 1.9). The same is true for the indicator of rapid 
liquidity--the so-called quick ratio (0.9 and 0.8 percent, 
respectively), and that of immediate solvency (0.3 percent). 
Such a low indicator level shows that these enterprises are 
encountering difficulties with the realization of current 
obligations and payments. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>

  -  Enterprises of the machine-building industry have a 
significant share on the 500 List both of value of sales (19.3 
percent--second place after the food industry) and of employment 
(36.4 percent--first place). 
  -  At the same time, the share in 
payments and costs required by the state budget is similar to 
that in sales--18.9 percent. 
  -  The share of these enterprises in 
total subsidies and supplementary payments is also high, and 
growing, in comparison to 1991. 
  -  As in 1991, the enterprises of 
the machine-building industry show the second-highest deficit on 
the 500 List, after enterprises of the consumer goods 
industry. 
  -  The machine-building industry's indicators, which are 
unfavorable in the context of the 500 enterprises, are the more 
ominous because there is a clear divergence between the volume 
of sales and the size of financial surpluses. Many of the 
enterprises with the highest sales show a negative financial 
result and/or a very low profitability indicator. The 
transportation industry has both the largest share of sales in 
the machine-building industry and the highest deficit of gross 
and net sales. 
  -  Enterprises with the highest employment are often 
deficit operations; this may be, on the one hand, a brake on 
restructuring, while, on the other, indicate the necessity of 
such action. 
  -  Enterprises of the machine-building industry on the 
500 List incur on balance a total net loss of Z8.5 trillion. The 
profits of the 98 profitable enterprises are thus negated in the 
context of the 36 unprofitable enterprises. In this sense, the 
situation worsened in 1992 in comparison with that in 1991. 
  -  At 
the same time, the link between the level of deficit and the 
amount of dividends and popiwek paid is clear. It is not 
uncommon that an enterprise earns a gross profit, which, after 
the payment of income tax, in insufficient to pay dividends and 
the popiwek; the enterprise thus enters the loss column. This is 
so for 10 of the enterprises with a gross profit. 
  -  Many of the 
enterprises that are least profitable are also payers of the 
popiwek--for example, most of the shipyards. At the same time, a 
large portion of the enterprises paying dividends and the 
popiwek show large sales. 
  -  One can thus formulate a preliminary 
hypothesis that one of the most important barriers to the 
development of the machine-building industry is the low 
productivity and ineffectiveness of the mechanisms for 
rationalizing employment and pay--above all, the popiwek. 
  -  The 
deficit situation of many enterprises of the machine-building 
industry and that industry's great technical and personnel 
potential demands careful preparation and implementation of 
complex programs of restructuring.

<F P=106> [Article by mak.: "Favorable Signals"] </F>
  [Text] Early this year, the indicators of industrial 
output, labor productivity, and exports have been favorable. 
Such is the conclusion from the findings of polls conducted by 
CUP [Central Planning Office] at 133 industrial, construction, 
and commercial enterprises, both public and private, and at 39 
bank branches. To be sure, this cannot be the basis for 
evaluating the entire economy, but it may be that general trends 
are similar. 
  Since December, the proportion of enterprises at which 
output 
has been rising remained the same at 30 percent. A most 
important fact is the 9-percent decline in February, compared 
with January, in the number of enterprises at which output fell. 
The rapid decline in unemployment has been halted. The decline 
in exports has been halted after three months of a steady 
decrease. More than one-half of the enterprises reported that 
the demand for their products is close to their productive 
capacities. The respondents to CUP's polls also expected the 
favorable trends to persist in March. 
  At more than 70 percent of the polled enterprises, average 
wage did not change, while at 30 percent (that is, fewer, 
compared with 35 percent in December) the "popiwek" [tax on wage 
increases] was paid. In February, 26 percent of the enterprises 
(compared with 26 percent in January and 21 percent in December) 
raised the prices of their products and services. Fewer than 1 
percent of the enterprises reported price reductions. Prices are 
rising because of the rising costs of raw materials, energy, and 
producer goods. 
<H5>  In Industry </H5>
  In February, output rose at 30 percent of the polled 
enterprises and declined at 31 percent. These proportions are 
better than in the previous months and, most importantly, the 
forecasts for March are favorable. Forty-one percent of the 
enterprises anticipate an increase in output, and only 4 percent 
expect a decrease. Despite these improved prospects, it was 
pointed out that reasons for restricting output remain numerous. 
At many plants, the output level is unstable, and output 
planning is for periods not longer than six months. 
  However, numerous instances prove that enterprises are 
exploring ways of extricating themselves from their problems. 
Marketing, the application of new technologies, restructuring, 
and organizational changes generally produce favorable results. 
It would be worthwhile to consider these instances. 
  The Amino Plant in Poznan is part of the U.S. concern CPC 
operating 116 plants in 52 countries. Following modernization 
and the introduction of new licenses, the products of the Polish 
factory successfully withstand competition with Western 
products. The Automotive Electronics Plant in Elk (branch of the 
Warsaw FSO Passenger Car Factory) exports one-half of its 
output. It manufactures wiring (electrical, brake cable, etc.) 
for various makes of cars, such as Mercedes-Benz, GM, Fiat, and 
Peugeot. The Herbapol Plant in Lublin is benefiting from the 
growing interest in herbs, syrups, herb medicines, and herb 
teas. A new shift was added, along with 40 new jobs, and 
employment rose to 500. 
  But, as the questionnaires show, the situation is not as 
favorable everywhere. Many enterprises and even entire branches 
and subsectors face huge problems with maintaining production. 
This chiefly concerns the arms plants. Their workforces are 
demanding bigger orders from the Defense Ministry, funds for 
restructuring, a halt to the placement of orders with foreign 
suppliers for those armament components that can be produced in 
this country, and social protection. The dispute betwee the 
Defense Ministry and the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant 
about the Iryda aircraft threatens a decline of the aviation 
industry. 
  The situation of the entire shipyard industry is 
deteriorating. The cutbacks in production at Gdansk Shipyard 
Incorporated directly affect its principal engine 
suppliers--that is, the Cegielski Plant in Poznan and Zgoda in 
Swietochlowice. It is believed that, although the crisis of the 
shipping industry worldwide is passing, the expensive products 
of the debt-laden Polish shipyards are not likely to find buyers. 
<H5>  In Foreign Trade </H5>
  Following three months of steady decline, in February the 
proportion of enterprises whose exports increased rose (from 24 
percent in January) to 44 percent in February. Similarly, there 
was a decrease in the number of enterprises at which exports 
dropped. For March, a decline in exports is anticipated at only 
6 percent of enterprises, and at 54 percent the existing level 
of exports will be maintained. In the opinion of the 
enterprises, exports will stabilize because the contracts 
concluded for 1994 will be implemented. 
  Many producers are striving to conclude long-term trade 
contracts. For example, the Widzew Wifama Machinery Plant is 
negotiating a four-year contract with Iran. The Plock Mostostal 
Steel Bridge Structures Plant has long-term [construction] 
contracts in Africa and the Middle East. Cooperation and mutual 
trade are growing in the border provinces of Poland. Slovakia 
has agreed to restore border traffic based on personal identity 
documents. Although border crossings are being modernized and 
new ones added, the widespread opinion is that they are still 
too few. Moreover, the absence of superhighways, harbor 
transloading terminals, and ferry bases clearly hobbles foreign 
trade. 
  In the opinion of those responding to the CUP poll, the 
transit of goods across Poland in all directions should become 
one of the foundations of our economic strategy. For example, 
the expansion of the Gdynia seaport and the [construction of 
the] North-South Trans-European Highway would serve to absorb 
transit traffic from Scandinavia to the Middle East. In 
addition, a project for laying a broad-gauge railroad line from 
the Belarus border to the seaports of the Gdynia-Gdansk-Sopot 
Tricity is being considered. For the time being, however, the 
planning of highway construction is limited by the lack of funds 
needed for preliminary work and the acquisition of land. Greater 
interest is shown on the regional scale; for example, a 
consortium for building the East-West Highway was formed in 
Wielkopolska. 
<H5>  On the Job Market </H5>
  In February, employment declined at 22 percent of the 
enterprises polled. In March, it is expected to decline at only 
11.5 percent and to increase at 6 percent. An adequate level of 
employment was reported by 64 percent of the enterprises, an 
excessive level by 32 percent, and an insufficient level by 4 
percent. Following an initial period of restructuring and 
cutbacks in employment, the enterprises are beginning to expand, 
explore new markets, and hire needed experts. 
  The pattern of the ownership structure at enterprises 
subject 
to voivodes [province governors] is steadily changing. In Leszno 
Voivodship, one-half of 56 such enterprises became privatized 
(chiefly through a leasing procedure), in Bydgoszcz Voivodship 
22 plants, and in Torun Voivodship 27. In Lodz Voivodship, 
ownership transformations in the past four years extended to 110 
plants, of which 80 percent became employee-owned companies. 
This undermines the notion that state assets are being sold out 
to foreign investors. However, such investors did participate in 
successful privatization projects such as those concerning the 
Dresso Knitwear Factory, the Lodz Papermaking Plant, the Pabia 
ZPO, Elta, and Wizamet. 
  In some cases, the decision to privatize has met with 
protest 
and resistance from trade unions and workforces, as, for 
example, at the Szczecin Shipyard, the Ozarow Cement Plant, and 
the Tobacco Factory in Krakow. Disputes in such controversial 
cases are delaying privatization.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Laszlo </F>
Fabian; place and date not given: "What We Did Is the Future!"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fabian] Mr. Boross, one 
cannot rule out the possibility that the left will come to power 
after the elections. How stable would such a government be and 
how much time would it be able to survive? 
  [Boross] In principle, we must take every possibility into 
account, but I hope only in principle. There are also 
differences. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] will not find 
such an easy ally as that one found by the Polish socialists. 
The MSZP will have a lot of problems if it wins, because the 
phase of unpopular measures has not yet come to an end. The 
Socialists will also have to take unpopular measures, just as we 
did; otherwise, they will cause big problems for themselves and 
the country as well. If they were more cautious with their 
promises and abstained from empty political cliches, their 
advance would perhaps not be so alarming. It is not the current 
situation, but the prospects for the future that concern me. At 
the same time, it is extremely important to preserve democratic 
values, and this requires elections. Free elections are the 
determining basis of democracy. We must accept the fact that 
some people might not understand the historic steps that have 
taken place now. 
  [Fabian] In your opinion, what are the chances of 
cooperation between the Christian national forces? 
  [Boross] If I think of historical analogies, I am 
pessimistic. The meeting in Szarszo was convened with similar 
slogans; nevertheless, it mostly turned into an excluding 
meeting. They excluded the major forces of the Christian 
national trend. I think that those who are now declaring a 
program have spoiled something. This is quite painful. It is 
unfortunate that there are people among those who represent one 
trend who come up with bad formulations and make dangerous 
formulations from both the international and domestic point of 
view. Their formulations are risky. Strong attacks have begun 
from within, and the situation is depressing. I must ask where 
Jozsef Torgyan belongs, whose activity leads to the fact that he 
cannot keep any one of his promises, because he made himself 
unable to join a coalition. Therefore, no matter what he says, 
the audience must know that nothing will come out of it because 
he does not have the power to carry this out; no one will form 
an alliance with him. I do not have rosy hopes regarding any 
collaboration; instead, I feel a division. This is the real 
risk. We know that the left will subordinate everything to its 
desire to return to power. [passage omitted] 
  [Fabian] Political analysts say that two cycles represent 
the "wearing out time" of a government in a democracy. This can 
even be shorter under certain circumstances, as in the case of a 
change in the regime. Are there any resources left for a new 
government cycle? 
  [Boross] Regarding its personnel, a government automatically 
undergoes changes in the first cycle. A government can become 
worn out by its own awkwardness or by a discrediting campaign 
like the one we have experienced in the past four years. Here 
we should take a look back to what this country was like in 1990 
and how it is now, regarding property relations, administration, 
legal independence, constitutional order, and international 
relations. We can say that this government has not become worn 
out, because it has actually created the conditions for economic 
progress under normal and humane circumstances. Fortunately, 
there are similar governments in major Western European 
countries. Therefore, our foreign contacts are rather positive. 
As a propaganda ploy, one can say that the government has 
reached the point when it has to be replaced, but a sober 
observer looks at what would happen to this country if a change 
in direction took place immediately after four years. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Fabian] How is Antall's heritage present in today's 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]? 
  [Boross] It is strongly present, and it is a very good 
feeling for me. His personality was suitable for remembering 
him in a theatrical way, but this is not what happened. Antall 
is present inside the party, at meetings when there is a need to 
quote him. This MDF will advance together with Jozsef Antall's 
ideas. 
  [Fabian] If the MDF is again in the position to form a 
government after the elections, what partners can it count on? 
  [Boross] First of all, the Christian Democratic People's 
Party is our natural ally. The United Smallholders' Party could 
also be another ally, a party that has governing successes and, 
with its seriousness, it might be able to win over the sympathy 
of village smallholders.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Party Views on Hungary's NATO </F>
Membership -- Do You Approve of Hungary's NATO Membership 
Request? If You Do, When Will This Issue Be Timely, and Which 
Forum Should Decide on Entering It?"] 
  [Text] Gyula Thurmer, Workers' Party: The 
Workers' Party does not approve of Hungary's membership in NATO; 
in fact, it opposes it in any form. In Parliament, we will 
propose that Hungary leave the Partnership for Peace program and 
send home the AWACS planes and all foreign soldiers who are 
stationed in Hungary. The NATO issue will have to be taken to a 
referendum immediately after the May elections. 
  Zsolt Rajkai, United Smallholders Party: We 
approve of Hungary's intention of gaining NATO membership. Our 
NATO membership is a timely issue already now. Hungary's 
sovereignty has two possibilities, either neutrality or 
membership in a military bloc. Obviously, it is not enough for a 
country to declare its neutrality; worldwide guarantees are also 
needed for this. However, this is not a well-founded hope. 
Therefore, it is our vital interest to belong to a military 
bloc. At the same time, we would consider a pan- European 
military cooperation agreement ideal. In addition to NATO 
membership, our efforts are directed toward this. 
  Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ]: For the SZDSZ, Hungary's NATO membership is a 
strategic goal. It is our vital interest to integrate ourselves 
organically in the European and Euro-Atlantic organizations. 
NATO is not exclusively a defense organization, it is also a 
forum for security policy and foreign policy coordination. Our 
membership is also important for the reason that, in addition to 
the European member states, it also ensures links with the 
United States and Canada. 
  A period of preparations is needed for full membership and 
the Partnership for Peace program is a good opportunity for 
this. We would like to achieve full membership in a few years' 
time. 
  We do not think a referendum on our membership is vitally 
important; however, we will not reject it if there is a broad 
demand for this in society. 
  Lajos Horvath, Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP]: Yes, the MIEP approves of Hungary's request for 
NATO membership. This would bring significant political, 
economic, and military advantages for Hungary. It would mean a 
much quicker access to the various orgnizations of the world, 
and the extension of the NATO umbrella over Hungary. Due to 
Hungary's economic and military political situation, all these 
are clearly needed. At the same time, we have to recognize the 
fact that NATO membership would have all kinds of consequences, 
and meeting the various requirements would entail much sacrifice 
from the people. For this reason, only a referendum can decide 
this issue. The time: as soon as possible. However, full 
membership is only a desirable goal at the moment, and before 
this can be achieved, we have to concentrate on building a 
strong economy and a combat-worthy army. 
  Ferenc Inotay, Christian Democratic People's 
Party: 
  1. I approve of and agree with Hungary's membership in NATO. 
Effectively, Hungary's security is not guaranteed by anything 
other than a promise to help, on the level of sympathy. Our 
NATO membership will document the 1,000-year-old fact that 
Hungary is part of the Western Christian world. For the peoples 
of the Carpathian basin, NATO membership will result in reducing 
tensions (that have been simmering underground since the end of 
World War I), and in creating peace in the minds of people of 
various native languages and nationalities. NATO membership 
will also ensure technical development for Hungary both in the 
military and in the civilian production spheres. 
  2. To the timeliness, my answer is that it would have 
already been good yesterday, but today is not too late, either. 
NATO membership is not attractive for the remaining domestic 
leadership or that in the neighboring countries which was 
brought up on Soviet world-dominating ideas; therefore, these 
leaders do all they can to delay it as much as possible or 
cancel it altogether. It is also urgent to achieve NATO 
membership to nullify this influence and make it impossible. 
The revival of the imperial and power attitude in Russia, which 
endangers us as well as NATO, can speed up the approval of our 
NATO membership and can make it cheaper. Due to our 
geopolitical situation, our membership will also be in the 
interest of NATO. If we cannot bear the financial burdens of an 
early NATO membership, NATO might take on these financial 
burdens in the form of aid, and turn it into the financing of a 
NATO interest, which will make this more likely. 
  3. Hungary's NATO membership is a decision of great 
importance and a commitment that will determine our future for a 
long time; therefore, it can only be decided in a general 
referendum. 
  Szabolcs Baross, Republic Party: At the moment, 
all European and transatlantic organizations and institutions 
are in a state of flux. For us, there is no alternative to the 
European Community as an economic integration. However, in the 
view of the Republic Party, out of the security policy 
organizations -- NATO and the Western European Union -- it would 
be too soon to institutionalize our contacts with either of 
them. Rather, we should concentrate on establishing our ability 
as soon as possible to link to the already existing 
organizations and the possibly emerging new cooperations. 
  In our view, membership in the big integrations is a major 
issue that requires a referendum. 
  Zoltan Kiraly, Social Democratic Party of Hungary: 
For the country's security, the most important task is to 
improve and deepen the economic, political, and cultural links 
with the neighboring countries and the states of the 
Central-Eastern European region in a broader sense, and where 
this is not possible, continuously to handle the conflict. 
  In our view, relations with NATO are an important element of 
Hungarian security policy, but we reject all such attempts that 
would suggest the shifting of responsibility to somewhere else, 
in other words, attempts that "seek protection from others" 
instead of trying to solve the undoubtedly complicated problems. 
  It is timely to establish political and professional 
contacts 
with NATO, but not membership. A referendum will have to decide 
on membership.

<F P=106> ["G.Z."-signed interview with Zoltan Kiraly, chairman of the </F>
Hungarian Social Democratic Party; place and date not given: 
"We Speak of Accepting Government Obligations More Emphatically 
Than Anyone Else"] 
  [Text] Our elections series interviews the leaders of 
parties that have presented a national list on their programs 
and ideas. Today, we interview Zoltan Kiraly, head of the list 
of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party [MSZDP]. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Perhaps one of the clearest characteristics 
of the MSZDP program is the extending of the government's role 
and responsibility to welfare areas. With the approach of the 
elections, many big parties are also trying to obtain votes by 
promising more social care. 
  [Kiraly] Indeed, social democratic values are also present 
in the programs of almost every political party. Even the major 
political forces in Hungary cannot avoid speaking against 
poverty, the steady deterioration of the real value of pensions, 
and unemployment. However, I do not see anything bad in this. 
I think that the more people speak of social democratic values, 
equal chances and justice, the more can be implemented. 
However, all these values appear in the MSZDP program much more 
markedly. In the struggle against unemployment, we would like 
to implement a policy of state investment protection that does 
not only rely on the development of market requirements and the 
good intentions of the entrepreneurs in creating new jobs. This 
policy also tries to create jobs by means of large-scale state 
investment. Our program speaks more markedly than any other 
about government responsibility to maintain the real value of 
basic pensions by adjusting them to inflation and providing 
state guarantees. We believe that education should be free of 
charge, from elementary school to college and university 
education. It is the obligation of the state to provide the 
fullest possible equality of chances in this area. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] How would the MSZDP find funds for all this? 
  [Kiraly] The spreading of the welfare network requires much 
greater efforts and financial resources than many people 
thought. It has become clear now that the present government 
policy can no longer continue, namely increasing value added 
tax, income tax, and social security payments. We firmly claim, 
and we are not alone in this, that a review of Hungary's debt 
repayment has become inevitable. Negotiations must be initiated 
with the World Bank, the IMF, and representatives of governments 
affected by our debts. We succeeded in getting some kind of a 
debt repayment delay at the end of the 1980's. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] You repeatedly criticized this government's 
privatization efforts. Actually, do you have reservations about 
the allegedly mistaken privatization process, or is the 
privatization itself unacceptable for the Social Democrats? 
  [Kiraly] There are considerable differences between our 
program and those of other parties regarding the change of 
property. We are interested in a broad change of property. In 
our view, this process has a moral part and also one that points 
to the future, one that provides the foundations of a bourgeois 
society. Privatization cannot be limited to even 1 million 
citizens. Privatization should affect broader social strata. 
Millions of employees and pensioners would like to get to at 
least 60 percent of the state property in one way or another, 
and the remaining 40 percent could go to local government 
bodies, universities, and colleges. It is possible to find a 
way to assert the principles of fairness and justice. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The coming elections will have a major 
effect on the future of social democracy in Hungary. 
  [Kiraly] If we can make it into Parliament in any form, we 
are already on the first step on the road leading there. I am 
convinced that our presence in Parliament will provide a stable 
point for the MSZDP in the political arena on which the party 
can rely. In the four years ahead of us, it is possible to lay 
the foundations for this party to have a chance of governing 
since the 1988 elections.

  [Excerpts] In constituencies where the Social Democratic 
Party of Hungary [MSZDP] has not put forward its own candidates, 
it is going to support the Hungarian Socialist Party. Edit 
Schranz reports: 
  [Schranz] The MSZDP wants to establish a strong left wing in 
Hungary. Without a strong left wing, serious decisions cannot 
be made in parliament. Moreover, should the occasion arise, a 
strong left wing is needed to govern the country, party Chairman 
Zoltan Kiraly said. [passage omitted] 
  The MSZDP is planning to make a decision on where and with 
whom to conclude election agreements in the second round of the 
elections at its presidium meeting to be held on 14 May. In 
connection with this, Zoltan Kiraly also revealed that, with the 
exception of left and right extremists, they might conclude 
election agreements with other parties, including liberal 
parties. For that matter, the party asks the voters to vote for 
the Socialists' list in constituencies where the MSZDP does not 
have a party list in the first round, the chairman said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, former finance minister and </F>
economic expert of the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Katalin 
Bossanyi; place and date not given: "We Cannot Allow Ourselves 
To Make Baseless Promises -- Laszlo Bekesi on Crisis Management, 
Reform of State Finances, and Wage Compensation"] 
  [Text] According to Bekesi, the Socialists are in a unique 
position in the election campaign because they cannot allow 
themselves to gain votes through unfounded promises. The 
Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] program is basically 
pragmatic and concentrates on handling the crisis. Bekesi 
thinks that he will not participate in implementing his program 
if he does not get support for it within his party and from the 
potential coalition partners, because for him, stabilizing the 
economy is the important issue, rather than personal and 
prestige consideration. I interviewed him on the details of the 
oft-mentioned reform of state finances, among other things. 
  [Bossanyi] We can witness a peculiar war of numbers: The 
opposition parties -- including the MSZP -- are claiming, 
supported by figures, that the country is in a worse economic 
situation than in 1990. However, the government parties claim 
that two different periods cannot be compared. What are your 
views on this? 
  [Bekesi] In my view, the two periods cannot indeed very well 
be compared to each other due to the character of the changeover 
to a market economy. However, it can be assessed what kind of 
room for maneuver the government is leaving its successor in the 
area of economic policy, at that time and now, and to what 
extent it is trying to depict the state of the economy as being 
better than it is. The three main arguments of the government's 
propaganda of success that can be observed are the following: 
"We are past the worst because industrial production is 
increasing, unemployment is decreasing, and we have high foreign 
currency reserves." 
  [Bossanyi] Are these statistical facts? 
  [Bekesi] These are facts that cannot be interpreted removed 
from the economic environment, and they are only really suitable 
for manipulating the public. Together with the increase in 
industrial output, it has to be known that this is mainly a 
delayed effect of the forced exports of 1992. On the other 
hand, the state is heavily overspending, which indeed creates 
more domestic demand, but also leads to an even more upset 
balance. As for unemployment, the proportion of people without 
work is much higher than the registered level, and an increasing 
number of people are leaving the unemployment benefit system, 
which lays an extra burden on welfare policy. The fact that, 
along with this high level of unemployment, productivity has 
actually decreased in industry and agriculture in the past four 
years is one of the biggest traps. In the case of the 7 billion 
[currency not specified] foreign currency reserve, it has to be 
remembered that this is the central bank's, rather than the 
government's, reserve. It is more than a political misstatement 
to mention this as a reserve that can be used freely. I am not 
disputing that the relatively high level of the reserves has 
some advantages. The central bank has for some time been 
managing the Hungarian debt financing quite well. However, it 
is also part of this that they were perfectly aware that the bad 
balance figures -- which are still bad -- will shake the trust 
of foreign capital, therefore, it will be more difficult to get 
new money. No more agreements should be made with the IMF for 
this year. The new government will have to strive for at least 
two- to three-year financing agreements for its stabilization 
and modernization program. Therefore, the "success indicators" 
do not mean that "we are past the worst." 
  [Bossanyi] To what extent do all these factors determine the 
next government's room for maneuver, whichever government it 
will be? 
  [Bekesi] The fact that the structural change has not been 
implemented increases the social costs of the changes, and 
modernization decisions will have to be made while much fewer 
resources will be at the government's disposal. While society 
is waiting for the distribution of higher amounts and for the 
improvement of living standards, we have to introduce an 
economic policy based on accumulation and savings. If the 
conditions for modernization are not established then we will 
not have growth, either. That is why I am stating that the 
starting position is worse in 1994 than it was in 1990. 
According to my calculations, the 1993 trend will be continued 
and as much as 40 percent of the budget deficit will have to be 
financed from foreign resources. It is a further burden that 
while in 1990, the cost of debt servicing did not reach 8 
percent in the budget, it will be 21 percent in 1994 and 25 
percent in 1995. The value of the annual interest rate increase 
is 80 billion [currency not specified], which can destroy the 
budget. 
  [Bossanyi] The government has been continuously easing its 
monetary policy since 1992 while the range and level of state 
obligations has been increasing. How big is this legacy and 
what can the next government do with it? 
  [Bekesi] These are obligations that can be measured in 
assets, forints, and foreign currency. The first is the 
unfinished compensation, which is an almost 300 billion 
[currency not specified] state obligation that is to come out of 
the state assets. Although the Socialists have not agreed with 
the compensation laws from the beginning, guaranteeing legal 
security and strengthening the citizens' trust are decisive 
factors for us in this issue. Therefore, if we come into a 
decision-making position, we will continue to meet the 
obligations affecting the assets. This is in spite of the fact 
that we know that this damages the conditions of market 
privatizations, lowers the [share] prices, and has an 
inflationary effect that cannot be neglected. However, we will 
not start new compensation. 
  [Bossanyi] Providing the large self-governing bodies with 
assets is also a pending issue. 
  [Bekesi] The social security obviously will not be able to 
receive majority shares -- these have to be left to the 
professional investors -- only minority ones that also have 
dividends. However, it will be difficult to find the financing 
for this from the current state assets. At the same time, the 
reform of health care and pensions cannot be implemented without 
this, and even the reform of state finances cannot be started. 
All these indicate what kind of restraints the asset management 
practice of the predecessors can create. 
  [Bossanyi] Do you also see debtor consolidation as an 
obligation that is forced to be continued? 
  [Bekesi] The new government will have to make a snapshot 
inventory because it will not otherwise be able to make 
decisions. The costs of consolidation can range from 300 to 600 
billion [currency not specified]. According to unconfirmed 
figures, more than 120 billion in state guarantees also have to 
be added to this. And we have not even mentioned the state's 
obligations to the local governments. The state obligations 
calculated in foreign currency -- for example through issuing 
bonds -- also increase the burdens. All these form a 
determination chain that will really appear in the 1995 and 1996 
budgets. I believe that these facts show tangibly that the 
government's scope for maneuver is smaller than it was in 1990. 
  [Bossanyi] According to this, whichever government comes to 
power, it will first have to perform crisis management, whether 
it admits to this during its campaign or not. 
  [Bekesi] Crisis management will have to be the first: The 
negative processes have to be dampened and stopped. However, 
the immediate restoration of the balance is an economic fiction. 
The second step will be strengthening the market institutions 
and deregulation, and the third -- in close relationship with 
the previous factors -- is establishing the conditions for 
lasting economic growth. 
  [Bossanyi] What would be the desirable process of crisis 
management? 
  [Bekesi] Restructuring the state finances -- namely the oft 
mentioned but always postponed reform of the state finances -- 
then completing the process of putting the banking system back 
on its feet, stopping the destruction in the agrarian economy, 
and recapturing some of the lost eastern markets. 
  [Bossanyi] What will be the measures to follow these, which 
will help growth? 
  [Bekesi] For example, these will be the improvement of the 
investment climate, a faster development of infrastructure, and 
the drawing up of a new privatization strategy. 
  [Bossanyi] Let us expand on one element of crisis 
management, the reform of state finances. Everyone keeps 
talking about this but the details are still not clear. 
  [Bekesi] Examining the state expenditure is the first task. 
This is not a slogan. Today, these expenses are many times 
greater than what can be tolerated by the economy, and they 
lastingly lead to the centralization and then redistribution of 
60 percent of the gross domestic product. In the case of the 
undivided expenditure items -- for example, administration, 
defense, and political or prestige spending -- we have to expect 
an absolute cut. It is possible to make savings in a similar 
way in the case of the decentralized funds. The new program to 
be drawn up for managing the debts can also release resources. 
However, among the state expenditure, there is an area whose 
size cannot be touched, namely basic and middle level education, 
healthcare, and welfare policy. Another area -- which is very 
broad, therefore I will only indicate it -- is the one where the 
state and the user of the service have to share the burden of 
financing. These areas can be culture, higher education, 
sciences, sports, town development, and sewage and similar 
services in towns. The division of these costs will depend on 
economic development and on interest coordination in society. 
The third area is the one from where the state has to withdraw 
and the market demand has to decide whether these services are 
needed. I would include many functions of authorities here. 
  [Bossanyi] Would this mean that there will be less money for 
health care or welfare benefits? 
  [Bekesi] In the welfare sphere, the examination of the 
expenditure does not in itself mean the reduction of expenses, 
but it means a system of financing that is different from the 
current one. This can be achieved partly through expanding the 
insurance methods, and through basing the benefits on needs, 
rather than on fairness. It is very important to reconsider the 
role of the state and, on the other hand, the civic 
organizations, charitable organizations, and churches in 
financing these areas. They participate in education, health 
care, and welfare care; the question is what, out of these, can 
be placed on an entrepreneurial basis, and what can be financed 
by public funds. To achieve this, we will also need a good law 
on nonprofit organizations. 
  [Bossanyi] All this means that the reform measures can -- 
temporarily -- reduce living standards. According to your 
calculations, to what extent? 
  [Bekesi] We are calculating with a three-year reform 
concept. This can mean a 4 to 5 percent reduction in public 
consumption and in net incomes, out of which 50 percent has to 
be compensated for. My view is that, in basic provisions, all of 
the lost amounts have to be returned to the affected areas, for 
example in the form of pension increase, a welfare benefit 
increase, or family supplement increase. In the case of active 
workers, this will be up to a certain level of income. 
  [Bossanyi] From what will you finance all this? 
  [Bekesi] From reducing the other state expenditure. 
Therefore, only 40 to 50 percent can be saved from the program 
to reduce the expenditure. 
  [Bossanyi] Is the social pact enough for this? 
  [Bekesi] Not in itself. We need a coalition government with 
a large majority that will support this program at the outset 
and will carry it through consistently to the end. 
  [Bossanyi] What will guarantee to the social partners that 
the government will adhere to the agreement? 
  [Bekesi] Partly, the new system of interest coordination. 
In my view, the various reform measures must not be taken to 
parliament until the agreement on the social pact is achieved. 
  [Bossanyi] When your concept is criticized -- even within 
your party -- the usual argument is that it is too restrictive, 
it only concentrates on the balance and does not sufficiently 
take society's ability to accept this into consideration. In 
fact, it is also said that this economic policy program is not 
typical of a socialist-social democratic party. 
  [Bekesi] I believe that the Socialists are in a unique 
position among the parties running in the elections: We cannot 
allow ourselves to gain votes with unfounded promises. As for 
the program that I drew up, indeed it is usually called 
social-liberal. In my view, in these days, there is no point in 
putting ideological labels on crisis management. We need 
pragmatic programs that can be implemented. It is true that a 
softer program could also be drawn up, but the sad truth is that 
it would not achieve the goal. Without restoring the balance and 
without stabilization we will not have growth. Anyone who is 
trying to tackle the problems in the opposite order -- whether 
through a complete or a half turn -- is deceiving himself and 
society. If we cannot stop the deterioration of the balance 
then we will face payment problems at the end of 1995 that would 
lead to a dramatic decline. If the deficit continues to 
increase in proportion to the GDP then a galloping inflation 
will be the result. Let us be clear: Both negative processes 
can be stopped. However, not through growth promises as it is 
being done by the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the Federation 
of Young Democrats. 
  [Bossanyi] Does this also mean that you will not sign your 
name to the program if the crisis management is not started in 
the order you consider professionally justified? 
  [Bekesi] For me, the possibility to implement this program 
is not a personal or prestige issue. I am convinced that I have 
suggested the economically most rational solution and precisely 
because of the narrow roads, I cannot see any other feasible 
way. Therefore, if I do not receive support for this within the 
party or, in a given situation, from the coalition partners, 
then I will not attempt to implement it. Not because of the 
possible professional failure, but because I do not wish to 
participate in forming an economic policy -- neither actively, 
nor as an accomplice, watching from the sidelines -- that might 
ring nicer in the ears of the electors but causes the 
deterioration of the economy and of the situation of the whole 
society in the long run.

<F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer by </F>
Gabor Moricz; place and date not given: "We Are Following Our 
Own Road"] 
  [Text] There is a political party in Hungary today that is 
not one of the many parties, but a single such party. However, 
this party is no longer that party. This party cannot be called 
"the party." This is only a party that can make it into 
Parliament if it is successful in the elections. It seems that 
it has all the chances to make it into Parliament. We spoke 
about this with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer. 
  [Moricz] Only 0.32 percent separated your party from 
parliamentary membership in the 1990 elections. If you had 
presented a Pest county list at the time, you would have made it 
into Parliament. Now, you have presented 156 individual 
candidates and you also have all the district lists. What 
percentage are you counting on at the elections? 
  [Thurmer] Even on the basis of mathematical logic, one can 
presume that the Workers Party will make it into Parliament. 
With a realistic optimism, I am hoping for 7-8 percent of the 
votes. 
  [Moricz] You mentioned 5 percent in February. Does that 
mean there has been an increase in support for the Workers Party? 
  [Thurmer] There is definitely an increase in support for our 
party. We hope to be successful in the first round. I think we 
can justifiably hope for 5-8 percent of the votes; of course, 
miracles can also happen. 
<H5>  A Formal Freedom of the Press </H5>
  [Moricz] According to a survey carried out by the Szonda 
Ipsos in January this year, 8 percent of the people surveyed 
thought that Gyula Thurmer was the chairman of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP].... 
  [Thurmer] I suspect the pollers are not so much interested 
in the people's opinions; they are much more interested in 
influencing them. Fortunately, the pollers themselves refrain 
from suggesting that the Workers Party will not make it into 
Parliament. Thanks to the brainwashing carried out by the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], freedom of the press in 
Hungary is only formally present. We are only beginning to 
receive the amount of radio and television time we deserve now 
on the eve of the elections. 
  [Moricz] So you do not accept the fact that many of your 
voters do not even know whom to vote for. 
  [Thurmer] That is possible, but these people mostly vote for 
the left; at most, they hesitate between the MSZP and the 
Workers Party. 
  [Moricz] In your opinion, what is the difference between 
these two parties? 
  [Thurmer] The MSZP accepts capitalism, while the Workers 
Party does not. I also welcome the success of the MSZP. 
  [Moricz] On your visit to Salgotarjan in connection with the 
news of the arrest of two former policemen, you again called for 
a halt on political trials and for immunity to the future 
deputies. Does that mean that there are former members of the 
III/III department and former policemen among you? 
  [Thurmer] This is not the point. There is no sense in 
political trials because their goal is to threaten people and 
show power. Instead of the district commissioner, a 15-20 
member action group took an unfortunate pensioner in Nograd to 
the police, although he would have gone to the police alone. 
  [Moricz] In other words, you agree with the moral 
administration of justice and you only disagree with its 
implementation. 
  [Thurmer] No, I do not agree with this. The law on the 
administration of justice itself is bad. The issue of the 1956 
uprising should be left alone because no justice can be done 
here. There were two sides on the barricades, and the one who 
stood on one side of the barricade will never see events the way 
the one who stood on the other side sees them. As for the 
members of the III/III department and the former police, they 
are not among us but among the deputies of parliamentary parties. 
  [Moricz] You often said that the Kadar regime was more 
honest and better than the current one. What is your opinion on 
Kadar's declaration in the course of the retaliations following 
the 1956 revolution, according to which the 
counterrevolutionaries should be hanged en masse. 
  [Thurmer] I do not know whether Janos Kadar said this. 
  [Moricz] There are written documents attesting to this, 
Hungarian Television presented these documents, and one can read 
them in the report of the Kahler committee. 
  [Thurmer] The Kahler committee is not a source for me. 
  [Moricz] A protocol was prepared on this declaration. 
  [Thurmer] This has no importance today. Obviously, many 
people said many things about 1956 at the time. We should not 
deal with this. I do not understand the timeliness of this 
issue. After 38 years, why is it interesting for MAGYAR NEMZET 
to ask the chairman of a party about what the chairman of a 
former party said? 
  [Moricz] Because the chairman of this party said the Kadar 
regime was more honest and better than the current regime. 
  [Thurmer] I continue to claim that the Kadar regime was more 
honest and better. This does not depend on a quotation but on 
the way people lived then. 
  [Moricz] A considerable number of people fled the country 
and many people were imprisoned. 
  [Thurmer] That is not true. The Kadar regime gave most 
people more and better chances than the current regime. 
  [Moricz] In other words, the Workers Party is conducting a 
policy that does not take into consideration how certain parts 
of society are living. 
  [Thurmer] This is more characteristic of the current regime. 
We do not want to repeat Kadar's policy, but the results 
achieved in the past decades must be preserved. 
<H5>  Yes to Socialism </H5>
  [Moricz] One of the pet subjects of the Workers Party is 
that it does not want the Boross-type Christian national 
capitalism, or the Horn-Nagy-Bekesi-type of rose capitalism, or 
Kuncze's liberal capitalists either. At the same time, your 
party says that Sandor Nagy is only a rival and not an enemy, 
and the party has signed an agreement with Nagy's National 
Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ]. 
  [Thurmer] We signed an agreement with the workers' platform 
of the MSZOSZ, and not with Sandor Nagy. The fact that such a 
platform could emerge shows that there are many left-wing people 
in the trade unions who are seeking the policy of the Workers 
Party. We do not want any type of capitalism. 
  [Moricz] Is socialism your distant goal? 
  [Thurmer] Of course. 
  [Moricz] However, you said you were not in favor of 
restoration. 
  [Thurmer] When socialism is created in Hungary, this will be 
a historical progress, rather than restoration. 
  [Moricz] You nevertheless supported the forces representing 
the restoration of the old regime during the coup attempt in 
Russia. 
  [Thurmer] I do not know whether these forces supported 
restoration. On thing is certain: Even the U.S. President 
would pray for the united Soviet Union that we too support, but 
it is too late. 
  [Moricz] You said earlier that joining the Partnership for 
Peace program would have Hungary drifting into the Yugoslav 
conflict. Do you continue to believe this now that Hungary has 
joined the program and after meeting President Milosevic? 
  [Thurmer] Hungary does not have to drift into the Yugoslav 
conflict: We are already in it. We take part in the economic 
sanctions directed against Yugoslavia. The Hungarian Government 
also rejected the latest idea of the Romanian, Greek, and 
Bulgarian governments to lift the sanctions. Except for its 
steps coordinated with the West, the Hungarian Government has 
not taken any individual foreign policy initiatives. This is 
the policy of the last ally, and this has never led to anything 
positive in Hungarian history. 
<H5>  Hypocritical Law </H5>
  [Moricz] To the disapproval of the West, Peter Boross 
demanded that AWACS aircraft refrain from directing military 
attacks from Hungarian airspace. 
  [Thurmer] Peter Boross' declaration had no importance 
whatsoever, because it is not the Hungarian Government that 
decides on the deployment of these aircraft. Besides, the 
positive things achieved in Hungarian-Yugoslav relations are 
being spoiled on the other side: [Foreign Minister Geza] 
Jeszenszky goes to Belgrade, but one month later he celebrates 
the anniversary of 15 March in Vojvodina, and he also takes 
short trips to Bosnia and Croatia. 
  [Moricz] Does that mean that one should not go to Vojvodina 
after Belgrade? 
  [Thurmer] After Belgrade yes, but not on a separate 
occasion, and not on 15 March, and particularly not on this 15 
March. The ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders should 
not be involved in the election campaign. The question is much 
more complex. The Hungarians are able to celebrate the 
anniversary of 15 March perfectly without Mr. Jeszenszky. 
  [Moricz] You also criticize this government's national 
minority policy within our borders. You recently apologized to 
the national minorities in Hungary for this government's 
mistakes. You claim that this government's national minority 
policy is bad because it encourages the national minorities to 
create efficient organizations. In reality, it wants to hinder 
their unity with this. Do you seriously believe this? 
  [Thurmer] Everything that is good in the situation of 
national minorities in Hungary has already been good so far, and 
the new things are bad. The general situation is worse in areas 
and counties with national minorities. The national minorities 
have more rights in the sense that they can set up 
self-government bodies, but no one knows what will happen to 
these bodies and whether there is the money for them. The law 
is hypocritical from the outset, because the law that was 
eventually adopted is not the one sent to the European 
Parliament. 
  [Moricz] In your opinion, the national minorities also think 
that the Kadar regime was better for them. Did your talks with 
these people convince you of this? 
  [Thurmer] Of course. 
  [Moricz] Whom do you regard as a personal example among the 
major leaders of the workers' movement? 
  [Thurmer] I do not have models. 
  [Moricz] ??? [punctuation as published] 
  [Thurmer] I follow my own road and we follow our own road. 
That is the most reliable one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov by Adam </F>
Cerny; place and date not given: "The Developments in Bosnia 
Make Us Anxious"] 
  [Text] LIDOVE NOVINY asked the Bulgarian foreign minister, 
who will hold talks in the Czech Republic today, several 
questions. 
  [Cerny] Bulgaria is located in the immediate neighborhood of 
the Balkan conflict, and because of historical correlations, it 
is also concerned with the problem of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Could you 
characterize the attitude of your country regarding these two 
topical issues? 
  [Daskalov] The conflict in former Yugoslavia is the most 
complex and the most tragic conflict in Europe since the end of 
World War II. The broad spectrum of the reasons for its 
emergence and the belated activation of the international 
community further complicate the search for a quick solution. 
  The events in former Yugoslavia are projected onto our 
country in more than one respect. The war is close, which means 
a potential threat to the security of Bulgaria. The damages to 
our economy caused by honoring the UN Security Council sanctions 
against Yugoslavia are tremendous. They have surpassed $3.6 
billion since the sanctions were declared. It causes great 
difficulties for Bulgarian foreign trade, telecommunications, 
and transport connections with Central and Western Europe.... 
  It is of vital interest to Bulgaria that the military 
actions 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina are terminated and a permanent peace 
solution is found. As early as the beginning of the conflict, 
we said we would not take part in any form of military 
operations, including peacekeeping operations, in the territory 
of former Yugoslavia, and we appealed to other Balkan countries 
to keep their distance too. In our opinion, a way out of the 
conflict can only be found by the joint efforts of the 
international community: the UN, NATO, the United States, and 
Russia. 
  The most recent development of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina makes us anxious but, at the same time, it 
points out the safest route to the termination of the conflict, 
which is negotiations. Therefore, we welcome the proposal for a 
summit of the representatives of the United States, Russia, and 
the European Union [EU] dedicated to these issues. The summit 
would confirm the readiness of these countries to engage in the 
search for a way out of the crisis. 
  Our country has been demonstrating by all its deeds over the 
past two years that it does not have any territorial claims 
against its neighbors. Bulgaria was the first country in the 
entire world -- already on 15 January 1992 -- to recognize the 
independence of the just-emerged Macedonia. We are interested 
in having the statehood of Macedonia confirmed, in an even more 
determined support for this state from the international 
community. This process and the presence of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] are important steps in preventing the spread 
of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina outside its present 
framework. 
  [Cerny] Traditionally, Bulgaria has always had close 
relations with the Russian state. How do you perceive Russia's 
present position and the new exertion of its influence in the 
Balkans and also its attempts at reviving the pan-Slavic ideas? 
  [Daskalov] I have already answered this question to a 
certain 
degree; we welcome the constructive endeavors of Russian 
diplomacy coordinated with the United States and the EU that 
contribute to finding a peaceful way out of the conflict and 
that is just to all parties involved. As far as the 
contribution and deeds leading towards peace and stability are 
concerned, I believe we can all be satisfied. 
  I would prefer not to comment on the new phenomena in the 
domestic political life in Russia. I would only observe that we 
bear witness to its multifarious tendencies. The development of 
the processes in Russia should be assessed from the vantage 
point of the progress in the democratic and economic reforms, 
but also from the point of view of the complex changes in 
Europe. The integrating and democratizing Europe, whose 
indivisible part are the Central and East European states, can 
provide a natural support for the democratic development in 
Russia. 
  Your question concerning the revival of pan-Slavism is 
interesting already in the fact that the notion of pan-Slavism 
emerged for the first time precisely on Czech soil. 
Nevertheless, in the course of almost one and a half centuries, 
with constantly changing conditions -- sometimes more, sometimes 
less favorable -- it has never achieved substantial progress or 
scope. It is, from this vantage point, a form of utopia. 
  It would be a mistake if we took a nihilistic approach and 
denied the contribution of the Slavic peoples to the European 
culture only because certain extremist politicians utilize it as 
their motto.

  [Text] On 29 April, the Executive Council of the 
Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB] 
adopted a package of urgent measures aimed at overcoming the 
destabilization of the financial system and the crisis in income 
and production. An appendix to the package was adopted which 
demands the government inform the parliament and the trade union 
about commitments to international institutions, which affect 
production in Bulgaria. 
  The Executive Council will convene the KNSB Coordinating 
Council on 9 May. The goal is to report the result of the 
warning strike and national protest rallies, conducted by 6 May, 
to update the assessment of the sociopolitical situation in the 
country, and determine the KNSB attitude toward the government.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sonya Angelova: "Berov Will Call the Tune for </F>
a Few More Months"] 
  [Text] Despite the permanent talk regarding early 
parliamentary elections, the current prime minister can be calm 
about his post for a rather long time. There are at least three 
reasons for this. The rivalry between the president and the 
parliament is just one of them. 
  [President Zhelyu] Zhelev's intensive efforts to fix a 
"suitable" cabinet, or to transfer the power to a caretaker 
cabinet, as well as the readiness of a dozen of politicians 
loyal to Zhelev to head such a cabinet, prompts a large part of 
the deputies to look with suspicion toward the White House [the 
Bulgarian Presidency]. In the past few months, they plan to 
curb the president's prerogatives, and only the unexpected 
illness of the prime minister spoiled their plans. 
  Amending the Bulgarian Constitution, however, is not a 
simple 
job. This is a delicate thing, related to subtle negotiations 
and precise arithmetics because part of the people's deputies 
really fear the long hands of the Presidency. The weakness of 
the head of state, however, to publicly settle the account with 
the Socialists and the rapid disintegration that engulfed the 
camp of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], facilitated 
turning the Presidency into the only significant opponent of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The deformations in political 
life evoked analogies of the time of the Third Kingdom. Most of 
the caretaker cabinets of that time managed to win the elections 
regardless of their platforms. Therefore, the idea of 
increasing control over the president appears to be a task of 
supreme importance. There are two variants of this: either the 
parliament should continue its activity and thus keep an eye on 
the caretaker cabinet conceived by Zhelev, or the parliament 
should be entrusted with the task of forming this cabinet. Both 
variants require several months for their realization. Until 
then, Professor Berov will be protected from various votes. 
  The second reason for his temporary immunity is related to 
the unresolved internal problems of political forces. The SDS 
preserved its coalition character long after similar formations 
in other East European states disintegrated. The deadlock 
between the National Coordinating Council and the parliamentary 
faction, however, prompts the two camp to openly long for 
democratic centralism, the one-man-command, and something that 
resembles party discipline. The issue that preoccupies the SDS 
headquarters more than anything else is who will lead the future 
blue [SDS] party. The final term allocated to Filip Dimitrov and 
Stefan Savov is 15 May. Until now, it appeared that only the 
chief of the parliamentary faction [Stefan Savov] is pressed for 
time. The national conference is expected to be the triumph of 
the apparatus games, and the apparatus is fully controlled by 
Filip Dimitrov. Recently, however, the hardliners also 
demonstrated nervousness. Several times, Edvin Sugarev demanded 
proposing a vote of no-confidence and pressed for adopting a 
decision to walk out of the parliament. The discussions related 
to composing the election lists will accelerate those processes. 
If Filip Dimitrov's plan to propose SDS candidates and 
determine their place in the lists succeeds, the outcome of the 
battle will be determined. The central leadership will close 
its doors to the Democratic and Radical-Democratic Parties, the 
blue Agrarians, and a part of the United Christian Democratic 
Center. Even if Savov himself passes through the sieve, the 
next parliamentary faction will already be totally dominated by 
Filip Dimitrov, while the faction's present leader will become a 
respected but tiresome pensioner. Everyone understands the 
situation. The split in the SDS appears to be a matter of time. 
  The third, and perhaps the most important reason is 
privatization. Preparations for privatization began before 10 
November, and yet it does not seem to materialize. The owners 
of the former national wealth are determined by violence or in a 
Byzantine manner. No one is tempted by the political 
consequences of the privatization. Regardless of the formula 
that will dominate the privatization, there will be 
bankruptcies, people will the thrown into the street, an attempt 
will be made to ban the trade unions, and conflicts will emerge 
among economic groups that divided the country in their 
interest. Diminishing the role of the state produces dividends 
in the long run, however, under the present socioeconomic 
situation, the country could find itself in a catastrophic 
situation in the short run. 
  All this is obvious even from the vintage point of the 
government hospital. Therefore, as a man of character, in the 
near future, Professor Berov will dictate his conditions. For 
the time being, the political forces do not appear to have much 
of a choice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F>
Kaczmarek by Jerzy Sieradzinski; place and date not given: 
"What Do Working People Get From Privatization?"] 
  [Text] [Sieradzinski] Is it not a paradox that, on the eve 
of the May Day holiday, here I am, talking to you, a 
representative of the Polish left wing, about 
privatization--that is to say, about dismantling remnants of the 
old era that displayed a preference for "social ownership of the 
means of production," which, in practical terms, meant a 
ubiquitous domination of state property? 
  [Kaczmarek] I am not sure whether it is a paradox or rather 
a 
certain factual logic in the sense that we, members of the left 
wing, are searching for new possibilities of society's economic 
and civilization-related progress. We want to develop our 
economy in a more cost-efficient, faster, and efficient manner, 
compared with our predecessors. 
  Of course, some people perceive privatization only in the 
black colors of transplanting capitalism, whereas I also see in 
privatization many positive aspects, which, for instance, are 
about social enfranchisement. I am convinced that, if 
privatization is conducted in a reasonable manner and is based 
not on principles of doctrine but on criteria of efficiency, 
such privatization has a very tangibly positive employee aspect. 
  [Sieradzinski] Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has described this 
sort 
of reasoning as "social democrats wearing liberals' pants...." 
  [Kaczmarek] I read his article in POLITYKA, and I must say 
that the author, who, after all was a liberal in his own time, 
stopped developing his views in 1989. In the time that followed, 
my generation of the social-democratic left gained many new 
experiences. We went ahead, and it is hard to accuse us now of 
also having changed our views on the issue of privatization. I 
am convinced that our electorate--and keep in mind that we are a 
party of employees--has also changed its position on 
privatization. It no longer has the hostile or unfriendly 
position that many of us had four or five years ago. 
  The people understand the fact that we have taken it upon 
ourselves to attempt to build an economic and social system that 
will allow us to render Poland part of the European arrangement, 
which will be efficient and competitive and will result in 
monies for the implementation of social programs. In my view, 
that is the entire social democratic concept. Privatization is 
only meant to be an instrument in its implementation. 
  [Sieradzinski] To me, the most important question is this: 
What do people who work in enterprises that were state-owned 
yesterday but that, beginning today, become private property 
stand to gain from this? Do these people not feel like they are 
just an appendix to the entire transaction? 
  [Kaczmarek] This is a fundamental issue to me, as well. 
True, 
the ministry I run implements just a third of ownership 
transformations taking place in Poland, and it would be hard to 
hold me accountable for everything that happens in that field, 
but I can assure you that three things are the most important to 
me: First, that the State Treasury obtain a decent price for 
enterprises being privatized. Second, that the enterprises be 
transferred to good hands, which implies a detailed description 
in the contract of the obligations of the new owner vis-a-vis 
the enterprise, contributing additional capital for investment 
and modernization, securing new markets, and so forth. A third 
very significant element of our privatization contracts is made 
up of social issues. 
  The issue is about guarantees of not carrying out personnel 
cuts in a specified time period, establishing new jobs, 
prospects for salary raises, and observing many other rights 
acquired by employees in the past. 
  I want to stress that this is a specific trait of our 
privatization process. When you look at the eastern provinces of 
Germany, you will see that such contracts do not encompass 
social obligations. The fact that, for instance, the new owner 
of the "San" company in Jaroslaw guarantees the employees that 
there will be no personnel cuts over the next four years--that 
is of enormous significance to those employees. 
  Tell me, can you think of a state-owned company where 
employees have guaranteed employment for at least a year? The 
example I gave you is not an exception. In an overwhelming 
majority of enterprises that were privatized recently, the 
investors took upon themselves an obligation to not make 
personnel reductions, to increase employment, and to raise 
salaries by 20 to 30, or even 50 percent. 
  [Sieradzinski] What if these guarantees turn out to be 
nothing more than a piece of paper? 
  [Kaczmarek] There are penalties contained in contracts for 
failure to meet obligations. In very flagrant cases, it is even 
possible to invalidate the transaction signed. I can assure you 
that we will use all legal means to make sure these provisions 
are observed. 
  [Sieradzinski] You are trying to convince me that employees 
should do nothing but be happy about privatization, but we know 
that that is not actually the case. Take the case of the 
Walbrzych "Porcelana" factory, the Warsaw "Polkolor," or the 
infamous firing of women who happened to be on maternity leave 
when the Compact Car Plant signed a joint-venture agreement with 
Fiat. 
  [Kaczmarek] This confirms the argument that any 
generalizations are dangerous. Employees in Kwidzyn, Jaroslaw, 
the Warsaw "Wedel" company, the Szczecin shipyard, and dozens of 
other companies have a completely different view on benefits 
accrued from privatization. Because they finally have a genuine 
owner instead of a state official exercising ownership 
supervision from high above on behalf of the State Treasury, the 
situation of those enterprises--and the feeling of social 
security of their employees--is incomparably better today than 
before privatization. 
  What also improves is the overall work environment; I mean 
cleanliness and order in working halls or at construction sites. 
Lunchrooms, cloakrooms, and uniforms for employees--they all 
look different now. That also counts. 
  Of course, a lot depends on whether foreign investors 
entering the Polish market intend to make links to it permanent 
and to establish in Poland a modern basis for the development of 
production or whether such investors regard the Polish market 
purely in terms of an easy outlet for selling merchandise or 
services and a place with a relatively cheap labor force. I can 
assure you that there are increasing numbers of cases of serious 
investors who can see their future in our market for many years 
to come. 
  [Sieradzinski] You mentioned the Szczecin shipyard where, to 
my knowledge, at least, a managerial/employee contract for 
managing the company was extended at the end of March of this 
year, and not everyone was happy to see that. Why is that? 
  [Kaczmarek] I paid a visit there recently, but I can only 
guess what reservations voiced by various "advisers" may be all 
about. One must get it out in the open: It so happens, 
historically speaking, that every one of our shipyards has its 
own political sponsor or "patron." Any attempts at reform 
encounter particularly strong resistance in those places. 
  As for the Szczecin shipyard, a managerial contract was 
signed as early as 1992, and it was just extended because it 
proved extremely beneficial for the company. Let me remind you 
that, at the end of 1991, all the shipyard had was just one 
order to build a ship. Right now, its portfolio of orders 
amounts to approximately $460 million. 
  It is the only shipyard where the time period to build a 
unit 
was reduced to 12 months. With 6,000 employees, the shipyard's 
production level is double that of the two remaining shipyards, 
where 16,000 people are employed in total. As the only shipyard 
in the entire domestic shipyard industry, the Szczecin company 
pays its debts to its creditors, and its employees make much 
better money than in Gdansk or Gdynia. These are the facts and 
nobody can question them. 
  [Sieradzinski] Rumor has it that there are even plans in the 
shipyard to establish its own retirement pension fund. 
  [Kaczmarek] I have suggested to the employees that a kind of 
employee trust fund be established that could be devoted to 
paying out increased retirement pensions. I think that this kind 
of long-term capital investment may be beneficial for both 
employees of companies being privatized and the state budget. 
After all, the state could possibly support such initiatives 
through a system of tax breaks--that would be beneficial to 
public finances, out of which huge amounts are currently spent 
on subsidizing an inefficient and costly insurance system. 
  [Sieradzinski] Is the variety of establishing organs [organ 
zalozycielski] that represent the State Treasury's interests not 
an obstacle to you in coordinating the process of ownership 
transformations? 
  [Kaczmarek] The issue is not even about the fact that we 
have 
over 70 establishing organs. What is important is whether branch 
ministries are dealing with developing developmental strategies 
for a given branch, with defining rules of the game among 
economic units, or whether these branch ministries are trying to 
mainly execute their ownership functions, without a strategy 
that an owner should have. 
  Against this background, there have emerged quite a lot of 
doubts regarding distribution of powers between my ministry and 
several other ministries, such as agriculture, foreign economic 
cooperation, and industry. My view is that I should be 
responsible for the entire privatization process, while my 
colleagues in charge of specific sectors of the economy should 
exercise their ownership functions mainly through preparing 
developmental strategies for the branches that different 
enterprises could join, regardless of their ownership type. 
  [Sieradzinski] There is talk that it is precisely this 
dispute that caused a delay in the government's presentation of 
a privatization draft law within the framework of the Agreement 
on State-Owned Enterprises. 
  [Kaczmarek] I cannot deny that, even though that was not the 
only reason. The issue was also about enabling a prior debate by 
the government on a draft for transforming large and 
medium-sized enterprises into capital companies [spolki 
kapitalowe] controlled by the state (a new form of 
commercialization). We are past that stage right now. 
  There is no denying that another reason for the delay in 
preparing the law was that it is very hard to "tinker" with a 
document as important as this one without a deputy prime 
minister responsible for the economy. My assessment is that a 
governmental draft law on privatization, which would constitute 
the basis of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, will find 
its way into the Sejm at the end of May. 
  [Sieradzinski] What is the importance of a set of four 
programs that have been worked out by your ministry and debated 
recently by the government? 
  [Kaczmarek] We have proved to our critics that, after 
learning about the effects of privatization implemented by the 
previous governments up to now, we have our own idea for putting 
the process in order. Let me remind you that the issue is about: 
  --Transforming large and medium-sized enterprises into 
state-controlled capital companies, introducing a formula for 
employee management and comanagement that would be different 
from what it has been up to now. 
  --"Fast sale" of the greatest possible number of small and 
medium-sized enterprises (employing up to several hundred 
people) to employee companies [spolka pracownicza] and to other 
economic units. 
  --Improving the process of managing state-owned enterprises, 
which means abandoning bureaucratic management and replacing it 
with parameter-based management accomplished through capital 
structures. 
  --Setting in motion processes that will serve to improve the 
structure of public finances, especially in the area of social 
expenditures, such as health and retirement insurance. 
  [Sieradzinski] That is indeed quite a program, when you 
consider the accusations being levied against the coalition of 
having slowed down the rate of privatization, or of having 
stopped it altogether. 
  [Kaczmarek] Such views do not correspond to the truth. 
According to the report, during 1993, which was a good year for 
ownership transformations, a total of 364 privatization projects 
of various magnitudes were carried out. We have already 
implemented 86 such projects during the first quarter of this 
year, which is one-fourth of last year's amount. Apart from 
that, eight emission drafts have been presented (there was a 
total of three in all of 1993). We are preparing about 100 
enterprises to be transformed into share companies [spolki 
akcyjne] in connection with conciliation proceedings with 
banks--we did not have that last year at all. 
  The program for setting in motion that National Investment 
Funds is reaching its final stage. We will be able to announce, 
probably at the end of June, that, for instance, an "alpha" fund 
is being managed by "B" company, with a governing board made up 
of the following people....and also that the particular fund 
includes enterprises number 1 to 30, and so forth. This will 
allow us to begin distributing participation certificates 
[swiadectwa udzialowe] at the end of this year and the beginning 
of the next one. 
  Really, a lot is happening right now, and to speak about a 
slowdown in the rate of privatization is just another case of 
political "setting at odds." But, first of all, it is to the 
previous coalition that I "owe" the bad--outright 
disastrous--atmosphere surrounding privatization. I spend a 
majority of my time cleaning up after the past. So I am even 
more surprised with the easy-sounding nature of critical remarks 
addressed by former Minister Janusz Lewandowski regarding the 
current privatization process. You could really use some 
humility, Mr. Minister! 
  [Sieradzinski] So you can see no danger at all that 
privatization could bring about? 
  [Kaczmarek] Yes, I can see such dangers. I am, for instance, 
afraid that privatization of a group of enterprises might cause 
disruptions in the traditionally established connections with 
domestic producers from other branches. 
  The privatization by foreign investors in previous years of 
enterprises, producing detergents and other chemical products 
for households, led to a Kielce-based container plant suddenly 
losing its orders. The same thing may happen in the case of 
privatization of a large plant producing food concentrates. It 
will turn out that a large domestic glassworks no longer has 
orders for jar production, and, therefore, one will have to 
eliminate the plant. 
  Only coordination of privatization measures by just one 
ministry can shield us against the consequences of such 
decisions, with the ministry basing its decisions on an analysis 
of impact not just within a particular branch but taking the 
whole economy into account. 
  [Sieradzinski] When you were accepting the post of 
privatization minister, were you aware of the scale of 
responsibility you agreed to take upon yourself? 
  [Kaczmarek] The examples of my predecessors prevented me 
from 
forgetting that. I promised myself that I would not promote the 
kind of privatization that would bring to mind economic 
scandals, deteriorating work conditions, or investors neglecting 
the duties they took upon themselves. 
  I want privatization to become a process of enfranchisement 
of society, to contribute to limiting unemployment, and to 
provide a strong developmental incentive to the economy. Only 
then will we feel the positive impact of privatization. I will 
do everything in my power to keep this promise. 
  [Sieradzinski] Thank you for the conversation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Violeta Cvetkovska: "Do as I Say, Not as I </F>
Do"] 
  [Text] "A bowed head will not be cut by a spade," our 
people say, seeking to justify an existential obedience. 
  When the government first promoted its Stabilization Program 
for 1994 it said openly that the program had been prepared in 
consultation with and with the full agreement of the 
international financial experts (missions of the IMF and World 
Bank visited our country during the past year). That 
endorsement of the Stabilization Program by the world's 
financiers created the main image of the program. It was the 
reason that it quickly passed the test in parliament and among 
public opinion. At first, however, it was not necessary to pay 
special attention to or understand the fact that moral support 
for the program also meant financial assistance in implementing 
it, which was announced by the government with the calculations 
of some international donations and credits for the annual 
budget, either in paying back foreign debts or in other segments 
of the program: strengthening the balance of payments, 
structural reforms, privatization, social programs, and so on. 
  It would be more than crazy to turn down this support, which 
could at least move us out of the development standstill we are 
in, bearing in mind the financial situation we have been facing 
for a prolonged period, without personal prospects, with the 
fall in the social product, the collapse of manufacturing and 
production, and the lack of investment. However, you do not 
need to be specially clever to realize that those giving 
assistance and money, particularly if they come from the rich 
Western world, where the market, interest, and profit are the 
only criteria in finance, will want the way the money is used to 
be justified and will want respect for their market criteria -- 
from the very beginning, before getting verbal support, up to 
the final realization of the extended assistance. In practice 
this means constant control and "monitoring" of the total 
implementation of the program, with the constant danger of 
sanctions or the assistance being held back because of possible 
inconsistencies and disrespect for their market criteria and 
principles. 
<H5>  Positive Grades </H5>
  This much was clear to everybody, even the government 
members 
from the very beginning, although we can freely say we (they) 
were not totally aware of what this might look like in practice. 
It is now three months since implementation of the 
Stabilization program began and the diligent and hard-working 
financiers have sent another mission to evaluate the course of 
the stabilization, and, by the way, give us some much needed 
advice on the more rational and efficient implementation of the 
measures. 
  The general assessment of the implementation of the 
Stabilization program given by the head of the IMF mission, Paul 
Thompsen, and also the claims of some government officials (the 
Minister of Development Sofija Todorova, for instance) was "very 
good." Of course, in some sectors the forecast was even 
exceeded. They gave the grade "excellent" for inflation 
control, for instance, or the denar exchange rate, the hard 
currency reserves, and control of salaries. However, the 
international officials also "peeped" into public spending, the 
resources for the social program, structural reforms, the 
restructuring of companies, and therefore also into the process 
of privatization. There we got or can still get bad marks. This 
was to be seen in the next part of the practical exam. We were 
almost given a "bad minus" in the sphere of credit and monetary 
policy, in the sector directly related to the interest rate for 
the commercial banking system. It was the attempt to make a 
"parallel slalom" of interest policy with inflation in the 
context of overall macroeconomic policy, via an agreement on 
interest policy for 1994, which started as an initiative of the 
National Bank of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] and ended as a "gentleman's agreement" among 
the banks and savings houses that was described as state 
intervention directly endangering the market principles of bank 
management. When they heard of this idea for regulating 
interest policy (linking it to the discount rate of the National 
Bank of Macedonia, which does not imply a "freeze"), the IMF 
representatives were very opposed, although they listened to the 
arguments of our financial experts, that is, the Macedonian 
National Bank. The world's financiers were not persuaded by the 
argument that the banks were not very flexible in adjusting 
enormously high interest rates to current falling inflation, 
thus creating enormous bank taxes such as exist nowhere in the 
world (over 450 percent at an annualized rate), are a great 
burden on the exhausted economy, and act as a boomerang on the 
banking balance (which remains in a constant "minus" because of 
the impossibility of paying the same interest rates). At a 
certain point in the argument the IMF strictly opposed any 
intervention by the Macedonian National Bank in interest rate 
policy, saying that that was not market management -- and you 
have committed yourself to the market economy -- and it 
imperiled further credit support. State intervention could 
imperil the second tranche of $17.5 million of IMF credit, the 
"stand by" arrangement with the IMF worth at least $35 million 
and the $60 million from the World Bank for structural reforms 
($40 million of which is to be used this year). Nobody could 
put these sums at stake. Therefore the Macedonian National Bank 
(the state, you could say) withdrew from interest rate 
policymaking, from its initiative, control and sanctioning, not 
to mention introducing a kind of discipline in the high bank 
interests. The logic of the IMF's good intentions was that the 
interest rates should be formed freely on the market. If they 
are high, so much the better, because they will serve as a good 
warning to those who do not pay promptly. Companies will give 
up the idea of obtaining expensive credits from the banks. As 
far as the present unsuitable situation is concerned in which 
many companies are not repaying their debts, the IMF has a more 
restrictive, but more effective recipe (in their opinion). 
  The banks must be prevented from immediately rewriting 
interest rates for companies that owe large sums of money, that 
is, from investing in such enterprises, thus disrupting the 
spiral of blockades, liquidations, and so on. In that way the 
bad companies and banks will be strictly weeded out (and 
liquidated) and a clear picture of the value of each one on the 
new market economy in the state will emerge. This is quite 
logical, but it is inapplicable in our circumstances. It means 
most of our companies will be shut down, liquidated, and the 
banks will not end up any better than if they try to give the 
money a little heart and soul for the national economy. 
<H5>  Double Standards </H5>
  The other advice of the international financiers on 
restructuring and preparation for privatization was also quite 
categorical: close down all your big systems and plants that are 
not currently making a profit (or have not been making profit 
for some time), liquidate the plants, and strip the companies of 
redundant workers. This means a massive social burden that has 
yet to be taken care of. There will be support for that, too -- 
but later on. In any case, you will have to start the 
restructuring yourselves. We can only give you advice, point 
out your "failures," and say where you cannot expect profit, and 
how many redundant workers you have. The moment the healthy 
segments step on good and profitable ground, we shall even 
finance you. Until then, no fresh capital. With that aim, 25 
of the biggest losers were identified, and they are not allowed 
to touch the expensive banking credits, unless the state becomes 
their guarantor. If it wants to save them, let it do so, as far 
as its guarantee and financial possibilities permit. It is 
unnecessary to state how far they do permit. 
  These two elements that have now come to the surface caused 
a 
lot of commotion regarding the principles and good will of these 
messages. Nobody denies the principles and the global approach 
(and financing) of these institutions, but one might have 
reservations regarding the choice of variant. Even our less 
experienced negotiators (after confidential discussions with 
members of the missions) were aware that the international 
officials entered all the negotiations with a dozen variants 
graded by severity and adaptability. First the strictest 
variant (for us) is presented, which is the most principled one 
for them. Then they withdraw, depending on the skill of the 
negotiators of the other side (ours). However, there is a limit 
beyond which it is impossible to go. Evidently, we, with our 
experience, are not very rich in variants to offer, nevertheless 
some experience gives us the right to have courage in the 
negotiations. 
  To be more precise, some of our globetrotters and experts 
following the world's financial trends are confused by the 
double standard in the behavior of particularly those who are 
bigger and richer in their market economies. Namely, as far as 
interest rates are concerned, even these international financing 
institutions, when giving credits, do not themselves act the way 
they profess in giving verbally declarations of support. In 
giving credits to Germany and Macedonia, they do not apply the 
same interest rates, that is, the interest for us is higher 
because we are a country of greater risk, regardless of the fact 
that we are poorer and need another type of support. As far as 
the free formation of bank interest rates is concerned, Milan 
Hrovat, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, recently 
cited the example of the European Union holding summits on 
Germany's high interest rates (they said they were attracting 
all the capital from the other countries) and they forced it to 
lower the rates to a tolerable EU level. That was not state, 
but interstate intervention.

  [Text] President Tudjman has replied to a letter from Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. The 
following is the text of the president's reply: 
  I have received your letter confirming an interest in the 
speedy and comprehensive implementation of the Washington 
agreement. I maintain that it can already be said that since 
the agreement was signed Bosniak-Croatian relations have been 
developing in a positive way and that on the whole we can be 
satisfied with initial results. 
  I agree with you, however, that everything should be done to 
implement as soon as possible the agreement in its entirety and 
that those impeding this positive process on either side should 
be neutralized. I firmly believe that it is possible and 
necessary to resolve all the issues you mentioned to our mutual 
satisfaction. I again stress that you can fully rely on all my 
influence in order to fully implement as soon as possible the 
agreements signed in Washington. 
  I believe that my visit to Sarajevo will take place soon and 
I am ready to travel as soon as this is technically possible. I 
believe that this visit will facilitate quicker solutions of all 
open issues and the further development of mutual understanding 
and cooperation between the Croatian and the Bosniak-Muslim 
people and between the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
Republic of Croatia.

Serbian people in the RSK [republic of Serbian Krajina]. We 
expect the international community to respect all national 
interests on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and to

with other Serbian states. We have established that the peace 
agreement signed in Zagreb is being implemented successfully, 
Dr. Milan Babic, RSK minister of foreign affairs, said on the 
occasion of the resumption of the peace talks with Croatia and 
added the following: 
  "My proposal to the government was -- and it has been 
accepted -- to hold negotiations on the border crossing between 
the RSK and the Republic of Croatia in Turanj. The Croatian side 
also does not want to negotiate in some world capital, because 
that would involve a great cost and require the engagement of a 
large number of accompanying services. We may have resumed the 
talks today, but we adjourned them until after the Easter 
holidays. We shall offer the Croatian side, as well as the 
international factors, a list of priority economic and 
humanitarian issues that will make a more suitable basis for 
successfully realizing the third round of talks on solving the

<F P=106> [Article by Sanja Modric: "The Manolic-Mesic Parliamentary </F>
Storm"] 
  [Text] The steering committee of the new party, the 
Croatian Independent Democrats [HND], the founding of which was 
announced by Josip Manolic about a month ago, after he had been 
relieved of all his duties in the HDZ [Croatian Democratic 
Community], will today be presented to the public at the news 
conference that will be held at the European Center in Zagreb. 
The fax sent to the editorial offices of the Croatian papers 
yesterday around noon, containing information about the event, 
finally eliminated the doubts about whether Manolic would 
persist in founding the party of HDZ malcontents, and dispelled 
speculations according to which Stipe Mesic, the number one 
Parliament man, had withdrawn and gone back to the party in 
power. Namely, today's news conference will be held by Josip 
Manolic and Stipe Mesic, presidents of the two chambers of the 
Croatian parliament. 
  It is therefore evident that Mesic has not "calmed down" 
after the mild, but indicative, reprimand issued to him at the 
Club of HDZ Representatives on 7 April by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, 
president of the party and president of the state, himself. The 
high officials of the party in power who, after this event, 
claimed publicly and privately that Mesic would undoubtedly stay 
in the party, interpreting Mesic's fiercely critical interviews 
as harmless scenes caused by "Stipica's ruffled temper," were 
not right either. (Another) precedent has thus emerged in 
Croatia: Two key parliament men, both founders of the party in 
power, are leaving their political nest and becoming part of the 
opposition. Whether President Tudjman's threat that "this 
state," headed by him, will not remain "politically and legally 
helpless" against the dissident Manolic will be actualized, and 
who else it could include, is yet to be seen. However, it is 
already clear that Manolic is neither alone, nor has he agreed 
to the role of the defeated, which he has too readily been 
offered by the HDZ center. 
  Trying to find out which people would appear before the 
reporters at the European Center on behalf of the HND, we phoned 
the party center in Nova Ves 23a, which is temporarily in the 
offices of Azur. It is interesting that the owner of the company 
is Josip Zebic, an HDZ member known to the public for having 
been the first president of the committee for renaming the 
Zagreb streets and squares. 
<H5>  The HND Founding Assembly by 1 May? </H5>
  We talked to Darko Hrastovec, who introduced himself as one 
of the founders of the new party. He said that the "independent 
democrats" consist of a "wide circle of people," but he would 
name only Perica Juric, a HDZ representative, and father 
Tomislav Pavao Duka, who has recently left the party in power 
and become an independent representative. Hrastovec also told 
us that they would present the HND aims and program today. He 
announced that the founding assembly of the HND was "probably 
going to be held by 1 May." The party will then file a 
registration request to the Ministry of Public Administration of 
the Republic of Croatia. Unless someone comes first, the 
"independent democrats" will have the registration number 65. 
Namely, there are at present 64 political parties on the 
ministry's list, and it is difficult to remember even the names 
of some of them. 
  The registration of Manolic and Mesic's party will be 
conducted in compliance with the new Law on Political Parties, 
which came into effect in late August last year, and which made 
the conditions for founding a party twice as strict as before. 
According to the former law, 50 people were necessary to found 
a party, and now it takes 100. They have to be "persons of age 
and fit for work," citizens of the Republic of Croatia. 
Attorney Slobodan Budak explained to us that, in compliance 
with the constitutional right to free political association, it 
is not necessary to file a registration request to the Ministry 
of Public Administration, but rather an application. The state 
body cannot refuse registration of a party if the associated 
holders of the same political views meet several basic formal 
conditions. The application must be filed with the ministry up 
to 15 days after the founding assembly of the new party takes 
place, the name of the party must be different from the 
registered names, and the documentation must contain the minutes 
from the founding assembly, a statute, a program, and the list 
of the founders' names, with the evidence that they are Croatian 
citizens. The ministry has the obligation to deliver the ruling 
up to 30 days after the application has been sent, and the party 
has the obligation to publish their program in one ofthe daily 
papers or in NARODNE NOVINE. Any party whose program "instigates 
or calls to violent endangering of the democratic constitutional 
system, independence, integrality, or territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Croatia" will be denied registration. 

<H5>    The Overture to Preterm Elections? </H5>
  One of the questions provoked by the news of the founding of 
the new party is whether this act will deepen and prolong the 
parliamentary crisis in Croatia, and if Manolic and Mesic's 
departure from the HDZ will actually leads to early elections. 
The answer will emerge when all the names that the "M and M" are 
counting on are "presented" to the public. Namely, if six 
"turncoats" from the Chamber of Counties, members of the party 
in power, and 16 of them from the Chamber of Representatives 
join the HND, the HDZ loses the majority in the parliament. 
Naturally, it would take absolute cooperation of the entire 
opposition, which, as we have learned, is not too united, to 
achieve such parliamentary balance. Namely, there have been 
announcements that, in case the least favorable version of the 
development of events occurs, the HDZ could procure a coalition 
with the Croatian Peasants Party [HSS] and thus keep the 
parliament majority. Some opposition leaders believe that Drago 
Stipac [HSS president] would agree to this, although there are 
many HSS members who would oppose this fusion. The 
representatives of the Serbian National Party, who, according to 
some interpretations, will be "cooperative" with the party in 
power because they have received a great amount of money to 
finance the activities of the Serbian association Prosvjeta, 
have recently stated that "the coalition with the HDZ is out of 
the question." Other opposition parties have also decidedly 
declined any possibility of forming a coalition with the HDZ. 
  After certain papers have already stated who some of 
Manolic's sympathizers from the Club of HDZ Representatives are, 
and after some of them immediately distanced themselves publicly 
from "flirting" with the new party, it would be unrewarding to 
present the names to the public. However, very soon they will 
be known. Some claim that the secret followers of Manolic and 
Mesic will find it easier to decide to make public appearances 
in their new roles as soon as the new party is registered and 
thus becomes a valid political subject in parliament. Many thus 
believe that there are many surprises in store regarding the 
transfer from the HDZ to the HND. Many have connected the 
forecasts concerning the success or failure of the new party 
with the support the founders have managed to "win" in the 
influential international circles, which is still completely 
unknown here. In the lobbies there has been talk that Manolic 
has sent his recently published reply to Tudjman to many foreign 
addresses, allegedly adding a special "annex" with explanations. 
For the time being it is impossible to check whether these are 
only rumors, and there is no information about what the response 
to this mail has been. 
  At any rate, the "tempest in the teapot," which is how 
President Tudjman called the effects of Manolic's disobedience, 
has undoubtedly turned out to be a real, big storm. Will it be 
overcome by democratic or "political and legal" means?

<F P=106> [Article by Marko Barisic: "Wrong Interpretations of </F>
Tudjman"] 
  [Text] Few could have anticipated that the dilemma from 
the last HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] congress about 
whether this political body would grow from a movement into a 
party was going to leave so many scars on the Croatian political 
scene, and so much uncertainty that now even the normal 
functioning of the parliament is questioned. This will be used 
in raising the question of the democratic system of Croatia, and 
even its stability. 
  Let us remind readers that for a while Tudjman supported the 
faction that wanted to turn the HDZ from a movement into a 
Christian democrat-oriented party, but he later joined those 
headed by Manolic, who asked that the HDZ retain the original 
principles, that is, that of a movement, with the emphasis on 
national party. 
  The HDZ movement has lately been executing Manolic in a way 
that all the movements have employed through history: by taking 
the conflict to the end. All the media are involved. Manolic's 
photographs no longer appear in certain papers, columnists who 
used to favor the movement, most often believing in it, are 
doing their best to blacken the name of the man who until 
recently was the closest associate of the movement leader. 
Manolic is no longer a person with different political 
positions; he has become a traitor, a Rankovic, a chetnik. No 
wonder -- a movement, whether it is called the HDZ or otherwise, 
functions as a community of holders of the same views, and as 
soon as an individual from within the community persists in his 
positions, the movement rejects them because they betrayed the 
community. 
<H5>  The Movement and the Party </H5>
  By insisting at the last congress that the HDZ be a 
movement, 
and now deciding to persist in his position, Manolic himself 
created the conditions for this kind of breakup. If he had 
joined those now condemning him, and who then supported the 
transformation of the movement into a party, Manolic would now 
be leader of a HDZ faction, completely legal. Apart from his 
left faction, at least two more (right and center) would have 
emerged, which is the case in all the parties in all the 
European countries in which national movements for the 
liberation from the occupying forces or for the forming of the 
state had finished the job long ago, while time and observance 
of the democratic procedure have made them countries with a 
stable democratic system. 
  The factors of this stability are political parties with 
legalized factions, and this way of dealing with those who do 
not share the same views is therefore impossible in their 
systems, as they are not considered traitors. If they change 
their views, they transfer from one faction to another, or from 
one party to another, and in the process no one gets excited. 
On the contrary, the party tries to persuade such individuals 
to stay, and if they do leave, the party expresses regrets about 
it. 
  In the case of a movement, things are different: It sends 
such individuals away (the official statement said Manolic had 
been "expelled" from the HDZ), and tries to oust them 
politically (Manolic is meeting with Paraga), personally 
(Manolic is a member of Yugoslav State Security Service, as if 
he had not been one until two months ago), and morally (he is 
blackmailing Duka). 
  Manolic has thus become a victim of his own political 
beliefs. Moreover, he is responsible for having used his 
influence -- indisputable at the time -- and preventing the 
movement from becoming a party, which is a guarantee for the 
establishment of democratic bases, which should, through the 
body of the party, gradually penetrate the entire body of 
society. Signs of lack of democratic procedure are not 
characteristic of only one party. Other parties have also been 
affected by the inauguration of nondemocratic procedures. Not 
only have they been affected, but, because of applying methods 
of the same kind, they are gradually being destroyed by it. 
They have been functioning less as parties and more as 
movements -- minor ones. 
<H5>  Squaring Accounts in the Opposition Parties </H5>
  The way it has been done in the IDS [Istrian Democratic 
Congress] by the movement leader Jakovcic and the so-called 
Herak group is well known. Jakovcic has proclaimed them the 
"moles" of the HDZ, that is, betrayers of the movement, and, at 
a convenient time, when they were not present, expelled them 
from the movement. In fact, they did not have the same views; 
they were a faction, and now they are saying that they are 
devoted to the IDS, and that they will found a new one. The 
cause of the dissension is the same as in the HDZ: lack of 
democratic procedure within the party. A similar event took 
place in the HSS [Croatian Peasants Party] when a group of 
members with different views, gathered around Madjor, tried to 
overthrow Drago Stipac as president. They did not manage to do 
it, so he threw them out. Even if the reverse had happened, the 
nature of the conflict would not have been different. 
  A similar situation has recently occurred in the HSLS 
[Croatian Social Liberal Party], the strongest opposition party. 
At the party conference in Kutina two factions were in conflict 
because of the recently forced syndrome of "Herzegovinian 
politics." One of the factions, headed by Vilfan and supported 
by Fizulic, asked that the party expel all the so-called 
Herzegovinian cadres from the politics of both Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They gloated over the failure of the 
"Herceg-Bosna project," saying the worst possible things about 
the people there, forgetting that a young man from, for 
instance, Ljubuski, who was mobilized in a normal procedure and 
killed at, say, Gornji Vakuf, had nothing to do with high 
politics, where decisions about the forms of political 
organization were made. 
  In the war with the Muslims he was just as much a patriot 
as when, at the beginning of the Serbian aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he had stood before the Serbian tanks 
unarmed. Zoric, vice president of the party, opposed Vilfan and 
Fizulic's positions at the Kutina conference. A conflict 
occurred which, interpreted in political terms, means that two 
very different factions have been established: Vilfan's liberal 
and Zoric's social-liberal one. Budisa took Zoric's side, but 
in such a way as not to lose Vilfan. 
<H5>  Connecting Vessels </H5>
  The HDZ democratic centralism, or, more clearly said: Lack 
of 
democratic procedures, has, through the principle of connecting 
vessels, spread to most of the major Croatian parties (the rest 
are at a standstill or about to break up). However, it did not 
stop there. It also spread to most of the media, and even to 
the Croatian state institutions. The stories about the election 
of the Zagreb University president, about the status of the 
Central Croatian Cultural and Publishing Society, or those about 
electing school principals, hospital principals, managers of 
public companies, which could be anything but models of 
democratic activities, are well known. One of the main culprits 
for this is Josip Manolic, because, not knowing political 
theory, he insisted that the movement remain. He will hardly be 
able to correct his delusions by legalizing his faction and 
founding a new party. However, the HDZ may be taking another 
direction as a movement, a new way toward becoming a party. 
  The cause for this consideration is the statement of the HDZ 
head secretary and head of the President's office, Dr. Jure 
Radic (a person who, because of his position, should not only 
express his private views, but, more likely, those of the 
institution he is head of), in the last issue of DANAS, 
regarding the explosion at Duboki Jarak [reference to the 
explosion of a military warehouse near Sesvete]. "There are some 
who would like Gojko Susak not to be defense minister," said 
Radic and added: "What if it is established that those who want 
Susak to leave are responsible for the tragedy at Sesvete?" As 
part of the opposition wanted that, most of all the Manolic 
group, it is clear that Radic's statement, which was later 
published in all the papers, paved the way for a new political 
procedure. Although none of the committees investigating the 
reasons for the explosion has published the results of the 
investigation, Radic's pointing the finger at a possible culprit 
can also be an indication of new political relations in Croatia. 
Having been expelled from the HDZ, Manolic is no longer a 
betrayer of the movement; he is a possible terrorist, a person 
who plants bombs, mines. He wants to overthrow the legal 
authorities through terrorist activities. Clearly, he is not 
the only one; those gathered around him in stage one, and in 
stage two all those "on the other side," both from the HDZ and 
the opposition, can become "the Manolic people," therefore 
terrorists. Ultimately, anyone who is suspicious can be a 
terrorist. In all the political science textbooks this form of 
dealing with those who do not hold the same views is called 
civil war. First within the HDZ, and later, consequently, in 
the entire Croatian nation. 
<H5>  Youth and Lack of Experience </H5>
  Ivic Pasalic, the President's adviser for internal politics, 
has, perhaps unintentionally, contributed to the HDZ growing 
into a hard movement rather than into a party with his 
announcement that the HDZ was soon "starting the process of 
decommunization." Considering the fact that the HDZ holds most 
of the authority in the state, it could so happen that this 
"decommunization" is not only implemented within the party, but, 
by the nature of things, in the entire state machinery. In view 
of the fact that a number of Croatian people were involved in 
the communist machinery, it is not difficult to imagine what 
that could mean. First of all, there could appear the danger of 
a certain number of Croats being pushed to the margin by 
politically nondemocratic means, by the creation of new 
divisions, and by the demand to prove suitability. This time 
the "right ones" could be those who did not write praises to 
socialism and were not part of the communist authorities. 
<H5>  Legalizing the Factions </H5>
  Pasalic and Radic may have been led to these "radical" 
statements by their youth and lack of experience. Considering 
Tudjman's opus and his active idea of national conciliation, 
which is what led to the forming and defense of the Croatian 
state, it is important to point out the possible traps in these 
"interpretations." Instead of creating the preconditions for 
establishing a democratic political atmosphere, these 
"interpretations" lead to the brink of a conflict within the 
Croatian national corps. As if once was not enough, and as if 
the consequences of this division should not be enough of a 
warning about what danger the present Croatia is facing. 
However, we should hope that, despite the harsh words that are 
piling up on both sides, neither of the two sides, or the 
others, will cross the threshold where the limits of the legal 
state end and violence begins, because they do not want to enter 
a conflict that would turn into a civil war. 
  According to one of the political analysts, there is a deep 
misunderstanding between Manolic and Tudjman. He proposes that 
two things be done to calm the situation, which even threatens 
to turn into a parliamentary crisis. He proposes that Manolic 
give up the idea of a movement and accept the HDZ as a 
Christian-democratic oriented party (in most of the European 
countries the former Communists go over to the Christian 
democrats), and that Tudjman accept the general rules concerning 
the possibility of factions existing within the HDZ as a party. 
  The legalization of the factions means that the movement 
automatically becomes a party and that different forms of 
political behavior are in force. This would have a positive 
influence on the stability of the other Croatian parties to the 
degree that it has so far been negative. 
  In any democratic system, the majority must protect the 
minority, provided the minority give up violence. This is a 
lesson that Manolic should have learned by now. Dictatorship or 
civil war are always a worse form of war, and they have more 
serious consequences than defense wars waged against an 
aggressor. Let us remember what Hitler told Pavelic a few weeks 
after the Independent State of Croatia was established: "Croatia 
emerged by accident. If the English had not staged the coup in 
Belgrade, we would still have supported Yugoslavia." Let us not 
forget Baker; the Americans also supported Yugoslavia at the 
beginning of the Serbian aggression. The fear of the renewal of 
Yugoslavia is still present. It would not be good if it is 
again built on Croat corpses. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>
<H5>  Interview With Drazen Budisa, HSLS President: "I Do Not Know </H5>
What Manolic's Plans Are" 
  [Barisic] What is your position regarding the "Manolic 
case"? 
  [Budisa] The president of the Chamber of Counties has the 
right to hold a session of the Chamber of Counties whenever he 
decides it is necessary. The rules of procedure grant too much 
authority to the presidents of both the Chamber of Counties and 
the Chamber of Representatives; situations such as this were not 
taken into account. However, we consider that even laws we do 
not consider good should be obeyed, and our relation toward the 
rules of procedure is the same. At this moment I do not know 
how and when the session of the Chamber of Counties will be 
held. It is also logical that the positions of presidents of 
both chambers belong to the party in power, although I would 
like to point out that the HDZ representatives voted against my 
nomination for deputy parliament chairman at the Chamber of 
Representatives, and elected Mr. Djukic [president of the 
Serbian National Party] instead. I have not contacted Mr. 
Manolic since the talks of the presidents of the opposition 
parties, so I do not know what his plans are. 
  I suppose that Manolic is trying to gain time so he can 
carry 
out preparations for the organization of the new party, which 
means putting together the program and the statute, and getting 
as many citizens and HDZ representatives as possible to start 
the new party. I will not conceal the fact that we in the HSLS 
consider this stratification useful for the democratic 
development of Croatia, since the role of the HDZ in Croat 
political life has been predominant, while at the last elections 
it (the HDZ) did not have the support of the electoral body that 
would justify this predominance. 
  The HSLS did not start this parliamentary crisis -- to be 
honest, it could not have done so -- which, if it does emerge, 
will be a consequence of the conflict in the party in power. 
Since we consider Mr. Manolic to have done a good job as 
president of the Chamber of Counties, our representatives will 
vote against his replacement. If he is replaced, then the issue 
of the new president of the Chamber of Counties will certainly 
arise, and I suppose talks will be held. We believe that the 
party that has the most representatives is entitled to have its 
member as president of the Chamber of Counties. However, since 
this did not happen in a similar situation regarding the 
election of the deputy president at the Chamber of 
Representatives, we have the possibility, regarding the 
candidate, to take the position we decide is best during the 
election. 
  [Barisic] How do you see the possibility of early elections? 
  [Budisa] I think it is logical that any self-respecting 
opposition party wants elections to be held as soon as possible. 
Not only would we not oppose them -- we want them, but it is not 
up to the HSLS if they will be held or not. 
  [Barisic] To what extent do you think the Manolic case has 
international implications? Namely, it can often be heard that 
he is an agent of certain Western circles. 
  [Budisa] Every topical political event in Croatia has an 
international dimension. I think that the president's recent 
statement at the closed-door session of the Club of the HDZ 
Representatives has contributed to this. He pointed out two 
things: one was that one of the world powers had offered Croatia 
help in founding its defense system, on the condition that 
Manolic withdraw. The other was that the present official 
Croatian politics and authorities were coordinated with the 
Western interests, and that each attempt at destabilizing the 
authorities, including Manolic's attempt, had a background on 
the other side of the political spectrum, that is, in the East. 
I can answer your question if Manolic was carrying out the 
wishes of the West only by saying that this is completely 
contrary to what the president of the Republic said. 
  These topics are so big that I think this discussion could 
not end without a conversation either during the discussion of 
Manolic's replacement, or through a parliamentary committee that 
would examine the basis of such positions. If the people from 
the top are called to account for promoting foreign interests, 
we ask that the parliamentary committee also evaluate the former 
activities of those who allegedly promoted somebody else's 
interests. It is certain that there are many foreign secret 
services in Croatia at present, but I think that there is no 
relevant political force or party in Croatia at present that is 
conducted from abroad. I would interpret these accusations 
primarily as a heritage from the communist past, when each 
political opponent was accused either of being a real or a 
potential foreign agent. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
<H5>  Interview With Josip Manolic, President of the Chamber of </H5>
Counties: "I Will Leave Upon Secret Vote" 
  [Barisic] Mr. Manolic, you have refused to hold a session in 
spite of the demands of the HDZ representatives. You said that 
either a solution will be found in an agreement, or else there 
would be a parliamentary crisis. 
  [Manolic] When a parliamentary crisis emerges in any of the 
multiparty systems, the resolution of the crisis is sought in 
the agreement of all the parliamentary factions -- if there is a 
wish to overcome the crisis. 
  [Barisic] What do you mean by "agreement"? 
  [Manolic] That is again a matter of agreement. I think that 
the crisis can be overcome in two ways: by electing a new 
president of the Chamber of Counties, or by keeping the old one. 
  [Barisic] Do you think that is also a possibility? 
  [Manolic] I think it is, as a certain regrouping of forces 
in that respect has already been carried out within the party in 
power. 
  [Barisic] However, some of the representatives of whom it 
was said they would join you have publicly denied it. 
  [Manolic] I have not said anyone would support me and vote 
for me. There was therefore nothing to deny. There are 
indications that there will not only be 1 percent of HDZ 
representatives who will join us, as the president was 
generously offering. The balance of powers regarding this issue 
is quite different. 
  [Barisic] Do you know what position the opposition will 
take? 
  [Manolic] The opposition parties have all supported me. 
They have thus expressed solidarity with the method of 
resolving the dispute concerning the position of president of 
the Chamber of Counties, not entering the dispute between me and 
the HDZ leadership. 
  [Barisic] What is important about this method? 
  [Manolic] The important thing is that in the process of 
replacing the former president or electing a new one the rules 
of procedure are observed, that the procedure is carried out 
through secret vote. The rules of procedure say that secret 
vote can be carried out in the elections if there is more than 
one candidate. I will accept that immediately if there is a 
multiparty agreement on it at the Chamber of Counties. Those 
who oppose the secret vote are not only opposing the rules of 
procedure, but the democratic procedure in general. 
  [Barisic] When are you going to hold the session? 
  [Manolic] I will do so when all the political elements 
necessary for the session to continue are present. 
  [Barisic] When do you think that could be? 
  [Manolic] As I have said, only when an agreement is 
previously made concerning the way to overcome this crisis. 
  [Barisic] Is that an invitation for talks to the "other" 
side? 
  [Manolic] It is a good chance for resolving the entire case 
by talking at the same level, observing the rules of procedure, 
rather than, as is the case here, by using nondemocratic methods.

Bloc"] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- As stated by the Croatian National 
Democratic League, right-wing Croatian parties held a meeting in 
Zagreb on Thursday [28 April]. These were the Croatian 
State-Creating Movement (HDP), the Croatian Democratic Party 
(HDS), the Croatian Democratic Party of Rights (HDSP), the 
Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP), the Croatian Republican 
Community (HRZ), the Croatian Party (HS), the Croatian Party of 
Rights (HSP), the Party of Croatian State Rights (SHDP), and the 
Croatian National Democratic League (HNDL). 
  The parties agreed in principle on the creation of a bloc of 
Croatian national, rights-oriented, state-creating, and 
right-wing parties so that they could jointly appear and act in 
public in the future, proceeding from Croatia's state and 
national interests. According to the statement, they discussed 
the political situation in detail.

<F P=106> [Report by Franjo Kiseljak: "Kuna on Statehood Day"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- After being used for three years and five 
months and honorably accomplishing the task of achieving the 
monetary independence of Croatia, the temporary Croatian dinar 
will go into the albums of numismatists and the memory of its 
users as the currency with which they experienced difficult 
times and the end of hyperinflationary humiliation. The dinar 
vouchers issued by the Ministry of Finance, as announced 
earlier, will be withdrawn from circulation on Statehood Day. 
They will be replaced with the real money of the National Bank 
of Croatia, which was originally supposed to be called kruna but 
has been renamed kuna. 
  It is interesting that the replacement of the money will be 
complete. In addition to paper money, the kuna, citizens will 
also find in their pockets coins called lipa. Parents will again 
be able to buy for their children "piggy" saving boxes and 
similar devices for collecting coins that could eventually be 
transferred in the savings books. 
  The entire operation of replacing money and all the 
technical 
details will be elaborated on in a special bill. The National 
Bank of Croatia has already prepared the working version of the 
bill, which will require endorsement by the government and the 
assembly. Correspondents have not seen the working version yet, 
but, judging by what was said at the government's session last 
Thursday [28 April], the most serious option concerning the 
exchange of money is the one proposing that three decimal points 
be knocked off. For instance, newspapers costing 2,500 Croatian 
dinars would cost 2.5 kunas. 
  Such a denomination would be extremely simple and practical, 
even for those who require more time to work with naughts. 
However, some people are proposing that even four naughts be 
knocked off. In this case, coins would gain in value, something 
that could turn out to be useful for several reasons. The state 
would earn more. The state is entitled to the difference 
between the nominal value and the cost of producing the coins. 
The coins with greater purchasing power, which is still more 
important, would make people more aware of the fact that every 
coin, even the lowest denomination, are worth something and 
should therefore be respected. 
  Possible objections to the "impossible psychological parity" 
of one German mark only being worth 37 lipas, or 3.7 kunas in 
the case of knocking off three decimal points, could be 
countered in the following way: It could be assumed that, as a 
result of structural disturbances, inflation will do its part 
and real wages will in the meantime rise to 1,000 German marks. 
Once we start receiving decent wages, it would not be a bad 
idea to stick with simple, four-digit figures. It would be good 
to hear what experts and those who will replace money in about 
one month have to say about this.

  [Excerpts] Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys arrived 
for a one-day official visit in the Slovak Republic today. This 
morning he met with his departmental counterpart, Pavel Kanis. 
Our correspondent Miroslav Minar reports: 
  [Minar] The Czech defense minister's visit is taking place 
in 
connection with the first unofficial working meeting between 
Minister Baudys and former Slovak Defense Minister [Imrich] 
Andrejcak at Vranov nad Dyji. 
  The special military plane from Prague landed at Milan 
Rastislav Stefanik airport at 0930, and, shortly after that, the 
Czech guest was welcomed on Slovak territory by Defense Minister 
Pavel Kanis. 
  The talks, which took place after the welcoming ceremony, 
were attended by experts from both sides and contained, above 
all, a proposal of the agreement between the defense ministries 
of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic on mutual 
cooperation. The two sides will exchange information to the 
extent of the powers entrusted to them and stipulated by Slovak 
and Czech legal regulations and will cooperate on the basis of 
reciprocity and mutual advantage. 
  The first glance at the text of the agreement shows that the 
extent of cooperation is broad and that the individual spheres 
concern all parts of the military. For example, in the coming 
period, the parties to the agreement should cooperate in 
building their armies and mobilization systems in conditions of 
peace, technical development, military training and science, 
personnel work, social and health security, culture, and sport. 
[passage omitted] 
  During the joint events, the official languages of the two 
states that are parties to the agreement will be used. 
  Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Slovak Defense 
Minister Pavel Kanis signed the text of the agreement on mutual 
cooperation shortly before 1200. A news conference is under way 
at this time.

  [Text] "Have you officially announced your departure from 
the Club of Deputies and the Movement?" PRACA No. 97 asked M. 
Hudina, deputy of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. 
  [Hudina] I notified the parliament chairman in writing last 
week. 
  [PRACA] What made you leave the HZDS? 
  [Hudina] There were reports about the HZDS conducting 
negotiations on the formation of a national democratic bloc. 
Because I was the sole deputy of Hungarian nationality in the 
HZDS Club of Deputies, I realized that I could not remain in 
such a bloc. My decision was also influenced by the passage of 
the law on names and surnames, by the so-called law on bilingual 
signs, and, last but not least, by the speeches by I. Chamula of 
the Slovak National Party, who constantly attacks the Hungarian 
ethnic minority. I was not enthusiastic about the formation of 
a coalition with this party and was the only [HZDS] deputy who 
did not sign it. 
  [PRACA] You have become an independent deputy. Toward which 
party do you lean? 
  [Hudina] I was present at the constituent assembly of the 
Democratic Union of Slovakia and will most probably become its 
member.

    [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 28 and 29 April 
publish reports on comments made by representatives of Slovak 
right-wing and center parties on the meeting of these parties' 
leaders in Bratislava on 26 April, which dealt with their 
cooperation in the election campaign. 
  Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 28 April on page 
3 
carries a 200-word TA SR report on a news conference given by 
National Democratic Party-New Alternative Chairman Ludovit 
Cernak in Bratislava on 27 April. Cernak is quoted as saying 
that the five parties attending the 26 April meeting "showed 
interest in cooperating. They will agree on the form of this 
cooperation by the end of May at the latest." Cernak reportedly 
also said that all five parties "practically rejected the 
possibility of postelection cooperation with the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia." 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 29 April on page 3 carries a 
200-word "dos"-signed report on a news conference given by the 
leadership of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) in 
Bratislava on 28 April. Speaking about the 26 April meeting of 
the leaders of "five right-wing and centrist parties," KDH 
Chairman Jan Carnogursky reportedly described it "as unlikely 
that all of these parties would contest the elections with a 
single slate of candidates. He supposes, however, that the 
number of slates of candidates will be under five."

Cernak signed as chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS],

presidential candidate, have disappeared concurrently with 
Cernak's departure from the SNS. The publication of these

adviser to the SNS chairman, said at an SNS briefing in 
Bratislava yesterday. He added that, within the framework of 
his election campaign, one day before his election, Michal Kovac 
had signed certain agreements, in which he pledged to the SNS to 
execute the office of the president in a certain way if he 
gained its support. According to Peter Sokol, in recalling 
former Minister of Foreign Affairs Milan Knazko, the president 
acted completely at variance with this pledge. "I have the 
justified suspicion that Mr. Cernak's possession of these 
documents may have a certain influence on the president's 
conduct," Peter Sokol said.

  [Text] Bratislava--"I resolutely deny and protest the 
allegation that I have misappropriated some important documents 
that I had signed as chairman of the Slovak National Party 
[SNS]," Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the National Democratic 
Party-New Alternative, said yesterday. He was reacting to the 
words of Peter Sokol at yesterday's SNS briefing (a report on 
which we comment elsewhere--editor's note) that important 
documents, "the publication of which would not necessarily cast

credibility," disappeared at the time Cernak left the party. 
Cernak went on to say that, when the new SNS chairman took 
office, he asked him to take over all of the documents according 
to a list in the safe. When leaving the party, he handed over 
to SNS First Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska documents that he 
himself had taken over and other important documents that should 
be filed by the SNS. According to Cernak, the specific document 
mentioned at the SNS briefing was the minutes of a meeting 
between SNS representatives and the then presidential candidate 
Michal Kovac, which cannot bind the president in any way and 
cannot be misused. After the signing of the coalition agreement 
with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, the proposal was 
made that this document be sent to the president. "I physically 
destroyed those minutes because their contents had become 
irrelevant. I would never use them in the way described by 
Peter Sokol, nor could they be used in such a way," Cernak added.

<F P=106> [Article by "su": "Slovak Television Council's Protest"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--At an extraordinary news conference 
yesterday, members of the Slovak Television Council made 
available to reporters a statement that expresses disagreement 
with the amendment to the Law on Slovak Television that is on 
the agenda of today's plenary meeting of the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic. In the opinion of the Council, "if 
parliament approves the proposed change to the Law on Slovak 
Television, it will mean the liquidation of the principles of 
independence, nonpartisanship, and professionalism," the 
statement says. 
  The amendment provides for the dissolution of the present 
Slovak Television Council, which is based on the principle of 
the civic spectrum of interests. Council members assess this 
step as expedient, motivated by economic and preelection 
considerations. Jergus Ferko emphasized the status of the 
Council as the steering body of Slovak Television with 
jurisdiction over not only programs but also the economic sphere 
of managing television as a public corporation. He voiced the 
fear that the structure of the future Council will be based on 
the principle of the majority representation of political 
parties, which would unequivocally politicize Slovak Television 
and liquidate its independence. "If the principle is applied of 
forming the Slovak Television Council on the party principle, it 
will be a short-term expedient measure, which will lead to 
permanent liquidations of the Slovak Television Council after 
every change in the balance of forces in the parliament. It 
would be a systemic step back, toward a situation that has been 
overcome by developments, which will only raise political 
tension and intensify the already serious problems of Slovak 
Television inherited from the past," the statement goes on to 
say. 
  The Council deplored that its members had not been invited 
to 
the work on drafting a new Law on Slovak Television and to the 
relevant meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
Education, Science, and Culture Committee. It called this 
behind-the-scenes course of action illegal and unprecedented.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonia Vymazalova: "Imports Only With a </F>
Certificate"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The first item on the agenda of the 
government session, chaired by Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik 
yesterday, was the National Council of the Slovak Republic bill 
on certain measures to prevent increasing insolvency in the 
Slovak Republic. The government returned the bill for 
alterations. If it passed the bill in its current form, there 
would be the threat of a slowdown of the privatization process 
and the formation of an obstacle to enterprise. 
  The government discussed and approved several proposals for 
intergovernment agreements and documents, among them the draft 
Agreement Between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the 
Government of the Croatian Republic on the Extradition and 
Admission of Citizens. It also approved the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic's bill on customs. At a news conference 
during the government session, Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko 
said that the customs law deals in a completely new way with the 
organization of the customs administration and its status with 
respect to other bodies, duties, powers, and resources of the 
customs officer, the rights and obligations of natural and legal 
persons toward customs officers. He emphasized that the law 
gives greater powers to customs officers and even enables them 
to use some restrictive measures. 
  The government approved its work schedule and its plan of 
legislative work until 30 September 1994. It agreed to the 
schedule of carrying out work ensuing from the report on the 
state of the Department of Agriculture and the economic 
conditions for the implementation of the intentions for this 
year. It also approved a directive on one-time extraordinary 
compensation of between 10,000 and 50,000 Slovak korunas for an 
injury or death in the course of working for the civilian 
defense. 
  It approved an amendment to the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic Law No. 83/1991 on the work of Slovak Republic 
bodies in the implementation of the employment policy according 
to earlier regulations. The bill submitted makes payments from 
the Slovak Employment Fund for financing work beneficial to the 
public also available to state budget and subsidized 
organizations, which the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
Law No. 325/1993 ruled out. The proposed amendment does not 
affect the state budget. The government disagreed with a 
deputy's draft extensively amending the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic Law No. 325/1993 on the state budget of the 
Slovak Republic for 1994 and changes to other laws. 
  The government acknowledged the report on guaranteeing the 
offer of property in the second wave of coupon privatization. 
It contains, among other things, the criteria for the selection 
of enterprises offering property in the coupon privatization, a 
proposal of the schedule for the preparation of the offer, and 
the implementation of the actual process of distribution of the 
shares. "The relevant minister will prepare by 20 May 1994, in 
cooperation with the founding ministries, a list of the 
enterprises included in the coupon privatization. The volume 
will thus be determined with added precision of property 
included in the second wave of coupon privatization," Minister 
Milan Janicina said at a news conference. The government also 
acknowledged informative documentation on the preparation for 
the introduction of a compulsory certification of farm and food 
products in the Slovak Republic beginning on 1 May 1994. As 
Minister Peter Magvasi stated, because four conditions were not 
satisfied for calling off the 1 May date, exporters of food 
products will have to present a certificate from the country to 
which they are exporting. According to the agreement in effect, 
the government can no longer change the date of compulsory 
certification of farm and food products in the Slovak Republic 
because it is given by approval in the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic. The government authorized Minister Magvasi to 
discuss the issue with his Czech counterpart, Dlouhy.

  [Text] The issuing of certificates, which are very closely 
linked to the customs union between the Czech and Slovak 
Republics, has political aspects, too, although the economic 
aspects prevail. 
  This is what Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said in 
connection with the problem surrounding certificates required 
for foodstuffs imported from the Czech Republic into Slovakia. 
At the same time, he said that what is important is that the 
two sides have a political interest in preserving mutual 
cooperation and mutual links at least at the present level. He 
did not rule out the possibility, however, that the current 
cooperation in this form could cease to be convenient for either 
side.

  [Text] The Customs Union and the Payments Agreement with 
the Czech Republic are disadvantageous for Slovakia in many 
respects. This is what Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita 
Schmoegnerova said at a news conference in Bratislava today. 
She said, however, that the one to blame for this situation is 
not the Czech partner, which is naturally asserting its own 
interests, but the former Slovak Government, which was not 
properly prepared to conclude these agreements. Schmoegnerova 
added that the Slovak Cabinet will deal with this issue in the 
near future.

<F P=106> [Article by "ip": "Inflation Slowing, Reserves Growing; Good </F>
News From the Slovak National Bank Directorate"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Yesterday's meeting of the Slovak 
National Bank [NBS] Directorate considered the main trends of 
monetary development to be favorable, NBS Vice Governor Marian 
Jusko said after the meeting. 
  The rate of inflation continued to slow in March. It went up 
0.5 percent in March and 2.6 percent since the beginning of the 
year. According to preliminary data, the money supply expressed 
in terms of the M2 aggregate declined by 5 billion korunas [Sk] 
in March, compared with February. In terms of the M1 aggregate 
(money in circulation and nonterm deposits), it declined by 
Sk4.2 billion. The aggregate volume of primary deposits declined 
by Sk6.1 billion in March, which was caused, to a decisive 
extent, by the deadline for filing tax returns [last day of 
March]. 
  Refinancing credits declined by Sk2.5 billion in March. The 
state budget deficit was reduced by Sk700 million and amounted 
to Sk4.5 billion as of 27 April. The government's net position 
vis-a-vis the banking system is approximately Sk60 billion. 
  The NBS's foreign exchange reserves are growing gradually. 
At the beginning of January, they stood at $340.17 million, in 
mid-February at $350 million, by 23 March at $427.54 million, 
and by 21 April at $536.4 million (all these figures exclude 
gold reserves). The share of new loans in the increase has been 
minimal; purchases from commercial banks at the foreign exchange 
fixing have been decisive. The entire banking sector availed 
itself of foreign exchange reserves of $1.896 billion as of 20 
April. 
  The deficit on the clearing account with the Czech Republic 
is declining. At the end of December 1993, Slovakia had a 
deficit of 168.9 million XCU's [clearing European Currency 
Units] (Sk6.6 billion), at the end of January 1994 a deficit of 
176.1 million XCU's (Sk6.9 million), and at the end of February 
a deficit of 125.9 million XCU's (Sk5.4 billion). By 1 April, 
the deficit dropped to 59.9 million XCU's (Sk2.3 billion), by 15 
April to 42.1 million XCU's, and by 27 April to 12 million XCU's 
(Sk489.4 million). 
  NBS Vice Governor Marian Jusko said that the NBS measures to 
reduce the amount of money in circulation, made necessary by the 
rapid increase in the state budget deficit in the last two weeks 
of last year, fulfilled their purpose and that the granting of 
refinancing credits is gradually being renewed. Promissory 
notes to finance agriculture have started being rediscounted 
[reeskontovat] again. The Sk500 million, which is the limit set 
aside for this purpose, should help bridge the shortage of funds 
in laying foundations for the new harvest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Corneliu Coposu, chairman of the National </F>
Peasant Christian-Democratic Party, by Irinel Radulescu and Ralu 
Filip; place and date not given: "The Solution to Our Overcoming 
the Crisis Is a Cooperation Government"] 
  [Text] [CURIERUL NATIONAL] For a start we would like to 
ask you to make an assessment of the current political situation. 
  [Coposu] Currently our country is facing an economic crisis 
that is close to a catastrophe. One could say that it has 
entered the phase of economic collapse. In my opinion, however, 
the principal crisis is the moral one. Besides the political 
and social crisis, besides the economic one, which everyone 
perceives, I believe that the gravest crisis currently facing 
Romania is the moral one. That crisis has been caused by the 
postrevolutionary governments' obvious inability to direct the 
country toward the restructuring of its democratic institutions 
and the establishment of a free economy. All the attempts made 
by the governments that have been ruling the country since 
December 1989 -- which all lacked a program and which tried to 
compensate for their failure in administering public affairs by 
supplying economic-social program strategies, that is, in 
practical terms, merely a listing of goals -- have failed to 
yield any positive results. On top of that, it was all followed 
by a series of bills of a Marxist-Leninist nature that made the 
government look like a new hardline communist 
nomenklatura. All the bills there have been have 
loopholes and present a series of deficiencies that became 
obvious after those bills became effective. For instance, in 
1990 they refused to elaborate a bill on the restitution of 
land. Now they are refusing to elaborate the bill on the 
restitution of urban real estate. I mean, they promoted 
imperfect laws, beginning with the Constitution. This situation, 
interwoven with their lack of political will to implement 
democratic reform and the transition toward market economy has 
generated this crisis.... 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You asserted that all post-December 
bills have loopholes. This takes us by surprise, considering 
that some of them were sanctioned by the representatives of the 
PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] and, 
generally, by those of the CDR [Democratic Convention of 
Romania] as well.... 
  [Coposu] That is right, the opposition representatives have 
not always adopted negative-oriented stances. Among the 
hundreds of negative things it has done, the government has also 
managed to accomplish certain good things that enjoyed the 
opposition's support. Ours is a firm stance, as we already 
asserted when the current government took office. We promised 
that we would support all democratic initiatives, everything 
that stands for progress and is directed toward establishing 
democracy. This is why we have always reacted positively to all 
signals that indicate a tendency toward democratization and 
privatization. We have opposed, however, all attempts -- which, 
as a matter of fact, eventually succeeded owing to their 
majority in parliament, which is ensured by the extremist 
parties -- that oppose democracy and the rules of the market 
economy. One such example would be the taxes foreseen for the 
farmers' incomes. Such taxes represent a tremendous gaffe, and 
will have serious consequences upon the government. It is a 
gaffe in which we played no part, but rather walked out of 
parliament hall so that we could not be connected, even 
indirectly, with that abhorrent law. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Let us return to the crisis. In your 
estimation, how could it be overcome? 
  [Coposu] There is no way out of this crisis other than by 
altering the structure of the majority in parliament and by the 
government's expressing and also implementing its will to 
accomplish reform. Currently no such will is available, and we 
are turning about and about in a vicious circle of positive 
affirmations and praiseworthy intentions regarding reform, but 
which, however, are never applied in practice or followed by 
concrete steps intended to achieve transition. How can we 
overcome this crisis? In my opinion, considering the lack of 
will on the part of the executive bodies and, especially, of 
President Iliescu to renounce his monopoly over the authority he 
very firmly holds in state matters, all negotiations with the 
opposition are useless. They are merely a waste of time. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Today quite a number of political 
analysts consider that the opposition made a mistake after the 
elections held in the fall of 1992, when it rejected the PDSR's 
[Social Democracy Party of Romania] offer to jointly set up a 
coalition government. Similarly, now they are also criticizing 
the then intention of the CDR to push the PDSR into the arms of 
the left wing and the nationalist-extremist parties. What is 
your opinion on this? 
  [Coposu] The reason for our refusal was different. 
Accepting the responsibility of ruling means to have access to 
the levers of power and to be able to implement one's own 
program. The experience of the PNL [National Liberal Party] was 
eloquent in this sense, as they participated in the Stolojan 
cabinet without being allowed to appoint any of its members as 
public servants. I mean, if they put at the opposition's 
disposal the office of interior minister, for instance, and give 
that person a ministerial salary, a chauffeured limousine, and a 
villa in the Primaverii district, the problem will still remain 
unresolved. Such a minister should be given full authority to 
reorganize its ministry down to the lowest level. Otherwise the 
supporters of neo-communism in his ministry might resort to 
sabotage. 
  What we asked for could easily have been fulfilled. We 
asked for full authority to implement their programs for all 
portfolio holders of the ministries entrusted to the opposition. 
They, however, refused. We said: "If you do not wish to share 
power with us, you cannot share responsibility either, so why 
don't you keep it for yourselves alone. As long as you behave 
democratically, we will support you. The moment you come up 
with law-making initiatives that endanger democracy, we will 
stop supporting you." Thus, they denied us access to the levers 
of power. Under such circumstances, we could not cooperate with 
them. My party cannot participate in a government with three 
ministers while power is actually held by Mr. Iliescu. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Are you really convinced that Mr. 
Iliescu has full control over PDSR? 
  [Coposu] No, I am not. But he is inclined to wish to 
control the progress of life in all domains of activity down to 
the minutest detail. Such is his tendency, but I have no way of 
knowing the extent to which he is also being sabotaged by his 
own party, the former Securitate, and the current SRI [Romanian 
Intelligence Service]. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You said that the solution to overcome 
the crisis would be to alter the majority in parliament. How 
could that be achieved? 
  [Coposu] There are two angles to this issue. First, I 
believe it will be very difficult for them to continue ruling 
with the current parliament. I consider it similarly difficult 
to achieve a different majority with the political spectrum 
currently existing in parliament. And yet, how could a 
different majority still be achieved? By means of a future 
cooperation, rather than an alliance government. Cooperation is 
something that could be done even by political groupings with 
contradicting programs and diametrically opposed ideologies. 
What does cooperation mean? It means the temporary cessation 
of the parties' own initiatives, on the basis of a minimal 
program, accepted by everyone, and intended to overcome a 
difficult moment that has emerged in the ruling of the country. 
Therefore, theoretically speaking, such cooperation could be 
achieved by the PDSR's appointing a number of its own delegates, 
which should be in accordance with the people's 
updated option, while, on the other hand, 
representatives of the opposition parties should be appointed, 
similarly, in accordance with the proportion held by each of 
those parties in the people's updated option, all those 
representatives ensuring the functioning of a department each. 
All departments should be left entirely to the care of their 
leaders, without any meddling on the part of any of the other 
factors. After having attempted to overcome the crisis 
situation, a balance is to be drawn up to single out all those 
who have not complied with their duties and to make them assume 
responsibility for their inability to govern. This is what 
cooperation means. And it could be achieved if the group of the 
moderates within the PDSR were stronger and could impose its 
point of view on the group of radicals. However, currently the 
radicals are terrorizing the moderates and compelling them to 
submit to the measures they dictate. The best proof of this is 
the fact that persons who were considered moderates, under the 
terror of the radicals, meanwhile changed their stance and have 
swung to the other extreme. Mr. Adrian Nastase [executive 
chairman of the PDSR] has become more radical than the radicals 
themselves, because he knows that the majority of the party 
tolerates him merely because of Mr. Iliescu's insistence. If the 
group of moderates could impose its own views, then they, 
together with the opposition and perhaps with the PD-FSN 
[Democratic Party-National Salvation Front], of which I do not 
know whether they would participate or rather merely support 
such a government, the alteration of the parliamentary majority 
could be achieved. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Lately you have frequently mentioned the 
idea of holding early elections. On what grounds do you venture 
to make such assertions? 
  [Coposu] I see no way in which the current parliament could 
go on functioning until the mandate entrusted to it by the 
nation expires. And it is my belief that if no early elections 
are to be held this fall, they will certainly have to take place 
next spring. Early elections are always determined by the 
inability to overcome crisis situations. Well, our current 
government does not even have a program to overcome the crisis. 
Look at their [1994] draft budget.... It is full of nonsense 
and illusory provisions. It hopes for state spending to be 
covered by borrowing 800 billion lei from the nation. I wonder, 
will anyone in Romania be ready to credit the Vacaroiu 
government with such an amount? 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You mentioned the moderates and the 
radicals within the PDSR. Would a rift between those two wings 
be beneficial for our political life, or rather not? 
  [Coposu] That rift will occur and it will doubtlessly 
strengthen the left. If one were to examine the political 
concept of the parliamentary majority, one would find that they 
are former communists who have now declared themselves 
democrats. There is no difference whatsoever between Mr. 
Verdet's [chairman of the Socialist Party of Labor -- PSM] 
chamber of deputy members and those of the majority in 
parliament. They have the same type of mentality and they are 
similarly unable to break through the shell of their 
Marxist-Leninist way of thinking. Such a rift within the PDSR 
would be welcome to clear things up once and for all. However, 
it is important that the wing that breaks off should not be a 
majority one, because this would come to prove the label we have 
given to the PDSR, namely that it is a crypto-communist party. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Judging by your reasoning you seem to 
be more interested in the rift itself than in anything else. 
Have you ever considered the risks it would imply? On the one 
hand, the minority of the moderates could be absorbed by the 
opposition, while, on the other hand, the left wing would be 
strengthened by helping itself to the PDSR structures. 
  [Coposu] In this phase of confusion we are currently going 
through, one needs to get one thing straight. The important 
thing in any multiparty system is that there should be a 
powerful opposition, even if it is a left-wing one. Who is 
stopping us from having the current opposition run the country 
with the left wing in the opposition? In the current phase, in 
our transition toward a market economy, it might even prove to 
be beneficial to have a left-wing opposition throttle tendencies 
to wild capitalism. There has to be a crystallization of the 
situation regardless of the sacrifice and I believe that it 
would be better if the radical half of the PDSR joined the 
communists, so that at least one would know who one has to deal 
with. But of course, such crystallization implies perils.... 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Do you think that the opposition is able 
to handle such perils? 
  [Coposu] The opposition is structured upon certain persons 
who left their prison cells with their pockets empty and their 
assets confiscated. They had no access to radio, or television, 
and could not have their programs circulated by the press. If 
you want to have the press, you need money. Only I know what 
hardships we have to put up with to keep the daily DREPTATEA 
afloat, considering its 7-8 million lei monthly deficit. The 
opposition is poor, but I limit that to the CDR, because the 
others, such as the PD-FSN have already been in power, so they 
were able to make some money. They have their own press. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] In connection with the crystallization 
needed within the PDSR, do you think that this process should be 
extended over the CDR, as well? 
  [Coposu] It would be childish if I asserted that there are 
no divergences within the CDR. However, our democratic 
conception compels us to the unanimous acceptance of the ideas 
supported by the majority. The CDR consists of eight parties 
and 10 political groupings that do not have a party character. 
This means 18 determining factors, each with its own identity 
and political ideology. The criteria at the basis of the 
setting up of this alliance is a minimal program, a platform 
containing certain very restricted points. 
  [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Even with that minimum program, the CDR 
member parties have disagreed, at crucial moments, in 
parliament.... 
  [Coposu] They did, doubtlessly. A common denominator is 
inconceivable. It is right to have divergent points. And there 
is divergence among the CDR members and among the parliamentary 
factions of the opposition. However, each of those parties 
realizes that if it were to leave the CDR, it would immediately 
be annihilated and doomed to disappear from our political life. 
The fate of Mr. Campeanu [former chairman of the National 
Liberal Party] and his party can prove it.

<F P=106> [Article by Clementina Filip and Daniel Uncu: "The PD-PDSR </F>
Bilateral Negotiations Have Concluded for Good"] 
  [Text] It seems that the efforts made by the opposition to 
convince the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] to attempt 
a possible modification of the parliamentary majority have 
failed. The result of the last round of PD [Democratic 
Party]-PDSR talks, which was held yesterday, 26 April at the 
headquarters of the Senate, can be summed up through Adrian 
Nastase's [executive president of the PDSR] statement: "The 
talks have concluded for good!" 
  Sources of the negotiating teams revealed that, in the 
attempt to divert attention from the major objective of the 
negotiations (that is, the modification in the parliamentary 
majority) the ruling party proposed that a draft accord 
regarding the political conduct and cooperation between the 
parliamentary parties and the PDSR, as well as a draft economic 
and social program for 1994 that was to be examined by experts 
of other parties, should be discussed. The PD negotiators 
believed that the ruling party's proposals regarding previous 
demands of the opposition and of Mr. Roman's party were 
insufficient and inopportune. Therefore, eventually, the sides 
proceeded to discussions on the issue of parliamentary 
restructuring. The same sources revealed that the PDSR took 
into consideration the variation in which the PUNR [Romanian 
National Unity Party] should be one of the balancing factors of 
this majority. In turn, the PD negotiators rejected the 
proposal, which they considered inadequate from the opposition's 
viewpoint. Considering that the power of invention of the PDSR 
is unlimited when it comes to political "arrangements," they 
proposed that the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic 
Party] together with the PD and the PDSR should participate in a 
possible government formula. Not being able to start 
negotiations on behalf of the PNTCD, the PD proposed a summit 
meeting with all leaders of the opposition (in spite of the 
PDSR's aversion to the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
and the Liberal Party '93), a meeting that should create the 
common ground for discussions. 
  In practical terms, in this way, these negotiations could 
continue endlessly if the ruling party is not determined to take 
a clear decision. 
  Here are the statements of those who carried out the 
negotiations: 
  Ion Solcanu, representing the PDSR: "This stage of the 
negotiations has to conclude with a proper examination of the 
economic and political situation in our country. Likewise, our 
talks identify the necessary solutions to overcome the current 
deadlock. The dialogue might be extended to other opposition 
parties as well." 
  Adrian Severin, representing the PD: "As far as we are 
concerned, we cannot accept political bigamy. We cannot accept 
that the PDSR cooperates with the parties included in the 
current pentagon [PDSR, PUNR, Greater Romania Party, Socialist 
Party of Labor, and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania] 
and, at the same time, with the opposition parties, in a 
possible parliamentary or government formula. The PDSR has 
still not succeeded in understanding the fact that it is not 
possible to propel the country toward democracy together with 
extremist parties or nostalgic-restoration parties. The talks 
have concluded for good, in spite of our efforts."

  [Text] Bucharest, April 29 (AFP) -- Former King Mihai of 
Romania on Friday [29 April] accused Romanian authorities of 
preventing him from visiting his homeland for this weekend's 
Orthodox Easter celebrations, saying it was acting out of fear. 
  "Despite their promises, those who govern you, who have not 
overcome their fear of the links which exist between you and I, 
are not allowing me to celebrate Easter with you, in Timisoara," 
the former king said in a message to Romanians. 
  The 72-year-old former king said he felt bitter that his 
country's leaders were "upholding the unjust decision" taken 
more than 40 years ago. 
  The king was forced to abdicate in 1947 and the communist 
regime took away his Romanian citizenship a year later. 
  On Thursday, the former king said too many "restrictive 
conditions" had been imposed on him by the Romanian authorities 
for him to be able to visit. 
  "My fate is in your hands. My return to my country depends 
on each and every one of you," he said in his message. He had 
not lost hope of being able to return to Romania, he added. 
  Since the Romanian revolution in 1989, the former king, who 
lives in exile in Switzerland, has only once been allowed to 
return to Romania, for Easter 1992. He was welcomed by large 
crowds. 
  The government was on Friday criticised by certain sections 
of the Romanian press, who said it had no respect for people's 
rights when those rights conflicted with its interests. 
  The authorities imposed a series of conditions on the former 
king's proposed visit and insisted that he go to a town other 
than Timisoara, the place where the 1989 revolution began and 
whose mayor is a member of the opposition. 
  Presidential spokesman Traian Chebeleu said the authorities 
had shown good will and had no responsibility for the 
cancellation of the visit. 
  The authorities' refusal to allow the former king to attend 
festivities last December caused a political storm and the 
opposition boycotted official celebrations in protest.

  [Text] ROMPRES agency received a fax with a message to the 
country by former sovereign Mihai of Romania regarding the visit 
he was going to pay to Romania to, quote, jointly pray for the 
country, unquote. According to the message, the presence of the 
former sovereign would have guaranteed civic and moral peace as 
well as the spiritual peace that the country needs in order to 
come out of self-doubt, discouragement, and fear. Considering 
that the unjust decision on his exclusion -- a decision taken 
more than 40 years ago by the leaders of the communist coup 
d'etat -- is also upheld at the highest state levels today, 
Mihai of Romania announces that he does not want to lose hope 
and, along with the Christian formula of Christ Is Reborn, adds: 
It is high time that your patience should bear fruit. The 
message continues, quote: My fate is in your hands. It is up 
to each one of you whether I can return home. The time has come 
that, after sacrifices and suffering, we should be again 
together, for our fatherland's revival. 
  In connection with the message sent by Romania's former king 
on the Holy Easter holidays, a message which contains several 
references to his cancellation of his visit to Romania, the 
Romanian spokesperson was authorized to state the following: As 
announced, the Romanian Government has expressed its regret that 
the invitation it has sent to the former king -- for the first 
time since the abolition of the monarchy -- to pay a private 
visit to Romania on the occasion of the Holy Easter holidays 
this year was not met with an appropriate response, despite the 
fact that the government has shown itself ready to ensure the 
proper organization and development of the visit. 
Unfortunately, the former king's message clearly reveals the 
true reasons for his refusal to accept the government's 
proposals, which were made in the context of strict observation 
of the country's constitutional provisions. 
  The real aim of the visit, as it resulted from the text of 
the message, was to create conditions for his comeback on 
Romania's political scene, something which directly contradicts 
his previous statements, whereby the former king said that he 
wants to pay a private visit and does not challenge the 
constitutional order. Moreover, the message contains inciting 
calls, capable of disturbing the public quiet and law and order 
in the country, the communique points out. The government 
intends to exert its prerogatives, by strictly observing the 
principles and norms of the rule-of-law state, as sanctioned by 
Romania's Constitution, in order to ensure a climate of quiet 
and public order, which are so necessary for the further 
democratization of our political and social life. 
  Therefore, the government cannot accept -- in any form or 
under any pretext -- such actions, which may jeopardize the 
constitutional order in the country. The government is firmly 
determined to treat any future intent of the former king to 
visit Romania in the same way, only on the basis of a clear 
commitment by the latter to observe the constitutional order in 
Romania.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Van den Broek, European Commission </F>
member for external political relations, by Josef Vesely in 
Prague on 28 April: "The Requirements for Admission Into the 
European Union Are Clear, Says the Belgian Commissioner"] 
  [Text] Prague--The criteria for admitting countries like 
the Czech Republic into the European Union have been 
sufficiently clear since the Copenhagen summit of the so-called 
Twelve last June. This statement was made yesterday by Hans Van 
den Broek, European Commission member for external political 
relations, in an interview granted to MLADA FRONTA DNES 
following a symposium organized by the Konrad Adenauer 
Foundation and the Bohemia Foundation. 
  He added that the basic requirements for admission consist 
of 
stability in the institutions guaranteeing democracy, the 
existence of a law-governed state, the observation of human 
rights, protection for minorities, and the ability to come to 
terms with the competitive pressures of the market within the 
Union. The candidate must also identify with the aims of the 
Union. 
  "We will no longer place new requirements on the candidates 
from your region because you would consider this to be an 
obstacle. And perhaps this would also bolster certain 
nationalist and sectarian tendencies. Moreover, there is also 
another side to the coin--the Union's further enlargement 
depends on our ability to absorb new members at the appropriate 
moment," said Van den Broek. 
  [Vesely] How do you perceive the obligation to identify with 
the aims of the European Union? 
  [Van den Broek] Each country that wants to become a member 
will be invited to sign a whole set of regulations, laws, and 
obligations, including the Maastricht Treaty. This defines the 
future of Europe. We also want to develop new spheres of 
cooperation here. Among other things, we intend to establish a 
monetary union and formulate common security and foreign policy. 
Later, we should move on from coordinating defense policy to a 
real common defense. 
  [Vesely] Of course, it may transpire that a specific country 
will not want to commit itself so heavily. 
  [Van den Broek] If someone were to tell us that he has 
difficulty in fulfilling this or that aspect and, therefore, 
that, at the moment, he is only interested in the economic or 
trade aspect, or, as the case may be, that he has not yet 
sufficiently adapted his laws to those valid in the European 
Union, then I believe it would be possible to reach an agreement 
with him on conditional admission. A transitional period would 
be determined, during which the issue would be resolved. 
However, in no way would it be acceptable to us if a candidate 
were not to adopt as his own the fundamental principles on which 
the European Union is based. And it will not be at all possible 
for him to refuse to share our final political aims, aims 
derived from everything that has already been achieved. 
  [Vesely] What do you think of the suggestions to establish a 
kind of intermediate stage that would bridge the period between 
association and full membership? 
  [Van den Broek] Our immediate aim is to put into practice 
everything on which we have already reached agreement. We will 
certainly still have a great deal of work with this, especially 
in intensifying the political dialogue. The European Union, 
therefore, has proposed, for example, that a meeting be held 
annually involving the heads of government, foreign ministers, 
and, as the case may be, the policy directors of ministries. We 
want to have joint working groups to deal with specific foreign 
and security policy issues. Here, we are distinctly aware of the 
common interest of the Czech Republic and the other Central and 
East European countries, on the one hand, and the European 
Union, on the other.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Zahorka, of the CR Agricultural Chamber: </F>
"Intervention Purchases of Wheat Have Begun"] 
  [Text] The Council of the State Fund of Market Regulation 
decided at the end of 1993 to purchase foodstuffs wheat from 
this year's harvest through the form of so-called time-limited 
intervention purchases. These purchases are time-restricted 
because, as early as spring of this year, contracts will be 
concluded for the purchase of foodstuffs wheat, with the 
deadline for delivery to coincide with the harvest period. On 
the basis of such agreements, down payments amounting to 50 
percent of the value of the deliveries are to be paid as early 
as this month. 
  The council decided on the above method of purchasing 
following the experiences of last year's harvest, when the fund 
purchased only an insignificant quantity of foodstuffs wheat, 
with which it was totally unable to influence the situation on 
the market. Other buyers had simply paid more than the fund, 
which is authorized to purchase at the so-called minimum 
(guaranteed) price or to pay in advance, even if those payments 
were at a lower price. The fund failed to purchase a significant 
amount of wheat, despite the fact that the minimum (guaranteed) 
price before the harvest rose significantly. 
<H5>  The Market and the Import of Grain </H5>
  In view of the fact that the fund virtually purchased no 
wheat from the 1993 harvest, it did not even have any stockpiles 
with which it could have blunted the increase in the consumer 
price of flour, baked goods, and even fodder grains for 
production consumption in livestock production. The desire to 
have such stockpiles at its disposal was also the sole motive 
for the decision of the fund council regarding imports. This 
decision actually halted the rise in grain prices. And it did so 
even before the actual importation of a single kilogram of 
foodstuffs wheat. The effect developed even in the face of 
subsequent announcements that these imports represent current 
imports at market prices abroad, including customs duties. The 
Ministry of Finance merely adopted measures according to which 
the customs duties are assessed but not collected for the time 
being. Such procedures are valid until such times as the 
minister of agriculture submits (in the case of need) a proposal 
to forgo such duties; the proposal is submitted to the 
government, which makes the final decision. 
  The Ministry of Finance was motivated in this direction 
primarily by the virtual balance between grain resources and 
requirements in the Czech Republic, including foodstuffs wheat. 
Another reason was the fact that the difference between the 
market price of this wheat at the time on our domestic market 
(3,500-3,700 korunas [Kc] per metric ton) and the cost of 
possible imports, including customs duties of approximately 
Kc4,200 per ton, was not considered an impenetrable barrier in 
terms of foodstuffs consumer prices. For example, such a price 
increase for wheat would show up in the consumer prices of 
crescent rolls only to the extent of 10 halers. There was thus 
no reason that foodstuffs wheat could not be sold on our markets 
at prices of its possible import costs, including customs duties. 
  Despite the effect of this procedure, it must be said that 
the fund for the importation of agricultural products was never 
conceived. It is supposed to purchase interventional stockpiles 
on the domestic market when prices paid to farmers are lower 
than the minimum (guaranteed) price and is thus supposed to 
assist in revitalizing farm prices and not to import stockpiles 
when market prices are higher than the minimum (guaranteed) 
price. In the latter case, it then acts against the interest of 
farmers; in the event the forgiveness of customs duties is not 
subsidized, consumer prices on the domestic market would not 
even benefit consumers or processors. 
  Thus, in discussing procedures for the year 1994, the fund 
council was faced by a decision: either to engage in 
interventional purchases in a traditional manner at harvest 
time, with a great risk of repeating the situation of last year, 
or to conclude contracts for futures purchases, paying out 
deposits and thus adapting to the practices used by a number of 
buyers. The decision was made to buy time-limited futures. 
Regular analyses of the grain market indicate that the decision 
by the council has already influenced the conduct of the other 
buyers without the fund's having purchased a single kilogram of 
grain and without having concluded any futures contracts. Buyers 
are offering higher market prices than the minimum (guaranteed) 
price, lower-quality parameters than called for by tough export 
criteria for the fund; concluding contracts for futures 
purchases and paying down payments; using bills of exchange to 
make these payments; supplying agricultural chemicals with the 
provision that they will subtract their value from the 
compensation paid for grain delivered at harvest time; and so 
forth. 
<H5>  The Task of the Agricultural Chamber </H5>
  Because the conclusion of futures contracts to affect 
interventional purchases required that the offerings of growers 
be concentrated, the fund council asked the Agricultural Chamber 
of the Czech Republic for assistance. The agreement with the 
director of the fund regarding the most important criteria and 
conditions for purchases was aimed at at least allowing growers 
to more or less orient themselves and to begin, with the 
assistance of okres agricultural chambers, to make a listing of 
offerings. The first round of offerings took place as early as 
January so it would be possible to meet the deadline for making 
downpayments in March. The result was an offering that 
corresponds to the quantity of 500,000 tons being considered by 
the council. 
  The procedures adopted by the okres agricultural chambers, 
however, encountered the criticism of some members of the fund 
council. They were calling on their findings in the field, which 
indicated that some growers did not find out about the 
possibility for interventional purchases and, in some locations, 
allegedly even refused to register their offerings in the 
listing (although this involved a grower who is capable of 
producing foodstuffs wheat) because the individual involved 
allegedly was not a member of the agricultural chamber. But this 
was never proved. 
  Therefore, the agricultural chambers organized a second 
round 
of listings, the results of which (halfway through February) 
already amounted to approximately 50,000 tons more than was 
being considered by the council. Therefore, the offerings were 
curtailed by the Commodity Council of the Agricultural Chamber 
at okres levels according to the actual quantities of foodstuffs 
wheat purchased over the past three years, according to 
production in recent years and the listing of areas sown to 
wheat. However, such an offering was again rejected by the fund 
council, with a reference to the fact that there is a need to 
leave room for the registration of growers. Therefore, a third 
round of offerings was conducted, which ended on 25 February. 
<H5>  A Systems or Nonsystems Approach </H5>
  The principal effect of any kind of interventional 
purchases--in other words, even of futures purchases--is to 
influence market prices paid to farmers and the conduct of 
buyers in the market. A secondary effect of futures intervention 
purchases is the payment of deposits and, thus, the payment of 
advances to growers for their expenses for the next harvest. 
  From the standpoint of the principal effect, therefore, it 
is 
completely immaterial in terms of price levels whether a 
purchase for intervention purposes is actually made from any one 
specific grower. Moreover, a specific grower does not care at 
all whether a deposit is paid by the fund or by another buyer. 
After all, another buyer can (and frequently does) contract for 
even more advantageous conditions than the fund. In some 
okreses, particularly in production okreses, this was reflected 
in low offerings made to the fund. The fact that there have now 
been three rounds of listing offerings, however, also leads to 
the fact that, particularly in the less productive okreses, 
offerings are obviously no longer being made with the intention 
of actually delivering foodstuffs wheat, but with the secondary 
intent of borrowing financial resources without demonstrating 
their returnability to commercial banks or to the Supportive and 
Guaranteeing Agricultural and Forestry Fund. And the fund was 
not designed to effect an individual approach to every market 
entity (so no one could complain that he did not have the 
opportunity to participate in interventional purchases). One can 
thus believe that the current approach by the fund with respect 
to futures intervention purchases is based solely on a 
complicated financial situation faced by agricultural primary 
producers and on the fact that the measures are being asserted 
for the first time. After evaluating the experiences, this 
nonsystems approach will surely be transformed into a 
systems-type approach and will gain the right to exist.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof and Gregor Mayer; 
place and date not given: "I Ask You: Is This Liberal?"] 
  [Text] [PROFIL] Mr. Horn, are we talking to the future 
prime minister of Hungary? 
  [Horn] I do not know. This question is of little concern to 
me. We say that we do not commit ourselves to anything 
regarding this question before we get the election result. If I 
am correctly informed, there are 11 candidates for the office of 
prime minister in this country. Why should we increase their 
number? 
  [PROFIL] Over recent months your party has gained a degree 
of popularity, which is surprising to many. Is it also 
surprising to you? 
  [Horn] It makes one feel rather good. One sees that one's 
own political work has meaning. We are dealing with questions 
of the social restructuring of the economy, for which there is 
no recipe and where we are treading on virgin soil. Nowhere in 
the world is there an example of such rapid and massive 
privatization. One must not deal with ideologies in this 
matter. We decided the ideological issues during the second 
half of the 1980's when we passed laws on the multiparty 
parliamentary system and urged associated membership in the 
European Community and when I stated at the beginning of 1990 
that Hungary's security would be ensured within the framework of 
NATO. 
  [PROFIL] Four or five years ago most people would have 
assumed that the long communist rule would give rise to a long 
political quarantine for the Communist Parties and their 
successor organizations. Would you have believed at that time 
that you would get close to power so quickly again? 
  [Horn] Why do you use the term "Communist Party"? This is a 
term that is used by the right. I just want to remind you that 
on 7 October 1989 we founded the Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP). This party broke with the old state party, not only in 
ideological and political terms but also in practice. 
Therefore, I reject the adjective "communist," even though I 
have never denied that I was a communist. But one can develop 
also in this region, and not only in the West. 
  [PROFIL] Let us turn to the future. You have an economic 
program that is expressly liberal on economics. In the 
Socialist International you would be on the far right wing. 
  [Horn] This statement is not correct. Why should a program 
be liberal that says that one must no longer place the burdens 
of restructuring more or less one-sidedly on those who earn 
wages and salaries. Is a program liberal that calls for equal 
opportunities, that gives the state a greater role in the social 
field? I ask you: Is this liberal? 
  [PROFIL] So your party is not liberal. Is there anything on 
which you agree with the liberals, with whom you want to form a 
coalition? 
  [Horn] On the fact that the economy is in a disastrous 
situation. On the fact that the entrepreneurs are suffering 
under enormous taxes and burdens. However, this is also in 
harmony with the political ideas of the Socialist International. 
  [PROFIL] Thus, you would say that a government with 
socialist participation would be better for Hungarian 
entrepreneurs than a new edition of the current conservative 
government? 
  [Horn] Look, the majority of entrepreneurs have clearly 
indicated that they support the MSZP. For two reason: First, 
they want competent people in the government and, second, they 
want a predictable government policy. 
  [PROFIL] Is this support from the entrepreneurs also due to 
the fact that some former communists have become capitalists? 
  [Horn] The majority of communists did not join us. Those 
who had middle-echelon posts in the former state party founded 
small shareholding companies; they are not the owners or 
managing directors of large companies. 
  [PROFIL] In all the eastern Central European countries there 
is the problem of how one can get out of the mess. Do you think 
that the privatization of the Hungarian economy must be slowed 
down or accelerated.... 
  [Horn] It is not the speed that is the essential thing. In 
implementing privatization we would do two things in a 
fundamentally different way: First, we would once again make 
privatization subject to parliamentary control and, second, the 
point is not how much money a company is sold for -- the revenue 
is mostly used to close gaps in the budget anyway -- but that 
the new owner invests in modernization, preserves jobs, or 
creates them. The usual practice with the European Community 
is, however, that the company is closed down, the workers are 
dismissed, and the goods of the new owner stream into the 
country. Thus, in most cases a market is bought up, not just a 
company. 
  [PROFIL] Prime Minister Antall reportedly said on his death 
bed: "Only a Christian Hungary has a future." What kind of 
Hungary has a future, in your view? 
  [Horn] I was not present at Antall's death and, therefore, I 
cannot judge what he said. However, I know very well that most 
states in Europe do not define themselves as Christina 
countries. I believe that Christians and non-Christians, 
believers and non- believers, Hungarians and non-Hungarians all 
have their place in this country. Today it almost looks as if 
those who are not Christians, who are not believers, are a kind 
of second-class citizens. This is nonsense and has nothing to 
do with a European attitude.

  [Text] Skopje, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- Albanian paramilitary 
units in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] were in possession of "Stinger" missiles before they were 
disbanded by the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs in 
November 1993. 
  This was revealed today by VECER, a Skopje-based daily, 
which 
based its story on an account given by one of the main 
defendants, Hasan Agusi, former Yugoslav People's Army captain 
serving in the Marshall Tito barracks in Skopje until 1991. 
  According to Agusi, the Albanian paramilitary headquarters, 
which was based in Gostivar, paid 200,000 German marks to import 
weapons from Albania through Debar. The shipment consisted of 
200 Chinese-made Kalashnikovs.

  [Text] Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader held 
talks in Zagreb this evening with British Foreign Office 
Minister Douglas Hogg. 
  [Begin recording] [Hogg, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The Contact Group, to which I 
belong, is working out the details of bringing about a 
cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The basis for this is a signed 
agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina. When this issue is resolved the 
Contact Group will address the problems of the so-called Krajina. 
  We discussed the implementation of the Washington agreement 
today and concrete problems related to Krajina. The most 
difficult problem is the lack of negotiation, and how to make 
the parties communicate. Once they have begun talking results 
will be achieved, but -- I stress again -- the problem is that 
there is no dialogue. 
  [Sanader] We discussed the current situation in Croatia, 
regarding the UN Protected Areas and the steps that need to be 
taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I think that this was a very 
useful exchange of views. Minister Hogg presented some of his 
views -- he is to visit Sarajevo and Belgrade. I think this was 
a very useful exchange of information. We will probably meet 
again after his visits to Sarajevo and Belgrade, and President 
Tudjman will probably receive him. We have decided we must not 
stop now, but rather we must resume playing an active role as 
regards the final resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and, of course, in Croatia. 
  [Reporter] More precisely -- what did you discuss regarding 
the UN Protected Areas? Did you mention any steps which would 
lead to some improvements? 
  [Sanader] The minister was interested in our view on the 
current situation and I presented it to him. [end recording]

the Eastern bloc yesterday to discuss plans connected with the 
Partnership for Peace project and participation in peace 
missions. [passage omitted] 
  "Slovakia is interested in participating in tactical and 
command and staff exercises of larger dimensions, but not this 
year," Slovak Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, 
who represented the Slovak side, told the TA SR correspondent. 
For 1994, the Slovak Republic is preparing the exchange of 
smaller units, such as platoons and companies, at reciprocal 
exercises with other states of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council (NACC). "We cannot afford more, in view of the fact 
that only 1 percent of the Defense Ministry budget (that is, 104 
million Slovak korunas) has been earmarked for the 
implementation of the Partnership for Peace project," General 
Humaj noted. Julius Humaj also said that the Slovak Republic 
would present the presentation document for the Partnership for 
Peace program in May. "This document cannot be prepared in a 
few days or weeks," he said, reacting to comments by the NATO 
political leadership that the partner countries needed more time 
to draft the presentation document than had originally been 
expected. 
  Julius Humaj informed the NACC partners of the readiness of 
the Slovak Republic to make available, within the framework of 
Partnership for Peace, areas for training as well as training 
centers for the preparation of members of peacekeeping missions.

<F P=106> [Article by Matthias Rueb: "Romania Is Looking For Close </F>
Ties With the European Union"] 
  [Text] Bucharest, 29 April -- Romanian President Iliescu 
hopes that his country will receive financial compensation from 
the United Nations for about 12 billion German marks in damages 
that it has suffered as a result of sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro. The sanctions against Libya and Iraq, however, 
demonstrated that neighboring countries of the isolated states 
that suffered most did not receive any compensation. For 
Romania this means that, in a time of transition, which is 
difficult in itself, it has to cope with the loss of one of the 
most important and most developed trading partners and the 
blockade of many transit routes by itself, Iliescu said in an 
interview with this newspaper. 
  The future integration into the military and political 
alliances of the West remains an important foreign policy goal 
for Romania. Iliescu hopes that the association agreement 
between Romania and the European Union [EU] will be ratified by 
all EU member states by the end of this year. Bringing Romania 
close to the EU as an associated member is an important step for 
his country on the path toward full EU membership. In 
restructuring, Romania expects "economic partnership" with the 
developed Western countries. In the West much is being said 
about economic aid. Romania does not need charity but "normal, 
equal conditions for access to loans and modern technology" to 
stimulate the dynamism of economic growth in the East, Iliescu 
said. "We will be able to solve the problems here and in the 
West only together," the Romanian president stated. 
  Asked about the thinking in terms of so-called spheres of 
influence, which has become popular again recently, above all in 
Russia, Iliescu answered that the view, gained from historical 
experience, that there are big powers that determine politics 
and economy must be eliminated from the mentality of 
international politics. "We need a new democratic climate also 
at the international level, at the level of relations between 
the states, be they big or small," Iliescu demanded. 
  Regarding Romania's relations with Moldova, one must 
distinguish between historical ties and a new political reality, 
Iliescu said. At a "referendum" in March in the former Soviet 
Republic of Moldova, where two-thirds of its 4.5 million 
inhabitants are Russians, a majority voted for independence and 
closer ties with the CIS. Even though there are common roots, a 
common history, and a common language between Moldova and 
Romania, the existence of an independent Republic of Moldova, 
which owes its independence to the collapse of the Soviet 
Empire, is "a definite reality." From the very beginning 
Romania has supported the independence of "this second Romanian 
state." Iliescu expresses understanding for the efforts of the 
government in Chisinau to cultivate and expand the developed 
economic relations between Moldova and the former Soviet area as 
well as to establish normal political relations with its eastern 
neighbors. 
  In the Romanian president's view, it has been possible to 
stop the negative economic development in the country. For the 
first time in years of production decline, one can expect zero 
growth in 1994, Iliescu assumes. Last year all negative 
processes of structural change from the planned economy to the 
market economy accumulated: Today Romanian industry is working 
at about half- capacity. In contrast to the general assumption, 
Ceausescu's ambition to repay all of Romania's foreign debts did 
not bring the country any advantages but only disadvantages on 
the path toward a market economy. First, because the country 
and its infrastructure were impoverished as a result and, 
second, because as an unknown debtor Romania has greater 
problems getting foreign loans than its competitors on the money 
market. 
  Combating inflation, which was about 300 percent last year, 
and unemployment, which is 11 percent, is still the top priority 
of economic reforms. The "internal convertibility" of the leu, 
which was introduced a few weeks ago, has managed to make its 
exchange rate vis a vis Western currencies relatively stable, so 
that now there are hardly any differences between the official 
exchange rate and the black market rate. In addition, further 
"fiscal policy discipline measures" have meanwhile contained 
the inflation-promoting consequences of the introduction of 
value-added tax and the raising of the energy prices. According 
to Iliescu, the monthly inflation rate is now between 6 and 8 
percent; the 1994 annual rate might be between 70 and 80 
percent, according to the forecasts. The year 1994 will be a 
difficult one for the people and individual companies. Two 
periods of drought did great harm to agriculture so that in 1993 
Romania was forced to import even wheat. Iliescu expects a 
slight improvement in the microeconomic situation at the end of 
1994 at the earliest. 
  Asked about the problems of the former Romanian King Mihai 
from the House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in connection with 
entering the country, Iliescu tersely answered that Mihai may 
enter the country as a private person at any time. The former 
king had planned to travel to Romania for the orthodox Easter 
celebrations. Any trip by Mihai to Romania is a problem only if 
it serves as an excuse for social unrest. 
  In the Romanian president's view, relations between Romania 
and Germany are good. The signing of the German-Romanian treaty 
of friendship and cooperation by then Foreign Minister Genscher 
in Bucharest in April 1992 is the clearest sign of that. Germany 
supports Romania in its desire to become a member of the EU and 
NATO. At the same time, however, Iliescu hopes for additional 
economic and political signals from Germany. In Bucharest 
government circles one hears surprisingly often words of 
disappointment about the fact that high-ranking German 
politicians seem to ignore Romania on their trips to reforming 
countries in Central Europe. Bucharest has in vain waited for a 
visit by the chancellor since the revolution in December 1989. 
The last German chancellor to visit Romania was Kohl's 
predecessor Schmidt, who traveled to this country in 1978.

  [Text] The Hague, May 2 (CTK) -- Slovakia and Hungary today 
officially submitted their dispute over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
hydroelectric works to the International Court of Justice. 
  Slovakia accuses Hungary of not honoring the commitments it 
took on in the Czechoslovak-Hungarian agreement concluded in 
September 1977. Budapest blames Bratislava for undertaking 
unilateral steps, causing damage through restricting the flow in 
the Danube's original bed and negatively affecting the 
environment, The court is also to evaluate whether or not the 
1977 agreement is valid. 
  Hungary and Slovakia decided to turn to the international 
court in April 1993, after their talks on the issue were 
stalemated. A commission of experts from the European Union 
(EU) worked out an objective analysis of the issue. 
  Documents containing the two sides' arguments were brought 
to 
the court in two fully-packed vans. 
  The agreement to present the dispute to the International 
Court of Justice was reached by the two countries quite 
smoothly. Today's behavior of both Hungarian and Slovak 
representatives indicated that the former tension between 
Bratislava and Budapest has dwindled for the time being. The 
two countries also express their willingness to respect the 
court's decision. 
  However, the dispute is expected to drag on for long due to 
the controversial issue itself and the rightfulness of most 
arguments. The International Court will not decide on the 
problem before 1997, as first it has to solve another six big 
disputes. 
  The idea of damming the Danube in its Slovak-Hungarian 
border 
section first appeared in 1910. It was reappeared in 1950, but 
the agreement on the construction of a giant project was signed 
between Czechoslovak and Hungarian communist regimes only on 
September 15, 1977. In 1989 the Hungarian Parliament and 
government began to distance themselves from the project and 
later decided to halt the construction of its Hungarian part in 
Nagymaros. Slovakia completed the hydroelectric waterworks in 
Gabcikovo in late 1992.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- Introduction of 
preferential tariffs envisaged in the Central European Free 
Trade Agreement (CEFTA) will be accelerated under a 
supplementary protocol, signed in Budapest on Friday [29 April] 
by Hungarian International Economic Relations Minister Bela 
Kadar, Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, Polish 
International Economic Cooperation Minister Leslaw Podkanski, 
and Slovak Economic Minister Peter Magvasi. 
  Kadar later told reporters that the protocol leaves the 
agreement essentially unchanged, with only customs elimination 
deadlines modified. Accordingly, duties on CEFTA goods -- with 
the exception of farm and food products -- will be scrapped by 
January 1, 1998, three years ahead of schedule. 
  As for deregulation of trade in agricultural products, from 
July 1 duties on Hungarian exports to Poland will be cut by 50 
percent. The original agreement called for these duties to drop 
by 20 percent in two years, and by 50 percent in five years. 
  Hungary agreed with Czech and Slovak partners to lower 
duties 
on farm goods by 50 percent, instead of 20 percent, by January 
1, 1997. 
  The ministers said they expected trade liberalization 
between 
the four countries to improve European Union accession chances 
and offer better market access for a wide circle of regional 
exporters.

  [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- "My visit to the Czech 
Republic was very successful. Opportunities to intensify 
bilateral relations in different sectors are opening up," 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said on his return from 
Prague today. His talks there focused on economic issues and 
the two countries' adjustment to the new environment. 
  Mr. Daskalov said work was in progress on the agreements on 
the avoidance of double taxation and on investment promotion. 
Bulgaria and the Czech Republic expressed willingness to hold 
talks on setting up a free trade zone which would allow 
businessmen to step up two-way trade. "Our problems are 
identical: Both countries want to become integrated into 
Europe," Mr. Daskalov said. The Czech officials showed an 
interest in Bulgaria's position on the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia, he said. 
  "I had an interesting meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus. Being one of the greatest experts in reforms, he was 
interested in their progress in Bulgaria, as well as in the 
political situation," Mr. Daskalov said. On commission of 
President Zhelyu Zhelev, he handed over to Czech President 
Vaclav Havel archive records on the 1968 events and Bulgaria's 
participation in them. This act was highly praised. "By the 
way, Bulgaria is the last country to deliver these documents and 
Czech journalists asked me why we had not done so earlier," Mr. 
Daskalov said. 
  The agreement on visa-free entry clearance signed in Prague 
allows Bulgarians to spend up to a month in Prague and return 
home quite pleased, Mr. Daskalov said. 
  While in Prague, the Bulgarian foreign minister was also 
received by Chairman of the Czech parliament Milan Uhde.

  [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- Iraqi government special 
envoy Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari today met with Deputy Prime Minister 
Evgeni Matinchev, briefing him on Iraq's compliance with UN 
Security Council recommendations for the reparation of damage 
caused by the Gulf War. Mr. Anbari is here to prepare a session 
of the Bulgarian-Iraqi Committee on Trade and Economic 
Cooperation. 
  The visitor said Iraq was strictly compliant with UN 
requirements, yet the United Nations has not yet lifted the 
embargo inflicting irreparable damage on the Iraqi economy and 
people. He said the embargo has had an adverse impact on 
countries directly or indirectly linked to that war, including 
Bulgaria. Anbari said that after lifting the sanctions, Bulgaria 
and Iraq can resume cooperation in trade, construction and 
industry. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev recalled that as a result of 
the strict observance of the four-year long embargo, Iraq has 
run up a $3,250 million debt to Bulgaria.

  [Text] Prague, April 29 (CTK) -- Parliament today approved 
an amended law on political parties and movements which allows 
citizens over 18 years of age to become members of only one 
political party or movement. 
  Under the amendment political groupings are forbidden to run 
businesses. The dominant role in funding political parties and 
movements will be played by the state which will allocate 162 
million crowns (about $5.4 million) annually from its budget 
providing the Senate is not filled. If it is filled, state 
subsidies will be 40 million crowns (about $1.3 million) lower. 
In addition to this, parties and movements can acquire money 
through membership fees, from the lease of movable property and 
real estate, from loans, credits and gifts. 
  Reports on the financial management of political parties and 
movements, submitted to parliament and the Supreme Inspection 
Office annually by April 1, will include a list of gifts, their 
amounts and donors. If the value of a gift or the sum of the 
gifts' values from one donor exceeds 100,000 Czech crowns (about 
$3,333) a year then parties and movements must include basic 
personal data on the donor.

  [Text] Ostrava, North Bohemia, April 29 (CTK) -- The 
government coalition, with the help of some political parties, 
is starting to implement measures aimed at weakening the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), KSCM Chairman 
Miroslav Grebenicek told journalists today. He said he believed 
that the proposed amendment to the law on political parties was 
advantageous mainly for small and formerly non-existent parties. 
"Those who will support the amendment and thus demonstrate their 
accommodating approach will be richly rewarded," Grebenicek 
said. He added that at the same time these parties would make 
it clear that they place power and money above the obligations 
of the deputies of the legislative body which ensue from the law. 
  If the bill is passed and makes it possible to freely 
dissolve political parties then it would be a definitive full 
stop on the time in which citizens could cherish illusions about 
the existence of parliamentary democracy in the Czech Republic, 
he said. On the occasion of the 49th anniversary of the 
liberation of Ostrava from Nazi occupiers KSCM representatives 
today laid wreaths and bouquets of red carnations on the graves 
of fallen Red Army soldiers in the Comenius Park and at a 
memorial tank.

  [Excerpts] Prague, April 29 (CTK) -- Parliament today 
passed the bill submitted by Viktor Dobal (ODA) [Civic 
Democratic Alliance] amending the law on extra-judicial 
rehabilitations. The aim of the amendment is to enable property 
to be returned to Jewish individuals or their heirs. Debate 
surrounding the proposed return of property to the Jewish 
communities which was confiscated under the Nazi regime and 
post-war Czechoslovak communist governments has continued for 
almost four years now. 
  The restitution law passed by the Federal Assembly in 1991 
set 25 February 1948, the date of the communist take-over, as 
the limit before which claims cannot be made. The act was 
passed despite the appeals of the Federation of Jewish 
Communities (FZO), which protested the 1948 limit "would exclude 
from restitution almost all Jewish property which was 
confiscated after September 1938 and which in most cases has not 
been returned". [passage omitted] 
  A bill resolving many property claims of Jewish legal 
entities and individuals was drafted by ODA deputies around 
Viktor Dobal. The first part of the bill concerned 202 buildings 
and sites formerly belonging to the religious Jewish community. 
The list of property included 45 synagogues, 30 plots of land 
where synagogues stood before the occupation, 24 cemeteries, 12 
sites where cemeteries formerly were, ten religious schools and 
ritual baths. The second and third sections of the bill deal 
with the restitution of Jewish individuals, estimated at a few 
hundred. [passage omitted] 
  A further government bill, produced in April, allows for the 
redressing of property crimes committed between 1938 and 1945, 
but only if the properties now are in state ownership. While 
the government accepts in principle that it should pay 
compensation for property in private or community ownership that 
is restituted, it insists on limiting restitution to property 
that was the subject of an approved restitution claim before 25 
February 1948 and that has not already been returned to a 
claimant. 
  In his opening speech to the parliamentary debate, Dobal 
said the amendment had been drawn up in such a way as to 
preserve the restitution concepts already made part of Czech 
law, and to take into account the process of privatization 
currently taking place. 
  He emphasized that the amendment did not concern 
newly-founded restitution claims, did not even extend the amount 
of property or cases of property having been taken away, nor did 
it even extend the circle of persons with property claims. Its 
only aim was to define more precisely those persons, in order to 
remove the disharmony in court and clerical work in the judgment 
of the situations of persons to whom property should have been 
returned in accordance with post- war restitution laws. After 
the communist coup of 1948, however, the property which had been 
going to be returned to them was transferred to the state 
instead. 
  Dobal said that from the above point of view both the law on 
extra-judicial rehabilitations and the land law (his amendment 
to which is also being debated today) discriminated, de facto, 
against Jews, in the form in which they were passed by the 
former Czechoslovak Federal Assembly. 
  The amendment was part of a wider bill which Parliament 
failed to pass on February 18 because of the part concerning the 
problem of Jewish physical persons, Dobal said.

  [Text] Prague, April 29 (CTK) -- The parliament today 
approved a government proposal for foreign army units to be 
allowed to carry out short-term military exercises on Czech 
territory and for the Czech units to go abroad for similar 
exercises there. 
  The government is to inform the parliament about every 
exercise in advance and parliament is to give its prior approval 
each case foreign troops are to stay in this country. A maximum 
700 Czech troops may take part in the exercises abroad lasting 
up to 30 days, and up to 5,000 foreign troops may take part in 
exercises in the Czech Republic lasting up to 21 days, Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys said. 
  The proposal limits the foreign countries (as venues for 
exercises and participants in exercises held on the Czech 
territory) to those that the Czech Republic wants to integrate 
into, those participating in the Partnership for Peace project, 
and European neutral countries. 
  Joint exercises will involve Czech units, staffs, and 
commanding officers in the training of humanitarian, search and 
rescue, and peace operations, and allow Czech Air Force and 
ground-based anti-aircraft units to receive training of a kind 
unavailable in the Czech Republic but necessary to maintain 
their combat readiness.

  [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- About 1.8 billion korunas 
($62 million) gained through the sales of surplus and 
unnecessary Army property were transferred to the state budget 
in 1993, Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a press 
conference today. 
  He said he was pleased at the government's approval of the 
method of sales of Army buildings worth about 1 billion korunas 
($34,5 million). The Czech Army will get rid of this property 
either by transferring them free of charge to municipalities, in 
exchange for flats, or by selling them through real estate 
agencies, Baudys said. 
  The Army has been selling unnecessary buildings because it 
is 
impossible for it to continuously earmark soldiers for guarding 
them and money for their maintenance, Baudys explained.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) believes that Hungarian State Television -- 
contrary to its role as set down in the electoral law -- takes a 
biased and active role in the ongoing election campaign, and 
thus violates the electoral law. In a communique forwarded to 
MTI on Monday [2 May], the MSZP announced that it will lodge a 
complaint against Hungarian State Television to the National 
Election Committee. 
  According to the MSZP, Hungarian Television ensures 
publicity 
for unverified statements, unfounded accusations, and unmerited 
slander in some of its political programs. 
  The MSZP asks the National Election Committee to take a 
stand 
on the public service media carrying out independent political 
campaigning during the election campaign period. It also asks 
the Election Committee to call on the deputy chairman of 
Hungarian Television to immediately take the necessary steps to 
ensure the cleanness of the elections and the impartiality of 
the public service media he leads.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- The National Election 
Committee (NEC) held a session late Monday evening [2 May], and 
approved a position regarding the ongoing election campaign. 
According to the position, the Hungarian News Agency, Hungarian 
Radio and Hungarian Television cannot violate the fairness and 
impartiality of the parliamentary elections either in their 
election coverage, or in their election and other programmes. 
The position also calls on the public service media to strictly 
observe the campaign silence. 
  As was reported on Monday evening, President Arpad Goncz was 
the guest of the NEC session. NEC president Janos Nemeth 
informed members of the committee that the Hungarian President 
had indicated he would like to visit the session of the NEC at 
around 10 p.m. Sunday, May 8, after the first round of the 
elections. 
  The Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) had asked the NEC to 
take 
a stand regarding the April 29 programme of Hungarian 
Television's current political magazine programme, Panorama, 
which carried, according to the HSP, slanderous remarks against 
HSP Chairman Gyula Horn. The HSP believes Hungarian Television 
carries out a negative campaign against the Socialist Party. 
  The leader of Hungarian Television's legal department, Emil 
Tallos, who was present at the NEC session on Monday evening, 
said he does not believe the NEC's authority extends to the 
issue as Hungarian Television is not an election organ. 
  The representative of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), 
Istvan Jakab, pointed out that the committee could not take a 
stand in the concrete issue because "no evidence motion was 
submitted when the complaint was lodged". 
  HSP Deputy Chairman, Imre Szekeres, who represented the 
party 
at the session, withdrew his complaint in the matter at the NEC 
session. Later, he told journalists that the HSP would submit 
its evidence motion in the concrete issue on Tuesday. 
  Szekeres also said the party had asked independent experts 
to 
examine the impartiality of programmes on Hungarian Television, 
and this document will also be submitted to the National 
Election Committee on Tuesday, for it to form an opinion.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- As many as 7.8 million 
citizens will have the opportunity to vote on May 8, with half a 
million of them as first-time voters. 
  Hungary's electoral system incorporates both a simple 
majority system as used in Britain and France, and a 
proportionate system, applied in other European states. This 
combined method is completed by an admission threshold similar 
to Germany's. The 1989 Hungarian Election Act originally set 
forth four percent of the votes for each party as a minimum for 
gaining entrance into Parliament. In January 1994, this minimum 
was raised to five percent. 
  The electoral law has undergone minor changes since 1989. 
Keeping the principle of proportionate representation in view, 
the law aims at preventing mandates from being scattered among 
too many parties. To achieve this, a two-round electoral system 
was introduced, enabling the electorate to vote for individuals 
as well as for party lists. This year, the first round will be 
on May 8, and the second on May 29. 
  As in 1990, of 386 seats rivalled for, 176 will be filled by 
candidates in individual constituencies, whose lists were drawn 
up after April 9. (Each constituency consists of 60,000 
eligible voters.) 152 deputies will be elected on regional 
party lists and 58 on national party lists. 
  Under the Act, candidates can either be put up by parties 
and 
other political organizations, or enter the elections 
independently. To be qualified as a candidate, at least 750 
recommendations have to be collected beforehand. 
  This year, 130 parties wished to enter their candidates. In 
1990, twelve parties were able to draw up national lists and six 
reached the four percent threshold. 
  To win the first round and consequently a mandate, 
candidates 
have to poll over 50 percent of the votes. (In 1990, there were 
only five first-round winners.) If none of the candidates 
obtain an absolute majority, a run-off will follow with all 
candidates reaching 15 percent in the first round. Should fewer 
candidates poll the 15 percent minimum, the top three are 
eligible for the second round. As a result, losers of the first 
round still play a determining role, as they can encourage their 
supporters to back another candidate in the second leg. 
  Under the Election Act, campaigning must be suspended for 24 
hours preceding the election. 
  Voting is not an obligation but a right in Hungary as in 
most 
European states. Polls show that with the elections 
approaching, the number of citizens who are willing to vote and 
have considered their choice is growing. In 1990, the turnout 
was 63 percent in the first round of the general elections, and 
46 percent in the second. Analysts and polls forecast a 65-70 
percent participation rate for this year. 
  Under the act, besides fielding individual candidates, 
parties also draw up regional lists in 19 counties and Budapest. 
A party is qualified to put forward a regional list if it 
fields a candidate in at least 25 percent of individual 
constituencies of the given region. 152 seats are available 
through such lists. 
  To lose the minimum amount of total votes, 58 members of 
parliament are elected through national lists, which can be 
drawn up by parties having at least seven regional lists out of 
20. All the fractional votes are to be distributed among 
national-list candidates. 
  On April 11, the National Electoral Committee (OVB) drew 
lots 
for the 15 parties which have put up a national list for the May 
8 parliamentary elections. Accordingly, the order of the 
parties is as follows: Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' 
Party), Christian Democratic People's Party, Independent 
Smallholders' Party, National Democratic Alliance, Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, Hungarian Socialist Party, Workers' Party, 
Agrarian Association, Republic Party, Hungarian Life and Justice 
Party, Green Party of Hungary, Social Democratic Party of 
Hungary, Alliance of Free Democrats, Federation of Young 
Democrats, United Smallholders' Party. 
  This order will be of significance if two or more parties 
win 
an equal number of fractional votes in their national lists. In 
this case, the party which is placed further ahead wins the 
mandate. The OVB decided to grant 21,000 forints (HUF) to all 
4,164 individual and party-list candidates. Parliament 
earmarked HUF100 million for the purpose. Of this sum, the OVB 
laid aside more than HUF3 million on reserve. 
  The final results are expected only after the second round. 
As previously mentioned, of the 386 seats rivalled for, 176 
will be filled by individual candidates. 152 deputies will be 
elected on regional party lists and 58 on national party lists. 
  According to the National Electoral Committee, the parties 
have entered 1,903 individual candidates. The Hungarian 
Socialist Party has put up 176 candidates, the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats 175 each, 
the Federation of Young Democrats 174, the Christian Democratic 
People's Party 164, the Independent Smallholders' Party 157, the 
Workers' Party 156, the Agrarian Association 134, the Republic 
Party 84, the Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' Party) 69, 
the Hungarian Life and Justice Party 68, the National Democratic 
Alliance 59, the Social Democratic Party of Hungary 56, the 
United Smallholders' Party 54, the Green Party of Hungary 20, 
the Conservative Party 13, the Hungarian Market Party 8, the 
Compromise Smallholders' Party 7, the Family Alliance and the 
Green Alternative 5 each, the Democratic Coalition, the 
Solidarity Party of Gypsies and the Democratic Party 4 each, the 
Independent Hungarian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic 
Party 3 each, the Party of Hungarian Naturopaths and the 
Historical Smallholders' Party 2 each, the Party of the 
Hungarian Jobless, the National Party of Hungarian Mothers, the 
Pensioners' Party, the Movement of National Forces, the 
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Party for Historical 
Hungary, the Peace Party of Hungarian Gypsies, and the Party of 
Hungarian Interests 1 each. Independent candidates number 104.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- Voters are mainly 
concerned about issues related to the economy, and about the 
chances and avenues for economic growth, for the creation of 
welfare security. This was the almost unanimous statement made 
by the leaders of the six parliamentary parties' lists, who 
attended a forum on Monday evening in Budapest's University of 
Economics. 
  The forum was the closing event of a lecture series entitled 
"Elections 1994". The Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF) was 
represented by Prime Minister Peter Boross, the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (HSP) by Gyula Horn, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (AFD) by Gabor Kuncze, the Federation of Young 
Democrats (FYD) by Viktor Orban, the Christian Democratic 
People's Party (CDPP) by Laszlo Surjan, the Unified 
Smallholders' Party by Janos Szabo. 
  The central theme of the forum was the stake of the May 
parliamentary elections, the possible outcome, and the tasks 
facing the next government. Citing the experiences of their 
campaign tours, the views of the party list leaders were divided 
as regards the outcome of the elections. 
  Boross and Surjan were of the opinion that the voters do not 
want a radical political turn and change in direction. Although 
the two politicians acknowledged that many people presumably 
have still not decided who they would vote for, they stressed 
they believe the majority is for continuing on the road begun in 
the past four years, albeit with certain corrections. 
  As against this, Orban used the term "semi-turn", which is 
also formulated in the FYD's manifesto, to characterize the 
political direction desired for the future. He said people do 
not want to turn back the change in system, the process of 
changing the system, but they definitely want a change in 
government.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- Last year, the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF) and the Federation of Young Democrats 
(Fidesz) had the largest takings, HUF [Hungarian forints] 1.266 
billion and HUF939 million, respectively, according to the 45th 
issue of the official gazette MAGYAR KOZLONY, which published 
information on the 1993 balances of several parties. Most of 
the money for the MDF and the Fidesz came from selling 
self-owned real estate: The MDF drew HUF832 million this way, 
while there was HUF697 million for the Fidesz. 
  The total drawings of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) 
amounted to HUF429 million last year, of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) HUF300 million, and of the Christian 
Democratic People's Party (KDNP) HUF150 million. The MSZP's 
budget includes a HUF225 million item of income without any 
source mentioned. 
  A total of HUF296 million in state subsidies was granted 
last 
year to the MDF, 270 million to the SZDSZ, 170 million to the 
MSZP, and nearly HUF100 million to the KDNP. The MSZP took over 
HUF18 million in membership fees, while the MDF received HUF9 
million, the SZDSZ 5 million and the KDNP 4 million. FIDESZ 
members paid altogether HUF653,000 last year.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- Under Hungarian 
electoral law, April 29 is the last day for the press and the 
media to publish opinion poll results before the May 8 
elections. Therefore, several national dailies published the 
latest prognoses in today's issues. 
  The daily NEPSZABADSAG summarizes the analyses of four 
public 
opinion research firms -- Szonda-Ipsos, Median, Modus, and the 
Hungarian Gallup Institute -- concerning the first (May 8) round 
of the general elections. 
  According to the paper's summary, the number of Hungarian 
citizens planning to vote has increased recently: Two of the 
institutes expect a 70 percent turnout for the elections. All 
four surveys show that the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) 
retains first place in popularity so far. Three surveys place 
the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in second, followed by 
the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz) and the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF), vying for third with a equal number of 
points. The Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) and the 
Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) come next, with only 
a small difference in their popularity level. According to the 
polls, besides the above six, no other party is likely to reach 
the 5 percent limit -- the minimum for obtaining a mandate in 
Parliament. 
  The last research of the Hungarian Gallup Institute was 
carried out between April 22 and 24, taking a nationwide sample 
of the over-eighteen electorate. On the basis of the answers 
they received, participation in the elections will approach or 
might even reach 70 percent. 
  The analyses of the Gallup show only slight changes in the 
proportion of party adherents. According to the sample, general 
support for the MSZP has increased from 19 percent in March, to 
20 percent currently; for the SZDSZ it has increased from 9 to 
11; for the MDF, from 6 to 8; while for the Fidesz it has 
dropped from 10 to 9 percent. However, these results apply to 
the whole of the population, not only to those intending to cast 
their ballots. 
  According to Gallup: 31 percent of the citizens who will 
vote and have already decided for a party, wish to cast their 
ballots for the MSZP; 16 percent will vote for the SZDSZ; 13 
percent for the Fidesz; 12 percent for the MDF; 9 percent for 
the FKGP; and 7 percent for the KDNP.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- The National Police 
Headquarters (ORFK) will initiate keeping far-right Hungarist 
Movement leaders Albert Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos in custody 
pending trial on Saturday [30 April] at the latest. The two 
were arrested at dawn on Friday. 
  ORFK's Colonel Istvan Balatoni told reporters on Friday that 
14-15 flats were searched, fascist publications and 500 
swastika-emblems were confiscated, and 18-20 people were 
questioned during the dawn sweep carried out in cooperation with 
the Office for National Security. 
  According to Balatoni, the Hungarist Movement went public at 
its April 27 news conference in order to recruit sympathizers, 
because their founding document was signed only by 11 people, 
some of whom told the police that they knew nothing of Szalasi's 
ideology. (Ferenc Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led Hungary's fascist 
Arrow-Cross Party and Hungarist Movement. He was executed as a 
war-criminal in 1946.) 
  Balatoni stressed that charges of inciting ethnic hatred had 
only been lodged against Szabo and Gyorkos, while the police 
lacked sufficient evidence against the third Hungarist leader, 
Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem. Last year for a similar crime Gyorkos was 
sentenced to a year's imprisonment, suspended for three years. 
  The colonel denied any connection between the police action 
and the Hungarian Democratic Forum presidium's Thursday morning 
condemnation of the Hungarist Movement or Prime Minister Peter 
Boross's Thursday afternoon statement to the same effect. 
Balatoni said that preparing such a coordinated operation takes 
a longer time, and it has to be carried out at a time when the 
suspects are most probably at home.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 29 -- The newly appointed Deputy Prime 
Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko on Friday [29 
April] pledged that while coordinating the government economic 
policy he will take care that an authentic concern for the 
satisfaction of social needs of working people and businessmen 
be not ignored. Addressing the plenary meeting of the Sejm held 
amid a strike wave that has swept the country Kolodko said that 
under the present circumstances it is possible to reach 
consensus. 
  "I will not appeal for 90 peaceful days, I have no doubt 
that 
we need much more of peace than 90 days," Kolodko said. In his 
opinion, the foundations of an economic policy of the state must 
be constructed in the conditions of a will to reach agreement 
rather than solutions attained by force. "I do not see such 
conflicts of economic interests that, with a good will of all, 
could prevent us from solving problems," he said. Kolodko did 
not agree with the opinion that the coalition government has no 
economic programme. Instead, he confirmed the opinion that this 
programme must be critically assessed in a constructive and 
creative way. the government's strategy for poland, co-authored 
by Kolodko half a year ago, is designed to simulate development 
and growth. He expressed the hope that the government, in 
agreement with trade unions, will settle the wage control 
problem shortly. 
  In a statement for journalists Kolodko announced he will 
present to public opinion a medium-range programme of economic 
development for Poland, and submit it for discussion with trade 
unions and for approval of the government. A medium-range 
financial strategy that will combine instruments of monetary and 
fiscal policies will be an integral part of the programme. 
Kolodko named such priorities in the economic policy as 
stabilisation, economic growth and a just, or at least socially 
acceptable distribution of national income that would not give 
rise to conflicts. 
  Kolodko said he will meet with National Bank of Poland (NBP) 
President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz on Saturday. "I believe that 
our cooperation will go on perfectly well," he predicted. At 
the same time he said he will undertake steps to protect the 
zloty. Denomination of the zloty will have to be carried out 
along with the further fighting of inflation. The banks actions 
to this aim must be coordinated with those of the government. 
  "We have good economic prospects," Kolodko declared saying 
that everything indicates that real wages will increase sooner 
than planned. "I would treat it as my defeat and a failure of 
my mission if we fail to maintain Poland's good position as a 
leading country in central and Eastern Europe," he said. The 
most important thing is to change the situation in Poland for 
the better, the new deputy minister and finance minister 
declared.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 29 -- Polish and Russian transport 
ministers signed in Warsaw on Friday [29 April] a memorandum on 
the development of cooperation in transport between Poland and 
the Russian Federation. The memorandum envisages that the two 
countries will set up a joint committee to prepare a policy on 
road, air, sea transport as well as inland waters transport. 
According to Russian Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov, the 
lack of money does not allow for the realisation of transport 
investments such as the construction of highways and border 
crossings. The Russian minister said that Russia would decrease 
fees for flights over its territory which are higher than the 
prices of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation). 
Yefimov denied that Russian prices are higher.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Jozef Moravcik can see no reason to meet with his Czech 
counterpart Vaclav Klaus at the moment, government spokesman 
Lubomir Lintner told CTK today. He was reacting to a Friday [29 
April] statement by Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus that 
the two prime ministers should consider the abolition of the old 
bloc on the Slovak-Czech clearing account before it was 
discussed by the Slovak Government. 
  Lintner said that Moravcik was surprised by Filkus's 
statement, but added that "the times are hectic and a need for a 
meeting between the two premiers may arise as early as tomorrow." 
  Bratislava considers the abolition of the old bloc, which is 
used by enterprises in speculative payments to the detriment of 
Slovakia's balance of payments, the most urgent issue in 
relations with Prague. Under the old bloc, the 1-1 ratio is 
applied in payments related to trade agreements concluded before 
the currency split on February 8, 1993. The new bloc uses ECUs. 
  The Czech Government approved a proposal to abolish the old 
bloc as early as in mid-April, but the Slovak Government 
recently returned a similar draft for rewriting and it has not 
reappeared on the government's agenda to date.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 29 (CTK) -- The current government 
proceeds from the fact that the lustration law is valid and will 
seek to fulfill its obligations towards parties and movements 
which put their candidates for lustration through the Slovak 
Information Service (SIS), Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner 
said today. 
  He was answering the question of whether candidates proposed 
by political parties for early parliamentary elections, to be 
held in Slovakia at the end of September and the beginning of 
October, will be checked on whether they have collaborated with 
the former Czechoslovak secret police (StB). The 1991 
Czechoslovak lustration or screening law bars former communist 
party officials, StB agents, and People's Militia members from 
high political and economic posts until 1996. 
  The former government of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar did not 
ask that lustration certificates be produced because it 
evidently intended to abolish the lustration law. It had 
concluded an agreement with the Czech Republic under which the 
necessary documents should be returned to Slovakia gradually 
within 25 years, Pittner said. However, lustrations are not 
threatened since the new government had already agreed with the 
Czech authorities on the gradual return of the personal files of 
former StB collaborators. 
  However, the future of the lustration law in Slovakia would 
depend on the ruling of the Constitutional Court which was 
officially asked by Meciar's cabinet in January to investigate 
whether the lustration law does not contradict the Slovak 
Constitution. The former cabinet believed that the lustration 
law in "its full wording" runs contrary to the Slovak 
Constitution as it discriminates against some categories of 
people, does not respect the presumption of innocence and the 
need for cases to be judged by an independent court.

  [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- The new Slovak Government 
which will emerge from early parliamentary elections in the 
autumn will not be formed without the left coalition, Petr 
Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), said in an 
exclusive interview with CTK on Sunday [1 May]. "The left has 
won in Poland, socialists in Hungary have excellent prospects 
and it will apparently not be possible to rule without a 
social-democratic bloc also in Slovakia," Weiss added. 
  Leftist tendencies in Central Europe have one indisputably 
positive characteristic -- these parties are not nationalistic 
and are capable of coming to an agreement and cooperate and thus 
turn Central Europe into a region of stability and not of 
potential conflict, Weiss said. 
  He admitted, however, that the prospects of the Slovak left 
would also depend on the success of the current Slovak 
Government of Jozef Moravcik. The new government will have 
first of all to convince people that a businessperson has a 
chance in this country and that it can be ruled without 
conflicts and looking for an enemy, he said. 
  Weiss admitted that SDL's participation in ousting 
ex-premier 
Vladimir Meciar and mainly that party's coalition with the 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), its political antipole, had 
caused some left supporters to ask questions, although, for 
example in Austria, such a coalition has been functioning 
successfully for a long time, he said. 
  However, people have already come to realise that it is 
necessary and in the interest of the common good, to come to an 
agreement also with a partner with whom we thought it impossible 
to come to terms several months ago, said Weiss, referring to 
the SDL's union with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). 
"Either both sides would again and again return to reproaching 
each other or we would adopt a different philosophy. We should 
not hate each other because we uphold different political values 
and have different political programmes, competing for voters' 
support," said Weiss, adding that he did not rule out that the 
current coalition (of the SDL, the KDH and the Centrist Bloc 
made up of politicians who separated from the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS] would continue also after the autumn 
elections. 
  "However, we exclude the possibility of union with 
politicians who base their policies on confrontation and harm 
Slovakia's good image abroad and thus prevent foreign capital 
from entering Slovakia. It is impossible to cooperate with 
politicians who are not willing to observe a long-term 
compromise with their political partners but who seek to impose 
their will on them from a position of strength," Weiss said when 
asked about the possibility of a coalition with Meciar.

  [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- Central Europe has long 
been burdened by the state of Slovak-Hungarian relations which 
are even perceived as an obstacle on its road towards the 
European Union and NATO, Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman 
Peter Weiss told CTK on Sunday. 
  Relations between Bratislava and Budapest have been 
characterised thus far by Slovakia's apprehensions concerning 
the unwillingness of Budapest to endorse the current 
Slovak-Hungarian borders officially in the as yet non-existent 
treaty between the two countries. Hungary's complaints about the 
position of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia, a dispute 
over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the Danube and minor 
controversies over the unwillingness of Hungary to conclude a 
readmission agreement or open new border crossings are among 
other disputed issues, Weiss said. 
  "However, the problems between Hungary and Slovakia are not 
as dramatic as they are sometimes made out to be. We do not see 
the situation as a conflict," Weiss said. He accused the former 
Slovak Government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar and the current 
Hungarian cabinet of attempting to win points in the internal 
political scene "by excessively dramatising Hungarian-Slovak 
problems and putting the blame on each other." 
  "If the French and the Germans have managed to reconcile, 
then Hungarians and Slovaks can also come to terms," he said. 
Weiss pointed to the fact that the SDL and the Hungarian 
Socialist Party of Gyula Horn, a favourite of the forthcoming 
Hungarian elections, are ready to conclude a basic inter-state 
treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of the common border and 
rights to ethnic minorities in both countries. 
  Weiss stressed, however, that his will to historic 
reconciliation with Budapest has its limits -- all speculations 
about territorial autonomy for the Hungarian ethnic minority in 
Slovakia are unacceptable to us since they simply will not pass 
in Slovakia. 
  Regarding Slovakia's relations with the Czech Republic, 
Weiss 
said they required primarily a matter-of-fact approach. Weiss, 
who is considered a possible candidate for Slovak future 
premier, further said: 
  "We consider relations with the Czech Republic to be of a 
key 
importance. We want to proceed from all the positive steps 
achieved during the 74 years of our co-existence. Naturally the 
two countries are currently independent and have their own 
interests which they want to protect. But these interests 
should be pursued and protected on the basis of an expert and a 
matter-of-fact dialogue."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- In an interview with CTK 
today, Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter Weiss 
avoided answering directly the question concerning the screening 
of SDL ministers. "The screening requires a certain procedure. 
We suppose that President (Michal Kovac) had checked the 
question before appointing new government members," Weiss said. 
  The screening law, passed by the Czechoslovak Parliament in 
1991, bars people linked to the former communist-run StB secret 
police, high Communist Party officials and members of the 
People's Militia from high government and economic posts until 
1996. The screening procedure is carried out by the Interior 
Ministry which issues certificates on whether or not a person 
was among those listed by the law. 
  According to the legislative department of the Presidential 
Office, the president is legally bound to have all govenrment 
nominees screened. This was also done in the case of the 
government of Jozef Moravcik, but it is not president's duty to 
announce the result, department officials told CTK. In 
connection with emerging speculations about "possible problems 
of one of the cabinet members with the screening law," Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed in today's issue of the daily 
NARODNA OBRODA that in line with the law he had asked for the 
screening of all members of his government. 
  A representative of Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia 
(DEUS) assured CTK today that none of the ministers who are DEUS 
members had problems with the screening law. "Not a single DEUS 
candidate for a ministerial post was screened positively," DEUS 
spokeswoman Gabriela Nemkyova said. 
  Weiss also told CTK that "there was no connection between 
the 
SDL's unwillingness to support the original proposal to appoint 
Roman Kovac Slovak Prime Minister and the proposal for his 
dismissal sumbitted to the parliament last week by Deputy Dusan 
Masiar from the (opposition) Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS)." 
  (Considering the suitable candidate for the post of prime 
minister in mid-March), "we thought that the prime minister 
should be an internationally known and accepted politician. We 
reached the conclusion that Jozef Moravcik would be capable of 
better integrating the heterogenous coalition," Weiss said. At 
a press conference today, Weiss announced that at the next 
meeting of the coalition council he wanted to take up again the 
question of breaching the coalition agreement by DEUS. 
  In April, Moravcik was elected DEUS chairman. Under the 
agreement he cannot be simultaneously party chairman and prime 
minister. "In view of the forthcoming election campaign, DEUS 
has been put into advantage," Weiss stressed, adding he had 
twice discussed the issue with Moravcik by phone. 
  The elections are to be held on September 30-October 1.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Miklos Duray, chairman 
of the Egyutteles (Coexistence) Hungarian minority movement in 
Slovakia, said today that the current cabinet of Jozef Moravcik 
had been charged by parliament with joining the European Charter 
of Regional and Minority Languages. He said that a failure to 
meet this condition might influence Egyutteles' support for the 
government coalition. 
  "I know nothing about the proposal to sign the European 
Charter of Minority Languages having been withdrawn," Duray told 
CTK, adding that while discussing the government program the 
parliament charged the government with joining the charter. 
This had been demanded by Egyutteles for at least two years, 
already during the former Czechoslovakia, he said. 
  The Slovak Government press department today told CTK that 
the proposal for the signing of the charter had been withdrawn 
from the agenda of today's cabinet meeting. 
  However, the government today approved a parliamentary 
proposal on population registers. The passing of this proposal 
was one of further demands by Hungarian minority leaders as it 
was to include the use of Hungarian first names and Hungarian 
women's names without the Slovak ending -ova. Meeting this 
demand was also one of the conditions which Slovakia committed 
itself to fulfilling when it was accepted to the Council of 
Europe.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The editorial staff of 
the Bratislava evening paper VECERNIK are apologizing to 
ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and the former director of his 
secretariat, Anna Nagyova, for publishing on April 26 an article 
headlined "Will Vladko Be Rocking the Cradle?", the daily 
REPUBLIKA writes today. 
  Last week VECERNIK wrote that "the love, kept secret for 
several years, between Vladko (diminutive for Vladimir) and his 
right hand Anicka (diminutive for Anna) who until very recently 
were calling the shots in the political heavens is to bear 
well-deserved fruit for the benefit of our country in five or 
six months." 
  "It is true that we have published something in small 
italics, written in a considerably ironical manner, and 
headlined Will Vladko Be Rocking the Cradle?, on April 26, 
without mentioning specific," but making it possible to guess 
that it concerned the above mentioned figures, VECERNIK 
confessed. 
  The paper called on the Austrian Press Agency APA to publish 
a denial of its report, in which it cited the full names of 
former Slovak ex-Prime Minister and director of his secretariat, 
referring to the VECERNIK story. A spokesman of Meciar's 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said that "Austria was 
interfering with the election campaign in Slovakia in the 
dirtiest possible way."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- To expect civic 
reconciliation now after different political groupings joined 
together against the winner of the 1992 parliamentary elections 
and seized power in a parliamentary way would be either 
political naivete or deliberate demagoguery, the daily 
REPUBLIKA, close to ex- premier Vladimir Meciar, writes today 
referring to the situation in Slovakia after the change of 
cabinet. 
  "Meciar, as a non-corrupted and a pro-Slovak orientated 
politician, has strong voter support in Slovakia, in spite of 
all the attacks on him. But it is not only because of Meciar's 
charisma that even people whom the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) has not addressed until recently and who 
preferred business to politics, are currently turning towards 
Meciar's banner," the paper says. 
  The government coalition's attacks on the HZDS have a deeper 
meaning than it may outwardly seem. "It is not only more than 
200 billion crowns of property to be privatized which is in 
question, although it is just this which caused the majority of 
regional party leaders to miraculously change their positions, 
but rather the internal development of the country and the 
question of which international circles will include Slovakia in 
their sphere of influence, REPUBLIKA writes. 
  "The internal political situation in Slovakia is 
characterized by controversies. Instead of building serious 
international prestige and advantageous economic ties which 
would lead Slovakia to prosperity, it is acquiring the stigma of 
an unstable country. Foreign investors and partners have no 
guarantee that they are not investing in a country where the 
political situation and economic projects change with the 
weather," the daily writes. 
  The new government coalition had pledged to pursue civilized 
policies without confrontational tones while accusing the HZDS 
of doing that. "But the developments we have been witnessing 
recently show how distant are the bosses of political parties 
and movements from political culture, they lack the political 
maturity which [is] reflected in a gentleman-like approach 
towards adversaries. Attacks on the ex-premier did not calm down 
even after the victorious assault of his post by temporary 
allies. On the contrary, they are growing stronger, the daily 
writes. 
  Meciar took time out immediately after the shocking fall of 
his cabinet, the independent NARODNA OBRODA writes. Two years 
after a decisive election victory the HZDS has weakened to such 
an extent that a direct hit from the Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
and the opposition put it out of parliament for six months. 
However, the HZDS, the strongest political force in Slovakia 
according to poll ratings, has recovered quickly from the 
knock-out. The ex-premier's tactics of silence and avoiding 
journalists has become its program and the HZDS has sent to the 
advance front positions its "reserve snipers" such as Olga 
Keltosova, Sergej Kozlik, Tibor Cabaj, and Katarina Tothova. 
  "This phenomenon might have at least two explanations. 
Either a fight for confidence and the nomination to the 
candidate slates is being waged within the movement or it is 
hiding its biggest trumps -- election leaders Meciar and Ivan 
Gasparovic -- to use them for the last pre-election moves," 
NARODNA OBRODA writes. 
  The daily stresses, however, that the shift of sympathies 
during the current election campaign in Hungary does not play 
into the HZDS's cards since if Hungarian Socialists of Gyula 
Horn in coalition with the Free Democrats win the elections then 
Meciar's Hungarian card will be set at naught. 
  "And finally, a protective mist over Meciar is aimed to 
convince voters that he has never been and is not a source of 
political confrontation. And with the loss of memory it would 
be easy to believe that it was the Castle (Slovak president's 
residence) and all those who betrayed the HZDS and the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) who caused the confrontation. The sharpest 
attacks will not therefore be directed towards the strongest 
political enemies -- the Christian Democrats and the SDL -- but 
against Meciar's former co- workers such as Roman Kovac, Jozef 
Moravcik, Rudolf Filkus, Ludovit Cernak, and President Michal 
Kovac, the daily writes.

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Dorotkova: "The Babicka Factor"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--When the crowd, consisting as usual 
almost wholly of retired adorers of Vladimir Meciar, shouts 
angrily for civil war, or throws eggs and yells "Fuj!" at 
Hungarian politicians, or waves pictures of World War II Slovak 
clerico-fascist leader Josef Tiso, most young people just walk 
by and laugh. 
  "They will die out," said Roman Hric, a 24-year-old 
mathematician, with a shrug. 
  With their green hair, their angry, slack eyes and their 
inability to maintain a threat of logic through their ranted 
monologues, the cartoon-like protesters who take to the streets 
to support Meciar's political fortunes are easy objects of 
ridicule. 
  "Many of the people who have been demonstrating on squares 
and calling for my resignation are not sufficiently aware of the 
country's political situation," President Kovac told a March 14 
news conference. "Perhaps among them there are some who will 
never be aware of it, and they will always stand behind Mr. 
Meciar." 
  But while their numbers rarely push over 300, the "Geriatric 
Ward," as they are commonly referred to, strike a chord of dread 
in many Slovaks--and not just in Stefan Hrib. 
  Hrib, a longtime critic of the recently ousted premier, is a 
Radio Free Europe journalist who was attacked by an anti-Kovac 
mob in mid-March, suffering "injuries to his head, neck and 
chest and bloody welts on his back consistent with being beaten 
by a large number of people," according to his doctor. 
  Much more frightening for young Slovaks and journalists than 
the chances of the odd physical attack, though, is the danger 
that these people, and the generation they represent, will 
return Meciar to power for a third time. 
  Popular political commentator and humorist Robert Kotian of 
the daily SME said the Sept. 30-Oct. 1 election results would be 
positive "only if the voters were under 40." 
  Meciar's return to power would be the last straw for many of 
Slovakia's best and brightest. "[It] would be a big trauma for 
those who want Slovakia to be a democratic country," said 
Frantisek Miklosko, vice chair of the Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH). 
  "If he wins the elections in September, I'm packing my 
bags," 
said Michal Balan, a 25-year-old scientist. 
  For Balan, this is no idle worry. The latest poll released 
by 
the Slovak Statistics Office, taken in March, showed that 
despite an ever-growing dossier of corruption allegations, the 
most trusted politician in Slovakia is...Vladimir Meciar. The 
man who, in the immortal words of ex-Foreign Minister Milan 
Knazko, "uses lies as a working method," was trusted by 25 
percent of 1,237 respondents--more than any other politician. 
  One Bratislava taxi driver said he couldn't figure out where 
the Statistics Office found so many Meciar supporters. 
"Everybody I give a ride to hates the man," he said, adding that 
it was the same for other taxi drivers. "No way is he ever going 
to go win the elections again." 
  Think again, said 65-year-old Augustin Marian Huska, a top 
leader of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
"We will win no matter what. And all those who think we won't 
would do better to forget about that," he said. "Each time they 
throw us to our knees, we become stronger." 
  This is exactly what worries Meciar's opponents. The last 
time he was removed as premier, in March 1991, Bratislava was 
rocked by protests of up to 50,000 people. With Slovaks 
increasingly uncomfortable in the Czechoslovak federation, 
Meciar seized the nationalist banner, accusing those who ousted 
him of being "federalists," or "mafia." Much of the media warmed 
to Meciar's stirring calls of "Slovaks to your feet!" and the 
bumbling nature of the lame-duck government helped bring Meciar, 
the wronged under-dog, the prize he had lost so shamefully just 
15 months earlier. 
  Then, as now, Meciar's rough charm, his street-wise 
political 
diction and his avuncular charisma made him a huge hit with the 
elderly, especially in rural areas. Intellectual parties were 
unable to reach these voters, and they were trounced. HZDS won 
37 percent of the vote in the June 1992 elections, while the 
heroes of the 1989 revolution, the Public Against Violence 
movement, didn't even make it into Parliament. 
  For the older generation, many of whom remember Czech 
arrogance prior to World War II and the glories of Slovak 
nationalism during Tiso's Nazi-sponsored republic, the triumph 
represented good over evil, destiny over history, Slovaks over 
their oppressors and--worse yet--traitors. The younger 
generation largely saw the vote as the defeat of decency and 
intelligence by crude nationalism and opportunism. 
  The gap between them hasn't narrowed since. Only 12 percent 
of voters aged 18 to 25 support Meciar, while he draws more than 
30 percent of those over 60, who make up 21 percent of 
Slovakia's electorate, the Slovak Statistics Office reported. 
  Tomas Pitonak, a 22-year-old university student, said he 
convinced his grandmother not to vote for Meciar last time. 
"Look, Granny," he said he told her. "You're going to die soon. 
But I'm going to be living in this country for the next 40 
years." 
  But the animosity can get a lot nastier than that. The 
Geriatric Ward is fed daily with the high-charged attacks of the 
pro-Meciar nationalist daily REPUBLIKA and its editors, who says 
Meciar was ousted by a "Czechoslovakist, Communist and Hungarian 
conspiracy" in ways that recall Czechoslovakia's February 1948 
Communist coup. 
  Editor Jan Smolec and his REPUBLIKA argue in apocalyptic 
tones, using violent images and frequently invoking destiny. 
"The hope that the young Slovakia would be accepted also by 
those who originally did not want it has been trampled in the 
dust," Smolec wrote March 19. "Communists, Czechoslovakists and 
Hungarian irredentists will end up in the dustbin of history, 
but Slovakia and Slovaks will remain." 
  Such tones have Jozef Moravcik worried. At his government's 
first press conference, the new premier said one of his main 
tasks would be to lessen "the incomprehensible and dangerous 
hostility between various groups of citizens." 
  With election campaigns in both Hungary and Slovakia this 
year, many in Slovakia and in the international community are 
worried that the rhetoric could topple things into real 
conflict. Not Knazko. "I think that as [Meciar] gets more 
radical, the number of his supporters becomes smaller," he told 
the Czech daily EXPRES March 17. 
  Peter Weiss, chair of the strongest party in the new 
governing coalition, the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), 
said this time around things would be different because "people 
now have some experience from two years of HZDS rule, including 
great dissatisfaction with its economic policy," he told the 
Czech daily PRACE March 14. 
  But with elections six months away, supporters and 
detractors 
alike are asking the same question: What's Meciar going to do 
this time? 
  "He managed to turn his defeat into a victory once already," 
wrote the Germany daily DIE PRESSE March 11. "The very criticism 
from politicians in Bratislava and from abroad could bring him 
people's sympathy. The Slovak problem does not lie merely in 
Meciar's psychology, but in the psychology of his voters."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- The economy ministers 
consider that the gradual reconstruction of the V-1 unit of the 
nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice, west Slovakia, can be 
carried out so that it will not close until after the year 2002, 
announced Economy Minister Peter Magvasi. "The decision comes 
from the recommendation of the International Agency for Atomic 
Energy (MAAE) [IAEA], which rates highly the technical state of 
the V-1 reactor in Bohunice. The agency recommended such action 
as would allow for V-1 to operate until the year 2002," he said, 
adding however that the cabinet had yet to decide the issue. 
Earlier it was said that if not reconstructed, the plant would 
have to close down in 1995. A Franco-German consortium and the 
EBRD are making the provision of a 1.3-billion mark loan for the 
uncompleted nuclear energy plant at Mochovce, west Slovakia, 
conditional on the closure of the V-1 plant.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- A Czech-Slovak agreement 
on military cooperation was signed today by the two countries' 
defense ministers, Antonin Baudys and Pavol Kanis. "The 
document concerns all fields of armed forces activity and is 
more detailed than similar agreements with other neighbors," 
Baudys told journalists after the ceremony. "Relations between 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia will always be of more 
importance than with other countries," he said. 
  Kanis voiced the conviction that in the two countries' armed 
forces there were only few supporters of the idea that the 
common Czech-Slovak border should become also a geo-political 
border. "Our countries are heading for European security 
structures and in this our interests are similar," Baudys said. 
  Both ministers expressed the determination to settle as soon 
as possible "open" questions in the division of the former 
Czechoslovakia's federal property. "There still exist some 
unsolved property claims which are being decided gradually," 
Baudys told CTK. He added, however, that he could not say when 
these problems would be solved, especially the problem of the 
division of the archives of intelligence services. 
  Baudys described his meeting with Kanis as important not 
only 
because the agreement was signed but also because talks on 
European security, the Partnership for Peace initiative and 
other questions concerning Czech-Slovak cooperation were 
discussed. 
  Simultaneously with talks between Baudys and Kanis 
discussions of the two countries' army representatives were 
held. Baudys will end his visit to Slovakia today.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The most important fact 
about the meeting between Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik and 
Hungarian Premier Peter Boross on Sunday [1 May] was that it 
took place, although the limited maneuvering space excluded 
beforehand a drastic change at least in one of the accumulated 
problems, SME writes. 
  "The inventory fully exposed the two countries' different 
views on the problems complicating mutual relations. 
Differences in opinion are already appearing in their approach 
towards a fundamental agreement which, according to Bratislava, 
would guarantee the inviolability of the border defined by the 
1920 Treaty of Trianon," the paper says. It notes that Moravcik 
believes that the rapid conclusion of a fundamental treaty 
between the two countries with a clause on the border would help 
resolve other issues. However, Boross favors the opposite 
approach; the gradual elimination of problems, starting with 
minor ones and ending up with the most serious ones, which would 
result in the signing of the basic document. 
  SME says that both approaches are logical and that Hungary's 
attitude need not necessarily be malicious, but only a different 
viewing of priorities. Slovakia considers the issue of its 
territorial integrity of primary importance, whilst Hungary 
considers the minority issue of key importance. "The two issues, 
of course, are closely linked but unfortunately they have 
blocked each other so far," the paper writes. 
  "The Komarno inventory showed that the mutual trust deficit 
is not so high.... The fact that a week before parliamentary 
elections the Hungarian Premier considered it necessary to catch 
up with Hungarian opposition leaders as regards contacts with 
Slovakia is a signal that the Hungarian voter wants relations 
with his neighbor to improve. This can be considered a basis 
(for development of bilateral relation) irrespective of who wins 
the elections in Hungary," the paper says in conclusion.

  [Text] Tirana, April 29 (ATA) -- The Serbian Supreme Court 
will start a trial against 8 Albanians accused of "violation of 
territorial integrity" of the former Yugoslavia. The first 
trial of this political process was conducted in October 1992. 
It passed punishments ranging from 2.6 years of imprisonment 
although there were no proofs for the Albanian defendants. Such 
farces, which are now so common, are being organized in order to 
justify the state Serbian terror against the Albanians.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] According to Arkan 
[commander of the Serbian Volunteer Guard], there is no room in 
Kosova either for those who deserted the Yugoslav Army. Arkan 
hailed "The construction of the refugee camps on the border 
between Albania and Kosova," adding that his party will soon 
start an initiative related to the restitution of 7,300 hectares 
of fertile land which according to Arkan is in the hands of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  Some days ago, the BUJKU newspaper wrote that paramilitary 
troops of Arkan and his spokesman Borsiwav Televic [name as 
received] stayed in Dragash in the border zone with Albania 
where they provoked some citizens. 
  A report from the Information Centre of Kosova said that 
Serbian military forces and paramilitary troops have been 
concentrated on the border zone of Kosova with Albania. 
  A report of the Information Centre of the Democratic League 
[of Kosova -- LDK] branch in Gjakova on April 30 said that tanks 
of the Serbian Army directed to Albania and Gjakova have been 
planted in the vicinity of the border with Albania, in the 
village Zhup of Gjakova.

  UK CHAIN TO SELL BULGARIAN WINE: Sainsbury, the largest 
British retail cooperative, will sell Bulgarian wine, STANDART 
NEWS reported on 25 March, citing information from Vinprom in 
Lyaskovets. The bottling of the first batch of 300,000 bottles 
of white wine produced under a new Australian technology started 
there yesterday. This is the first Bulgarian company to 
introduce a leading technology in wine production commissioned 
by the British Premium Brand Corporation. (Sofia BTA in English

  GOLD DISCOVERED: Exploratory drilling near the village of 
Zidarovo in eastern Bulgaria has shown the presence of enormous 
deposits of ore containing 2-3 grams of gold per tonne. The 
samples also show the presence of 0.25-0.30 g of copper and of 
silver. Engineer Atanas Pavlov, manager of Burgas Copper Mines, 
believes that 400,000-500,000 tonnes of the deposits will 
probably turn out to be suitable for industrial processing. The 
team he heads has already drafted a program for the 
comprehensive prospecting of the region, on which the Ministry 
of Industry will have to decide within two weeks. (Sofia BTA in

  EMPLOYEES BUY STATE COMPANY: The Stil state-owned enterprise 
in Dimitrovgrad (southern Bulgaria) was privatized in an 
unprecedented way: It is now owned by its employees, who hold 
58 percent of the capital, and will be run by a managers' team 
that owns the remaining 42 percent. Radka Ruseva, chairman of 
the Board of Directors, and Reneta Indzhova, managing director 
of the Privatization Agency, made this announcement at a news 
conference on 31 March. Stil Ltd. has signed a contract with 
the Hunter Douglas company from the Netherlands for the

  VAT INTRODUCED, ENERGY PRICES RISE: On 1 April, value-added 
tax comes into force in Bulgaria. In addition to this, as of 1 
April new prices are introduced for electric power, thermal 
power, coal, and fuel briquettes. Domestic consumers will now 
have to pay 29 percent more for electricity, paying 80 stotinki 
per kilowatt-hour under the day tariff and 40 stotinki under the 
night tariff. Until now, people have been paying 60 stotinki 
per kilowatt-hour during the day and 35 stotinki for nighttime 
consumption. Domestic steam and hot water central heating 
supplies will rise in price by 89 percent. Each gigacalorie 
will cost 450 leva, as compared with 238 leva until now. 
Citizens will have to pay their bills in the form of two 
different charges. A consumer energy tax will be imposed only 
during the cold season, calculated on the basis of social 
consumption of heat at the rate of 315 leva per gigacalorie. 
During both winter and summer, subscribers will pay a basic 
monthly charge for central heating of 90 stotinki per cubic 
meter of living space. This charge is introduced in Bulgaria 
for the first time. (Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian

Cultural Center in Burgas, said. In the seventies Bulgaria had 
220,000 hectares of vineyards, but their area is now 120,000 
hectares. Grape sales are have fallen four-fold, while wine 
exports have declined to 50 million bottles per year from 360

  FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS: Forex deposits in Bulgaria rose 
by 8.5 billion leva to 87.5 billion leva last week, 24 CHASA 
reported on 4 April, quoting the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB). 
The bulk of the deposits are held by state-run companies (48.8 
billion leva), followed by personal deposits (27.9 billion leva) 
and deposits by private firms (10.8 billion leva). However, 
recent foreign currency purchases were not made with leva drawn 
from bank accounts. Last week time deposits fell by 0.7 billion 
leva to 124.6 billion, while call and savings deposits rose 
respectively by 0.4 billion leva to 18.900 billion leva, and by 
0.5 billion leva to 29.6 billion. At the start of this year 
forex deposits stood at 51.2 billion leva, climbing by over 70 
percent in three months. Since early 1994 the dollar has gained 
75 percent against the Bulgarian lev. Last week the prices of 
staple commodities traded on the commodity market rose by 30 
percent on average, TRUD and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK reported. The 
reasons are the soaring rate of exchange between the dollar and 
the lev and the levy of the new value-added tax. For the time 
being, the BNB does not intend to commit itself to a daily fixed 
exchange rate of the Russian ruble against the Bulgarian lev, as 
both currencies are heavily affected by inflation, STANDART NEWS 
reported BNB officials as saying. Settlements between the two 
countries will be effected in their national currencies under an 
agreement recently signed in Moscow. (Sofia BTA in English 0920

  ILLEGAL GRAIN EXPORTS CAUSE LOSSES: The treasury lost about 
7.2 million leva in duties as a result of illegal grain exports 
in 1992, the parliamentary commission of inquiry into grain 
exports in 1992 reported to parliament on 7 April. Grain 
exports were banned from 1 January to 1 July 1992, except if 
compensated by the import of cereal products. During this 
period 50 companies exported 278,327 tonnes of grain, but only 
three firms imported processed cereal products, the commission's 
chairman Petur Markov reported. Markov said that the commission 
considers the former cabinets of Dimitur Popov and Filip 
Dimitrov failed to properly monitor the ban on grain exports.

  DEBT 120 BILLION LEVA: "Bulgaria's internal debt is 
estimated 
at about 120 billion leva," Plamen Oresharski, head of the 
Finance Ministry's Treasury and Debt Department, reported in the 
Banker weekly. According to Oresharski, this figure includes 
budget deficit financing over the last three years, the debts of 
enterprises transformed into public debts and the financing of 
agriculture. "The foreign-exchange debts of state- controlled 
companies, amounting to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars, are yet to be 
transformed into a public debt," Oresharski says. When added to 
the internal debt, the latter would exceed 200 billion leva.

  DOLLARS FOR TRAVEL: The 24 CHASA daily reported on 13 April 
that the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) has allocated 
U.S.$400,000 for purchase by Bulgarians wishing to travel 
abroad. The 7M Company, which runs a network of currency 
exchange offices in Sofia, is acting as an agent for the 
operation. Private persons -- tourists or persons going abroad 
on business -- can buy a maximum of U.S.$2,000 at a fixed rate 
of 55.02 leva per dollar, which is three to five leva cheaper 
than the quotations of the other exchange offices in Sofia. An 
expert cited by 24 CHASA considers that the BNB is using an 
unconventional methods to bring down exchange rates. Meanwhile, 
the dollar exchange rate in the interbank market fell by about 
two leva. Dealers say the market is under control and predict 
the dollar will become still cheaper. (Sofia BTA in English 1101

  BRAIN DRAIN CONTINUES: "Brain Drain May Turn Bulgaria Into 
Banana Republic," reads the headline of a front-page article in 
KESH ("Cash"), a business weekly. According to the paper, 
intellectuals make up 26.3 percent of Bulgarians who have left 
the country since 1991. Referring to statistics issued by the 
Institute of Sociology with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 
the weekly claims that 40 percent of Bulgarian scientific 
workers would take any other job if offered better pay. (Sofia

  JOINT COMPANY FORMED: In all likelihood, Sofia will have 
three new gasoline stations by the end of the year because Sofia 
Municipal City Council and Shell-Bulgaria Limited have formed a 
joint company to build them. The city council will not have to 
invest any cash in the project, but will give Shell the right to 
build the filling stations on municipal land. (Sofia KONTINENT

  BULGARIAN-RUSSIAN BANK: Approximately 30 large Russian 
banks, 
state companies, and private financial groups have declared 
their readiness to acquire shares in the new Bulgarian-Russian 
Investment Bank. On the Bulgarian side, some 15 banks and state 
firms will be participating. The firms in question are totally 
concentrating their export activities on the Russian market. 
Bulgarian bankers have held meetings with Russian Parliament 
deputies and representatives of the Russian National Bank, large 
commercial banks, and groups of private investors in Russia. 
Talks have been held on establishing direct ferry links and 
developing projects in the nuclear and gas industries. One of 
the primary tasks of the new bank, which will have its 
headquarters in Sofia, will be to guarantee and develop an 
economic policy for our participation in Russian markets. 
However, its main functions will be to invest in traditional 
production enterprises primarily engaged in export so as to 
recover the lost positions in the Russian market. Bulgaria's 
annual trade turnover with Russia has declined from 13 billion 
leva four years ago to 1.2 billion leva. The bank will have an 
initial capital of 400 million leva. (Sofia KONTINENT in 
Bulgarian 11 Apr 94 p 7) 
  MINIMUM IMPORT PRICES: On April 14, the government set 
minimum import prices for steel pipes, electric lamps, and 
rubber tires. Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev, the sponsor 
of the scheme, said the licensing rules and minimum prices were 
intended to protect Bulgarian producers. The cabinet set the 
following minimum import prices: $2.5 a kilo for rubber tires, 
$0.15 apiece for filament lamps, $0.60 apiece for fluorescent 
lamps, $3 apiece for mercury-vapor lamps, and $400-450 a ton for 
steel pipes. Last year, a sharp rise in imports of these goods 
affected the domestic market, Karabashev said. These 
developments and the loss of traditional markets for Bulgarian 
exports harmed local producers, who have been demanding 
protectionist measures. The Ministry of Trade in 1993 raised 
customs duties to the maximum possible within the effective 
customs duty schedule, but the measure proved insufficient. The 
restrictions will apply for a year and may be lifted in six 
months if they prove successful. (Sofia BTA in English 1115 GMT

  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT COMPLETED: The Bulgarian company 
Glavbulgarstroy opened a housing development with 700 flats in 
the region of Zhitomir, Ukraine. This is the second housing 
development in Ukraine that Glavbulgarstroy has built in 
partnership with the German company Hochtief under the program 
for the construction of dwellings for the military returning to 
the Commonwealth of Independent States from Germany. The first 
one was completed in 1993. The new development consists of 
several nine-floor apartment blocks, a kindergarten, a school, a 
trade and services center, a medical center, and all other 
infrastructure facilities. Over 20 Bulgarian producers took 
part in the construction of the project. Glavbulgarstroy is 
expected to complete another similar project in Rostov-on-Don.

  FUEL PRICES RAISED: On 14 April, the government set ceiling 
prices for liquid fuel for the period 16-30 April. A-98 grade 
gasoline will increase in price to 23.40 leva per liter 
(leva/l); A-96 gasoline will cost 23 leva/l; A-93, 18.20 leva; 
A-91, 18 leva; and A-83, 17 leva. The increase is 3.80 leva/l 
for grades A-98 and A-96, and 2.80 leva/l for the other grades. 
Diesel fuel will cost 14.40 leva/l. Gas oil for industrial and 
household uses is to go up by 0.60 leva/l and will be sold at 
9.74 leva/l. Liquefied petroluem gas will sell at 19.12 leva/l, 
a fall of 1.34 leva. The change in the current international 
prices and the commercial surplus charge, as well as the 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar by 6.75 leva over the last 15 
days, are the main reasons for the increase in liquid fuel 
prices, Vasil Pekhlivanov, chairman of the National Price 
Committee, said. He expects that the new fuel prices will 
cause increases in the prices of the 1,500 consumer items by an 
average of 1.16 percent. (Sofia BTA in English 1608 GMT 14 Apr

  SPANIARDS SEEK TRADE: "We are under the impression that 
Bulgaria will soon be offering good conditions for cooperation 
in trade and economy," Ismael Boj, leader of the Spanish 
business delegation that recently arrived to study the 
possibilities for doing business in Bulgaria, said at a news 
conference in Sofia on 14 April. The delegation includes 
representatives from a dozen Spanish companies, whose production 
was presented at meetings with Bulgarian businessmen. "Our 
initial purpose was to promote exports to Bulgaria, but on 
coming here, we established that we could import Bulgarian goods 
to Spain," one of the Spanish businessmen said. In his view, 
Spanish companies can greatly benefit by importing raw 
materials, especially steel. Some Spanish companies have been 
negotiating with Bulgarian partners and may sign exclusive 
representation rights agreements, but no specific contracts or 
deals have been signed so far, delegation leader Boj said. "In 
1993, the commercial exchange between Bulgaria and Spain reached 
U.S.$65 million, up three times from 1989," noted Mrs. Juana de 
Frutos, commercial attache at the Spanish Embassy in Sofia. She 
said Spain is interested in investing in Bulgaria, but potential 
investors are still undecided because Bulgaria's investment 
legislation is still imperfect. (Sofia BTA in English 1635 GMT 
14 Apr 94) 
  MARCH PRODUCTION: Production increased 2.1 percent in March 
from the same month last year at comparable prices, the press 
reported on 15 April, citing figures from the National 
Statistical Institute (NSI). This is the first reported rise in 
production since the collapse of the Bulgarian economy in 1989. 
Experts believe that it is too early to draw conclusions. The 
growth is mainly due to increased production in the 
petrochemical industry. On the whole, growth in all industries 
was zero in March, having dropped by an average of 5.3 percent 
in the first quarter of the year. Half of the enterprises 
report an increase in sales. The private trading sector has 
been replacing the state-controlled one and already accounts for 
two-thirds of retail turnover, marking a growth of 26.7 percent. 
(Sofia BTA in English 1143 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  APRIL PRICES RISE: Prices rose by 14 percent in the first 12 
days of April, according to a survey of 40 types of foods and 
nonfoods conducted by the National Statistics Institute, which 
include staple goods monitored by the government. Food prices 
increased by an average of 13.1 percent. Beans went up 27 
percent, rice by 40 percent, and yellow cheese by 38 percent. 
Egg prices, however, fell by 1.5 percent. The prices of 
electrical appliances also decreased, but last month they jumped 
two-fold due to the rises in foreign exchange rates. (Sofia BTA 
in English 1144 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  NETHERLANDS BANK BRANCH: The Dutch ING-BANK received 
approval in principle from the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) to 
open a branch in Bulgaria. According to BNB Governor Professor 
Todor Vulchev, this is the sixth strongest bank in Europe. 
(Sofia BTA in English 1548 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  HARD CURRENCY DEPOSITS DECREASE: In the week ending 16 
April, private hard currency deposits fell by 4.5 billion leva, 
according to data issued by the Economic and Monetary Analysis 
Department of the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB). According to 
experts cited by STANDART NEWS, this was due to a relative 
stabilization of the exchange rate, which made people save in 
leva again. Over the same week, leva deposits increased by 0.3 
billion to 105 billion leva. The hard currency deposits of 
state-owned enterprises decreased from 55 billion to 48 billion 
leva over the same period, while their leva deposits decreased 
by 0.4 billion to 17.2 billion. (Sofia BTA in English 0952 GMT

  BANK TO INVEST IN FYROM: The First Private Bank will invest 
in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), its 
executive director Ventsislav Yosifov told the 168 CHASA weekly 
following his return from Skopje. There he conferred with the 
governor of FYROM's central bank, the deputy chairman of the 
Macedonian Economic Chamber, with representatives of the 
government. The First Private Bank is currently holding 
negotiations on buying one of FYROM's banks. (Sofia BTA in 
English 0952 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  PLANTS FACE CLOSURE: According to a report in DUMA on 19 
April that cites Yordan Vasilev, president of the Federation of 
Trade Unions in Light Industry, 16 plants in the cotton textiles 
industry are being threatened with closure due to shortages of 
raw materials. Other enterprises in this sector may also cease 
to operate, which would bring the knitwear and clothing 
industries to a standstill. According to DUMA, the shortage has 
arisen because the Bulgarian Government failed to conclude an 
agreement with the United States on cotton supplies. Vasilev 
claims that 80 percent of companies in the light industry sector 
have been operating at a loss and their output has fallen by 50 
percent. (Sofia BTA in English 1040 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  RICE CULTIVATION DECLINES: Bulgaria has 24,000 hectares of 
rice fields but, according to DEMOKRATSIYA on 19 April, 
nine-tenths of them will not be put under crops this year. 
Before the economic crisis, rice yields reached 50,000 tonnes a 
year from 13,000 hectares, but they fell to 10,000 tonnes in 
1993. According to Agriculture Ministry statistics, only 2,300 
hectares will be sown with rice in 1994, so Bulgaria will have 
to import rice to meet domestic demand. The newspaper notes 
that farmers find rice-growing unprofitable and have not 
concluded any irrigation contracts with the Water Management 
Company. (Sofia BTA in English 1040 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  VIETNAM SERVICES DEBT: After the expiry of the debt 
servicing protocol signed by Bulgaria and Vietnam in 1993, 
Vietnam will still owe approximately 80 million transferable 
rubles to Bulgaria, the TRUD daily reported on 19 April, citing 
First Deputy Agriculture Minister Rumen Khristov, who chairs the 
Bulgarian- Vietnamese Governmental Commission for Trade and 
Economic Cooperation. Vietnam has been repaying its debt 
strictly according to schedule, supplying Bulgaria with goods 
agreed upon in advance by the governments of the two countries, 
TRUD notes. Three years ago, trade turnover with Vietnam 
totalled U.S.$6.75 million. It fell to $1.7 million in 1992, 
but recovered in 1993 by 32 percent to reach $2.25 million. 
(Sofia BTA in English 1040 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  NETHERLANDS TRADE DECLINES: According to the Bulgarian Trade 
Ministry, two-way trade with the Netherlands totalled U.S.$116 
million in 1993, down from $124 million in 1992. Bulgaria has 
had a trade deficit with the Netherlands since 1989, except in 
1991, when Bulgarian exports exceeded imports by 2.6 million 
dollars. Traditionally, Bulgaria exports products of the 
chemical and food industries, tobacco and wine to the 
Netherlands, and imports machines, textiles and chemicals. 
Contacts between private small and medium-sized businesses are 
intensifying. This year, 500,000 guilders and 1 million leva 
will be invested in a Bulgarian-Dutch project targeted on 
infrastructure and the development of small and medium-sized 
business in Bulgaria. (Sofia BTA in English 1453 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  TRADE BANK RESULTS: The Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank (BFTB) 
held its annual meeting of shareholders today. It reported 
profits of 8 million leva for 1993. The BTFB currently holds 
joint stock capital valued at 1.2 billion leva. The shareholders 
also discussed issues related to extending the branch network of 
the BFTB, enhancing its activities, and winning new positions in 
the domestic financial market. They also discussed the issue of 
a merger with two regional commercial banks in Burgas and Stara 
Zagora. (Sofia BTA in English 1621 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  CAPITAL FOR JOINT BANK WITH RUSSIA: More than 500 million 
leva was deposited today to set up a Bulgarian- Russian 
Investment Bank. So far, the share of the Russian stockholders 
is approximately 150 million leva, deposited by the Union of 
Manufacturers and Industrialists, the International 
Privatization and Foreign Investment Fund, the Committee for 
Tourism, four banks, and some 20 enterprises. The Bulgarian 
side is represented by 11 banks and the major economic 
organizations in power engineering, construction and transport. 
"This is perhaps the first bank in Bulgaria to raise this 
amount of capital from the very beginning. The capital will be 
increased to 2 billion leva through open subscription," said 
Emil Khursev, chief of the Khursev and Co. Limited partnership 
that will deal with the formalities for establishing the bank 
and apply for its registration. The signing of the constituent 
documents is scheduled for 19 May. The new bank plans first to 
invest in extending the gas pipeline network to Bulgaria and its 
neighbors, establishing a direct ferry link between Varna and 
Novorossiysk, and exporting Bulgarian tobacco processing 
capacities to Russia. (Sofia BTA in English 1623 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  ROTHMANS BUYS SHARES: According to a report in the 24 CHASA 
daily on 20 April, Rothmans of Britain has bought the entire 
issue of 55 million leva worth of shares in Sofia's cigarette 
factory, which were issued to increase the company's capital. A 
commentary in the same paper is entitled: "Bulgartabak Bought 
Dirt Cheap by Foreigners as Well." STANDART NEWS, however, 
reported that only half the shares were bought, while the 
remainder are still available for purchase by Bulgarian and 
other companies. (Sofia BTA in English 1123 GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  VIDIN-ROTTERDAM RUN: A private ship will run between Vidin 
(on the Danube) and Rotterdam, the KESH financial daily reported 
on 20 April. The exclusive passenger boat "Vidin," which was 
launched only last week, will eventually sail via the 
Danube-Rhine-Main Canal, carrying passengers and cargo. For the 
time being, however, the boat will serve the Vidin-Izmail route. 
(Sofia BTA in English 1123 GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  AFRICAN BRIDGE CONTRACT: The Bulgarian labor service has won 
a tender to build a bridge connecting Zimbabwe and the Republic 
of South Africa across the Limpopo River, the press reported on 
21 April, citing Labor Service Chief General Radoslav 
Peshleevski. The bridge will be 540 metres long and 9.6 metres 
wide, with a projected capacity of 1,000 vehicles and 10,000 
pedestrians a day. Its construction will cost $6 million, 
provided jointly by the Governments of Zimbabwe and South 
Africa. The Bulgarian offer proposes to complete the project in 
one year. Construction will start in May with equipment, 
materials and experts provided by Bulgaria. (Sofia BTA in 
English 1042 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  GDP FOR 1993: Bulgaria's GDP was 286 billion leva in 1993, 
the TRUD daily reported on 21 April, quoting data released by 
the National Statistical Institute. This represented a fall of 
4.2 per cent from 1992. (Sofia BTA in English 1042 GMT 21 Apr 
94) 
  GOLD RESERVES: The BNB press office announced on 21 April 
that the Governing Board of the central Bulgarian National Bank 
(BNB) has decided to increase the national gold reserves to 
1,031,222 troy ounces, up from 1,017,041 troy ounces. (Sofia BTA 
in English 1713 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  ENTERPRISE LIQUIDATION: The Ministry of Industry has 
approved the first five enterprises put up for liquidation, the 
PARI daily reported on 25 April. The list includes mining and 
mechanical engineering operations. Last year their operational 
income totalled 3.5 million leva, half of the 1992 figure, 
according to Deputy Industry Minister Grigori Vazov. The 
enterprises in liquidation can be privatized if buyers are 
found, KONTINENT reported, adding that the Industry Ministry has 
put more than 80 enterprises up for sale but not a single 
potential buyer has come forward. (Sofia BTA in English 1025 GMT 
25 Apr 94) 
  INFLATION ERODES SAVINGS: March inflation eroded time- 
deposit savings by 3.17 leva for each 100 leva, STANDART NEWS 
reported on 25 April. The daily quotes bank figures, according 
to which time deposits pay an average monthly interest of 4.04 
percent, whereas inflation in March was 7.5 per cent, according 
to the National Statistical Institute. The depreciation of 
savings is expected to be even higher in April. (Sofia BTA in 
English 1025 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  RUSSIAN NUCLEAR FUEL: KONTINENT reported on 27 April that 
the 
National Electricity Company (NEC) made an offer to Russia to 
pay for nuclear fuel on a barter basis; Russia, however, has 
shown no interest in barter deals so far. According to the NEC, 
the nuclear fuel to be delivered in 1994 would cost $60 million, 
an amount Bulgaria cannot afford to pay in hard currency. 
(Sofia BTA in English 0958 GMT 27 Apr 94)

April that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD) plans to invest in telecommunications as part of a new 15 
billion leva project. The EBRD is ready to invest in the 
project, provided that the Bulgarian Government, the employers, 
and the trade unions offer guarantees that the terms of the 
agreement will be observed. Part of the amount is to be raised 
by Bulgaria by increasing the rates for telecommunications 
services. (Sofia BTA in English 0958 GMT 17 Apr 94) 
  ENTERPRISES TO BE EXCHANGED: Some 40 enterprises, each 
valued at over 70 million leva, are on a list of property to be 
exchanged against the foreign debt, Privatization Agency 
Director Reneta Indzhova said on 26 April, according to TRUD. 
Indzhova explained that it was an indicative list and more 
enterprises could be added to it upon request from the 
investors. She added that the list had been compiled to include 
mainly export- oriented enterprises, but declined to comment 
further. The enterprises will be obtainable in exchange for 
convertible foreign debt bonds. (Sofia BTA in English 0958 GMT

  BOHEMIA BANK LOSES LICENSE: The Czech National Bank Board 
withdrew with an immediate effect from the Bohemia Bank its 
foreign currency license for payment contacts abroad. In 
future, the Bohemia Bank will be licensed only to exchange money 
and maintain foreign currency accounts. The Bohemia Bank issued 
Prime Bank Guarantees and Bank Guarantees, thereby violating the 
banking laws. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 22 Mar 94 p 16) 
  BANK BUILDS EQUITY: While Prime Bank Guarantees issued by 
the Bohemia Bank contrary to the bookkeeping laws are still with 
the Swiss ($300 million worth) and German ($14 million) 
partners, and cannot yet be withdrawn, they have not been traded 
and an agreement will certainly be reached. In the meantime, 
the Bohemia Bank reports 1993 profits of Kc100 million, and 
plans to raise additional capital of Kc200 million. (Prague 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 28 Mar 94 p 2) 
  LESS FOR PRIVATIZATION: In the preliminary round of the 
second wave of privatization, citizens entrusted 3.92 billion 
coupon points (or 63.5 percent of the total) to investment and 
mutual privatization funds. This is almost 10 percent less than 
in the first wave. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 22 Mar 94 p 2) 
  VW, SKODA LOSSES: Volkswagen, VW, ended 1993 with a loss of 
1.94 billion German marks, DM (1992 profit of DM147 million, 
1991 profit of DM1.1 billion). Skoda Mlada Boleslav was the 
only VW Group mark that increased production last year by almost 
10 percent. Nevertheless, following last year's profit of DM233 
million, this year, it joined the losing subsidiaries with a 
loss of DM246 million. One reason for the loss is the change in 
bookkeeping in the Czech Republic. According to Western 
European standards, Skoda would have closed with a profit of DM8 
million (still a fall from DM70 million in 1992). (Prague 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 25 Mar 94 pp 1, 22) 
  FOREIGN BANKS PROVIDE CREDIT: According to the Czech Banking 
Association, the foreign banks' share of total credit provided 
in the Czech Republic amounts to only 3.2 percent. Before full 
convertibility is introduced, foreign banks are focusing on more 
profitable services. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 25 Mar 
94 p 2) 
  SKODA PURCHASES ERFURT ENTERPRISE: Skoda Plzen has taken 
over Umform Technik Erfurt. This company manufactures car-body 
presses, farm machinery, and consumer products (sales of DM200 
million). The contract, signed in Berlin on 24 March, specifies 
that Skoda will temporarily employ the company's staff of 1,645, 
later reducing the number to 1,000. The Plzen concern will 
invest DM150 million to modernize the enterprise. Skoda owns 90 
percent of the enterprise. (Prague DENNI TELEGRAF in Czech 26 
Mar 94 p 6) 
  CSA SHARES SOLD: Transport Minister Strasky, representing 
the National Property Fund, and Air France President Rudolf 
Frantz signed an agreement on 25 March for the Konsolidacni 
Banka to purchase Air France's stake (52,248 shares, 19.1 
percent worth $27 million) in the Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA). 
(Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 26 Mar 94 p 1) 
  VW NEGOTIATIONS: Following the unexpected refusal of DM1.4 
billion credit for Skoda and the reduction of the planned 
investments from DM7.1 to DM3.7 billion, the VW management has 
abandoned the idea of building a new engine plant in Mlada 
Boleslav. According to former Industry Minister Vrba, one of the 
negotiators, however, the Czech side will not accept this 
decision. As a matter of fact, he says, VW should guarantee the 
production of two new models and the introduction of the Czech 
suppliers in the VW network. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in 
Czech 29 Mar 94 p 2) 
  AUSTRIAN COMPANY BUYS IN: The Ergee Schrems textile concern 
purchased 51-percent stake in Roznov garments manufacturer (one 
of the largest Czech producer of infant clothing, childrens' 
textiles, and hosiery). The financial transaction took place 
last July, but the actual association of the companies is only 
taking place now. By the end of February, the Austrian partner 
equipped Loana with new technology valued at Kc100 million, and 
the company's output doubled. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in 
Czech 29 Mar 94 p 6) 
  SKODA TERMINATES STASIS TALKS: Skoda Plzen and Stasis 
(Stavebni a Silnicni Stroje, Construction and Road Machines) 
Horni Slavkov have been discussing the foundation of a joint 
venture since the middle of 1993. The Skoda management is to 
terminate the talks, however, because they feel that "the 
conduct of Stasis is speculative and its demands do not 
correspond to the original intentions." (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 29 Mar 94 p 6) 
  INTEREST RATES: CSOB (Czechoslovak Trade Bank) alters its 
interest rates. Beginning 1 April, the minimum credit rate is 
11 percent, the basic interest rate for short-term (less than 
one year) loans is 12.75 percent, two-year credit is 14.5 
percent annually, and three-year credit is 15.9 percent. 
(Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 29 Mar 94 p 9) 
  DISAGREEMENT OVER FARM POLICY: Entrepreneurial 
representatives in the Council of Economic and Social Agreement, 
comprising representatives of the government, employers, and 
trade unions, expressed their disagreement today with the 
government's agriculture policy, said Jan Fencl, president of 
the Czech-Moravian Association of Agricultural Cooperatives, 
after a meeting of the Tripartite Council. They think that 
government policy is merely shelving the solution to the current 
agriculture problems. "We understand the accepted policy as 
another government decision not to resolve the absurd situation 
in agriculture," stressed Fencl. Entrepreneurs feel that 
agricultural producers are unable to extricate themselves from 
current economic difficulties without government support. The 
farmers are the victims of two kinds of pressure: one from 
monopoly suppliers and the other from monopoly purchasers of 
agricultural products. The profitability of agricultural 
operations during the last three years has varied from -6.7 to 
-10 percent. (Prague CTK in English 1622 GMT 31 Mar 94) 
  TOURISM STATISTICS: Almost 10.6 million foreigners have 
visited the Czech Republic since the beginning of 1994. That is 
a 21 percent increase from the same period last year, the Czech 
Statistical Office said in a report presented to CTK on 31 
March. Out of this number, 910,493 people crossed the Slovak 
border in that period. Some 5.7 million Germans have visited 
the Czech Republic, which is a 27.1-percent increase against 
January and February 1993, 1.6 million Austrians, an increase of 
5.1 percent against the same period of 1993, and about 2.3 
million Poles, which represents a 20- percent increase. In the 
same period, about 4.2 million Czechs travelled abroad, and the 
Slovak border was crossed by 436,605 people. (Prague CTK in 
English 2000 GMT 31 Mar 94) 
  UKRAINE ENVOY ON TRADE: Ukrainian Ambassador to the Czech 
Republic Roman Lubkivski believes that there are pre-requisites 
for Ukrainian-Czech trade to grow to 10 times its current level. 
Ukrainian Counselor Mykhaylo Kuckir said that about 350 
Czech-Ukrainian joint stock companies and firms had been 
established so far. He pointed to problems in mutual payments 
which still existed but did not specify them. He said that 
agriculture, food industry, consumer goods production, 
restructuring metallurgical and machine plant and nuclear power 
stations offered good prospects for Czech-Ukrainian cooperation. 
He also mentioned the idea of establishing a joint 
Czech-Ukrainian bank in the summer. (Prague CTK in English 1601 
GMT 1 Apr 94) 
  DECREASING LABOR FORCE -- The very low unemployment rate in 
the Czech Republic is largely a result of its generally 
decreasing labor force, according to an analysis of the Vienna 
Institute for International Economic Comparisons. Overall the 
Czech Republic's labor force has declined from 5.7 million 
people in 1989 to the present 4.8 million. With its 3.7 percent 
unemployment, the Czech Republic is better than not only the 
other reform countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but also 
many Western countries. The number of job-seekers in the Czech 
Republic is, however, expected to double this year, says the 
institute's study, which is thus at variance with more 
optimistic conclusions by the Czech Government. (Prague CTK in 
English 0821 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
  MAHART TO REQUEST COMPENSATION -- The Hungarian shipping 
company Mahart has not yet worked out the financial loss that it 
suffered from the cut in Danube River transportation caused by 
the blockage of the Gabcikovo lock but will be asking the Slovak 
authorities for damages, Manhart representative Laszlo Koszonics 
told the Hungarian News Agency MTI today. He said that about 20 
Mahart ships and barges are moored near Vienna and Bratislava, 
with others waiting for the resumption of river transportation 
in Hungarian ports. (Prague CTK in English 1010 GMT 6 Apr 94) 
  PRELIMINARY PRIVATIZATION ROUND: Of the 6.17 million 
registered coupon holders, 3.97 million participated in the 
preliminary round of the second wave of privatization. This is 
64 percent of all the coupon holders. A total of 3.87 million 
coupon holders have entrusted all their privatization points 
(1,000 per coupon holder) to privatization funds. The 
privatization funds are administering 3.92 million points, which 
is 65.5 percent of all the available points. This is about 10 
percent less than in the first wave. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY 
in Czech 22 Mar 94) 
  NATIONAL BANK'S ASSETS, LIABILITIES: Ceska Narodni Banka's 
(Czech National Bank) assets and liabilities reached 385.13 
korunas (Kc), which is 15.5 billion more than on 28 February. 
This figure was provided by the bank's press department 
yesterday. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 22 Mar 94) 
  CULTURAL OBJECTS EXPORT LAW: The parliament passed a bill on 
23 March limiting the export of objects of cultural value and 
completely liberalizing trade in them on the domestic market. 
According to the law, artistic works may only be exported with 
a certificate issued by professional organizations, such as 
museums, galleries, cultural monument institutes, and the 
Ministry of Culture. Before the bill was passed, the parliament 
accepted an amendment requiring that export certificates also be 
obtained for original works by artists who have been dead less 
than 50 years, as long as the works are in the possession of the 
artist's direct descendants. (Prague CTK in English 1551 GMT 23 
Mar 94) 
  COMMISSION FOR UKRAINE TRADE: "It is delightful that despite 
all the economic crisis phenomena and our passing through a 
complex period of transformation, our mutual relations have not 
significantly suffered." Ukrainian External Economic Relations 
Minister Oleh Slyepichev stated this in an interview for 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY following his talks with the Czech economy 
ministers, with whom he signed, at the end of last week, 
treaties on economic cooperation and support, and mutual 
protection of investments. "Because mutual relations used to be 
centrally controlled, we are searching for suitable mechanisms 
for their revival," the minister said. That was one of the 
reasons why the Ukrainian External Economic Relations Ministry 
and the Czech Industry and Trade Ministry agreed to create a 
mixed, broadly conceived inter- departmental commission that 
would devote itself to the building of mutual relations. The 
volume of mutual trade has markedly declined in recent years to 
reach a current turnover value of approximately $200 million. 
Trade is more or less balanced. Of the specific priorities in 
mutual trade, the minister pointed to the pressing need for 
restoration and continuous supply of spare parts for the 
extensive pool of Czech trolleybuses and streetcars in Ukrainian 
cities. Ukraine, for its part, used to supply the Czech 
Republic with iron ore and it would be difficult to find a 
replacement for this market. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in

  SKODA, VW DIFFER ON PROFITS: The Skoda car manufacturer 
registered a slight profit of 7 million German marks (DM) in 
1993, spokesman Milan Smutny told the Reuter news agency today, 
rejecting information from Volkswagen, its joint venture 
partner, that Skoda would make a loss of DM246 million. The 
wide divergence of figures is due to different methods of 
accounting used in the Czech Republic and Germany, he said. The 
definitive results will be presented at the general assembly of 
shareholders on April 15. Volkswagen's financial director 
Werner Schmidt, announcing the results of the Volkswagen Group 
today, said Skoda's DM246 million loss was due to restructuring 
costs. (Prague CTK 1908 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT PACT RATIFIED: The parliament today 
ratified an agreement between the Czech Republic and Australia 
on bilateral support and protection of investments. The 
agreement was signed by the two governments in the Australian 
capital, Canberra, on September 30, 1993. The agreement 
expresses the Czech Republic's interest in developing mutually 
advantageous forms of economic cooperation, creating a suitable 
environment for direct foreign investment, and encouraging 
entrepreneurial activity by Czech nationals. It provides for 
the bilateral granting of most- favored-nation trading status, 
for investment-related payments to be made in convertible 
currency, and for guarantees that investments by one state will 
be protected from internal measures of the other, such as 
nationalization. (Prague CTK in English 1614 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  CENTRAL BANK CURRENCY REPORT: Basic macroeconomic stability 
was maintained in the Czech Republic and the decline in 
productivity was slowed down and nearly halted after the

old clearing account, Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said 
today after Czech-Slovak negotiations in Smolenice. Slovak

that the state should make up the difference. All liabilities 
on the old account are to be converted into ECUs and transferred

the transformation phase, includes all the basic reform 
measures. In the subsequent stage there are no visible new 
reforms but the reform process is deepened and improved. It is 
important to proceed with reform decisively and rapidly 
throughout, he said. Today Klaus also met Finnish Deputy Premier 
and Minister of Foreign Trade Pertti Salolainen. The talks 
focused chiefly on EU integration. Salolainen said Finnish 
advice particularly on the EU's regional and agricultural policy 
could be very useful to the Czech Republic. (Prague CTK in

the most undervalued currency in Central Europe apart from the 
Slovak koruna. This is despite an 18 percent real revaluation 
against the U.S. dollar over the last three and a half years.

industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, electrical engineering, and 
textile and glass industries, Ecler reported. In spite of this, 
75 per cent of the total industrial research and development is

and exports to 15,273 tonnes. The Czech Republic last year 
imported 21,155 tonnes of milk and dairy products and exported 
152,078 tonnes. Lux said there were problems in imports of 
wine, fruit and vegetables because these commodities were highly 
subsidised by the European Union. Referring to non-profit 
areas, Lux said that government aid to regional programs 
amounted last year to Kc300 million and this year was expected 
to reach Kc400 million. He went on to say that at present 57 
percent of state farms were privatized and most of the remaining 
farms were run by lessees on the basis of contracts concluded

  SKODA MEETING SUSPENDED: The general meeting of shareholders 
of the Skoda car maker on 15 April was suspended because of 
personnel changes, and will be resumed only after its new 
executive officers get acquainted in detail with the company's 
performance, Skoda's spokesman announced. Jiri Hrabovsky said 
after the meeting that Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik had 
succeeded National Property Fund chairman Tomas Jezek in 
representing the rights of the Czech majority stake in the 
Skoda-Volkswagen joint venture. The meeting elected Industry 
and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy to the supervisory council. 
Volkswagen was represented at the meeting by President of the 
Board Ferdinand Piech and Secretary Kristian Ehinger. (Prague 
CTK in English 1828 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  SKODA IN IRAN: Skoda Plzen will substantially expand its 
operation abroad and it will establish an enterprise in Iran. 
This is guaranteed by a contract signed on 14 April by Skoda 
Director General Soudek and President of Iranian Development 
Agency (IDRA) Khamoosi. Several joint ventures are planned, and 
the first one of them -- a trolleybus assembly company -- should 
be founded within three months. (Prague MLADA FRONTA DNES in 
Czech 16 Apr 94 p 14) 
  AGROBANKA INCREASES EQUITY: The general meeting of 
shareholders of Agrobanka decided not to pay dividends this year 
and instead to add the money (Kc340 million) to its equity. The 
company will also issue new shares to raise additional capital 
(Kc500 million) so its equity will increase from the current Kc 
1.7 billion to Kc2.54 billion. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 16

  JAPANESE WIN CONTRACT: The Opatovice Power Plants Co. chose 
from among 27 -- mostly foreign -- bidding firms the Japanese 
consortium JGC and Kawasaki to construct a Kc1.4 billion 
desulfurization plant at its 330MW power plant. (Prague MLADA 
FRONTA DNES in Czech 18 Apr 94 p 14) 
  SPT TELECOM TO ISSUE BONDS: The first general meeting of 
shareholders of the SPT Telecom on 15 April decided to issue 
company bonds in the value of Kc1 billion. (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 18 Apr 94 p 2) 
  ZIELENIEC, VIETNAMESE DISCUSS TRADE: Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec met with Vietnamese Minister of Trade Le Van Triet to 
discuss economic and trade relations. Later, he told 
journalists that he considered talks on this topic to be the 
most important part of his visit to Vietnam. The two ministers 
discussed specific projects. Le Van Triet was interested in 
very close cooperation in food processing industry. Vietnamese 
partners took interest in the draft project for tripartite 
cooperation which means Vietnamese raw materials, Czech 
technology, and some foreign capital. The ministers also 
discussed the delivery of 40 locomotives from the Czech CKD 
engineering works to Vietnam. Zieleniec informed his partner 
that CKD allegedly found a way of satisfying the conditions of a 
loan that the Vietnamese are ready to accept. A prepared trade 
agreement which has so far been made conditional on repayment of 
Czech claims in Vietnam was a topic for discussion. Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Vit Kurfurst said that Vietnam's debt was 
worth $4.5 million and that Vietnam had no money to repay it. 
However, Hanoi had already prepared a scheme of how the debt 
would be repaid, he said. (Prague CTK in English 1618 GMT 16 
Apr 94) 
Czech businessmen and industrialists accompanying Zieleniec on 
the trip discussed the difficulties of developing trade 
relations with Vietnam today. Rostislav Levicek Zbrojovka arms 
manufacturing company said that Vietnamese legislation forbade 
the import of weapons for hunting and other sports, which his 
company would like to export to Vietnam. Miroslav Fucik of 
Tatra Koprivnice brought up the financial difficulties of 
establishing a joint venture. He added that his company's cars 
would have stiff competition in Vietnam from KamAZ cars, which 
cost half as much. Several businessmen mentioned the difficulty 
of competing in Vietnam, given its low prices and cheap cost of 
labor. Vladimir Riha of CZ Strakonice, for example, stated that 
the production cost of a bicycle in Vietnam was only $50. 
Skodaexport would like to supply water turbines to Vietnam, but 
it would have to convince banks to grant it loans in order to do 
so, business director Tibor Durina said. Another problem for 
Czech exports to Vietnam is that about 30 percent of Czech 
exports to Vietnam are sold through a third country, Tomas Husak 
of the Trade and Industry Ministry said. (Prague CTK in English 
1935 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  TURKS NOT BUYING SKODAS: Over 2,000 Czech Skoda cars have 
been stored for more than six weeks at the speedway stadium at 
Slany, central Bohemia, because their Turkish dealer has not 
found buyers for them and has nowhere to store them. The 
spokesman for Skoda, Jiri Hrabovsky, told CTK on 18 April that 
the reason of the situation had been mainly a crisis on the 
Turkish car market. Yuce, a Turkish car dealer who used to sell 
3,000 Skodas per month, had purchased 4,000 cars without 
catalytic converters from Skoda. But the collapse of the 
Turkish market, related to internal political problems which may 
lead to an increase in interest rates of 250 percent, has left 
the firm unable to sell the cars and without any place to store 
them. A part of the automobile shipment was thus held up in the 
Czech Republic, to be stored by Skoda at Yuce's expense. "In 
order to help out our Turkish associate, we're looking for a 
customer who wouldn't mind that the cars don't have catalytic 
converters," Hrabovsky said. (Prague CTK in English 1625 GMT 18 
Apr 94) 
  INDUSTRIAL GOODS PRICES RISE: According to Czech Statistical 
Office, the average price of industrial goods rose in the first 
three months of the year 6.2 percent in comparison with the same 
period in 1993. The largest increase was recorded in 
construction -- 16 percent -- while the prices of food rose 
marginally -- 1.7 percent. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in English 19 
Apr 94 p 7) 
  AGROBANKA LOWERS RATES: On 15 April, Agrobanka lowered the 
interest it charges on new credits by 1.5 percent. Thus, the 
basic interest rate declined to 12.5 percent and prime rate to 
9.5 percent. Similarly, the interest paid on deposits has been 
reduced. The interest paid on current accounts, for instance, 
declined by 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY 
in English 19 Apr 94 p 7) 
  CSA RIDERSHIP IMPROVES: More than 120,000 people flew on 
Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) regular flights in the first two 
months of this year, which is a 5-percent increase against the 
same period last year, Eva Presova from the CSA press department 
told CTK ON 19 April. The majority of the people flew to Great 
Britain (London, Manchester), Germany (Frankfurt, Berlin, 
Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Munich), Slovakia and Russia (Moscow and 
St.Petersburg). Among the intercontinental flights, the most 
popular destination was Thailand, with 6,206 passengers, 
followed by the United States (New York, Chicago) with 5,823 
passengers, and Canada (Montreal, Toronto) with 2,972 
passengers. (Prague CTK in English 1100 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  NEW BANKNOTES: The Czech National Bank (CNB) is going to put 
a new Kc20 banknote into circulation on 20 April, a CNB 
spokesman announced today. The new notes were printed at the 
State Mint in Prague. On the front they have a drawing of 
Premysl Otakar I, the Bohemian prince of the early 13th century 
who ushered in the century-long reign of the Premyslide dynasty. 
A Kc2000 banknote will also be introduced in May or June. The 
possibility of exchanging stamped Kc200, Kc500, or Kc1000 notes 
from the Czechoslovak federation will continue until May 31, at 
which time the Czech Republic's currency transformation will 
end. (Prague CTK in English 1352 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  SKODA SALES DOWN: Skoda Mlada Boleslav sold 43,562 cars in 
the first quarter -- that is, 9,711 fewer than in the same 
period last year. The company sold 11,944 cars in the Czech 
Republic (5,927 fewer than last year), 1,132 cars were exported 
to Slovakia (3,249 fewer), and 17,585 cars were sold in Western 
Europe (581 fewer). (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 20 Apr 94 p 16) 
  BANK OWNERSHIP: As a result of the share transfers over the 
past two years, a total of 49 percent of the Ceska Banka are 
held by the largest Latvian bank Baltija. The Ceska Banka has 
equity of 800 million korunas (Kc) and shares 10th and 11th 
place in the Czech Republic with the Bohemia Bank. The bank's 
after-tax profits reached Kc69 million last year. (Prague 
LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 14 Apr 94 FINANCNI NOVINY supplement p ii) 
  GERMAN INVESTMENT: According to the Czech-German Chamber of 
Industry and Commerce, German enterprises show more restraint in 
investments here, but in 1993, the FRG remained the country 
where most of the direct investments originated. The German 
investment, however, only reached $82 million, which is not 
much. There are 67,000 enterprises with German participation in 
the Czech Republic. According to a survey, approximately 
one-third of all German firms would like to transfer a part or 
the total of its production abroad, and about 50 percent of them 
favor the Czech Republic. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 14 Apr

  PRAGUE SUBWAY: Thanks to the quick sale of Prague municipal 
bonds on the London Stock Exchange, an addition to the B line of 
Prague's metro (subway) will be completed on schedule in 1998, 
Prague Mayor Jan Koukal told correspondents today. The metro 
addition will be partly financed from the bonds' sale because 
even this year's subsidies from the municipal budget, totalling 
Kc1.1 billion ($36.700 million), will not cover all the costs. 
A 5.1-kilometer segment is being added to Metro B extending 
from Nove Butovice, and a 6.4-kilometer segment is also being 
added in the other direction, from Ceskomoravska. The 
Japanese-based Nomura bank introduced $250 million worth of 
municipal bonds to the international financial market on April 
15. (Prague CTK in English 1327 GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  DRESDEN-PRAGUE HIGHWAY: On 20 April, the Saxon Government 
approved the southern variant of the Dresden-Prague highway, the 
construction of which, costing about 1.2 to 1.8 billion German 
marks, would begin in 1996 and be finished in 2002. Saxon 
Economy Minister Kajo Schommer and Minister of the Environment 
Arnold Vaatz told correspondents today that a Saxon- Czech 
compromise concerning the route respected economic, 
transportation, and environmental aspects. Under the project, 
the highway will have three tunnels, the longest one measuring 
1,650 meters, and three bridges. (Prague CTK in English 1742 
GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  MOVE TO INSURE DEPOSITS: Deputy Zdenek Vorlicek from the 
opposition Left Bloc (LB) group yesterday sent Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus a parliamentary question suggesting that the 
government include the drawing up of a bill insuring bank 
deposits in its program for the second half of 1994. This 
suggestion was prompted by the central bank's freeze on 
citizens' deposits in Banka Bohemia following a dramatic 
decrease in its liquidity. The lack of insurance for deposits 
could undermine confidence in the banking sector, cause 
depositors to avoid small banks, and strengthen the already 
dominant position of "the big four banks," whose deposits are 
insured by the government, Vorlicek wrote. The "big four" are 
Ceska sporitelna (Czech Savings Company), Komercni banka 
(Commercial Bank), Investicni and postovni banka (Investment and 
Postal Bank) and Zivnostenska banka (Trades Bank). He also urges 
that the future law be in harmony with similar norms valid in 
the European Union as of January 1, 1995. (Prague CTK in 
English 1736 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  CONTACTS WITH CHILE: A group of some 70 representatives of 
Czech companies and banks visited Chile to establish new 
contacts with Chilean partners and to seek ways of expanding 
bilateral trade. Czech-Chilean trade exchange was almost 
nonexistent for many years, but it has markedly increased over 
the past two years to reach $7.1 million in 1993. This makes 
Chile the Czech Republic's 10th largest trading partner in Latin 
America. (Prague CTK in English 2057 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  PRIVATIZATION FRAUD: Experts believe that tens of thousands 
of people cheated in the second round of privatization when they 
registered more coupon books than just the one to which they 
were entitled. They could have caused the funds damage running 
into millions. According to the Coupon Privatization Center, 
33,000 registered books had to be frozen for the staff to verify 
whether the birth registry numbers of their owners coincided or 
whether they had registered the book several times. The police 
believe that identical numbers are rare and that most of these 
coincidences are intentional fraud. (Prague MLADA FRONTA DNES 
in Czech 22 Apr 94 p 1) 
  MORE SHARES TO BE SOLD: The government has approved the sale 
of all shares that the National Property Fund did not manage to 
sell in the first wave of privatization. They are to be sold 
just like shares designated for sale through a mediator. The 
Fund currently manages Kc6 billion worth of stock. The actual 
price is 70 percent of the nominal price. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY 
in Czech 22 Apr 94 p 3) 
  HOUSING CONSTRUCTION: According to the Czech Statistical 
Office, 31,509 housing units were completed in the republic in 
1993 (13.4 percent fewer than in the previous year). The number 
was lower in all forms of housing except for detached 
single-family houses (the aftermath of the advantageous loans 
young couple could obtain in 1989-1990). Last year, 7,454 
housing units were started (195 communal, 350 cooperative, 88 
company, and 6,824 units in family houses). The total of 
housing begun was 11.6 percent lower last year than in 1992. On 
last day of 1993, there were 72,356 units under construction, 
54,439 of them in family houses. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 
22 Apr 94 FINANCNI NOVINY supplement p iv) 
  BANK INCREASES CAPITALIZATION: The balance of the Skala 
banking house reached almost Kc4.5 billion in 1993. The 
reserves of the bank (with German capital participation) amount 
to Kc200 million. The shareholders' general meeting in December 
decided to increase the company capital stock to Kc0.5 billion. 
(Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 22 Apr 94 p 8) 
  SKODA PRICES: The prices of cars made by Skoda of Mlada 
Boleslav will go up on May 2, Evzen Krauskopf of Skoda's PR 
Department has announced. The cheapest Favorit will now cost 
Kc196,700 (some $6,556), Kc5,700 or 3 percent more than at 
present, Krauskofp said. (Prague CTK in English 2020 GMT 22 Apr 
94) 
  MEINL OPENS IN PRAGUE: The Austrian concern Julius Meinl 
opened its first store in the Czech Republic on Vinohradska 
Avenue in Prague on 22 April. The 650-square-meter site was 
reconstructed at a cost of Kc10 million and prepared for 
business in just two weeks. The company will offer 5,000 mostly 
Czech goods, and basic food items will be sold at exceptionally 
low prices. According to Julius Meinl (the fourth generation of 
owners), another seven or eight stores in Prague and other major 
cities should be open by the end of the year. The firm is 
planning to expand the network to 30 stores within the next five 
years. The Prague business venture Pronto Plus (one of the 
largest food vendors in the republic, operating two large 
supermarkets in Prague, six smaller stores under the name Lido, 
and three "Cash and Carry" shops) owns a 10-percent stake in 
this company. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 23 Apr 94 p 4) 
  MRS INCREASES OFFER: The International Oil Companies (MRS) 
consisting of Agip, Conoco, Shell, and Total has offered the 
Industry and Trade Minstry a "much higher price" for a 
49-percent stake in Czech Refineries than their last offer of 
$110 million. The actual sum has not been disclosed. The Czech 
Refineries should emerge by separating refineries from Kaucuk 
Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov and their subsequent merger. 
The MRS propose to invest here as much as $1 billion. (Prague 
CESKY DENIK in Czech 23 Apr 94 p 14) 
  SKODA IN CHINA: A machine tool joint venture foundation 
agreement was signed on 21 April by representatives of the 
Quinghai Heavy-Duty Machine Tool Works (60 percent), Skoda Plzen 
(35 percent), and Strojimport Prague (5 percent). The total 
volume of investment is estimated at $350 million. Skoda is to 
supply the production equipment. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 
23 Apr 94 p 14) 
  AUSTRIA CONSTRUCTION FINANCE: The construction of the 
10,000-square-meter administrative and business Holan Center on 
a vacant site next to the Kotva shopping center in Prague will 
cost approximately Kc1.2 billion. It is being financed by 
Immoconsult of Austria, a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Austrian Volksbank. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 25 Apr 
94 p 2) 
  WAGES INCREASE: According to the Czech Statistical Office, 
the average nominal monthly salary in March reached Kc6,789 in 
industry (up 12 percent from March 1993) and Kc7,318 in 
construction (up 22 percent). The average salary for the entire 
first quarter was Kc6,196 in industry (up 13.3 percent from 
1993) and Kc6,519 in construction (up 13.4 percent). (Prague 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 26 Apr 94 p 2) 
  TRADE SURPLUS GROWS: According to the Czech National Bank, 
the average inter-bank rate of interest paid on deposits in 
March rose to the level of the last quarter of 1993. The 
foreign currency reserves of the Czech banking system increased 
from $6.6 billion to $7 billion (of which the CNB from $4.2 
billion to $4.6 billion). The foreign trade surplus rose to $32 
million at the end of February. The gross debt declined in 
January from $8.7 billion to $8.6 billion. The CNB reports 
March rate of inflation as 0.3 percent. (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 26 Apr 94 p 2) 
  NEW ACCIDENT INSURANCE: Motor-vehicle accident insurance for 
large enterprises and companies was introduced by IB Insurance 
Co. in mid-April. The company plans to extend its services to 
individual motorists. In the meantime, in addition to life 
insurance, it offers property coverage. After only two years of 
operations here, IB Insurance Co. has 100,000 customers. 
(Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 26 Apr 94 p 7) 
  TRADE BANK LOSS: The Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank 
financial report shows a loss for 1993. The bank's 1993 gross 
income was 15 percent higher than projected. The loss was 
caused by the creation of bad credit reserves (loans based on 
government political decisions in the past). (Prague LIDOVE 
NOVINY in Czech 26 Apr 94 p 7) 
  TAX PACT WITH ISRAEL: On 27 April the parliament approved an 
agreement between the Czech Republic and Israel, preventing 
double taxation and income tax evasion, which was signed in 
December last year. The agreement will increase the legal 
certainties of investors by allowing the exact calculation of 
earnings from their investment, Economy Minister Karel Dyba said 
in parliament today. (Prague CTK in English 1305 GMT 27 Apr 94)

  CENTRAL BANK DEFENDS FORINT: The Hungarian National Bank 
(MNB) has intervened heavily on the Hungarian money market to 
defend the forint over the last two days. Speculative buying by 
commercial banks was growing and banks were expecting a 
devaluation in the forint. The MNB regularly tests market 
conditions by buying and selling foreign exchange on the 
interbank market. Hungary's foreign exchange reserves of more 
than $7 billion have enabled the central bank to continue to 
meet the commercial banks' demand. The commercial banks' 
purchase has not eaten into the central bank reserves because 
the foreign exchange bought by the banks has been returned to 
the central bank in the form of deposits. In January and 
February, the central bank was a net buyer on the inter-bank 
market, buying $70 million more Forex than it sold in January. 
This sum was slightly less in February. Selling is expected to 
exceed buying in March as the current account deficit may only 
be partly financed by direct foreign cash investments. The 
current account deficit is expected to amount to between $2 
billion and $2.5 billion this year, as against $3.4 billion in 
1993. The central bank estimates that the capital inflow will 
cover the deficit during the year. (Budapest MTI in English 
0851 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  BANK AGREEMENT WITH SLOVAKIA: An agreement on the mutual 
acceptance of the Hungarian forint (HUF) and Slovak koruna (Sk) 
in tourist traffic was signed by the two countries' central bank 
presidents. Under its terms, Hungarian citizens will be allowed 
to take Sk4,000 per person per occasion to Slovakia, instead of 
the previous Sk1,000, while the amount of florints Slovak 
tourists can bring to Hungary has been raised from HUF2,000 to 
HUF10,000. The sale of foreign currency follows the free-market 
practice in both countries: Hungarian and Slovak commercial 
banks run non-commercial accounts in forints and korunas, and if 
a surplus accumulates lastingly in one of the countries, it will 
be possible to use it for commercial deals. (Budapest MTI in 
English 1352 GMT 30 Mar 94) 
  GLASUNION HALTS GLASS PRODUCTION: Glasunion Kft. (limited) 
will stop its plate glass production by 24 March, thus ending 
all plate glass production in Hungary. Glasunion has been 
operating since early last year with the assets of plate glass 
manufacturer Salgotarjani Sikuveggyar, which had previously gone 
bankrupt. The limited company was set up with HUF867 million 
founding capital. The company also manufactures processed 
products such as windscreens, and hardened and heatproof glass. 
Out of total capacity of 8 million square meters a year, only 6 
million square meters were produced last year because of the 
aging technology. Half of all output was exported. Due to 
spending on modernization, which became necessary last year, 
Glasunion closed 1993 with a loss. The net turnover was HUF1.4 
billion last year, of which exports, mainly to Western Europe, 
made up HUF560 million. It also exported indirectly to Russia 
through a $800,000 order for windscreens for Ikarus buses. 
(Budapest MTI in English 0718 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  MALEV SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE SUBSIDIARY: Malev shareholders at 
an extraordinary general meeting on 26 March approved the 
setting up of a wholly owned off-shore subsidiary and a sale and 
lease-back agreement concluded with the company. The Hungarian 
airline, Malev, registered the Aircraft Leasing Company (MALCO) 
in the Cayman Islands late last year. The company has 
registered capital of $2. Malev transferred the ownership of 
two Boeing 767-200ERs, which it purchased last year, to MALCO 
for $1 each and is now leasing the aircraft back. Last year, 
Malev took out a $123 million loan with a maturity of 12 years 
to finance the purchase. Malev can now avoid listing this loan 
in the balance sheet in forints, something which would have a 
negative impact because of forint devaluations. The loan will 
now appear in MALCO's balance sheet in US dollars. (Budapest 
MTI in English 1302.GMT 28 Mar 94) 
  CHINESE RETAILERS FLOURISH: Nearly 40 Chinese restaurants 
operate at present in Budapest, and their number is expected to 
rise to over 100 in two years. Chinese retailers dealing in 
clothing articles are estimated to number 500. Most Chinese -- 
about 40,000 to 50,000 -- stayed in Hungary between 1990 and 
1991, but many times more Chinese passed through the country in 
transit. Stricter entry and residence conditions in effect for 
the last few years have brought down the number of Chinese 
living here to between 5,000 and 10,000. Most of them run 
catering businesses or clothing shops. Chinese restaurants, led 
by Taiwan in business turnover, have an annual turnover of 
several hundred million forints, and obtain half of their raw 
material requirements from Hungarian suppliers. There are 
several Chinese clothiers who sell 300-500 containers of goods a 
year. Some Chinese having settled in Hungary are accumulating 
capital at a rate that they will be able to unleash a new wave 
of ventures within a few years. (Budapest MTI in English 1031 
GMT 28 Mar 94) 
  ELECTRICITY DIVERSIFIED: Ten years ago, Hungary imported 25 
percent of its electricity from the Soviet Union, now the CIS 
states supply less than 10 percent of total Hungarian demand. 
This continuing partial dependence prompted the Visegrad 
countries to set up their own electricity club, CENTREL, in 1992 
as a preliminary move towards joining the electricity 
organization bringing together Western European states, UCPTE, 
within a few years. Hungary's present link to UCPTE, via 
Austria and the rump Yugoslavia, works at low capacity with a 
technically temporary link- up. Parliament passed an energy 
policy plan one year ago to ease the country's excessive 
reliance on the former Soviet Union. Today, Hungary has become 
the least dependent in Eastern Europe on the Soviet successor 
states for electricty supplies: Last year the country imported 
a tenth of its overall consumption of 34-35 billion kilowatthour 
(KWH). The energy plan for this decade anticipates a rising 
need for energy due to a slow increase in industrial and 
agricultural production. To facilitate the country's linkage to 
the Western European electric energy system, from this summer 
regional electricity boards and power stations are to be 
partially privatized with the participation of Western European 
companies. Joining UCPTE is vital to the four Visegrad 
countries to lessen dependence on eastern imports and ensure 
greater technical security. After the UPCTE members decided in 
1992 to support their joint admission, the four energy companies 
set up their own professional club in October 1992. The first 
step to membership was to regulate the transmission frequency of 
the four national electricity systems to meet UCPTE standards, 
because the parallel mode of operation, which ensures the best 
linkage, cannot be applied at frequency fluctuations larger than 
UCPTE levels. After a two-day successful CENTREL network test 
late last September, full linkage is expected in 1997 at the 
earliest. Hungary's electricity system is presently connected 
to the UCPTE circuit with a direct-current insert which 
equalises frequency fluctuations. A 400 kilovolt (KV) branch 
from Szeged (southern Hungary) to rump Yugoslavia and 220 KV 
line between Gyor (W Hungary) and Vienna enable Hungary to 
export power in lieu of Austrian capital invested earlier in the 
hydroelectric Danube dam project, and to transfer Ukrainian 
power deliveries to Austria. The Munich-based Bayernwerke, 
Germany's leading energy supplier and an old business partner of 
the Hungarian Electricity Board, will help set up technical and 
organizational conditions for the link-up under a cooperation 
agreement signed recently in Budapest. (Budapest MTI in English 
0824 GMT 29 Mar 94) 
  DROP IN UNEMPLOYMENT: The rate of registered unemployment 
continued to fall in February, the National Labor Center said. 
At the end of this February there were 630,600 registered 
jobless in Hungary -- 10,300 fewer than in the previous month 
and 74,400 fewer than the maximum of 705,000 in February 1993. 
In the past year the rate of unemployment has dropped by 0.2 
percentage points, to 12.6 percent. Compared to January 1994, 
3,500 more, altogether 26,300 new vacancies were registered in 
February, most of them in agriculture. Altogether, 54,700 
vacant jobs were awaiting the unemployed in February, of which 
44 percent were taken in the course of the month. (Budapest MTI

  JANUARY PRODUCTION RISES: The volume of industrial 
production rose in January, according to the Central Statistical 
Office. Based on data from ventures employing more than 20 
workers, industrial production was valued at 170.2 billion 
forints (HUF) at current prices in the first month of the year, 
up 10.5 percent on the December 1993 figure, and 13.5 percent 
higher than a year ago. Industrial sales were valued at HUF160.2 
billion, within which domestic sales totalled HUF124.6 billion, 
exports HUF35.6 billion. Domestic sales rose by 8.4 percent, 
exports by 31 percent over one year. (Budapest MTI in English 
0655 GMT 31 Mar 94) 
  TREASURY BILLS: The stock of two treasury bills of one year 
maturity -- the interest paying and the public treasury bills -- 
reached HUF44.9 billion forints earlier in March, according to 
information from distributors received on March 22 by the 
Finance Ministry's Securities Office. These bills are primarily 
designed for sale to the public. The office has since reported 
that the current stock is around HUF43.7 billion, because 
although HUF6.6 billion worth of interest paying T-bills have 
expired, a new series was issued in March to a value of HUF5.4 
billion, and there have been no significant redemptions. The 
stock of the two types of securities increased by 85 percent 
from the end of last September, which shows that the public has 
been directly financing the budget at an increasing rate. Of 
the two types of T- bills, the outstanding stock of the 
so-called public treasury bills is HUF14.1 billion. The stock 
of interest paying treasury bills is estimated at HUF29.6 
billion. These securities have been issued monthly since 
October, following issues in December 1992 and last March. This 
year, roughly two times as many such T-bills have been sold as 
in October-December last year, even though the state bonds, 
which ensure investment allowances, represent increasing 
competition. The new interest paying T-bill series, issued 
monthly since October last year, have been sold at face value at 
an interest rate of 23 percent, but no interest is paid in the 
case of premature redemption. Of the public T-bills sold by the 
Ministry of Finance, two series have been issued. From the 
first (1993/I), HUF8.42 billion worth were sold between August 
23 and November 31, and HUF6.709 billion worth were still 
outstanding at the end of March. These bear an annual interest 
of 19 percent, and can be redeemed with 10 percent after two 
months, 11 percent from the 181st day, 13 percent from the 270th 
day, and 15 percent thereafter. The second public T-bill series 
has been for sale since November 1 last year and February 10 
figures showed the stock standing at HUF7.431 billion. This 
series pays an annual interest of 21 percent, and redemption 
rates 1 percentage point higher than for the 1993/I series.

  R&amp;D PACT WITH IRELAND: The Irish Minister of Enterprise 
and 
Employment Ruairi Quinn and Minister Without Portfolio Erno 
Pungor signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation in research 
and development. The two countries will deepen research and 
development links in biotechnology, agriculture, food 
processing, computer software, telecommunications, and energy 
management. They will hold joint seminars, and exchange 
experts. The Irish minister said his country supported Hungary's 
attempts for a more intensive role in European Union science, 
research, and technology programs such as the Eureka and Cost 
projects. (Budapest MTI in English 1446 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
  TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SLOVENIA: Trade with Slovenia will be 
fully exempted from customs duties in seven years, as set down 
in a bilateral agreement signed by Hungarian and Minister of 
Foreign Economic Relations Bela Kadar and his Slovenian 
counterpart Davorin Kracun. Under the agreement, customs levies 
are to be dismantled in three phases. The first group includes 
goods from all categories, which will be immediately freed from 
tariffs. The medium and long-term lists cover sensitive 
products from the viewpoint of industry protection. In January 
1995, the tariffs of all goods on the medium-term list will be 
reduced to two-thirds, and a year later to one-third of the 
present rate, with complete lifting in 1997. Long-term list 
tariffs will be gradually dismantled, with an annual 15 percent 
reduction from 1995 to 2001. This list is mainly comprised of 
textiles, ready-made clothes, metallurgical products, and 
vehicles. (Budapest MTI in English 1219 GMT 6 Apr 94) 
  FEBRUARY EARNINGS: Average gross monthly earnings in 
businesses with more than 10 workers were 27,819 forints (HUF) 
in February this year. Manual workers earned HUF21,442 a month 
on average, and white-collar workers HUF41,816, the Central 
Statistical Office reports. Average earnings were highest -- 
HUF52,379 -- in the financial sector. The minimum monthly wage 
was raised to HUF10,500 from HUF9,000. Income tax is levied on 
gross earnings and never exceeds 44 percent. Contributions to 
the health and pension insurance schemes and the unemployment 
fund are deductible. On average net earnings are 50 to 70 
percent of the gross figure. (Budapest MTI in English 1301 GMT

  GAS PIPELINES: In 1994 Hungary expects to use 10 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas, half imported from Russia. Since 
increasing imports make it essential for Hungary to diversify 
its sources of supply, the country plans to construct a 140-km 
gas pipeline between Gyor and Baumgarten in eastern Austria. 
With an annual capacity of 4.5 billion cubic meters, the 
pipeline will be the first to connect Hungary with the Western 
European gas network. The project is expected to cost HUF25 
billion, or $245 million. Strong reliance on continuous energy 
supplies makes the Hungarian economy particularly vulnerable. In 
1993 the country imported 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 
almost 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas -- exclusively from 
the former Soviet Union. At the same time, it consumed 6.5 
million tonnes of crude oil and over 9.5 billion cubic meters of 
gas. This year Hungary will import 2.8 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas from Orenburg and 2 billion cubic meters from 
Yamburg, through two branches of the Brotherhood pipeline. The 
total length of Hungary's high-pressure gas network is 4,800 km. 
Diversification of energy imports is all the more important 
because Hungary's gas consumption is expected to sharply 
increase and, because of cheaper imports, the country's energy 
program cannot count on an increase in energy production. Since 
1989 local authorities in the underdeveloped regions have 
invested over HUF10 billion in expanding the gas network, and 
the central budget has contributed HUF4.5 billion to the 
project. As a result, hundreds of thousands of new consumers 
have been provided with natural gas, bringing their total number 
to 2 million. By 1996, local authorities are to invest another 
HUF20 billion, and the central government HUF5 billion, in gas 
pipeline construction, so as to integrate hundreds of thousands 
of more homes into the network. The first step to diversify gas 
purchases and deliveries was a contract signed in Vienna in 
mid-February by Austria's State Mineral Oil Company (OVG-AG) and 
the Hungarian Oil and Gas (MOL) Rt on the construction of the 
Gyor-Baumgarten pipeline under a Hungarian Government guarantee. 
The construction of the $245 million project started in March 
and is to be completed by October 1996. Three- fifths of the 
costs are to be borne by the Austrian side. If all goes 
according to plan, Hungary will receive 3 billion cubic meters 
and Austria the rest through the pipeline. In late January, MOL 
signed a contract with the Essen-based Ruhrgas company, which 
will supply Russian gas to be purchased by West European 
companies. Since the Baumgarten pump station in Lower Austria is 
directly linked to the European network, Hungary will thus have 
access to west and south European sources. In another 
development, Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Slovakia, and Slovenia plan to construct a gas pipeline between 
Krk, Croatia, and Vienna. The feasibility study for the project 
is being prepared. The new pipeline will only be used to 
capacity in case of emergency, as Hungary's long-term energy 
policy scheme gives priority to buying energy resources from the 
former Soviet region. In the spirit of this endeavor, both 
sides have launched talks on prolonging contracts for gas 
deliveries from Yamburg and Orenburg. (Budapest MTI in English

  FARM SUBSIDIES BELOW AVERAGE: The Producers' Subsidy 
Equivalent (PSE), which is the ratio of agricultural subsidies 
to producer prices, was 5 percent in Hungary in 1992, according 
to a report by the Agricultural Research and Information 
Institute. The indicator includes indirect subsidies based on 
the difference between prices on the domestic and foreign 
markets. The indicator for OECD countries was between 3 percent 
and 77 percent for 1992. According to the report, the subsidy 
per hectare was HUF2,627 in 1992. In OECD countries the average 
subsidy was HUF37,000 calculated at the official U.S. dollar-HUF 
exchange rate. The subsidy per agricultural producer was 
HUF24,000 compared with an OECD average of HUF800,000. The 
Consumers' Subsidy Equivalent (CSE), which is the ratio of 
consumers' subsidy to producer prices, was minus 3 percent in 
1992. This means consumers contributed 3 percent of the subsidy 
on farm gate prices. The indicator for OECD countries was 
between minus 2 percent and minus 67 percent. The per capita 
consumer's contribution to agricultural subsidies was HUF590 in 
1992, compared with an OECD average of HUF13,500. While in OECD 
countries the PSE indicator fell by 2.13 percent per annum 
between 1987 and 1992, it decreased by 34.1 percent a year in 
Hungary for the same period. Researchers say that the critical 
situation of agriculture, including its lack of profitability 
and the establishment of privately owned farms, require an 
increase in the level of agricultural subsidies. (Budapest MTI

  FOTEX STOCK ISSUE: The FOTEX is to end the biggest East 
European capital raising maneuver on 18 April. Some 50 percent 
of the $100 million new issue is expected to be sold in the 
United States and the rest in Europe. The 20 million FOTEX 
shares to be issued will be have to be paid for on 19 April and 
trading will begin on 21 April at the Budapest and Vienna stock 
markets, on the pink sheet of the New York NASDAQ, and in 
London, Frankfurt, and Munich. (Budapest MAGYAR NEMZET in

  CURBS ON HEAVY TRAFFIC: Nationwide restrictions on heavy 
traffic for weekends all year round and seven days a week for 
the summer period will not come into effect before next summer 
at the earliest. This year's restrictions will only affect the 
Lake Balaton area, particularly Highway 7 along the southern 
coast and Highway 71 along the northern coast. Trucks weighing 
over 12 tonnes will have to use signposted alternative routes 
between June 15 and September 10 and from Friday midnight to 
Sunday midnight. The extension of the ban to the whole of 
Hungary is also hindered by a lack of truck parking facilities, 
with only one Hungarian border able to cope with large numbers. 
For the time being, the ministry cannot finance developing safe 
lorry parking areas with social amenities. (Budapest MTI in

  BOND ISSUE IN ITALY: In keeping with the strategic aim of 
establishing a presence on all major international money 
markets, the Hungarian National Bank (MNB) is planning to issue 
bonds in Italy in the amount of 150-200 billion lira. According 
to MNB Deputy Chairman Frigyes Harshegyi, the idea has drawn a 
favorable response in Italy. The MNB is presently able to raise 
loans by issuing bonds on 10 major international money markets. 
Half of the bank's credit stock, worth approximately $11 
billion, came about by this method. A date has not been set for 
the MNB bond issue. (Budapest MTI in English 1321 GMT 14 Apr 94) 
  BASE, REPO RATES: At its recent meeting, the Central Bank 
Council decided to leave the central base rate at 22 percent. 
However, an increase in repo rates cannot be ruled out. The 
view of the MNB is that it should not pump liquidity into the 
economy, despite the liquidity shortage on the interbank market. 
Cash-flow figures on the balance of payments and foreign trade 
still show no improvement, which indicates surplus income 
outflow that is reflected in a deterioration of the balance of 
payments instead of a rise in inflation. Part of the surplus 
income, however, does not stay in the banking system long or 
does not enter it at all. The huge financing requirements of 
the central budget and public finances in general still play a 
dominant role on the money and capital markets. However, 
government securities can now be sold, if not necessarily at the 
time of issue, as they bear an interest rate above inflation. 
The central budget's liquid assets have fallen significantly 
from their high level at the end of 1993, but the central bank 
has given no other type of financing to the central budget in 
the first quarter of this year. Although the central bank is 
obliged to buy unsold, newly issued bonds under the 1994 Budget 
Law, it has had no difficulty in selling them. As a result, the 
MNB's 1994 80-billion forint (HUF) budget financing obligation 
has not been used so far. Because the government is 
increasingly selling its securities directly to the public or to 
companies, the money does not stay with the banking system. The 
high level of demand for imports is another reason for the 
forint shortage on the interbank market. Commissions to banks 
paid by companies on foreign exchange purchases for imports have 
caused a forint shortage, which may be strengthened by 
speculation on devaluation of the forint. Inflation and 
personal income figures show real incomes increasing in the 
first quarter of 1994. In addition to public sector pay rises, 
net wages have risen as a result in changes in the personal 
income tax system. Hence, a significant part of the import 
demand is likely to be for consumption. Such imports 
deteriorate the external balances without providing any basis 
for producing more export goods. As a result, the external and 
internal imbalances in the economy cannot be cured through 
monetary means alone. In addition to a tight monetary policy 
and an interest rate policy designed to encourage saving, budget 
restrictions are also necessary, but can only be expected after 
the May general elections, the MNB states. The MNB decided to 
increase repo interest rates at the end of March mainly to avoid 
"reopening the repo-tap," as well as to dampen banks and their 
clients' devaluation expectations by making financing more 
expensive. In the months following September 1993, the central 
bank had no choice but to leave the repo facility open at an 
increased interest level in order to help finance the budget, 
which was in difficulty as a result of decreasing savings. Repo 
channels closed in December as the average yield of government 
securities increased. In the week of the March repo-rate 
increase, the average yields of 30 and 90-day discount treasury 
bills again came close to the cost of repo loans of similar 
maturities. The central bank wants to avoid releasing surplus 
liquidity by again making it profitable for banks to finance 
discount treasury bill purchases from repo loans -- that is, to 
allow central bank money to flow out through the repo channels 
to banks, the central budget, and then on. The central bank 
should attempt to improve the external balances through 
regulating liquidity in accordance with its 1994 monetary policy 
guidelines, the MNB Council decided. The central bank intends 
to neutralize the effects of cuts in the compulsory reserve rate 
by introducing reverse (passive) repo auctions in the near 
future. The 1-percent reduction in the compulsory reserve rate 
in March resulted in a HUF9 billion relative surplus liquidity. 
A rise in the interest rates on repo loans cannot be excluded 
if the need arises, an MNB official said, adding "I would like 
to draw attention to the fact that continuously increasing 
deposit interest rates, which stimulate savings, may make it 
possible that lending and money market rates will not reflect 
changes in repo rates." Most members of the Central Bank 
Council felt that there was no justification for an increase in 
the central bank base rate, which indicates their belief that 
inflation could fall. (Budapest MTI in English 1515 GMT 15 Apr

  NO MNB RESCHEDULING: Hungary will remain adherent to the 
policy of servicing foreign debts on schedule, MNB Chairman Akos 
Peter Bod said. He was responding to political party views that 
Hungary should follow Poland in rescheduling foreign debts. 
According to Bod, Hungary is in no position to ask for 
rescheduling because its large hard-currency reserves allow for 
due payment of interest and repayment on capital loans. As a 
result of the MNB's debt-management practice, much of the former 
short-term credits could be replaced by loans of longer 
maturity. Capital inflow has gathered speed recently, providing 
resources for economic transformation. Preliminary calculations 
show a major balance-of- payments deficit for January, but 
inflation is under control and consumer prices are not expected 
to rise by more than 18 percent this year. Major changes in the 
structure of foreign debts were reported. The stock of MNB's 
foreign debts has not increased in recent years. The 
indebtedness level of Hungary's commercial banks and companies 
is stabilizing, indicating that some of the foreign resources 
financed the projects that will facilitate export increases in 
the future. (Budapest MTI in English 1527 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  SHARE PURCHASE SCHEME: On 18 April, 501,806 shares paying 
the normal plus 1-percent dividend of Sopron Brewery will be 
offered through the Preferential Share Purchase Program (PSPP), 
formerly known as the Small Investor Share Purchase Program. 
Sopron Brewery has registered capital of HUF1.352 billion. Any 
Hungarian over 18 who is a resident of Hungary is eligible to 
purchase state property up to a face value of HUF100,000 through 
an interest-free, five-year loan from the state. The PSPP also 
allows repayment of the loan through compensation coupons. Of 
the 501,807 shares currently owned by the State Property Agency 
(AVU), 300,000 shares are being offered through the PSPP. If 
the shares are exchanged for compensation coupons (CC), the rate 
is 10 CCs with a face value of HUF1,000 each for four shares. 
Through the program, small investors can purchase either five 
or 10 Sopron Brewery shares if the loan is repaid in cash. A 
total of 16 shares can be registered for CCs. The AVU offered 
201,806 for cash. Hungarian individuals are eligible for 30,000 
of those shares, while the remainder is targeted at 
institutional investors. The issue price in both the PSPP and 
the cash offer is HUF3,800 (380 percent face value). The packet 
offered by the AVU consists of preference shares, granting a 
one-third voting right. The majority owner of Sopron Brewery is 
the Austrian Brau Union, holding a 76.48-percent voting right 
and a 51.3 percent stake. Sopron Brewery plans a net sales 
turnover of HUF3.275 billion this year, as compared to HUF2.727 
billion in 1993. The company continues to enjoy a 100- percent 
tax exemption this year, as a result of which its profit is 
predicted at HUF597 million in 1994, as opposed to HUF530 
million last year. (Budapest MTI in English 1229 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  FOOD INDUSTRY PRIVATIZATION: Foreign capital of almost $2 
billion has arrived in Hungary through the privatization of food 
companies and interest among domestic and foreign investors is 
still high. Foreign companies have also invested $600-700 
million in food companies and a further $400 million is expected 
to be invested in development. The privatization of vegetable 
oil, confectionery, tobacco, and sugar industries has been 
completed. Tenders have been invited for the sale of almost all 
of Hungary's grain and dairy companies, but the privatization of 
meat companies is lagging behind. Even following new 
investment, the meat industry will not be as large as it was. 
The livestock population has fallen considerably in recent 
years and the 1,000 recently established small slaughterhouses 
and meat processing plants have undercut the prices of the older 
meat complexes. As a result of surplus capacity and the general 
lack of working capital, at least three large meat comapanies 
will have to be closed down next year. Although no final 
decision has been made, it is thought that meat processing 
companies in Szekszard, Pest-Nograd, and Miskolc are the most 
likely candidates. Following consolidation, Hungary's grain 
companies are now operating profitably and the involvement of 
foreign capital is not seen as essential. It is thus planned 
that the majority of these companies will be sold to local 
investors or small investors through the Budapest Stock 
Exchange. (Budapest MTI in English 1621 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  TRADE TALKS WITH SLOVAKIA: Amidst an overall decline in 
exports by both countries, trade turnover with Slovakia has 
increased markedly. Slovak and Hungarian ministry officials 
exchanged views on accelerating the implementation of the free 
trade agreement between the Visegrad countries in order to clear 
the way for an agreement aimed at further trade liberalization 
to be signed in the near future. In 1993, trade between the two 
countries amounted to more than $365 million: Hungarian exports 
to Slovakia were valued at $128 million and Slovak exports to 
Hungary, $237 million. Slovakia is fifth on the list of 
Hungary's trading partners. The growing list of joint ventures, 
including the more than 350 firms in Slovakia with Hungarian 
interests, figure prominently in these results. The value of 
Hungarian capital invested in Slovakia is about $2 million.

  CR ECONOMIC TIES DISCUSSED: Business links between Hungary 
and the Czech Republic (CR) were the subject of talks between 
Hungarian and Czech ministry officials. The negotiating 
partners were satisfied with the development of bilateral trade, 
which last year totalled $433 million. Hungarian exports were 
worth $169 million, with imports at $264 million. To date, 
nearly 120 Hungarian joint ventures and representations have 
been registered in the Czech Republic, with a total capital of 
$1 billion. Both sides to the talks expressed the intention to 
renew the legal and economic conditions for bilateral business 
ties. (Budapest MTI in English 1328 GMT 15 Apr 94) 
  COST OF LIVING: The Central Statistical Office estimates 
that a two-parent family with two children living in Budapest 
required a monthly net income of HUF50,600 in March to maintain 
an acceptable standard of living. The figure is HUF500 more than 
the amount required in February. The figure was HUF50,100 in 
February and HUF49,400 in January this year. The national 
average per capita figure needed was 12,650 in March, HUF120 
more than in the previous month. Those who are of working age 
and live alone in cities needed the highest per capita income 
HUF17,700, while a family with four children living in the 
country required the lowest per capita income of HUF9,980.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS: The growth in personal foreign 
currency savings slowed dramatically in March. Hungarian 
National Bank (MNB) figures show that new deposits exceeded 
withdrawals by only 800 million forints (HUF) in March. The 
total value of personal foreign currency deposits increased by 
HUF15.1 billion in the first quarter of the year. The amount 
held in personal foreign exchange deposit accounts was 
HUF219.740 billion (slightly over $2 billion) at the end of 
March. New deposits totalled HUF30 billion in March and HUF29.2 
billion was withdrawn. (Budapest MTI in English 1546 GMT 21 Apr

  EXPORTS INCREASE: The economy is showing signs of an upward 
trend that could be termed as a modest recovery. The first 
three months saw exports amounting to $2.15 billion, 4.1 percent 
more than in the same period last year. Imports totalled $2.91 
billion, 9.2 percent more than a year ago. Customs statistics 
show a $757 million deficit in the foreign trade balance for 
this period. Two thirds of Hungary's exports went to Germany, 
the successor states of the Soviet Union, Austria, Italy, and 
the United States. In the same period, direct foreign 
investment exceeded $300 million, somewhat less than in the 
first quarter of last year. (Budapest MTI in English 1037 GMT

account, the country's balance of payments showed a $853 million 
surplus. The trade balance showed a deficit of $389 million in 
January, with exports amounting to $605 million and imports 
totalling $994 million. In December, exports amounted to $747 
million and imports totalled $1,047.7 million, resulting in a 
deficit of $300.7 million. Direct foreign cash investment 
amounted to $88 million in January, while long-term capital 
inflow was $1,476 million. International reserves stood at 
$7,539.2 million at the end of January, compared with $6,736.2 
million at the end of last year. Total direct cash investment 
amounted to $5,661.6 million at the end of January, up from 
$5,575.9 million at the end of December, 1993. Foreign debt 
totalled $25,698.8 million at the end of January as against

  VACCINE TESTING FACILITY: The veterinary vaccine 
manufacturing company, Phylaxia-Sanofi Oltoanyagtermelo Rt, 
officially opened a HUF60 million animal testing facility on the 
site of the company's headquarters in Budapest on 21 April. 
With the opening of the new facility, the company had brought 
production of veterinary vaccines up to internationally accepted 
standards. He said that since the company was established in 
1991, a total of HUF667 million had been invested in order to 
improve and control quality. This includes the HUF184 million 
which is expected to be spent this year. Phylaxia-Sanofi Rt is 
the only company in Hungary which produces veterinary vaccines. 
Half of the French company Sanofi's veterinary vaccines are 
manufactured in the Budapest factory. Sanofi Sante Nutrition 
Animale currently holds 36 percent of Phylaxia-Sanofi, the 
Hungarian company Chinoin Pharmaceuticals 15 percent, and the 
Austrian company, CA Hungary Investment, 49 percent. The 
registered capital has remained at HUF900 million, with the 
company having a shareholders' equity of HUF1.028 billion at the 
end of last year. Phylaxia-Sanofi has a 25 percent share of the 
HUF2.5 billion domestic market for veterinary products and a 
50-percent share of the market for veterinary vaccines. While 
the company is also involved in distributing veterinary 
products, 70 percent of turnover is from sales of the company's 
own products. (Budapest MTI in English 1543 GMT 21 Apr 94) 
  CORPORATE FOREIGN DEBT: The net direct foreign debts of 
Hungarian companies stood at $1.871 billion at the end of March, 
Hungarian National Bank (MNB) figures show. At the end of 1993, 
the corresponding figure was $1.825 billion. In the first 
quarter, Hungarian companies took out foreign loans totalling 
$261 million and repayments totalled $215 million. At the end 
of March, the total amount of foreign credit was $2.777 billion, 
of which $906 million had been repaid. Hungarian companies owed 
$408 million to foreign joint venture partners or parent 
companies. Of the net total debt at the end of March, loans of 
less than one year maturity accounted for $566 million as 
compared to $1.305 billion in longer term loans. (Budapest MTI

  OTP SHARES APPLICATIONS: Applications for HUF8.83 billion 
worth of shares in the OTP Bank had been submitted by the close 
of subscription on 22 April. The demand for exchanging 
compensation coupons for shares was so great that the State 
Holding Company (AV Rt) doubled the original amount of shares 
offered, from HUF2.3 billion to HUF4.6 billion. The original 
recipients of compensation coupons submitted applications for 
HUF7.879 billion worth of shares. OTP manages the subscription. 
Only the original recipients of compensation coupons are to 
receive shares in the allocation, which will be carried out by a 
"card dealing" method, with shares to be "dealt" to subscribers 
until the supply is exhausted. A total of 60,000 people applied 
for shares. The exchange rate was three OTP shares for two 
compensation coupons. An estimated 40-45 percent of the shares 
are to be repurchased by OTP Broker at 70 percent of the value. 
The shares offered in OTP represent a 20 percent stake in the 
bank's registered capital. (Budapest MTI in English 1009 GMT 26 
Apr 94) 
  INCREASED STATE OTP EQUITY: The state will raise the 
registered capital of the savings bank OTP Rt to HUF28 billion 
by contributing HUF5 billion worth at par consolidation state 
bonds. As a result, the state-owned stake will grow from 75 
percent to almost 80 percent. The capital injection is 
necessary to carry out modernization, including the installation 
of an integrated computer network. If the bank's warranty 
capital is not raised, it will exceed the investment limit fixed 
by the banking law which states that the bank's total investment 
in real estate, movables and securities cannot exceed the 
warranty capital. As a result of this the bank's warranty 
capital will be HUF41 billion, HUF28 billion of which will be 
registered capital, HUF5 billion reserves and HUF5 billion the 
subordinated loan. The state granted the subordinated loan in 
December, under the bank consolidation scheme. At the same 
time, the bank subscribed HUF5 billion worth at par of credit 
consolidation state bonds, bearing identical conditions with the 
loan. OTP will hold its general meeting on April 28. The 
balance sheet total in 1993 was HUF830.9 billion, 10.1 percent 
up from the previous year. Pre-tax profits were HUF1.18 billion 
(HUF1.9 billion in 1992). The profits before risk provision was 
HUF13 billion. The bank filled its risk provision to 100 
percent, while its capital adequacy ratio was 15 percent 
according to Hungarian accounting standards. International 
accounting will result in a slightly lower figure. (Budapest 
MTI in English 1757 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  RISE IN ENTERPRISES: In the first quarter of 1994, the 
number of enterprises in Hungary continued to grow. According 
to the Central Statistical Office (KSH), 1,595 start-up ventures 
were registered in the country during the month of January. 
This number rose to 1,846 in February and declined slightly in 
March, to 1,258. Over the same period, 477 enterprises ceased 
to exist, 39 were liquidated, 144 ceased business, and 294 were 
restructured. As a result, at the end of the first three 
months, there were 89,860 economic units acting in the country 
as legal entities -- 5 percent more than at the end of last 
year. 10 percent of the start-ups were cooperatives; 1 percent 
were companies. 35 percent of these enterprises specialized in 
commerce or the service sector, and 20 percent in industry. At 
the end of March 1994, the number of private entrepreneurs was 
709,310 -- 3 percent more than at the beginning of the year. Of 
these 35 percent were artisans, 35 percent retailers, 28 percent 
professionals, and 2 percent farmers. As many as 99.8 percent 
of the self-employed work alone or with only a few assistants, 
KSH data show. (Budapest MTI in English 1001 GMT 26 Apr 94)

  KERM RECOMMENDS LAWS: The Council of Ministers' Economic 
Commission (KERM) made a decision to recommend to the government 
the following draft laws: concerning the sugar market's 
regulation and ownership transformations in the sugar industry; 
concerning amendments to the maritime code; concerning a law on 
insurance for export contracts; and concerning a law on tasks 
referred over to gminas (small administrative units) associated 
with organizing and implementing agricultural reports. If the 
draft laws become effective, the price of sugar may rise by 7 
percent, shipyards will find it easier to finance shipbuilding, 
while exporters will find it easier to export merchandise to the 
countries of the former COMECON. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA 
(Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 28 March 94 p 8) 
  THERMAL ENERGY PRICES: Effective 1 April, prices of thermal 
energy supplied to households will increase by 20 percent. 
According to some calculations, a four-member family living in 
a 60 square meters household will pay 161,200 zlotys more for 
thermal energy in April than in March. Subsequent price 
increases have been planned for: 1 July (by 15 percent), and 1 
October (by 20 percent). (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I 
Rynek Supplement) in Polish 29 Mar 94 p 7) 
  POPULAR PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM: The Ownership Transformations 
Ministry informed during a press conference that the Popular 
Privatization Program currently covers 367 enterprises and 
companies, with a list of another 110 enterprises being prepared 
and to be debated by the Council of Ministers' Economic 
Commission after Easter. Six enterprises are on the list of 
units excluded from the program. The program is of an open 
nature so it will be possible to include more companies in it, 
or -- if the program is successful -- repeat it in the future. 
(Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 
30 Mar 94 p 7) 
  TIRE FACTORY REPORT: The Olsztyn-based Stomil SA Tire 
Factory 
achieved the kind of economic results last year which are a good 
indicator for the company's future. The company's net profit 
was over 240 billion zlotys whereas the average salary among the 
3,400-person employee crew was 6.2 million zlotys per month. 
The company exports 25 percent of its products to 10 countries 
around the world and it has invested $30 million in 
redevelopment and modernization of production of supplementary 
types of tires (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek 
Supplement) in Polish 30 Mar 94 p 9) 
  SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES: According to Deputy Industry and 
Trade Minister Edward Nowak, during its session on 30 March, the 
Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) accepted 
the idea of establishing economic zones in line with the concept 
of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. A special team will 
prepare the final bill by 15 April. The special economic zones 
are supposed to be established particularly in regions 
characterized by high unemployment and by economic potential 
that is not being used (Mielec). KERM recommends that such 
zones also be established in areas close to the state's borders. 
Among other things, the bill will ensure maximum tax allowances 
and exemptions for companies which set up business there. This 
solution would be initially treated as an experiment and only 
three or four zones would be established within the next two or 
three years (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) 
in Polish 31 Mar p 5) 
  EXPORTS DECREASING: According to Professor Urszula Plowiec, 
the balance sheet of the economic policies of the consecutive 
governments from 1989 is positive because it resulted in a rapid 
economic growth, overcoming the recession, curbing inflation, 
and stabilizing the unemployment level; however, all this 
occurred at the cost of the development of exports. The authors 
of the report believe that the fact that the share of exports in 
the Polish Gross Domestic Product in recent years has been on 
the wane results first of all from one fact: the Polish economy 
was not adjusted to the requirements of foreign markets and 
could not be changed before the economy was stabilized. Contrary 
to optimistic forecasts by the government, this trend will be 
maintained this year as well. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia 
I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 31 Mar p 5) 
  MINISTER RETURNS FROM CHINA: Transportation Minister 
Boguslaw 
Liberadzki returned from a trip to China where he was heading a 
Polish delegation. The seventh session of a Polish-Chinese 
governmental commission resulted in an announcement that the 
trade ties between the two countries in the year 2000 should 
reach the level from 1986, that is over $1 billion. The current 
negative trade balance will be eliminated by the end of 1994. 
The Chinese owe Poland several dozen million Swiss francs which 
they will pay back by supplying merchandise (Warsaw GAZETA 
WYBORCZA in Polish 2-4 April 94 p 21) 
  BANK STOCKBROKERING PROFIT: In 1993, Bank Zachodni SA 
reached 
a profit of 18 billion zlotys on its stockbrokering activities 
for the first time. The amount constitutes 2 percent of the 
entire profit earned by the bank last year. This year, the bank 
will make 30 billion zlotys worth of investments in order to 
develop its stockbrokering services. The money will be spent 
primarily on increasing the volume of technical equipment 
(communications, computer network) and also on extending the 
premises to cover additional sites. Currently, the bank has 60 
branches throughout Poland but just 23 stockbrokering services 
units (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 5 April 94 p 17) 
  FINANCIAL MOOD IMPROVING: The Main Commercial School's 
Institute for Economic Development reports in its most recent 
survey that optimism among Polish families regarding their 
financial situation and moods, is clearly increasing. The 
number of families whose situation did not deteriorate in the 
last three months, is also on the increase. Polish families are 
still mostly concerned with the big impact of price increases on 
their situation, despite the fact that according to data by the 
Main Statistical Office, price increases this year have been 
much slower than last year. For the first time in many months, 
a substantial portion of families reported an improvement in the 
level of consumption of food products. The increase of optimism 
was as much as over 10 percentage points compared with the 
previous quarter. Factors shaping the situation of family 
households are considered to be mainly associated with income 
levels, savings levels, and optimism level with regard to the 
future (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 5 April 94 p 14) 
  MARCH ECONOMIC INDICATORS: The indicator of the country's 
economic situation increased by 2 percentage points in March 
compared with February. It seems that trends of an economic 
growth are becoming stable, as demonstrated by an increase in 
both domestic and export-bound orders, an increase in the 
productivity indicator (including with regard to export-bound 
production), a fall in the reserves of ready-made products, and 
also a decrease in the rate of price increases. (Warsaw 
RZECZPOSPOLITA (Ekonomia I Rynek Supplement) in Polish 6 Apr 94 
p 7 ) 
  PRICES INCREASES SLOW: According to the Finance Ministry, 
prices on merchandise and services increased by 1.6 percent in 
March. Food prices increased by 1.4 percent, alcohol prices -- 
by 4.4 percent, and prices on services -- by 1.7 percent. The 
ministry predicts that throughout April, prices on consumption 
items will increase by 2.1 percent even despite the fact that 
this year's budget contained a 2.3-percent increase. (Warsaw 
GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 17) 
  PHONE EMPLOYEES RAISES: Employees of "Telekomunikacja Polska 
SA" will receive 1.345 million- per-person raises before the end 
of the year. This will cost the company about 1 trillion 
zlotys. The first installment will take effect as soon as 
April. The company's spokesman denied allegations by Sejm 
Deputy Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party, that the raises 
will be implemented at the cost of investment expenditures. 
(Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 8 Apr 94 p 17) 
  HIGHWAY COMMISSION SESSION: A working inter-ministry group 
for highway construction has held its first session. Individual 
ministers and local governors have quite a lot of comments on a 
draft law which is to be debated by the government in May and by 
the Sejm in June. The program envisages construction of about 
2,600 kilometers of highways by the year 2007. In order to 
implement the program, apart from money, appropriate legislative 
acts are also needed which would regulate the construction works 
and the subsequent usage of the highways. With that goal in 
mind, the Council of Minister's Economic Committee established 
an inter-ministry group at the end of January, whose task is to 
come up with all the necessary legal provisions. (Warsaw ZYCIE 
WARSZAWY in Polish 8 Apr p 10) 
  CHANGES IN ECONOMIC POLICIES: During a meeting at the 
American Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Trade Minister Marek 
Pol announced a widening of the scale of state interventionist 
policies. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was an 
unofficial guest during the meeting. The minister's speech at 
the Chamber is widely perceived as very important as a majority 
of those present took it to be a sign of changes to come in 
Polish economic policies. Minister Pol said that the branches 
where restructuring will take place the soonest, are the 
shipyard industry, steel works, the energy, fuel, and defense 
industries. Plans for restructuring these ministries have 
already been prepared. Minister Pol noted that the state will 
only deal with the restructuring of the most important branches 
while the others will have to find their own best ways for the 
future. American businessmen were informed that the Polish 
Government will not hesitate to introduce protectionist 
measures, especially in those branches which will be subjected 
to the restructuring process. Pol also said that he can see no 
obstacles for foreign investors in Poland and he described the 
requirement of prior Internal Affairs Ministry approval for 
purchasing land in Poland -- which has been criticized by 
American businessmen -- as a "normal procedure and also a 
protection for the state against awkward situations." (Warsaw 
ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 13 Apr 94 p 11) 
  PETROBALTIC OIL CONCESSION: Based on an agreement signed on 
13 April in Gdansk with the Environmental Protection, Natural 
Resources, and Forestry Ministry, the "Petrobaltic" company was 
granted a concession to excavate oil from the undersea B-3 pool 
which is located approximately 70 km north of Rozewie. The 
pool's capabilities will make it possible to conduct oil 
excavation for a period of 12 years, with an efficiency rate of 
500,000 tons per year -- this according to Jan Kurek, 
"Petrobaltic"s manager. The company is not just interested in 
the Polish shelf. Currently, it is the only oil company in the 
Baltic Sea which has the right equipment, experience, and 
personnel to conduct oil exploration and excavation. Talks are 
in progress regarding "Petrobaltic"s possible involvement at a 
site near Kaliningrad. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 14 Apr 94 
p 3) 
  TRADE WITH CROATIA: Croatian Economy Minister Nadan 
Vidosevic 
paid a visit to Warsaw where he stated that despite low levels 
of trade exchange with Poland up to now, the situation is 
getting back to normal. Vidosevic said that one can travel and 
conduct business without any fear on about 75 percent of 
Croatian territory, with trade restrictions being in effect only 
in those regions of Croatia which are supervised by UN troops. 
During the Warsaw talks, both sides agreed that there are 
possibilities of increasing trade ties between the two countries 
in areas like the tourist, textile, agricultural food, 
electrotechnical, chemical, and petrochemical industries. Four 
years ago, Croatia occupied the second place among the Yugoslav 
republics, on the list of countries involved in trade exchange 
with Poland. In 1993, the volume of exchange between the two 
countries fell by 30 percent compared with 1990. (Warsaw NOWA 
EUROPA in Polish 8-10 Apr 94 p 4) 
  ENVIRONMENT PACT WITH GERMANY: Polish and German Ministers 
Stanislaw Zelichowski and Klaus Topfer signed an agreement in 
Schwerin concerning cooperation in environmental protection. 
Both sides will be exchanging information concerning the 
location of environment-sensitive investments in the border 
area. Minister Zelichowski said promises contained in the 
German unification treaty concerning adaptation of East German 
power stations to European Union standards by July 1996, will 
not be met. Germany intends to build two new power stations in 
the vicinity of the border with Poland. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY 
in Polish 9-10 Apr 94 p 10) 
  AGENCY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: ARG is a partnership which 
is entirely owned by the Treasury. On 16 March the state 
contributed 4.567 trillion zlotys to ARG -- in the form of 
shares of Universal (2,628,000), Export Development Bank (BRE) 
(270,000 shares), and Elektrim (1,080,000); the agency will have 
to pay dividends to the Treasury. In the future, the main 
source of income for ARG will be economic activity (the 
government will not give the agency any budget money). The 
partnership is going to participate in undertakings requiring 
the investment of substantial capital (construction of highways, 
development of border-area infrastructure, restructurization of 
the shipyard industry, or construction of the transit gas 
pipeline running through Poland). In line with the economic 
strategy adopted by the government, ARG intends to focus its 
activity on the promotion of Polish exports. The company wants 
to wage advertising-promotion campaigns and support small 
private firms on foreign markets, and share profits with them. 
(RZECZPOSPOLITA, 12 Mar 94 p 7) 
  MARCH PRODUCTION: Production rose by 16.6 per cent in March 
as compared with February and it was higher by 12.3 per cent 
than in 1993, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said on 
Monday. Also, building and assembly enterprises obtained better 
results in March 1994 than in the previous month, with their 
output rising by 15.6 per cent throughout last March. The 
greatest production growth, by 19.4 per cent, was achieved last 
March by a group of factories manufacturing food, clothes, 
timber, paper and metal products, machines and installations as 
well as furniture, medical tools and radio and tv sets. 
Comparing results in March 1994 with 1993, production increased 
in enterprises producing food and clothes by 14.8 per cent and 
in plants supplying factories and private customers with water, 
gas and electricity - by 2.2 per cent and in building and 
assembly firms - by 7.6 per cent. In March 1994, mines achieved 
better results than in 1993 by 4.8 per cent. (Warsaw PAP in 
English 1558 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  PARIS CLUB AGREES TO REDUCE DEBT: On Thursday, 14 April, the 
Paris Club finally accepted a 50-percent reduction of the Polish 
debt. This decision resolved the problem of the greatest part 
of the Polish foreign debt, which in 1991 amounted to $33 
billion. Until 2009, Poland will pay approximately $1 billion 
less in annual interest; decreased will also be the amount of 
basic capital. In April 1991, a 30-percent reduction was 
confirmed; on Thursday, an additional 20-percent reduction was 
discussed. This agreement was possible because Poland satisfied 
the conditions made by the Paris Club. Nonetheless, it is 
stressed in the press communique issued after the session that 
the Paris Club reserves the right to change its decision, 
depending on the implementation of the initial agreement with 
the London Club. Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki 
says that such a clause has only theoretical significance. It 
also concerns other conditions of the agreement, that is, 
Poland's continuing with market reforms and meeting its 
obligations. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 1) 
  MARCH INFLATION HIGHER: The Central Office of Statistics 
reported on 15 March that prices of consumer goods and services 
went up in March by an average of 2 percent -- the Finance 
Ministry had estimated the March inflation rate at 1.6 percent. 
In January, the monthly inflation rate was 1.6 percent, in 
February -- 1.1 percent. Prices in March of this year were 30.2 
percent higher that prices in March last year. The consumer 
inflation rate in February was 29.9 percent. The March price 
increase was caused, first of all, by prices of non-food goods, 
which went up by 2.2 percent. The increase in food prices in 
March was lower than the inflation index -- by 1.8 percent. 
Prices for services increased by an average 1.8 percent. It 
was first of all the result of increases in the official prices 
for gas and electricity, which were originally scheduled for 
February but deferred until March. The increase in prices for 
services was limited by the 10-percent decrease in telephone 
prices in March. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar went up 
by 77 zlotys (at the National Bank of Poland) and by 44 zlotys 
at exchange houses. The Finance Ministry predicts that in April 
prices will increase by an average of 2.1 percent, or even less 
because of the deferred increase in gasoline prices. (Warsaw 
RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 1) 
  KERM ACCEPTS PROGRAM: The Economic Committee of the Council 
of Ministers (KERM) 1994-1997 accepted the socioeconomic program 
as prepared by the Central Planning Administration (CUP). KERM 
accepted the main points of economic development included in the 
third basic option, recommended by CUP; state policy is aimed at 
stimulating investment and export activity, and within the next 
three years we will witness high, lasting, and balanced economic 
growth. This option should result in increasing investments, 
exports, and work efficiency, which, in turn, ought to restrict 
unemployment and improve living standards. KERM proposed that 
the Council of Ministers authorize CUP to submit the final 
version of the program by 15 May; the report should take into 
account the proposals of the various ministries as well as 
remarks submitted at the committee's session on Friday, 15 
April. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 5) 
  WAGES INCREASING: Even though in March the popiwek -- tax on 
wage increases -- was still in force, before-tax wages, not 
including dividends paid from company profits, were 8.8 percent 
higher in February, it was reported on 16 April by the Central 
Office of Statistics (GUS). Along with the profit dividends, 
before-tax wages were 14.8-percent higher. The average wage 
before taxes in the enterprise sector was 5,418,500 zlotys 
(along with profits) and 4,993,700 zlotys (without the profit 
dividends and balance surplus). Real wages (without the profit 
dividends) increased in March by at least 6 percent. In 
comparison with March 1993, before-tax wages were higher this 
March by 37.1 percent, without the profit dividends -- by 35.9 
percent. The prices for consumer goods and services increased 
in the same period by 30.2 percent. The data suggest that the 
Finance Ministry's forecast that consumer goods and services 
will increase by only 2.1 percent in April is not very probable. 
(Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 18 Apr pp 1, 5) 
  TOLL ROAD CONSTRUCTION: At the beginning of next year, the 
first licenses will be granted for the construction and 
maintenance of five toll roads which, within a period of 15 
years, will form a 2,571-km network in Poland of modern 
high-speed highways of great domestic and international 
importance -- this according to Andrzej Palatas, director of the 
Polish Highways Agency. Highways mean not just better 
transportation but also improvements in the general economic 
situation and in employment, especially in areas adjacent to 
them. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 15-17 Apr p 4) 
  TOBACCO PRIVATIZATION OBSTACLES: According to Ownership 
Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, privatization of the 
very profitable tobacco industry is made difficult by a need to 
very thoroughly assess the value of the companies involved. 
During a meeting with businessmen at the Krakow Industrial- 
Commercial Chamber, Kaczmarek also said that the process 
includes not just machinery and investment capital, but also a 
large segment of the consumer market. Bogdan Pek, chairman of 
the Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission, announced during 
the meeting that if the ministry officially proposes the sale of 
the tobacco industry, then he will demand that the ministry's 
leadership be dismissed (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 18 Apr p 
3) 
  FOREIGN INVESTMENTS INCREASING: In 1993, foreign capital 
investment in Poland exceeded $3 billion. The amount was lower 
by more than 50 percent from a year ago -- this according to the 
Institute of Foreign Trade Economic Situations and Prices. The 
Americans have invested the most -- around $1 billion, and they 
promise another billion in the future. The Italians occupy 
second place on the list, with about $270 million (they promise 
$970 million). The Germans, Austrians, Dutch, and Belgians are 
also in the top ten. The Japanese are last on the list, with 
about $9 million. This situation is bound to change since 
Matsushita Battery Co. and the Dutch Philips Co. have just 
signed an agreement to construct a battery plant in Gniezno. 
The value of the project is estimated at over $35 million. 
(Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 16-17 Apr p 19) 
  LOT SEEKS PARTNER: For over a year now, Lot Polish Airlines 
has been looking for a strategic partner, which would strengthen 
its position on transatlantic routes and which would help it 
survive competition in the skies. All signs are that an 
alliance will be concluded with one of two big U.S. carriers -- 
Delta, or American Airlines. To this day, it is not known which 
one of them will eventually be LOT's partner, and because of new 
proposals from both U.S. airlines, the talks have continued for 
longer than expected. Transportation Minister Boguslaw 
Liberadzki says that selling part of LOT is out of the question; 
all that is being planned is a close alliance. An alliance with 
a U.S. partner would create opportunities for LOT to increase 
the volume of passengers flown across the Atlantic as well as 
secure access to the huge U.S. market. Right now, LOT has 
regular connections with only New York and Chicago. (Warsaw 
GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 18 Apr p 14) 
  "GRAY ZONE" 20 PERCENT OF GDP: According to an independent 
study released on Monday, April 18, Poland's unaccounted-for 
business activity (also known as the "gray zone") stood at about 
20 percent of official GDP in 1993, producing about 340 trillion 
zlotys ($15 billion) in revenues. The revenue compared with 460 
trillion zlotys ($20.5 billion) in official state budget 
revenues and the GDP of 1,600 trillion zlotys ($71 billion). 
The Main Statistical Office (GUS) and the Polish Academy of 
Sciences (PAN) said the relatively high level of activity in the 
"gray zone" followed rapid political and economic liberalization 
and the accompanying recession since reforms began in 1989. 
"The gray economy...is a normal element of any system, but its 
role increases in times of political transition or economic 
downfall," GUS and PAN have said. The report also said several 
hundred thousand Poles work illegally and that the real number 
of unemployed was considerably lower than the official figure of 
close to 3 million. It is also estimated that illegal imports 
reduced budget revenues by $1 billion a year because of unpaid 
customs duties and taxes. The report also said 30 percent of 
revenue in the "gray zone" was produced by totally unregistered 
activity. The remainder was produced by registered companies 
which did not completely account for their business. (Warsaw 
NOWA EUROPA in English 19 Apr p 24) 
  BUSINESSMEN SUPPORT BUDGET: Businessmen who are members of 
the Business Center Club (BCC) held a meeting on 18 April during 
which they commented on the impact of events of the last few 
months on the economic situation. "In our view, the restrictive 
tax system and the increasing fiscal burdens, cannot be the only 
source of revenue for the state" -- BCC representatives stated. 
Despite these reservations, the businessmen support the budget 
as a compromise solution and they are happy that the president 
decided to sign it. They regard the lack of a deputy prime 
minister for economic affairs and finance minister, as 
unacceptable in a situation where reforms of the tax system and 
a restructuring of enterprises are pending. According to the 
businessmen, it is too soon to abandon popiwek (tax on excessive 
wage increases) at this stage. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in 
Polish 19 Apr p 13) 
  BUTTER EXPORTS: Poland received permission from GATT to 
export 67,000 tons of butter to the countries of the former 
USSR. According to the Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry, 
Poland is entitled to sell this much butter at any price, 
without having to observe GATT minimum prices. The deadline for 
applications to be submitted to the ministry is the end of May, 
while the deadline for exports to be terminated is the end of 
August. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 22 Apr p 17) 
  BALANCE OF PAYMENTS: National Bank of Poland (NBP) reports 
that after two months this year, the deficit of current turnover 
of the payment balance is $107 million. Last year it was over 
three times larger -- $372 million. Only in February, was a 
surplus of $84 million registered in the current turnover, and 
exports exceeded imports by $50 million. According to NBP, 
however, this may be accidental -- the dates of the 
implementation of trade contracts may have coincided and 
therefore, it is too early to say that this trend is lasting. 
In the first two months of 1994, the receipts from exports 
reached the level of $2.127 billion (20.4 percent more than in 
1993); imports of goods, after two months, amounted to $2.227 
billion, and compared to the same period last year, it increased 
by 7.9 percent. Thus, after two months, the deficit of 
commodity payments is $150 million. Compared to last year, the 
geographic structure of the commodity exchange slightly changed: 
the share of the developed countries, both in our exports and 
imports, increased while the share of Central and Eastern Europe 
dropped. The positive balance of services after two months was 
$80 million, and increased significantly in comparison with the 
same period last year (a surplus of only $2 million then). The 
negative balance of interest payments was at the level of $133 
million (a deficit of $112 million last year). Official gross 
reserves after two months were $4.4 billion, which means an 
increase of $87 million in comparison with January of this year.

  REGIONAL POLICY: This year it will be possible to spend 
approximately 4 trillion zlotys on regional policy, not counting 
other financial resources envisioned in the budget for various 
purpose funds related to the restructuring of gminas (smallest 
administrative units) and voivodships. The Economic Committee of 
the Council of Ministers (KERM) accepted the Principles of the 
State's Regional Policy, prepared by the Central Planning 
Administration (CUP), which envisions a more active regional 
policy. According to Marcin Rybicki, under secretary of state 
in CUP, some of the regions will not cope with their problems 
without the aid of the state. Priorities of the regional policy 
of European states are convergent with those of Polish regional 
policy. This creates good conditions for cooperation in this 
area with highly developed states. This cooperation will also 
make it possible to use the financial resources of the European 
Union earmarked for this purpose -- on the condition that our 
budget must also allocate money for regional policy. This 
condition is met. The 1994 Budget Law envisions a reserve of 
297.2 trillion zlotys for restructuring programs and 573.5 
trillion zlotys for infrastructure investments in regions 
threatened with high unemployment; there will also be money for 
supporting sector programs in industry; the restructuring is 
supported by the Labor Fund as well. Aid from abroad includes, 
first of all, the PHARE (Poland and Hungary Action for 
Restructuring the Economy) STRUDER [not further identified] -- 
60 million ECU and the PHARE of Transfrontier Cooperation 
program -- 55 million ECU. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 19

  MINISTER ON CHINA VISIT: "Poland will widen its economic 
cooperation with China. We can count on export contracts in 
mining, the chemical industry, the energy industry, and the 
aircraft industry," said Industry Minister Marek Pol on his 
return from a visit to China. Due to its rate of economic 
development and an absorbent market, China has been becoming an 
attractive partner even for the biggest industrial powers. 
Minister Pol's visit was intended to widen the contacts and to 
strengthen Poland's position in the Chinese market. The visit 
took place right after the seventh session by a joint 
Polish-Chinese commercial commission. According to the 
commission, the current volume of trade exchange with China is 
$400 million. Poland also wants to join the program of Chinese 
economic reforms. Prices can be one of our assets -- they are 
lower than in the West, with a comparable quality of equipment. 
The visit initiated talks on a contract for supplying light 
aircraft and helicopters. "There is a possibility for providing 
machinery for the mining industry. China has been building 50 
new mines recently," Minister Pol stated. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY 
in Polish 23-24 Apr 94 p 12) 
  COUNCIL TO DEBATE PRIVATIZATION: The State Treasury still 
has 
5,300 enterprises at its disposal. This huge wealth is not 
uniform since apart from enterprises with good future prospects 
and those that need to be rectified, there are also companies 
that should be immediately dissolved. Disputes among different 
ministries have also emerged regarding their different powers in 
the area of ownership transformations. These problems will be 
addressed by a program of commercialization of companies which 
will be debated at the next Council of Ministers' session. 
Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister Andrzej Zebrowski said 
in an interview with a PAP journalist, that one-time 
transformations of state-owned enterprises into companies are 
not called for since many of those enterprises do not meet the 
requirements of the Commercial Code. A review and a selection 
process are necessary, after which a "privatization map" would 
be drawn. It would include three main groups: Enterprises that 
should be privatized as soon as possible would be in one group; 
the second one would include those state- owned enterprises that 
could be commercialized; whereas the third group would comprise 
those enterprises which have been qualified as to be covered by 
managerial contracts. State-owned enterprises in need of 
rectification and those destined to be dissolved, would also be 
distinguished. (Warsaw NOWA EUROPA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 3) 
  GUS DATA ON HOUSING, BROKERS: The Central Office of 
Statistics (GUS) has just released a report on the housing 
market in which it is said that real estate brokers are active 
only in towns with over 20,000 inhabitants. Half of the real 
estate brokers' offices are located in Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz, 
Wroclaw, and Poznan, and out of that amount, one-fourth is in 
Warsaw but only 8 percent in Krakow which is second on the list. 
On average, just two people are employed per agency, with only 
rare instances of offices employing more than 10 or even 20 
people -- these are located in the biggest cities. Slightly 
over 40 percent of the offices also provide legal services, tax 
counselling, keeping commercial books and accounts, or dealing 
in wholesale trade. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 25 Apr 94

  LOT TO LEASE AIRCRAFT: More aircraft that will complement 
the fleet of Lot Polish Airlines will arrive before the end of 
the year. A sixth Boeing 737-500 will come in May, and well as 
an ATR-72. Since passenger traffic is characterized by a very 
high "seasonality factor," many carriers try to lease aircraft 
from other companies for the summer season. For a few years 
now, Lot Polish Airlines has been cooperating with Air New 
Zealand, taking advantage of the fact that traffic reaches a 
maximum level in New Zealand precisely at a point in time when 
it reaches a seasonal low in Poland. An Air New Zealand Boeing 
767-200 will complement Lot's fleet also this year. There are 
also plans to lease another long-distance aircraft, mainly in 
order to service the trans-Atlantic route. According to Piotr 
Ikanowicz of Lot's management, despite increases of expenditures 
to finance the new fleet, profit from using the modern aircraft 
fully justifies purchases planned for the next few years. It is 
still not known though what will happen to Soviet-made Tupolevs 
which have been withdrawn from service. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY 
in Polish 26 Apr 94 p 12) 
  FIFTH CEMENT MILL PRIVATIZED: The Warta cement mill in 
Dzialoszyn, Sieradz Voivodship, has finally been sold: on 22 
April, the protocol of the execution of the preliminary 
agreement, concluded on 24 February, was signed at the Ministry 
of Ownership Transformations. It concerned the sale of 75 
percent of the shares of this Cement and Lime Company to the 
German strategic investor -- Polen Zement 
Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH. The Treasury received 10 million 
German marks (DM) for the shares on the day the agreement was 
concluded. The German company committed itself to implement a 
DM30 million investment program within five years. The 
employment level is to be maintained for three years, the social 
benefits will still be paid, and wages will go up. The Warta 
Cement Mill is going through financial problems due to its high 
debts and overdue credits, which it obtained in the 1980's. The 
new owner of the company is supposed to help resolve the 
problems. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 23-24 Apr 94 p 5) 
  PRIVATIZATION SLOWS: The number of new privatization 
processes has recently decreased, which could be seen already in 
January and February. There are many cases, however, of 
completing the processes that have already been started. 
According to the preliminary estimates by the Ministry of 
Ownership Transformations (the final data will be published in 
the "Dynamics of Privatization"), in the first quarter of the 
year 20 state-run enterprises were transformed into one-person 
Treasury partnerships. It is more than in any quarter of 1993. 
In all, in late March there were 547 one-person Treasury 
partnerships. There also appeared partnerships transformed not 
only on the basis of Articles 5 and 6 of the privatization law, 
but also on the basis of Article 17 of the law on financial 
restructurization of companies and banks. In the first quarter 
of this year three such partnerships were established. Three 
partnerships were sold to strategic investors (in 1993, 47 
partnerships were privatized on the capital road). In line with 
preliminary data, on the basis of Article 37 of the 
Privatization Law the privatization of 21 companies was started 
in the first quarter, which is also less than in any quarter of 
the previous year. On the basis of Article 16 of the law on 
state-run enterprises, 43 liquidation processes were begun and 
that is also less than in any quarter of 1993. Fifty one 
liquidations for privatization were completed -- just as many as 
a year ago, but fewer than in any of the 1993 quarters. The 
bankruptcy liquidation is still slow, but something is changing 
-- 31 processes were completed in the last three months, which 
is more than in the individual quarters of 1993. (Warsaw 
RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 7) 
  QUARTERLY ECONOMIC RESULTS: It has been known for a few days 
now that the economic results of the first quarter of the year 
were very good. This was confirmed by the Central Planning 
Administration (CUP), which estimates the increase in industrial 
production in the first three months at 10.5 percent, and the 
increase in construction production at 7.5 percent. This is 
accompanied by lower inflation -- from almost 10 percent last 
year (level of the prices in March in comparison with December) 
to 5 percent this year. This is the lowest inflation in eight 
years. The financial situation of enterprises improved; the 
foreign exchange reserves of banks increased (by nearly 9 
percent); the revenues of the state budget are growing faster 
than expected. Banks are granting more credits. Increasingly 
more people save their money in zlotys, rather than in foreign 
currencies. In February, for the first time in almost two years 
we achieved a positive balance in the commodity turnover in 
trade. All this occurred despite many unfavorable phenomena in 
politics ('Solidarity' strikes, Belvedere's actions). On the 
other hand, however, it is only just the beginning of the road 
to overcoming the recession. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in Polish 23-24 
April 94 p 4) 
  MARCH ACTIVITY: According to GUS, in March an increase in 
the 
economic activity, especially in industry, construction, and 
trade, was observed; the decrease in employment was curbed and 
the number of unemployed decreased slightly. The average 
employment in enterprises was 0.1 percent higher than a month 
ago, and 3.2 percent lower than a year ago. The number of 
unemployed persons dropped by 19,400. The greatest number of 
unemployed persons (from October) was crossed off the registers 
(152,000). The average wage, along with profit payments, 
increased by 14.8 percent; the real wage increased by 12.3 
percent and was 3.8 percent higher than a year ago. The prices 
of consumer goods and services increased in March by 2 percent. 
The sold production of the industry increased by 16.2 percent 
and was 12.3 percent higher than a year ago. In the first 
quarter production was 10.6 percent greater than a year ago. It 
increased from 23 to 29 divisions of industry -- in 17 by more 
than 10 percent. The greatest increase was noted in the 
following industries: cellulose-paper (by 28.7 percent), food 
(27.9 percent), clothing (21.6 percent), furniture (by 20 
percent), rubber and plastics (by 19.4 percent), products of 
other non-metal raw materials (cement, lime, and plaster) (by 
17.5 percent), coke and oil products (by 17.8 percent). The 
financial results of enterprises improved. In January and 
February they noted a gross financial result of 18.3 trillion 
zlotys (10.4 trillion a year ago); earning capacity was 5 
percent (3.4 percent a year ago), and profitability (per each 
1,000 zlotys of production sold) -- plus 12 zlotys (a year ago 
-- minus 1 zloty). After three months the state deficit was 
19.2 trillion zlotys. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in Polish 25 Apr 94 p 4) 
  EMPLOYEE-OWNED PARTNERSHIPS: The transformation of state-run 
enterprises into employee-owned partnerships turned out to be 
the most frequently used way to privatization. Almost 1,000 
such companies are already operating on the market in Poland and 
most of them achieve relatively good economic results, although 
they are not as good as in private companies. Employee-owned 
partnerships satisfy two main requirements in privatization: 
They still exist, they are much more independent and 
self-reliable, and they are able to pay higher wages to 
employees. Social relations are much better than in state-owned 
enterprises (practically no strikes). The ownership structure 
is not uniform. The average gross earning capacity is 
relatively high -- approximately 8 percent, which is two and a 
half times as much as in the entire economy. The highest 
earning capacity is achieved by the smallest partnerships, 
followed by medium-sized and big companies. Favorable are also 
relations between the net profits and the size of the revenues 
-- the profitability index is 43 zlotys per each 1,000 zlotys of 
revenues. These partnerships display considerable activeness in 
adjusting to the requirements of the market; they use the 
so-called shallow reserves which do not call for investments. 
Lack of money for investments is the most fundamental problem 
of these companies. Another serious problem is that access to 
credits is very limited (lack of security -- the property that 
is at the companies' disposal does not yet belong to them). 
Thus, external capital is becoming increasingly important. 
Participation of foreign investors in employee-owned 
partnerships is still an open issue. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in 
Polish 27 Apr 94 p 5) 
  DRAFT REPRIVATIZATION LAW: On 26 April, the Council of 
Ministers debated a draft law on reprivatization which has been 
initiated by Sejm deputies. The ministers decided they want to 
have their own draft law. The chief of the Ownership 
Transformations Ministry has committed himself to presenting 
such a draft before 11 May. The government view is that 
budgetary capabilities need to be taken into account in the 
process. Once the two draft laws -- one coming from Sejm 
deputies, and the other from the government -- are compared, the 
choice will be made as to which option the Council of Ministers 
will eventually support, Minister Kaczmarek explained. He added 
that a possibility is being considered of holding a referendum 
which would not deal with whether reprivatization is to be 
implemented or not, but to define instead reprivatization's 
scope and extent, and also the way claims by former owners 
should be satisfied. According to the minister's calculations, 
the governmental draft will take into account claims by people 
whose property was nationalized illegally in the 1944-58 period, 
as well as claims regarding property beyond the Bug River. 
Compensations would not be paid out in cash since the budget 
would not be able to bear the burden which is four times the 
current budget deficit. That is why the possibility of 
returning the property in its natural form is being considered 
in cases where that is possible; awarding substitution property, 
or awarding compensation in the form of securities is also being 
considered. The minister said he is aware that such measures 
will definitely not satisfy everyone. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in 
Polish 27 Apr 94 p 10) 
  BANK ANNIVERSARY: The Polish National Bank (NBP) is getting 
ready for the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of Bank Polski. 
The current wave of strikes and the uncertain situation with 
popiwek (salary-controlling legislation) prevent NBP from 
commemorating the anniversary with a lowering of interest rates. 
"We will have to suspend the decision on a possible decrease of 
interest rates until May or even June," NBP Chairwoman Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz told journalists on 27 April. Even though NBP 
was established by a decree of 15 January 1945, it considers 
itself an heir to Bank Polski which was set up 70 years ago and 
that is why NBP has plans for widescale celebrations on the 
occasion. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 28 Apr 94 p 14)

  TURKISH-ROMANIAN BANK INAUGURATED: The Turkish-Romanian 
Bank was inaugurated in Bucharest on 24 March in the presence of 
the Romanian and Turkish presidents. The new bank, which will 
shortly start operations, has a registered capital of 8 billion 
lei, with shares held by Bayindir Holding A.S. 77 percent, the 
Romanian Commercial Bank S.A. 20 percent, Bayindir 
Constructions, Tourism, Commerce and Industry A.S. 1 percent, 
Baysan Constructions, Industry A.S. 1 percent and Bayindir 
Insurance A.H. 1 percent. President Ion Iliescu of Romania and 
President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey spoke of the importance of 
the new institution and its contribution to the promotion of the 
bilateral cooperation. The Turkish-Romanian Bank will give 
credits in lei and hard currency for various investments in 
Romania and for foreign trade operations. Branches will be 
opened in Romania and Turkey, at Constanta, Istanbul, and Ankara 
and insurance and leasing companies will be set up. The 
presidents of Romania and Turkey symbolically opened an account 
at the Turkish-Romanian Bank. Bayindir Holding A.S. is the 
biggest Turkish investor in Romania. (Bucharest ROMPRES in 
English 1816 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  BAC 1-11 MODERNIZATION: The Romanian Government has approved 
a memorandum on the modernization of the BAC 1-11 aircraft. In 
1980, the respective aircraft enterprise -- which turned into 
the commercial company "ROMAERO S.A." after 1989 -- began to 
produce, under a British Aerospace license, short-, long-, and 
medium-range BAC 1-11, series 500 and 475, airplanes. The 
aircraft must be modernized now, in order to meet the noise and 
chemical pollution norms imposed by the International Civil 
Aviation Organisation. The ROMAERO S.A. company initiated a 
program for the BAC 1-11 development, with the participation of 
British Aerospace, Rolls Royce, Alenia, Aim, Honeywell, and 
other firms and it found out a foreign customer, the U.S. 
company Kiwi International Airlines, with which it has concluded 
a contract for the sale of 11 modernized BAC 1-11 planes, with 
an option for another five planes. Some other segments of the 
market have been singled out, such as Argentina, Colombia, 
Chile, Mexico, Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland, Iran, 
Nigeria, the Philippines, the People's Republic of China, and 
Malaysia, which can become active after the first modernized 
plane proves its qualities. The Romanian companies TAROM SA and 
ROMAVIA RA together have 14 BAC 1-11 series 500 planes, that 
have to have their engines changed. A program has been drafted 
for the modernization and manufacturing of a BAC 1-11 series 
2,500 model, to whose research and development the Romanian 
specialists have made a contribution. The new BAC will inherit 
from the BAC 1-11 series 50 plane only the structure, which is 
considered to be among the best in the world. (Bucharest 
ROMPRES in English 1055 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  TEXTILE EXPORTS TO NORTH AMERICA: Romanian exports of 
textiles and clothing to the United States and Canada have grown 
over the January-February 1994 period by 50 percent, compared to 
the same period of 1993. The conclusion of a recent meeting 
between experts of the Ministry of Trade and Romanian textiles 
and garment producers and exporters was that such exports could 
exceed $150 million, under the textile agreements regulating 
Romanian exports to the United States and Canada. (Bucharest 
ROMPRES in English 1259 GMT 26 Mar 94) 
  BALANCE OF TRADE WITH TUNISIA -- The 1993 trade balance 
between Tunisia and Romania was positive for Tunisia, with 
Tunisian exports to Romania accounting for $2,458,269, while 
Romania only exported goods worth $1,268,553 to that country. 
In direct trade relations, Romania imported edibles for 
children, coffee, phosphates, cosmetics, and cotton clothing and 
it exported sodium silicates, rolled goods, household 
appliances, drilling equipment, rolling bearings, and tractors. 
A new direct airline link will provide weekly flights between 
the capitals of the two countries. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 
1103 GMT 28 Mar 94) 
  TRADE WITH GREECE -- There are 828 Greek companies presently 
operating in Romania, placing Greece 14th in rank from the 
viewpoint of the number of foreign companies active in Romania, 
while in terms of investments, Greece ranks 13th, with a 
contribution of $15.2 million. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 
0631 GMT 29 Mar 94) 
  EXPORTS INCREASE: In the first two months of this year, 
Romania's exports grew 24 percent against the corresponding 
period of last year. At the same time, imports dropped over 20 
percent, said Mihai Berinde, head of the Foreign Trade 
Department at the Ministry of Trade. He said that was an 
outcome of the year 1993, marked by a shift in tendency, namely, 
for the first time after 1989, the deficit of Romanian foreign 
trade declined by $250 million as compared with the previous 
year. And, something that is even more significant, the deficit 
was curbed not on account of an import decline, but on account 
of an export rise. The shift of tendency was possible also as a 
result of the growing share of the private sector that has 
become the most dynamic element in the foreign trade activity, 
the official noted. Berinde said that the favorable condition 
of foreign trade last year was not conjunctural. It was 
explained both by the measures to encourage exports and by the 
new outlets gained for Romanian products following the 
conclusion of agreements with the European Union, the European 
Free Trade Association and with the United States. "The world's 
biggest markets have opened to our products and we will have to 
turn to our best advantage the facilities thus offered to us," 
said Berinde, adding that exports were expected to grow 15-20 
percent in 1994. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0809 GMT 31 Mar

  PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY: The Ministry of Industries has been 
examining two projects on the restructuring strategy of the pulp 
and paper industry and the processing of chemical fertilizers. 
"The equipment of the two branches is out-of-date, some of the 
installations in the pulp and paper industry, for instance, are 
more than 100 years old, devices produced 30-40 years ago are 
still in use in the chemical fertilizer industry, Dumitru 
Popescu, minister of industries, told ROMPRES. The main goal is 
therefore, in the next seven years, to introduce technologies 
able to substantially cut energy and raw material consumption. 
The two branches have sure outlets at present, what we want is 
to meet domestic demand. Paper consumption is 10-15 times lower 
in Romania now than in other countries. Last year's production 
of chemical fertilizers was of 265 kgs/ha, while the European 
level is of 300 kgs/ha, added the minister. Two studies, to be 
forwarded to the government, refer among other things to the 
modernization and re-equipping of viable units and the 
dismounting of old installations. As for the staff, only a 
slight reduction is expected, as the two branches will develop 
in future, added Dumitru Popescu. Commercial Companies will 
finance their own modernization, they have to create resources 
to pay domestic and foreign credits, the minister also said. 
(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0832 GMT 4 Apr 94) 
  IRRIGATION SYSTEM: "The drought came unexpectedly and we 
were not prepared for putting the irrigation systems into 
operation," said Vasile Berbeci, state secretary with the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food and head of the Land 
Melioration Department. He mentioned that "this year, 
irrigation work on 2 million hectares is envisaged, taking into 
account the structure of crops, and especially taking into 
consideration the existing equipment. Some 1 million hectares 
cannot be covered with the existing equipment." So far, some 70 
per cent of the pumping aggregates were put into operation. 
"The shortcomings are due to the failure to ensure financial 
resources at the needed level and a delay in the allotment of 
budget subsidies," according to Vasile Berbeci. "To cover all 
our needs, a monthly amount of 12 billion lei must be allotted 
in April and May." "Irrigation work is now performed under 
contracts signed with farm producers. Until 25 march, contracts 
were concluded for 910,000 hectares of which 350,000 are 
hectares with private farmers. This year, the government will 
allot funds to cover the expenses for energy consumption. The 
rest is to be covered by our beneficiaries," State Secretary 
Vasile Berbeci said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0900 GMT 4

  ROMANIAN COMMERCIAL BANK: The Romanian Commercial Bank S.A. 
(limited company) joined the club of the first 1,000 banks of 
the world in terms of capital size and profit, the Romanian bank 
being in 801st place. The Romanian Commercial Bank S.A. was 
ranked 348th among the European banks and 3d among the banks in 
Central and Eastern Europe, after two Czech banks. (Bucharest 
ROMPRES in English 1103 GMT 4 Apr 94) 
  COOPERATION WITH EL SALVADOR: Mutual interest in developing 
bilateral relations allow for the fast establishment of the 
legal basis required for cooperation between Romania and El 
Salvador, said Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu during talks he held 
with the Salvadorean foreign minister in Bucharest on 5 April. 
The guest proposed an initial cooperation project in the 
textile and ready-mades industry, a sector in which both 
countries were competitive. Welcoming the proposal, the 
Romanian prime minister assessed that the products could be 
better promoted in various markets through joint ventures. The 
international fair due in San Salvador in November is considered 
an opportunity to identify other domains of cooperation by the 
parties. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1303 GMT 5 Apr 94) 
  MONETARY SYSTEM `NORMALITY': Romania's money supply 
increased in February 1994 by 7.6 percent compared with January, 
Eugen Radulescu, director of the National Romanian Bank (BNR), 
said in an interview with the government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
Meanwhile convertible hard currency deposits in Romanian banks 
have shown a tendency to drop -- which has not happened in a 
long time -- from $1,045,000,000 in January to $1,027,000,000 
in February, with $1 billion still in accounts opened with these 
banks, added the BNR director. Non-governmental loans have 
grown by 5.7 percent (such as the ones granted by banks to 
economic units and individuals,) thus nearing the rate of 
inflation in February, namely 5.7 percent, while the inflation 
rate stood at 5.9 percent. According to Radulescu, another sign 
of normality is a slight rise in international reserves, from 
$267 million to $284 million. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0716 
GMT 7 Apr 94) 
  FACTORY RECOVERING: The Rulmentul ball- bearings-producing 
company of Brasov, which went through a dramatic decline of 
production and exports after December 1989, made a notable 
recovery in 1993, a tendency expected to continue in 1994 owing 
to the regaining of markets such as the U.S. one. "While in 
1993 it produced 23.6 million bearings, reporting a 25 percent 
growth over the previous year, this year the production of a 
number of 27 million bearings is planned, DIMINEATA reports. 
Export contracts for 13 million bearings have been concluded. 
Since negotiations are under way for new contracts with 
partners on all continents, exports are expected to account for 
80 percent of total production. This is far more than in the 
best years before 1989, when exports covered 55 percent of total 
production. The company's full capacity is 32 million bearings 
a year, but Romanian companies alone do not order large 
quantities of the product and, besides, Rulmentul is facing 
acute financial difficulties. The managers hope the government 
will deal with this, first by granting loans at preferential 
interest rates. As for the importance of the U.S. market after 
Romania was given back most-favored-nation status, which 
resulted in customs duties falling from 67 percent to 7 percent, 
the company's general manager, Sergiu Gherasim, said: "I left 
for the U.S. on 8 November last year, right after the most- 
favored-nation status was announced. I contacted old partners 
and as early as December last year we were able to dispatch the 
first two containers of bearings. We concluded contracts not 
only for 1993 but also for 1994, getting fine profits and 
estimating even better ones, so that our exports to the North 
American market should hold the first place, with at least 15 
million bearings". The company has moved fast to other markets 
as well in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, which will amount to 
an estimated value of $6 million worth of exported bearings this 
year. This ensures the Brasov factory a sound position in the 
world, ranking seventh or eighth, and in Europe, ranking third 
or fourth. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0925 GMT 7 Apr 94) 
  RUSSIANS KEEPING PALLETS: Highly appreciated on markets 
abroad, Romanian furniture cannot reach CIS importers because 
the National Railroad Company's pallet boxes used to transport 
it are not being returned to Romania. They find a most bizarre 
employment: They are turned into sales stands. The fact that 
Romanian furniture is in demand in the former Soviet Union is 
also reflected by the dozens of contracts concluded with 
partners from several CIS republics, as well as by the recent 
results of a specialized fair in Moscow, according to ADEVARUL. 
"At a certain moment, there were some 3,500 empty pallet boxes 
on CIS territory that were not returned to Romania. Part of 
them were then returned, but a number of others (almost 1,500, 
according to the National Railroad Company) are not likely to be 
returned soon or at all," reads the article. It is a fact that 
the Romanian National Railroad Company did not stipulate any 
provisions to avoid such a situation and therefore over the past 
two months not even a single pallet box sent to Moscow with 
furniture has been returned." (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1010

  COOPERATION WITH GREECE PLANNED: The talks held in Athens 
over 6-7 April during the 13th session of the joint 
Romanian-Greek Governmental Commission revealed Greece's 
interest in stepping up investments in Romania, especially in 
the food and clothing manufacturing sectors, in trade, in the 
planning and building of several bridges across the Danube, as 
well as in the modernization of transit and transportation 
systems, reads a press communique released by the Romanian 
Ministry of Trade. The main fields in which Romania is ready to 
invest in Greece are the development and modernization of the 
railroad system, the planning and building of the Salonika 
subway, the building of a rolling stock factory in Triasion, as 
well as promoting telecommunications in the economic area 
covered by the Black Sea Cooperation Agreement. They also plan 
to build and repair ships, manufacture cigarettes under Greek 
licenses, and create several new joint ventures in the food and 
catering sector and in civil engineering. During the session of 
the joint commission stress was laid on the importance of 
expanding bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking 
sectors and intensifying direct contacts between economic agents 
of both countries. Common fields of interest have been 
articulated in a protocol signed by Mihai Berinde, head of the 
Foreign Trade Department at the Romanian Ministry of Trade, and 
by Yannis Papantonios, deputy minister in the National Economy 
Ministry of Greece. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0953 GMT 11

  TELECOMMUNICATIONS MODERNIZED: Two digital telephone 
exchanges have recently been commissioned in Bucharest, with an 
aggregate capacity of 20,000 lines. They are equipped with 
Alcatel and Siemens equipment, which allows for connection with 
international networks of optic fiber cables. The Romanian 
telecommunications system has acquired, as Communications 
Minister Andrei Chirica said in an interview for VOCEA ROMANIEI, 
"consistency" in its development schemes. Various branches of 
Romanian industry have concurred in the modernization of the 
telecommunications system, and foreign capital in relevant joint 
ventures has also provided for the production of equipment in 
accordance with the latest technologies. In the coming years 
most efforts will be directed to the development of the 
telecommunications infrastructure, with priority given to 
services open to competition, such as mobile telecommunication, 
cellular telephones, data transmission, and private radio and 
television networks. Intended to help the computerization 
program of the entire Romanian society elaborated by the 
Romanian National Board of Informatics, the Ministry of 
Communications has already issued the license for two private 
companies: One dealing in data transmission, set up by 
Romtelecom with a French firm, and the other established with an 
U.S. partner. Subscribers will soon have access to the 
international networks of Euronet, Internet, and to important 
data bases, the minister said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 
1720 GMT 12 Apr) 
  SOUTH KOREAN ENVOY: In a recent press interview, the South 
Korean ambassador stressed that his country's relations with 
Romania are excellent, despite the fact that diplomatic 
relations were established only in 1990. He also recalled the 
fact that South Korea supplied $15-million worth of aid for the 
development of the telecommunication network in the Prahova 
County area, to expand collaboration in trade, the car 
manufacturing industry, and in the manufacturing of medical 
equipment. Approaching the issue of investments, the South 
Korean ambassador said that "things are somehow going slow, even 
though the South Korean businessmen's interest is high. They 
believe that Romania is a country with a major potential, with 
natural resources, skilled labor force, and an ideal 
geographical location. I also consider that once the situation 
stabilizes and a more attractive legislative framework is 
adopted, the South Korean companies will have greater incentives 
to invest in Romania." (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0650 GMT 
15 Apr 94) 
  CORPORATION RESTRUCTURING: A report on the restructuring of 
national and local corporations was presented at the weekly 
cabinet meeting of 15 April. Some 79 companies are involved, 
that is 1.2 percent of all the state-owned companies, belonging 
to five ministries -- industry, agriculture, transport, 
communications, and environment. The idea is to turn them into 
commercial companies. Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said 
that, in his opinion, there should be seven or eight national 
corporations in Romania. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1427 GMT 
16 Apr 94) 
  CAR SALES CENTER: A modern national "Dacia" car sales center 
opened in the town of Pitesti, 100 km northwest of Bucharest. 
Designed after similar centers abroad, the automobile "Dacia" 
S.A. company has set up this center in order to sell its 
products -- cars and spare parts -- through a unitary system. 
"The center is a flexible, modern commercial structure, headed 
by an elite team that attaches great importance to the image of 
the Dacia car builder," Constantin Stroe, general manager of the 
plant, told the press. The center's priority is "to fully 
satisfy buyers" and eliminate brokerage firms, which are "keen 
on making maximum revenues at the expense of the customers." 
The company, which can supply 230 cars every day, will direct 
the sales flow of the entire "Dacia" car and spare parts 
production. A computer network has been designed for the 
delivery of cars, sub-assemblies, and spare parts to individual 
buyers and firms on request. Cooperation contracts will be 
signed with 48 leasing units based in all large Romanian towns 
and the Bucharest municipality. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 
1709 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  AGRICULTURE MINISTER COMMENTS: According to Agriculture 
Minister Ion Oancea, "the only chance for Romania to develop its 
farming sector so as to be able to compete on international 
markets is to make full use of the country's economic and 
natural assets." He also said that "we can and must become the 
country with the highest agricultural potential in this part of 
Europe," adding that 40 percent of Romania's 9.4 million 
hectares -- approximately 23 million acres of arable land -- are 
located in plains of unsurpassed fertility in Europe, which also 
boast irrigation systems for some 3 million hectares; if duly 
operated, these resources alone could meet the nation's food 
requirements, under the worst weather conditions. Minister 
Oancea also said that Romania was the first European country 
that introduced and extended the crops of hybrid maize 
nationwide and that the Fundulea Research Station labs, situated 
near Bucharest, are among the best in the world in the 
development of a sunflower hybrid, which is exported all over 
the world. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0828 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  COOPERATION WITH CROATIA: Branko Jeren, minister of science 
and technology of Croatia, and Doru Dumitru Palade, Romanian 
minister of research and technology, signed a protocol of 
technological and scientific cooperation on April 19 in 
Bucharest meant to ease the work on some common objectives of 
major interest in the transition period. The protocol provides 
for cooperation in certain joint research and development 
projects, the joint use of research-development facilities and 
scientific equipment, improvement of know-how transfers, and 
mutual assistance in the creation of an information system in 
the relevant fields. A joint commission will be set up to 
implement the provisions of the protocol. (Bucharest ROMPRES in 
English 1651 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  LEU FLOATS: The latest Inter Bank auction session registered 
a novel turn in such transactions: The supply of convertible 
currency exceeded the demand for it -- that is, $4.27 million 
were available against $4.17 million on demand, as of 18 April. 
At the beginning, the news that supply was greater than demand 
came as a surprise, tinged with distrust as to its credibility. 
And yet, this tendency has stayed to this very day, so that the 
National Bank of Romania (BNR) was able to issue a statement, 
which reads as follows: "The leu is floating freely now. As a 
result of the course of the currency market, the value has 
modified insignificantly." However, the same statement then 
cautions: "For these favorable conditions to remain constant, 
it is necessary to encourage profitable enterprises -- that is, 
those which produce for export -- because, by the rules of the 
economic laws, the devaluation of the national currency usually 
follows the rate of inflation." The "interpretation" given to 
this text by BNR Governor Mugur Isarescu in a recent interview 
is much more practical: "The government, the State Ownership 
Fund, and the Private Ownership Funds must take steps toward 
restructuring and privatization. We need foreign crediting." 
According to Eugen Radulescu, BNR director for monetary 
policies, the leu's liberalization is an accomplished fact. He 
said that "for a long time the National Bank purchased hard 
currency, forced by the need to make current payments, which was 
one of the reasons why it could not achieve an equilibrium on 
the market. At the moment, the National Bank has reserves of 
some $100 million, compared to only about $20 million earlier 
this year. The payments we have to make are much below this 
sum, so that we are no longer struggling with the same 
problems." Mr. Radulescu also said that the currency supply is 
provided by the resident currency owners, who have about $1 
billion deposited in their accounts in Romania. "Corporate and 
individual hard currency owners are beginning to sell just 
because they feel that the rate set by the BNR is the real rate 
of the market," he said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0925 GMT

  COMPANIES AT HANNOVER FAIR: Beginning on 20 April, Romania 
will be represented by 16 state-owned and private companies at 
the greatest technical fair of the world "Hannover '94." The 
Romanian firms at the fair are presenting on a 75-square meter 
area gauging and adjustment apparatuses, steel samples, complex 
mechanisms, boilers and heating systems, semi-conductors, and 
technical specifications for Romanian-made electric and 
electronic goods. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1127 GMT 20 Apr

  NEW BANK: The Industrial and Commercial Credit Bank S.A. was 
officially opened in Bucharest on Wednesday, April 20. The new 
bank funded with U.S. and Romanian capital worth 2 billion lei 
has tight cooperation relations with two big Israeli banks, 
Hapoalim and American Israel Bank, and enjoys a joint Romanian- 
Israeli management team. (Bucharest ROMPRES 1151 GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  NEW BUILDING MATERIAL: Already commissioned in Bucharest is 
a factory manufacturing a new building material, so-called 
durref, the invention of the Romanian engineer Andrei Holodi. 
This stupendous stuff is a mixture of natural wastes compacted 
through the change of their molecular structure, a process that 
makes it the best substitute for wood yet known. It is fire- 
proof, non-toxic, non-polluting, and gamma-ray-resistant; it 
wears better than wood in water, can imitate marble, 
pattern-work, and wood veneer. Pieces of durref can be joined 
together with glue, making nails unnecessary. Durref can be 
used for houses, furniture, and floorings. The raw material 
used for its manufacturing comes from litter bins or rubbish 
dumps provided that it is natural or has natural fiber in its 
composition: wood wastes, straw, stems, leaves, weeds, 
thistles, willow, paper wastes, wastes from vegetable-fiber 
fabrics, animal hair and skin, and vegetable and fruit wastes. 
Durref can be used in civil and industrial engineering, in the 
consumer goods industry, in the aeronautical and shipbuilding 
industries and the electronic industry. According to the 
inventor, three quarters of durref products are water-proof. 
Durref is gamma-ray resistant and bulletproof. After 25 
freezing and defreezing cycles the material did not show any 
sign of degradation. The durref industry has the quality of 
endlessly recycling its own wastes. The most spectacular field 
in which durref can be used, according to its inventor, is that 
of civil engineering. According to a study, a 100 square meter 
house built with durref and possibly decorated with durref 
furniture, costs up to $8,000 (40 per cent lower than the cost 
of a house built with convectional material). In a statement 
made to the Swedish review AFAERER AND FORETAG (Business and 
Societies), which recently published an article on durref, 
Andrei Hododi said: "to manufacture durref from waste products 
could become a hobby of the future". The invention has been 
licensed in 31 of the most industrialized countries of the 
world. After the December 1989 revolution, Andrei Holodi 
established his own company starting with a nominal capital of 
100,000 lei. On 22 April 1994, the first durref factory was set 
up near Bucharest. The factory currently employs some 500 
workers in three shifts, with a monthly output worth 1.6 billion 
lei. According to the owner of the durref company, some 100,000 
workers will be employed in such activity in the future. 
(Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1657 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  NEW FREE TRADE ZONE: The Romanian Government approved the 
establishment of a new free trade zone at Galati, port on the 
Danube. The new zone joins the club of the free zones of Sulina 
(at the mouth of the Danube) and Constanta Sud-Agigea (a Black 
Sea port). The legal framework for creating free zones was 
worked out in the summer of 1992. The rationale was for 
stimulation to improve management and marketing, that foreign 
investment would be attracted, high quality services would 
develop, state and local administration income would surge, and 
joint ventures would emerge through foreign capital and 
technology. The land and the buildings included by the free 
zone can be subject to lease and concession to persons, be they 
natural or juristic, Romanian or foreign, for terms as long as 
50 years according to the kind of activity and value of the 
investment. The commodities to come from foreign countries or 
to be sent to foreign countries, entering or leaving the free 
zones, are exempted from tariff or tax duties. The economic 
agents operating in the free zones are exempted from excise 
duty, income tax, and value-added tax for the whole duration of 
their activities in the free zones. Romanian goods used for 
constructing, repairing, and maintaining objects in the interior 
of the free zones are exempted from tariffs. Goods can be moved 
between the free zones without incurring tariffs. Other free 
zones are planned for Braila, Curtici, Cristesti, Oradea, Satu 
Mare, Giurgiu, Turnu Magurele, Turnu Severin, and Basarabi.

  BUSINESS REVIEW: FOCUS ROMANIA, the first international 
business review devoted exclusively to Romania is being issued 
by the publishing company Group 24 Publishing Ltd. It was 
launched at the recent Bucharest meeting of the Crans Montana 
Forum on emerging markets. In English, the review contains 
data, studies, and commentaries on business opportunities in 
Romania and is expected to be distributed to major companies, 
individuals, and organizations in the G-24 and in Romania. The 
first issue of FOCUS ROMANIA came out in April in Bucharest and 
mass circulation is to start in August 1994. The manager of 
Group 24 Publishing Ltd. was quoted by the daily ROMANIA LIBERA 
as saying that the review would be free of any political or 
commercial interest. The launching of the review was attended 
by Niall Barrett, Ray Karam, and Hashi Syedain, on behalf of the 
publisher, and for the Romanian side, by presidential adviser 
Misu Negritoiu and State Secretary Napoleon Pop. (Bucharest 
ROMPRES in English 0814 GMT 27 Apr 94) 
  MERCEDES SERVICE CENTER OPENS: With President Ion Iliescu 
and other officials in attendance, Mercedes Benz Auto- Rom 
Service Center was inaugurated on Wednesday, 27 April, in 
Bucharest, one of the largest and most modern servicing units in 
Europe. This and seven other similar service shops in Romania 
will provide maintenance for Mercedes cars in Romania. Speaking 
at the opening, President Ion Iliescu hoped that the company 
would open an assembly line in Romania for Mercedes buses. 
Peter K.M. Fietzek, member of the Mercedes-Benz Board of 
Directors, illustrated the development of the Romanian market by 
recalling that "the general agency of the Mercedes-Benz Auto-Rom 
was established in June 1990, and, compared with other Eastern 
European countries, Auto-Rom has reached a very high standard. 
In our view, Auto-Rom and Mercedes- Benz are capable of 
satisfying the demands of the Romanian market, an assessment 
confirmed by the car sales in 1993." Mercedes-Benz, he said, 
was lucky to find a partner like the Romanian Ion Tiriac (the 
former tennis player), who has made remarkable investment and 
had this center built in Bucharest, which can serve as a model 
for all Eastern Europe and complies with the Western European 
standard of the German Company." (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 
1455 GMT 27 Apr 94) 
  LOAN INSTALLMENTS RELEASED: The Romanian Ministry of Finance 
has announced that the World Bank has decided to release the 
second part of the structural adjustment loan to Romania, worth 
$150 million. In addition to this amount there will be Japan's 
Eximbank's contribution of $37.5 million, and a $7.5-million 
share from the Dutch Government. The aggregate amount of $195 
million is meant to help Romania's balance of payments. The 
first part of the structural adjustment loan, that is $250 
million, was granted to Romania in June 1992. The release means 
the deblocking of external financing for Romania after more than 
a year and a half. This course is to continue once approval is 
given in early May to the standby agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund and the financial aid approved by 
G-24 becomes effective. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1545 GMT

  MINERS DEMAND PROTECTED MARKET: Marian Mesiarik, chairman 
of the Trade Union of Mining, Geology, and Oil Industry Workers, 
said after a meeting of the trade union's leadership at Lucky on 
18 March that "the time is ripe to protect the Slovak brown coal 
market." The concept approved by the Slovak Government, under 
which almost 40 percent of Slovakia's annual consumption of 10 
million tonnes of brown coal is to come from domestic mines, is 
not being observed, Mesiarik said, because small and 
medium-sized consumers, in particular, prefer imported Czech 
coal. This coal is cheaper, according to Mesiarik, because both 
the coal price and freight fares remain regulated in the Czech 
Republic. Mesiarik said that miners are ready to resort to 
"pressure actions" if the "negative trend," which poses a threat 
to mining jobs, continues. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 19 Mar

  TOURISM REVENUES, PROSPECTS: According to Milena 
Jankovicova, director of the Tourism Section at the Slovak 
Ministry of Economy, Slovakia's foreign exchange earnings from 
tourism increased from a mere $28 million in 1989 to $241 
million in 1993 and are estimated to reach $600 million annually 
by 1996. Slovakia has 45,300 hotel beds, 4,500 beds in trade 
union-owned recreational facilities, almost 11,000 beds in spa 
resorts, almost 50,000 beds in company-owned recreational 
facilities, and 200,000 beds in privately owned recreational 
facilities. More than 12,000 businesses with 65,000 employees 
are involved in the provision of services for tourists.

  FEBRUARY UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES: Labor offices in the Slovak 
Republic registered 376,030 job-seekers at the end of February, 
3,140 fewer than in January. The rate of unemployment thus 
dropped from 14.88 percent in January to 14.76 percent in 
February. A total of 110,046 job seekers were collecting 
unemployment benefits at the end of February, 8,182 fewer than 
in January. The number of unemployed included 44,284 school 
graduates, compared with 46,842 in January. Employers reported 
8,104 job vacancies in February, compared with 8,290 the month 
before. The number of job-seekers per vacant job was 46 in 
February, which is an improvement over the December 1993 ratio 
of 48 to 1. The districts with the highest rate of unemployment 
are Rimavska Sobota (26.65 percent in February), Spisska Nova 
Ves (24.10 percent), and Vranov nad Toplou (23.99 percent); 
those with the lowest rate of unemployment are Bratislava-City 
(4.31 percent), Trencin (8.28 percent), and Kosice-City (9.99 
percent). (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 21 Mar 94 p 5) 
  STOCK MARKET INDEX: In a joint article in the economic daily 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, the Bratislava Securities Exchange (BCPB) 
and the Austrian-owned Creditanstalt Bratislava a.s. investment 
company announced the launching of SAX, the Slovak stock market 
index. The index is based on the development of the shares of 
eight companies -- Slovnaft, East Slovak Iron Works, Nafta 
Gbely, Vseobecna Uverova Banka (General Credit Bank, VUB), 
Slovenska Pojistovna (Slovak Insurance Company), Biotika 
Slovenska Lupca, Investicna a Rozvojova Banka (Investment and 
Development Bank, IRB), and Ozeta Trencin. These shares have 
been selected on the basis of their crucial share in the BCPB's 
turnover (79.07 percent since trading on the BCPB started), 
their liquidity, their market capitalization, and the 
availability of information (verified by respected auditing 
firms) on the conduct of their business. The starting day of 
the index was determined to be 14 September 1993, the first day 
when all the shares included in SAX had their price quoted on 
the BCPB; the initial value for that day has been set at 100. 
The SAX value for 21 March 1994 was 397.97, which means an 
almost 400 percent increase of the index in seven months.

  AUSTRIAN BANKS' CURRENCY TRADING: Following initial 
restraint and fears of the Slovak koruna's possible devaluation, 
Austrian banks have started selling and buying the Slovak 
currency. They offer 32 Austrian schillings for Sk100, while 
Austrian travelers to Slovakia are charged 40 Austrian 
schillings for Sk100. The exchange rate of the Czech koruna is 
slightly higher than the Slovak koruna's exchange rate: 
Austrian banks buy 100 Czech korunas for 37.50 to 38.50 
Austrian schillings and sell them for 44.50 Austrian schillings. 
Strictly speaking, the Vienna trade in the Slovak koruna is 
illegal because it is not convertible and because it is 
forbidden to take it across the border. (Bratislava NARODNA 
OBRODA in Slovak 22 Mar 94 p 2) 
  CAR SALES: A total of 60,868 passenger cars and small 
utility vans were sold in Slovakia in 1993, of which 21,570 were 
sold by official importers and another 5,500 by other trading 
companies. The only domestic manufacturer, TAZ Trnava, which 
produces small utility vans, sold 796 vehicles in Slovakia last 
year and had thus a market share of 1.31 percent. Individual 
imports of passenger cars are estimated at 83,000, which is a 22 
percent increase over 1992. In the category of cars sold by 
official importers, the number one marque was Skoda (14,793 
vehicles), followed by Volkswagen (1,541), and Lada (1,483). 
Only three other manufacturers managed to sell more than 500 
cars in Slovakia in 1993 -- Seat (595), Ford (543), and Tavria 
(508). (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 23 Mar 94 p 6) 
  ENERGY PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION: Slovak power stations 
delivered to the power grid 23,417 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of 
electricity in 1993, 1,077 GWh more than the year before. A 
slight decline in the generation of electricity by nuclear, 
steam, and company-owned power stations was more than offset by 
the increased production of hydroelectric power stations, 
particularly the Gabcikovo plant. Electricity consumption 
totalled 27,408 GWh, which was 1,627 GWh more than in 1992. The 
most important foreign supplier of electricity to Slovakia was 
the Czech Republic, which accounted for 86 percent of Slovak 
electricity imports. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 23 
Mar 94 p 2) 
  BANKS PROFIT ON CURRENCY SPLIT: According to Marian Jusko, 
vice governor of the Slovak National Bank (NBS), the NBS and the 
Czech National Bank (CNB) both profited from the currency split 
of 8 February 1993 and the concomitant withdrawal of the 
"federal" currency. As Jusko told the Bratislava daily SME, 
preliminary data indicate that the two central banks had 
withdrawn 3.5 to 4 billion federal korunas less than had been in 
circulation. This difference, the bulk of which is accounted for 
by banknotes that had been illegally abroad, will represent the 
two central banks' profit. Whereas the NBS had withdrawn 5 
billion korunas less than its agreed proportion of the federal 
currency in circulation, the CNB had withdrawn 1 to 1.5 billion 
more. The issue of how to divide the profit will be subject of 
talks between the two central banks' banking councils, Jusko 
told SME. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 23 Mar 94 p 1) 
  BUILDING INDUSTRY RECESSION: The construction industry has 
shed 115,000 people since 1990 and the construction volume has 
fallen by 43 percent, according to Gabriel Blaskovic, executive 
director of the Union of Slovak Contractors (ZSPS). In 1993 
alone, the volume of building output declined 23.8 percent, 
compared with 1992. Only 5 percent of Slovakia's working 
population is engaged in the construction sector, Blaskovic 
said, compared with 7 to 9 percent in "advanced countries." 
Addressing a ZSPS general assembly in Banska Bystrica on 23 
March, Blaskovic said that, together with retailing and tourism, 
the building industry is "the best transformed branch of the 
national economy." Whereas six years ago there were 83 building 
firms in Slovakia employing an average of 2,400 people, today 
there are 1,134 firms with under 25 employees and 520 firms with 
25 and more employees. The ZSPS associates 470 construction 
firms representing 60 percent of Slovakia's building capacity. 
Blaskovic also said that, compared with the "European 
standard," Slovakia is short of 500,000 apartments. Only 14,047 
apartments were completed in 1993, of which 8,205 were built by 
private individuals, 2,217 by communities, over 3,700 by housing 
cooperatives, and more than 150 by companies for their own 
employees. Another 50,000 apartments are currently under 
construction and, given the present speed of construction, it 
will take up to 10 years to complete them. The number of 
housing starts dropped to 4,387 last year and the export of 
building work dropped from 5.8 billion korunas in 1992 to Sk2.8 
billion in 1993. The high credit interest rates of over 20 
percent are responsible for an "unfavorable investment climate" 
and aggravate building firms' insolvency and indebtedness. 
According to ZSPS Chairman Frantisek Slavik, the building 
industry employed more than 143,000 people in 1993. (Bratislava

  FORECAST FOR 1994: The MESA 10 research company, whose aim 
is 
to provide objective macroeconomic and social analyses that are 
independent of state agencies and institutions, predicts a 
further 2 to 3 percent decline in GDP in 1994, regardless of the 
method of reform policy pursued by the government. The rate of 
inflation will be in the range of 24.5 to 28 percent, MESA 10 
predicts, the state budget deficit will reach Sk20 to 25 
billion, but could even reach Sk30 billion "if developments get 
out of hand," and the rate of unemployment will increase to 17 
to 19 percent. In its analysis, MESA 10 reaches the conclusion 
that "a turnabout in transformation policy is to a far greater 
extent a political problem than a purely economic problem." It 
explains Slovakia's lag behind the Czech Republic precisely by 
the "insufficient general will for transformation." (Bratislava

  DEBT INCREASES: The Slovak Government's and the Slovak 
National Bank's "official indebtedness" reached $1.892 billion 
by 31 December 1993, up from $1.625 billion at the beginning of 
the year. The "overall gross indebtedness in foreign currency," 
which includes the debts of commercial banks, the foreign 
currency debts of the enterprise sphere, and the Slovak 
Republic's debt on the clearing account with the Czech Republic, 
amounted to $3.169 billion at the end of 1993, compared with 
$2.322 at the beginning of the year. Of the $3.169 aggregate 
end-of-1993 debt, $2.888 billion was debt in convertible 
currencies. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 24 Mar 94

  REPORT ON ZSR: The Slovak Railways (ZSR), which employ 
58,000 people, is the largest employer in Slovakia. In 1993, it 
carried 64,825,000 tonnes of freight and 86.3 million 
passengers. The new ZSR management, which assumed office on 8 
April 1993, managed to reduce the ZSR's outstanding claims from 
Sk3.7 billion in November 1993 to Sk2.5 billion in February 1994 
and the ZSR's liabilities from Sk2.5 billion to Sk1.4 billion. 
This a result of mutual settlement of claims between the ZSR 
and its trading partners and of "measures adopted against 
domestic and foreign non-payers." (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE

  IRON WORKS PROFIT: According to Peter Hrinko, president of 
the East Slovak Iron Works [VSZ] a.s., the company made a profit 
of Sk195.5 million in 1993, which was 82.7 percent of the 
planned profit of Sk236 million. All VSZ subsidiaries ended the 
year with a profit, with the exception of VSZ Steel (loss of 
Sk58 million) and VSZ Industria (loss of Sk535 million). The 
new VSZ Board of Directors, which was elected in December 1993, 
has paid off within three months Sk1.5 billion of the VSZ's 
Sk2.1 billion debt toward the state budget. By the end of the 
year it wants to settle Sk850 million worth of debts owed to its 
suppliers of capital goods. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 28 Mar

  STEEL EXPORTS TO EU: The aim of the meeting of a joint 
committee of the Slovak Republic and the European Union (EU) in 
Bratislava on 28 March was to amend the regime for Slovak steel 
exports to EU countries. The European Union offered additional 
quotas for Slovak steel exports in 1994 that would be exempt 
from duty. The offer was for an extra 20,000 tonnes of hot- 
rolled sheets, 100,000 tonnes of hot-rolled strips, and 5,000 
tonnes of seamless tubes. The quantities in question will be 
exported to the FRG for further processing. Slovakia will also 
be allowed to export 33,000 tonnes of steel products to the 
former GDR over and above the original quota. On the other 
hand, the European Union demanded that Slovak exports of 
hot-rolled sheets for May-December 1993 be subjected to a 
supplementary customs duty because, according to EU statistics, 
these exports were in excess of the approved quota. The Slovak 
side "proved" that the EU statistics are inaccurate and 
recommended to the joint committee that no supplementary duty be 
levied on any steel products exported to the European Union.

  NUCLEAR CLOSURE, ENERGY CAPACITY: Slovakia will not need any 
more energy capacity, nuclear or otherwise, to meet its domestic 
needs, the Austrian news agency APA said on 30 March, citing an 
estimate by the Viennese representative of the French company 
Electricite de France (EdF), Jean-Alain Vaujour. APA was 
reacting to a television announcement by Slovak Economic 
Minister Petr Magvasi that the first Czechoslovak -- now Slovak 
-- nuclear power station at Jaslovske Bohunice, west Slovakia, 
could be adapted to prolong its life until 2000. EdF is 
Slovakia's main partner in the bringing of Mochovce nuclear 
power station, also in west Slovakia, up to Western European 
safety standards. The agency reports that the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is investing in the 
completion and modernization of Mochovce, is asking that when 
Mochovce is opened in 1996, Slovakia closes down two blocks of 
the antiquated Bohunice station. It quotes Minister Magvasi as 
saying, however, that given the considerable cost of shutting 
down the two blocks, their closure in 1996 must be reconsidered.

  CREDIT FOR ALUMINUM PLANT: At its meeting on 29 March, the 
Slovak Government approved a government guarantee for the 
$40-million first installment of a European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) credit to finance the 
modernization of aluminum production in the Slovak National 
Uprising (SNP) Works at Ziar nad Hronom. The $95-million second 
installment of the EBRD credit and the subsequent entry by the 
Norwegian Hydroaluminium Oslo company and the EBRD as 
shareholders into the Slovalco company (a joint venture of SNP 
Ziar nad Hronom and the two prospective foreign partners) will 
be discussed by the government at a later date. The two 
prospective partners are making their $30- million investment in 
Slovalco conditional on a reduced electricity price for the 
aluminum plant, which should not exceed 3 cents per kilowatt 
hour. However, even this calculation is based on a projected 
aluminum price of $1,700 per tonne, which is $500 above the 
current price of aluminum on world markets. At the same 
meeting, the government did not accept the proposal by the 
Slovensky Energeticky Podnik (Slovak Energy Company, SEP) state 
enterprise that the state reduce SEP payments to the state 
budget "until the new tariff policy in the sphere of electricity 
prices becomes fully operative." SEP justified its proposal by 
the need for long-term low-price electricity deliveries to 
Slovalco, which will consume about 6 percent of Slovakia's 
electricity. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 30 Mar 94 p 1) 
  CREDIT WELCOMED: Jozef Pittner, director general of SNP Ziar 
nad Hronom, welcomed the provision of a government guarantee for 
an EBRD credit for the aluminum maker as a "competent decision 
resulting from the demonstrable effectiveness of the project." 
According to Pittner, the technology used will guarantee energy 
consumption that will be 17 percent lower than the world 
average. Besides, the cost of the new electrolysis and the 
other facilities foreseen in the project will represent only 
about 60 percent of the cost of a similar aluminum plant 
anywhere in the world. The modernized plant will also meet the 
"strictest European environmental norms," Pittner said. The 
involvement of foreign capital in the project will make it 
possible to settle the claims of more than 170 domestic and 
foreign suppliers, to launch the first of the projected 172 
electrolyzers in October this year, and to start producing 
105,000 tonnes of aluminum annually as of 1995. (Bratislava

  JANUARY TRADE DEFICIT: Imports to the Slovak Republic 
amounted to 13.565 billion Slovak korunas (Sk) in January 1994, 
compared with exports of Sk12.545 billion. More than 42 percent 
of imports came from the Czech Republic. This transpires from 
statistics of the Central Customs Administration of the Slovak 
Republic. Slovakia had a balance of trade surplus with EU 
countries in January, having exported Sk3.75 billion and 
imported Sk3.40 billion worth of goods. EU countries accounted 
for 29.89 percent of the Slovak Republic's exports and 25.08 
percent of its imports. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak

  PLANT PRIVATIZATION RAISES QUESTIONS: The former government 
of Vladimir Meciar approved the privatization project for the 
Kovohuty Krompachy state enterprise on 11 March -- that is, on 
the day of its dismissal by the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic. The company, whose book value is Sk1.2 billion, was 
sold directly to the Coper Krompachy Ltd. for Sk300 million to 
be repaid over a period of 10 years. At the same time, the 
Coper Ltd. pledged to invest Sk500 million in the metallurgical 
company in the course of 10 years. As G. Palacka, state 
secretary at the Ministry of Privatization, told the daily SME, 
the offer advanced by Coper Ltd. was worse than that of an 
unspecified "U.S. company" that supposedly offered to pay Sk300 
million and invest Sk800 million in Krompachy over the next six 
years. Quoting a "source that does not wish to be named," SME 
reported that the documents on the privatization of Kovohuty 
Krompachy were signed during the company director's business 
trip to Russia by his deputy. According to SME, the Coper Ltd. 
subsequently installed this man as company director. (Bratislava

  GASOLINE PRICES: The Ministry of Finance issued a decree 
changing the maximum prices of gasoline effective 1 April. The

  UNSTAMPED CIGARETTES OUTLAWED: The sale of domestically 
manufactured as well as imported cigarettes and other tobacco 
products that are not provided with a protective stamp bearing 
the state emblem of the Slovak Republic becomes illegal in 
Slovakia as of 1 April 1994. The main reason for "stamping" 
cigarettes is to protect the market against smuggled cigarettes 
and to prevent tax evasion. An exception has been granted to 
Czech and Slovak manufacturers of cigarettes packed in so-called 
hard boxes, the stamping of which will start in July. The sale 
of unstamped Czech and Slovak cigarettes packed in hard boxes 
will be banned as of 1 October 1994. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 2

in the Istrochem Bratislava state enterprise and agreed with the 
continued operation of the viscose rayon production facilities 
until 31 December 1995. Environment Minister Juraj Hrasko said 
the government's decision was conditional on "permanent 
monitoring of the emissions and odor of pollutants" and on the

  CZECH TRUCK PROBLEM AFFECTS SLOVAKS: About 70 percent of the 
1,560 employees of the Automobilova Vyroba Cadca (AVC) a.s., the 
former Tatra company, will stay home from 5 April until the end 
of the month and collect 60 percent of their average wages, on 
the basis of an agreement concluded between the management and 
the trade union organization. The suspension of production for a 
whole month is necessary because the main customer, the Czech 
truck maker Tatra Koprivnice, and a Turkish customer, the Kornas 
company, have suspended their purchases. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Slovak 6 Apr 94 p 2) Because Tatra Koprivnice has

Sipox a.s. at Banovce nad Bebravou will be forced to close its 
operations that produce parts for the Czech truck maker from 5 
April to 31 May. This measure will affect 1,469 employees of 
the Banovce automobile plant, who will receive 60 percent of 
their wages. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 6 Apr 94 p 16) 
  INDUSTRIAL DECLINE SLOWS: According to an analysis carried 
out by the Slovak Union of Industry, the decline of the Slovak 
industry did not come to a halt in 1993 but the rate of decline 
slowed down. The most critical situation is in engineering 
where "four-fifths of all enterprises are ripe for bankruptcy." 
The production volume of engineering enterprises declined 23 
percent in 1993 (compared with an 11 percent decline in 1992), 
sales 20 percent (17), exports 8 percent (12), domestic sales 31 
percent (47), and the number of employees 16 percent (15). 
Exports to the former USSR declined 30 percent and exports to 
OECD countries 3 percent (following a 93 percent increase in 
exports to these countries in 1992). Slovak engineering 
enterprises suffered an aggregate operating loss of Sk3.9 
billion, which was 16.6 percent of the production volume. The 
situation of electrical engineering enterprises was similarly 
grim. Their aggregate turnover declined 24 percent (14), 
production volume 19 percent (27 percent), and the number of 
employees 15 percent (22). Wood-processing, textile, and 
chemical companies also registered production decline and 
decline in sales in 1993. The only industrial branches to 
report growth for 1993 are metallurgy (5 percent rise in 
production and 3 percent rise in sales), glass (16 percent rise 
in exports and 8 percent rise in domestic sales), and the 
printing industry (8 percent production growth and 10 percent 
increase in sales). (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 8 Apr 94 p 7) 
  DECREASE IN DEPOSITS, CREDITS: "Primary koruna deposits by 
non-banking entities" in commercial banks and the Slovak 
National Bank reached Sk201.8 billion at the end of January 
1994, which is a Sk7.1 billion (3.4 percent) decline against the 
end of December 1993. Deposits by the "population" amounted to 
Sk113.3 billion at the end of January and represented 56.1 
percent of the total volume of deposits. While koruna deposits 
declined in January, deposits in foreign exchange increased by 
the equivalent of Sk1.5 billion and reached the equivalent of 
Sk31.3 billion by the end of the month. When both koruna and 
foreign exchange deposits are considered, the volume of deposits 
decreased by Sk5.6 billion, that is, 2.3 percent, in January. 
Over the same period (December 1993-January 1994), the overall 
volume of koruna credits declined by Sk3.1 billion to Sk257.4 
billion, which is a 1.2 percent decline. The volume of credits 
declined most strikingly, by 6.4 percent, with respect to state 
enterprises and organizations, which, however, continue to 
account for 48.1 percent of the aggregate credit volume (Sk123.9 
billion). Credits taken by the population decreased 0.3 
percent, to Sk18.3 billion, which is 7.1 percent of the credit 
volume. The volume of credits in foreign exchange increased by 
the equivalent of Sk0.3 billion, to Sk8.8 billion. The 
aggregate credit volume (in korunas and foreign currencies) 
reached Sk266.2 billion at the end of January. (Bratislava

  VW BRATISLAVA RESULTS, PLANS: The Volkswagen Bratislava Ltd. 
produced 3,000 VW Passats in 1993 and, although the company 
continues to operate at a loss, the loss for 1993 was Sk120 
million lower than projected. In 1994 the company plans to 
produce 5,000 VW Passat B4 models, more than 41,000 gearboxes, 
and launch the production of the VW Golf model by the end of the 
year. The total value of production should reach Sk3.5 billion 
and make 1994 the first year in which the Bratislava plant will 
make a profit. Originally, the Bratislava plant was not expected 
to become profitable until 1997. Volkswagen Bratislava plans to 
hire 300 people this year, which will increase its workforce to 
1,500. (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 8 Apr 94 p 7; Bratislava

  CLEARING ACCOUNT DEFICIT: The clearing account between 
Slovakia and the Czech Republic showed a Slovak deficit of 40 
million European Currency Units (ECUs) as of 8 April, compared 
with 51 million ECUs at the end of March and 126 million ECUs at 
the end of February. As O. Kvacek from the Czech National Bank 
Press Department told the daily SME, the decline could be 
attributed to Slovakia's introduction of new qualitative 
requirements for food imports in February and to the 
introduction of a 10 percent import surcharge in March. 
(Bratislava SME in Slovak 9 Mar 94 p 1) 
  TRUE BUDGET DEFICIT: According to Ivan Miklos, deputy 
chairman of the Democratic Party and former minister of 
privatization, the "true deficit of the state budget of the 
Slovak Republic for 1993 is approximately Sk34 billion" and not 
Sk23 billion as officially announced. According to Miklos, it 
is necessary to add to the official deficit Sk5.8 billion in 
credit extended to Slovakia by the Czech Republic within the 
framework of the clearing account and another Sk6 billion, which 
is the size of the debt run up by state institutions, especially 
in health care, education, and the judiciary, in the course of 
1993. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 9 Apr 94 p 2)

president of the National Property Fund, told NARODNA OBRODA, 
domestic and foreign experts have been voicing "reservations" 
about Slovenska Banka because the state was to have a majority 
stake in its capital stock. He pointed out that it was odd to 
try to set up another state bank at a time when the state was 
trying to transform state banks into commercial banks with a 
preponderance of private capital. (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in

  BUDGET DEFICIT REDUCED: According to Jozef Trojak, state 
secretary at the Ministry of Finance, the budget management of 
the Slovak Republic showed a deficit of Sk2 billion as of 8 
April, compared with a deficit of Sk5.9 billion at the end of 
the first quarter. While revenues from value-added tax and 
consumer tax are coming in as projected, the fulfillment of 
revenues from the corporate tax is "lagging behind somewhat."

  CONSUMER PRICE INCREASE: Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in 
February 1994, compared with January 1994. Food prices went up 
0.4 percent, the prices of non-food items 0.6 percent, the cost 
of restaurant meals 0.7 percent, and the cost of services 1.7 
percent. Compared with December 1993, consumer prices went up 
2.1 percent and compared with February 1993 15.3 percent. The

  PAPER, PULP MILL MODERNIZATION: The modernization of pulp 
production and the construction of a new paper plant is planned 
by the Bukoza a.s. at Vranov nad Toplou in cooperation with the 
U.S. World Alliance Merchant Finance Company (WAMF Co.) based in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts. A new paper machine with an annual 
capacity for 140,000 tonnes of so-called coated wood-free paper 
is to be supplied by the U.S. Beloid company. The Bukoza 
management has been negotiating with the International Forest 
Product Corporation from Boston, which guarantees the sale of 
the entire production volume on world markets for 20 years. A 
study drawn up by WAMF Co. in cooperation with the Hurter 
Consult Incorporated from Ottawa, Canada, demonstrates that the 
investment costs of $216 million (approximately seven billion 
Slovak korunas) would be recouped within three years; the U.S. 
EXIM Bank would invest about $80 million in the project. After 
three years, the annual profit should amount to approximately 
$30 million. The U.S. partners demand Slovak Government 
guarantees for the project and the transformation of Bukoza into 
a holding, an organizational configuration not provided for by 
existing Slovak legislation. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 8 Apr

  MINE PRIVATIZATION PLANNED: The management and employees of 
the Dolina Mine in Velky Krtis see privatization as a possible 
way out of the unfavorable situation in Slovak brown coal 
mining. According to Martin Huba, the mine's director, theirs 
is the first project of this kind in Slovakia and within the 
framework of the former Czechoslovakia. The mine, which is the 
largest employer in the region, provides work for about 1,500 
people. Under the privatization plan, the management will own 
35 percent of the shares and workers and the technical and 
administrative staff 65 percent. The lowest stake in the Dolina 
a.s. has been set at 500 Slovak korunas [Sk] and the highest at 
Sk10,000. The constituent general meeting of shareholders is 
scheduled for 7 May. The mine's property, the book value of 
which is Sk550 million, is to be transferred to the new owner 
free of charge. The mine plans to extract 600,000 tonnes of 
coal this year, but contracts for only 450,000 tonnes have been 
concluded to date. To be able to compete with cheaper Czech 
coal, the Velky Krtis mine has lowered its price to Sk750 per 
tonne. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 11 Apr 94 p 5; Bratislava

  RUBBER PACKINGS FOR AUTOS: ContiTech-Vegum, a Slovak-German 
joint venture at Dolne Vestenice, will produce this month the 
first rubber packing profiles for various models of Volkswagen 
and Mercedes Benz passenger cars. The assembly of the 
production lines, which were supplied by the German partner, is 
now "culminating." According to Pavol Janega, the company 
director, they will be put into operation gradually. The Slovak 
side has an approximately 60 percent majority in ContiTech- 
Vegum, which was established in mid-February. The joint venture 
is to produce Sk215 million worth of packings for Czech, German, 
and other foreign car manufacturers by the end of the year. The 
production volume is to double within two to three years.

  WORKS SUSPENDS WAGES: The VSS, East Slovak Engineering 
Works, 
Kosice a.s. is facing a financial crisis and the management has 
been forced to resort to "unpopular measures." On Tuesday, 12 
April, the 1,588 VSS employees did not receive any wages and the 
management and the trade union organization started talks on 
reducing the working week to four days between the 17th and 22d 
week of the calender year. Although all three VSS production 
plants signed lucrative contracts for 1994, there are problems 
with payments. The VSS management complains that "even firms 
that we know are well off have stopped paying." (Bratislava 
SMENA in Slovak 14 Apr 94 p 5) 
  PRODUCTION, WAGES DECLINE: The monthly production volume of 
Slovak industry declined 2.3 percent in February 1994, compared 
with January 1994, but was 3.2 percent higher than in February 
1993, the Slovak Statistical Office reports. The construction 
volume was 6.4 percent lower than in January 1994 and 14.9 
percent lower than in February 1993. The average monthly wage 
in enterprises with more than 25 employees reached Sk5,409 in 
February, 2.6 percent less than in January. Real wages in 
industry fell 3.3 percent, in construction 4 percent, in 
retailing 1.5 percent, and in transportation 4.7 percent, 
compared with January. (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 14 Apr 94

  LICENSE DENIAL EXPLAINED: Asked why the Slovak National 
Bank, NBS, Banking Council failed, at its meeting on 8 April, to 
issue a license to Slovenska Banka, whose founder and sole 
shareholder is the National Property Fund, FNM, of the Slovak 
Republic, NBS Spokesman Juraj Matejovsky told the daily SME on 
13 April that, although the FNM's application was "formally in 
order," the Banking Council turned it down because of 
"nonfulfillment of conditions concerning the origin of capital 
stock and the economic purposefulness of the bank." (Bratislava 
SME in Slovak 14 Apr 94 p 2) Following the negative decision of 
the NBS Banking Council, the Slovenska Banka Board is exploring 
possibilities of raising its capital stock in keeping with 
legislative conditions in order to achieve the required majority 
stake of private capital. (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak

  BRATISLAVA TRANSPORTATION CUTS: The depleted account of 
Dopravni Podnik, DP, the Bratislava municipal transport 
authority, will necessitate cuts in the scale of public 
transportation as of 18 April. Whereas in 1992 DP received from 
the state budget a subsidy of 786 million korunas, this year it 
will receive only Sk414 million. Moreover, the City of 
Bratislava owes the DP Sk100 million (70 million for 1993 and 30 
million for the first three months of 1994). As a result, the 
DP itself owes its suppliers "millions" and the Slovnaft 
refinery threatens to halt supplies of diesel fuel unless DP 
pays its outstanding bills. Right now, DP has diesel fuel in 
stock for only one day and is forced to start implementing 
"stage one of reducing mass public transport" in the capital. 
This first stage, which affects only buses, will reduce normal 
operating hours until 2300 (instead of 2400 or even later) and 
alter and reduce the lines operated at night. Some bus lines 
that run parallel to streetcar lines will also be abolished, 
shortened, or altered. If the situation does not improve, "stage 
two" will have to be implemented, which will affect streetcars 
and trolley buses as well. According to Deputy Mayor Klacansky, 
although the reduction of the state subsidy over the last two 
years represented 40 percent, the changes introduced on 18 April 
will represent a mere 13 percent reduction in performance.

  DIE WELT ON NUCLEAR PLANTS: Of the more than 40 nuclear 
power 
plants with Russian technology in eastern Europe, not one meets 
Western safety standards, including the west Slovak power plant 
in Mochovce, the Berlin paper DIE WELT wrote on 14 April. 
Shortly before completing the construction of the first two 
reactors, the newly established Slovak state ran out of money. 
The West came to the rescue: the German power concern 
Bayernwerk and the French Electricite de France offered to 
complete construction on the two reactors for 1.3 billion German 
marks. The Slovaks agreed to repay that loan with power 
supplies; one of those reactors will produce power exclusively 
for the western network for 12-15 years. The price of one 
kilowatt hour will be about six pfennigs, which is quite a 
bargain for the Bavarian concern, because one kilowatt hour 
produced in the thermal electricity plant in Bavaria costs at 
least three times as much, the newspaper wrote. What is more, 
Slovakia carries all the risks involved, since it must pay for 
everything from the liquidation of spent fuel to the shut- down 
of the power plant at the end of the operation period, according 
to the article. Slovak environmentalists have a dim view of 
Slovakia's future: "We will become a nuclear colony of the 
West," a Greenpeace representative in Bratislava told DIE WELT. 
(Prague CTK in English 1549 GMT 14 Apr 94) 
  KOSICE APARTMENTS: The price per square meter for city-owned 
apartments in Kosice was set by the City Council at a flat rate 
of 200 Slovak crowns, Deputy Mayor Peter Kucharsky told CTK. He 
explained that the housing developments on the edges of town are 
more modern, but they are not as well equipped. The 
infrastructure in those areas is also less developed than in the 
center, where the apartments are older but land is more 
expensive, he added. Discounts were approved for special cases. 
For instance, if more than half the tenants in an apartment 
building with at least four apartments wish to purchase their 
apartments, they are eligible for a 25-percent discount, and if 
all the tenants decide to buy, they have the right to a 
50-percent discount, Kucharsky said. Discounts will also be 
given for payment in cash. If a tenant does not apply to 
purchase an apartment within 11 years, the apartment will remain 
city property, he added. An information office to advise 
potential buyers has been opened at the City Hall. City 
administrators have already received several thousand 
applications to purchase city-owned apartments, Kucharsky said.

  OIL REFINERY RESULTS, PLANS: The Slovnaft a.s., Slovakia's 
only oil refinery and petrochemical combine, processed 4.2 
million tonnes of crude oil in 1993 and made a pre-tax profit of 
Sk1.611 billion (after Sk1.879 billion in 1992) on sales of Sk25 
billion, 43 percent of which were realized abroad. Besides, 
Slovnaft surrendered Sk11.7 billion to the state budget in 1993. 
The Slovnaft Board proposes to the 25 May 1994 annual meeting of 
shareholders that a dividend of one percent of the Slovnaft 
shares' nominal value (that is Sk10 per share) be paid to 
shareholders. The management also intends to propose to the 
annual meeting a 20 percent increase in the capital stock; 
proceeds from the sale of this new issue of shares should cover 
about 20 percent of the $500 million cost of a project for 
processing heavy residual fractions. This will be one of the 
largest investment projects in Slovakia, comparable in scale 
only to the Gabcikovo dam and the Mochovce nuclear power 
station. Slovnaft has reduced its workforce from 7,000 in 1992 
to 5,920 at present and plans to reduce employment to under 
5,000 by the end of this year. This will be made possible by 
modernization projects that reduce the labor-intensiveness of 
production. In 1994 Slovnaft intends to process the same 
quantity of crude oil as in 1993 but expects to increase its 
profit by Sk600 million thanks to manpower savings and better 
utilization of crude oil. Addressing a news conference in 
Bratislava on 14 April, Slovnaft Director General Slavomir 
Hatina announced that talks with the Austrian OeMV petrochemical 
combine on OeMV's capital stake in Slovnaft have been suspended 
because "the two companies do not intend to back away from their 
positions on several disputed issues." Slovnaft therefore 
intends to resume negotiations with six other prospective 
foreign partners. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 15 Apr 94 p 1;

  COMPANIES' PROFITS, LOSSES: According to Finance Minister 
Rudolf Filkus, Slovak companies that operated at a loss in 1993 
generated an aggregate loss of 42 billion Slovak korunas (Sk). 
In this way, they reduced the overall profit of Slovak economic 
organizations for that year from Sk68 billion to Sk26 billion.

  DIGITAL TELEPHONE NETWORK: Slovak Telecommunications, in 
cooperation with the Canadian Northern Telecom company, 
completed the first stage of the national digital transmission 
network and put it into operation on 15 April. The network is 
based on the STM-1 and STM-4 "add-drop ring" technology; STM-1 
permits the concurrent transmission of 2,000 voice connections 
through optical cables, while the capacity of STM-4 is four 
times bigger. The technology is part of the SDH (Synchronous 
Digital Hierarchy) system, which Northern Telecom developed in 
1989 and which is among the most sophisticated in the world. 
According to Wolfgang Steiert, Northern Telecom Vice President 
for Central and Eastern Europe, the rapid implementation of the 
first stage of the network was made possible by the abilities of 
Slovak engineers, who have mastered the new technology in record 
time. The project was financed partly by a Northern Telecom 
credit, the guarantee for which had been assumed by the British 
Government, after the then Czechoslovak Federal Government 
refused to provide a credit guarantee. (Bratislava NARODNA

  CONTINUOUS CASTING PROJECT: The most important investment 
project of the East Slovak Iron Works (VSZ) Kosice in 1994 is an 
extensive modernization and reconstruction of its continuous 
casting facility Number One. The work on the project, which 
will cost Sk2.493 billion, starts on 18 April and will last 
about three months. Some 1,700 people will be involved in the 
realization of the project, which pursues three objectives -- 
raising quality, cutting costs, and improving the environment in 
the Kosice conurbation. The East Slovak Iron Works plan to 
increase the proportion of steel produced by the continuous 
casting method from two-thirds at present to 100 percent by the 
end of the year. The basic equipment for the modernization 
project will be supplied by the VOEST Alpine Industrieanlagenbau 
from Linz, Austria. Following its reconstruction, the new 
facility should produce about 2 million tonnes of steel 
annually. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 16 Apr 94 p 7; Bratislava

  NEW BRATISLAVA CASINO: The Casinos Slovakia a.s., partners 
in which are the state-run SATUR (Slovak Agency for Tourism) and

in the Reduta Hall, the seat of Slovak Philharmonics, in 
Bratislava on 16 April. The Casino-Cafe Reduta is actually an 
exclusive cafe with gaming tables; it is open daily from 1300. 
The minimum stake is Sk10 or 20 Austrian schillings. The 
premises of the Casino-Cafe, which used to house the Bratislava 
office of Czechoslovak Airlines, were reconstructed at a cost of 
more than 35 million Austrian schillings. (Bratislava PRAVDA in

  AUTO PLANT LAYOFFS: Some 260 workers of the Automobilova 
Vyroba Cadca (Automobile Production Cadca, AVC) a.s. were given 
two-months' notice at the end of March and another approximately 
100 workers are expected to be given notice in the coming weeks. 
The workforce of this once second largest company in the Kysuce 
region, which used to employ 2,800 people, will thus be reduced 
to 1,100 by mid-1994. According to AVC Director General Jiri 
Hadenec, three reasons made the management resort to lay-offs. 
The first reason is another production cut in the Czech Tatra 
Koprivnice truck factory, which buys about 60 percent of AVC's 
production volume. Tatra Koprivnice planned to assemble 4,500 
trucks this year but it is now apparent that the actual number 
will not exceed 3,800. The second reason is that cooperation 
with Tatra Koprivnice will be scaled down as of 1996, when Tatra 
plans to launch a new model. Tatra intends to produce some 
components for this new model itself or in cooperation with 
manufacturers in the Czech Republic. The third reason is the 
failure of the Turkish firm Karsan, for which AVC produces 
gearboxes under license, to accept the originally contracted 
number of gearboxes. Supplies for Karsan accounted for 30 
percent of AVC's production volume in 1993. Hadenec hopes that, 
after acquiring new production orders, AVC will rehire some of 
the workers it is now forced to lay off. At 23 percent, the 
rate of unemployment in Cadca district is one of the highest in 
the country. [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 18 Apr 94 p 3) 
  MEZ ENGINES CERTIFIED: After three years of efforts by its 
management, the MEZ Michalovce company, which manufactures 
single-phase asynchronous two-speed engines for washing 
machines, has been awarded a certificate of the international 
auditing firm SGS that the quality control system for its 
engines complies with the ISO 9001 standard. According to MEZ 
Director General Michal Boka, the certificate should help 
resolve the existential problems of the company, which was "at 
the brink of collapse" only a year ago, and strengthen its 
position in price negotiations. MEZ has stopped laying off 
workers and has even started hiring new ones. The quality of 
MEZ engines has reached such a standard that only 256 of 1 
million units are defective, compared with a West European 
average of 500. MEZ plans to produce 775,000 engines for 
washing machines this year, 95 percent of which will be 
exported. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 18 Apr 94 p 3) 
  CAR CABLING PRODUCTION: The Siemens Automotive Michalovce 
Ltd., one of three companies belonging to the MEZ Michalovce 
a.s., has started producing cabling for Ford Fiesta cars, in 
cooperation with the German Siemens AG. Within two months, it 
will gradually increase production to 100 and, subsequently, to 
200 sets per shift. Eventually, it will become the sole producer 
of cabling for the new Ford Fiesta model. The company, which 
currently employs 300 people, plans to hire another 450 workers 
by the end of the year. The annual production volume is to 
reach Sk1.1 billion. According to MEZ Director General Michal 
Boka, the value of a single set of cabling, including 
electronics and accessory equipment, exceeds that of the entire 
Fiesta car body. (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 21 Apr 94

  DECLINE IN TRADE DEFICIT: Slovakia has further reduced the 
deficit on the clearing account with the Czech Republic. 
According to Slovak National Bank data, the Slovak deficit 
amounted to 42 million European Currency Units (ECU) on 15 
April, down from 59.5 million ECU on 1 April. Of the 42 million 
ECU, 34 million were on the so-called new account and 8 million 
on the old account, which registers payments for transactions 
realized prior to the currency split of 8 February 1993. 
(Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 19 Apr 94 p 2) By 19 
April, the Slovak deficit on the clearing account dropped to 
35.944 million ECU (Sk1.406 billion), of which 27.119 million 
ECU were on the new account and 8.824 million on the old 
account. (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 20 Apr 94 p 1) 
  BRATISLAVA CABLE TV: The Systemova Kablova Televizia (System

television network to date and plans to invest another 
approximately Sk400 million by the end of this year. This 
should help increase the number of subscriber households from 
approximately 53,000 at present to 90,000-100,000 by the end of 
the year. SKT employs 31 people and has generated another 450 
jobs in subcontractor firms. It charges subscribers between Sk75 
and Sk90 per month, which is about 20 percent of the price 
charged in neighboring Vienna. The "package" offered by SKT

  MINISTER ON FOOD IMPORT TAX: The tax on Slovak food imports 
averages 12 percent, Slovak Agriculture Minister Pavol Koncos 
said on Slovak Radio on 18 April. Under the GATT agreement, 
food taxes will gradually be reduced by 40 percent on average. 
Owing to Slovakia's taxes being low, the country's farmers do 
not have to fear their reduction, Koncos said, adding that 
Slovakia may profit to a certain extent from the GATT members' 
promise to lower export tariffs and state subsidies. 
"Effectively, there is nothing to lower in Slovakia," Koncos 
said, adding that signing GATT two years ago would have given 
exports a boost but today apart from cheese and several other 
commodities, there was nothing Slovakia might export. Koncos 
also said that a preparatory committee is being formed to work 
out a detailed structure and status for the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). (Prague CTK in English 1212 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  GATT SIGNING: According to Economy Minister Peter Magvasi, 
who headed the Slovak delegation to the signing of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT at Marrakesh, Morocco, Slovakia signed the GATT 
document "with the exception of the parts on milk and beef 
cattle, because these commodities are yet to be the subject of 
negotiations at the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture." (Bratislava

  GAS PROFITS HIGHER: The Nafta Gbely a.s., which produces 4.5 
percent of Slovakia's natural gas consumption and 1 percent of 
its crude oil consumption, further strengthened its positions on 
the domestic and foreign markets in 1993, the second year of its 
existence. One of the company's most important lines of 
business is the storage of imported natural gas in underground 
reservoirs. Nafta Gbely has a monopoly on this activity in 
Slovakia and provides its services to Czech and German gas 
distributors as well. The company invested Sk784 million in 
1993, mostly in the construction of an underground gas reservoir 
at Lab and in the gas collection center at Senne, and made a 
profit of Sk830,588 million, 49.2 percent more than the year 
before. The business plan for 1994 foresees another 10 percent 
rise in profits. The majority stake in Nafta Gbely, which was 
one of the most sought-after Slovak companies in the first wave 
of coupon privatization, is held by the National Property Fund 
(52.2 percent), followed by investment funds (39.5 percent), and 
individual investors (8.3 percent). Nafta Gbely employs 2,727 
people. It is one of nine companies registered on the listed 
market of the Bratislava Securities Exchange. (Bratislava

more employees delivered 72.148 billion Czech korunas' (Kc) 
worth of goods to Slovakia in 1993, which was 30 percent less 
than in 1992 and 35.6 percent less than in 1991, the Czech 
Statistical Office announced. Czech imports from Slovakia 
totalled Kc70.431 billion in 1993, 17 percent less than in 1992 
and 28.6 percent less than in 1991. The CR's trade surplus 
declined from Kc18.298 billion in 1992 to Kc1.717 in 1993.

state secretary at the Ministry of Transportation, 
Communications, and Public Works, only 64.8 million metric tons 
of freight were carried by railroad in Slovakia in 1993, 
compared with 127.7 million metric tons in 1989. This 
represents a drop of almost 50 percent. (Bratislava PRAVDA in

  WAGE DEVELOPMENT: Average monthly wages amounted to Sk5,264 
in Slovakia in 1993, which was 17.5 percent more than in 1992. 
Average wages in private companies (Sk5,414) exceeded average 
wages in state organizations (Sk5,290). The lowest average 
wages were recorded in cooperatives (Sk4,379) and the highest in 
international and foreign-owned organizations (Sk8,174). In 
regional terms, the highest average wages were in Bratislava 
(Sk6,238), followed by East Slovakia (Sk5,023), Central Slovakia 
(Sk4,957), and West Slovakia (Sk4,910). Svidnik (Sk4,136) was 
the district with the lowest average wages in Slovakia in 1993. 
Branches with the highest average earnings were banking 
(Sk10,609) and the insurance business (Sk9,404); those with the 
lowest earnings were the textile industry (Sk3,931) and social 
services (Sk4,113). (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 21

  PRODUCTION FOR ISRAEL, GERMANY: Of the approximately 1,000 
freight cars to be manufactured by the Vagonka Poprad state 
enterprise this year, 82 will be exported to Israel. These 
container cars will be assembled in Israel under the supervision 
of a group of experts from Poprad. A few days ago, the Poprad 
management signed a contract with a German partner for the 
delivery of approximately 3,000 undercarriages in 1994 and 1995. 
According to Vagonka Director Frantisek Kralik, the company 
seeks privatization by means of employee stock ownership.

  GOLD, SILVER MINING: According to Felix Sekula, director of 
the Kosice-based Geotechnology Institute of the Slovak Academy 
of Sciences, Slovakia could cover a substantial part of its 
consumption of precious metals (which amounted to 1,600 kg of 
gold and 40,000 kg of silver in 1991) from its own extraction. 
Findings about the distribution of precious metals in 
geological formations show the presence of some 15,000 kg of 
gold and 150,000 kg of silver in "verified deposits," Sekula 
told the Bratislava daily PRAVDA, adding that "geologists' 
prognoses about gold and silver deposits in Slovakia are even 10 
times higher." In Sekula's opinion, using existing methods of 
extraction, it should be possible to increase annual gold 
production from the present 500 to 725 kg and silver production 
from 12,400 to 64,100 kg. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 23 Apr 94

  FARM SUBSIDY CUT PROTEST: In a letter addressed to Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik, the Slovak Agricultural and Food 
Chamber (SPPK) protested against alleged plans to reduce 
agricultural subsidies by another Sk400 million this year. The 
SPPK pointed out that agricultural subsidies dropped from 
approximately Sk18 billion in 1989 to Sk7 billion this year and 
are now deep below the level customary in the countries of the 
European Union and elsewhere in the world. According to the 
SPPK, while the prices of farm products went up only 28 percent 
between 1989 and the end of 1993, the prices of agricultural 
machinery, fertilizers, and herbicides and pesticides more than 
doubled in the same period. The SPPK warned that, should 
subsidies be cut further, the absolute majority of agricultural 
enterprises would be unable to halt the production decline and 
secure food supplies, "which could have unforeseeable 
consequences for our state." (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 23

  WASHING MACHINE SUCCESS: Only 18 months after the launch of 
their production, washing machines manufactured by the 
U.S.-Slovak Whirlpool Tatramat joint venture in Poprad, and 
marketed under the Philips Whirlpool label, hold the first place 
on both the Czech and Slovak markets. The Poprad plant will 
manufacture about 150,000 washing machines this year, almost 70 
percent of which will be exported to the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, and Argentina. Whirlpool Tatramat must still 
import some components for its washing machines, but it intends 
to limit these imports and give a chance to domestic 
manufacturers to supply not only the Poprad plant but also 
another 11 Whirlpool plants in Europe. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on Democratic Party Chairman Eduard </F>
Selami's speech at a meeting in Gjirokaster; date not given: 
"Albanian-Greek Relations Should Not Influence Our Stand Toward 
the Greek Minority in Albania"] 
  [Text] At a large meeting in the Gjirokaster city cinema 
and theater hall, PD [Democratic Party] Chairman Eduard Selami 
spoke to PD members and sympathizers and the people of 
Gjirokaster constituency. Among other things, he dealt with 
Albanian-Greek relations. Also attending the meeting were DP 
General Secretary Tritan Shehu; Rexhep Uka, minister without 
portfolio for local government problems; Minister of Education 
Xhezair Teliti; Genc Ruli, deputy for the Gjirokaster 
constituency; and Sokrat Kalidhopuli, chairman of the district 
council. 
  "We came to this open meeting," Mr. Selami said, "as 
representatives of the party in power -- the Democratic Party -- 
and of the local state organs, to listen to your concerns and 
exchange opinions on how to solve all the problems that are 
soluble. 
  "The DP has been governing the country for the last two 
years. Over this period, there have been both achievements and 
shortcomings, but we have never concealed the latter. It has 
been a difficult period, but one that has also been full of many 
hopes. It has been and still is characterized by successes on 
the road toward democracy and a market economy, toward Europe 
and Western civilization. It is the beginning of a long haul 
toward our future, in which much remains to be done, because 
democracy is a thing that always strives for perfection. Aside 
from problems of the economic reform and its implementation, and 
problems regarding Gjirokaster itself, it would be of great 
interest to broach here the relations with our southern 
neighbor, Greece, to discuss the grave incident of April 10, and 
to have your opinions on these issues. This is another reason 
why we came to Gjirokaster. 
  "We are living at a time of great change," Mr. Selami 
continued, "a time when the period of destruction and overcoming 
communism unfortunately, in our region, very soon gave way to a 
period of war fraught with extreme nationalism that today is 
reflected in its most acute form in the former Yugoslavia, and 
Bosnia in particular. This crisis, the greatest one since World 
War II -- not only on a regional scale, but also on a European 
one -- is also one of the world's greatest crises. In this 
respect, our policy has always been one of finding a peaceful 
solution and negotiation, ruling out any change of frontiers by 
force. However, at the same time it has been a policy of 
defending Albanian interests. In this regard, we think that 
these sorts of problems will remain in the region. Peaceful 
solutions, not only in Bosnia, but also other parts of 
Yugoslavia, look extremely remote. In Kosova and elsewhere, 
there are big problems. We are therefore of the opinion that a 
host of difficulties relating to the international situation are 
becoming added to the natural difficulties that our reform -- 
one of the deepest and most radical ones -- has brought in 
Albania...." 
  Dealing with Albania's relations with our southern neighbor, 
which is also a member of the European Community, PD Chairman 
Eduard Selami stated: "We have been and continue to be in favor 
of good relations, but things have not gone as they should. 
Certain things have become tense and aggravated. As for the 
incident, you have already heard our stern condemnation and 
denunciation of the perpetrators. We have complained about this 
to the relevant international bodies, urging them to find the 
culprits and put the responsibility for what happened on those 
who really deserve it. In the context of our state-to-state 
dealings, this event has impaired our relationship, but there 
has been no lack of determination on our part, and it must be 
mentioned that Greece, too, has responded positively to our 
resolve. We therefore think that, through good will and 
dialogue, these issues can be resolved. However, it remains our 
precondition that the culprits must be identified. They must 
accept their responsibility, and Greece should also admit its 
responsibility here, because it is involved in an incident that 
requires a just solution. The matter has been put before all 
the international bodies and the various groups set up to 
investigate the case. They will clarify many things, but it is 
natural that Albania, as the injured party, has reacted strongly 
in its own right. Such incidents tend to strain the relations 
between our two countries. The incident we are speaking about 
is not an isolated one. There are certain circles in Greece 
that are interested in destabilizing relations with Albania. 
This can be seen in the inhumane Greek conduct towards the 
Albanian refugees as well as other provocations stemming from a 
certain concept -- the concept of Vorio-Epirus. 
  "As the party in power, we always follow a straight line. We 
have respected and continue to respect the Greek minority 
because we appreciate its contribution; it sees its future in 
Albania and does not play any destabilizing role, but on the 
contrary makes its own contribution to democracy in Albania. As 
we continuously perfect democracy in Albania, the demands of the 
Greek minority will certainly increase. Our relations with the 
Greek minority, which in Gjirokaster have a long and positive 
tradition of humane cooperation, must not serve as the cause of 
a breakup in our relations with Greece. It is a pity that time 
and again there emerge extremist attitudes, irresponsible 
declarations, and certain stands that aggravate the situation. 
We, as the Democratic Party, have welcomed members of the Greek 
minority into our ranks, placing them in government posts, in 
parliamentary positions, in the education system, and so on. As 
far as we are concerned, the Greek minority is a factor of 
stability. We will continue marching along the same road of 
good understanding with Greece, because it is not only to the 
benefit of Albania and Greece, but also to that of our region as 
a whole. We really do want cooperation, but we also want mutual 
obligations to be honored. Our two neighboring countries, being 
the most ancient countries in the Balkans, must render their 
services to stability and peace. The PD is of the opinion that 
the time has already come for Greek-Albanian relations not to be 
dominated by ancient instincts and nationalistic spirits founded 
on extremist religious attitudes." 
  The meeting was also addressed by Messrs. Shehu, Uka, 
Teliti, 
and Kalidhopulli, who answered questions put by the audience. 
  After the meeting, Mr. Selami and other dignitaries went to 
pay condolences to the family of the martyr Fatmir Shehu, the 
army officer killed in the 10 April massacre.

<F P=106> ["G.V."-signed commentary: "Arben Xhaferi and Mendu Baci </F>
Are in Tirana. Is it a Party in Exile or..."] 
  [Text] A PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] delegation 
has been visiting Tirana for the past few days. This is the 
party of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], namely one half of the 
so-called radical wing based in Tetovo and led by Arben Xhaferi 
and Mendu Taci. 
  Over these past few days, the delegation has had intensive 
meetings with [Albanian Democratic Party, DP, leaders] Eduard 
Selami and Tritan Shehu, with DP deputies, and perhaps with the 
Albanian head of state himself, Mr. Sali Berisha, who also 
received the credentials of the ambassador of the Republic of 
Macedonia in Tirana during the same period. 
  The newspapers have written nothing at all about this 
delegation. Neither the radio nor the television mentioned it. 
Why? How can one explain this silence when, in the past, every 
one of their visits was received with fanfares and given 
detailed television coverage. 
  The delegation stayed in villa no. 30. Today it may have 
left. Or perhaps it is still there. Who knows? The villa is 
guarded by soldiers who are members of the SHiK [National 
Security Service]. Or perhaps, on the way to Tetova, they are 
taking a break in Durres or Pogradec, resting in the government 
residential villas, as the former nomenklatura villas are called 
today. In a few days' time perhaps, the newspaper of the ruling 
party and the television will announce, "A friendly visit has 
been paid to our country..." -- as the practice once was with 
the Marxist-Leninist party groups that we nannied in secrecy so 
that they could put on weight and get fat in the nomenklatura 
villas in Durres, Vlore, Pogradec, and so on. 
  There is nothing wrong with receiving and seeing off a PDP 
group. The evil lies in the silence and secrecy. It is worse if 
such a thing is done at someone else's expense.

  [Text] Malaysia and Albania have signed a landmark 
memorandum of understanding [MOU], paving the way for Malaysian 
military officers to train the soldiers of the former communist 
republic. For a start, Malaysia has agreed to train 25 Albanian 
officers this year. The MOU was signed by Defense Minister 
Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak and his Albanian counterpart Encik 
[Mr.] Safet Zhulali in Tirana, Albania. Under the MOU, 
Malaysian and Albanian armed forces will also hold exchange 
programs and joint exercises, cooperate in the fields of science 
and technology, as well as embark on business cooperation in the 
defense industry. Datuk Sri Najib said Malaysia would also 
assist the Eastern European state in the modernization and the 
upgrading of its armed forces. Speaking at the signing 
ceremony, he said the MOU would pave the way for closer 
cooperation between the two countries. Briefing Malaysian 
journalists later, he said Malaysia had approved a special fund 
of 2.6 million ringgit to assist in the development of the 
Albanian Armed Forces.

  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] The denouement of the 
crisis surrounding Gorazde has shown the world that the NATO air 
strikes that were carried out against Serbian civilian and 
military targets around that town on two occasions were 
unjustified interference by the international community in the 
conflict and the direct involvement of the United Nations on the 
Muslims' side in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  After NATO's air force, in the last 48 hours, UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] has also sided with the Muslims. Members of 
the Nordic Battalion fired from a personnel carrier, killing 
nine Serbian civilians near Tuzla. A similar incident, 
fortunately without casualties, also took place in Gorazde. 
  Commenting on the newly created situation, Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, told the SRNA agency the 
following: 
  [Karadzic] ``Hiding behind NATO, the United States has come 
to the very edge of interfering in the civil war, and it is 
highly possible that some U.S. quarters will push the United 
States into a new Vietnam in Bosnia-Herzegovina. NATO is being 
used as an instrument for the United States to realize its aims 
and help the Muslim community in Bosnia. 
  ``Unfortunately, in addition to NATO, UN forces are 
increasingly frequently finding themselves fighting for the 
Muslims. We are asking the Nordic countries whether they 
authorized their battalion to attack Serbs and cause deaths 
among Serbian civilians. The families of these civilians will 
probably sue the Nordic countries and the United Nations. 
  ``We appeal to the United States to prevent its hawks from 
pushing it into a new Vietnam.'' 
  [Correspondent] Commenting on the start of the work of the 
international contact group, Dr. Karadzic said: 
  [Karadzic] ``We told the contact group that we doubt the 
success of its mission because they are not impartial. The 
mediator in this civil war must be absolutely impartial if he is 
to succeed. In this sense, we presented a memorandum to the 
contact group in which we drew their attention to the fact that 
the international community had based its most important 
decisions on the lies of Muslim propaganda and on fabricated 
reports that were completely different from what was happening 
on the ground. In our talks, we openly accused the 
international community represented by the contact group of 
bias.'' [Correspondent] Anti-Serbian activities are always a 
product of fierce anti-Serbian propaganda of the international 
media. The currently hot topics are Brcko, Doboj, and the 
corridor that links the Serbian republic with Serbia. Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, sharply warned the 
international community with regard to this. 
  [Karadzic] ``The atmosphere around Brcko is (?heating up) in 
the international community. Brcko has been in Serbian hands 
since the beginning of the war, and the Serbs are not attacking 
Brcko since Serbs live in Brcko. We warn the international 
community that we will not accept any change in the status of 
Brcko, because Brcko and the corridor are in fact of vital 
interest for the Serbian nation. No one should expect any 
letting up in this respect.''

  [Text] Leaders of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, led 
by Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council, 
visited the area of Rama and Uskoplje today. Zdenko Vranjes 
reports: 
  [Vranjes] The need to strengthen the institution of the 
law-governed state and to suppress crime and smuggling in 
Herceg-Bosna was the focus of attention of the talks between the 
political leaders of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and 
civilian and military authorities of the Rama and Uskoplje 
municipalities and the priests of Rama monastery. It was 
emphasized that the passage of humanitarian and other convoys 
should be made more orderly. All convoys for Bosnia pass 
through Rama and Uskoplje. Their chaotic passage causes even 
greater and more dangerous disorder, robberies, and attacks by 
rebel groups, it was said at the talks. 
  The implementation of the Washington agreement was discussed 
at the session of the Croatian Democratic Union municipal 
committee and the command of the Ante Starcevic Brigade from 
Uskoplje. More work needs to be done on the border delineation 
between the cantons, it was stressed. 
  Zubak reiterated that the Croatian people have truly 
accepted 
the Washington agreement as a step toward peace. He described 
Alija Izetbegovic's letter [to Tudjman] yesterday as an attempt 
to shift to the Croatian people the blame for the lack of 
readiness to implement the Washington agreement. 
  Zubak said the Croatian representatives will not allow the 
Croatian people to be deceived. They will not allow certain 
circles among the Muslim people to establish a unitary 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by bypassing the essence of the Washington 
agreement. Such attempts can be detected in the demands by 
Muslim representatives for both the president of the federation 
and the prime minister to be Muslims. We will not accept this, 
for such demands have no basis in the constitution of the new 
federation, Zubak said.

<F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>
  [Text] Why has Croatian President Franjo Tudjman still not 
paid a visit to Sarajevo, even though President Izetbegovic has 
asked him on two occasions. Is the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] behind this? Are UNPROFOR generals preventing the 
Croatian president's visit to Sarajevo and the forming of the 
Croat-Bosnian federation? The question is not entirely 
unfounded, and here is why. During a recent interview for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television, in the course of a 
private, very engaging conversation, and in response to my 
question why he still has not visited Sarajevo, the Croatian 
president literally said: You have to ask UNPROFOR why I still 
have not been to Sarajevo -- therefore, firsthand information 
from the highest place in Croatia. Moreover, it is also 
possible to hear the following on the Croatian political scene: 
Now that they have tragically solved the fate of Gorazde, 
UNPROFOR generals may be [words indistinct] and we can expect 
all kinds of things from them, even the prevention of a 
normalization of relations between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  However, there is yet another question to which it is 
currently impossible to get an answer in Zagreb. Why has the 
Croatian media published an AFP report on President 
Izetbegovic's latest letter once again inviting President 
Tudjman to visit Sarajevo? Why was there no public statement 
from the presidential palace, which is the usual procedure? Was 
the letter intended only for Dr. Tudjman's private perusal, 
which is how a Croatian opposition member picturesquely 
commented on this. Is it really only UNPROFOR that is 
preventing Tudjman's visit to Sarajevo, or is there a lack of 
goodwill in the presidential palace?

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] Karadzic's terrorists continued attacks on the 
Bihac district in the last 24 hours. The defenders on the Bihac 
section of the front, the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, and the 
Bosanska Krupa and Buzim areas are constantly being attacked 
with anti-aircraft weapons and heavy machine guns. They shelled 
indiscriminately the front lines of defense and civilian targets 
with 82-mm and 120-mm mortars several times during the night. 
  Members of the Kladusa paramilitary army did not keep still 
either. Their artillery in Golubovici was particularly active. 
They shelled farmers working in the fields. They inflicted 
substantial damage and killed a large number of cattle in the 
villages around Todorovo and Varoska Rijeka. 
  They also carried out mortar and gun attacks and tried to 
provoke infantry attacks on other lines of separation. The 
increasing rift in Abdic's private army is illustrated by the 
fact that they have recently been carrying out mobilizations in 
Velika Kladusa, particularly for the police force. Out of 800 
people invited to join the force, only two reported.

constantly attacking the village of Sivsa, where there are 
several thousand residents. In the region of Cerovic and 
Omerovo Guvno, the enemy is regrouping large number of troops 
and hardware, which is a sign that a new offensive is being 
prepared. Let us hear a report: 
  [Ceric] A general danger alarm is in force in the villages

  [Text] [Studio announcer] President of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic today visited 
the free Brcko territory. On his tour of this commune, 
President Izetbegovic was accompanied by Army General Rasim 
Delic, Commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 2d Corps Hasim 
Sabic, and (Izet Hadzic), president of the Tuzla Commune's local 
government. Hamid Deronjic reports. 
  [Begin Deronjic recording] The distinguished guests were 
received by the highest civilian and military representatives of 
the Brcko Commune, while Colonel Ramiz Kljakic, commander of the 
legendary 108th Motorized Brcko Brigade, acted as host to 
President Izetbegovic. Immediately upon arrival in our commune, 
President Izetbegovic expressed the wish to visit the forward 
front lines, [words indistinct]. Touring the forward front 
lines of the fiercest front in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President 
Izetbegovic particularly stressed the high morale of the members 
of the 108th Motorized and 108th Infantry Brcko Brigades and 
accentuated the well organized coexistence of Muslims and Croats 
in our commune. The manner of organizing mutual life of Muslims 
and Croats in the Brcko Commune will probably serve as a model 
and example throughout our young state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
President Izetbegovic stressed. 
  Army General Rasim Delic reiterated that after the ugly 
experience of Gorazde and the international community's 
impotence in restraining the crazed Serbian aggressor, we must 
primarily base our struggle on our own potential and strength, 
and must create an impenetrable fortress of the remaining free 
parts of our state, which will be the basis for the further 
liberation of the territory under chetnik control. Brcko is the 
key to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and for our part, we shall 
do everything to see that preparations for the final showdown 
with the Chetniks proceed in the best possible way. We have 
nothing to fear because in these decisive moments of the war for 
a free and independent Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Presidency, the 
government, and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Command will help, 
added General Delic. 
  After touring the forward front lines, the delegation 
visited 
several places in the free Brcko territory. The visit ended 
with a chat with the wounded and the seriously and slightly 
wounded veterans of the legendary 108th Motorized Brcko Brigade, 
who were presented with appropriate awards. [end recording]

  OFFICE FOR PRIVATE BALANCE SHEETS: An office to review the 
balance sheets of private individuals has recently been created 
at Shkoder Municipality. This office will verify the profits of 
private individuals and will prevent their abuse regarding state 
obligations by presenting false balance sheets to the Tax 
Department. Many private firms and enterprises have ensured 
illegal profits in this way. Although over 100 private firms 
and enterprises are operating in Shkoder, only 20 of them have 
so far presented their balance sheets to the newly-created 
office. (Tirana ATA in English 1112 GMT 24 Mar 94) 
  GREEK COMPANY TO INVEST: The Durres Tobacco Factory has 
recently resumed production of Diamanti blended cigarettes. One 
hard pack of Diamanti costs 30 leks and a soft pack costs 27 
leks. Representatives of Durres Factory and a Greek firm have 
recently held talks on the production of Papastratos, a Greek 
brand. A general agreement has been reached on the conditions 
of a $2 million investment to be made in the near future by the 
Greek firm. After receiving the Greek capital, the Durres 
Factory will expand its production with new kinds of cigarettes 
of higher quality. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 28 Mar 94) 
  EU CREDITS: The Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) 
Foundation, which has long been active in Albania, is expected 
to increase its credit line for the promotion of business twice 
over that of the previous year. Gabriel Lasku, director of the 
Northern-Central Regional Agency in Lac, stated that this year 
the European Union (EU) will provide credits of 3 million ECU to 
stimulate the transition from small to medium enterprises. 
Credits of $10-15,000 were granted to small enterprises last 
year, while this year the credit limit will be raised to $30,000 
for medium enterprises. The credits for this year will be 
distributed to all SME Foundation agencies in Albania in 1994, 
with more rapid distribution in the second half of the year. 
The less developed areas, such as those in the far north, will 
be given preference in the distribution of credits. The number 
of people to be assisted this year will be greater than the 15 
who benefited from the program last year. (Tirana ATA in 
English 1014 GMT 30 Mar 94) 
  EUROPEAN COMMISSION GRANT: An EU spokesman said that the 
European Commission has proposed that the European Union grant a 
financial assistance to Albania and Moldova for economic reform 
programs. The European Commission proposed 35 million ECU aid 
for Albania to resettle its balance of payments. To be 
effective, the aid should be approved by the European Parliament 
and the EU Council of Ministers. Last year, Albania was given 
the first aid of this kind worth 140 million ECU. (Tirana ATA 
in English 1204 GMT 31 Mar 94) 
  FUEL PROJECTS: The Mining and Energy Ministry reports that 
190 projects for the construction of fuel stations are held for 
approval, following adoption by the government of the Law on Gas 
Stations. Hill Mehilli, specialist in the Hydrocarbons and 
Energy Department, told ATA that out of 190 projects that have 
so far been approved, some 100 of them are under construction, 
44 have been constructed, and 40 are already functioning. All 
the gas stations are private and they have so far employed 240 
workers, 5-6 in each station. (Tirana ATA in English 1007 GMT 2 
Apr 94) 
  ITALIAN JOINT VENTURE: The Albanian-Italian joint venture 
Sando-Co. was recently set up in Kucove. This joint venture is 
a result of the cooperation of the Detergent Factory in Kucove 
and an Italian company located in Milan. Thus, the production of 
detergents has increased to 800 tonnes per month, compared to 
200 tonnes in the previous period, which was due to the lack of 
raw material and the rise in detergent imports. Fitim Malaj, the 
Kucove factory's director, told an ATA reporter that "in May 
this year we expect to have a monthly rise of 300 tonnes. The 
quality of the material we produce and the price, which is 30-40 
percent lower than the imported one, make us hope for the rise." 
The Italian side will provide other equipment, spare parts, and 
a large boiler, as well as organizing the sale on the domestic 
market. (Tirana ATA in English 1020 GMT 3 Apr 94) 
  MERCHANT FLEET SHIPS AUCTIONED: The first eight merchant 
fleet ships have recently been put on auction. The Durresi, 
Liria, and Apolonia are among the ships that have been put up 
for auction. The auction will continue with 11 other ships. 
The first phase of the ships' privatization will end after the 
11 ships are sold. Some six high tonnage ships are expected to 
be sold in the second phase. The Durresi ships will be 
privatized based on a recently compiled study that will give 
priority to the fleet workers. In cases when any of the workers 
will take possession of a ship, the fleet will guarantee them a 
one-year term contract, with the right to renewal. (Tirana ATA 
in English 1022 GMT 3 Apr 94) 
  MODULAR CONSTRUCTION BEGINS: The construction of modular 
building units has begun in Shkoder on an experimental basis by 
a joint Albanian-Italian venture. The System- plast factory 
intends to use a process that will combine two sheets of 
galvanized steel with a core of thermal insulation. The 
material for the different size units has been furnished by the 
Italian partner. The units will be used as kiosks, tourist 
accommodation, petrol stations, and other purposes. The units 
produced by the joint venture in Shkoder will compete with 
imported units due to their comfort and attractive appearance. 
They are available with excellent lighting and sanitary 
systems. (Tirana ATA in English 1205 GMT 4 Apr 94) 
  TEXTILE MILL RESUMES PRODUCTION: After a suspension of 
several months, work has recently resumed in the Textile Mill in 
Tirana. The mill engineer told ATA that the mill is operating 
with only one shift, with approximately 1,000 workers. The 
average salaries the workers are expected to get this year will 
increase over 30 percent as compared to the average level of 
payments. The specialists say that the mill has undergone a 
large scale of amortization. Thus, efforts are being made to 
establish contacts with various firms for investments in this 
important project of the textile industry. The mill's 
privatization process will include its other factories of 
thread, woolen textiles, velvet, light clothing, and other 
linen. For many years the mill was named after Stalin, but 
after the democratic movements in Albania four years ago, its 
name changed simply into the Textile Mill. (Tirana ATA in 
English 1015 GMT 10 Apr 94) 
  EGYPTIAN FIRM BEGINS CONSTRUCTION: The Egyptian ambassador 
in 
Tirana reported that the powerful Egyptian firm Cato Aromatic 
will soon start to construct five food factories in Vore, near 
Tirana. The factories will produce cheese, macaroni, olive oil, 
and some cosmetics. Cato Aromatic came to Albania a year ago. 
The ambassador stated that the company has concluded the first 
stage of the project, the drainage system and land leveling. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1033 GMT 11 Apr 94) 
  SHAMPOO FACTORY STARTUP: The Gjirokastra Company recently 
produced the first two tonnes of shampoo that was proved to be 
of the same quality as that of the Johnson branch in Germany. 
After receiving the packing boxes and labels, ordered to be 
made abroad, the factory will soon mark its own products. The 
factory will have branches in Tirana, Vlore, and Shkoder. 
Robert Asqeriu, company's president, told ATA that the factory 
will produce detergents and cosmetics in the future. (Tirana 
ATA in English 1202 GMT 13 Apr 94) 
  CELLULAR PHONES: Cellular telephone, one of this century's 
achievements, will be installed in Albania as well. In an 
interview with RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, Minister of Transports and 
Telecommunications Fatos Bitincka stressed that the cellular 
telephone will be installed along with the traditional telephone 
network, thus contributing to a further modernization of 
telecommunications in Albania. Regarding the tender on the new 
facility, Mr. Bitincka said that they intend to complete the 
selection of offers within May or June, thus leaving enough time 
to work for the installation and install the cellular telephone 
by the end of 1994 or in early 1995. The number of telephone 
subscribers ranges from 3,000 to 5,000, but the new system will 
have greater possibilities to increase the number of 
subscribers. Both foreign and Albanian firms have so far been 
registered for the tender. Bitincka stated that the new 
telephone network is expected to cover 70 percent of the 
country's territory, giving priority to coastal and touristic 
areas. (Tirana ATA in English 1019 GMT 14 Apr 94) 
  AUSTRIANS TO RESTRUCTURE BANK: Erbert Stefic, president of 
one of the biggest Austrian banks, Raiffeisen Zentral Bank, 
declared before Austrian reporters that this bank will soon 
carry out a complete restructuring of the Albanian Bank of 
Agriculture, sources from this bank with its headquarters in 
Tirana told ATA. Mr. Stefic said that his bank will also make 
investments in Albania in the future. (Tirana ATA in English 
1026 GMT 14 Apr 94) 
  BANK GOVERNOR SPEAKS IN ROME: A meeting between 
representatives of the Italian-Albanian Bank and some 300 
entrepreneurs, mainly from the Rome province, has been recently 
held in Rome. The purpose of the meeting was to acquaint the 
Italian entrepreneurs with the possibilities of investments in 
Albania. Dylber Vrioni, governor of the Albanian Bank, took the 
floor at the meeting and mentioned several good existing 
priorities, such as the little geographical distance between 
Albania and Italy, the young age and cheap cost of the labor 
force, their training and education, and the open and liberal 
legislation for foreign investors. Mr. Vrioni also mentioned 
the building industry, transportation, tourism, and agriculture 
as the most profitable fields for investments. Many Italian 
entrepreneurs, including representatives from Coca Cola and 
Siemens, discussed at the meeting. The Siemens representative 
told those participants that Albania has greater possibilities 
for Italian investors than any other east European country. 
Such activities will continue to be held in Bari, Milan, 
Ancona, and Trieste. (Tirana ATA in English 1025 GMT 14 Apr 94) 
  EU DONATION FOR ENTERPRISES: Founded in 1992, the SME [Small 
&amp; Medium Enterprises] Foundation supports and encourages free 
initiative among the Albanian businessmen, who have just started 
their activity. The foundation, financed by the PHARE PROGRAM 
[Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], whose 
member Albania is since 1992, has given credits worth 1.1 
million ECU for 152 cases. The EU has approved credits worth 3 
million ECU and some 1.5 million ECU as technical assistance to 
the SME Foundation for the period 1994-1995. The program 
attaches priority to the manufacturing of goods, small 
factories, and the transition from small private enterprises to 
medium ones. So, the goal is to set up a new economic platform, 
the main part of which is occupied by agro-industry, 
craftsmanship, and small tourism, thus creating favorable 
conditions for investors. Some 200 Albanian different 
enterprises have been created so far. (Tirana ATA in English 
1011 GMT 16 Apr 94) 
  ALBANIAN-ITALIAN OIL VENTURE: An agreement has been signed 
for the creation of an Albanian-Italian joint venture named 
"Bertoli." Rakip Iljazi, the enterprise's director, told ATA's 
reporter that the enterprise will start its production in the 
second six months this year and will mainly produce olive and 
vegetable oil. Later, it will also produce soaps, apart from 
the installation of a milk production line. For the Albanian 
side, the agreement was signed by Minister of Agriculture and 
Food Hasan Halili and for the Italian side, by Rudolfo Bertoli. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 18 Apr 94) 
  NUMBER OF VEHICLES INCREASING: Compared with 1992, the 
number 
of vehicles circulating in Albania has doubled, while the 
situation of roads has remained the same or even worse. Based 
on these facts, the parliament decided to use 70 percent of the 
income levied from fines on traffic violations to improve the 
situation in this sector. The growing funds will be used to 
provide the traffic police with sophisticated means to prevent 
accidents. (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  GLASS FACTORY RESUMES PRODUCTION: The Glass Factory in 
Kavaje 
resumed production on 18 April. This was made possible due to 
the funds provided by the Enterprise Reconstruction Agency, 
which reconstructed four factory workshops, such as that of 
glass production, packing, and glass articles for every day use. 
The factory stopped its production due to old technology on 
July 1990 and later due to the economical difficulties of the 
transition period. Work has been going on for several months to 
make the operation start again. Glass products made in Albania, 
such as glass windows and articles of every day use, will soon 
be present in our market. All demands for glass products have 
so far been met by import and sometimes with high prices. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1810 GMT 19 Apr 94) 
  MORE FOOD: The Veterinary Office in Tirana municipality 
reports that during the first quarter of this year, the capital 
has been provided with 42,861 quintals of meat of various kinds, 
7,400 quintals of sausage, 16,855 quintals of cheese, 1,250 
quintals of powdered milk, and over 20 million eggs. Along with 
these imports, local food products, such as fresh meat, sausage, 
curd, cheese and other products have also been traded. At 
present, every Tirana citizen consumes on average four times 
more meat and its by-products, two to three times more cheese, 
two times more eggs, and 1.7 times more milk than during 
1980-1991. The increase of food articles in the market has been 
accompanied with the increase of the number of shops from 80 to 
over 220. (Tirana ATA in English 1209 GMT 20 Apr 94) 
  NEW AIRLINE SERVICE: The national company, Albanian 
Airlines, which has been operating for the past two years, has 
recently added Bologna to its schedule and will start a new 
service to Skopje in FYROM before the end of April. Founded as 
a joint venture with the Austrian company Tyrolean Airlines, 
Albanian Airlines initiated its service with flights to Zurich, 
Rome, and Munich. The company has recently concluded an 
agreement with Delta Airlines, which will enable it to provide 
services to various U.S. states. The airline's management is 
mainly Albanian and Canadian, and the fares are favorable for 
Albanians. Feliks Baci, the company director, said to ATA that 
"in the future we plan to introduce larger and faster 
turbo-powered aircraft, and in May we will introduce flights to 
Istanbul as well." (Tirana ATA in English 1212 GMT 23 Apr 94) 
  FOREIGN TRADE EXPANDING: The economic opening of Albania is 
evident in the increase and expansion of trade activity with 
almost all countries in the world. Its export indexes for 1993 
amounted to 11.344 billion leks, and the highest level was 
registered in October last year, to the tune of 1.350 billion 
leks. The value of imports in the previous year was 58.177 
billion leks. If we compare the export of certain products, such 
as minerals, chemicals, plastic materials and their by-products, 
it emerges that their value is about 2.5 times lower than the 
value of the import of the same articles. The export of 
electricity is worth nearly 492 million leks, that of tobacco 
about 650 million leks, and the import of cigarettes is about 
299 million leks. The export to countries of Eastern Europe was 
1,945.383 billion leks, while goods worth 44,577.827 billion 
leks were exported to European Community member countries. To 
the OECD member countries, the commodities exported from Albania 
have been to the amount of 48,055.056 billion leks and to East 
European countries 8,276.363 billion leks. (Tirana ATA in 
English 0800 GMT 24 Apr 94) 
  COOPERATION WITH GERMANS: The interest of German companies 
to invest in Albania has been increasing. Since 1992, many 
Albanian-German joint ventures have been created in Albania. The 
"El Frigo," "Transalbania," "Gerberc-Butrint II," "Albania Bau 
Handel ShPK," "Arta" have an initial capital worth $5.812 
million, of which $5.553 million invested by German companies 
and $259,000 by Albanian companies. The German companies are 
taking special interest in the energy and mining sectors. 
Agreements are expected to be signed soon between the Albanian 
Electroenergy Corporation and the energy company "Preussen 
Elektra," an affiliate of a major German concern. The Institute 
of Geo-Sciences of Hannover has allocated a fund of DM35 million 
for the mine in northern Bulqize, and 85 percent of it has 
already been furnished. Of great importance for the development 
of this industry in Albania is the German offer represented by 
BSE with three partners -- Sachtleben Bergban GmbH, Mannesmann 
Anlagenban GmbH, and Metallgesellschaft AG -- which have 
requested cooperation with the Albkrom company as a joint 
venture, something that will be realized through a tender. 
(Tirana ATA in English 0804 GMT 24 Apr 94) 
  FOREIGN INTEREST IN BEER PRODUCTION: While the Beer Factory 
in Tirana has resumed its production after three years of 
suspension, some well-known foreign firms have presented their 
cooperation projects to the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food. The foreign firms -- the German "Bramburger," the Italian 
"Peroni," and the Greek "Pheninger" -- are the first to have 
presented their cooperation projects and studies. Minister of 
Agriculture and Food Hasan Halili told ATA that "we have offered 
these firms cooperation with beer factories in Tirana, Korce, 
and Vlore (the latter is under construction)." Mr. Halili said 
that "after examining all the projects, the specialists will 
decide on the most profitable offer. (Tirana ATA in English 
0806 GMT 24 Apr 94) 
  FREIGHTER SERVICE: The Tyrsus freighter of the joint company 
Duval Line of the Albanian Merchant Fleet and the Italian 
company Baund began service recently. The freighter will operate 
from Durres to Vasto, a port in the eastern shore of central 
Italy, and from Durres to Bari. The freighter is hired and used 
by an Albanian crew and has a capacity of 600 passengers, 30 
trucks, and 48 cars. The 10 freighters sailing from Durres port 
have belonged to foreign firms so far. For the first time, half 
of the freighter's income, apart from port taxes and other 
services, will go to the Albanian side. This company, in 
competition with other freighters, will operate with low 
tariffs. (Tirana ATA in English 0814 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  PRICE OF STEAM: The price of steam will now be set by the 
productive enterprises themselves. Under a government decision, 
steam-production enterprises, which are still free of 
competition in this field, will not be allowed to abuse their 
power to set the steam price. This right will be given to 
enterprises with a maximum profit up to 10 percent, fixed by the 
electro-energy corporation. Specialists state that the 
liberalization of coal and solar energy prices, the increase in 
the prices of acid and spare parts, as well as the increase in 
workers' salaries influence the increase in steam costs. They 
confirm that the previous prices of steam, set in November 1992, 
have been at the expense of the Electro-Energy Corporation, 
which today is unable to meet the development needs with its own 
resources. The price of technological steam is almost the only 
price that has not changed since the end of 1992. (Tirana ATA 
in English 0817 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  ALBCHROME TO BE JOINT VENTURE: The firms "Buero Fuer Social 
und Entwicklungsmanagement" from Germany, "Mecolis Corporation," 
a group of Anglo-American firms, "Fucineti" from Italy, and an 
Italo- Japanese group are the four firms selected from a tender 
that the Albchrome Corporation, the only one in this field in 
Albania, will hold soon for the creation of a joint venture. 
Authorized sources of this corporation told ATA that, after a 
careful selection by Albchrome and its U.S. financial, 
technical, and juridical counselors, the tender envisages 
re-evaluating the four proposals from the technical, financial, 
and juridical angles until the end of April. The negotiating 
group and leading board of the Albchrome Corporation will chose 
the firm to continue negotiations for the creation of the joint 
venture. A draft-agreement for the creation of this joint 
enterprise, which is already drafted by the U.S. counselors and 
Albchrome specialists, will regulate further negotiations. 
Hence, a joint venture is expected to be created for the 
extraction and processing of Albanian chrome, which is renowned 
in the world market for its quality. (Tirana ATA in English 
1001 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  FLOUR FACTORY RESUMES PRODUCTION: After a four-year 
suspension due to damage, the Flour Factory in Tirana became 
active again after one year of reconstruction and reequipment 
with modern technology. The factory is fitted with Turkish-made 
Orkimsen machinery. Its equipment cost $1.4 million, and the 
total value of the factory reconstruction cost 56 million leks, 
amounts made available from the Albanian state budget. It is 
assumed that the factory will later work in three shifts, 
gradually reemploying first 80 and then 120 workers. The 
factory accomplishes four processes automatically with a daily 
capacity of 150 tonnes of flour, a production three times higher 
than before. The high standard production of several kinds of 
flour is destined for the Bread and Macaroni Factory, as well as 
private bakeries in the capital and its neighborhood. (Tirana 
ATA in English 1003 GMT 25 Apr 94) 
  HEALTH SERVICE FUNDS: Saimir Kadiu, director of the Economic 
Department in the Ministry of Health and Environmental 
Protection, told ATA that a fund of 4.934 billion leks has been 
allocated for the health service in 1994. Kadiu said that this 
budget marks a 35 percent increase compared to last year. 
Salaries represent 44 percent of this budget, still low if 
compared to the salaries of the health workers in the developed 
countries, which represent 70 percent of the budget. In this 
budget, priority is given to the problem of ensuring medicines, 
a fund of 534 million leks, representing 35 percent of the 
budget. With the privatization of pharmacies, demands for 
medicine were somewhat satisfied, but offers declined because of 
the very high prices of medicines in relation to the income of 
the population. The Ministry of Health intends to resolve this 
social problem, therefore the pharmaceutical network is assumed 
to be heterogeneous. A fund of 510 million leks has been 
allocated to the Tirana University Hospital Center. About 58 
million leks have been put at the disposal of the Maternity Home 
of Tirana, 48 million leks to psychiatric hospitals, and 1.3537 
billion leks to district hospitals. Another fund of 1.862 
billion leks has been allocated for health institutions, 
out-patient clinics, dental clinics, health centers, children's 
centers in villages, and the hygienic-epidemiologic sector. A 
fund of 160 million leks has been allocated to nurseries; a fund 
of 300 million leks to investments for the necessary health 
equipment and apparatuses. Kadiu states that taking into 
account the present needs of the Albanian health service, the 
budget is not yet sufficient. (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 2 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Muslim army 
commander, Gen. Rasim Delic on Monday confirmed that the Muslim 
side was preparing an offensive on the Serbs in the area of 
Brcko, a town in the northern part of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Gen. Delic, who toured together 
with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic Muslim units on the 
front south of Brcko, said that `the Brcko front was the key to 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,' according to Muslim-held Radio 
Sarajevo. 
  Gen. Delic confirmed that preparations were under way for a 
Muslim offensive at Brcko on the corridor which links the 
western and eastern parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.), 
and set out, `we have nothing to wait for, and we will launch a 
decisive reckoning with Serb forces for the [word indistinct] of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in that section of the front.' Gen. Delic 
said in a meeting with the local Muslim commanders that `the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina (Muslim) presidency and government will do 
everything for preparations for the offensive to be completed 
successfully.' 
  R.S. military sources have more than once in the past 
several 
days said that the Muslim side is preparing a large-scale 
offensive operation in the Brkco region with a view to cutting 
off the corridor. The same sources said that, as part of the 
preparations, Muslim military authorities first carried out 
massive mobilization in Sarajevo and then pulled out over 10,000 
troops from the city and sent them across Mount Igman to central 
and northern Bosnia. However, foreign media have been accusing 
the Serbs of massing troops around Brcko, and the U.S. 
Government is considering initiating an emergency action in the 
U.N. Security Council for the adoption of a resolution on 
intervention of NATO forces in case of armed conflicts between 
Serbs and Muslims in the Brcko region, which would be a further 
instance of the U.N. siding with the Muslims. 
  Commander of the U.S. military base in Frankfurt, Gen. 
Rolanger arrived in Sarajevo on Monday and met with Muslim 
Presidency member Ejup Ganic, Radio Sarajevo said and set out 
that no details of the talks had been disclosed.

  [Text] Doboj, May 2 (TANJUG) -- Strong Moslem artillery 
attacks on Teslic, Serb-held town in northern Bosnia, on Monday 
caused huge material damage, Bosnian Serb army sources have 
said. The Moslems also launched mortar and infantry attacks on 
Serb settlements and positions close to Doboj and in the region 
of Mt. Trebava and infantry and artillery attacks in the area of 
Mt. Ozren (all in northern Bosnia) the sources said. The 
Bosnian Serb army was forced to strongly respond to the attacks, 
it was said. Four civilians, wounded in Sunday's artillery 
shelling of Doboj which killed four civilians, are out of 
danger, the Bosnian Serb army said. 
  The Doboj Serbs have over the past month been under constant 
Moslem fire which killed many civilians, but the shelling of 
this town fails to draw the attention of the world public and of 
the U.N. Protection Force. The Moslem offensive in northern 
Bosnia aims to cut the corridor which links the eastern and 
western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS). On Sunday and 
Monday NATO planes have constantly been flying over Bihac 
(western Bosnia) thus encouraging the Moslems to mount mortar 
and infantry attacks on Serb positions, the Bosnian Serb army 
sources warned. 
  On Monday the Moslems opened anti-aircraft and sniper fire 
on 
Bosnian Serb army positions in the upper parts of the Neretva 
River valley, while the regular Croatian army units launched 
mortar attacks on the Bosnian Serbs near trebinje (southern 
Bosnia), it was said.

  [Text] The situation in Gorazde remains unchanged. The 
chances of the aggressor moving outside the 3-km zone on the 
right bank of the Drina River are slim. UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] has not set its points in that area again today. 
Instead of performing the duties for which they have been sent, 
the UN soldiers are often guzzling with the chetniks. Twelve 
thousand people are still waiting for things to move from the 
standstill and to at least move from the 3-km zone to their 
burned homes.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 2 (TANJUG) -- It was much easier to 
sign than implement the Washington agreement on a Croat-Muslim 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to Radio Free 
Europe. The radio said in a commentary that Bosnian Muslim 
President Alija Izetbegovic had sent two letters to Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman urging him to salvage the Washington 
agreement. 
  A letter of a similarly dramatic contents has been sent to 
Tudjman by Izetbegovic's adviser Slobodan Lang, who warned on 
returning to Sarajevo from Herzegovina that Muslim-Croat 
relations were near a breaking point and the Washington 
agreement would cave in unless something was done, according to 
Radio Free Europe. The Bosnian Croats and Muslims, who have 
been engaged in fierce mutual clashes since the beginning of the 
year, fighting for territories in Herzegovina and central 
Bosnia, have signed the agreement on a common federation under 
strong pressure from the United States. 
  So far, none of the dates set in the Washington agreement 
have been met, according to the Radio Free Europe commentary, 
which specified that major disagreements existed over personnel 
issues, primarily the office of president. The Bosnian Croats 
request that the first president of the federation be a Croat, 
but are ready to accept as a compromise that the post go to 
Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic but under no 
condition to Izetbegovic, whose candidacy has already been put 
up by the Muslim side. 
  The Radio Free Europe commentary said that Croatian media 
were again presenting the Bosnian Croat state Herzeg-Bosna as a 
legal political formation of the rank of a state. The 
commentary said a reflection of the volatile relations between 
the Croats and Muslims was the recent blowing up of a mosque in 
the centre of Livno. It quoted the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS as 
saying that the Muslims in Livno, a town in western Herzegovina, 
insist that they have been living far worse since the Washington 
agreement has been signed, that the Croat troops are forcing 
Muslims to perform various degrading jobs, and are stealing 
cattle, money and tractors in the nearby villages. The Muslims 
were also quoted as saying that they were subjected to greater 
harassment now and that they wanted an integral Bosnia. 
  The Radio Free Europe commentary said that representatives 
of 
the local Croat authorities in Sarajevo, which are loyal to 
Izetbegovic, had visited a number of foreign embassies in Zagreb 
to warn that the Washington agreement was definitively being 
torpedoed. According to the commentary, the local Croatian 
authorities in Sarajevo have warned that attempts are being made 
at introducing an internal order different from that defined in 
the adopted constitution, that no steps are being taken 
whatsoever for the return of the displaced persons, and that war 
crimes are being denied or minimized.

<F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Garmaz: "Where Are the Politicians </F>
Headed?"] 
  [Text] Leo (23 July to 22 August) -- "These persons 
of pronounced sincerity and an open character face indifference 
and internal conflicts in this period. There will be unplanned 
costs. Perhaps an unpleasant visit in the near future. Lack of 
self-confidence will be more pronounced in this period. There 
will be illness because of poor diet. Have your eyes checked. 
Advice: POSTPONE TRAVEL!" 
  This is the horoscope of this period for those born under 
the 
sign of Leo. Since no one has been able to "travel" from 
Sarajevo for a long time now, the message of Dzevad Nogic, who 
writes the horoscope in the Sarajevo paper NARODNE NOVINE, seems 
meaningless. But.... 
  SARP -- SARAJEVSKI POTROSAC is the newspaper of consumers 
and 
users of services; the Consumers Association of Sarajevo is its 
founder and publisher. As stated in the introductory material, 
"although funds were lacking and the conditions were difficult, 
it has come out five times in a printing of 5,000 copies each, 
aimed exclusively at providing the best possible information to 
consumers and the public in the besieged city and in the 
struggle for survival." 
  And the reports to the "consumers and the public" are 
written 
in the conditional tense, like the news from the B-H Electric 
Power Company: "Should 70 megawatts be available, Sarajevo will 
have power every day, reduction will be limited, provided 
inhabitants of the new parts of the city do a better job of 
guarding transformer oil!" Or again an advertisement of the 
firm Marketi: "If the blockade is lifted from the city and the 
roads are opened, this firm wants to say that it will be able to 
supply foodstuffs to all the inhabitants of Sarajevo!" 
<H5>  Privileged Journalists </H5>
  Although the introduction to SARP -- SARAJEVSKI POTROSAC 
emphasizes the publisher's intention of making this newspaper 
independent one day, a real newspaper of Sarajevo's public and 
consumers, the two advertisements chosen at random do little to 
support that. 
  There is nowhere in the world today where it is such a 
privilege to be a journalist as in Sarajevo! Writing in the 
newspapers or publishing newspapers, even altogether "small 
ones," means exemption from military conscription, but also, and 
this is still more important to people in Sarajevo, the sole 
possibility for obtaining an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
press card with which it is possible to leave the city legally 
on aircraft of the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]. 
  Although some 30 newspapers are "coming out" in the city, it 
is impossible to speak at all seriously about the newspaper 
scene in Sarajevo. For a large number of journalists publishing 
the first issue of some new Sarajevo paper serves the sole 
purpose of obtaining a press card -- the only "exit visa" from 
surrounded Sarajevo. Most of these newspapers cease publication 
after the first or second issue, and their journalists, thanks 
to the press cards, become smugglers bringing goods every day 
from Ancona or Split to sell on the Sarajevo market.... 
  What the UNPROFOR press card is "worth in Sarajevo" is 
indicated by the fact that a large number of people are ready to 
pay even several thousand German marks for it; this is the value 
placed on it by the "black market." So the number of almost 600 
press cards issued in Sarajevo is not illogical at all in view 
of the circumstances. 
  So, "horoscopes" and "consumer advice" are not nonsensical 
at 
all: If a newspaper is to be published (and that is a condition 
for issuing a press card), it still has to be filled with some 
kind of content! 
<H5>  Paper From Humanitarian Aid </H5>
  One basic feature of all the papers being published in 
Sarajevo is the very difficult conditions for supply. "A month 
and a half ago, when we started our paper, we intended to put 
out the first serious regular political weekly in this country. 
But after we published two issues, problems arose with paper, 
and now we come out about every 10 or 12 days in a modest print 
run of a few thousand copies. The entire run is sold out the 
same day," Senad Avdic, editor in chief of the "weekly" BOSNA, 
relates. 
  "By and large there is no paper in Sarajevo, and what we 
manage to get comes mainly through humanitarian aid. 
OSLOBODJENJE, which in professional terms is the strongest 
newspaper firm in Sarajevo, has alone been able to secure a 
constant supply of newsprint through the UNHCR, and they are 
also the only ones who have managed to maintain daily 
publication," Senad Avdic explains. 
  The example of BH DANI, an occasional newspaper edited by 
Senad Pecanin, best illustrates how hard it is to keep up a 
publishing schedule when "impeding the newspapers for political 
reasons" is added to the chronic problem of the paper shortage. 
"The other day we published the issue sent to the printer's two 
months ago!" Pecanin says. The reason for that tardiness was a 
dispute over a photograph of Alija Izetbegovic taken in the 
vault of the National Bank of B-H just before going off to bed. 
The authorities also reproached us because of an article about 
"SDZ [Democratic Action Party] Democracy," which said: 
``Recently a successful young Sarajevo executive was offered the 
post of chairman of the executive committee of the assembly of 
Centar Opstina in Sarajevo. The end of the negotiations between 
the authorities and the executive went something like this: 
  `...But you would have to join.' 
  `Join what?' 
  `Well, the party.' 
  `Which party?' 
  `Is there more than one?''' 
  Such approaches by a majority of the leaders of the 
Democratic Action Party of B-H have now become a habit. Not only 
do other parties not exist for them (nor for Radio-TV B-H), but 
even government institutions, the B-H Army, the police, the 
universities, the Islamic Community, and the media, are 
beginning to be treated as support services of the SDA.... 
  Pecanin considers "his" newspaper entirely autonomous and 
independent of the government, by contrast with the papers that 
come out regularly, which he says are under the direct tutelage 
of the government, the SDA, the B-H Army, the Islamic Religious 
Community.... 
  His fellow journalists, on the other hand, say that BH DANI 
"fell from the sky and has nothing to do with reality." 
<H5>  Hairdos and Panties </H5>
  "BH DANI is more an informal magazine than a serious and 
relevant newspaper," says Senad Avdic, editor in chief of BOSNA. 
He backs up his statement with a quote from that newspaper: "At 
a time when the survival of B-H is in jeopardy, how can BH DANI 
be concerned with hairdos and panties?" 
  Senad Pecanin, however, explains that "his newspaper" only 
wants to preserve those "urban characteristics which 
distinguished Sarajevo" and he announces that the next issue 
(when it comes out) will run to 106 pages! His optimism is 
stimulated by the unceasing financial support reaching him from 
abroad. 
  LJILJAN, "the national political newspaper," is the complete 
opposite of BH DANI: 
  "We said every teravija and namaz 
[Muslim prayers], and we fasted. A miracle occurred on the 
seventh day of Koran Bajram. A stray sheep came to our door.... 
Thus we also had Korban!" The priority given to Islamic 
religious customs, the war rhetoric (headlines like "The Thunder 
of the Resistance Resounded to the Heavens" or "Punish Them, 
Almighty God" or again "I Am Proud of My Son Sehid") have 
resulted in a circulation of nearly 60,000! 
  Nevertheless, we should mention that Sarajevo is not the 
only 
place where the paper is printed and sold (Maribor, Frankfurt, 
Istanbul). Five thousand copies are distributed in the city 
itself. 
  It is of interest that LJILJAN began to come out in Zagreb, 
and then it had to move to Maribor because its distribution was 
banned. Asked why overnight they began to call the Croats 
ustashi, Nedzad Laric, one of the editors, visibly flustered, 
replied: "Well, I had to do something to force my people to wage 
war and think with their own heads!" 
  But in spite of the "normalization of Croat-Muslim relations 
in Bosnia," he "never again wants to find a place for Ante Rosa 
nor Jadranko Prlic, nor..." in his paper. 
<H5>  Opposition Papers </H5>
  Fahrudin Radoncic, at one time correspondent in Podgorica 
and 
Sarajevo for DANAS in Zagreb and the spokesman for Sefer 
Halilovic, the discharged chief of the general staff of the B-H 
Army, like most of his colleagues, wants BOSNJACKI AVAZ to take 
a solid place of its own under the sun in Sarajevo media space. 
However, even Radoncic cannot print his newspaper in Sarajevo in 
a printing larger than a few thousand copies. 
  "In my judgment," Senad Avdic, BOSNA editor, said, "this 
newspaper could sell 60,000 copies in all of B-H without any 
problem at all. But even if we found that much paper, it would 
cost us about half a million marks!" 
  That is, just like every other commodity on the Sarajevo 
market, newsprint can be obtained exclusively through 
well-established smuggling channels. 
  Until the procurement of paper is normalized, and also until 
young professional journalists in Sarajevo mature, newspaper 
publishing will come down to more or less serious attempts which 
have yet to obtain professional confirmation and confirmation 
from the market. 
  For the present, one can only suspect that OSLOBODJENJE and 
VECERNJE NOVINE, the two daily papers, and BOSNA, LJILJAN, 
BOSNJACKI AVAZ, and BH DANI, which are occasional papers or 
future weeklies, have the best chance. 
  In the meantime, the papers that are coming out today, like 
SARAJEVO TIMES, BEHAR, ABC MAGAZIN, SARP, NARODNE NOVINE, and so 
on, will serve only as a cover for the true intentions of their 
founders. And also as evidence that there is no limit to human 
resourcefulness....

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dr. Fatmir Zanaj: "Is U.S. Policy Toward </F>
Albania Going To Change Now That Mr. Ryerson Is Leaving Our 
Country?"] 
  [Text] The BBC Albanian Section reports that Mr. William 
Ryerson, the U.S. ambassador to Albania, is due to be 
transferred from this country to take up another post. The 
question arises: Will this change bring any new tone in U.S. 
policy toward our small Balkan country? I think there is little 
reason to expect any U.S. policy change in this respect. It is 
a policy that has been conceived in detail by specialist 
personnel, and there is no reason why it should be lightly 
changed within two or three years. What is certainly due to 
change in the future is Albania itself and the Albanian people, 
who already have changed over the past four years, together with 
the Albanian realities and political parties. 
  With the establishment of diplomatic relations between our 
two countries, U.S. policy in Albania immediately appeared to be 
a consistent anti-communist policy aimed at speeding up the 
changes that had already begun in the 1988-89 period. It was 
also a policy of establishing a system of pluralist democracy 
and a capitalist market economy. 
  With all the means at the disposal of his profession, Mr. 
Ryerson has contributed to the destabilization of the last 
communist ruling party in Albania, and did the same thing 
against Fatos Nano's socialists in the run-up to the 22 March 
1992 elections, thus reflecting the official U.S. policy of 
temporary diplomatic mistrust of any democratic transformation 
of the reform- minded trend within the PPSH [Party of Labor of 
Albania] into a modern party of a social-democratic type, called 
afterward the PSSH [Socialist Party of Albania]. Another 
expression of this U.S. political stance was Ambassador 
Ryerson's appearances in public, side by side with the PDSH 
[Democratic Party of Albania], which at that time appeared to be 
the greatest and most determined anti-communist force in Albania. 
  The Albanian public today has a certain assessment of Mr. 
Ryerson's activities in Albania, but it is not a uniform one. 
Nevertheless, a considerable number of Albanians have long 
expressed a tendency to identify the PDSH with U.S. policy in 
Albania, and to identify Mr. Ryerson himself with the PDSH 
leaders when this party was in opposition, and also now that it 
is in power. 
  There seem to have been certain public factors -- especially 
those related to the run-up to the 22 March 1992 elections -- 
that prompted Albanians to reach such conclusions. The 
Albanians remember all too well, and they could not help 
mentioning several times afterward, Mr. Ryerson's declaration at 
a PDSH election rally in Korca, where he stated: "I wish all 
the socialists good health and unemployment." However, the 
Albanians are also wise enough to appreciate the criticism 
contained in a recent U.S. State Department report on human 
rights violations committed in this country by ruling government 
officials -- a report in which information provided by the U.S. 
Embassy in Tirana played its part. 
  Nevertheless, the identification of Mr. Ryerson with the 
present PDSH leaders -- whose prestige has been badly 
compromised because of the difficulties Albania is faced with in 
this transition period, and because of signs of wear and tear, 
incapability, and corruption in various segments of the PDSH 
state organs -- could negatively affect the friendly feelings 
that Albanians have toward the great and powerful U.S. democracy 
and toward the United States itself. Whereas the former 
President Alia masterfully succeeded in appeasing the anti-U.S. 
sentiments instilled in the Albanians' minds for decades by the 
communist regime, the identification of the present U.S. 
ambassador in Albania with the present PDSH and its ruling, 
discredited elite has had the reverse impact upon the Albanians' 
mixed feelings. Such a thing is in the interest of neither the 
great United States nor little Albania. Since Mr. Baker's visit 
to Tirana in spring 1991, ordinary Albanians have given ample 
proof that they are able to appreciate their friendship with the 
United States. 
  Mr. Ryerson has made a great contribution to the process of 
eradicating communism from Albania. He will therefore be 
remembered for a long time by the Albanian people. There will 
be pleasant memories of him, but also bitter ones, bearing in 
mind the tactics used to bring the former communists to their 
knees. Such tactics unleashed destructive anti-communist forces 
that gave vent to their frustrations by burning down and 
destroying factories, schools, cultural centers, farms, and so 
on. It is yet another "dark stain" on how the overwhelmingly 
majority of Albanians view the Western support for the PDSH to 
come to power. To some extent, this also applies to how the 
Albanians view the U.S. ambassador of that period. 
  With Mr. Ryerson's departure from Albania, one chapter in 
the 
evolution of U.S. policy in Albania is closed, and the new 
chapter will require a new ambassador. The foreign policy 
analysts will not have forgotten the reaction of the Albanian 
population against those who implemented such a policy thus far. 
From now on, it will be a matter of the consolidation of U.S. 
influence in Albania. The Albanian policymakers have to show 
themselves capable of respecting and defending Albania's 
interests first and foremost, and then the interests of her 
friends, be they small or great. 
  Naturally, the anti-communist U.S. policy is, in essence, 
not 
going to change. From this viewpoint, one can assume that it is 
the right-wing parties that will be the more privileged ones. 
However, Mr. Ryerson's visit to the PPSH headquarters to attend 
its press conference on 3 April 1994, among other things of 
significance, is symptomatic of the official U.S. policy of also 
opening up toward the left-wing parties, and perhaps at the same 
time an indication of the end of its "cold war" against the PSSH 
as a "former communist" party. The fact that some former 
communists today are leading the PDSH and the Albanian State is 
encouraging in this respect. Being a pro-European party, the 
PSSH has strived from the very beginning, and continues striving 
to build all kinds of links with the United States at all 
levels. The Albanian socialists have eventually recognized the 
fact that a pro-European policy also presumes a permanent U.S. 
presence in Europe and U.S. membership in a number of European 
political and military structures. The Albanian people are in 
need of powerful friends, especially those near them, but 
without ever refusing the friendship of those who are far off. 
Now that the cards on the Balkan table are being reshuffled, 
all Albanians, regardless of their persuasion or where they 
live, value their friendship with the United States as a 
historic chance of achieving a fair solution to their national 
problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Extreme Solutions Intended"] </F>
  [Text] Prishtina, 29 Apr -- On 24 April, Serbian forces 
executed near the village of Miratoc the young Naim Bajrami from 
the village of Llashtice [Vlastica] in Gjilan [Gnjilane] 
Commune. Witnesses who saw the corpse say that Naim Bajrami was 
killed by a single shot in the back, that his jaw was broken, 
and that he had facial injuries. The victim and his family had 
been recently wanted by the Serbian police on the pretext of a 
search for weapons. 
  A statement issued by the Party for Democratic Action in 
Presovo states that a delegation of this party went to the site 
of the murder and discovered that Naim Bajrami had been killed 2 
km from the border with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], while, at about 1000 on the same day, a 
Serbian soldier had fired on the minor C.M. from the village of 
Miratoc. It is now known that the young man wanted to leave 
Kosova because he and his family had been harassed for a long 
time by the Serbian police on the pretext of collecting weapons. 
  It is striking that this murder is a sequel to the torture 
and persecution being carried out against the Albanians in 
Kosova, especially in recent weeks. However, this murder has 
another significance. Of the five murders commited by Serbian 
forces in the last two months, four of them, including the most 
recent, have been in border areas. Two Albanian citizens were 
killed in the border zone of Kosova and Albania. An inhabitant 
of Han i Elezit [Djeneral Jankovic] was killed in the 
Kosova-Macedonian border zone. The most recent case, the murder 
of Naim Bajrami, took place in the Serbian-Macedonian border 
zone. These murders are a clear sign of the increased military 
presence of Serbian forces in Kosova's border areas with Albania 
and Macedonia. 
  The murders and the increased fortifications of the Serbian 
forces occurred at the time when NATO sent the Serbs an 
ultimatum to lift the blockade of Sarajevo and when Greece began 
to increase the frequency of incidents on the Greek-Albanian 
border. The aggressiveness of Serbian forces also increased in 
these areas at the time of the NATO ultimatum to lift the 
blockade on Gorazde and other UN-protected areas in Bosnia. 
  The inhabitants of Zhur [Zur], Vermice [Vrmica], and Han i 
Elezit have been continually mistreated by Serbian military 
forces in recent weeks. Belgrade has so far not made the 
slightest mention of the murder of Naim Bajrami, while directly 
blaming Albania for the murder of two Albanian citizens a few 
days ago at Morine near Gjakove [Djakovica], accusing Albania of 
being a factor of "regional instability." 
  It is evident that the murders of the two last months have 
been concentrated on border areas with the intention of sending 
a clear warning to the Albanians that, while they live under 
torture and continual punishment in Kosova, entrances and exits 
to this area are under strict control. It is not difficult to 
see that Belgrade now intends to confront the Albanians with 
extreme solutions, and with the dilemma of acquiescence or 
rebellion.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Xh. Rexhepi: "Serbian Nostalgia for the </F>
(Non)Exploitation of Kosova"] 
  [Text] Despair over the failure to achieve a "Serbian 
paradise" and the rapid fall from fashion of the "Vozd" brand of 
perfume are now very evident not only among the Serbian 
leadership but in its forcibly installed regime in Kosova. The 
euphoria of the mass dismissals of Albanian workers, hailed as a 
great victory for united Serbia, was accompanied by the 
similarly large-scale incorporation of Kosova collectives into 
Serbian firms. It was realized at the time that these mergers 
were to the detriment of the Kosovar economy and were carried 
out not only out of political interests but because of narrow 
personal interests of certain Serbian individuals and circles. 
The fact that even officials of the Serbian-installed regime in 
Kosova have begun to talk about such damage best indicates the 
alarming situation. 
  This is why certain officials of the Serbian regime in 
Kosova 
are talking with nostalgia and are here and there even 
criticizing the Serbian Government, blaming it, for instance, 
for the massive losses suffered by Trepca in one year. Their 
nostalgia waxes even greater when they hark back to days of 
yore, when Trepca alone earned almost $100 million a year from 
exports of its minerals and products, when Feronikel similarly 
earned $100 million a year, when the Tube Factory in Ferizaj 
[Urosevac] earned $50-60 million on foreign markets, followed by 
the shock absorber factory, the wallpaper factory, and the 
textile and timber industries, and so on. 
  The tears of these Serbian officials over such hard currency 
sums, which under bankrupt Serbia's current circumstances are 
breathtaking, not only testify to the failure of their violence 
against the Kosovar economy, but also indicate a certain regret 
for the time when Albanian workers, especially in Trepca, 
labored for miserable wages that were much lower than in other 
areas of the former Yugoslavia. The sweat of Kosovar workers 
was soaked up by the funds of exporting and re-exporting firms 
in Belgrade, while the Trepca miners and metalworkers took their 
pensions without roofs over their heads and with empty pockets. 
  However, this does not worry this regime, which is 
subjecting 
Albanian workers, like all the Albanian population in occupied 
Kosova, to continuous violence; what worries the regime a great 
deal is the lack of interest among the invited Serbian colonists 
to work in the mines, foundries, and factories of Trepca, in the 
furnaces of the power stations, in Feronikel, or elsewhere. The 
fact that the few experts that were brought with such a fanfare 
from Belgrade and other Serbian cities are now starting to run 
away from the "Serbian paradise" in Kosova adds to their 
anxiety. These experts did indeed live and earn well for a time 
at the expense of the reserves and funds created by the Albanian 
workforce, but, now that these are exhausted, they have started 
to go back to where they came from. 
  Thus the Serbian officials installed in Kosova moan and 
groan 
that the resources of Kosova are not being exploited, expecting 
that they can thereby explain themselves to their "patrons" and 
to workers whom they do not even allow to enter the factory 
yards, let alone the factories themselves. It seems that 
Avram's magic dinars, which Serbian officials swear by, will not 
be able to open factory gates in Kosova. As consolidation for 
this, the Serbian parliament this year earmarked the sum of 
3,600,000 dinars for the budget of the Serbian-installed regime 
in Kosova (or Kosovo-Metohija, as the Kosovo-Polje-types like to 
call it), approving this without a single comment or amendment, 
not even from the delegates from Kosova. This was not because 
they thought the sum was enough, but apparently because they 
reasoned, "Why should we wear ourselves out and waste time in 
front of the television cameras over such a sum, which we can 
gain in a single day of police operations inspecting (and 
plundering) Albanian firms in Kosova?" 
  On the other hand, the Serbian Government predicts for the 
"Kosmet-ites" a Nis-Prishtina-Peje highway, which will be 
connected with Podgorica and the Adriatic coast by a tunnel 
underneath Cakor. The fortune-tellers say that this will rescue 
the Dukagjin plain from Albanization. Meanwhile, while the plum 
brandy glasses clink over this magnificent project, Serbian 
television has inaugurated another plan with a distinctive 
Serbian "Kasikara" perfume, which is expected to be noisily 
welcomed in international business circles. At least, this is 
what its designers claim. In order not to leave our respected 
readers in bewilderment, we remind them that a "kasikara" is a 
hand grenade, a product of the Serbian arms industry, which 
Serbian soldiers have used extensively in their appalling 
aggression against the Croats and Bosnians. 
  It is with this sort of marketing and logic that they want 
to 
conquer the world market, thus securing hard currency for the 
"Serbian paradise" in Kosova, which for the "Kosovo-Polje-types" 
of "Postojbina" now sleeps deep under Cakor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, general deputy chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Janos Kecskes Szekely; place 
and date not given: "No One Has Nostalgia for the Regime in 
Hungary"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Szekely] If the current 
forecasts are correct about the 36-percent chance of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] then you will have so many 
deputies in parliament that you can again establish a one-party 
system in Hungary.... 
  [Szekerees] I very seriously think that it is certain that 
Hungary will not have a one-party system. In my view, some six 
to eight parties will be in Parliament. It is not a realistic 
alternative, either, that the government will have a one-party 
system. I expect that the mandates will be in proportion to the 
popularity of the parties, however, we will only find this out 
on 29 May. The MSZP will not come to power -- as you claimed -- 
when it comes to government, because governing is not the same 
as being in power -- power, fortunately, is divided. It has 
many actors and the government is not the only factor in power. 
Parliament, the president of the republic, the Constitutional 
Court, and publicity are similar kinds of tools. Therefore, I 
say that the MSZP will be one of the parties in government. In 
my view, Hungary will have a coalition government. Whatever the 
election results are, it is certain that a stable government 
that is able to operate can only be established in Hungary if it 
stands on the broadest possible political basis. 
  [Szekely] If membership in the government does not mean that 
someone possesses power then why do you attack the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] by saying that, in possession of the 
power, it has not done such and such things? 
  [Szekeres] Rather than saying that in possession of power, 
the MSZP says that the government's -- and not the MDF's alone 
-- performance was not good enough to entitle it to continue in 
government. The next government -- providing that the MSZP is 
in it -- will change mainly in the sense that it wishes to rely 
on expertise to a greater extent, including the state's expert 
teams and the social organizations, interest groups, and other 
professional organizations. In my view, it will change because 
governing will become predictable, therefore, people will be 
able to know in advance what the government will represent. 
Governing will also become more open, the government will be 
able to have a better dialogue with society. As a result of all 
this, governing can and will change. [passage omitted] 
  [Szekely] Are you really honest and predictable? 
  [Szekeres] I trust that we are and will remain so. 
  [Szekely] This is contradicted by the pragmatically 
demagogic socialist election program, in which the planned 
economic measures almost correspond to the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] type orthodox-liberal shock-therapy concept 
and will have exactly the opposite effect to the promises made 
to poor people on improving their living standards. Your 
planned tax changes will also affect people on low incomes the 
worst. You also promise things in your program that have 
already been achieved by the current government, for example 
curbing inflation. Where is the honesty here? 
  [Szekeres] I believe that we talk very honestly about what 
can be expected and what measures we will take. When we talk to 
people about our concept, we talk on the basis of this program 
and we do not make promises. I know that both the conservative 
and the liberal press has raised this criticism against us, but 
this is unfounded. We very honestly tell that we are facing a 
very difficult 18 months, so we even mention the length of time 
our planned measures will take to bring results. I believe that 
our program is not a liberal one. I do not even know what the 
term liberal economic policy means, I cannot interpret this in 
Central-Eastern Europe in a transitional society. I cannot see 
that it is liberalism that creates the similarities between the 
our economic program and that of the SZDSZ and the Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz]. I emphasize this because, 
surprisingly, economic research institutes pointed out that the 
Fidesz's and the MSZP's concepts are closest to each other, and 
not the SZDSZ's and the MSZP's. The reason is that the room for 
maneuver has become narrow. Whoever is in government, he will 
have very little room for maneuver. 
  [Szekely] If you are offering the same as the Fidesz or any 
other party then why should we elect you out of all the parties? 
  [Szekeres] I think that this has psychological conditions. 
I myself have been thinking about the reasons for the increase 
of our public support in the past 18 months. We have had some 
research done for us on this issue to see what people actually 
think about the MSZP. Three factors were emphasized, and our 
increased support is probably due to these factors. The first 
is that a view has emerged that the MSZP is an expert party. To 
put it more simply, they believe that the Socialists know what 
they want and they are good at their jobs. Another factor 
people emphasized was that we are a predictable party, 
therefore, it can always be known in advance what stance we 
would take on an issue. This makes us a little boring -- I 
admit this -- but this is a very important value for people in a 
transitional society like ours, which is in a flux. The third 
reason is that they consider us to be an open party because they 
say that they feel we are dealing with their problems. People 
have more faith in us than in other political parties for these 
three reasons. [passage omitted] 
  [Szekely] Perhaps even you did not believe four years ago 
that you would win the next elections. If the MSZP thinks in 
the long term, and if its governing will be the same kind of 
disaster for the country as the previous one, then what strategy 
do you have to survive even this? In other words, do you not 
think that this possible return is too early? 
  [Szekeres] Personally, I did not think four years ago that 
the MSZP's public support would increase to such an extent. I 
thought that this would take 10 to 12 years. I thought that the 
government or the liberal opposition would put up a better 
performance, therefore, I accept what you say. However, for a 
political party, if it feels responsibility for the country, it 
is not a good question whether it wishes to govern in a given 
situation. We have to consider whether, today, it is possible 
to form a stable government in Hungary that is able to operate 
without the MSZP. I think that it is not, because only an MDF, 
Christian Democratic People's Party, SZDSZ, and Fidesz 
cooperation could successfully counter us, but this would not be 
able to function. However, if we do not now take on the 
governmental role, who knows in what condition the country will 
be in two, three, or four years' time? Possibly much worse. 
Therefore, we have to accept the responsibility of government 
and we have to try to avoid losing people's confidence. The 
only method to achieve this is through complete openness.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Szajer, head of the National </F>
Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; 
place and date not given: "We Want a Government of Politicians, 
Not a Government of Bureaucrats"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] In view of your 
information to date, to what extent did you succeed in 
predicting the main trends of the election campaign? 
  [Szajer] Our strategy has been ready for a year, a strategy 
according to which a liberal center must be created in Hungary 
that can compete with the socialists and the conservatives from 
a position of power. A lot of things happened in one year and 
during the election campaign, but this strategy has stood the 
test of time. Thus, our predictions proved to be correct. 
  [Pinter] The present Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] 
is not identical with the Fidesz of one year ago. In your view, 
where are the changes? 
  [Szajer] First of all, our positions have changed. For a 
long time, the Hungarian public saw competition and 
confrontation between the coalition and the opposition parties. 
In the first months of 1993 one could already notice a decrease 
in the support of the current government parties and, thus, 
these forces will not achieve good results in the upcoming 
elections. A strong competition emerged among the opposition 
parties in the wake of this recognition. There were also 
internal causes behind this struggle. The Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] overcame its previous crisis and, as a result, 
it emerged as an offensive party. As for the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP], the public freed this party of the 
stigma of the post-communist party at about the same time. The 
revival of these two parties changed the internal relations 
between the opposition parties, and we can no longer start from 
the premise that the Fidesz is the only party that is constantly 
increasing its popularity. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Under what influence have you modified your views 
on national and religious matters in the past one year? 
  [Szajer] I cannot agree with the statement formulated in 
this question, because the Fidesz has not changed its position 
regarding national and religious matters. However, under the 
effect of previous attacks, we definitely had to change our 
communication, namely we informed the public much more 
frequently and in much more detail about our views. During our 
congress held in April 1993, Viktor Orban openly declared that 
the Fidesz is a national-oriented liberal party. For a long 
time, we thought that national commitment is so natural for us 
that there is no need to mention it separately. From the very 
beginning, the fate of the Hungarian nation and of the ethnic 
Hungarian minority living beyond our borders has been an 
indivisible element of our policy. Many people made use of the 
fact that we refrained from constantly declaring this, and many 
people tried to create the impression that the Fidesz is not 
interested in these matters. We could no longer tolerate this, 
and we put adequate emphasis on our position. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] What image does the cooperation of the Fidesz, the 
SZDSZ, the Agrarian Alliance, and the Liberal Civic Alliance 
Entrepreneurs' Party provide about the power of liberalism in 
Hungary? 
  [Szajer] Liberalism enjoys public support and basis in 
Hungary. It also has a task in Hungary, because we have to 
carry out a modernization here that actually creates a liberal 
bourgeois democracy. There are obvious and firm differences 
between the Fidesz and the SZDSZ, but common interests are the 
basis of every cooperation between political parties, including 
the cooperation between the Fidesz and the SZDSZ. If we are 
unable to preserve the unity of the liberal coalition, this 
might threaten the implementation of our long-term plans. The 
current struggle will decide the determining power on the 
Hungarian political arena for years, or even for decades. The 
SZDSZ was the strong liberal party in 1990, and it failed to 
come up with a strong liberal alternative against the 
conservatives despite the weak left at the time. Given its 
increased power, the Fidesz has a considerable responsibility in 
1994. If it fails to come up with a strong liberal alternative 
against the socialists despite the current weakness of the 
conservatives, liberalism will hardly become the power to 
determine the Hungarian policy in the long term. We must now 
become one of the constant and major players in the political 
rotation. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] Dominance means a determining force in the 
political jargon, but not an exclusive force. In your opinion, 
could a liberal-dominant coalition emerge now, a coalition also 
including the socialists? 
  [Szajer] Only if the socialist presence is totally 
insignificant. 
  [Pinter] In your opinion, could such a coalition emerge 
after the elections? 
  [Szajer] The election predictions do not show this. The 
socialists will most probably have more power than to agree to 
participate in such a coalition. Under these circumstances, the 
Fidesz does not regard the MSZP as a coalition partner. 
  [Pinter] What if the SZDSZ does regard them as such? 
  [Szajer] We cannot exclude this possibility either. 
However, in that case, no one should delude himself that he is 
a member of a so-called social-liberal coalition. In that case, 
a liberal party participates as a subordinate of a 
socialist-dominated government. During the change in the regime, 
the SZDSZ showed considerable firmness against the forces that 
are now making up the MSZP. SZDSZ members would probably find 
it rather difficult to accept such a change in direction. At 
its inception, the Fidesz was a strong anti-Communist party, but 
a civilized party that always took Hungary's future into 
consideration. We will definitely preserve this character of 
our party. If we gave up our intentions, we would become a 
valueless player in political life and we would morally 
disintegrate. We are not preparing for this; instead, we are 
preparing for a determining liberal role. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] In your opinion, what are the prospects of the 
parties of the present coalition? 
  [Szajer] They have a certain basis and, just as in 1990, 
they will again gather mainly votes on their lists. The 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP] will make it into Parliament, but only 
Jozsef Torgyan's Smallholders' Party has a chance. The 
conservative pole has become weak and it will not play a 
considerable role. According to our predictions, the liberals 
will govern and the conservatives and the socialists will be in 
opposition. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinter] In the case of a possible opposition role, how 
would the Fidesz assert its political responsibility? 
  [Szajer] The entire political program of the Fidesz relies 
on the fact that the SZDSZ gets into power. If this fails to 
materialize, from the first moment of our new opposition status, 
we will start preparing for the next elections, namely for 
governing. Our party's logic will not change, only our 
possibilities for implementing our policy will be more limited. 
In the opposition, our task remains to show the citizens what 
we would do differently from the government. Therefore, we do 
not have to prepare specially for an opposition strategy. 
  [Pinter] If you get into the government, what changes would 
you initiate in Parliament regarding the future relations with 
the opposition? 
  [Szajer] One should not mix up the government party and 
opposition roles. We must cooperate closely with the opposition 
only on really all-national issues and issues regarding our 
constitutional order. The opposition should continue its task 
of clearly analyzing the government policy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Agrarian Alliance Chairman Tamas Nagy by </F>
Gaspar; place and date not given: "Whom Does the Agrarian Force 
Attract?"] 
  [Text] We are approaching the elections. Not only the 
parties and their candidates, but also democracy will face a 
test on 8 May. The lines are delineated more and more 
spectacularly on the political palette. The parties "squeezed" 
between the right and the left, parties that call themselves 
liberal, have also "shaken up." As for their chances, we asked 
the head of one of the parties forming the group of four -- the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young 
Democrats [FIDESZ], the Agrarian Alliance, and the 
Entrepreneurs' Party -- namely Agrarian Alliance Chairman Tamas 
Nagy. 
  [Nagy] The Agrarian Alliance caused a positive surprise, 
because it has 134 individual candidates. Our forces are 
proportionally divided all over the country, and our strongest 
group is in western Hungary. This is very important for us. 
This is a tremendous change compared with 1990, because we were 
weak in this area at that time. Although I count on a close 
struggle, if we do well in the campaign, we will be able to 
participate in Parliament as a government party. 
  [Gaspar] In the opposition or in the coalition? 
  [Nagy] I think a coalition should be formed on the basis of 
the programs. The essence of the four-party agreement signed 
recently was to make our group work stronger and work out a 
joint action program that we can present to the voters: If the 
voters show confidence in this group, or a party within this 
group, we will take a stand in favor of such a concept. 
  [Gaspar] One hears that you also discussed the possibility 
of getting in touch with the socialists or rejecting this. 
  [Nagy] No, this is not correct. We were laughing at the 
fact that we said it for the fifth time that only elections were 
coming up, and everyone tells his alliance preferences during 
elections. The aforementioned four parties are together. We 
also said that we do not exclude the possibility that we can 
show a considerable force. From this moment on, the question is 
who will arrive in our group, and not with whom will the SZDSZ, 
the FIDESZ, or the Agrarian Alliance go. 
  [Gaspar] In other words, all for one, and one for all. 
  [Nagy] We are trying to take a common stand. We will 
probably sign a contract on this. If we succeed in coming to an 
agreement on a coalition, this group will attract someone. It 
is possible that we will not be successful in the elections, but 
we will nevertheless try to take a common stand. We would like 
to get enough votes to determine the coalition talks. This bloc 
received close to 1 million nomination slips. 
  [Gapsar] In your view, what is the cooperation between the 
parties like? 
  [Nagy] My opinion is that there is always a possibility for 
cooperation between democratic parties. The Agrarian Alliance 
will conduct a policy that leads to a strong and capable 
government. I do not think it is wise to exclude democratic 
parties, parties that accept the rules of the game and act 
accordingly. It is another matter what Viktor Orban, Ivan Peto, 
or Tamas Nagy feel personally.... Because none of these 
parties is made up of one person, but bodies that make decisions 
and approve the results of coalition talks. Politicians allow 
themselves a lot of things, but not hysterics or personal 
gossip! This is our position and this is also stipulated by our 
coalition guidelines.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Number of People Intending To </F>
Vote Is Increasing -- Forecast by Four Public Opinion Research 
Companies"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Szonda Ipsos </H5>
  The Szonda Ipsos Media, Opinion, and Market Research company 
has been collecting data on the views on political institutions, 
parties, and politicians since the beginning of 1991. On the 
basis of analyzing this data base and the latest -- April -- 
data, it prepared the following forecast for the first round of 
the parliamentary elections to take place on 8 May. 
  The expected participation level (in percentage of people 
entitled to vote) will be between 56 and 63 percent nationally; 
the most likely participation level is 58 percent nationally. 
Participation figures in the various areas (the counties and 
Budapest) can significantly deviate from the national average in 
both directions. 
  If the first round is valid in all 20 areas, namely more 
than 
half of the people entitled to vote participate in all counties 
and Budapest then it is most likely that the parties that formed 
parliamentary groups in 1990, and no other party, will again get 
into Parliament. It is not completely impossible, but there is 
very little chance for the Agrarian Federation, the Workers' 
Party, and the Republic Party to reach the 5-percent limit. 
  If the first round is valid in all areas, then 130 to 135 
mandates will be decided on the basis of the area lists. 
Through this, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] can get 62 
to 68 seats, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 22 to 26, 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 15 to 19, the Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz] 12 to 17, the Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP] five to 10, and the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP] also five to 10 seats. 
  However, in contrast to 1990, we now have to consider the 
possibility that the first round will not be valid in all areas 
because less than 50 percent of the entitled people will vote. 
Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, Hajdu-Bihar, Bacs-Kiskun, and 
Jasz-Nagykun- Szolnok counties have the biggest chance for this 
but, considering a participation at around 58 percent, the most 
likely scenario is that only Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county will 
have an invalid first round. 
  If the 8 May round is invalid in an area, the distribution 
of 
the area mandates can be significantly different from that 
indicated above because participation will presumably be much 
lower in the second round. The size of the difference will 
naturally depend on which counties will have to hold a second 
round, and what level of participation will then be reached. 
  In the individual electoral districts, similarly to 1990, 
the 
mandates will mostly be decided only in the second round because 
most of the candidates will not get an absolute majority of 
votes in the first round. For this reason alone -- regardless 
of the validity of the voting on the basis of lists -- the 
mandates of the national lists can only be decided after the 
second round. 
  Considering the fact that the electoral law prohibits the 
publication of public opinion polls in the last eight days 
before the elections, there might even be considerable 
differences between this forecast and the actual election 
results because the intentions to participate and the party 
preferences can still significantly change between the date of 
the last survey (8 to 18 April) and the day of the elections. 
<H5>  Modus </H5>
  In its regular "omnibus" researches, the Modus Economic and 
Social Marketing Ltd. also poses questions on election 
preferences. The questions are directed at the level of 
participation in the elections, primary and secondary voting 
preferences, and dispreferences. The last of Modus's national 
surveys took place between 1 and 8 April at 100 collection 
points, in the form of personal interviews. The sample 
represents the country's population according to gender, age, 
level of schooling, and type of dwelling place. The proportion 
of the people questioned in the sample corresponds to people 
over the age of 15 living in various regions of the country. 
The size of the sample is 960. 
  According to their latest surveys, the proportion of those 
people who would participate in the elections, if they were held 
today, has increased (73 percent). In their view, this can be 
attributed to the effects of the campaign. This change took 
place mainly to the detriment of "I do not know" answers, which 
allows us to conclude that the campaign mainly convinced the 
uncertain voters about the need to vote, rather than the 
citizens who are not interested in politics. Some 69 percent of 
those who intend to vote named a party. This means that, 
similar to 1990, the campaign activity of the last few days will 
have a major effect on the final results. 
  Examining the parties preferred by those who selected a 
party, the Modus found that the MSZP can expect 36 percent of 
the votes. It seems that the trend that began in November 1993 
is also continuing in the campaign period. The Socialist have a 
good chance of winning the elections. Preference for the Fidesz 
is at 17 percent. According to indications, the Fidesz's 
descent has stopped. Compared to the survey in February, the 
SZDSZ lost 0.8 percent, which cannot be seen as a significant 
change. According to the April results, 16 percent of people 
who selected a party would vote for them. Out of the parties of 
the current government coalition, the KDNP is the most stable 
party, its expected result was 9 percent in both of the last two 
surveys. Sympathy for the MDF and the smallholders is moving in 
opposite directions: The MDF's is increasing and the 
smallholders' is decreasing. However, both changes are within 
the statistical error margin. All parties currently outside 
Parliament can expect less than 1 percent. Therefore, according 
to the Modus's assessments, the current parliamentary party 
structure will only change in its proportions rather than its 
members. 
<H5>  Gallup </H5>
  Gallup's last survey was conducted between 22 and 24 April 
on 
a national sample of 1,500 people representing the country's 
adult population. Fifty-five percent of the people questioned 
before the elections were very sure about their participation, 
and a further 18 percent said that they would certainly go to 
vote. On the basis of this, it is likely that the participation 
in the elections will approach or even reach 70 percent. 
  According to Gallup, out of those who selected a party, a 
chsnge of only a few percent in party preferences can be 
expected during the campaign period. Within the whole 
population, the proportion of MSZP supporters increased from the 
March 19 percent to 20 percent, the SZDSZ's from 9 to 11 
percent, the MDF's from 6 to 8 percent, while the Fidesz's 
decreased from 10 to 9 percent. These differences based on the 
whole population change if we only consider those people who 
intend to participate in the elections. Among the likely 
voters, 31 percent of those who already selected a party would 
vote for the MSZP. Among the absolutely certain participants, 
this proportion is 33 percent. (This was 35 percent in the 
previous month.) Among the likely voters, the SZDSZ can expect 
16 percent, the Fidesz 13, and the MDF 12 percent. The FKGP 
would receive 9 percent, and the KDNP 7 percent on the basis of 
the answers. If only those people went to vote who are very 
certain about this now, the Fidesz and the MDF would get 11 
percent, the SZDSZ 14 percent, the FKGP 9 percent, and the KDNP 
7 percent. 
  Eighty-five percent of people who named a party are very 
certain or certain that they would also choose the party they 
now prefer on 8 May, and 15 percent are still uncertain about 
this. 
  Apart from the six parties mentioned above, none of the 
others are expected to have a chance to acquire 5 percent 
support. According to the expectations of 30 percent of people, 
the MSZP will win the elections on 8 May, 15 percent expect the 
SZDSZ, and 11 percent the MDF. The corresponding proportions 
were 24, 13, and 10 percent in the previous month. The 
proportion of people who were unable to answer this question 
decreased from the 41 percent in March to 31 percent in April. 
  The campaign had more effect on the views on the prime 
ministerial candidates. Gabor Kuncze's performance is the most 
striking. In March, if a decision had to be made between [MSZP 
Chairman] Horn and Kuncze, 23 percent would have selected Kuncze 
and 46 percent Horn. In April, these proportions changed to 32 
and 39 percent. 
  In March, 20 percent named Horn, 19 percent Boross, and 10 
percent Kuncze to the question "All in all, whom would you 
prefer most as the country's prime minister?" In April, 22 
percent would welcome Horn, 17 percent Boross, and 16 percent 
Kuncze as prime minister. (In both months, 18 percent of people 
were unable to answer this question.) 
<H5>  Median </H5>
  According to the Median Public Opinion and Market Research 
Ltd, no one can claim to offer absolutely precise predictions 10 
days before the elections, because even the latest polls were 
done at least one and a half to two weeks before the elections 
and no one can foresee what will happen during the remaining 
days of the campaign. 
  However, in view of the participation in the elections, it 
is 
possible to make predictions on the basis of rather clear 
trends. Participation on 8 May will certainly exceed the 1990 
level and can be expected at 74 to 80 percent according to our 
assessments. 
  It is even more difficult to predict the party results on 
the 
basis of lists. The results of the latest survey (this was 
between 15 and 20 April in the case of Median), the trends 
preceding this, and background information on the parties have 
to be taken into consideration. Median weighted the "raw" 
answers with sympathy figures for the parties, and opinions on 
the parties' interest representation and problem solving 
abilities. 
  All in all, Median gave the results in a relatively narrow 
margin, indicating the minimum, maximum, and most likely values 
according to their current knowledge. According to this, the 
MSZP can expect 31 to 38 percent (most likely 34), the SZDSZ 15 
to 19 (17), the MDF 9 to 14 (11), the Fidesz 7 to 10 (9), the 
KDNP 7 to 10 (7), and the FKGP 6 to 8 (9), while the other 
parties together can expect 11 to 17 percent (most likely 14).

  [Text] The amount of credit given to businesses grew 
vigorously in 1993, as we learned from the February report of 
the Hungarian National Bank. The central bank estimates the 
growth to be between 105 and 117 billion forints [Ft], which 
corresponds to a 16-18 percent increase. As a comparison, in 
1992, the amount of credits increased by Ft2.7 billion, i.e., by 
0.4 percent. 
  In estimating the increase in the actual amount of credit, 
the central bank took into consideration the cancellation of 
debts, which led to a decrease in the amount of credit. The 
cancellation of debts at the end of 1993 affected outstanding 
amounts of Ft61.3 billion; according to preliminary data from 
the banks, the effect on the decrease in the amount of credit 
can be estimated to be Ft30-42 billion. As a result of debt 
cancellation during the year, the amount of credit to businesses 
decreased by Ft15.1 billion. 
  While the amount of current asset credits to businesses 
decreased in 1992, in 1993 it increased by approximately 12 
percent. However, the amount of investment credit decreased in 
both years. The pace of the growth of foreign currency credits 
to businesses slackened: While in 1992 the increase amounted to 
Ft14.5 billion, in 1993 it amounted to only Ft4.5 billion. The 
pace of the growth of small business loans was nearly the same 
in the last two years. In 1992 the amount of credit increased by 
Ft14.8 billion, while in 1993 it increased by Ft15.4 billion. 
  The amount of loans taken out by businesses directly from 
abroad amounted to $1 billion, which increased gradually to $1.8 
billion in the course of the year until September and remained 
constant by the end of the year. According to year-end data, the 
discrepancy in interest rates decreased. Although the decrease 
in the discrepancy between the interest rates for credits which 
would come due within the year and those which were taken out 
this year, which began in May, came to a halt in the fall, it 
continued in December, and as a result at the end of the year 
the discrepancy between interest rates was the lowest since May 
1992 (9 percent).

  [Text] An agreement was reached at the coordinating session 
between the retirement administration and the parliamentary 
groups of the parties to the effect that after 1 January 1995 
women can still retire at 55; this proposal will be submitted to 
the National Assembly. At the same time, work must begin on 
raising the retirement age, on flexible retirement, and on 
incentives to work longer. 
  The coordinating session, which was initiated by the 
retirement administration based on a resolution of the latest 
general assembly, was attended by six of the parliamentary 
groups, including representatives of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party, the Association of Young Democrats, the independents, the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum, and the Christian Democratic 
People's Party. The attending representatives agreed that the 
prerequisites for raising the retirement age by 1 January 1995 
have not been met. For this reason the retirement administration 
proposed to postpone raising the retirement age, to detach it 
from the package of amendments to the social insurance law, and 
to treat it as a separate package. 
  According to Social Committee Chairman Gyula Kis, who also 
represented the position of the Welfare Ministry, women who have 
been employed for at least 20 years and who will turn 55 between 
1 January 1995 and the time when the law on increasing the 
retirement age becomes effective should be able to retire 
without limitation, but their employers should not be able to 
send them into retirement merely because they reached the 
retirement age. A motion to this effect was submitted to 
parliament already, requesting urgent discussion of the matter. 
Work continues on the rest of the package.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Budapest Bank: Increase in Interest </F>
Rates; Increase in Imports Expected"] 
  [Text] The great question this year will be the development 
of the balance of trade and the balance of payments, we learned 
at the Budapest Bank's 3 March briefing on macroeconomic 
prognoses. According to department head Peter Bihari, both the 
increase in consumer activity and the acceleration in demand for 
investment will primarily increase the import of products. The 
growth of exports will not be able to keep pace with imports, 
and thus the trade deficit could be in excess of $3 billion. 
  The expected budget deficit of 300-350 billion forints will 
have a similar effect. Such a deficit will be impossible to 
finance on the domestic financial market; according to 
indications the population's inclination to save is also waning. 
Thus, in any case, one will have to seek credit from foreign 
markets, or perhaps the next government will use up a portion of 
the foreign currency reserves. 
  Incidentally, it was also said at the briefing that as of 2 
March Budapest Bank increased interest payments on every 
short-term and long-term savings account. The increase is 
between 2 and 3 percent, depending on the term of the account; 
thus, for savings accounts with a term of 1-6 months, it will 
pay 16-19 percent instead of the previous 14-16.5 percent.

<F P=106> ["Message by His Majesty King Mihai I to the Homeland on </F>
Holy Easter 1994" -- date not given] 
  [Text] Romanians: 
  Today, when you are celebrating the Holy Easter Holidays, 
together with your families in your villages or in your towns, I 
am addressing you in earnest. 
  I decided to accept the invitation of the Metropolitan of 
Banat and of the Mayor of Timisoara to come to our Romanian land 
and pray together for our homeland. 
  In spite of their promises, those who are ruling today do 
not 
allow me to be together with you where I had been invited, that 
is in Timisoara. They have not succeeded in overcoming the fear 
of those direct ties that exist between you and me, ties whose 
signs became evident two years ago when hundreds of you welcomed 
me with enthusiasm. 
  The authorities are wrong. For all of you and for them, too, 
my presence among you represents the guarantee of civil and 
moral peace, as well as the spiritual peace that the Homeland 
needs in order to emerge from self-doubt, discouragement, and 
fear. Having confidence in what was said at the first talks 
that started two weeks ago on practical aspects of my journey, I 
hoped that the authorities finally understood that my only 
preoccupation is to make a contribution, with all my power, to 
the reconciliation of all Romanians, because only together can 
we revive Romania. 
  Although I was ready to take into consideration all 
solutions 
in the name of the major interest of all Romanians and national 
unity, in spite of the wish showed by some people who are 
involved in administering the Homeland's affairs, I have to 
notice with sorrow that the highest level of the state 
leadership still upholds the unjust decision regarding my 
exclusion, a decision taken by the leaders of the communist 
state coup over 40 years ago. 
  Romanians, because of you and for you, I do not want to lose 
hope. The Lord's resurrection is the triumph of hope over 
suspicion and we share the same belief in the triumph of life 
over death. 
  Christ has arisen! 
  This is the time when our patience has to yield results. 
Christ has arisen! 
  The time has come for those who suffered injustice to rise 
and move on. We say the same prayer for our Homeland, for your 
families, and for your future. 
  Christ has arisen! 
  Romanians, my destiny is in your hands. My return depends on 
each of you, by respecting the freedom and dignity of each 
person. 
  I know that many of you have publicly shown the wish to see 
me among you and I was greatly moved listening to the appeals of 
the representatives of the nation, of young people, of 
intellectuals, of trade unions, and of numerous associations. 
To all this one can add the thousands of letters that I receive 
from faithful fellow nationals. 
  The time has come for us, after sacrifices and suffering, to 
be together at the revival of our homeland. 
  On behalf of my family, I wish you happy holidays. 
  So help us God! 
  Mihai

<F P=106> [Report by Andrei Badin: "The Authorities Fear Not So Much </F>
the King as the People Who Acclaim Him"] 
  [Text] Their Majesties King Mihai and Queen Ana will not 
be in Romania over the Easter Holidays. Again, the authorities 
have prevented, in an elegant way, it is true, the visit of the 
Sovereign. After the royal family had handed in their passports 
[for the granting of the visa] on 8 April to the Romanian 
embassy in Bern and the King reasserted his declaration 
according to which he does not intend to contest the 
constitutional order (which does not mean that he also 
acknowledges the Constitution), the Bucharest authorities sent 
their representative to Versoix [royal headquarters in 
Switzerland]. That representative was Ion Gorita, state 
secretary of the ministry of foreign affairs. Being in Paris, 
accompanying President Ion Iliescu on his visit in France, 
Gorita contacted His Majesty's secretariat over the telephone. 
In the afternoon of the same day, 16 April, he received an 
audience at Versoix. At that time the point of view expressed 
by the envoy of the Romanian authorities was that "the 
government sees no impediment to the visit of the King." 
  Thus, a significant change in the stance of the authorities 
began to take shape, a shift compared to the hysteria that they 
referred to whenever the king previously tried to return to his 
native country. They agreed that during the following days the 
King would designate the persons who were to represent him at 
the negotiations scheduled to take place in Bucharest with the 
representatives of the authorities. His Majesty the King 
designated Messrs. Gheorghe Antoniade and Dan Badic to conduct 
the talks. On behalf of the Romanian authorities the talks were 
attended, in the first phase, by Messrs. Ion Gorita, George Ioan 
Danescu, state secretary at the ministry of interior, and other 
officials. Initially they raised the issue of his visit to 
Timisoara, as the King had been officially invited by the mayor 
of that municipality, Viorel Oancea, and His Holiness Nicolae 
Corneanu, the Metropolitan of Banat. The talks were also 
attended by the Timis County prefect and the head of the county 
police. Their first stipulation was the King's isolation from 
Timisoara. The authorities suggested that his residence should 
be at one of Ceausescu's former Houses, in the locality of 
Pischia, 27 kilometers away from Timisoara. The royal house 
could not accept that offer, first because the king had wanted 
to stay in a house owned by the church and, second, because 
having been invited by Timisoara, he could not understand why he 
should keep out of Timisoara. Then the authorities invented 
further pretexts, such as the fact that the king's protection 
(against whom?) could not be ensured in Timisoara, or they 
claimed they held information (from what source?) according to 
which during the royal visit in Timisoara both pro-monarchy and 
anti-monarchy (?!?) demonstrations were planned. Eventually, 
after further discussions, the authorities openly admitted that 
Timisoara could in no way be the scene of the royal visit. 
Trying to stall reaching an agreement, the government then 
invented an extreme solution: They would officially invite the 
King to visit, "wherever" else he wishes to go. 
  The King pondered this new proposal a great deal, after 
which 
he authorized his representatives in Bucharest to state that for 
the good of the country and for the sake of national 
reconciliation, the King accepts, in principle, that proposal, 
provided that Viorel Oancea, the Timisoara mayor, as well as 
Metropolitan Corneanu should accompany him wherever he goes. It 
was quite difficult for the King to accept that government 
proposal as he felt bound by very deep feelings to Timisoara, 
the martyr city, which the authorities had several times 
prevented him from visiting. On Wednesday [27 April] evening, 
at government headquarters, new talks were held between the 
King's representatives and those of the executive, among whom 
Mr. Viorel Hrebenciuc, the general secretary of the government, 
also attended. They came up with yet another thing: Having 
said that the king could visit "wherever" he wished, the 
government now suggested a new variant containing three 
possibilities: The king should visit Curtea de Arges, Putna, or 
Olanesti [monasteries], where he would be sheltered in "palaces" 
and "copious meals" would be served to him. It is worth noting 
that the representatives of the authorities were constantly 
trying to flatter the king's envoys by mentioning the palaces, 
meals, and other such "favors" that the government would be 
ready to provide for His Majesty. What is more, the government 
suggested that they would send a BAC-type aircraft to Geneva 
solely for the transportation of the royal family to Romania, 
which would mean spending a huge amount of money. The King's 
representatives replied that there was no need for such a thing, 
as the King wished to travel by a normal airline flight and he 
did not intend to stay in palaces or dine copiously. The 
government people found it very difficult to comprehend that 
point of view. Eventually, the King expressed his wish to visit 
Bucharest, a thing that originally had been suggested by the 
Government. However, now they did not accept. This is, in 
general terms, how the 10-day Bucharest talks among the 
representatives of the king and those of the government evolved. 
  Anyone can easily see that the authorities changed their 
stance each time the wind changed direction. The final 
impression was that actually they were merely trying to delay 
making a decision and to finally convince His Majesty to accept 
that the visit should be as secretive as possible and in a place 
selected by the government. Having requested that the visit 
should have a private character, the government wanted an 
official one, kept secret, the schedule of which was also to be 
established by the government. All this happened after Ion 
Gorita, on 16 April, in Versoix, had said that "there are no 
problems." No comment needed!

<F P=106> [Report by Konrad Schuller: "The Social Democracy Party of </F>
Romania Advocates a Grand Coalition in Romania"] 
  [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR), the 
strongest force in the nominally suprapartisan government in 
Bucharest, has repeatedly been stressing its willingness for 
economic and social reforms. Its Executive President Nastase, 
who is also president of the Chamber of Deputies, even offered a 
grand coalition to the market-oriented opposition in an 
interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Representatives of the 
largest opposition alliance, the Democratic Convention of 
Romania (CDR), however, expressed the suspicion that such offers 
are only tactical and primarily designed to exert pressure on 
postcommunist or chauvinist parties that reluctantly support the 
Romanian minority government in parliament. A grand coalition 
would reduce the influence of these parties. Also, the PDSR no 
longer wants to be considered an opponent to reform abroad. 
  Nastase stated that his party, which has so far determined 
the hesitant policy of the independent Prime Minister Vacaroiu, 
is in agreement with the opposition on the objectives of foreign 
policy. There is full accord that closer ties should be 
established with the West. The PDSR, which is considered a 
reservoir of former communist elites by its opponents, today 
advocates a European-type social democracy "with a liberal 
touch." As far as the economy and privatization are concerned, 
it has numerous elements in common with the opposition. Since 
the beginning of the year, contacts have been established with 
all parties to win them over for more radical economic reforms. 
Romania has committed itself vis-a-vis the IMF to carry out 
resolute reforms. In return, it received promises for a credit 
worth 1.16 billion German marks. Nastase stressed that his 
party wants to accelerate the privatization of the economy. 
This year, a total of 300 enterprises have been privatized. It 
is quite natural that this should lead to a rise in unemployment 
(11 percent). The population and the trade unions are not 
afraid of reforms. In spite of the government's "very tough" 
reform policy, polls show that the PDSR has not yet scared off 
its supporters. Parliament must now draft a competition law and 
a law on local taxes that would give the communities more power. 
For these and other projects, the PDSR needs the support of the 
opposition. The PDSR wants to end the domestic "cold war" and 
begin a "phase of cooperation" with the opposition. 
  Deputy Ciumara, a leading member of the National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party (PNTCD), the strongest force in the 
opposition alliance CDR, views such offers with suspicion. He 
believes that the unofficial government party PDSR does not want 
to give up its monopoly of power. Nastase, who likes to stress 
the government's readiness for reform, is only pretending 
because the government and the PDSR depend on the old directors 
and cadres of the former regime who are opposed to reform. The 
300 privatized enterprises about whom Nastase is talking are not 
important at all. 
  According to Ciumara, the PDSR ignores the most demands by 
the opposition in its offers. It is neither willing to comply 
with the demand that, in a cabinet of a grand coalition, no 
party must receive more than 50 percent of the seats nor with 
the request that every minister should be given complete freedom 
in his office. Also, it ignores the decision by the parties 
united in the CDR that talks on alliances should only be held 
jointly. The PDSR is seeking contacts with individual members 
of the alliance to split the CDR. 
  Nastase speaks of a grand coalition as one of the other 
possibilities. He demands that "formal aspects," such as the 
composition of the government, not be stressed too much, and not 
"party interests" but "common issues of interest" be given 
priority. Yet this would mean that his PDSR ministers alone 
would keep their positions and that the circles surrounding 
President Iliescu could continue to play off the communist and 
nationalists against the conservative opposition in Parliament. 
The PDSR has succeeded in so doing recently. Its satellite 
parties have accepted the agreement with the IMF, despite the 
fact that they had always vehemently rejected the submission to 
demands by foreign institutions. Nastase explained their 
support by pointing out that they did not want to topple the 
"center-left government" because they might get a "center-right" 
government which they would no longer be able to influence.

<F P=106> [Report by Liviu Tudor: "The General Police Inspectorate Has </F>
Set Up Its Own Intelligence Service"] 
  [Text] A "Directorate for Operative Supervision and 
Intelligence" has recently been set up within the General Police 
Inspectorate. The new informative service of the General Police 
Inspectorate is headed by Colonel Traian Dima and became 
operational with the new restructuring of the services and 
directorates within the General Police Inspectorate. 
  From the name of the new service, which is not subordinated 
to Military Unit [UM] 0215 Bucharest, one can infer that its 
duty is to carry out an intelligence supervisory watch on the 
activity of the General Police Inspectorate and to brief the 
Inspectorate leadership on relevant operational developments. 
  The initiator of this intelligence unit is Major General Ion 
Pitulescu, head of the General Police Inspectorate. The first 
attempt made by Major General Ion Pitulescu to set up such an 
intelligence service within the Inspectorate's structure was 
last March, when his initial proposal was turned down. By 
claiming that UM 0215 Bucharest -- a specialized unit designed 
to defend state secrets in the Ministry of Interior and ensure 
the protection of the police personnel -- "cannot fulfill such 
duties in the sphere of the police bodies' activity," the head 
of the General Police Inspectorate, Major General Ion Pitulescu, 
emerged victorious and obtained the approval for setting up the 
new unit. 
  Therefore, to the five already existing domestic 
intelligence 
services, one should now add a sixth one, namely the Directorate 
for Operative Supervision and Intelligence of the General Police 
Inspectorate.

<F P=106> [Article by "(jik)": "More Than One-Third of Civic </F>
Democratic Alliance Supporters Are Former Civic Democratic Party 
Voters"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Civic Democratic Alliance and the Czech 
Social Democratic Party [CSSD] have gained the most new 
supporters since the last elections, in 1992. While 5.2 percent 
of citizens voted for the Alliance then, it now enjoys the 
support of 12.7 percent of respondents, according to a poll 
conducted by the Center for Empirical Research. Seven percent of 
the electorate cast their votes for the social democrats in the 
elections; however, 15.7 percent of citizens would vote for them 
now. 
  The Alliance gained most of its current supporters--37 
percent--from among former Civic Democratic Party [ODS] voters. 
Another 13 percent have transferred from the Free Democrats 
(Civic Movement [OH]), the Liberal Social Union, the Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, the CSSD, and the 
Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. 
  Seventeen percent of those who would support the social 
democrats in new elections voted for the ODS last time; 15 
percent voted for the Left Bloc. Some former OH and Movement 
for Self-Governing Democracy-Society for Moravia and Silesia 
voters have now decided to vote for Zeman's party.

  [Excerpts] The economic ministers decided today to pay off 
part of the debt to the IMF. Editor Vladislav Kulhavy reports 
from the government office: 
  [Kulhavy] It is a sum to the value of $430 million. 
According to Dr. (Holman), adviser to the Czech Government, the 
state can afford this extraordinary repayment for 1995 in view 
of the high foreign currency reserves of the Czech National 
Bank. This extraordinary repayment of part of the debt will, at 
the same time, mean considerable savings. [passage omitted] 
  The ministers also agreed to establish two new independent 
customs zones, in Decin and Temelin. 
  Apart from that, the meeting accepted a decision to 
privatize 
Kablo Velke Mezirici in the form of a public competition and 
agreed with the principles for further talks on creating a free 
trade zone with Romania. The ministers' meeting referred the 
materials on apprentice training for further revision.

  [Text] The customs union and the payment agreement with the 
Czech Republic were disadvantageous in many respects for 
Slovakia, declared Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita 
Schmoeglerova. According to the deputy prime minister, the 
Czechs could not be blamed for this state of affairs. On the 
contrary, the blame was attached to the former Slovak 
Government, which was not well prepared for negotiations that 
led to the conclusion of the agreements. 
  Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister of industry and trade, had 
this to say to Czech Radio on the subject: 
  [Begin Dlouhy recording] I would need to know her comments 
in 
total. My opinion is, however, that the customs union is 
advantageous for both sides because it has opened up markets for 
us more than if we did not have one. I would not like to enter 
into a discussion about the payment agreement--which, according 
to press reports, was also contained in the comments made by the 
deputy prime minister--but, regarding the customs union, I am 
100-percent certain that it is advantageous for both sides. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Responses by FRY Ambassador to Croatia Veljko Knezevic to </F>
written questions from Ramiro Villapadierna; date not given: 
"Yugoslavia Has No Territorial Claims -- There Has Already Been 
Too Much War"] 
  [Text] Veljko Knezevic is Belgrade's first ambassador to 
Croatia since the war between the two countries in 1991. Serbia 
still holds 27 percent of Croatian territory. A Serb from 
Croatian Krajina, Knezevic was in charge of Zagreb television 
for 10 years, before escaping to Krajina in the fall of 1990 to 
found the underground Petrova Gora TV station that was before 
long encouraging the Serbian radicals to go to war. 
  Since the start of the 1980's, at the time of the great 
Serbian repression in Kosovo, Veljko Knezevic held a position of 
strategic importance for the Communist Party at the head of 
Zagreb TV, despite scarcely having had a primary education -- a 
fact which caused considerable controversy in cultivated Zagreb. 
He remained at its head until his embarrassing escape to 
Krajina, eight months before the start of the war. His return 
as -- for the time being, acting -- ambassador, has been 
interpreted in Zagreb as a provocation by [Serbian Prime 
Minister] Milosevic. Knezevic refused to give ABC an interview 
for two weeks, finally agreeing to answer our questions in 
writing. 
  [Villapadierna] Do you think you will get Croatia to 
recognize your country? 
  [Knezevic] My role as ambassador is set out in an interstate 
agreement. That is my country's plan and it is certain that 
soon we will arrive at a situation of mutual recognition. 
However, in the meantime, we have to respect the reality of 
things: This is not a normal process for Yugoslavia because we 
are being subjected to violent, drastic, and inhumane 
international sanctions. In any case, the interests of European 
powers, the United States, and world powers are involved in such 
a way that everything has become complicated, and often 
development depends more on foreign influence than on those who 
are directly involved, namely Yugoslavia and Croatia. If you 
add to that Washington's new strategy, with Croat and Muslim 
Bosnians, it is clear that the path to normalization and 
recognition will be heavy-going, thorny, and uncertain. 
However, we are supported by the desire of both governments and 
peoples to continue with normalization and to resolve everything 
by political means. There has already been enough talk of war, 
too much talk. 
  [Villapadierna] When do you hope to reestablish telephone, 
road, and rail links between Serbia and Croatia? 
  [Knezevic] Normalization will be a very long process for 
objective reasons: There are many issues that have yet to be 
resolved. The main thing is negotiation and agreement between 
Croatia and the (self-proclaimed -- ABC editor's note) Serbian 
Republic of Krajina. The first step has already been taken: 
The cease-fire that has been signed has put a stop to all 
military conflict and the borders have already been agreed on. 
Thanks to a very disciplined approach, the highest level of the 
agreement has been accepted, and that is a very good thing. 
Second-stage negotiations will begin shortly on telephone, 
trade, rail, and road links. All of these issues are connected 
and conditioned by an agreement between Krajina and Croatia. 
Given that these issues are of very great interest to everyone, 
we hope that concrete discussions can begin immediately in both 
sets of negotiations: Croatia-Krajina and Croatia-Yugoslavia. 
Yugoslavia has no territorial claims on any neighboring country 
and we will accept any agreement between Krajina and Croatia. 
  [Villapadierna] Some 7,500 people disappeared in the 
Croatian 
war. Has the joint committee made any progress? 
  [Knezevic] The Yugoslav side has taken its role on this 
committee very seriously. With great humanitarian respect, it 
has started to draw up a list of names, although not all the 
documentation has been completed. Not one shred of information 
will be ignored. The Yugoslav side will in this area apply all 
international standards and will accept the contribution of any 
qualified humanitarian delegation. 
  [Villapadierna] What is your impression of Zagreb on your 
return, three years after your publicized escape to Belgrade? 
  [Knezevic] Well, it is as it always was: Very clean, the 
people are peaceful and calm, the shop window displays are good 
and varied, and there is a very well stocked market. In 
political life there is dialogue between parties on political 
and economic issues, which is good for the development of 
democracy and the multipartite system. The government has made 
a tremendous decision to try and carry through its program for 
general development, stabilization, and budgetary discipline to 
control inflation, and to support production and foreign trade. 
Privatization is making slow progress, there is no way of 
changing the production system, and the State still owns a lot 
of capital and property. The standard of living has stabilized, 
albeit at a modest level. However, the government is very 
active at the level of international contacts and economic 
cooperation, and as a result they can soon hope to see a rise in 
living standards.

  [Text] The Serbian regime of Belgrade has concocted a 
story that an Albanian soldier has murdered two Serbian soldiers 
at a barracks in the town of Mladinovac. This time, too, the 
Serbian mass media announced the news in the same way as several 
years ago when the Serbian authorities in Belgrade concocted a 
story about the murder of several soldiers at a barracks in 
Paracin city in Serbia. Even at that time, the killer was an 
Albanian, the late Aziz Kelmendi. 
  According to Serbian television in Belgrade and the report 
by 
the same television in Prishtina, the murder of Serbian soldiers 
in Mladinovac was committed by a Shaban Bajrami from Medvegje, a 
commune situated in eastern Kosova, which, together with the 
communes of Presheve and Bujanovc, have declared political and 
territorial autonomy with the possibility of uniting with the 
republic of Kosova. 
  According to Serbian television, the murderer Shaban Bajrami 
allegedly fired on Serbian soldiers with an automatic weapon and 
is now in hiding. 
  It is known that young Albanians are refusing to serve in 
the 
army of the Serbian aggressor. Even those who are violently 
pressganged into this army are not given any weapons or 
ammunition; thus these fabrications of the alleged murder of 
Serbian soldiers by an Albanian soldier are completely false. 
Serbia needs such propaganda to hide the truth about the 
murders of hundreds of Serbian youths in the war in Bosnia. The 
majority of the Serbian youths are being secretly sent to this 
front, without even their families being informed .
