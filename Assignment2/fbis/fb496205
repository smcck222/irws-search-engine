<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F>
by Lubo Rabay; place and date not given: "Not Only Macroeconomic 
Connections"] 
  [Text] What is our true position in relation to the 
large international financial institutions such as the IMF and 
the World Bank? We discussed the changes in our approach to 
these institutions, and in their approach to us, with Deputy 
Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova. 
  [Rabay] Has devaluation under certain circumstances ever 
been considered? 
  [Schmognerova] No. 
  [Rabay] Even if it had been considered, you would hardly be 
likely to admit it. Let us therefore formulate the question the 
other way around: What will save us from devaluation at a time 
when we talk about the need for financial balance? 
  [Schmognerova] The IMF does not discuss these issues with 
the government but with the National Bank. Of course, we, too, 
would know about it. 
  [Rabay] At a news conference following your return from 
Washington you said that the IMF's position in relation to the 
Eastern European countries is becoming more flexible. In which 
way? 
  [Schmognerova] What I had in mind was that they are now 
incorporating the building of a social safety net into their 
program so as not to jeopardize the reforms through a 
deterioration in the position of the weaker social strata, which 
might provoke unrest.... 
  [Rabay] This new approach thus has a political rather than 
an economic dimension.... 
  [Schmognerova] The IMF focuses mainly on the macroeconomic 
balance. My critical objection to this was that it is necessary 
to see the broader connections of reforms. 
  [Rabay] Could you be more specific about how their position 
is more flexible today? 
  [Schmognerova] For example, until recently, they had not 
been pushing for the building of a social safety net. Now it is 
also possible to cooperate to a greater extent with the World 
Bank in structural changes to the economy. If measures taken in 
fiscal and monetary policy, which can be implemented fairly 
quickly, are not supplemented with measures in the real sphere, 
that is, at the company level, the effect from the attained 
financial balance disappears very quickly and even tougher 
monetary measures will have to follow. 
  [Rabay] I think that we have already been able to convince 
ourselves of the truth of this statement. As regards the World 
Bank, we know that, when promising assistance, it demands from 
the other side a clear setting of priorities. Are we able to 
set them today, or are we going to subordinate ourselves to 
whatever life will bring? 
  [Schmognerova] Our problem is not that we did not formulate 
our basic priorities but that we have not been able to implement 
them. Even the preceding government subscribed to 
transformation and privatization. In the Memorandum on Economic 
Policy, for example, it pledged to liberalize energy prices, but 
it was not able to push it through. Privatization ground to a 
halt. The law on bankruptcies preserved in many enterprises the 
pretransformation situation because only the article of the law 
permitting the suspension of bankruptcy proceedings was used. 
In short, all kinds of things had been prepared but little was 
actually done. 
  [Rabay] Are you suggesting that the present Slovak 
Government's more active approach, which you have repeatedly 
stressed on other occasions, actually means that the previous 
government's policy is being shifted into the phase of 
implementation? 
  [Schmognerova] We are realists, we know that only five 
months are ahead of us. At any rate, we would like to set this 
phase in motion. 
  [Rabay] Are you thinking of privatization? 
  [Schmognerova] Not only privatization. We would also like 
to speed up the transformation of the social sphere and start 
very energetically tackling also the financial situation in the 
company sphere and in commercial banks. This is a long-term 
process but it needs to be speeded up.... 
  [Rabay] Is this a signal that bankruptcies will start? Is 
there some kind of a list of companies that are earmarked for 
bankruptcy? 
  [Schmognerova] There is a list at the Ministry of Economy. 
Of course, it will not be applied mechanically. Especially 
with respect to enterprises of regional significance with great 
impact on the social sphere, bankruptcies must be preceded by 
measures providing security for the people laid off. The World 
Bank's assistance could be significant precisely in this regard. 
  [Rabay] Do you think that foreign investors' interest in 
Slovakia will increase during this government's term of office? 
  [Schmognerova] Measures such as tax relief do not seem to me 
to matter all that much in this respect. Foreign investors are 
interested chiefly in political stability, which, it seems, we 
have succeeded in improving, as foreign reactions show. As 
regards specific steps, we are expecting the arrival soon of a 
mission of potential U.S. investors.... 
  [Rabay] A large-scale mission of Canadian financiers and 
businessmen pursuing a similar aim was to take place a few days 
ago. Why did it not materialize? 
  [Schmognerova] It had not been well prepared on the Canadian 
side, that is, on the part of Canadian Slovaks. With regard to 
conditions for foreign investors, we want to concentrate 
particularly on eliminating administrative obstacles to their 
participation in privatization. 
  [Rabay] But is coupon privatization not one such obstacle? 
Three years passed before the companies privatized in this way 
in the first wave could proceed to their actual transformation 
and behave as independent entities.... 
  [Schmognerova] What we need most badly today is a real 
change in the conduct of companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Ondrej Dostal: "According to the Results of a </F>
Public Opinion Survey, Most of Slovak Society Welcomed the 
Change of Governments"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of April, the Statistical Office 
of the Slovak Republic conducted a opinion survey that confirmed 
the conclusions arrived at by some other research institutions 
regarding the increase in the popularity of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] following its transfer to opposition. 
The survey did, however, provide other interesting data 
concerning the public opinion on the vote of no confidence in 
Meciar's government, early elections, and party preferences. 
  On the whole, it can be said that the opinion of the Slovak 
public regarding the change of governments is genuinely mixed, 
yet approval ultimately prevails. The entire parliamentary 
address by President Kovac that launched the process of 
recalling the government was endorsed by 24 percent of the 
respondents, parts of it were endorsed by 27 percent, while 16 
percent of respondents completely disagreed with the president. 
In comparison, Meciar's parliamentary address immediately prior 
to the no-confidence vote was approved of completely by 19 
percent, partially approved of by 29 percent, while 19 percent 
of respondents completely disagreed. The no-confidence vote in 
the government met with approval by 44 percent of those asked, 
while 39 percent disapproved of it. Those, who agreed with the 
president mostly disagreed with the then prime minister, and 
vice versa. The large representation of supporters of the Party 
of the Democratic Left [SDL] among those who partially agreed 
with Kovac but also among those who partially agreed with Meciar 
is of particular interest. 
  Trust in the president declined between March and April from 
73 to 56 percent, while trust in parliament increased during 
that time from 29 to 40 percent. Trust in the president is 
dominant among the supporters of all political entities with the 
exception of the HZDS and the Slovak National Party [SNS] (this 
explains the decline in the trust in the president). In the 
instances of the National Council of the Slovak Republic and the 
government, doubting HZDS and SNS supporters are joined by 
supporters of the Green Party in Slovakia (SZS). While the 
Meciar government was trusted in March by 34 percent and not 
trusted by 55 percent of respondents, the Moravcik government 
was trusted in April by 54 percent and not trusted by 39 percent 
of those asked. The increase in the trust in the government is 
quite obvious, and it can be safely assumed that those who 
trusted the Meciar government do not trust the Moravcik one, and 
vice versa. 
<H5>  Early Elections </H5>
  The survey indicates that 39 percent of respondents consider 
the date of early elections appropriate, while 24 percent would 
prefer an earlier date, and 15 percent a later one. As many as 
45 percent of respondents in April expected that the HZDS would 
win the elections, 15 percent expected a victory for the SDL, 5 
percent a victory for the Alternative of Political Realism 
(APR), and 4 percent a victory for the Christian Democratic 
Movement [KDH]. It is the supporters of the SDL, KDH, and APR, 
who believe more in a victory for their party than in a victory 
for the HZDS. 
  Who will get the largest number of votes was also linked to 
April party preferences: HZDS -- 32 percent (32 percent of the 
76 percent who intend to participate in the elections, i.e., 24 
percent of all voters); SDL -- 13 percent, KDH -- 8 percent, 
Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
[MKDH] -- 7 percent, APR -- 7 percent, SNS -- 4 percent, 
Democratic Party [DS] -- 3 percent, SDSS [Social Democratic 
Party of Slovakia] -- 3 percent, SZS [Green Party of Slovakia] 
-- 2 percent, ZRS [Association of Workers of Slovakia] -- 2 
percent, AD SR [Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic] -- 
2 percent, NDS-NA [National Democratic Party-New Alternative] -- 
2 percent. 
  The survey makes it possible to determine certain 
characteristics of the voters of individual parties. Thus, for 
instance, HZDS voters are predominantly among people over 60 
years of age (35 percent) and those with only elementary 
education (34 percent), and supported less by people aged 18-24 
(26 percent) and those with university education (25 percent). 
With respect to age, the support for the KDH is similar -- in 
the 18-24 age group only 2 percent would vote for the KDH, while 
in the over-60 group as many as 13 percent would. With the APR, 
on the other hand, the trend regarding education is the reverse 
of that of the HZDS. The APR is preferred by 15 percent of 
university educated respondents, and only by 4 percent of those 
with elementary education. The APR and the SDL are the only 
Slovak parties that also address to a significant degree people 
of Hungarian nationality. From the point of view of sex, the 
SDL deviates from the average (majority of men) and the KDH 
(mostly women). 
  The survey also determined the so-called negative 
preferences, i.e. whom the respondent would not vote for "under 
any circumstances." The most negative preferences went to the 
HZDS and the KDH (22 percent each), followed by the 
Egyutteles-MKDH coalition with 18 percent. The negative 
preferences of the other parties remain under 10 percent. The 
HZDS is clearly in the lead in negative preferences by the 
voters of the KDH, APR, and the Hungarian coalition -- among the 
HZDS voters, it is the KDH, and the SNS voters named the 
Hungarian coalition. As usual, the answers from the voters of 
the SDL are not as clear cut. The first three ranks belong 
without a substantial difference to the KDH and MKDH-Egytteles 
(25 percent each) and the HZDS (24 percent). 
<H5>  Trust in Politicians </H5>
  The three most trustworthy personalities for the citizens of 
the Slovak Republic are -- Meciar (26 percent), and Moravcik and 
M. Kovac (25 percent each). Moravcik's supporters dominate (are 
more numerous than supporters of anyone else) in Bratislava, in 
western Slovakia, among the supporters of the APR, those who do 
not support any party, white collar workers, university and high 
school graduates, citizens of Hungarian ethnic origin, and also 
quite substantially among the SDL and KDH supporters. Meciar's 
supporters dominate in central and eastern Slovakia, among the 
HZDS and SNS voters in the over-60 age group, blue collar 
workers, unemployed, and people with elementary education. 
Kovac's supporters dominate in the 18-24 age group, KDH 
supporters (43 percent as compared with 41 percent for 
Carnogursky), and he also enjoys substantial trust of the SDL 
and APR supporters, citizens of Hungarian ethnic origin, and 
university graduates. 
<H5>  Parliament Estimates </H5>
  In conclusion, one can ask what the structure of the 
parliament would be like assuming that the outcome of the 
elections is the same as that of the survey. To simplify 
matters, let us ignore the undecided voters. The SDL, SDSS, and 
SZS already announced their intention to create a 
social-democratic bloc (SDB), and therefore we will analyze them 
jointly. The APR and AD SR merged into the DEUS [Democratic 
Union of Slovakia]. The composition of the parliament, 
according to the outcome of the survey and without any other 
coalition being formed, would then be as follows: HZDS (65 
deputies), SDB (37 deputies), DEUS (18 deputies), KDH (16 
deputies), MKDH+Egyutteles (14 deputies). The Hungarian 
coalition and the DEUS would have as many deputies as today, the 
KDH almost as many as now, the SNS and NDS would leave the 
parliament, the HZDS would have about as many as it has now 
together with the SNS, and the SDB would improve its position 
from the present state of the SDL. If the parties did not 
change their coalition attitudes, the present government 
coalition would be supported in such a parliament by 85 
deputies, the opposition formed of the HZDS alone would have 65 
deputies. 
  The results of the survey allow for one more conceivable 
alternative -- if the SNS, DS, and NDS went in the parliament 
thanks to some coalition mergers by a ratio corresponding to 
their preferences. In such an event, the HZDS would have 58 
deputies, SDS 33, APR 16, KDH 14, MKDH-Egytteles 13, the SNS 7, 
the DS 5, and the NDS 4 deputies. With the exception of the 
SDB, the number of deputies of all present parliamentary parties 
would slightly decline from the status quo, while the DS, SDSS, 
and the SZS of the non- parliamentary parties would get in. The 
overall ratio between the present coalition and its potential 
allies on the one side, and the opposition (HZDS, SNS) on the 
other side would be in such an instance again 85 to 65. 
  All the aforementioned data indicate that Slovak society 
welcomed in April the change of governments -- albeit moderately 
-- and, with approximately equal strength, refused the return of 
the former set to power and wished for a continuing government 
of the broad coalition also after the elections. Will that also 
be the case in September?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jozef Janto: "Servility Coupled With Naivete"] </F>
  [Text] Hungarian politicians have turned southern Slovakia 
and Bratislava into a place of pilgrimage, especially now, 
before the elections of 8 May. Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) 
Acting Chairman Leszak had the guts to declare, while visiting 
the sovereign Slovak Republic, that Hungarians are being denied 
their basic rights in Slovakia. His colleague from the same 
ruling party even said that covert and almost overt ethnic 
cleansing was taking place in Slovakia. Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) Chairman Horn, who is counting on electoral 
victory, and the chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ), who is also counting on becoming prime minister, were 
more diplomatic. But all of them had one characteristic in 
common: They came here to score points, that is, to play in the 
election campaign the card of the Hungarian ethnic minority. 
  Although gentlemen from the MDF were the most unscrupulous 
in 
playing this card, even in Hungary not everyone wants 
confrontation with their northern neighbor, particularly at a 
time when the Balkans are in flames and the conflict there is 
quite close. That is why Prime Minister Boross also had to 
score points, but, alas, not in the sense of holding much-needed 
businesslike and level-headed talks with Bratislava with the aim 
of concluding agreements accommodating both sides. 
  One has to openly admit that Boross and the entire MDF did 
score points at the meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik 
on Sunday [1 May], a meeting that had already been written off 
because Budapest was not interested in telling the public 
anything about it. The MDF, which, with the support of 8 to 12 
percent of voters, has found itself in fourth place in the 
preelection opinion polls, now has a chance of gaining more 
votes in the elections. It will be assisted by our infinite 
servility, which was coupled in Komarom and Komarno with 
naivete. This was confirmed by Boross himself when he said 
after his talks with Moravcik that he "considered the meeting 
significant for him personally from the long-term point of 
view." While Horn (MSZP) and Kuncze (SZDSZ) had at least given 
Moravcik a formal pledge that they would confirm the 
inviolability of the Slovak-Hungarian border when they became 
head of government, Boross was far from mentioning anything of 
that sort. And he was even given the assurance that the Slovak 
Government would not link the opening of several border 
crossings with the signing of a readmission treaty [providing 
for the repatriation of illegal immigrants]. Slovakia, 
particularly its southern part, could then become a real huge 
promenade.... 
  The aims of the Hungarian politicians, particularly those 
who 
aspire to being future rulers, are obvious. But what, for God's 
sake, was the aim of our government and, in particular, its 
head, who eagerly swallows every Hungarian bait? Supposedly, we 
should show the world that we are acting as good neighbors. 
Every garden and family home owner or tenant surely appreciates 
good relations with his neighbor. Good neighborly relations 
between states are of even much greater value. However, as 
always and everywhere, this must be the aim of both neighbors. 
Whenever Budapest has sought good relations to date, it did so 
only for propaganda reasons. We have the impression that 
Moravcik's government is doing the same thing -- it wants to 
prove that things work better without Meciar. Let us concede 
that they do. In this case, however, servility and naivete could 
backfire ruthlessly.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Media Should Serve the Public"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava -- The UN General Assembly proclaimed 3 
May as International Day of Press Freedom. It is being marked 
for the first time this year, with the support, and 
participation, of the International Federation of Journalists, 
which represents 320,000 journalists from 75 countries, 
including the Slovak Republic. The Slovak Syndicate of 
Journalists [SSN] as a specialized professional and nonpolitical 
organization issued a statement on this occasion, which it made 
available to the TA SR. 
  It states, among other things, that fundamental changes in 
the status of the mass communications media and in the building 
of the independent position of journalists took place in 
Slovakia after November 1989. "In spite of this we observe 
attempts, which we regard as a relapse into past practices, to 
politically control media, which should serve the public and not 
narrow political interests." According to the SSN, this has been 
documented in the last few days by the events surrounding the 
Slovak Television Council. The SSN goes on to draw attention to 
the fact that Slovak Radio is short of 8 million korunas a 
month, even though it has already reduced the number of radio 
stations it operates from three to two. Due to economic 
pressures, Slovak Radio abolished last year 125 permanent posts 
of editors and other creative workers. In the process of 
transformation, the media has found itself in a complicated 
economic situation. The SSN considers it essential that stable 
economic conditions be created for the press, radio, and 
television. A system of support, which is quite common in 
democratic countries, must be established where necessary for 
the democratic and pluralistic operation of the media. The SSN 
regards as optimal a combination of indirect and direct support.

  [Text] During the general parliamentary debate about the 
state budget, Janez Kopac, a deputy of the Liberal Democracy who 
is otherwise the chairman of the parliamentary Finance 
Commission, also pointed out that the adoption of some laws will 
additionally burden the state treasury. Here he, among others, 
singled out the Law on Compensation of Injustices, whose 
financial consequences will amount to several tens of millions 
of German marks. This law has been put into parliamentary 
procedure by the Slovene Peoples' Party [SLS]. For this reason 
our reporter Marjan Rogelj asked Janez Podobnik from the SLS for 
an explanation, while he asked Janez Kopac how the funds would 
be secured if the law, which has already been passed in the 
first reading, will also be implemented: 
  [Begin recording] [Podobnik] The Law on Compensation of 
Injustices should have been passed already. It is incredible 
that Slovenia is finally getting this law after four years of 
diplomacy. As regards the procedure, I think that if the law is 
passed before the parliamentary summer recess, a special 
government working commission will be formed on the basis of the 
law and by the time it is activated and receives its first 
claims, I am convinced that even if the law is passed this year, 
it will in no way burden the 1994 budget. I would like to 
stress once again that we have already compiled a thorough 
calculation. Namely, during the first reading the State Chamber 
ordered us that we must specify the exact total amount of the 
funds and the sources of these funds by the second hearing. 
  [Kopac] Well, the options are either to cut all other 
budgetary obligations for this amount, increase the budget 
deficit, or impose new taxes. There simply is no other way. I 
would add here that I find the reduction of other budgetary 
obligations for this amount unrealistic, as we suffer an acute 
budget crisis anyway. Any increase in debts would be bad for all 
of us and introduction of new taxes is not terribly popular 
either. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] After a three-day session, the State Chamber 
passed the 1994 budget last night. Some 407.6 billion Slovene 
tolars are expected to accumulate in the state treasury, while 
the budget deficit will reach 12.8 billion Slovene tolars, which 
is 0.8 percent of the estimated GNP. The deficit will thus be a 
good billion higher than anticipated and its increase is 
primarily due to the additional funds for the maintenance of 
local and regional highways. All other allocations of funds more 
or less stayed within the proposed limits. [passage omitted]

Republic Square in Belgrade. The SNO said that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal-Democratic Party of 
Russia, was to have addressed the convention. 
  A decree banning the convention, signed by Milos Vukobrat, 
head of the interior affairs department of Belgrade's Stari Grad 
municipality, stresses that the decision was passed because "if 
the meeting goes ahead and there is a breach of public order, 
the safety of people and property will be threatened, and public 
transport will be interrupted." [passage omitted] 
  [Zoran] Atanaskovic [chairman of the SNO executive 
committee] 
said: "We believe that this is a political ban, and the SNO's 
final stance is that the convention will go ahead as planned, 
regardless of whether our appeal to overturn the ban is accepted 
or not." According to him, there have never been any incidents 
at SNO meetings. He added that the party is ready to guarantee 
safety to all participants in the meeting, and that 200 bouncers 
will be provided. 
  Jela Jovanovic, chairman of the SNO's political council, 
confirmed that Zhirinovskiy and his closest aides will arrive 
tomorrow afternoon and spend three days in Belgrade. According 
to her, immediately upon his arrival, Zhirinovskiy will have a 
meeting with republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and 
then hold a news conference in the International Press Center.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 8 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Nikola Sainovic said on Sunday the success of the 
country's economic recovery programme was a heavy blow to 
international sanctions against it. The sanctions were 
originally introduced to cause an economic collapse in 
Yugoslavia, but the programme has prevented this and in this way 
made senseless the very purpose of the sanctions, Sainovic told 
the local radio in Kragujevac. 
  In late May of 1992, the U.N. Security Council introduced 
tough sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its 
alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those who imposed the blockade now see that 
the Yugoslav economy is recovering and that the sanctions are 
also affecting the countries neighbouring on Yugoslavia which 
are allegedly supported by the big powers, said Sainovic. 
  "The positive results of the programme have become evident 
in 
the first 100 days of its implementation, primarily as concerns 
the curbing of hyperinflation and revival of production." The 
basic goal now is to sustain production growth and ensure 
revival of the overall economic activity, explained Sainovic. 
  The economic recovery programme, which was launched on 
January 24, slashed inflation to zero. Before the programme was 
introduced, the monthly inflation in Yugoslavia soared to the 
unbelievable 310 million percent. One of the effects of the 
sanctions was a sharp drop in industrial production which was 
reversed after the programme was introduced. In February, 
industrial output rose by 12.4 percent on the January figure and 
in March by 21.3 percent. 
  The architect of the Yugoslav economic recovery programme is 
Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, 77, who for decades worked with the 
World Bank and other U.N. specialized agencies. Dr. Avramovic is 
currently governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.

  [Editorial Report] Speaking to Radio Kragujevac on 3 April, 
leaders of four parties represented in the Serbian Assembly, 
including President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party of 
Serbia, unanimously agreed that "the political integration of 
the former Yugoslav community is impossible, but the 
establishment of economic, agricultural, transportation, 
cultural, and other relations is not only possible but, in fact, 
indispensable." This was reported in the Belgrade daily BORBA of 
4 April, together with excerpts of the party leaders' 
statements, in an article titled "Renewal of Yugoslavia 
Impossible." 
  Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, is cited 
as observing that the regions that formerly constituted the 
state of Yugoslavia should strive to establish the "firmest 
links possible" as long as each of the areas retains its 
independence "in the political and every other sense." 
  Vuk Draskovic, leader of Serbian Renewal Movement, points 
out 
that "there is no such thing as the reintegration of Yugoslavia; 
this gossip is spread by those opposition parties whose power 
was based on hatred, war, killing, and refugees." He adds, 
however, that economic, transportation, and cultural links must 
be established "on the territory that was once Yugoslavia," 
noting that it does not make sense to travel to Sarajevo through 
Frankfurt. 
  Vojislav Kostunica, president of the Democratic Party of 
Serbia, stresses that "there are both contemporary and 
historical factors making it impossible to create a new Yugoslav 
state community." 
  Borislav Jovic, vice president of the Socialist Party of 
Serbia, points out that the Serbs were the only nation 
interested in preserving Yugoslavia before the war, but now, 
after the war, they are against it. The Serbian people's 
opposition, according to Jovic, was demonstrated during the last 
elections because "the parties that talk about a new Yugoslavia 
did not gain a single seat in the republic's parliament." Jovic 
further stresses that the Serbs are for a "reduced" Yugoslavia, 
but not for Yugoslavia as it was in the past. He also agrees 
that the Serbs should establish economic, commercial, 
ecological, and cultural relations with their neighbors on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia.

    [Editorial Report] Several articles in recent issues of the 
Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI have examined problems with the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's new dinar, the value of which 
is supposed to be pegged to the German mark [DM]. A shortage of 
the foreign currency that serves as the dinar's backing and an 
abundance of dinars, combined with aggressive illegal money 
markets, are eroding the new dinar's value. The "culprits" are 
not only illegal street dealers, but also some legitimate 
businessmen. The government is considering various remedies 
ranging from a gold-backed dinar to arrests of currency dealers. 
The paper indicates that the problem is widespread, occurring in 
numerous cities in Serbia and Montenegro. 
  According to an article entitled "Dinar Being Tested" in the 
10 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI, "the inability of the state to fight 
successfully against the unregulated sale of hard currency is 
due, first of all, to the fact that hard currency reserves have 
been depleted and that the stabilization program started with 
about DM300 million, an amount that was actually insufficient. 
That much was purchased during the first two months of the 
program, and since then demand has exceeded supply." 
  The shortage of hard currency, which undermines the new 
dinar, is not caused by ordinary citizens, states an article in 
the 9 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI. The main culprits are the private 
dealers who line up daily at the banks to buy hard currency. 
"Sales of marks and dollars by banks and exchange offices far 
surpass purchases. `Agrobanka' of Podgorica, for example, sold 
6,000 marks while it bought 800. The situation is similar in 
other banks." 
  Dealers are playing for larger stakes on the streets, 
reports 
VECERNJE NOVOSTI on 5 April: "They don't bother with small 
change any more. Now they offer 110 dinars for DM100, 1,200 
dinars for DM1,000, and 2,500 `super' dinars for DM2,000." 
Aggravating the erosion of the dinar and the depletion of hard 
currency, the paper adds, are dealers from Bulgaria and Romania 
who offer 1.2 to 1.5 dinars for a mark. The greatest damage is 
done by large-volume dealers who work with tens and hundreds of 
thousands of marks, according to a 6 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI 
article, which reports that two groups of dealers were recently 
arrested in Belgrade for transactions totaling DM750,000. Most 
of these people are owners of businesses, the paper notes. 
  The article goes on to examine where all the dinars are 
coming from. Milorad Vlakovic, director of Plevlje Bank, 
believes that many dealers are buying marks for various 
businesses, which thus convert their daily dinar profits into 
hard currency. It notes that while such transactions may be a 
major source of dinars, they are not the only ones. It cites a 
TANJUG report that "yesterday morning in Podgorica, several 
dealers had several thousand new dinars each. These dinars were 
in their original bank wrappers, stacked according to their 
serial numbers." The article adds that in Montenegro one type of 
business takes a direct approach in collecting hard currency. 
Service stations sell gasoline strictly for hard currency. This 
is legal in Montenegro, and it forces many people to buy hard 
currency in order to obtain gasoline. 
  An article entitled "It Costs Less in Marks" in VECERNJE 
NOVOSTI of 10 April notes that many products sell on the black 
market for as much as a 30 percent discount if they are paid for 
in marks rather than dinars. These items include electronics 
products, clothing, cosmetics, and some imported foods. The 
article also reports on measures such as cameras in banks and 
identity checks that are intended to prevent repeated purchases 
of hard currecny by the same individuals. Such measures are 
easily defeated, the paper observes; dealers simply send proxies 
to the banks. The 9 April VECERNJE NOVISTI reports that banks in 
the city of Zajecar have found a more effective way to avoid 
depletion of their foreign currency supplies: They sell only as 
much foreign currency as they buy. 
  The Belgrade Institute of Economy has proposed that the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia introduce gold coins weighing four 
grams and valued at 92 dinars as a way of reducing the number of 
dinars in circulation, states the 10 April VECERNJE NOVOSTI 
article. The institute has also proposed the introduction of 
special-product bonds. To deny currency dealers access to dinars 
intended for the purchase of the wheat crop, for example, bonds 
redeemable for wheat would be issued. The paper concludes, 
however, that in spite of the efforts to ensure the stability of 
the new dinar, "bankers are already talking about devaluation."

    [Editorial Report] Three articles in two recent issues of 
the Belgrade weekly VREME discuss the public admission by Nikola 
Pejakovic, Montenegrin minister of internal affairs, that Serb 
and Muslim refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina had been deported 
from Montenegro to Serbian-held territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  VREME's 4 April issue published a letter dated 18 September 
1992 written by Pejakovic in response to an inquiry by Daniela 
Stupar-Titoric, a Bosnia- Herzegovina refugee in Montenegro, 
about the fate of her husband. In the letter Pejakovic admitted 
to Stupar-Titoric that her husband, Alemko Titoric, from Novo 
Sarajevo, had been arrested in Herceg Novi, Montenegro, on 26 
May 1992 together with 34 other persons, and, at the request of 
the republic of Srpska [RS], the self-proclaimed Serb state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, handed over to Srebrenica Secretariat of 
Internal Affairs [SUP] officials, who in turn handed the 
refugees over to Bosnian Muslim military police at the 
Territorial Defense headquarters in Bratunac in exchange for RS 
prisoners. Pejakovic stated in the letter that he had no other 
information on the fate of the deported individuals. 
  The 11 April issue of VREME contended that Pejakovic's 
letter 
finally confirmed the suspicions of the Montenegrin opposition 
that what is at issue are "acts that have the character of war 
crimes against a civilian population." The weekly noted that 
opposition delegates in the Montenegrin Assembly had been 
demanding an investigation of the deportation of refugees since 
the "first half of 1992." These demands contributed to the 
"satanization" of the opposition in the Montenegrin press, VREME 
said, adding that the press viewed the arrested individuals as 
"Alija's fighters and perpetrators of diversionary tactics" who 
"came to Montenegro disguised as refugees" intending to "provoke 
a war in this area." In talks with opposition party delegations, 
however, Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic gave his 
assurance that the deportation of refugees would cease and that 
each case would be investigated, VREME reported, adding that a 
parliamentary commission had been formed to conduct an 
investigation. VREME listed the names of 85 ethnic Muslim and 
Serb deportees who it said were identified by Pejakovic in his 
April 1993 official response to the parliamentary commission. 
According to the information provided by Pejakovic, groups of 
refugees were turned over to the republic of Srpska on 19, 24, 
25, and 27 May 1992. 
  The same issue of VREME criticized the deportation of 
refugees and cited a statement by Nebojsa Vucinic, professor at 
the law faculty of the university in Podgorica, that "what is at 
issue is the violation of the Convention on the Status of 
Refugees, which Yugoslavia signed and ratified.... The basic 
right of refugees is that they not be returned to the state from 
which they escaped and in which their lives are in danger.... 
The basic duty of a state is to offer protection to the 
refugees, and if someone among them has committed a war crime or 
a crime against humanity, he is to answer before a regular court 
and through regular court proceedings." 
  VREME also quoted Stevan Lilic, professor of constitutional 
law at Belgrade University, who viewed Pejakovic's letter to 
Daniela Stupar-Titoric as "proof of the clinical death of a 
legal state." Lilic stated that the police violated both the 
Constitution of Montenegro and the Constitution and Criminal 
Code of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. He cited 
Article 23 of the FRY Constitution, which maintains that no one 
should be deprived of freedom except persons who have committed 
criminal acts; Article 154 of the Criminal Code of Yugoslavia, 
which calls for a five-year prison sentence for persons who 
violate human rights on the basis of ethnic, racial, or other 
differences; and Article 142 of the Code, according to which the 
taking of hostages is considered a war crime. Lilic asked: "Is 
the Montenegrin Ministry of Internal Affairs in the service of 
the republic of Srpska, and is Montenegro conducting on its 
territory a manhunt for people of another state and on behalf of 
that state? Thus, a state is violating its own constitution in 
order to do a service for another state.... This act is not only 
unconstitutional, it is totally immoral." 
  VREME maintains that Pejakovic's "cool public admission" of 
the deportation amounts to an attempt to institutionalize 
lawlessness and to proclaim the manhunt for refugees a normal 
police procedure. Thus, the weekly concludes, this kind of 
lawlessness could be repeated again and again.

  [Text] Pristina, 6 May (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova, 
president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [DSK], today 
described his talks in Pristina yesterday with British Foreign 
Office minister Douglas Hogg as "rather important and 
successful." At a news conference, Rugova recalled Hogg's 
statement that Great Britain will make efforts to resolve the 
problem of Kosovo and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. 
Commenting on Hogg's statement that Kosovo is part of Serbia 
and that the Albanians can only count on autonomy, he said: "We 
discussed all issues with the British Foreign Office minister. 
From the international point of view he has no authority or 
power to make any suggestions about what Kosovo is part of." 
  "Mr. Hogg came here primarily in good faith and with the 
intention of exploring the possibility of a Serbian-Albanian 
dialogue," the DSK leader said. Asked about the possibility of 
establishing a dialogue with representatives of the Serbian 
authorities, Rugova said: "We have had no information about 
this." He described all talk about the possible beginning of 
talks as speculation. To a reporter's comment that "Serbia is 
ready for certain concessions to normalize the situation in 
Kosovo," Rugova said ambiguously: "We will see what concessions 
we are talking about." 
  In the context of what he usually calls the daily repression 
of Albanians by the Serbian authorities, Rugova mentioned the 
crime in the Mladenovac barracks, describing it as "an incident 
which reflects the games and insinuations surrounding ethnic 
Albanian soldiers in the Yugoslav Army." Instead of condemning 
the crime, Rugova condemned the military authorities and said 
they are allegedly asking for financial compensation to release 
soldiers of Albanian nationality from the Yugoslav Army.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with President Vaclav Havel by </F>
Robert Tamchyna in Prague on 7 May -- recorded; from the 
"Conversations at Lany" program] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tamchyna] It is likely that 
some people felt a shiver down their spine just a week ago when 
on Sunday at the May Day rally organized by the Communist Party 
of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] its Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek 
called for actions by individual citizens going as far as civic 
disobedience. [passage omitted] 
  [Havel] I would like to say that the principle of civic 
disobedience as such is a respectable form of defense by a group 
of citizens in the conditions of a dictatorship, apartheid, and 
so forth. In my view there is neither room, motive, nor logical 
reason for such a principle of disobedience in a democracy where 
power has really come from the people -- in free elections. 
  It also strikes me as somewhat alarming that this view is 
voiced by an official of the party which has on many occasions 
throughout its history proved its opposition to democracy. I 
wonder if this appeal is not a harking back to the communist 
methods of conquering power. 
  [Tamchyna] I hope it will not sound too lofty if I say that 
all the world's eyes have over the past few days been focused 
primarily on the Republic of South Africa [RSA], where the first 
multiracial elections are over and the results known, and 
probably no one expected those results and the new division of 
political forces to solve all the problems of the Republic of 
South Africa. My question is probably something like this: Will 
the new political structure of the Republic of South Africa be 
able to appreciate the concept of democracy not only in terms of 
its advantages and rights but also with all the duties and 
responsibilities it entails? 
  [Havel] The process of national liberation and extrication 
from white domination is a logical, legitimate, and lawful one 
which has taken place throughout the world, and I think that the 
fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa is cause for 
universal delight. The Republic of South Africa naturally faces 
a difficult time ahead. All countries which freed themselves 
from colonial domination have experienced and are still 
experiencing difficult times, but they probably do have to pass 
through this phase. 
  Since you are asking me, I would like to take the 
opportunity 
to praise the achievements of President de Klerk, who at one 
time paid an official visit to our country during which we 
talked at length. He really is a courageous man. He has made a 
decisive contribution to these changes. He was well aware that 
after putting into effect the changes he is now instituting and 
which he considers to be right, he would lose the presidential 
office. But he put justice before his own position. I think he 
is a man who deserves worldwide recognition and who was rightly 
awarded the Nobel prize. By this I do not mean to say that 
Nelson Mandela did not deserve it. All that remains for me to 
wish him is that, if he is indeed elected president at the 
beginning of next week, he might lead his country wisely through 
the period which awaits it. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] At the proposal of the government, 
President Vaclav Havel has appointed three officers of the Czech 
Army to the rank of first general. On this occasion he 
delivered a speech marking the 49th anniversary of liberation 
from fascism. We now present the full version of this address. 
  [Begin Havel recording] Gentlemen, veterans, esteemed fellow 
citizens! Voices pointing to various possible external dangers 
and demanding that politicians should pay more attention to the 
security of our state and to a faster building of a system of 
security ties with the democratic world are beginning to appear 
in our part of the world and from time to time even in our 
country. 
  These voices, even though they may often be out of 
proportion 
to the situation, do nevertheless, testify to a certain fact. 
They are evidence of a certain disquiet, of a feeling of 
uncertainty, and of concerns that four years after renewing its 
independence, our comparatively small country, which is moreover 
situated in an exposed position, is still finding itself in too 
much of a vacuum, because its belonging to the West has still 
not been properly, or if your like, institutionally, confirmed. 
By adopting a cautious approach, by having an aversion to 
changes and fear of new things, the West allegedly keeps 
showering on us uncertain promises rather than tangible deeds 
and our politicians are allegedly accepting this situation with 
too much ease. I am not going to evaluate now to what degree 
these opinions are or are not justified. I will rather 
concentrate on bringing to your attention what we ourselves must 
do if we wish to reinforce our own certainties. 
  The appropriate international talks aimed at our speedy and 
firm incorporation into the political, economic, and security 
structures of the democratic world are being conducted almost on 
a daily basis. Perhaps they could be conducted with an even 
greater urgency. But this approach itself is far from being 
enough. I think it is far more important that we, as a society, 
are capable of expressing through concrete deeds our 
willingness, will, and courage to both defend our own freedom 
and independence and to participate in the joint international 
defense of democratic values anywhere where they are being 
trampled on. 
  The point is that no one will give us any security 
guarantees 
unless he is sure that we ourselves are capable of defending our 
country and, at the same time, we take on the broader 
responsibility we are demanding from others. 
  An international alliance is not and cannot be based on a 
unilateral action, which means that the task of one side is to 
render all-round help, while others are here to be helped. In 
other words, we ourselves must not refuse to take risks and make 
sacrifices and at the same time, ask others to run risks and 
make sacrifices because of us. The advantages of freedom, 
independence, and development cannot be enjoyed while 
responsibility for their defense is delegated to others. 
  I think that our modern history offers quite a lot of 
evidence of the fact that freedom is not a gift that is fought 
for and that is later handed out by the powerful of this world, 
but that only he, who himself is working toward winning and 
defending it is able to win or defend it. [passage omitted] 
  Thanks to the entire set of historical circumstances we 
fortunately did not have to wage an armed struggle to liberate 
ourselves from Communism. But this does not at all mean that 
all has been taken care of forever and that we do not need to 
worry about our security any more. Unfortunately, we do not, 
and will hardly ever live in such an ideal world. After all, 
the will to get involved in the struggle for justice and peace 
demonstrated by our units in the Persian Gulf and in the former 
Yugoslavia has given a considerable boost to the respect our 
state enjoys on the international arena today. [(passage 
omitted] 
  Today, the day when we recall the end of the Second World 
War, I greet on behalf of all my fellow citizens our war 
veterans. I greet those present in this hall and all other 
veterans, including those living abroad. I greet them as people 
to whom we owe our present freedom, I greet them as people who 
should be an inspiration for our entire army. In appointing new 
generals today, I am guided by the conviction that they are 
aware of this example and that their work will enhance the 
credibility of our army. 
  The great changes that have taken place in our army in the 
recent years testify to the loyalty and professional attitude of 
career soldiers. I believe that our army will successfully 
continue the work that has begun. The credibility of our 
republic, or in other words, the credibility of all of us, 
depends to a considerable degree on its loyalty and credibility. 
Providing our army is ready to defend at any time the values we 
enjoy today, and providing this readiness is based on the 
general support by society, the society that is aware that evil 
must be fought even with arms, we do not have to fear for our 
security and we do not have to fear that in case we are 
threatened, others will fail to show their solidarity for us. 
Gentlemen, I congratulate you on your appointment. War 
veterans, thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["(joe)"-signed report: "The Army: The Number of Interested </F>
Parties Is Increasing, the Number of Apartments Has Declined"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Almost 1,000 people have shown an 
interest in serving in the rapid deployment brigade since the 
start of the Czech Army's recruitment drive. Defense Minister 
A. Baudys said at yesterday's news conference that this is 
approximately one-third of the number required for this unit, 
which should have 3,000 men. Not all applicants, however, meet 
the standards required. The minister also referred to the talks 
with representatives from the Slovak Army, with which the Czech 
Army has concluded an agreement on mutual cooperation, and the 
talks concerning the Partnership for Peace plan. However, 
instead of a meeting involving the Visegrad Group defense 
ministers, which was proposed by the Slovak side, A. Baudys 
thinks it is more purposeful to hold expert consultations on 
specific common issues. 
  The minister praised the recent government decision that 
enables the Czech Army to sell surplus military materials and 
property in its ownership. Baudys estimated the book value of 
the discarded materials to be 1 billion korunas [Kc]; however, 
he pointed out that this often involves property that it is 
difficult to sell. The property is offered to the state 
administration and, as long as the right of first option is not 
utilized, it is sold at auction by real estate agencies. The 
facilities vacated by the Czech Army in the cities are usually 
turned into apartments for soldiers. Thus, the army is 
partially resolving the situation whereby -- by the adoption of 
the new housing law -- it lost, according to A. Baudys, the 
right to administer roughly 30,000 apartments. The Czech Army 
contributed Kc1.8 billion to the state budget last year by 
selling its property. At the same time, the cost of protecting 
and upkeeping its property, which placed a burden on the Army -- 
that is, on the state budget -- has been reduced. 
  [Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech on 4 May on page 2, under the 
headline "The Public Can Be Unconcerned," carries the following 
"(jis)"-signed report: "According to Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys, all the viral strains kept by the Army have been 
destroyed. He issued an order to destroy the viruses in February 
on the basis of a recommendation from an interdepartmental 
commission made up of experts from the Army and the Health 
Ministry. It had come to the conclusion that it was not 
necessary to continue to store the viruses. The commission's 
task is to assess all the materials on the research work carried 
out in the Czech Republic with various bacteriological 
materials."]

<F P=106> ["(pes)"-signed report: "Exports From Our Republic Have </F>
Declined This Year"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The Czech Republic's foreign trade 
turnover during the first three months of this year increased by 
4.8 percent compared with the same period of 1993; of this, 
imports rose by 15.9 percent and exports fell by 4.3 percent. 
This is apparent from the figures released by the Czech 
Statistical Office. 
  States with an advanced market economy had a 60.8-percent 
share in the republic's overall foreign trade turnover (European 
Union states had a 42.8-percent share and European Free Trade 
Association [EFTA] states had a 12.3-percent share). The Slovak 
Republic accounted for 15.2 percent; the countries of the former 
Soviet Union for 10.3 percent; developing countries for 7.3 
percent; European states with a transitional economy (excluding 
the countries of the former USSR) for 5.6 percent; and states 
with a state-controlled trading system for 0.8 percent. 
  Imports in all categories rose. However, imports from 
Slovakia fell by 16.6 percent compared with the January-March 
period of 1993. Imports from states with a state-controlled 
trading system (index 144.2) and from European states with a 
transitional economy, excluding the countries of the former 
USSR, (index 132.7) rose most dynamically. 
  Despite the overall decline in exports, exports to EFTA 
states (index 161.6) rose. This was mainly due to the dynamism 
of our exports to Austria (index 169.0). Exports to Austria 
accounted for almost 10 percent of the Czech Republic's overall 
exports. Exports to developing countries (index 120.8) 
continued to increase. The most substantial decline in exports 
-- apart from exports to states with a state-controlled trading 
system, which, however, have a small share in overall exports -- 
was to Slovakia. Exports to Slovakia reached only 66.5 percent 
of the level for the first quarter of 1993, which represents a 
reduction of 6.6 billion korunas [Kc]. 
  Imports from OECD countries during the first quarter 
amounted 
to Kc48.6 billion and exports amounted to Kc54.9 billion. The 
balance of trade was in the black by Kc6.3 billion. Compared 
with the same period last year, imports from OECD countries rose 
by 23 percent and exports to these countries rose by 13.8 
percent. 
  The balance of trade for the first three months of 1994 
showed a surplus of Kc1.7 billion. A surplus was achieved in 
trade with all territories, except the former Soviet Union, 
where there was a deficit of Kc8.5 billion. The surplus with 
European Union states amounted to Kc4.4 billion; with developing 
countries to Kc3.4 billion; with EFTA states to Kc1.3 billion; 
with European states with a transitional economy (excluding the 
countries of the former USSR) to Kc0.6 billion; and with states 
with a state-controlled trading system to Kc0.3 billion. 
  In overall imports from January to March 1994, the Federal 
Republic of Germany had a 23.1-percent share; the Slovak 
Republic had a 15-percent share; and Russia had a 13.8-percent 
share. Imports from Brazil (a 0.3-percent share in overall 
imports), Canada (0.7 percent), South Korea (0.6 percent), China 
(0.6 percent), Denmark (1.0 percent), and Switzerland (2.1 
percent) grew most rapidly compared with the same period last 
year. Imports from Egypt and Bulgaria fell. 
  During the same period, 29.1 percent of the Czech Republic's 
exports went to the Federal Republic of Germany. Some 15.5 
percent went to Slovakia; 9.8 percent to Austria; 3.2 percent to 
the United Kingdom; and 3.2 percent to Russia. Compared with 
the January-March period of 1993, exports to Turkey (a 1.9 
percent share in overall exports); Japan (1.5 percent); Taiwan 
(0.4 percent); Hong Kong (1.6 percent); and Brazil (0.1 percent) 
increased most. Exports to China, Denmark, Romania, and 
Slovenia declined considerably. 
  From January to March 1994, in the structure of imports 
according to the categories of goods, the percentage of imports 
of machinery and means of transportation declined by 3.5 points 
compared with the same period last year. The percentage of 
imports of fuels and raw and processed materials in overall 
imports rose by 2.6 points and the percentage of industrial 
consumer goods rose by 0.9 points. The percentage of imports of 
foodstuffs remained the same. The value of imports, compared 
with the first quarter of last year, increased for all 
categories of goods. During the first three months of 1994, 1.7 
million tonnes of oil (1.5 million tonnes during the same period 
last year) and 3.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas (1.7 
billion cubic meters last year) were imported. 
  During the first quarter of 1994, in the structure of 
exports 
according to the categories of goods, the percentage of imports 
of fuels and raw and processed materials and industrial consumer 
goods rose by 2.1 and 3.0 points respectively compared with the 
same period last year. On the other hand, the percentage of 
exports of machinery and means of transport declined by 2.4 
points and foodstuffs declined by 2.7 points. Compared with the 
first three months of 1993, only exports in the industrial goods 
category rose, by 19.1 percent.

    [Editorial Report] A recent OECD study of the Czech economy 
positively assesses its current condition and foresees continued 
improvement. The OECD report, which was summarized in the 25 
March edition of the Prague business daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, 
credits the Czech Republic's recent success in part to its 
"surprisingly smooth" separation from its former sister republic 
and to the stabilization and privatization policies of the 
government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The report notes that 
the Czechs have succeeded in compensating for a sharp decline in 
sales to Slovakia since the separation by increasing exports to 
Western countries by 19.5 percent last year, while, at the same 
time, allowing imports from the West to rise by only 5.2 percent. 
  The OECD experts attribute the Czech Republic's abilities to 
maintain strong foreign currency reserves and to achieve a 
favorable trade balance to its exceptionally stable fiscal and 
monetary policies and its low inflation rate. They warn, 
however, that the Czech Government should exercise caution with 
its wage regulation policy, even though this acts as a brake on 
inflation, because pent-up demand for wage increases could 
eventually lead to an explosive situation, especially in areas 
of labor shortages. 
  The OECD report praises the Klaus government's 
coupon-privatization policy for permitting the rapid 
privatization of over 36 percent of state-owned properties 
without arousing popular discontent, but it warns that the 
government's efforts to keep down the rate of bankruptcies (only 
20 were declared in the first five months after the government's 
new bankruptcy law went into effect in mid-1993) could backfire 
as the number of insolvent firms accumulates. 
  The general macroeconomic picture is seen as promising, 
aided 
by a balanced government budget, a foreign-payments surplus, and 
the neutral monetary policy of the Czech National Bank. 
Industrial production is expected to increase, although only at 
a modest rate, while growth of 2 percent in 1994 and 5 percent 
in 1995 is predicted for the overall GDP. Nevertheless, 
unemployment will probably increase as the expected wave of 
bankruptcies starts to have an impact. (A study by the Vienna 
Institute for Comparative Economic Studies also warns of 
increasing unemployment this year, according to the 6 April 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. The Vienna Institute attributes the current 
low unemployment rate to a sharp drop in the size of the labor 
force, from 5.7 million in 1989 to a current 4.8 million. The 
drop is mainly the result of ending the artificially high 
work-force participation rate of 87 percent under the communist 
regime and of absorbing displaced industrial and agricultural 
workers in the rapidly developing service sector. The study sees 
both of these trends as essentially played out, making a 
doubling of the unemployment rate possible in 1994.) 
  The OECD experts said they expect a small surplus in the 
1994 
balance of payments, particularly due to net income from 
services and tourism. They warn, however, that this surplus may 
drop to near zero in 1995 as a result of increasing imports due 
to an expanding economy and continuing improvement in living 
standards. Their report notes that foreign currency reserves of 
$6.5 billion have been accumulated so far. (This was criticized 
by economic journalist Jan Kukacka, who described the foreign 
currency reserves as "dead" capital that is not being used for 
economic development and must, on the contrary, be "subsidized" 
by Czech citizens because it earns no interest and leads to 
higher prices. Writing in the 5 April HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, 
Kukacka also suggested that the surplus could be an indication 
of undervalued currency, a conclusion that was also reached in 
the Vienna Institute study.)

  [Text] The implementation of the Washington Agreement was 
one of the topics discussed at the talks in Zagreb this evening 
between Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and Iranian 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who was accompanied by the 
Deputy Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri. After the talks, the two 
ministers made statements. Albino Cehic has a report. 
  [Begin Velayati recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have already concluded very 
friendly talks with his excellency the prime minister of 
Croatia, and we are happy that, less than a week after his visit 
to Iran, we had an opportunity to come to Croatia to implement 
what we signed in Tehran. This evening we remembered what we 
signed and, in addition to bilateral relations, we would like to 
include Bosnia as well, in order to establish tripartite 
cooperation between Iran, Bosnia, and Croatia. [end recording] 
  [Cehic] This evening's meeting is also important because we 
have just come back from Sarajevo where we had useful talks with 
the Bosnian leaders and Alija Izetbegovic. We hope that Croatia 
and Bosnia will find a way to implement the agreement they 
signed recently. I believe that the future of Croatia and Iran, 
Minister Velayati stressed, lies primarily in the strengthening 
of bilateral cooperation between our and your country. Prime 
Minister Valentic had the following to say to reporters: 
  [Begun Valentic recording] This is the continuation of the 
very concrete talks we began in Tehran, primarily on bilateral 
relations, and, even more importantly, on tripartite relations 
between Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran, and Croatia. I think that 
very soon our three countries will form a joint economic 
commission, in order to make joint appearance in the world -- 
especially, as I have already said, in Islamic countries where 
we believe that mixed Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatian companies 
can obtain considerable financial projects. 
  In the same way, Iran's help and support are important in 
the 
implementation of the agreement on the [Muslim-Croat] 
federation. We agreed that the federation is important, 
primarily for Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, but also for Croatia as a 
directly interested neighboring state, and a state which is 
concerned about its people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it is also 
important for Iran as a state. Croatia attaches great 
importance to that, and we will continue developing bilateral 
and tripartite relations. [end recording]

  [Text] Knin, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Discussing the situation 
around Brcko, the Supreme Defense Council of the Republic of 
Serb Krajina [RSK] said in Knin today that the defense of the 
corridor was vital for the Serbian nation west of the Drina 
River. In this context, the council has sent its full support 
to the people and the leadership of the republic of Srpska 
making it clear that the RSK was prepared to help in the 
corridor's defense, as it did when the corridor was established. 
The RSK Supreme Defense Council expressed support for the 
efforts to prevent clashes near Brcko by deploying UN monitors, 
pointing out that the corridor has to remain an integral part of 
the Serb ethnic territory because of its importance, and that 
this was not negotiable.

  [Text] Jagodina, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Branko Vojnica, 
president of the Assembly of the Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], 
said today that the statement made by German diplomat Horst 
Weisel [German ambassador in Croatia] after yesterday's meeting 
between the European Union [EU] ambassadorial troika and the RSK 
leadership that "Krajina remains within Croatia's borders" was 
an unambiguous declaration of support for Croatia's policies, 
views, and demands that could jeopardize everything accomplished 
so far. 
  "Such a conspicuous remark will certainly turn Croatian 
President Tudjman and his officials into even greater hawks and 
encourage them to attempt, as they say, to reintegrate Krajina 
into their constitutional and legal system by force if need be," 
Vojnica told Radio Jagodina. "This continuous pressure does not 
surprise us, just as we are not deluding ourselves that it will 
not become even more complex and even stronger," Vojnica said. 
He stressed that the EU is evidently in a hurry to promote its 
interests in this area before the United States does. 
  "The EU has hinted at such a solution and has now announced 
it publicly, ignoring our right to self-determination on the 
basis of the UN Charter and the will of the Serb people 
expressed at the referendum. The Serbs decided not to live in 
Croatia because that state had erased them from its 
Constitution", Vojnica said. "The Serb people in Krajina have 
managed to defend themselves against their Croat neighbors and 
their overlords, and they will also defend their right to 
self-determination. They have elected their legitimate bodies 
of authority that will work in the interest of the people and 
will not back off from our basic demands," the RSK Assembly 
president said.

  [Text] [Announcer] The 30th international meeting of 
tourism journalists has begun in Makarska. The meeting is 
attended by about 150 journalists, including as many as 100 
foreign reporters. The meeting was opened by Minister of 
Tourism Niko Bulic. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and Ivica 
Mudrinic, minister of maritime affairs, transport and 
communications also attended. Jadran Marinkovic reports from 
Makarska: 
  [Marinkovic] Tourism is Croatia's main branch of the 
economy. 
That is our commitment and economic priority, Prime Minister 
Nikica Valentic said in Makarska today. Last year we earned 1 
billion German marks [DM] from tourism, and this year we will 
double that figure. However, our final goal is for that sum to 
reach 5 or 6 billion marks in the near future. There will be no 
more war on Croatian territory, Prime Minister Valentic said 
resolutely. Many questions by journalists from 12 European 
countries focused on the safety of our coast and relations with 
the local Serbs, that is, the occupied areas. Mr. Valentic had 
the following to say about this: 
  [Begin Valentic recording] Croatia has done and is still 
doing everything to solve the problem of the occupied areas and 
the reintegration of those Croatian areas into Croatia's 
constitutional and legal system by peaceful means, without war. 
I can assure you that Croatia has enough economic power and 
military might to liberate those area by military means. The 
Croatian Government and the Croatian state will not resort to 
those methods. We will do everything -- although that takes 
more time and stirs certain unrest among our population -- in 
order to reintegrate those areas exclusively by peaceful means. 
  We have the world's support in doing this. On behalf of the 
Croatian Government, I guarantee you that there will be no war 
on the Croatian territory because the Croatian Government will 
not resort to force to solve that problem. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Vodopija: "A Lecture From Sarajevo"] </F>
  [Text] I have done everything I could, I have done my 
best, U.S. President Bill Clinton said, cornered by unpleasant 
questions by CNN's top journalist, Christiane Amanpour from 
Sarajevo. I did expect to be given lectures from Sarajevo... 
because this poor woman has seen the horrors of that war. She 
is wonderful and has done a great favor to the entire world and 
I do not reproach her for being angry, Clinton said at the end 
of his 90-minute confrontation with CNN reporters in Sarajevo, 
Jerusalem, Seoul, Johannesburg, and the Carter Center in Atlanta 
with some eminent journalists from all over the world. Clinton 
left a medium impression: His speech was full of cliches, two 
studios remarked that he dealt insufficiently with specific and 
concrete issues, he was humorous twice, made no major gaffes 
(Wolf Blitzer of CNN), and was better with domestic topics such 
as trade with Japan or Latin America than with Bosnia (Ralph 
Baker of CNN). 
  The U.S. President showed that U.S. foreign policy has been 
torn apart into various sides, that it begins much but completes 
little, and that it does not use same criteria for similar 
crises in the world. Clinton pointed out the three priorities 
of U.S. foreign policy: security, economic progress, and 
democracy. Haiti was exhausted as the first topic of the 
program and then came Bosnia. Belgrade Television Journalist 
Miodrag Ilic, who popped up from somewhere, wanted to know 
whether the United States will change its strategy toward Bosnia 
and treat the warring sides equally instead of "satanizing the 
Serbs through the media" and when the sanctions on Serbia will 
be lifted. Unlike the generalized answers that he gave to the 
majority of other questions, Clinton was surprisingly concrete. 
The short answer was as follows: "No," the U.S. President 
said, "at least as long as the negotiations are under way." He 
openly said that the embargo on weapons for former Yugoslavia 
had become a joke, as it gave a huge strategic advantage to the 
Serbs and their heavy artillery and made ethnic cleansing easier. 
  With her questions, Christiane Amanpour was beating Clinton 
down. She asked why he, as the leader of the free world, needed 
so long to articulate his policy toward Bosnia, why the West and 
the United States were hostages to those with a clear policy 
(the Bosnian Serbs), why he, with his vacillating policy, was 
setting a dangerous precedent that may make Kim Il-song and 
similar potentates take him less seriously than he would like. 
A frustrated Clinton provided a nervous and weak reply, but he 
nevertheless managed somehow to smoothe out the dispute with 
Christiane. In an extensive excuse for vacillating about 
Bosnian problem, Clinton said something that could be of 
interest to Croatia as well. In the case of Bosnia, we have no 
control over the situation, we only have influence, the U.S. 
President said. 
  During his speech Clinton mentioned Croatia only once and 
that was only in passing, while speaking about Bosnia. However, 
it is important to be aware of the part about control in this 
case too. Namely, somebody who controls a certain territory has 
control and the U.S. influence can, albeit does not have to, be 
a weight that will help him extend his control to those 
territories that he temporarily loses. This is important so 
that one can bring down to earth the people who thought that if 
things get even worse, the U.S. cavalry will invariably ride in 
to help. It might come in the form of strong diplomatic or 
military support, but not to aid the weak, but to help the 
strong. 
  Another link with Croatia can be discerned in Clinton's 
reply 
to a Palestinian journalist's question concerning help for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. Two billion dollars 
have already been waiting and the U.S. Administration will 
prompt Jewish and Arab lobbies in the United States to invest 
private capital the moment they see the peace is being 
respected. The message to Croatia would read as follows: 
Consistent respect for the Washington Agreement and Croatia's 
curbing the Herzeg-Bosnian practice of "hitting the brakes" will 
start opening the door to foreign capital and touch off the 
magic suggestion by the U.S. Administration to emigre and other 
capital in the United States: Croatia is no longer a region of 
risk. Final peace and agreement on the status of the occupied 
territories will let Croatia into the world. Until then, there 
will be that small consolation in the form of the recent first 
installment of the $10-million U.S. loan to Croatia, which was 
really meant to stimulate U.S. cotton producers to sell their 
surplus to Croatia. 
  And there is a third, albeit not the least important matter. 
Where were the Croatian journalists in Atlanta? Was somebody 
from Croatian Radio and Television [HRT] there, but not invited 
to speak? Or was nobody there because they were not invited? 
Or were they invited, but did not accept? Only CNN and HRT 
know the answer. Only it has happened again that journalists 
sent into the world Serbian deceptions without a Croatian reply.

<F P=106> [Article by Jasminka Ivancic: "`Specialists'--Men for </F>
Hellish Missions"] 
  [Text] Fifteen days in the field, two days of leave, 
12 days of training. And this for two or three years. It is the 
specialist's duty to be at the state's disposal 24 hours a day, 
day in and day out. The specialist is a top-priority policeman, 
trained in skills that allow him to perform missions by the 
special police, but according to the strictly prescribed rules 
of the profession, says Mladen Markac. 
  We first met Mladen Markac in June 1992, in devastated 
Vocin, 
when many people would not even speak his name to us. We had 
come to that ravaged region while touring the local war zone and 
special units of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], which 
were working on clearing out the terrain. Besides Vocin, we 
visited a dozen other abandoned and ravaged towns in that 
region. The more we saw, the more our journalistic respect for 
the "specialist" men and their commander, police professional 
Markac, grew. 
  One of their lodgings was inside the sooty, crumbling walls 
of a hotel in Zvecevo, in rooms that reeked of the recent fire. 
That was one of the many areas where they were eliminating the 
consequences of war, chetnik barbarism, and reestablishing the 
safety of life. 
  "When we arrived, there was no life here. We cleared away 
barricades, mine fields; in the Papuk region we removed 1,930 
mines, there was no electricity, but we needed it, we 
reestablished electricity, then water; for communication with 
'civilization' we needed telephone service, and then after the 
inhabitants returned, they got mail service, like everything 
else," Markac summarizes part of his little-known mission, which 
has received little public attention over these four years. 
<H5>  Professionalism and Ethics </H5>
  Of course, it is much easier to talk about this "ordinary," 
accompanying work by the special police. The singularity of 
their wartime duties is in fact reflected by the case of Vocin, 
or rather the area of the former police administration of Osijek 
and Slavonski Brod, meaning the police stations of Podravska 
Slatina, Orahovica, and Pozega. The special police oversaw Papuk 
and part of Psunj. 
  The professionalism and ethics of these strong wartime 
nomads, who are obviously trained for the most difficult 
missions, was not overlooked by the inhabitants of the region in 
which they were active. For example, their doctors often saved 
the lives of civilians, offering them first aid and needed 
drugs. But little is known of this, and it is almost entirely 
unnoted in the annals of honor and glory; instead, their wartime 
successes remain in their memory and in the stories of those 
whom they encountered in the field. 
  Their wartime activities began with the first "massive 
disruptions of public order and peace by the rebel Serbs," with 
the first barricades, as increasingly extreme assaults turned 
into terrorism, and then into armed conflict, the brigadier 
general continues. They carried out missions in Glina, Petrinja, 
Dvor na Uni, and Karlovac, and after frequent attacks on 
Croatian police, military "skirmishes" began in the Pakrac 
region. During 1991, there were attacks on Kostajnica, Kozibrod, 
and Topusko across from Glina and Petrinja. 
  Plitvice was one of their first experiences with war. At the 
same time, the barracks of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's 
Army] were captured, which was very important since "there were 
no weapons and there was an embargo on importing them," Markac 
recalls. The weapons captured there were used not only to arm 
the police, but also to begin creating an army. 
<H5>  First to Oppose Terrorism </H5>
  The organization of additional special-purpose MUP units, 
known at the time as "strong forces of the MUP," began 
immediately after the fighting broke out, first with hidden 
enemies, and then with increasingly aggressive ones. At the 
beginning of the war, the police, as the only organized combat 
force defending the homeland, provided the first experts, 
commanders, know-how, arms, and equipment. In time, the National 
Guard Corps [ZNG] was formed, and then the professional 
brigades--or the Croatian Armed Forces [HV]--as well. 
  "The police were the first to oppose the forces of 
subversive 
disorder, attempting to establish Croatian authority in areas 
where there was rebellion. The internal police organization of 
units distinguished itself in complex war operations, but there 
was obviously also a need to create military formations. The 
dynamics of events in the field forced the police, and later the 
military as well, to seek out new tactical solutions more 
appropriate to the imposed manner of warfare," Markac says, 
explaining the sometimes incredible events of the war. 
  With the founding of the armed forces, the police reserves 
went over to the ZNG en masse, together with their equipment, 
and the police were again reduced to the ATJ [Antiterrorism 
Unit]. Terrorism spread throughout rear-echelon regions of 
Croatia. But the police quickly created new special units in the 
police administrations, with the average strength of one 
company. They were the best-armed and best-prepared units and 
became the spearhead of the Croatian defense forces, 
participating on equal footing with the HV in carrying out minor 
tactical missions as well as more complex military operations in 
crisis regions. 
  "We always acted professionally, effectively, and in 
accordance with international conventions. The secrecy of the 
work was to the specialists' disadvantage, so to speak, because 
people were not aware of the many missions that they 
successfully completed. But because of that the enemy became 
quite familiar with the effectiveness of our forces," Markac 
says. They established Croatian authority in the Velebit and 
Papuk regions, saw action in Pakrac and Dubrovnik, marched into 
Cavtat and Prevlaka, fought in Glina.... Where all were they not 
present!? 
<H5>  Field, Leave, Training </H5>
  But the police also had to do their own basic job, and the 
units changed their name to special units of the Croatian 
Police, so that the ATJ, because of the specific nature of its 
duties, remained as a unit on the state level, while the rest 
are in the regular structure linked to the police 
administrations and taking action in their region. Because of 
the extraordinary conditions under which they worked, the 
specialists' course of development went in the opposite 
direction--quickly thrown into war operations and combat, it was 
only later that they created a more refined structure and 
underwent training, but in that case with a certain amount of 
experience already under their belt. They had to adapt their 
manner of operation to domestic conditions, the imposed war. 
  "Fifteen days in the field, two days of leave, 12 days of 
training... and this for two to three years. It is inevitable 
that the regular rhythm of life is lost, but it is the 
specialist's duty to be at the state's disposal 24 hours a day, 
day in and day out. The specialist is a top-notch policeman, 
trained in skills that allow him to perform missions by the 
special police, but according to the strictly prescribed rules 
of the profession." 
  In short, this is only a suggestion of the working rhythm of 
members of the special units of the police, who over the past 
three years have created universal specialists, only for them to 
now specialize. What does that mean exactly? 
  "For three years, we did not train top-notch specialists for 
individual tasks; everyone did everything, but now we are 
working intensively on that very thing. In the beginning there 
were 2,200 policemen, recruited from the ranks of volunteers; 
250 were selected as the best, and they underwent an accelerated 
program. The one who distinguished himself as a leader in his 
group through his natural abilities, standing out physically, 
intellectually, and organizationally, became the commander," 
Markac says, explaining how the specialist is now schooled, for 
which four to five years are necessary. 
<H5>  Chooses This Job Himself </H5>
  Cooperative arrangements have been established with the 
School of Physical Culture and the School of Criminology, which 
train cadre, instructors for the police. After testing and 
selection upon acceptance into the police, the school determines 
whether the men selected also meet their strict 
criteria--whether their super quality makes them stand out. They 
then undergo further training, specializing as skin divers, 
mountain climbers, spelunkers, or pyrotechnicians, and resolving 
hostage situations is the top specialization but also the most 
dangerous situation. 
  ``The specialist has dual responsibilities in his job: 
professionally, because he must perform his duty, and morally 
because he has the legal authority, for example, to kill someone 
who is holding hostages. But no matter what kind of criminal it 
is that he shoots, even the most hardened one, that has an 
effect on the policeman. That is why it is extremely necessary 
to work on psychologically preparing each specialist, so that he 
can physically and mentally bear the burden of the most 
demanding tasks. 
  "Moreover, the specialist must choose this job himself, and 
from day one a feeling of belonging to a group must be developed 
in him, the sense that an action is being conducted by a group," 
says Markac, who judging from our conversation with him brings 
together knowledge, police and athletic experience, and 
psychological toughness and tenacity, which have helped him in 
his four years commanding the special police forces. 
<H5>  Deeds Make a Specialist </H5>
  In what other areas are specialists trained? As they say in 
their own jargon, it is extremely important that they master 
"the qualified application of force--that it be applied in the 
most humane manner, with the fewest possible consequences," 
aiming at targets selectively, because in a hostage situation, 
to use that example once again, "there is a small region of the 
body that you can hit" since the hostage is the one that covers 
and protects almost all of the abductor. But a master marksman 
will do his duty as it should be done. 
  They are not trained in diving for the purpose of 
recreation, 
but rather to pursue thieves of coral and other riches of the 
sea, for sunken ships and to rescue people and cargos, and so 
forth. The specialist does not scale peaks and crags for the 
sake of mountaineering success; he scales them under the load of 
equipment and the mission that he is carrying out--a military 
one now at Velebit, and in other situations capturing a fleeing 
criminal, across mountains buried beneath snow, lost in the 
mountains' traps.... 
  Finally, Markac emphasizes this: It is not uniforms, medals, 
or ranks that make a specialist, it is his deeds and 
effectiveness in performing his duties. But under wartime 
conditions, the special police has been unable to take advantage 
of anyone's experience; the experience gained along the way in 
our region has been "unique" and inestimable. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Mladen Markac, Policeman With Rank of Brigadier General </H5>
  Until recently the chief of the Special Police Sector, a 
former deputy minister of internal affairs, Mladen Markac is a 
policeman with the military rank of brigadier general. An 
athlete who completed studies in physical culture and a topnotch 
judo wrestler with international medals, he began working for 
the police in 1981. He started as an operative for general crime 
and later moved to preparing special-purpose units. And that is 
where the war found him. 
  During the war, he was awarded the military rank of 
brigadier 
general, and the only people outside the military to gain 
military ranks were members of the Antiterrorist Unit of the 
MUP, because they participated in all the most important 
military operations from the beginning of the war. After the 
Croatian armed forces were created, specialists and soldiers 
fought shoulder to shoulder, at the highest police-military 
level of cooperation. Indeed, the special police is almost 
autonomous in performing these tasks, as well as in logistics, 
with the exception of heavy weaponry, of which they have none. 
On the other hand, many HV officers acquired their first 
knowledge and experience in the police. 
  Markac says this, among other things, about the police: 
Terrorism was an extended arm of the war, and it was necessary 
to create a solid and strong police force. Moreover, under 
conditions of war, crime flares up as well. That can be 
countered only with a well-structured police force, to which all 
operative branches lend strength. The state has entrusted to the 
police duties set out by the Constitution and by law, Markac 
explains, but the state need not fear a strong police, because 
the police is only an adjunct of the civilian authorities. 
Moreover, the state controls the strength and power of the 
police through its mechanisms. 
  Indeed, the basic work of the special police is this: 
fighting saboteur-terrorist groups, preventing kidnappings and 
hijackings, freeing hostages, establishing public order and 
peace to a greater extent, preventing ecological catastrophes, 
accompanying and ensuring the undisturbed transport of special 
cargo, detaining persons whose activities are exceptionally 
dangerous, and so forth. Operation "Ring," better known as the 
resolution of the "Pintaric case," was a textbook example of a 
hostage situation, Markac said, and one that he commanded.

    [Editorial Report] The following items on problems 
pertaining to privatization in the Republic of Croatia are drawn 
from periodicals published in that republic. 
<H5>  Irregularities in Forest Enterprise Alleged </H5>
  A report on the Hrvatske Sume [Croatian Forests] public 
enterprise has been removed several times from the Croatian 
Assembly's daily agenda at the last moment, a fact that leads 
the Zagreb weekly DANAS to be suspicious about the business 
operations of the enterprise. In its 29 March issue discussing 
an unspecified Assembly debate on the enterprise, the weekly 
observes that: "What happened surprised many--Minister of 
Agriculture and Forestry Ivan Tarnaj tendered his resignation, 
while the prime minister dramatically came to his defense, 
refusing to accept the resignation. Although there were rumors 
that big shots were involved, the resolution of the situation in 
the enterprise was not completed. The government alloted two 
additional months for restructuring the management board of the 
Hrvatske Sume enterprise and investigating once more all the 
charges against this enterprise." 
  Reports on the investigations carried out by various 
Assembly 
commissions and state institutions, such as the Finance Police, 
cite several questionable areas in the business operations of 
the enterprise, according to DANAS. The Croatian Government 
admitted an operating loss of 576,000 German marks [DM], which 
was most often described by Assembly delegates as a "crime," 
DANAS states, adding that Vera Stanic, a member of the Assembly 
commission investigating the work of the Hrvatske Sume 
enterprise, enumerated specific irregularities, such as illegal 
foreign currency transactions, violation of a government 
decision limiting the production of certain wood products, and 
financial misconduct to the detriment of the enterprise and the 
state through misrepresentation of income, preferential 
treatment of private enterprises, and unauthorized felling, 
trade in, and export of wood. Stanic said that the enterprise's 
greatest problem is its management and demanded that Minister 
Tarnaj also be held accountable. Tarnaj defended the work of 
Hrvatske Sume, saying that the manner of privatization of the 
forestry sector was at the root of the controversy because "some 
individuals are trying to keep the best parts for themselves and 
leave those that are not good to the state." 
  In an interview published in the Split daily SLOBODNA 
DALMACIJA on 28 March, Stanic charged Hrvatske Sume's "top 
management" with the "theft" of Croatia's forests. "This is a 
real catastrophe," she said, "the impermissible devastation of 
the greatest of Croatian resources." Stanic named individuals in 
Hrvatske Sume's management who had been indicted by the Public 
Prosecutor's Office. She also discussed a report issued by the 
Finance Police on irregularities in Hrvatske Sume's operations, 
in particular the enterprise's exporting of wood at 
"incomprehensibly" low prices without the authorization of the 
Ministry of Trade. 
<H5>  Jailed Businessman Threatens To Tell `Truth' on Privatization </H5>
  Sinisa Caktas, a Split businessman who has attempted to buy 
"almost all the best Dalmatian enterprises" with millions of 
German marks of "mysterious" origin, is staging a hunger strike 
during pretrial confinement because he has not received replies 
to protest letters he had sent to Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, several ministers, and 
President of the Croatian Privatization Fund Ivan Penic, says 
the 8 April Zagreb weekly GLOBUS. 
  According to GLOBUS, Canic says that he will keep quiet 
until 
his trial and then reveal the "truth" about privatization in 
Croatia. The weekly reports that Caktas is in pretrial detention 
with his associates Ivo Cecuk and Feri Toth on suspicion of 
having "misused a position of authority and falsified official 
documents in the ownership transformation procedure of the Split 
Mljekara [Dairy] enterprise." Caktas, on the other hand, accuses 
the Croatian Privatization Fund of selling him the Mljekara 
enterprise but not permitting him to register it in his own 
name. He claims that he concluded a contract with the Croatian 
Privatization Fund for the purchase of 50 percent of Mljekara's 
shares and is seeking a refund of the 4.5 million German marks 
he says he paid the fund, plus "large" compensatory damages. 
GLOBUS notes that the conflict over the dairy enterprise has 
been going on since September 1993. 
<H5>  Shares of Fishing Company Transferred to Privatization Fund </H5>
  By a decision of the management board of the Croatian 
Privatization Fund [HFP], 46 percent of the shares of the 
Jadran-Ribolov fishing enterprise, in the amount of DM8,700,000, 
are being transferred to HFP ownership, reports the 11 April 
edition of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. The daily notes that the HFP 
decision, issued to Jadran-Ribolov the previous day, states that 
not a single one of this block of shares had attracted a buyer 
when they were offered to the public. According to the general 
director of Jadran-Ribolov, SLOBODNA DALMAJICA says, a founding 
meeting of the shareholders' society will be held within the 
next 10 days. "Small shareholders" hold a total of 43 percent of 
Jadran-Ribolov stock, and the Split Bank owns the remaining 11 
percent. 
<H5>  Emigres' Investments in Weapons Factory `Disappear' </H5>
  The 1 April issue of GLOBUS alleges that 400,000 Swiss 
francs 
invested by Croatian emigres in the "first Croatian weapons 
factory" have disappeared. The paper asks: "Was the founding of 
the TOVO shareholding company intended to be the beginning of 
the construction of the first Croatian weapons and military 
equipment factory, or was it just a trick to rob Croatian 
emigres of thousands of francs?" According to GLOBUS, brochures 
appeared in Switzerland in 1992 urging Croat emigres to become 
co-owners in TOVO of Zagreb, the first shareholding company "for 
the needs of Croats." Emigres who paid for shares of stock in 
the company have never seen their actual shares and have never 
received any dividends. All they have are receipts for their 
payments, says GLOBUS, adding that the TOVO enterprise does not 
exist, "at least not at the addresses and telephone numbers 
published in patriotic brochures." GLOBUS lists the names of 
TOVO's founders, identifying them as members of the Croatian 
Democratic Community [HDZ], the party of Franjo Tudjman. "The 
only success the enterprise has had," GLOBUS states, was the 
"publication of several issues of MAGNUM magazine," which listed 
Branimir Glavas, soldier and politician from Osijek, as a member 
of its editorial staff and several weapons specialists from the 
Croatian Army's General Staff as permanent assistants.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 8 (AFP) -- A senior UN official met 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic Sunday [8 May] and defended 
a controversial decision by UN envoy Yasushi Akashi to allow 
Bosnian Serb tanks to transit through a NATO exclusion zone 
around Sarajevo. Sergio de Mello, UN civil affairs coordinator 
for ex-Yugoslavia, told reporters after the meeting that the 
agreement on the tank movement reached by Akashi Tuesday [3 May] 
with Bosnian Serb leaders was made "in the context of a rather 
complex and long negotiation." 
  De Mello said he was "not in Sarajevo to admit mistakes," 
but 
declined to provide details of his discussions with Izetbegovic, 
who has demanded Akashi's dismissal over the issue. Since Akashi 
agreed to allow seven Serb tanks to pass through the 
NATO-enforced 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the 
Bosnian capital, five have transited to the Trnovo region south 
of the city, a sixth has been blocked by UN troops near the 
Serb-held suburb of Lukavica and a seventh has gone missing in 
Serb-held Grbavica, close to the city centre. 
  The Bosnian authorities, angered by Akashi's decision, have 
written to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asking him 
to sack Akashi, and have said they will refuse to cooperate with 
the envoy any longer. UN peacekeeping officials in Sarajevo 
were also dismayed at the decision. 
  De Mello said he would "certainly not" replace Akashi in 
subsequent dealings between the United Nations and the Bosnian 
authorities. Meanwhile, soldiers of the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) continued searching for the missing Serb T-34 tank, 
UNPROFOR said in a statement early Sunday. A UN source said on 
Saturday that the tank was probably hidden in a large building 
such as a barn or a warehouse in or near Grbavica. The 
concession for Serb tanks to pass through the Sarajevo exclusion 
zone was "not the only event that may have slowed down the peace 
process in recent times," De Mello said. 
  It was "perhaps not the most striking of the setbacks" 
suffered by the peace process, and mediators were hoping to 
resolve "other chronic problems," citing the situation in the 
eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, the northwestern Bihac region 
and "other hot-spots." His talks with Izetbegovic had covered 
the situation in Gorazde where there remained "some seemingly 
minor but in fact very important differences" to resolve, 
notably the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces, "especially the 
Serb militia," from the three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion 
zone. 
  Izetbegovic again insisted on full Serb compliance with NATO 
ultimatums and exclusion zones as a prior condition for agreeing 
to a country-wide ceasefire.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 6 (AFP) -- A Bosnian Serb tank 
disappeared from UN surveillance Friday [6 May] less than a 
kilometre (half a mile) from the centre of Sarajevo while 
travelling from the Serb stronghold of Pale to barracks at 
Lukavica, on the capital's outskirts, a UN military source said. 
The source said the tank disappeared close to Grbavica, a 
downtown suburb held by the Serbs, in the exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo in which the United Nations has banned heavy weapons.

<F P=106> [By Pascal Barollier] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, May 7 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] Saturday [7 May] again appeared out-manoeuvred by 
Bosnian Serbs after losing sight of a Serb tank on the slopes 
above Sarajevo, little more than a kilometre (mile) from the 
city centre. UN sources admitted late Friday that the tank, the 
last of seven to pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone as a 
concession by UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, had escaped the 
surveillance of UN military observers (UNMO) as it approached 
the Serb-held suburb of Lukavica. 
  The disappearance of the tank was "intolerable," UNPROFOR 
spokesman Eric Chaperon said at a morning briefing. Another UN 
military official, speaking unattributably, said: "This is 
farcical, to put it mildly." 
  The UNMOs lost track of the tank around 7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) 
three kilometres (two miles) south of the inner suburb of 
Grbavica, Chaperon said. The tank's escape was "a clear 
violation" of the February 9 ultimatum by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation ordering Serb heavy weapons to a distance of 
20 kilometres (12 miles) of the city centre. 
  "The exclusion zone is still in force and the tank 
represents 
a threat to the city," Chaperon said. The military official 
said the UNMOs had "seen the tank-transporter travelling empty 
in the return direction and deduced that the tank had been 
unloaded at Grbavica." "What is certain is that the tank did 
not go through the checkpoint at Grbavica and that it is 
therefore somewhere inside the city," the official said. 
  The ongoing fiasco over the Serb tanks was triggered by 
Akashi's concession to Serb leaders in Pale last Tuesday 
allowing them to transit through the exclusion zone under 
UNPROFOR escort. The deal has "embarrassed" UN officials here 
and exposed serious disarray in the UNPROFOR operation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Failures of communication between UNPROFOR 
headquarters in Zagreb and officials in Sarajevo led to 
conflicting statements by UN spokesmen as the Serbs exploited 
the situation by sending their tanks into the zone without prior 
notification. 
  Early Friday, as spokesmen in Sarajevo announced the 
scheduled transit of two more tanks, the last of those initially 
announced, Akashi in Zagreb said he was reversing his decision 
as he felt he had been "deceived by the Serbs." The Serb tanks 
proceeded anyway, without notification. One was blocked at 
Lukavica and the other, which left from Pale late Friday, 
escaped the attention of the UNMOs "somewhere near the bobsleigh 
slope" that overlooks the city, Chaperon said. He blamed "poor 
visibility" and said the UNMOs were slowed by the Serb escort 
that was following the tank. "This is a problem of 
communications relating to the UNMOs. It's the UN system taken 
to absurd lengths, since they don't report to UNPROFOR but 
directly to New York," a UN officier said on condition of 
anonymity. "In addition the UNMOs move in groups of two, they 
are a mixture of nationalities, and sometimes they don't 
understand each other." 
  Akashi's initiative has allowed Serb military commanders to 
expose serious communications problems between Sarajevo, Zagreb 
and now New York. It has angered the Bosnian Government, which 
considers the UN envoy has given a military advantage to the 
Serbs and is demanding Akashi's resignation. 
  It also prompted a rare public rebuke Friday from the U.S. 
State Department, which said the Japanese diplomat had erred 
and that Washington had made down "our very strong concerns" to 
the UN secretariat. 
  The Serbs now have four tanks within the NATO exclusion 
zone, 
two known to be at Hadzici and one at Osijek, in Sarajevo's 
outer suburbs, and a fourth near the city centre which, Chaperon 
said, "we cannot locate."

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina today received Sergio de Mello, head of the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] sector for civilian affairs. 
They discussed the situation in Gorazde, Sarajevo, and some 
other locations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in particular the 
respect for adopted UN documents and their implementation on the 
ground. 
  After the talks they briefly met with reporters. Here is a 
report by Arijana Barukcija: 
  [Begin Sergio de Mello recording, in English with 
superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have just ended 
a lengthy and detailed exchange of views with President 
Izetbegovic. These talks came after the meeting with Prime 
Minister Siljadzic in Vienna yesterday morning and the meeting 
with Karadzic in Pale last night. As we had planned, we 
discussed some very difficult and urgent matters. These 
obviously included the problem of the passage of tanks through 
the 20km exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the question of 
Gorazde, and some other seemingly small, but, in fact, very 
important difficulties, which need to be resolved. I even held 
talks with a representative of the Bosnian Serb forces about the 
withdrawal from the three km zone. (We also discussed) the 
problem of a possible, but very difficult return of refugees in 
conditions where heavy weapons are still present in the 20km 
zone around Gorazde, something that we still cannot confirm. 
[sentence as heard] 
  We also discussed the situation in Brcko. You know that we 
deployed a certain number of observers there yesterday and 
today. I informed President Izetbegovic about the agreement on 
this area, and also about the proposals by the Bosnian Serb army 
on a cease-fire in the Posavina corridor. We also discussed 
some other important issues, such as the freedom of movement 
within and out of Sarajevo as a result of the agreement signed 
at Sarajevo airport on 17 March, where he, himself, was present. 
These are the basic questions we discussed with President 
Izetbegovic yesterday and this morning. [end recording] 
  President Izetbegovic also commented on the talks. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Yes, we discussed exactly what 
Mr. de Mello said. As regards the mistakes made here in the 
Sarajevo exclusion zone, we adhere to our position. We demand 
that the UN control the behavior of the Serbs in the Sarajevo 
zone more effectively than has been the case so far. As regards 
Gorazde, of course, we insist on the removal of all armed 
individuals, whether they wear blue or green uniforms on the 
Serb side. They must be removed from the three km zone so that 
our people can return there. In that respect we still have had 
no reply. As I understood, Mr. de Mello is expecting an 
(answer) today. We will see what happens. We will, of course, 
continue to insist on this. This is the minimum level of 
justice that we expect in Gorazde. Our people have been 
squeezed into a very narrow, small area on the left bank of the 
River Drina. The Serb side will try to settle their population 
there. This has to be prevented by all means and to protect the 
parts where the Muslim population live in the Gorazde area. 
  It would be positive if the situation in Brcko were to calm 
down. We do not want any war, any fighting there. They have 
made contact with our local commanders in the area. General 
Hazim Sadic [2d Corps commander] informed us about this 
initiative. We said they should inform us here about the 
initiative and we will then give them a definite answer on what 
else could be done in the Brcko area. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Dj. Palcevic: "Brilliant Victory in Gorazde"] </F>
  [Text] Uzice -- An interview with Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, was published in the Labor Day 
edition of VESTI in Uzice. Asked by Vitomir Tomic, the news 
editor of VESTI, what the next steps of the Srpska republic or 
their enemies were, Karadzic answered: 
  "Our steps will include strengthening our positions and 
lines. We shall prepare ourselves for defense. As far as the 
steps of our enemies are concerned, they will start an offensive 
from a protected area, such as Tuzla or Bihac, or, for example, 
an attack against the Serbian corridor. We shall defend 
ourselves for a time, and then we shall openly threaten them 
with a counteroffensive, as was the case with Gorazde. If we 
start a counteroffensive, the international community will mourn 
the Muslims. They, on the other hand, will complain and ask the 
whole world to save them and create a state for them. The 
victory in Gorazde is a brilliant victory for our army and our 
people. Based on the Gorazde crisis, in which we showed our 
superiority, the world must conclude that quick steps toward 
peace have to be taken. It seems to me that the value of this 
victory lies in the fact that we succeeded in showing the world 
that the Muslims are not able to conquer new territories. If 
the United States gets involved, it will become one of the 
warring factions, just as it was in the Vietnam war. The world 
has to decide whether it is more important to help the Muslims 
or to establish peace." 
  As for the immediate and long-term aims of the Srpska 
republic, its leader Karadzic said that the immediate aims were 
to defend the borders and obtain recognition, and that the 
long-term aim was to become a part of Serbia. 
  "We do not want to establish a Serbian federation. We think 
that a future Serbian state has to be unitary. It should 
consist of districts and should never again enter such a 
federation as could put its existence at stake. The present 
leadership and this generation of the people in the republic of 
Srpska has absolutely no inclination toward autonomy. We want 
to be Serbia. It can happen that the republic of Srpska is 
independent for a time, but it will be in a federation with 
Serbia. This only because the international community cannot 
accept that Serbia, accused of aggression, has won a war in 
which it did not even participate. The international community 
does not want to accept "a greater Serbia," as they call it. If 
we are forced to live in a federation with Serbia looser than 
planned for a year or two, this will not change our long-term 
aim in any way.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 6 (AFP) -- Eleven French aid workers 
held by the Bosnian Serbs for a month are to go on trial next 
week accused of arms smuggling on behalf of the mainly Moslem 
Bosniam army, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said Friday 
[6 May]. Karadzic told a French official at the Bosnian Serb 
headquarters in Pale near Sarajevo the 11 would be tried 
together, according to a French source. (In Paris, the French 
foreign ministry confirmed the meeting with Karadzic and again 
called for the volunteer workers' release.) 
  The Serbs had earlier indicated only three of the men with 
the non-governmental organisation Premiere Urgence (First Aid) 
would face trial on Sunday while the other eight would be 
released. The 11 are being held near the Serb barracks at 
Lukavica, an important Serb military base just five kilometres 
(three miles) outside the Bosnian capital. French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe has said the aid workers are the victims of 
Serb "manipulation" and described the 11 as "hostages." Paris 
has sent foreign ministry secretary general Bertrand Dufourcq to 
Belgrade to demand the workers be released, as it believes the 
Serbian government could hold the key to their fate.

Alain Juppe Sunday termed an extension of the detention of 11 
French aid workers by Bosnian Serbs "unacceptable." [passage

Government held the authorities of the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro) responsible for the detentions on an equal 
footing with the Bosnian Serbs. Paris "continues to demand the 
immediate and unconditional release of all our compatriots," he 
said, adding that "that is the message that has been transmitted 
directly to the Serb authorities" by Bertrand Dufourcq, the 
permanent secretary of the Foreign Ministry, who was visiting 
Belgrade.

  [Text] Novi Sad, 7 May (TANJUG) -- We will accept no 
compromise on Brcko under any conditions and any pressures, 
because the corridor in that area "is the main artery in the 
blood system of the entire Serb nation," Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the republic of Srpska assembly, said in an 
interview for tomorrow's issue of DNEVNIK of Novi Sad. 
  "An attack by Muslim-Croat armed forces on the corridor in 
the Brcko area would be the end of all peace initiatives and war 
would break out with all ferocity and with unforeseeable 
consequences," Krajisnik said. He stressed that the conflict in 
the Brcko area could be effectively prevented by reaching a 
global peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and certainly not by 
proclaiming Brcko a safe area. 
  "For days, efforts have been made to make the whole of the 
world public believe the disgusting lies broadcast by West 
European and U.S. media that Brcko is allegedly a Muslim town, 
and that the Serb army is allegedly preparing an attack on 
Brcko. All this is aimed at proclaiming Brcko a safe area so 
that the Security Council can insist on the demilitarization of 
Brcko under the threat of violence," Krajisnik stressed. "We 
must warn the world public that Brcko is in Serbian hands 
because it has a Serb, and not a slim, majority. That is why 
the Serbian side will at no cost allow its units in the Brcko 
area to be disarmed because, by doing this, they would allow the 
noose prepared by Western strategists to be put around their 
neck. This would cut the corridor for both Krajinas [in western 
Bosnia and in Croatia], that is for the republic of Serb Krajina 
and the republic of Srpska, or more precisely, its western part 
-- the Banja Luka Krajina," the president of the republic of 
Srpska assembly stressed. 
  Krajisnik recalled that a session of the republic of Srpska 
assembly will be held in Brcko on 10 May, in order to "prove to 
the whole world that Brcko is a Serbian town and that it will 
remain Serb."

  [Text] Brcko, May 7 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the Bosnian 
Croat Army in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed on Saturday 
[7 May] that joint Moslem-Croat forces were preparing an attack 
on the Serb corridor in the north of this former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  "The Serb corridor through (the region of) Posavina must not 
exist and its capture is the only objective of Croats and 
Moslems," Djuro Matuzovic, Bosnian Croat force commander for the 
area of orasje in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, told the local 
Croatian radio. "If this is not resolved politically, we 
soldiers expect an order which we shall carry out," Matuzovic 
threatened. 
  Bosnian Moslems and Croats have lately been concentrating 
strong forces towards the Serb town of Brcko which is situated 
in the narrowest part of the corridor which links eastern and 
western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic. This was confirmed 
on Friday also by two members of the 108th Brigade of the 
Bosnian Croat Army, the so-called Croatian Defence Council HVO, 
which is deployed in the Posavina region. The two soldiers 
deserted and surrendered to Serb units with the explanation that 
they did not wish to take part in the upcoming attack on Serbs. 
  Serb military sources said in Brcko on Saturday that the 
Croat soldiers also gave a series of facts which prove that 
preparations for a Moslem-Croat offensive in the region of 
Posavina were proceeding unabated. According to these men, 
machinery and equipment have been massively mobilized from 
private enterpreneurs in order to step up the preparations for 
the offensive. 
  Bosnian Moslem Army Commander Rasim Delic also said on May 2 
that units under his command were preparing an offensive on 
Brcko in order to cut through the Serb corridor. The Serb side 
has reached agreement with representatives of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on the deployment of U.N. observers 
in the area of Brcko and offered a truce in that region which it 
said its forces would carry out unilaterally even if the Moslems 
refused to accept it. 
  Moslems on Friday called off talks between military 
commanders of Bosnian Moslem and Serb forces on a cease-fire on 
the Brcko front, which had been scheduled for Saturday.

  [Text] Belgrade, 6 May (TANJUG) -- The Muslim Government 
has cancelled the meeting between the commander of the 2d 
(Tuzla) Corps of the Muslim forces and the commander of the 
eastern Bosnian corps of the republic of Srpska army, scheduled 
for tomorrow -- the information service of the main headquarters 
of the republic of Srpska army announced this evening. 
According to a statement by the information service, Colonel 
Engelen, the chief of staff of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] command for the northeast, who mediated in the 
organization of the meeting, today sent the following letter to 
Major General Novica Simic, the commander of the eastern Bosnian 
corps of the republic of Srpska army: 
  ``1. Although General Hazim Sadic, commander of the 2d Corps 
of the Bosnian Army, wants to meet you as soon as possible, his 
government has ordered him to cancel his earlier acceptance of 
the meeting. This will be dealt with at the highest level. 
  "2. This is why we suggest that the meeting scheduled for 
1300 on 7 May be postponed until further notice." 
  The information service statement, also forwarded to TANJUG, 
says that "this latest refusal to negotiate on the part of the 
extremist Muslim leaders in Sarajevo clearly shows that they are 
in favor of the war option, that they want to procrastinate with 
the negotiations as long as possible, and that they will not 
give up on the planned and prepared offensive against the town 
of Brcko and Serbian Posavina." 
  As Gen. Simic told TANJUG today, the talks were to focus on 
a 
cease-fire on the Brcko battlefield, exchange of prisoners, the 
unhindered passage of civilians, and the establishment of the 
so-called hot line.

  [Text] Novi Sad, May 8 (TANJUG) -- Major-General Novica 
Simic, commander of the East Bosnia Corps of the Bosnian Serb 
army, has said that the Serb corridor must not be jeopardized, 
let alone cut, at the Serb town of Brcko because it is the 
lifeblood of the Srpska republic. Bosnian Moslems and Croats 
have been amassing strong forces towards Brcko these days. The 
town of Brcko is located in the narrowest section of the 
corridor which links eastern and western parts of the Srpska 
republic. 
  In an interview to the Novi Sad daily DNEVNIK on Sunday, 
Major-General Simic reiterated that "Brcko is a Serb town and if 
anyone should secure and defend it, it is the Bosnian Serb 
Army," adding that the scenario prepared for Sarajevo and 
Gorazde was not applicable to Brcko. "We hold Brcko, as well as 
the corridor, and there is no price for which we shall allow the 
corridor to fall into Moslem hands," the major-general was 
adamant. 
  It is evident that the Moslem leadership wants a repetition 
of the "Gorazde incident" so that the Moslem Army could break 
through to the River Sava unhindered and cut the corridor with 
the help of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Major-General 
Simic said. Brcko is not Gorazde, he warned, the Bosnian Serb 
Army is preparing to counter any possible attacks.

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 8 (AFP) -- Sixteen UN 
military observers have deployed in the northeastern Bosnian 
town of Brcko, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) announced 
Sunday [8 May], but Serbs forced another team in nearby Zvornik 
to leave. A spokesman for UNPROFOR's northeastern sector, 
Captain Jens Kirk, confirmed the deployment of 16 observers at 
four observation posts near the front lines of the Bosnian 
Serbs, who hold the town, in line with an agreement reached 
earlier this week with local Serb authorities. Their presence 
is aimed at averting fighting in a strategic corridor linking 
Serbia with territory held by the Bosnian Serbs in Croatia and 
northwestern Bosnia. 
  A UN official said the team in Zvornik, on the Drina River 
border with Serbia, had been forced to leave Saturday by Serb 
forces. Swedish General Gunnar Ridderstad, commander of 
UNPROFOR forces in northeastern Bosnia, told AFP the withdrawal 
threatened to disrupt observation of traffic through the town, a 
key entry point into the Brcko corridor. He confirmed that 
Bosnian Serb forces had been blocking the route from Tuzla to 
the Moslem enclave of Srbrenica, a UN "safe area", since April 
29. 
  "The situation is not desperate, as some convoys could still 
come through from Belgrade, but it is getting worse every day," 
he said. He said the blockade followed Danish retaliation 
against a Serb attack in which Danish tank gunners killed nine 
Serbs and wounded four. According to unconfirmed reports from 
both Serb and mainly Moslem Bosnian sources, the two sides have 
been sending reinforcements to the corridor ahead of an expected 
new, large-scale offensive.

<F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] The UN resolution and the NATO ultimatum represent 
only a dead letter on the paper and the flagrant deceit by the 
international community that the civilian population of the free 
territory of Gorazde will be protected. Nothing contained in 
the decisions adopted by the Security Council and NATO has been 
respected in the free territory of Gorazde. A real hell reigns 
here. Is indeed a pity that reputable world press and 
television agencies have not come here to film the suffering of 
the unarmed people. 
  The attempts by the citizens from local communities and the 
villages of Kopaci, Uvjeri, Vran Potok, Causevici, Kazlagici, 
Zubcici, Zuzevo, Milanovici, Brijez, Pticino Polje, and other 
areas in the 3 km zone to return to their houses have all been 
in vain. 
  The evacuation of the seriously wounded children has not 
been 
going according to plan either. We do not know whose mistake it 
was, but a three-year-old boy, Adnan Azovic, was not on the list 
of those evacuated to a modern hospital. He is seriously ill. 
Permission for his evacuation was obtained a year ago and yet 
he is still in Gorazde. His parents have medicines, [name 
indistinct] for only two more days. This medicine means life to 
him. If he is not evacuated, his childhood will end forever. 
Therefore, we again appeal to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and 
all international medical organizations to secure the evacuation 
of the seriously ill children from Gorazde.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 7 (AFP) -- UN aid officials are 
preparing to withdraw staff from Serb-held areas in Bosnia, 
including three Moslem enclaves, due to the threat of NATO air 
strikes, according to an internal memo seen by AFP Saturday [7 
May]. The UN refugees' office (UNHCR) memo, marked 
"confidential," warns that the threat of air strikes is "ever 
present," and says that such action could trigger Serb 
retaliation, including kidnapping of UN aid personnel. "We 
believe that until the present circumstances change, UNHCR 
should suspend operations in Bosnian Serb held areas and in the 
three eastern enclaves," it said, referring to Gorazde, 
Srebrenica and Zepa. 
  A UNHCR official here, asked about the memo, confirmed its 
existence and said the aid agency was "preparing" its withdrawal 
from the three enclaves and Serb-held territory "for the safety 
of staff on the ground." The official asked not to be named. 
  The memo, dated Geneva May 4, said: "There is believed to be 
an ever present possibility of NATO air strike on Bosnian Serb 
targets, moreover without advance warning or ultimatum." 
  "UNHCR staff in Bosnian Serb territory, whether stationed in 
offices or driving convoys, are therefore facing an ever present 
risk of retaliation either through direct targeting or by being 
taken hostage." 
  The memo, the authors of whom were not clear, says the 
recent 
standoff between the Serbs and North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization showed the limits of the UN Protection Force in 
defending aid staff. "This means that UNHCR would withdraw its 
staff from Banja Luka, Pale and the enclaves with the possible 
exception of Gorazde at least for the time being and that it 
would no longer run convoys through Bosnian Serb territory." 
  "This is a question of `force majeure,'" it concluded. 
  The UNHCR memo said aid convoys into the three enclaves 
could 
continue to be accompanied by UN Protection Force troops.

  [Text] The talks with the Croatian delegation on the 
implementation of the constitution of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are continuing in Vienna. Talks are being 
held on the borders, the number of cantons, the distribution of 
the ministries in the government, and the posts in the 
federation. The course of the talks has so far been marked by 
rapprochement in all spheres, but, considering that these are 
very sensitive issues, they will require longer and more patient 
talks. A more specific agreement on the distribution of 
ministries in the government and the posts in the federation is 
expected after the conclusion of the talks on the cantons.

  [Editorial Report] Under the title "We Would Join New 
Federation Only With the Republic of Srpska" the Belgrade daily 
BORBA publishes in its 6 April issue an interview with Fikret 
Abdic, leader of the self-proclaimed autonomous region of 
western Bosnia, conducted by reporter Nena Ivankovic. 
  Asked to give his opinion of the "`new marriage' of the 
Croats and Muslims in former Bosnia and Herzegovina" and whether 
the the autonomous region of western Bosnia would join that 
federation, Abdic states that "every effort leading to the 
ultimate objective, a lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
deserves praise. Thus, I praise the recent Washington agreement 
between the Muslims and the Croats, provided that it is not 
another Croat-Muslim coalition aimed against the Serbian 
people." When asked whether the autonomous region of western 
Bosnia would join the Muslim-Croat federation, Abdic responded: 
"We'll wait and see the Serbian reaction. If the republic of 
Srpska joins this federation, which I personally doubt, the 
autonomous region of western Bosnia would become part of that 
federation. However, I personally think that the European Union 
peace plan will be reactivated. Perhaps it will be modified a 
little, and adapted to the U.S.-Russian plan." 
  In response to Ivankovic's observation that it appears that 
the "great powers" are recommending the "restoration of some new 
Yugoslavia," Abdic states "we all must realize one thing: 
Economic reintegration of the former Yugoslavia must happen. It 
must, because it is in the interest of all the peoples, not just 
one. It appears to me that the sides are moving in that 
direction. To be sure, too much blood has been spilled. It will 
be hard to restore mutual trust, but I think it will be 
restored. The Serbian-Croatian agreement on the normalization of 
relations is the first link in the chain of a return to mutual 
trust. The restoration of a new Yugoslavia is, therefore, 
possible, but only in an economic form; politically, it 
certainly is not."

  [Text] [Announcer] For the first time since the beginning 
of the aggression against our country, a delegation of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran visited Sarajevo today. The 
delegation, headed by 'Ali Akbar Velayati, was received by 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, Alija 
Izetbegovic. Senada Cumurovic reports: 
  [Cumorovic] President Izetbegovic was the first to address 
the reporters after the talks, saying that the visit of the 
Iranian delegation would have taken place earlier if UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] had enabled it, and stressing that Iran 
was one of the first states to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We must point out that the 
course of our struggle for freedom would have been different and 
less successful without Iran and its aid. Iran has given us 
great support and aid, and it is continuing to do so today. You 
are aware that Iran has also offered its military aid, which was 
turned down by UNPROFOR. I am sorry to say that it was easier 
for them to witness the destruction of Gorazde and the murder of 
the people in Gorazde than the presence of Iranian soldiers. 
Why? Those who refused to accept several thousand Iranian 
soldiers in the ranks of UNPROFOR could explain this. We of 
course cannot understand this, as well as many other things. 
  Our representatives recently visited Teheran. As you know, 
our deputy premier was recently in Teheran as well as the 
Bosnian minister of defense, and they made certain deals there. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] The Iranian foreign minister also mentioned the 
lack of will by UNPROFOR to enable the visit of the Iranian 
delegation to Sarajevo. However, as this has taken place now, 
here are Mr. Velayati's impressions after the talks. 
  [Begin Velayati recording in English, with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] We admire the people and the 
government of Bosnia-Herzegovina for offering such resistance to 
the Serb aggression. The Islamic Republic of Iran is trying to 
help with humanitarian aid. Bilateral issues, the main areas of 
cooperation and the current situation regarding the resolution 
of the Bosnian issue were discussed during the talks. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] Minister Velayati said the Washington agreement 
between Bosnia and Croatia was positive. This is what Velayati 
said in connection with the activities of the Islamic Conference 
Organization [OIC]. 
  [Begin Velayati recording in English, with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] As an active member of the OIC's 
contact group we have resumed our efforts to organize the 
Islamic states. We are also insisting on our demand to send 
troops here. We are prepared to send 10,000 soldiers under the 
UN flag, but we have not received any logical and acceptable 
response from the United Nations. [end recording]

church in the nearby Croatian village of Drvetine near 
[Muslim-held] Bugojno was set on fire by Muslims last night. The 
church in the village, currently held by the Muslims, was burned

  [Text] Doboj, May 8 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems on Sunday 
renewed small arms and mortar attacks on Serb localities and 
positions in the north of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Bosnian Serb army said in a statement. The attacks were 
especially fierce around the town of Doboj -- situated in the 
corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian 
Serb republic -- which was the target of Moslem small arms and 
anti-aircraft guns fire, the statement added. 
  Bosnian Moslem and Croat military commanders have publicly 
nconfirmed they are preparing a joint offensive aimed at cutting 
the Serb corridor in northern Bosnia. Heavy Moslem attacks were 
also reported on Sunday on the front near Teslic. The Moslem 
attacks stopped when the Bosnian Serb army returned fire in 
order to defend the Serb settlements and the lives of Serb 
civilians in the area, the statement said. Strong Moslem small 
arms attacks were reported along the demarcation lines on the 
Ozren-Vozuce front, also in northern Bosnia. 
  The Moslems intensified their mortar, small arms and A-A 
guns 
provocations on the [words indistinct] in central Bosnia.

  [Text] The artillery attacks by the joint aggressor on the 
Bihac region continued last night and this morning. Karadzic's 
fascists sporadically shelled the outskirts of Bihac, and the 
lines of defense on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez, 
where they used anti-aircraft weapons and heavy machineguns. 
Several howitzer shells landed on [name indistinct] Jezero, and 
Gornji (?Srbljak). The chetniks were also active in the Buzim 
and (?Bosanska Krupa) region. Members of the Kladusa traitor 
paramilitary army have not been quiet either. Early this 
morning, they shelled the Trzac area, Svilaja, and Pecigrad in 
the Cazin commune, and Todorovo. They (?have not) tried 
infantry attacks.

  [Text] Geneva, May 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic said on Friday U.N. special envoy for 
former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi had confirmed his principled 
stand that only peace for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina could 
provide a sound foundation for a sensible and lasting political 
settlement. In a statement to TANJUG, Simic said Akashi had 
told him on the telephone he would continue to insist on 
neutrality in the Bosnian civil war and non-use of force in 
dealing with the problem. 
  Simic, who attended the sixth session of the working group 
for economic issues of the Geneva-based international conference 
on the former Yugoslavia, on Friday met with conference 
co-chairman Thorvald Stoltenberg, Akashi's closest aides, 
several influential international figures and representatives of 
international institutions. Among others he met with the 
director of the International Migration Service, with whom he 
had what he described as a cordial and constructive meeting 
which focused on a draft agreement on regulating the status of 
the organization's Belgrade office. 
  During the meeting, Simic spoke of the intention of some 
West 
European countries to launch a coordinated action of 
repatriation of Yugoslavs, mostly ethnic Albanians from the 
Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija. The Yugoslav official also 
met with Croatian ambassador in Geneva Miomir Zuzula, with whom 
he discussed normalization of bilateral relations. 
  Simic described the sixth session of the economic group as 
unsuccessful and dismissed as unfeasible a proposal put forth by 
chairman Jean Durrieu for reviving and reconstructing the 
economic space of former Yugoslavia. This goal is unattainable 
for as long as the civil war in Bosnia rages on and sanctions 
against Yugoslavia are in force, he explained. 
  Later on Friday, Simic is due to meet with the other 
co-chairman of the international conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, and the president of the World Health 
Organization. He may also meet with U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali before returning to Yugoslavia later tonight.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 7 KYODO -- Japanese International Trade 
and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Saturday [7 May] that 
Japan will send a trade expert to the former East Germany to 
help promote exports from the region. Meeting with his German 
counterpart Guenter Rexrodt, Hata said the expert from the 
semigovernmental Japan External Trade Organization will look 
into possible export products in the region for a year, a 
Japanese official said. Rexrodt told Hata that the former East 
Germany needs foreign assistance and he expects the Japanese 
trade expert to bring good results, the official said. 
  Touching on stalled Japan-U.S. talks on a new trade 
framework, Hata reiterated Japan's opposition to U.S. demands 
that Tokyo set numerical targets to measure progress in reducing 
Japan's trade surplus with the United States. 
  Rexrodt said there must be progress in opening Japan's 
markets, but noted that he opposes setting numerical targets as 
sought by the U.S. as Japan does. Hata and Rexrodt are in the 
Polish capital to attend the third meeting of economic officials 
from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and from 
officials from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union on 
East-West trade issues.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 7 KYODO -- A two-day East-West economic 
and trade conference was set to close Saturday [7 May] after 
adopting a statement summarizing its discussions on cooperation 
to promote the transition of the former Soviet Union and its 
East European allies to market economies. 
  Discussions in the final-day session centered on government 
policies to promote economic reforms in the region and measures 
to close regional economic gaps, conference sources said. The 
participants also exchanged views on a declaration, adopted by 
business executives at a business forum Friday, calling for 200 
billion dollars of direct foreign investment in the region by 
the year 2000, they said. 
  Present at the discussions on Saturday morning were 
ministers 
in charge of economic, industrial and trade affairs and business 
representatives from the Group of Seven (G-7) major 
industrialized nations and 10 countries of Eastern Europe and 
former Soviet republics, they said. The declaration also called 
for the privatization of state-run enterprises in the 10 
countries and promotion of East-West trade, they said. 
  Eijiro Hata, Japan's minister of international trade and 
industry, told a ministerial-level session in the afternoon that 
Japan will cooperate to promote industrial development in the 
region. In connection with this, Hata said Tokyo will hold 
seminars in Moscow and Warsaw in late September to help promote 
the development of smaller enterprises, foreign trade and 
investment. Hata also said Japan will conduct surveys in two 
former East-bloc countries, including Poland, in 1994 and 1995 
to work out measures to overcome the economic recession. 
  The United States is likely to be selected as the site for 
the next session in 1995, the sources said.

<F P=106> [Report by Jedrzej Bielecki: "Third East-West Conference -- </F>
Declaration of Business; Supporters and Opponents"] 
  [Text] "Today's meeting will go down in the history of 
international economic relations because never before has it 
been acknowledged so openly that it is, first of all, private 
companies that are responsible for the economic development of a 
given country and for the creation of new jobs, and that 
governments can only help in achieving this," said U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown at the end of the Third East-West 
Conference of the Ministers of Economy, Industry, and Trade of 
the G-7 and E-10 states. 
  "The Warsaw Declaration of East-West Business," approved at 
the conference by private entrepreneurs of the G-7 and E-10 
states, lists the conditions for quick economic development in 
the former socialist countries and their integration into the 
global economy. The document draws attention, among other 
aspects, to the need to persuade people in those states which 
are implementing reforms to acknowledge the role of foreign 
investments, which, because of the lack of the countries' own 
capital, are often the only possibility for transferring 
technologies and maintaining the competitiveness of companies. 
  Businessmen believe that liberalizing the rules of capital 
traffic might considerably accelerate the integration of the 
countries of this region into the global economy. According to 
them, international financial establishments should pay greater 
attention to the special needs of private companies and should 
more frequently employ venture capital [two preceding words in 
English] methods. The businessmen also stated that despite 
differences which exist right now, the countries of Central-East 
Europe should strive to make trade rules more uniform, which is 
particularly important now -- in a situation when regional 
economic alliances are being established all over the world. 
  One of the enthusiasts of the declaration is R. Brown, who 
said that it is the best road to the integration of Central-East 
Europe with the rest of the world. A similar view was also 
expressed by Aleksandr Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister 
and economy minister, who, however, expressed his disappointment 
over the approach of the G-7 group toward his country to date. 
Up to now the richest countries of the world have invested $2.6 
billion in the Russian Federation, whereas, according to A. 
Shokhin, this country is able to "absorb" $50 billion to $70 
billion a year. The Russian deputy prime minister pointed out 
that every year Russia loses $3 billion because of barriers to 
Russian exports imposed by well- developed states. According to 
him, the lack of orders for Russian military equipment is 
special proof of this. 
  Many reservations to the ideas contained in the declaration 
were voiced by Czech Economy and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, 
for whom the differences among the E-10 states are too great, 
and so it is not possible to carry out a joint economic policy 
toward them. He also warned against admitting foreign investors 
indiscriminately: they frequently take advantage of what is best 
in a given country, but do not give anything in return. Also 
Jean-Pierre Landau, chairman of the French delegation, drew 
attention to the fact that one cannot indiscriminately accept 
the remarks included in the declaration because governments have 
priorities different from those of economic milieus. 
  The greatest doubts concerning the possibilities of reaching 
the goals of the Warsaw Declaration were expressed by the 
representatives of the former Soviet republics, for whom almost 
the only possibility of attracting foreign capital is the offer 
of privatizing the economy. Uladzimir V. Radkevich, Belarusian 
foreign economic relations minister, said bluntly that since 
last year's East-West Conference in Tokyo, his government had 
looked more optimistically on possibilities for cooperating with 
the West and made a strategic decision concerning the 
integration of the Belarusian economy with Russia. Out of the 
offers of participation in 10 pilotage projects presented in 
Tokyo, not even one was answered. The next meeting -- the 
Fourth Conference of G-7 and E-10 countries -- will be held next 
year in Washington. Aside from the participants which have been 
taking part in the conferences to date, Slovenia will also 
participate -- as an observer. 
  During the conference, Warsaw was visited by Trevor Manuel, 
newly appointed trade minister of the Republic of South Africa. 
He was assured by the G-7 states that the future economic 
development of the Republic of South Africa would be supported 
by them. The United States decided to allocate $600 million for 
that purpose; Great Britain -- 150 pounds; Japan and Germany -- 
"substantial sums of money."

"Self- Portrait of Party Programs 2."] 
  [Text] To make our readers' job easier in making a 
decision, our editorial staff has put a set of question to the 
parties that were able to set up national lists. Our questions: 
  1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or 
welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four 
years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to 
even at the cost of other problems? 
  2. What are the three larger-than-average economic, 
political, social, or moral burdens facing the society or some 
strata of the society in the next four years, burdens connected 
with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not 
accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the 
background compared with other similar problems? 
<H5>  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] </H5>
  1. Out of the next four years' most important welfare 
measures, developing the state support for child rearing has a 
major importance. To a large extent, even now, it is the task 
of family help centers to support the families. The development 
of this network is justified. In addition to this, the 
financial transfers in society -- the tax system, social 
security, and welfare benefits -- have to be formed in such a 
way as to make it clear for everyone that society does not only 
emphasize the importance of families in words. The tax system 
will also have to be changed: During the four years of 
government, it has to be achieved that only the freely 
disposable income is taxed. For single parents, a fair 
possibility has to be guaranteed to reduce their tax basis. We 
wish to develop the tax system in a direction that will take the 
number of dependents into consideration. We have to develop 
further the institute of full-time maternity. 
  In the area of the economy, one of our main goals is to 
establish a financial and tax environment that fosters economic 
growth. Of the main tools of market stimulation, we think it 
necessary to change some important elements of the tax and duty 
systems in the interest of a more proportionate sharing of taxes 
and economic development. It is also necessary to reexamine the 
product structure of the general trade tax to improve the 
situation of the poorer groups in society. Parallel with the 
beginning of economic growth, we consider reducing the upper tax 
limit to stimulate the demand and to protect the domestic 
producers' interests to be justified. We suggest the abolition 
of the minimum tax. We only accept the temporary maintenance of 
the source tax if the budget uses it for development and 
investment purposes. 
  Economic development is impossible without cultural 
development. The KDNP wishes to implement a pluralistic cultural 
policy, we wish to support programs, rather than institutions. 
Our goal is to establish the dual system of support for culture 
that exists in Western Europe: a state and economic sponsorship 
structure. 
  2. According to the KDNP's economic policy, our task is to 
make increased incomes possible while maintaining the balance 
(without significantly increasing inflation, the budget deficit, 
or the balance of payments deficit) that: 
  -- on the supply side, stimulates investments by enterprises 
directly from their own incomes and indirectly through using the 
population's savings; 
  -- on the demand side, creates an effective demand that does 
not induce inflationary pressure or increased imports of 
consumer goods. 
  Due to balance problems, this increased income can only be 
implemented: 
  -- if we accept a temporary deficit of the budget and 
payment 
balance, 
  -- and if we use a very carefully designed, selective, and 
targeted tax system, budget reform, and credit policy. 
  If our program is implemented, the increase of consumer 
prices cannot exceed 14 to 16 percent. 
  However, in the interest of market stimulation, we cannot 
make it our goal to reach one-digit inflation in such a short 
time. In accordance with this, and in the interest of social 
peace, in the medium term, we can only expect that the budget 
deficit in proportion to the gross domestic product [GDP] will 
not decrease, or only to a very small extent. 
<H5>  Liberal Civic Alliance Entrepreneurs' Party </H5>
  1. For three years, since we accepted the program called 
"Bourgeois Transformation," our party's goals have not changed: 
competitive market economy, socially solidary society, and two- 
chamber parliament. We want to replace the state-centered 
economic policy with a "streamlined" economic policy. Economic 
stabilization is impossible without capital investment, which in 
turn needs a predictable economic environment and lasting laws. 
The reform of state finances cannot be delayed any further, tax 
payers can only finance the truly necessary tasks rather than 
budget labels without any function. Instead of self-interested 
and bureaucratic state privatization, we give preference to a 
privatization strategy based on public consensus with the 
involvement of the interest representations bodies. It is 
impossible to protect the domestic industry and trade without 
suppressing the black economy. We must guarantee price security 
for the agricultural producers through changing the subsidy and 
taxation systems. 
  The state, the local governments, the employers, and the 
employees have to make a new social pact. Out of the ways of 
handling unemployment in accordance with the local 
circumstances, investments from privatization revenue, tax 
allowances given to enterprises launched in crisis regions, and 
leaving the greater part of personal income tax with the local 
governments are important measures. We can handle the regional 
differences of unemployment through small-area crisis management 
programs. It is enterprises that can mostly create new 
workplaces. 
  We need a new constitution and a two-chamber parliament. 
Politics that unites and balances the interests is the only 
viable way for the future, for modernization. 
  2. We do not wish to spend too much energy on debtor, 
credit, and bank consolidation because this method will not 
reach the desired results without creating certain guarantees. 
The primary task to be solved would be bank privatization. 
Naturally, to achieve this, stabilization is necessary, even 
through the method of bank consolidation, however, if this is 
not concomitant with privatization then the capital pumped into 
the banks has to be seen as money down the drain. 
  Unemployment is a burning and tense problem. At the same 
time, the huge body of unemployed can be divided into two, well- 
distinguishable groups. One consists of truly unemployed people 
while the other group abuses the possibilities provided by the 
legal system and is possibly an active participant in the black 
economy. We only wish to deal with the latter group when we make 
it impossible for them to remain on benefits because their equal 
treatment with the truly unemployed people evokes serious moral 
aversions, and our shaky economy cannot support the burdens, 
either. We do not wish to deal with the issue of further 
compensations in the future, we respect the already existing 
compensations but do not support new ones. 
<H5>  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] </H5>
  1-2. Politics is an art of compromises. Rather than the 
politicians and political parties having to make compromises 
with each other, this means that balance has to be found and 
maintained between society's needs and values. Only the extreme 
and radical parties would annihilate or suppress all other 
values or interests for the sake of one particular value or 
interest. In the past four years, the government led by the MDF 
has shown that it is possible to maintain stability, namely to 
establish a balance extending to the whole society between the 
interests and goals, even under extremely difficult 
circumstances. We did not implement the shock therapy that had 
been recommended by other parties and some experts, however, we 
did not continue the peaceful inaction and dilapidation that had 
characterized the previous regime. We can promise this balanced 
policy for the next four years, too. We act, but with 
moderation, without endangering people's lives and material 
security with experimentations and short-term solutions. 
  The most important values and the price to be paid for them: 
  -- The preservation of social security in the growth period, 
too. The framework of the social market economy has been 
established, the economy has entered a growth period. In 
legislation and in the state's activities we have to concentrate 
on patching up the welfare net, we have to achieve that none of 
the needy people are left without any support. We would mainly 
like to improve the situation of pensioners and young people; 
the latter group is especially important because the burdens of 
setting up a family and rearing children also rest on the 
younger generations. 
  It is possible that the probably very fast growth will not 
reach its maximum speed because of the resources spent on social 
security, but we are convinced that, this way, the growth will 
have a better foundation and this is profitable in the long run. 
  -- The state has to promote economic growth. Economic growth 
is vitally important for the country, because living standards 
have not improved in the last 15 years. An improvement can only 
be achieved through growth. 
  According to the experience of economic history, growth is 
always concomitant with minor budget imbalances, the same way as 
an enterprises is also forced to take on loans if it wants to 
invest and expand. However, enterprises that are worried about 
taking on loans and therefore do not develop, will certainly go 
bankrupt, because the old saying about capitalism that states 
that you have to run to stand still is true. (In other words, 
one has to develop even just to maintain the current situation, 
because the competitors are also developing). 
  We have to make our contacts with Western Europe tighter in 
all areas. There is only one solution to our economic 
development and security situation: To return to Europe. To 
join the European Union [EU] and NATO. Many things might still 
happen to the east and south of us. It matters a lot what kind 
of government a country has at the time of a possible radical 
change and whether it has international security and economic 
defenses. Neutrality would expose the country to a possible 
radical nationalist or communist danger. 
  Returning to Europe also requires sacrifices. We cannot 
conduct a protectionist policy, we cannot introduce customs 
duties as we wish, because, if we did, our Western partners 
would do the same to keep out Hungarian goods. We succeeded in 
that Hungary will open its markets to the European Union later 
than the European Union to Hungary. 
<H5>  Hungarian Socialist Party </H5>
  1. The most important task is to achieve that society's best 
forces cooperate with each other in the interest of solving the 
country's problems and reducing the divisions in society. A new 
social agreement has to be established between the employers, 
the trade unions, the interest representation bodies of 
employees, the civic organizations, and the government that will 
guarantee peace in the country. The decision-making system has 
to be changed in such a way as to make it possible to learn 
about a broad range of views and to create a consensus. 
  The decline of the economy has to be stopped, the 
deterioration of the balance and the increase of indebtedness 
have to be curbed, the development of the Hungarian economy has 
to be put on a modernization course that will establish the 
conditions for lasting economic growth. In the interest of 
this, we have to implement the reform of the state finances, we 
have to complete bank consolidation, and we have to put 
agriculture back on its feet. The state has to take an 
organizing role in recapturing the eastern markets and in 
developing the infrastructure. 
  In the interest of the economy's sound development, 
privatization has to be placed on a new footing in which 
longer-term economic considerations, and leaders and employees 
interested in the future of the enterprise, would receive a more 
prominent role instead of the current bureaucratic control. 
  In the interest of ensuring the country's external peace, we 
consider a balanced foreign policy necessary. In addition to 
getting closer to the European Union, we strive for balanced and 
good relations with all our neighbors, and for strengthening 
these relations. Our solidarity for the Hungarians living 
beyond the borders is part of our solidarity for the Hungarian 
nation and, at the same time, it is part of a future European 
system of protecting national minorities. 
  2. In the next four years, although we will do everything 
sensible we can to achieve them, we can already now see that we 
will only be able to achieve partial results on some points of 
our program. 
  -- Unemployment cannot be ended because we are still to face 
the problems related to the structural change, however, there is 
a realistic chance to reduce it. 
  -- The burdens of debt servicing will not be reduced because 
another peak of debts was created in the past four years, 
however, if we manage to improve our economy's ability to 
compete and its export performance, then the burdens will be 
better shared through the bigger turnover. 
  -- Inflation cannot be reduced to a single-digit figure due 
to the delay in the reform of state administration and the again 
wide agrarian price gap, but inflationary pressures can be 
avoided and inflation can be pushed down to around 15 percent. 
<H5>  Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP] </H5>
  Welfare care should provide a safe point for everyone who 
happens to be swept too far from the will of society through no 
fault of their own. The support and welfare system should be 
based on needs and the task is to draw this up and to implement 
it. In other words, the various provisions have to be separated 
(a hospital is not an old people's home), the support has to be 
targeted to the individual (rather than the family or the school 
or institution, it should be the person in need who receives the 
support and the right to dispose of it), the goal should be 
prevention and preparation for adjustment, and welfare care 
should be made part of the small communities. 
  To change the social system, the current centralized and 
redistributive system of collecting the social revenue has to be 
broken down again. Changing the system of state finances is the 
first step. In the framework of this, we can implement the 
following: Lessening the centralization of tax revenue and its 
spending, separating the state finances from the budget, placing 
the government and the state-owned organizations under the rules 
of the private sphere -- rather than the state's power -- thus 
separating and requalifying them from the "tool of executive 
power" to the rank of participants on the market. We also have 
to thoroughly simplify the production and the collection system 
of incomes from taxes, duties, and of fiscal sources. 
  In the course of reconstructing our society and the economy, 
the guiding principle is our linking to the European practice on 
an equal basis, in which the major task is to establish the 
institutional, group, and personal requirements of cooperation. 
  The basic conflict lies between modernization and its 
rejection (conservation, return to the feudal estate), and this 
creates counter-movements that are even noticeable on a 
political level (yearning for the past, and so on). 
  The structural change and the ensuing work mobility are not 
two different sides of the challenge of modernization, rather, 
they are the same phenomenon, and they only appear to be 
separate from the work's and the employee's point of view. In 
our position, it is obvious that the tasks we undertake should 
be adjusted to the market requirements rather than to our old 
abilities. However, this is only a matter of priorities rather 
than of bearing the burdens. [sentence as published] 
  2. In the interest of what has been said above, and in 
accordance with our priority system, we do not support, for 
example, the actions that are being conducted now and for whose 
maintenance there is much pressure. One such area is financing 
the deficit -- which resulted from the unsuitability and 
inability shown in solving the problem of international 
cooperation and foreign markets -- through convertible (or 
domestic) debts. Another is the budget support -- 
"consolidation" -- of losses and indebtedness of banks and large 
enterprises that resulted from unprofessional (state) management 
and private control. Finally, another such area is the 
diversion of tensions arising from the unresolved nature of 
social and interest coordination problems, state spending, and 
the unchanged distribution system to a political level. 
  This is the subject and goal of a possible social contract, 
rather than the polishing of the representative and declaration 
system and statutes of various "forums." [sentence as 
published] Because this only creates the possibility for 
covering up the lack of social peace, rather than creating the 
road for social peace. 
  We do not accept the moral burden of the repetitious 
mentioning of outdated ideas in politics, the promising of false 
stability in the economy, the beautifying "powdering" in the 
social situation, the cherishing of illusions (third road, 
separatist showing of being Hungarian, or rejection of world 
standards) and, all in all, provincialism and its twin sister, 
populism, with its superficiality, aggressiveness, and shunning 
of responsibility and tasks. The MSZDP will undertake to 
establish solidarity, justice, and equality of opportunity.

<F P=106> [Third in a series of three unattributed articles: "The </F>
Image of Party Programs 3."] 
  [Text] To make our readers' job easier in making a 
decision, our editorial staff has put a set of questions to the 
parties that were able to set up national lists. Our questions: 
  1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or 
welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four 
years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to 
even at the cost of other problems? 
  2. What are the three larger-than-average economic, 
political, social, or moral burdens facing society or some 
strata of society in the next four years, burdens connected with 
or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not 
accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the 
background compared with other similar problems? 
<H5>  National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] </H5>
  1-2. The NDSZ's economic policy is based on a fundamentally 
different assessment of the situation, economic philosophy, and 
value system than that of the liberal (or in other words, 
neo-conservative) economists and the parties influenced by them. 
Therefore, its questions and answers are also different from the 
currently widespread liberal logic. In our view, rather than 
the fact that we previously had a socialist system in Hungary, 
the basic problem is that the driving forces of extensive growth 
that uses an increasing amount of raw materials and energy have 
been exhausted in the developed countries (both in the West and 
the East), and from a consumer society, the (developed part of 
the) world is entering a sustaining society that also takes the 
requirements of environmental protection into consideration. 
This transition goes with major economic commotions, and the 
withdrawal of resources from the developing and former socialist 
countries (including Hungary) through international credit links 
is part of this process. Therefore, for Hungary and for other 
former socialist countries, the establishment of some kind of a 
capitalist system similar to 18th century England cannot bring a 
solution. Instead, we have to find the economic mechanism and 
social structure that correspond to our national circumstances 
and traditions, and which meet the requirements of the 21st 
century. As part of this, the NDSZ: 
  a. Wishes to break with the liberal politics that exposes 
Hungary's markets to the significantly more developed 
multinational companies, and it offers a policy of selective 
market protection against it; 
  b. It also wishes to break with the liberal principle that 
wishes to counteract the inflationary pressure of free prices 
with high interest rates. Instead, the NDSZ advocates a tight 
price control of basic consumer goods and raw materials, to 
reduce inflation this way; 
  c. The above two changes make it possible to reduce the 
interest rates, and to replace the restrictive financial policy 
typical of the past few years with a policy of economic 
stimulation. 
  2. Through its above economic policy, the NDSZ mainly wishes 
to alleviate the burdens affecting the broad masses of people 
and to improve their position. In the interest of this, it pays 
less attention to satisfying the needs of rich people. For us, 
it is more important that the average citizen be able to receive 
affordable and satisfactory quality goods, say, within a Central 
and East European cooperation, than to have all products of the 
world for sale (for those, of course, who have the money for 
them). For us, the just distribution of the national assets is 
more important than the increase of the proportion of private 
property at all costs. We do not believe the tale that can only 
imagine a country's economic prosperity on the basis of selfish 
private interests, accompanied by corruption. We do not believe 
that private assets are more efficient than anything else; for 
us, all forms of property are equal in rank. We do not believe 
that, for the country's economic prosperity, we first have to 
establish an immensely rich private owner social strata, and we 
accept all the tensions arising from the fact that our views are 
contrary to the now popular liberal, or in other words, 
neo-conservative, views. 
<H5>  Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] </H5>
  1. The reduction of people's burdens and, at the same time, 
reducing the parasite elite to obedience; 
  -- the establishment of equality of opportunity applying to 
the whole life; 
  -- climbing out of the debt trap. 
  2. We pay less attention to those unemployed people who do 
not wish to work; however, we do all we can for those who do 
want to work; 
  -- we do not cry for the III/III department members 
dismissed 
from the Radio; 
  -- we are indifferent to the fate of the workers' militia 
and 
leather jackets [members of plainclothes police in the 1950's]. 
<H5>  Green Party of Hungary </H5>
  1-2. The most important political tasks: 
  The suppression of the extreme liberal political trends in 
Hungary in the interest of preventing the further proliferation 
of fascist and racist strife. Deceiving the domestic ethnic and 
national minorities with their political manifestations and 
hypocrisy, and with the help of their instigator organizations 
and provocations, they try to implant in them the feeling of 
defenselessness, being persecuted, and being in a 
disadvantageous position. 
  Due to being organized on a racial basis, they already now 
create antagonistic feelings in citizens, which will continue to 
increase in the future because of their unlimited greed for 
power, and this can lead to conflicts. As they have control 
over some of the media, we have to conduct enlightening 
propaganda to prevent their deception. 
  We strive for a neutral position, and want to withdraw the 
request for NATO membership. We had enough of foreign 
dependence. After the Soviet Union, the military forces of 
Western Europe would occupy our country. We would be a 
deployment area, and a buffer zone between the West and the 
East. We would again be the losers. Together with Switzerland 
and Austria, we could very well exist as a third small neutral 
country. Whatever conflicts we might have, NATO would not 
defend us anyway, it is not in its interest, because we do not 
have oil wells like Kuwait which was a U.S. interest. NATO has 
many times shown its "inability" to act in the case of conflicts 
outside its sphere of interest. Instead, we should strive for 
good-neighborly relations with the neighboring countries, and 
with Russia mainly, we should establish total conciliation and 
cooperation because it will soon have a determining role in 
Europe. 
<H5>  Workers' Party </H5>
  1. A correct analysis of the situation is a decisive 
condition of socially acceptable politics and of good 
governmental economic policy. In addition to the inherited 
difficulties and the world economic situation, the economic 
policy of the past four years was the decisive factor in the 
deterioration of the economic situation. The forced 
establishment of the economic and social bases of capitalist 
transformation did not result in an increased economic 
productivity. Today, the Hungarian economy is in a worse 
situation than in 1989-1990. All this has serious social 
consequences: 1 million unemployed people, the deteriorating 
status of whole social groups, and mass impoverishment. 
  The political institutions do not reflect society's real 
interest conditions. Today, a sicker economy and sharper 
conflicts are the main characteristics of the crisis. 
  According to the Workers' Party, two remedies will have to 
be 
applied together. On one hand, we need a new economic policy. 
On the other, through important political changes, we have to 
release the economy from the confines of the forced politics of 
the change of the regime. 
  The country's situation can be significantly improved in 
four 
to five years. Our economic policy is based on three pillars. 
  Instead of the current restrictive politics, we want 
development, more investments, higher consumption, lower 
interest rates, smaller and predictable taxes, and more 
workplaces. Secondly, we want an economic environment that is 
based on the equality of opportunity of the various forms of 
ownership. Thirdly, the state has to take on an active role in 
the economy, in ownership, in defining the main proportions, and 
in financing some strategic areas. 
  We believe that the points of breakthrough in the next 
period 
can be created by establishing some leading branches in the 
economy. We want to develop the construction industry through a 
large-scale program to build 70-80,000 flats. With a more 
favorable economic policy, the light industries would be 
suitable for creating many new workplaces. In our view, the 
development of telecommunications and road building are 
important leading branches of industry. We need a state concept 
to lay the basis of some industries' future development, for 
example food industry and engineering. 
  The area of human investments is another explicitly 
important 
area from the economic and social points of view. Financing 
education means financing the future. It is impermissible to 
exclude whole social strata from acquiring modern education. 
With a disheveled health system, Hungarian people will not just 
have less knowledge to enter the 21st century than their 
colleagues in Western Europe, they will also have a worse state 
of health and less stamina. Therefore, in our view, it is 
essential to ensure free medical provision as a basic right of 
citizens. Among the welfare measures, we consider it important 
to keep the current age limits of retirement, and that 
guarantees should protect the value of pensions against 
inflation. It is very important from an economic and political 
point of view for the new parliament to change the law on 
housing. 
  The Workers' Party believes that only a policy adjusted to 
the needs, or at least to the tolerance level, of the workers 
who make up the majority of society is able to fight the serious 
and contradictory factors of the crisis. We cannot demand 
society's various segments to confront each other. 
  With an active use of the current points of breakthrough, 
unemployment can be reduced to below 5 percent in five to six 
years' time, and inflation below 10 percent. We cannot continue 
the forced consolidation of the capitalist conditions and the 
governmental policy to expand it. Therefore, in the view of the 
Workers' Party, it is harmful to force privatization at all 
costs, without a concept of ownership. The current 
privatization has to be stopped. It is more important to 
operate the existing mixed economy efficiently. Any kind of 
privatization should only be done with social control and the 
workers' participation. 
  In our view, it is a basic requirement to end the policy 
against agriculture and the cooperatives. Security has to be 
established in land ownership, production, and selling. 
Compensation has to be ended. It is impossible to build 
economic solutions on the basis of moral categories. 
  It is important to rid ourselves of our illusions as regards 
Western Europe. Social security can only be based on an 
economic development that leads to a breakthrough. Naturally, 
to achieve this, we need resources. In addition to creating a 
supportive tax and credit system, we must significantly reduce 
the state expenditure and stop bureaucratic overspending. At 
the same time, we have to agree with the West that if it does 
not want the Hungarian economy to collapse and a domestic 
political explosion to ensue then they should cancel some of our 
$24 billion debts or the repayment of the interest. 
  In the view of the Workers' Party, overcoming the crisis 
requires fundamental political changes. We support a social 
agreement or pact. However, this cannot be restricted to the 
negotiations of the employee organizations, employers, and 
government. A feasible social pact can only be based on a 
parliament that expresses society's multifold interests and 
asserts them through the laws. 
<H5>  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] </H5>
  1. The SZDSZ emphasizes three main tasks of economic and 
social policy. The first one is establishing the conditions for 
economic growth. Economic growth is not a matter of decision -- 
when the necessary conditions were missing, forced growth 
created difficult situations on many occasions -- it requires 
the establishment of various defined conditions. 
  The new government has to establish an atmosphere of 
stability and predictability by forming the conditions for 
clear-cut economic conditions. The increase of the budget 
deficit can be stopped and inflation can be curbed through a 
cheap state, namely by ruthlessly reducing public expenditure. 
An overall social agreement can protect employers from 
unpredictable wage demands and employees and pensioners from 
their income losing value. Reduced taxes and allowances on 
company tax and wage costs can stimulate the enterprises and the 
establishment of new workplaces. The stabilization of the bank 
system and the establishment of new money market institutions 
can improve the entrepreneurs' conditions to have access to more 
capital. The acceleration of privatization contributes to an 
early consolidation of the decaying large enterprises. A fast 
settlement of the land ownership will create stable conditions 
for farming and agriculture. 
  Continuing the Hungarian economy's international integration 
is another major goal of economic policy. Export orientation, 
foreign economic opening, and an increasing presence of foreign 
capital are the keys to economic success throughout the world. 
This is the way we can have access to the indispensable 
additional capital, the way modern technology can become 
widespread in our economy, and the way Hungarian enterprises can 
acquire markets. We have to accept the costs of this, namely 
the discontinuation of uncompetitive domestic enterprises and 
product cultures. 
  Preventing the division of society is the third priority. 
Certain elementary social guarantees have to be ensured for 
everyone. Therefore, compulsory health insurance has to be 
maintained so that all citizens can have access to health care. 
Basically, the system of family supplement also has to be 
maintained, a mininum basic pension has to be ensured for 
everyone, and we have to ensure that the increase of pensions 
does not lag behind the wage increases. 
  2. Economic change and the stimulation of enterprises make 
it unavoidable for the differentiation of incomes which is 
unusual in Hungary to be maintained in the coming years. The 
unfavorable effects of this have to be reduced by welfare 
guarantees but cannot completely be eliminated. Economic 
considerations demand that, in the course of privatization, 
people who can contribute to restoring the former state 
properties with their own capital and management expertise 
should first become proprietors. However, this inevitably leads 
to a smaller segment of society becoming owners and to 
significant differences arising in assets. 
  The economic crisis, the assertion of the rights of freedom, 
and the opening of the borders together caused the sudden 
increase of the crime rate. We know that totalitarian 
dictatorships normally have better public order than free 
countries. However, rather than reinstating the total control 
of a police state or closing the borders, we wish to act against 
this by strengthening the police force, defending the injured 
parties, and modernizing the prison conditions. It has to be 
seen that public order and security can only be improved 
gradually; this is the cost of freedom. 
  Something else the SZDSZ government will not solve in the 
coming four years: It will not place all those people who have 
in recent years been building the SZDSZ's organizations into 
well-paid positions or supervisory committees, thus making them 
satisfied. In personnel decision, we consider expertise and 
management skills as guidelines rather than party membership. 
Not all honest and brave Free Democrat activists are experts of 
banking or theater life.

  [Text] Solidarity representatives issued a statement in 
Katowice yesterday relating to the conditions for the suspension 
of the strikes. Here is the union spokesman, Piotr Zak: 
  [Begin Zak recording] We are asking Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak and Industry and Trade Minister Mark Pol to hold a 
direct, working meeting between representatives of the 
government and the mining and energy generation secretariat of 
the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] Solidarity. 
The aim of the meeting will be to specify the range and 
timetable of talks intended to resolve the problems lying at the 
root of the conflict. For some time, the Solidarity trade union 
has, as it were, reached out to the authorities, proposing 
substantive talks with the aim of resolving the conflict that 
has arisen. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent Orzech reporting from Katowice] A 
representative of the brown coal-mining section of Solidarity 
threatened that if these talks are not held, a strike will once 
more begin at the brown coal mines. Simultaneously, an activist 
of the energy generation section warned that there might be 
wide-scale cuts in electric power supplies, and that these will 
not exclude the mass media. The trade unionists said that a 
timetable of strikes has been prepared, but that it must remain 
secret. According to Marian Krzaklewski, a scenario is also 
being prepared to meet the situation that would arise if the 
government rejects talks. Krzysztof Mlodzik, chairman of the 
mining and energy generation secretariat, said toward the end of 
the news conference that it would be wiser to give way. He did 
not make clear what he had in mind. This is Witold Orzech in 
Katowice. 
  [Announcer] On the "Signals of the Day" program this 
morning, Labor Minister Leszek Miller addressed yesterday's 
statement by Solidarity's national mining section regarding 
talks with the government: 
  [Begin Miller recording] We are open for various contacts 
with representatives of Solidarity. If such a meeting were to 
have a consultative character -- by this I mean one during which 
the both the subjects and the participants are specified -- such 
talks can certainly come about, such a team can certainly be 
created. On the other hand, I would here like to clearly 
distinguish between a consultative meeting and a negotiating 
meeting. As regards negotiations, our stance is unchanged. We 
invite representatives of other trade unions active in the 
mining sector to these talks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
correspondent Magda Pospisilova; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Pospisilova] A number of opposition politicians 
said this week that rumors about the postponement of the 
elections scheduled to be held this autumn were not mere idle 
talk. The interview you gave to last Monday's edition of NARODNA 
OBRODA seems to have confirmed such rumors. 
  [Moravcik] This is definitely not the case. We have made a 
decision. The parliament has approved the relevant 
constitutional law and set the date of the elections and this is 
binding for us. Therefore, nothing has happened. 
  [Pospisilova] It has been claimed that a pretext for 
postponing the date of the election from autumn could be the 
issue of the entry in the identity card testifying to 
citizenship of the Slovak Republic. The fact is that this entry 
is posing a problem. Regrettably the relevant authorities have 
up to now done nothing to resolve the matter. 
  [Moravcik] It is really not true that nothing is being done 
in this matter. When discussing the bill amending the existing 
law on elections we also examined that problem. It can be 
resolved technically. This is matter that the finance minister 
will have to tackle so that the elections can take place without 
a hitch. 
  [Pospisilova] Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for 
a 
Democratic Slovakia, said that the National Council was 
experiencing a deep political and moral crisis and that he was 
not certain whether it would last until the autumn elections. 
What do you think? Will it last? 
  [Moravcik] The question is, who was it who caused this deep 
moral crisis? It would be apt and very useful if former Prime 
Minister Meciar examined his own conscience. I believe, 
however, that what happened in connection with the vote of no 
confidence in Vladimir Meciar resulted in the consolidation of 
the parliament, making it capable of taking action -- although 
problems naturally keep cropping up. We have, however, been 
successful in overcoming these problems and have to do 
everything possible to ensure that the plan we have set 
ourselves concerning legislative tasks facing the government is 
implemented. We must indeed be successful in this endeavor. 
  [Pospisilova] Your government survived the first stern 
parliamentary test this week. The opposition failed to secure a 
vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. One 
can, however, hear voices that similar motions of no confidence 
are being planned for the coming parliamentary meetings. 
  [Moravcik] This method should not become an accepted thing 
in 
our parliament. We have to express ourselves very critically on 
the course of action chosen by the present opposition when, with 
no justification whatsoever, it proposes such motions. On the 
one hand we are wasting time, which is very precious. We are 
wasting resources since deputies, who on the whole are well 
paid, could do a more useful job and not have to listen to 
fabricated arguments. [passage omitted] 
  [Pospisilova] You are therefore not afraid of this? 
  [Moravcik] Of course, we have a sufficient amount of 
self-confidence because we feel that there is nothing that might 
realistically threaten the government position of any member of 
the present cabinet. [passage omitted] 
  [Pospisilova] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova 
and 
Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus have stressed repeatedly that the 
abolition of the so-called old clearing account for payments 
between the Czech and Slovak Republics could not come out of 
meetings between experts and that a political decision is 
needed. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has, however, let it 
be known that in this matter he has nothing to discuss with you. 
He said moreover that he is not certain whether the Slovak side 
had a detailed knowledge of the given problem. What will be 
your answer to him, Mr. Prime Minister? 
  [Moravcik] We have examined the payments agreement between 
the Czech and Slovak republics, including the problem of the old 
clearing account. We have also consulted foreign experts. It 
has been shown that that agreement was a bad one; that it was 
rather disadvantageous precisely for Slovakia, especially as far 
as the old account was concerned. Since it is disadvantageous 
for Slovakia it is on the whole natural that it is in our 
interest to have it amended. Therefore, from this viewpoint, the 
situation is on the whole unequivocal. I firmly believe that the 
representatives of the Czech Republic will be accommodating 
toward us in this matter. [passage omitted] 
  [Pospisilova] Vaclav Klaus wants to discuss with you the 
issue concerning the border area at Kasarna. What is the 
attitude of the Slovak Government in this case? 
  [Moravcik] Unchanged, so far. This means we see no reason 
why there should be an exchange of territory in that locality.

  [Text] Belgrade 8 May (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], who 
arrived in Belgrade today, called for the lifting of the 
blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and 
announced that his party will do everything to ensure that the 
Russian Duma reaches a decision to that effect at its session on 
11 May. Asked about the precise date when sanctions against the 
FRY will be lifted, Zhirinovskiy said that this will happen "the 
day after the results of the elections for new Russian president 
are revealed." He pointed out that he will speak at a rally in 
Belgrade's Republic Square to mark the 49th anniversary of the 
victory against German fascism and imperialism, regardless of 
the fact that the rally has been banned. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, the ban was not unexpected. He 
sees it as a "maneuver" because, as he pointed out, "somebody 
wants to be friends with both us and the NATO, but this is 
useless." As announced, the leader of the LDPR, who arrived at 
the invitation of the Serb National Renewal [SNO], is expected 
to meet representatives of the FRY and Serbian assemblies as 
well as representatives of the republic of Srpska and the 
republic of Serb Krajina [in Croatia]. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, he has arrived in Belgrade 
heading 
a "specific delegation" consisting of "representatives of 
legislative authorities and military experts." During his 
meeting with the press he reiterated his opposition to foreign 
involvement in the territory of former Yugoslavia and warned 
western states against testing the power of the Russian Army. 
  According to him, there are two solutions to the crisis in 
the Balkans -- the first one is for the Balkan peoples to decide 
for themselves how they want to live, and the second one is to 
send 100,000 or 200,000 Russian soldiers, at the invitation of 
the Serbian side, "to bring order to the Balkans within a month." 
  Zhirinovskiy noted that the LDPR will make efforts to have 
the Russian right of veto in the UN Security Council used to 
prevent implementation of any measures against the FRY. He 
accused NATO of refusing to listen to the "voice of common 
sense" from Moscow and of wanting to test the strength of 
Russia. "Our army showed what it could do 49 years ago. If they 
want to test its power again, they will be able to test it in 
their countries' capitals," Zhirinovskiy said. He stressed that 
another 22 June (the date when Nazi Germany attacked USSR in 
1941) will not happen again, because "we will begin [our 
attacks] a few days before that." Stressing that the LDPR is on 
the Serb side, he warned: "We can drop ten times as many bombs 
on the towns from where the planes which bomb peaceful towns in 
Yugoslavia take off." 
  State Duma Deputy President Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, who is a 
member of the delegation, called for a military and political 
alliance between the Balkans and Russia. He said that under the 
Balkans he also means the new states -- the republic of Srpska 
and the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]. He said that the 
invitations extended to the presidents of the RS and RSK, 
Radovan Karadzic and Milan Martic, are signs of recognition of 
the new states. 
  SNO president Mirko Jovic explained that the SNO invited 
Zhirinovskiy because "the LDPR is the only force in the world 
that can destroy the ghastly idea of the so-called unitary world 
state," and also because they want to give relevant information 
to the Russian delegation, which they will need in the 
discussion on the lifting of the sanctions in the Russian 
parliament.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Branko Geroski: "Disputable `Mileage' for </F>
General Tellefsen"] 
  [Text] Brigadier General Tryggwe Tellefsen, UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] commander for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], recently visited Nis, where he 
had discussions with representatives of the General Staff of the 
Yugoslav Army. The news broadcast by Macedonian Television 
described the visit as "technical" (as was, allegedly, the 
character of the meeting), which was why it was not even noted 
by the press. In a statement for this most powerful of the 
media, General Tellefsen told the Macedonian public that he had 
had talks with Serbian officers about some "minor" questions: 
How to avoid border incidents between the "blue helmets" and 
Yugoslav troops; how to establish normal communications and 
exchanges of information between the two sides (in the case, the 
two sides are the Yugoslav Army and UNPROFOR)... together with 
other similar "technical" trifles that should not excite the 
public unduly. 
  Unfortunately, not everything is as straightforward and 
simple as it may first appear. This is at least because of two 
unusually "strong" statements made by Mr. Tellefsen. The first 
is the information about the increased presence of Serbian 
military formations near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border, 
allegedly because of some Yugoslav Army maneuvers. The 
Macedonian public had not been informed about any maneuvers near 
its border or about the unusual presence of military formations 
on the other side of the border (this "line" should normally be 
taken conditionally, because there is no marked or defined 
line). Nevertheless, being a serious soldier, General Tellefsen 
does not talk nonsense (God forbid!), which means that there 
must have been some unusual activities on the other side of the 
border. Before this statement, the public had probably been 
generously spared this information. Let us now not split hairs 
or broach the question about "normal" communications between two 
states, when one of them violates normal procedures for 
informing the other whenever it undertakes unusual military 
activities in the vicinity of its border. This is the Balkans 
and one should not expect such good manners. 
  The second statement made by Tellefsen is rather more 
serious: Namely, if we have understood it correctly, the general 
said that there is around 140 km of Macedonian-Yugoslav border 
regarded as disputable, militarily speaking. The border, as we 
know, has not been marked with posts, but there is the practice 
from former Yugoslavia and there are some administrative borders 
that Macedonia, at least until this statement was issued, 
assumed were undisputable -- according to statements made by 
government officials, there are only a few points on the border 
that are in dispute. General Tellefsen owes the government and 
the broader public a serious explanation about the criteria by 
which 140 km of the northern border (from Kumanovo to the 
Bulgarian border) is being regarded as disputable. 
  There is no trickery here: General Tellefsen starts out from 
real problems faced by his soldiers -- incidents and so on. 
Wherever one happens, it certainly represents a "disputable" 
space for the UN peacekeepers. The trouble is that in each such 
individual case the "disputable" nature is defined by the 
Serbian border guards. So far there has not been a case of the 
Macedonian border guards or the "blue" observers capturing or 
kidnapping a Serbian patrol on territory that can be defined as 
"disputable" by the Macedonian side. 
  The UNPROFOR delegation, General Tellefsen stated, had 
agreed 
to a certain "good will" procedure with the representatives of 
the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army in such unfortunate 
cases. In brief, it was agreed that if the peacekeepers were 
accidentally to stray into "disputable" (read: Serbian) 
territory, the Serbian guards should be "gentle" and 
understanding. Moreover: The Serbian side will inform UNPROFOR 
about military exercises and maneuvers in order to avoid 
incidents. (But will anybody officially inform Macedonia?) 
  At first sight, it is good that some kind of procedure has 
been established to avoid unnecessary incidents. However, it is 
possible to view this in another way. Namely, the situation on 
the territory (these unmarked borders) could remain so for 
years. During all that time the Macedonian border guards and 
the "Macedonian" UNPROFOR members will establish certain 
practices to resolve incidents. With each case, point by point, 
part after part of the territory that official Macedonia does 
not see as disputable will be treated as such. All this will be 
done along these 140 km, which even General Tellefsen regards as 
disputable. Is this not a dangerous precedent before the future 
necessary demarcation of the border? 
  This is why we conclude that it would have been an 
elementary rule to have at least the formal presence of a 
representative of the Macedonian Government there. General 
Tellefsen could have independently informed his Serbian 
collocutors about his units, have any kind of fruitful 
conversations, even about the mentioned incidents, but the 
moment the Macedonian-Yugoslav border was mentioned and treated 
as partly "disputable," the subject unquestionably became 
political. The discussions of issues of such a kind without the 
presence of Macedonian representatives is a weird gesture, if 
not more than that. 
  Nevertheless, let us be realistic: General Tellefsen is a 
soldier. The man has real problems on the ground and that is 
why his conduct is militarily pragmatic. The problems, or at 
least so it seems, have been solved. The general has no strict 
obligation to understand our sensitivities when the border is at 
stake or to demonstrate good manners in front of his good hosts. 
The problem is that the Defense Ministry did not react, and 
official Macedonia did not react. Not for the sake of 
unnecessary quarreling with UNPROFOR (God forbid!) but to make 
it clear that neither directly, nor "military" or "technically," 
can our borders be discussed without our presence. 
  The UNPROFOR peacekeepers are staying in Macedonia without 
any official arrangement, and our requests for a definition of 
the special mandate of the forces in Macedonia have been 
repeatedly ignored. All of this can be considered as of minor 
importance, because what really matters is the peace mission. 
However, that is not a good enough reason for the lack of 
official contacts with Macedonia in this case. There still 
remains the statement that half of our northern border is 
disputable and it really will be most typical if it remains 
hanging over us in this way.

  [Excerpts] Kragujevac, 8 May (TANJUG) -- The Serbian people 
will on no account allow any threats to the territorial link 
between the Serb lands, despite our lasting commitment to peace 
and a political solution, Milan Martic, president of the 
republic of Serb Krajina, told "The Hallmark of the Times" 
program of Kragujevac radio. [passage omitted] 
  Asked why the talks between the republic of Serb Krajina and 
Croatia had been delayed and when they will resume, Martic said: 
"This is not up to us. We insist that the talks take place at a 
neutral venue and on equal footing for both sides. The 
condition for continuing the talks is the removal of Paragraph 
12 of the UN Security Council Resolution 820, relating to 
exports and imports. Making any concessions to Croatia, even 
when it comes to transport links, is out of the question unless 
we are treated equally. Gaining transport links would mean 
nothing to us if we cannot export or import goods, and for that 
it is necessary to remove Resolution 820." 
  Asked to comment on the increasingly frequent statements by 
western and Croatian politicians about the reintegration of the 
republic of Serb Krajina into Croatia, with a high degree of 
autonomy, Martic said: "These are merely their wishes." He 
added: "We are convinced we are fighting for the survival of the 
Serb people and we will persist in it to the very end." 
  "We will not give in on our basic demand -- the right to 
self- determination of our people, as guaranteed to all other 
peoples in the world."

  [Text] Dear listeners: We have just received a copy of 
the letter thatAlija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has sent to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  Mr. Secretary General: Your envoy for Yugoslavia, Mr. 
Yasushi Akashi, has, with his latest actions, destroyed the 
minimum of trust that is a precondition for any kind of 
cooperation. Our people and the international public have for a 
long time been witness to his strange and incomprehensible 
techniques in handling the basic issues of war or peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In our view, his conduct and decisions 
regarding the crisis in Gorazde are clearly contrary to the 
corresponding Security Council resolutions and NATO decisions. 
They have helped the aggressor to maintain his machine for 
killing people and destroying cities. In granting permission to 
Karadzic's Serbs yesterday to allow the passage of tanks through 
the zone strictly forbidden for heavy arms, and securing an 
escort for these tanks to be moved to new positions, Mr. Akashi 
has effectively sided with the aggressor. I am sure that no 
well-intentioned person, including his closest associates, can 
understand or explain Mr. Akashi's conduct. It is no wonder 
that the Serbs are ignoring the decisions of the international 
community if its official representatives fail to observe them. 
The result of such conduct is an endless continuation of the 
war, which has entered its third year in this region, and an 
increasing remoteness of any chances for peace. 
  Mr. Secretary General, it is my duty to inform you that 
these 
reasons make it impossible for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government 
to continue to cooperate with Mr. Akashi. 
  Respectfully yours, Alija Izetbegovic

  [Text] Jagodina, 7 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, told Radio 
Jagodina today that Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy, is a man of peace and an esteemed diplomat and 
that it is for this reason that the Muslims consider him 
unsuitable. 
  "All diplomats and soldiers who have been objective and 
unbiased in their quest for peace in these parts have been 
branded as undesirables by the Muslims, who demanded their 
dismissal," Krajisnik said. He stressed: "It is certain that 
the Muslim government is backed and instigated by the United 
States in its demand for Akashi's removal." 
  "To claim that Akashi has sided with the Serbs is an 
abhorrent lie," Krajisnik said. Although he is undoubtedly one 
of those responsible for the bombing of Serb positions around 
Gorazde, in our books he is not among those most responsible. 
That is why we are certainly not in favor of his dismissal, and 
I hope that this will not happen," Krajisnik said.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Sali Berisha by unidentified Radio </F>
Deutsche Welle correspondent on 23 April; place not given: "Is 
Greece a Compass for Serbian Policy?"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the 
proposal by the Serbian President Milosevic in Romania about the 
creation of a confederation of Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania, 
Albania, and so on? 
  [Berisha] The Serbian president would have done much better, 
I think, if he had given peace and stability to the Bosnian 
people and had given orders to the Karadzic-type criminals to 
stop bombarding Gorazde and obey the will of the EC and the 
norms regulating peace and good relations among countries. That 
would have been a valuable contribution by him to the solution 
of the conflict that was started by Belgrade and is still being 
ferociously backed by it. There can be no way of establishing 
any federation or confederation as long as Serbian aggression is 
creating thousands of victims. It is a mere farce, a phoney 
proposal reflecting Serbia's integrationist plans tantamount to 
the Greater Serbia idea, aggression, and conflict in the Balkans. 
  [Correspondent] Neither Montenegro, Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], or Kosova were 
mentioned at all in Milosevic's draft constitutions. What does 
this augur for the Albanian territories? 
  [Berisha] It shows that President Milosevic, in accordance 
with the Memorandum of the (Serbian) Academy of Sciences [on the 
formation of a Greater Serbia], is going out of his way to draw 
all these territories into a Greater Serbia. There is no doubt 
that he has come up with this proposal just to be able to make 
Serbia the dominant factor and ensure its hegemony over the 
Balkans. However, I must stress here that the idea of a Greater 
Serbia and its domination over the Balkans can never bring 
stability to the region and, historically speaking, it is an 
erroneous and totally groundless idea. The Balkans can never be 
given stability by those who set it on fire. It would be absurd 
to claim that the Balkans could be dominated by a population 
that accounts for no more than 10 percent of the entire 
population of the region. I am of the opinion that Serbia must 
once and for all renounce its policy of aggression and war, and 
naturally after this there must be a policy of cooperation 
throughout the Balkan peninsula. 
  [Correspondent] What would you say about President Clinton's 
proposal, and what would be your comment on NATO's steps and 
military intervention against Serbia? 
  [Berisha] I have stressed in the past, and I would like to 
stress again, that the restoration of NATO's credibility is of 
tremendous importance to the solution of this conflict that has 
swept over the region and to the prevention of other conflicts 
in the Balkans. I have welcomed all President Clinton's 
proposals and I hope that the Atlantic union and NATO will put 
them into practice. It is impermissible that a gang of bandits 
and criminals with 30 or 50 tanks should humiliate universal 
principles and the international community, thus causing the 
greatest human slaughter that Europe has witnessed since World 
War II. 
  [Correspondent] What is your opinion on Milosevic's proposal 
for dialogue... 
  [Berisha] Albania has already expressed its view on this 
matter: It is and always will be in favor of dialogue and 
negotiations. The only way to resolve problems is to recognize 
realities and evaluate them, not ignore them. I am certain that 
a dialogue of this kind between Milosevic and Rugova, under the 
auspices of a third party, would lead to the solution of the 
Kosova issue. 
  [Correspondent] What are the prospects for Albania's 
relations with Greece in the wake of the border incident? 
  [Berisha] It is rather difficult to define the prospects for 
our relations with Greece, because unfortunately Greece through 
its actions has turned into a compass, as it were, for the 
aggressive Serbian policy in the Balkans. So, while there is 
war going on in the north and a policy in the south that favours 
aggression and creates tensions in the Balkans, our relations 
with Greece remain tense. However, I would like to express 
Albania's determination to overcome, through dialogue with 
Greece, the great problems created in the Peshkopia area. There 
are many plans under way proportionately to expand the number of 
our two countries' diplomats, and these plans will be discussed 
as early as 3 May, when our two foreign ministers will meet in 
Geneva. We intend to make our contribution to the success of 
this meeting and the reduction of tensions in the southern 
Balkans, but the truth is that Greece is deeply affected by 
chauvinism.

<F P=106> [Article by Arjan Sokoli: "Why Is Our Diplomacy In a Blind </F>
Alley Regarding the Albanian Question?"] 
  [Text] Our president's foreign policy has recently been 
marked by intensive visits abroad and receptions of numerous 
foreign dignitaries in Tirana. Leaving aside the frills of 
expanding bilateral links, various possible fields of investment 
in Albania, and promises by our friends (that in fact have 
remained only on paper), the dialogue has always been focused on 
the problem of Kosova and its future, which is our nation's 
number one problem. This problem has become more acute in view 
of the close prospect of a solution to the Bosnian-Serbian 
conflict and the creation of a Bosnian-Croat Federation. In this 
respect, there is a lot of talk about the danger of the war 
spreading toward southern Serbia, into Kosova and beyond. 
Warnings and predictions that such an extension of the conflict 
would involve several Balkan countries come from various 
quarters. In order to avoid a new Balkan war, almost all 
European and Balkan diplomatic circles, in conjunction with the 
United States, are insisting that the Albanian issue be 
sacrificed. Calls of alarm and intimidation are heard by the 
Albanians from all sides: "Be careful! Keep calm, control 
yourselves, and be wise enough not to anger Serbia. We are 
ready to help you in everything, provided you give up the idea 
of a 'Kosova Republic' or 'an independent and neutral state of 
Kosova.' Hold on and be patient, just be patient" (meaning 
"submit, submit, always submit"). 
  Our diplomacy seems to be greatly committed to the solution 
of the Kosova issue and the problem of all the other Albanians 
living outside their motherland. As already mentioned above, 
there is a lot of talk going on, interviews given, and articles 
written. However, what will be the ultimate outcome of it all? 
  President Berisha's diplomatic mission in March 1994 to 
London -- a traditionally anti-Albanian capital as far as the 
Kosova problem, and therefore the Albanian problem, are 
concerned -- was evidence of our national policy succumbing to 
the request, or rather the European and U.S. decision, that 
Albania be compelled to accept "enlarged autonomy" for Kosova 
under the former Yugoslavia. Even that kind of autonomy -- and 
one never knows what is actually meant by the term "enlarged" -- 
could be achieved only if Serbia were to accept it. President 
Rugova's line for Kosova to be "an independent, neutral state 
under UN control" still hangs in the air. London, for the third 
time this century, has buried our hopes of liberating Kosova 
from the Serbian-Slav yoke. The Albanians' policy of peace and 
restraint in the face of the barbarous Serbian repression, a 
policy that was highly commended on both sides of the Atlantic, 
resulted almost in suicide. International diplomacy again left 
the Albanians in the lurch with an extremely bitter taste of 
frustration and disappointment, but this time the reasons for it 
included also our political naivete, tribal ego-tripping, and 
national disunity. 
  Leaving the British capital with a feeling of legitimate 
anger and admirable energy, our president found himself two days 
later in Turkey, where he was received with the highest honors. 
It is clear that all this haste had nothing to do with either 
the signing of an agreement, the lifting of reciprocal taxes, 
the smooth payment of the debt we owe Turkey, or boosting 
Turkish investment in Albania. 
  His main concern was again the Kosova issue, where he hoped 
that the failure suffered in London would in some way or another 
be compensated by support offered to us by our traditional 
friend. From what we could learn from the interview given by 
Turkish President Demirel to Albanian Television journalist Reis 
Cico about the stand that Turkey would take if the Serbs spread 
the conflict toward Kosova, the Turkish leader replied that "we 
will assist Kosova and Albania" -- a declaration of particular 
importance. However, that declaration did not speak of any 
support for the Kosova people's desire for self-determination, 
and far less did it mention any Turkish acceptance of Kosova as 
an independent, neutral state being an option. Why then did Mr. 
Cico not ask the Turkish president this question, which 
constitutes the Albanians' fundamental national problem? It is 
not difficult to understand the reason for such "carelessness." 
We think, as far as this problem is concerned, that it is 
because our president's visit to Ankara had extremely bitter 
results. It seems our Islamic ally is much more interested in 
reviving its ancient influence on our troubled peninsula, 
solving the Serbian-Bosnian conflict, and creating an 
independent Bosnian state, than in creating a neutral state of 
Kosova, independent of Serbia. At the same time, Demirel's 
fatherland cannot opt out of implementing the other NATO 
countries' policy. Its aid toward Albania also has to be within 
the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. It could raise certain 
objections to the EC sluggishness over the Balkan crisis, but 
not to the sluggishness over the Albanian-Serb issue. Moreover, 
one must not forget the strained Greek-Turkish relations over 
the Cyprus affair, and Turkey's desire to play a prominent role 
in the Black Sea countries' cooperation project. 
  The conclusion is that the Turkish rejection of our option 
for Kosova was yet another failure of our diplomacy following 
the one in London. On his return to Albania, President Berisha 
on 8 April met with another top dignitary, a Western one -- the 
commander-in-chief of NATO troops in Europe, U.S. Army General 
George Joulwan. During the talks, our president assured the 
general that Albania would fulfill all her obligations stemming 
from the Partnership for Peace agreement with the utmost 
readiness and devotion. It became clear from those talks (as 
far as we could learn from the television) that our President 
Berisha was mainly asking NATO to guarantee Albania's 
independence against any possible Serbian-Montenegrin 
aggression. Yet the Kosova problem was once more left out of 
the discussions, and thus out of NATO's concern. 
  The commander-in-chief of the great Western military 
alliance 
showed considerable interest in, and remained very satisfied 
with, the airfields, port facilities, and military bases that 
Albania, as a country of strategic importance in the region, has 
put at NATO's unconditional disposal. As for our national 
question -- the Kosova question -- not a single word was uttered 
by the U.S. army general (again according to what was said on 
the television) during a news conference by [Albanian Minister 
of Defense] Zhulali and Joulwan. Berisha's request for increased 
U.S. presence in the region has to do with the Balkan crisis, 
the restoration of peace in Bosnia, and the prevention of the 
conflict from spreading toward southern Yugoslavia, rather than 
with the Kosova people's aspiration for an independent and 
neutral state. 
  Finally, there are the results of the talks with Klaus 
Kinkel, German vice chancellor and foreign minister. He assured 
Albania of support in all fields, promising heaven and earth. 
However, as for the Kosova issue, nothing concrete was promised, 
because, as it transpired from the discussions, the German 
minister gained the impression that even his Albanian 
interlocutors did not know precisely what they wanted. 
  Why, then, has our diplomacy entered a blind alley over the 
Kosova issue -- the problem of our entire nation? There are a 
great number of reasons that require individual, deep analysis 
-- well- argued, mature, analysis showing patriotic courage. In 
this analysis we are going to deal with just one of them. Our 
Albanian diplomacy, on both sides of the border, does not have 
any national political platform. The commendable work by 
certain political and intellectual forces to chart a unified and 
binding national policy has been attacked and sabotaged by the 
Albanian state and its ruling parties. Our Albanian diplomacy 
is faced with an impasse, and it will never result in any 
achievements, because it is unable (or unwilling) to devise a 
just resolution of the Albanian question, which is not only a 
problem relating to Kosova. It has not properly formulated the 
options that it has presented to the world, and, which is worse, 
it has mangled them, reducing to an absurd level the will 
expressed in a referendum by the Kosova people living in their 
own lands occupied by the Serbs. There can never be any 
prospect of success for a policy or diplomacy that fails to 
tackle the Albanian problem as a whole, including the Kosova 
issue as its indisputably main constituent part. The creation 
of a union of all Albanians living in their ethnic territories 
will be the only good solution for the Albanians, the Balkans, 
Europe, as well as Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] themselves.

  [Excerpt] Party leaders have drawn the first conclusions 
from yesterday's election round. Kata Peli Nagy went to a press 
briefing by the Socialists. 
  [Peli Nagy] To preserve, to renew, and to surpass -- these 
are the guidelines for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
after its partial victory yesterday; that is, to preserve the 
values of the past four years and to achieve what the previous 
government forgot to accomplish. So there will be no big 
clearout, or even a little one. This was confirmed by Zoltan 
Gal, leader of the MSZP parliamentary group. 
  The intention behind these tactics, according to the party, 
is that the position of the left has to be consolidated during 
the next four years and this can only be accomplished through 
successful governing. 
  Talking about the more and more pressing coalition 
questions, 
Imre Szekeres confirmed that a decision will only be made after 
the second round. However, he listed four criteria which will 
form the basis of negotiations. The most decisive factor in 
choosing partners will be to establish an agreement about the 
first six months' government program, about the structure and 
style of the new government, and on whether the other partner 
will be able to accept that negotiations will have to be carried 
out with the civil and interest protection organizations. 
  Szekeres announced that the MSZP does not regard Gabor 
Kuncze, Viktor Orban, Laszlo Surjan, Jozsef Torgyan, or Peter 
Boross as prime minister candidates of the MSZP. Even in case 
of an absolute majority they would like to unite the country's 
best forces. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to Imre Szekeres, executive deputy 
chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], if the MSZP 
wins the elections, the return of the nomenclature which existed 
four years ago is out of the question. Szekeres, speaking on 
the "Sunrise" program on Hungarian television, confirmed that 
even if the MSZP obtains the absolute majority of the votes, it 
would consider it necessary to have the broadest possible 
coalition government. Although many expect it, the MSZP does 
not intend to bring the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] into the government. The reason for this is the KDNP's 
performance over the past four years. 
  Imre Szekeres and Ivan Petoe, chairman of the Alliance of 
Free Democrats, who also participated in the TV program, both 
agreed that the tone of the elections ought not to change in the 
second round. In their view, the voters should concentrate on 
the individual candidates of the parties, and it would be 
desirable if these candidates could have an opportunity to 
introduce themselves to the electorate on Channel 1 of Hungarian 
Television, and not only on cable television.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Laszlo Hovanyecz: "Calmly"] </F>
  [Text] This is the big task now: To be calm -- regardless 
of the fact that some people call the events that have happened 
a sweeping, annihilating victory and others call it a defeat. 
We must look into the future with calm. 
  Up to now, it was possible to talk about intrigues, 
falsifications, and ill-willed predictions. However, from now, 
we can only talk about facts; that the majority politics of 
recent times have failed. 
  The power that gained the majority in 1990 has lost the 
people's confidence. It can search for excuses in the 
international situation, in world economic recession, in the 
country's desperate situation, and we could carry on listing the 
many negative circumstances. All these do not excuse them the 
same way as these did not excuse the stupid actions of the 
previous regime. History does not grant acquittals for 
failures, even in situations a thousand times more difficult 
than what we have had. Especially that the social lifting power 
of the change of the regime offered exceptional opportunities 
after the change. Lessons can always be learned. 
  For the power that, in all probability, will have to say 
goodbye after the [second round of] elections in three weeks' 
time, the main lesson will obviously be that dialogue with 
society cannot be neglected by any political force. Those who 
have been leading the country up to now believed that that they 
infallibly knew the wishes of the "people" and the "nation." In 
the meantime, they humiliated the object and subject of their 
governing every day. 
  They deliberately confused the Rakosi and the Kadar regimes 
and the various phases of the latter. This carried the message 
that the people were like a flock of sheep that was waiting for 
a good shepherd to appear from nowhere. If someone believes and 
even keeps repeating that this people is waiting for "bread for 
3.60" [price in forints for kilo of bread in Kadar's time], he 
is wrong and even deceives himself. Contrary to all belittling 
assumptions, Hungarian people can count very well. Rather than 
bread for 3.60, milk for 3, or sausage for 2, people first, 
second, and third want dignity. They wish for their abilities 
and performance to be recognized, and for their leaders to give 
free scope to their creative abilities. The country has mainly 
been disappointed in this wish in the past four years. We are 
probably right in assuming that this is the reason it voted the 
way it did. 
  Naturally, all this also has lessons for the future. Those 
newly coming to power will have to deal with the same people 
desiring dignity. Sober-minded politicians cannot believe that 
it is good to produce radical government changes every four 
years. To put it differently, it is not at all wise or bearable 
to provide the grounds for such a deep disappointment. Those 
coming to power as a result of this year's elections will have 
to assess, thoroughly, the current successes, and even more 
carefully, the reasons for the failure of the current losers. 
As a result, they will have to conclude the following. First: 
They have to come to an understanding with the people. Second: 
They have to come to an understanding with the opposition. And 
third: They have to prepare for both keeping and handing over 
power. 
  Assessing all this calmly, those who are coming to power 
will 
have to be clear that "their coming into position" means that 
they respect the nation's dignity and they interpret popular 
sovereignty to be supreme, above themselves.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Egerer, head of the National Security </F>
Office's Constitutional Protection Directorate, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given: "On the Renewed 
Hungarist Movement -- High-Ranking National Security Leader 
Gives Interview to NEPSZABADSAG"] 
  [Text] On 5 May a Budapest court approved keeping Albert 
Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos, leaders of the Hungarist Movement, on 
remand, which had been ordered on 2 May, because of the 
increased danger that they might commit more crimes. We 
interviewed Laszlo Egerer, leader of the National Security 
Office's Constitutional Protection Directorate, on the 
background to the appearance of the successor to the former 
Arrow-Cross organization [Hungarian fascist organization during 
the Nazi period]. 
  [Egerer] Arrow-Cross and National Socialist parties operated 
in Hungary from 1935, mostly following Ferenc Szalasi. The 
establishment of the Hungarist Movement coincided with the 
launching of the National Socialist Hungarian Party in March 
1938. Pal Teleki's government dissolved it but, under German 
pressure, it again became legal under a different name and, as 
the Arrow-Cross Party, it came to power on 15 October 1944. 
  After World War II, afraid of reprisals for the war crimes 
and crimes against humanity committed by them, many members of 
the Hungarist Movement emigrated to various countries of the 
world. After emigrating, representatives and sympathizers of 
Arrow-Cross power established regional groups -- in Australia, 
Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Western Europe 
-- of the Hungarist Movement. Their activities were mostly 
limited to publishing their internally circulating journal, UT 
ES CEL [ROAD AND GOAL], and to organizing local events. 
Personal conflicts, rivalry, and dissent by the leaders and the 
membership characterized this movement from the beginning. From 
1945 to 1975, former Arrow- Cross leader Arpad Henney headed the 
movement, having been appointed by Szalasi as his political 
successor. After Henney's death, Imre Tatar Tarjanyi, who was 
living in Germany, became the movement's leader and kept this 
role until autumn 1993. At the time, he was a parliamentary 
deputy for the Arrow-Cross Party. 
  [Correspondent] We have arrived at the present. How has the 
Hungarist Movement been reorganized? 
  [Egerer] After the change of the regime, the Hungarist 
Movement's emigre organizations made contact with extreme 
right-wing groups in Hungary so as to make Hungarism legitimate 
as a political line, and to rehabilitate Szalasi's Arrow-Cross 
dictatorship. After 1990, many elderly activists of the 
movement came to Hungary and personally tried to do something to 
achieve these goals. In the course of this, the Hungarist 
Movement's representatives from Australia, Canada, and the 
United States made contact with Istvan Gyorkos, the leader of 
the illegal extreme right-wing organization the Hungarian 
National Front [Magyar Nemzeti Arcvonal], who was accepted as 
the domestic representative and maintainer of Hungarist 
traditions. The international and domestic media coverage of 
the criminal proceedings launched against Gyorkos in 1992 played 
a part in this because this introduced him to the extreme 
right-wing emigre groups. Through his contacts, Gyorkos often 
received financial support from Western emigres to establish the 
Hungarist Movement in Hungary. In addition to this, extreme 
right-wing Hungarian propaganda publications -- UT ES CEL -- and 
reprinted books of the ideologists of Hungarism -- Szalasi, 
Istoczy, and Marschalko -- were often sent to Gyorkos and other 
extreme right-wing activists for further circulation. 
  [Correspondent] When did Albert Szabo appear? 
  [Egerer] He returned home on the instruction of the 
Hungarist Movement's Australian group. Szabo has dual Hungarian 
and Australian citizenship. He held discussions with Gyorkos a 
number of times on coordinating the operation of the extreme 
right-wing groups and on presenting them as a united movement. 
However, the Hungarian branch of the Hungarist Movement was not 
formed because of its poor organization, lack of social support, 
and mainly the individual ambitions and rivalry between Gyorkos 
and Szabo. 
  In the autumn of 1993, the Hungarist groups operating among 
emigres in the West jointly declared that they were appointing 
Istvan Gyorkos as leader of the movement because the former 
leader Tarjanyi, living in Germany, could not carry out the work 
of directing the organization. Szabo did not accept this, tried 
to compete with Gyorkos, and established the World National 
Popular Rule Party. 
  In spring 1994, the foreign groups of the Hungarist Movement 
made Gyorkos and Szabo understand that they would only continue 
to support them financially if they appeared as a united 
movement in political life. It can be attributed to this and to 
the lack of success in the election campaign that the 
establishment of the Hungarian wing of the Hungarist Movement 
was announced on 27 April 1994. This was primarily a symbolic 
act, as only 11 people signed the minutes that registered the 
establishment. In spite of their loud statements about the 
broad social support for their "movement," the number of their 
sympathizers does not even extend to a few hundred. The vast 
majority of people belonging to this movement are not clear 
about the ideology or history of Hungarism, have a low 
intellectual level, and primitive opposition to Gypsies and 
Jews, and chauvinism dominate their views. 
  On 28 April 1994, on charges of conducting extremist 
propaganda activities, the police instituted criminal 
proceedings against Gyorkos and Szabo -- who call themselves the 
leaders of the Hungarist Movement in Hungary -- on the 
well-grounded suspicion of incitement against the community in 
violation of Paragraph 269 of the Penal Code. 
  [Correspondent] No proceedings have been initiated started 
against Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem, who appeared at the movement's 
gatherings together with the other two people. Why not? 
  [Egerer] In view of the facts known to us, the well-founded 
suspicion of incitement against the community under Paragraph 
269 of the Penal Code was not raised in his case.

  [Text] The State Assets Management Joint Stock Company 
[AVRT] has stopped the implementation of privatization deals. 
Agnes Papp reports on the background to this decision: 
  [Papp] The AVRT has suspended its sales activities and has 
confined its work until the formation of the new government to 
preparing privatization deals for decisions. This is what AVRT 
Managing Director Lajos Csepi told this program's correspondent. 
He explained his decision by saying that it is clear from the 
result of the first round of the parliamentary elections that 
the composition of the new government will be different from the 
old one and it is conceivable that the new government will 
choose a different privatization strategy, and potential new 
sales could limit this new concept. 
  On being asked why he did not respond to similar requests by 
the large parliamentary parties in the past, Lajos Csepi said 
that he needs government authorization to do it, and the 
government and the minister in charge of privatization have 
still not ordered the AVRT to suspend sales.

  [Text] Hungary will also ask the International Court in 
The Hague to conclude that Slovakia is not the "inheritor" of 
the CSFR-Hungarian agreement on the construction of the Bos 
power station, an agreement signed in 1977. We learned this 
from Laszlo Valki, a member of the group of Hungarian legal 
experts participating in the trial in The Hague, and one of the 
authors of the Hungarian lawsuit submitted to the International 
Court. 
  Laszlo Valki presented us with the Hungarian lawsuit 
consisting of eight points, a lawsuit fully written in English 
and submitted to the International Court in The Hague on 2 May. 
According to this document of claims, Hungary asks the 
International Court to conclude that: 
  1. Hungary had the right to halt and then abandon the 
construction in Nagymaros, as well as the construction projects 
it had to carry out at Bos in accordance with the agreement 
signed in 1977; 
  2. Czeckoslovakia did not have the right to build the C 
version (the document includes neither the expression "C 
version" nor the term "diversion of the Danube;" there is 
instead a long description, because the Slovaks only agreed to 
take the issue to the court in The Hague with this description); 
  3. Hungary abolished the 1977 agreement legitimately; 
  4. The 1977 agreement would have not remained in force 
anyway after 1 January 1993 due to the lack of a successor state; 
  5. Slovakia is responsible for its continued operation of 
the C version; 
  6. Slovakia is responsible for the damages and losses caused 
to Hungary and Hungarian citizens with the operation of the C 
version; 
  7. Slovakia is obliged to pay compensation for these 
damages, and Hungary will ask to set the amount of this 
compensation if the two sides fail to come to an agreement 
within six months after the International Court's decision; 
  8. Slovakia is obliged to fully redirect the Danube waters 
in the original Danube bed and restore former navigation on the 
river; Slovakia is also obliged to restore the original 
prevailing situation prior to the C version and guarantee that 
it will not repeat its damaging activity in the future. 
  Laszlo Valki described the contents of the Slovak claims in 
five points. According to this document, Slovakia asks the 
International Court to conclude the following: 
  1. The agreement of 1977 continues to be valid and, in this 
respect, Slovakia is the legal heir of the former CSSR; 
  2. Hungary did not have the right to halt and then abandon 
the construction at Nagymaros and the projects it had to carry 
out in the Bos area in accordance with the 1977 agreement; 
  3. The construction and operation of the C version was 
legal; 
  4. Hungary must halt any activity that hinders the 
implementation of the 1977 agreement and must continue the 
implementation of the stipulations of this agreement; 
  5. Hungary is obliged to pay compensation for all damages 
and losses caused to Slovakia, including interest and lost 
profits. The amount of this compensation will be probably be 
set in the second phase, following the first decision of the 
International Court. 
  As for Bratislava's desire to include a Slovak judge on the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague, Laszlo Valki said 
that this request is justified and can be implemented almost 
automatically. 
  According to the rules, if the sides in question do not have 
their own judges in this 15-member international body, they have 
the right to appoint ad-hoc judges themselves, judges who are 
either citizens of the countries in question or third country 
citizens. Given the fact that there has been a Hungarian member 
in this international body since last year, namely Geza Herczeg, 
Hungary cannot appoint another judge. Slovakia, however, can do 
so, but only for this affair and only for the duration of court 
proceedings connected with the Bos issue. His authority will be 
the same as that of the other judges, and his activity will be 
financed by the United Nations.

  [Text] During the talks between Carl-Dieter Spranger, 
German minister for economic cooperation, who is paying a visit 
to our country at the invitation of the Romanian Government, and 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, the sides approached 
aspects of the current stage of bilateral relations with 
emphasis on the support that Germany is ready to grant to 
accelerate the reform processes in Romania. 
  The Romanian side stressed the importance it attaches to 
developing privileged relations with Germany and showed 
gratitude for the support that this country granted Romania 
within the European Union and the G-24 in financial and economic 
areas, as well as for the support granted to German ethnic 
communities in Romania. 
  According to information from our correspondent Doina 
Saiciuc, the German guest stressed that the governmental 
framework accord on technical cooperation between Romania and 
Germany that he will sign with Romanian Minister of Finance 
Florin Georgescu is the first of this kind with a country in 
Central and Eastern Europe. One wishes to intensify the support 
granted by Germany to Romania to enable Romania to overcome the 
difficulties of transition and accelerate the passage to the 
market economy. 
  Spranger conveyed the German Government's wish to intensify 
cooperation with Romania in various areas and remarked on the 
increasing importance that the German Government grants to 
relations with our country. The guest referred to the visits 
that the German minister of defense and the federal foreign 
minister plan to make to Bucharest in the near future. 
  In connection with some opinions that have been circulated 
lately which reintroduce the idea of differentiation of 
treatment applied to associated states in Central Europe and 
which imply discrimination against Romania, the German minister 
mentioned that the integration into the European Union of 
associated countries should take into account economic 
performance criteria and not criteria regarding their 
association with one group or another. 
  In a statement after his talks with the Romanian foreign 
minister, Spranger stated that his visit to Romania is an 
expression of the importance that Germany gives to relations 
with our country and of the wish to further expand these 
relations. Referring to the visit he is going to make to 
projects achieved within the framework of Romanian-German 
cooperation program in Sibiu and Arad, where he will hold talks 
with representatives of the local authorities and of the German 
minority, Spranger noted that discussions will not focus only on 
German minority issues but will also take into account the 
interests of Romania in general. 
  A short while ago our correspondent accredited to the 
government informed us that a technical cooperation accord was 
signed at Victoria Palace between the Romanian and German 
Governments. The accord establishes the unfolding of 
nonrefundable economic assistance granted by Germany to our 
country. The volume of this assistance is about 250 million 
German marks. The document was signed by Spranger and Mircea 
Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council for 
Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform.

<F P=106> ["ul" report: "Iliescu: Discriminatory Measures Against </F>
Romanian Germans"] 
  [Text] Bucharest, 5 May -- Romanian President Iliescu has 
admitted that the German minority in Romania was subjected to 
"discriminatory measures" in the years of communism. However, 
in talking to this newspaper he chose a formulation that does 
not correspond to what the leadership of the "Democratic Forum 
of Germans in Romania" (DFDR) expects of him. Iliescu said that 
there were "delicate moments" in Romania after World War II. 
Germans and Romania got into "difficulties" at that time. Many 
were deported or expropriated. The current Romanian leadership 
rejects "these discriminatory measures." Iliescu added that, 
since the end of the dictatorship, Germans are no longer being 
discriminated in Romania. The current difficulties of the 
country are general and affect all nationalities. Anyone who 
emigrates today does that mainly for material reasons and not 
because Germans are discriminated against in Romania. In 
Romania politicians of both the parties close to the government 
and the opposition keep repeating how much the country regrets 
the emigration of the German minority. 
  DFDR Chairman Philippi called Iliescu's comments on the 
deportations and expropriations of the postwar period "too 
general." According to him, Romanian Germans can regain trust in 
their state only if, apart from the injustices under which all 
citizens suffered, Iliescu also recognizes those that were 
imposed on the Germans in particular. Philippi says he expects 
Iliescu to "solemnly" recognize the excesses of the state 
against the German ethnic group -- similar to what Czech 
President Havel did in the past. In January 1945, about 70,000 
Romanian Germans were arrested by Romanian police and Romanian 
military and extradited to the Soviet Union for years of forced 
labor. More than 10,000 died during the transports and in the 
Soviet labor camps. The Romanian Germans also accuse the 
Romanian state of having carried out general expropriations at 
the beginning of the communist dictatorship, which hit the 
German minority particularly hard. 
  Germany supports the demand of the DFDR that Romania should 
officially recognize the discrimination. Horst Waffenschmidt 
(Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in 
the Interior Ministry and the Federal Government's commissioner 
for resettlers, who is currently visiting the Romanian capital 
and the most important settlement areas of the Romanian Germans, 
broached the desire for an official statement during a meeting 
with Iliescu in the president's palace of Cotroceni in 
Bucharest. After the meeting Iliescu commented on this by 
saying that the desires of the Romanian Germans exclusively 
affect the relationship of the Romanian state with its citizens. 
  Waffenschmidt pointed out to Iliescu that Germany has spent 
more than 111 million German marks [DM] since 1990 to help the 
Germans in Romania. In 1994, another DM11 million are supposed 
to be spent for this purpose. This help also benefits the 
"neighboring surroundings" of the Germans in Romania. The 
Federal Government wants to contribute to having Germans and 
Romanians coexist peacefully. However, it is expected that 
Romania abolish the customs duties that are currently levied on 
German relief supplies. In addition, television must transmit 
more German broadcasts. After the meeting, Iliescu announced 
that the Romanian Government will reexamine the customs 
regulations.

<F P=106> ["Protest" signed by Timisoara Mayor Viorel Oancea] </F>
  [Text] In connection with the invitation to Their 
Majesties King Mihai I and Queen Ana to spend the Holy Easter 
Holidays together with Timisoara citizens, we wish to make 
public our protest at the Government's attitude, which lacks all 
respect for the martyr-town Timisoara and its legally 
established authorities. 
  Striking again at the dignity of the legally elected local 
authorities and violating once again the laws of this country's 
Parliament -- above all the law on local administration, 
according to which the local authority is invested with autonomy 
in decision-making and local representation of the state 
institutions -- the Romanian Government, by dragging out the 
issue and setting almost absurd conditions for granting an entry 
visa to His Majesty King Mihai I as a private person, has not 
only expressed a position full of contempt for the monarchic 
institutions but also violated one of the main rights of every 
citizen, namely the right to visit his own country. The major 
reason for of this unqualifiable attitude is the current 
leadership's legitimacy complex. 
  This is new proof that Timisoara, the symbol of democracy 
and 
of a civilized attitude toward the world and its development, 
represents for those in power a source of fear, an area that 
generates anxiety compared with the sweet comfort of their own 
position. 
  Dear Timisoara citizens, they have not forgiven us for the 
fact that the wave that overthrew the entire order to which the 
current leaders are still devoted started here. 
  We do not wish to damage the status of this town, and so we 
defy this attitude of the government that is detrimental to 
Timisoara's reputation! 
  Expressing my deepest regret at the government's attitude 
and 
convinced that their Majesties Mihai I and Queen Ana will not 
extend their sorrow at this reaction of frightful reserve to us, 
I nurture the hope that the time will come when the bells of the 
Metropolitan Cathedral in Timisoara will chime to welcome its 
founder, Mihai I of Romania. 
  God bless us all! 
  Viorel Oancea, mayor of Timisoara

<F P=106> [Report by Vlad Pufu: "General Suceava Resigned From the </F>
Customs Directorate"] 
  [Text] Sources at the Ministry of Finance have revealed to 
our reporters that on 29 April Reserve General Ioan Suceava 
stepped down from his office as deputy general director of the 
General Customs Directorate and chief of the Directorate for 
Customs Checking and Supervision. 
  In his resignation, which was addressed to Finance Minister 
Florin Georgescu, General Suceava requested "the termination of 
my employment beginning 15 April, on the basis of Article 29." 
  The recent conflict that broke out between the Ministry of 
Interior and the General Customs Directorate is gaining 
momentum. On 25 April Mihai Panzariu, general director of the 
General Customs Directorate, advised General Suceava that he 
should hand in his resignation before 1 May, our sources said. 
  "Mihai Panzariu has begun to purge his backyard of spies. As 
you may know, the relations between the two were not exactly 
amiable. It seems that now they managed to reveal some 
irregularities by General Suceava, so that they could offer him 
this solution as a more elegant way to leave his office," the 
same sources asserted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Julius </F>
Gembicky; place and date not given: "The Aim Was Not To Bring 
About My Dismissal But To Besmirch Me"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- The extraordinary 31st meeting of 
Parliament started after midnight, that is, actually, on 
Thursday [5 May]. The sole point on the agenda was a motion by 
a group of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] deputies 
that Roman Kovac be recalled from the post of deputy prime 
minister. The 100 minutes of a pitiful debate without any 
conclusive arguments in support of the accusations were 
concluded by a vote. The first attempt to wipe out the 
coalition government minister by minister did not come off. 
  [Gembicky] Deputy prime minister, did you have any idea 
about the specific contents of the accusations? 
  [Kovac] We have known about the HZDS tactics to propose 
dismissals of government members for about three weeks. They 
were laid down by Vladimir Meciar in the HZDS Club of Deputies. 
In line with these tactics, at every plenary meeting of 
Parliament they will come up with at least one motion to recall 
a member of the coalition government. I do not know whether I 
should consider it an honor that I was chosen as the first 
target. We did expect, however, that one of the former 
collaborators, who have now automatically become the biggest 
enemies for the HZDS, would be chosen first. I knew very little 
about the accusations cited in the motion -- that they concerned 
the inability to cope with the post of deputy prime minister, a 
suspected attempt at corruption, and a flawed moral profile. 
That was all I knew. 
  [Gembicky] But already at that time reports were leaked from 
HZDS lobbies that the matter supposedly concerned an order for 
Siemens medical appliances.... 
  [Kovac] The problem is that not a single specific accusation 
was raised by HZDS deputies in Parliament. They only wanted to 
discredit me in the eyes of the public. They will never prove 
what they accused me of. I knew that the proposal to recall me 
would be put forward by Mr. Masiar. His speech was followed by 
statements by a group of female HZDS deputies. That came as a 
surprise to me, and so did the statement by deputy J. Rea, who 
is a deeply religious man. While working at the Government 
Office, we used to go to the chapel for services together. It 
took my breath away that he, as a Christian, lowered himself and 
put his signature to such a heap of lies. The paradoxical thing 
is that I was hardly involved in the whole Siemens case. I met 
the firm's representatives only when they presented their offer 
to extend a loan to Slovakia. I was unable to assess how 
advantageous the terms of the loan were, which is why I invited 
Finance Minister Julius Toth, who was to assess the quality and 
specifications of the loan, as well as Health Minister Viliam 
Sobona to attend the talks. That was my first and last meeting 
with Siemens representatives. Ultimately, the agreement was 
signed by Viliam Sobona and handed over to Siemens by Vladimir 
Meciar. 
  [Gembicky] Your signature did not figure under the 
agreement? 
  [Kovac] No. And I was not invited to any subsequent talks. 
I came across the offer from Siemens once more when this 
material was submitted to a meeting of the cabinet that I 
happened to chair. It is remarkable that, originally, it had 
been submitted to the government as a financial credit but the 
Slovak National Bank governor objected that it was not a 
financial credit but a supplier's credit. Besides, the material 
had not been supplemented with any mention of a competitive 
tender. There were also objections to the repayment timetable, 
which is why we withdraw the item from the agenda. That was all. 
  [Gembicky] On Wednesday [4 May] evening, speaking at the Na 
Pasienkoch indoor stadium, former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
also accused you of having embezzled $5 million earmarked for 
media policy.... 
  [Kovac] Deputy J. Rea, too, reiterated this absurdity later 
that night. The sum of $5 million is an enormous one. It is 
not customary to give sums of this magnitude as a bribe. I 
would never be able to accept such money and, if I could, then 
only for state coffers to subsidize much needed and 
loss-generating periodicals, such as children's periodicals. 
  [Gembicky] You supposedly brought it up at a government 
meeting? 
  [Kovac] I beg your pardon, if someone wanted to collect such 
a sum in dollars, would he bring it up at a government meeting? 
This is ludicrous.... 
  [Gembicky] But supposedly there are witnesses.... 
  [Kovac] When J. Rea uttered these accusations, not a single 
former member of the government -- three of whom were present -- 
got up and said that this was true. 
  [Gembicky] One cannot seek redress in court against 
something that was said in Parliament. What about the things 
that were said at the rally at Na Pasienkoch? 
  [Kovac] I must get hold of the exact transcript of the 
rally. Then I will decide whether to seek redress in court. I 
believe, however, that the HZDS will be sued by Siemens, which 
has been accused of being a corrupt firm. 
  [Gembicky] How did your coalition partners respond to the 
accusations? 
  [Kovac] The aim was absolutely clear to everyone. I 
appreciate their statements. 
  [Gembicky] In what way did you fail to cope with the post of 
deputy prime minister, according to the motion? 
  [Kovac] I supposedly did not cope with the management of 
ministries. However, I was only supposed to coordinate their 
activity. Furthermore, I supposedly bear my share of 
responsibility for the catastrophic situation in the health 
services. But I did not run the ministry. Quite the contrary, 
I beseeched Vladimir Meciar not to recommend Viliam Sobona for 
that post and asked him five times to recall him from it. 
Deputy Meciar denied this, even though witnesses were present. 
They also blame me for having established an advisory 
commission to analyze the situation in the health services. My 
third sin concerns the dispute between [former Health Minister] 
Sobona and [former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs] 
Keltosova over the concept of the National Insurance Company. I 
have also been accused of failure to cope with the tripartite 
council, even though I succeeded in maintaining social peace in 
a complicated situation when unpopular measures had to be taken. 
Nor did I obstruct the signing of the general agreement 
[between government, employers, and trade unions]. It was 
[Finance Minister] Julius Toth who vetoed the acceptance of the 
social fund. Trade unionists could confirm my words. At night, 
after recalling me from the government, they sent a car to 
Piestany to fetch [chairman of the Confederation of Trade 
Unions] Alojz Englis and [chairman of the Employers' 
Association] Mr. Lach in order to sign the general agreement 
early in the morning, after an unnecessary delay of six weeks. 
It was necessary to prove that things work better without Kovac. 
  [Gembicky] And what about the moral accusation that, by your 
personal approach, you stood in the way of an HZDS-Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] coalition? 
  [Kovac] This coalition had been blocked by a decision of the 
HZDS national leadership, not by me. Some HZDS deputy even 
accused me of having actually changed the history of Slovakia. 
The best reply to this accusation was given by [SDL Chairman] 
Peter Weiss. 
  [Gembicky] What affected you most strongly about the 
accusations raised by your former colleagues from the HZDS? 
  [Kovac] I am grateful to those people from the HZDS who 
refused to sign the motion that I be recalled. However, some of 
the 35 names [that signed the motion] did surprise me. 
  [Gembicky] Could you be more specific? 
  [Kovac] Yes. I was surprised by the readiness of deputies 
Aibekova, Valcekova, and Romanovska to put their signatures to 
the motion.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 
4 May on page 1 publishes a 300-word statement issued by the 
Standing Conference of the Civic Institute (SKOI) in response to 
the offer advanced by the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) to 
"right-wing groupings and personalities with similar political 
views" to participate in the forthcoming parliamentary elections 
on the KDH slate of candidates. The KDH offer, and unification 
of Slovak right-wing parties in general, are also the subject of 
an 800-word interview with Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the 
National Democratic Party (NDS)-New Alternative, by Alena 
Gottweisova in Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 4 May on 
page 2. The interview, the place and date of which are not 
given, is published under the headline "Options of a Joint 
Course of Action." 
  The SKOI statement welcomes the KDH offer as an opportunity 
to unite "civic and Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." It 
states: "We receive with satisfaction the KDH's opening toward 
civic democratic forces, which we understand as a historic step 
toward overcoming mutual differences and toward the actual 
amalgamation of Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." 
Referring to the fragmentation of the right-wing vote in the 
1992 elections, the SKOI statement proclaims that "the mistakes 
of the year 1992 must not be repeated" and calls on "all civic 
democratic forces that want to share in the KDH's and SKOI's 
common work to follow our path of unification of civic and 
Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." 
  Cernak's reaction to the KDH offer is more reserved. The 
relevant passage in the SLOVENSKY DENNIK interview reads: 
  [Gottweisova] ``The unification of right-wing forces is the 
topic of the day. Representatives of the KDH, Democratic Party 
(DS), the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS), the Party of 
Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, and the NDS have agreed to 
cooperate. One option foresees the formation of a single entity, 
the other option is represented by KDH's offer to reserve places 
for representatives of other parties on its own slate of 
candidates. Which option is more promising, in your opinion?'' 
  [Cernak] "It is premature to say which option would be 
better. During the meeting of parties of the right center we 
noted that all of them are interested in cooperation. 
Unfortunately, some subsequent statements did not quite confirm 
this readiness. The KDH has put forward its idea, I and my 
party colleagues will prepare other possible alternatives. We 
have to realize that we would suffer terrible defeat in the eyes 
of the Slovak public if we kept meeting for two months, kept 
proclaiming that we want to cooperate, and, ultimately, failed 
to agree on the form of this cooperation. That would be the 
worst possible alternative. Creating a single entity is 
unrealistic, however, in my opinion because, in view of 
differences in programs, the liberally oriented DEUS cannot 
merge with the KDH. We can proceed jointly in a coalition bloc 
or establish a grouping within the framework of the center and 
right center. I am an advocate of joint course of action by the 
widest possible current, which is why I would prefer the 
formation of a coalition bloc, within the framework of which 
those five entities, plus, possibly, a sixth one, would nominate 
their candidates. We would be able to expect a relatively good 
result in that case. The voter can, moreover, influence the 
result by means of preferential votes. I would therefore 
accept, for example, a procedure with a single slate of 
candidates whereby, in the event of electoral success, he who 
gets the largest number of preferential votes would form the 
government. This option does not seem to be feasible, however, 
in view of certain antagonisms existing among individual 
parties." Asked about the "sixth potential partner," Cernak 
says that he was thinking of the Christian Social Union (KSU), 
which has reportedly abandoned the idea of cooperating with the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and "has left the door open 
for talks with other political entities." Cernak concedes, 
however, that the presence of the KSU in such a right-wing bloc 
might deter some potential right-wing voters.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak 
on 3 May on page 10, under the headline "New `Lessons From the 
Crisis-Ridden Development,'" carries a 4,500-word paper signed 
by Augustin Marian Huska, deputy chairman of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), which analyzes the "ten most serious 
mistakes" in the HZDS's activity. The text is preceded by an 
introductory passage, which notes: "Materials of unclear and 
even dubious origin appear on our editorial desk from time to 
time. The one that we submit to you today carries the 
type-written signature of A.M. Huska, the architect of HZDS 
ideology. The style and ideas really indicate his authorship, or 
the authorship of someone who is his brilliant imitator." 
  In the text itself, the author identifies the following "ten 
most serious mistakes" in the HZDS's activity -- underestimation 
of the influence of foreign interests in Slovakia; insufficient 
personnel work; priority given to "tactical improvisation over 
strategic concepts"; failure to tap the intellectual potential 
of the so-called HZDS professional clubs; complacency of the 
HZDS apparatus; failure to show that HZDS policies "follow up on 
the spiritual and cultural traditions of the nation"; 
ineffective cooperation with academics and researchers; lack of 
team work; failure to activate the young generation; and poor 
cooperation with the media. 
  Speaking about the first point, the author says: "The 
complex 
geopolitical situation and the power vacuum in Central Europe 
have activated neighboring countries and the centers of world 
influence to assert their selfish interests. The manipulatory 
circles became active particularly when they discovered that 
Meciar's government wanted to consistently protect Slovak state 
interests. A power struggle is at play, designed to secure the 
dominance of foreign interests in the republic and testing 
citizens' resilience to this influence. The aim of these 
foreign interests is a weak government (that is, one that is 
`cooperative' and ready for `compromise'). It is necessary to 
get to know the foreign interests' lines of force and find 
abroad allies for preserving Slovakia's sovereignty. It is 
necessary to make use of the contradictory nature of foreign 
interests in order to mutually neutralize them. It is necessary 
to systematically explain the danger arising from domestic 
circles' links with these foreign interests. It is necessary to 
expose the opportunistic two-facedness of domestic political 
forces that profit in a parasitical way from the identity 
between their own and foreign interests. It is necessary to 
launch extensive propaganda so that the state interests of 
Slovakia become the framework for assessing the legitimacy of 
all other interests operating here." 
  In Huska's opinion, the "foreign forces" make use of the 
doctrine of "cosmopolitism" as an "instrument to enforce their 
own dominance" and promote the "so-called civic society with the 
aim of halting the process of emancipation in Slovakia."

drafted by the Ministry of Privatization. 
  This, which testifies to the slowing down of the pace of 
privatization, has also prompted the present government to 
incorporate into its Policy Statement the preparation of the 
second wave of coupon privatization. For the sake of 
comparison, the offer for the first wave of coupon privatization 
consisted of more than 500 shareholding companies. 
  The Ministry of Privatization report proposes that the 
registration of citizens and investment privatization funds take 
place from 1 September to 31 October 1994, the processing and 
assessment of registrations from 1 to 7 November 1994, the 
preliminary round -- the subscribing of points to investment 
privatization funds -- from 3 October to 16 December 1994, and 
the presentation of the list of shareholders and investment 
privatization funds from 19 December to 30 December 1994. 
  Preliminary dates of individual rounds for placing orders: 
  First Round: 2-25 January 1995 
  Second Round: 6-17 February 1995 
  Third Round: 6-17 March 1995 
  Fourth Round: 3-14 April 1995 
  Fifth Round: 2-12 May 1995 
  As the report states, the Ministry of Privatization has 
drawn 
up a preliminary list of property offered for the second wave of 
coupon privatization. Included in the list are 104 industrial 
enterprises with an aggregate book value of 152.9 billion Slovak 
korunas [Sk], of which Sk72.5 billion (47 percent) is earmarked 
for privatization by means of coupons; 43 agricultural 
enterprises with an aggregate book value of Sk10.6 billion, of 
which Sk4.8 billion (47 percent) is earmarked for coupon 
privatization; and 36 enterprises from the branches of 
transportation, tourism, retailing, and services with an 
aggregate value of Sk19.4 billion, of which Sk7.6 billion (39 
percent) is earmarked for coupon privatization. In addition, 
some of the "unsold" shares from the first wave of coupon 
privatization, which are currently in the portfolio of the 
National Property Fund of the Slovak Republic, as well as shares 
which the National Property Fund acquired within the framework 
of increases in shareholding companies' capital stock for reason 
of reassessment of real estate value, should also be offered to 
coupon holders within the second wave of coupon privatization. 
"All together, it is thus possible to offer Sk100 to Sk105 
billion worth of property within the second wave of coupon 
privatization," the report states. The Ministry of 
Privatization has recently intensified the preparatory work for 
the second wave of coupon privatization. A part of the 
ministry's staff is working at an outlying workplace out of 
Bratislava lest the increased work intensity be disrupted by the 
routine agenda and by dealing with inquiries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Vladimir </F>
Popelka; place and date not given: "The Payments Agreement Needs 
To Be Changed"] 
  [Text] [Popelka] According to some reports, you are 
supposed to meet with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. Klaus, 
however, sees no reason for such a meeting to take place. Do 
you see a reason for it? 
  [Moravcik] I agree with the Czech prime minister on this 
point. A meeting of the prime ministers becomes important when 
experts, ministers, or deputy prime ministers are unable to 
clarify contentious issues. Our meeting would have to concern a 
wider range of issues. We are not in a situation where we would 
feel that such a meeting is necessary. 
  [Popelka] Is the situation surrounding the so-called old 
clearing account not a reason for such a meeting to take place, 
as recently suggested by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita 
Schmognerova? 
  [Moravcik] Not all possibilities of bilateral negotiations 
have been exhausted in this case. Some new aspects have 
surfaced. The problem is that the basic payments agreement was 
disadvantageous for Slovakia. The agreement on payments for the 
old clearing account provides for compensation for the 
difference in the exchange rates [of the Czech and Slovak 
korunas] from the state budget. This is a burden on the Slovak 
state budget. While negotiating the agreement, the Slovak side 
apparently did not calculate bilateral claims well enough and 
did not realize that we are worse off than the Czechs. This is 
why we came up with the idea of abolishing the old clearing 
account. The true gist of the problem, in my opinion, is that 
the payments agreement needs to be changed, but the Czechs are 
not interested in this because the present state suits them. 
  [Popelka] The opposition has repeatedly referred to you in 
connection with the club of the "Leninist spark." What kind of 
a club is this, in fact? 
  [Moravcik] It was set up after we gained the impression that 
the thinking represented by Mikhail Gorbachev was not applied in 
Slovakia. The club's task was to bring together people who 
realized the need for more radical changes. The name "Leninist 
spark" was only a camouflage designed to hoodwink the StB [State 
Security Corps]. The organizers are registered in StB files 
because later they were rated as candidates for the criminal act 
of sedition.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Bakovsky: "Army Admits Shortcomings </F>
Ascertained by Supreme Inspection Office"] 
  [Text] The Army does not intend to call in question the 
results of an inquiry by the Supreme Inspection Office [NKU], 
which uncovered serious systemic shortcomings in the management 
of surplus and otherwise unusable Army material. The Ministry 
of Defense Press Department confirmed this to our daily. 
  The inquiry, which focused on the 1990-93 period, 
ascertained 
numerous violations of laws, decrees, and legal regulations. 
The final NKU report refers to systemic shortcomings appearing, 
in particular, in the years 1990-92. For example, the Army 
unlawfully sold the Struzna, Kanice, and Neznasov chateaux, 
which are registered as historical monuments, although it was 
under an obligation to offer them to the state before selling 
them. 
  The Ministry of Defense confirmed that the data contained in 
the NKU report conforms with reality. According to the 
ministry's Press Department, "the NKU officials' specific 
findings cannot be called in question." The Press Department 
statement notes that, after assuming office, Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys arrived at the same results, which is why he 
banned all property transfers until a new system of management 
with surplus property is worked out. According to the ministry, 
the new system is transparent, easily verifiable, and fully in 
accordance with valid laws. 
  All officials responsible for violations of legal norms had 
without exception been recalled from their posts, according to 
Ministry of Defense data. Antonin Baudys also asked the Chief 
Military Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether criminal 
offenses had been committed when transferring the Army's real 
estate to other persons. The Chief Military Prosecutor's Office 
stated, however, that the facts that have been ascertained are 
not sufficient to warrant criminal proceedings. The Military 
Police has therefore been charged with investigating the matter 
further. The results of its efforts thus far have been negative, 
however, according to the Ministry of Defense Press Department.

<F P=106> ["(jis)"-signed report: "Minister Baudys Has Approved the </F>
Supreme Inspection Office's Report"] 
  [Text] Prague -- "I agree with the report of the Supreme 
Inspection Office [NKU] and I consider it to be quite correct," 
said Defense Minister Antonin Baudys apropos the NKU report on 
economic management in the Czech Army. 
  It is apparent from the report that the regulations on the 
protection of state property were violated in the years 1990-92. 
The minister said that, when he took up his post, he halted the 
transfer of all property until new mechanisms were approved for 
the sale of real estate and chattels and that all the 
functionaries responsible for violating the regulations had been 
discharged. At the same time, he suggested to the main Military 
Prosecutor's Office that it consider whether any crimes had been 
committed. It released a statement in which it said that the 
findings were not sufficient to justify suspicion of criminal 
activity. Last week, the government approved material on the 
sale of real estate with the proviso that state administration 
bodies be given the option of having it transferred to them free 
of charge. Other property will be sold at auction by real 
estate agencies or will be exchanged for apartments. Special 
materials, such as weapons and munition, will be sold to 
interested parties who hold a special license for trading in 
these goods.

<F P=106> ["lic"-signed report: "Unlike Klaus Kinkel, Czech Diplomacy </F>
Regards the Sudeten German Issue as Closed"] 
  [Text] Prague -- According to Michal Lobkowicz, senior 
director of the cabinet [vrchni reditel kabinetu] of the Czech 
minister of foreign affairs, the leadership of Czech foreign 
policy regards the issue of Sudeten Germans as closed. 
Lobkowicz thus reacted indirectly to German Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Klaus Kinkel's statement of Wednesday [4 May], in which 
he called the issue of the deported Germans' freedom to settle 
and property rights an "unsolved and open" problem in relations 
between the two countries. 
  According to some sources, Kinkel's statement is proof that 
Bonn wants to discuss the Sudeten German issue at government 
level. "The Czech Republic regards the issue of the Sudeten 
Germans as closed. This is not some optimistic assertion, it is 
our position," Michal Lobkowicz stated literally. 
  "I do not consider it highly probable that the German side 
would wish to reopen the Sudeten German problem," he added. The 
senior director of the cabinet of the minister of foreign 
affairs refused to specifically comment on Kinkel's statement on 
the ground that he had not yet received its exact wording. 
"However, the Ministry has already taken steps to obtain more 
detailed information about the whole matter. This information 
should become available within the next few hours or days," 
Lobkowicz went on to say. At a meeting on Thursday [5 May] with 
a group of politicians from the Bundestag group of the ruling 
Christian CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union] parties who represent expellees' organizations, Minister 
Kinkel said, furthermore, that the Federal Government would 
continue to stand up for the interests of Germans who had been 
expelled from eastern countries after the war. It will also do 
everything it can to support the interests of those afflicted 
and to bring about an interstate dialogue on this problem. At 
the same time, however, Kinkel said that Germany's foremost task 
in relation to its eastern neighbors was to support and assist 
in the reforms and in stabilizing the situation in those 
countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F>
Krejci; place and date not given: "Exception Made With Regard to 
Jewish Property Cannot Be Repeated"] 
  [Text] [Krejci] Why did the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] 
back away from its position regarding the restitution of 
property to Jewish physical persons and why did it allow that 
communities be designated by law as dutiful persons [povinne 
osoby], that is, those obliged to hand out property? After all, 
it was clearly to be expected that the coalition partners would 
use this as a precedent during the discussion on the restitution 
of church property, which is exactly what has happened. Will it 
not be difficult to explain, and defend, that a principle that 
applies to one type of property does not apply to another type, 
that is, to church property? 
  [Klaus] I and, I think, also the overwhelming majority of 
ODS members consider the exception made with regard to Jewish 
property not repeatable, singular, and unique. This exception 
is due to the quite extraordinary suffering of citizens of 
Jewish origin during World War II. It does not mean any 
precedent, however, and nothing of this sort can be repeated. 
  [Krejci] The ODS is preparing a specific proposal for a 
complete stop after restitutions. What will it look like and on 
what will it be based? 
  [Klaus] The ODS Executive Council will deal with a complete 
stop after restitutions this weekend and I hope that we will 
make progress on this issue. It is precisely the variant of the 
restitution of Jewish property that was approved by Parliament 
last week that is causing the ODS to speed up the work on the 
proposal for a complete stop on restitution. 
  [Krejci] The treaty on Palestinian autonomy has been signed. 
On the one hand, there is the view that this process is really 
leading toward peace in the region. On the other hand, 
according to other voices, this is the beginning of new 
conflicts with a potentially very tragic ending. What is your 
opinion? 
  [Klaus] Such matters as this are very difficult to assess 
from the outside. Czechoslovakia's partition is the best 
example of that. We knew at that moment that partition was 
unavoidable. I can exceptionally agree with [Deputy Foreign 
Minister] Mr. Bratinka that it was a contribution toward calm 
and peace in Europe. I remember well, however, that assessments 
from the outside were quite different. Therefore, I really 
would not dare predict whether this step, that is, the formation 
of Palestinian autonomy, will contribute to internal peace 
between Jews and Arabs and I believe that no one else should 
dare make that judgment. 
  During my visit to Israel I spoke with Prime Minister Rabin 
and Foreign Minister Peres, both of whom were pinning all their 
hopes on this step. Those familiar with their past know that 
the two had not always been such dovish characters, wanting to 
make peace at any price. They had often sided with advocates of 
a more vigorous solution to this issue. I believe, however, 
that they have now arrived at a mature and balanced conclusion. 
  There can be no doubt that the signing of the agreement on 
Palestinian autonomy will not bring peace overnight. In the 
short run, unrest in these territories could even grow stronger 
and the very first hours already suggest that this may very well 
be the case. I do not think, however, that there is any other 
path toward peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jerzy Milewski, secretary of state a the </F>
Ministry of Defense, by Janusz B. Grochowski; place and date not 
given: "We Play Seriously"] 
  [Excerpts] [Grochowski] The Ministry of National Defense 
[MON] and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs very quickly prepared 
the presentation document for the "Partnership for Peace" 
program; it was then submitted to NATO representatives in 
Brussels. You did not hesitate to call this a great success. 
  [Milewski] Perhaps this is too great a word. However, we 
certainly achieved another very important stage in the 
implementation of our strategic intention, which, invariably and 
regardless of the activities of other states, is Poland's 
integration with the NATO structures. We look upon the 
"Partnership for Peace" program as a way of accelerating the 
achievement of this goal. 
  I do not claim that Poland should achieve the status of a 
regular NATO member immediately. On the contrary; I believe 
that this would be rather risky for us. It would be more 
advisable to employ appropriate procedures for gradually 
admitting new members to NATO -- starting with the political 
sphere, then the sphere of defense planning, and finally, there 
would be full military integration for which our Army would then 
be well-prepared. If we joined this organization without proper 
preparations, the "old" members might consider us as a not fully 
credible partner; this would deprive us of equal influence on 
the shaping of the NATO policy. [passage omitted] 
  [Grochowski] What are we going to do, then, in order to 
ensure democratic control over the Army? 
  [Milewski] It is certainly not enough to merely declare it. 
Mechanisms must be created that will make it fully possible for 
the parliament, for the government, as well as for the 
president, who is the commander in chief of the Army, to bear 
real responsibility for the Army, which is written in the Small 
Constitution. In particular, the National Security Council must 
be given appropriate powers. It is also necessary to define 
unequivocally the degree and the kind of subordination of the 
command over the Polish Army to the civilian minister of 
national defense. 
  [Grochowski] In other words, this is an announcement of 
legislative changes. 
  [Milewski] Not only legislative, but also organizational 
changes and changes concerning internal regulations. For a long 
time now we have been pointing to the need for legislative 
changes concerning not only the functioning of the Army, but 
also other elements of the state defense system. Among other 
things, we lack legislation on the Martial Law and we also need 
to thoroughly amend the law on the state of emergency. The old 
legal acts come from the period of the Martial Law -- the early 
1980's -- and they are absolutely unfit to be applied today. 
They were supposed to make it possible for the authorities at 
the time to fight with the anticommunist political opposition; 
however, only to a very small degree do they create conditions 
to counter local conflicts near our borders or ecological 
threats, natural calamities, or mass influxes of immigrants. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Grochowski] Poland declares readiness for greater 
cooperation with the units of the NATO states during 
peacekeeping missions. Does this mean an increase in our 
involvement in these operations? 
  [Milewski] Currently, nearly 2,000 Polish officers and 
soldiers are participating in these missions abroad, half of 
them in former Yugoslavia. We would be prepared to carry out 
the request of the UN secretariat and increase these 
contingents; however, MON cannot afford this. Even though the 
UN reimburses the expenses for taking part in the missions, it 
does it after some time, which the secretariat justifies as 
Poland's overdue membership subscription fees. 
  [Grochowski] Still, we envision the establishment of a 
1,000-person operational battalion, capable of a fast response. 
  [Milewski] It will be stationed in Poland and, if need be, 
it would be ready to take part in a NATO mission outside the 
country. We could prepare such a battalion within a year. The 
problem is that all of its members must be volunteers and must 
know at least basic English. These are rather difficult 
conditions; however, we hope that the experience that we gain 
will be able to be taken advantage of in the restructurization 
of other units. Eventually, the entire Army, as well as its 
various units and formations, should be able to act under 
international control within the framework of the joint forces 
of NATO. One of the conditions for achieving this goal is as 
follows: Our military commanders should denounce trends aimed at 
rendering the Polish Army structures more autonomous. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] With the participation of Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak the government is holding its proceedings in Lansk. The 
main subject of the two-day meeting is a socioeconomic program 
for Poland for the next three years. Before flying to Lansk, 
the prime minister said: We have decided to hold this meeting 
out of town, so that everyday problems do not affect a calm 
exchange of views. 
  [Begin recording] [Pawlak] The purpose of this meeting, 
today 
and tomorrow, is to discuss the fundamental components of 
strategy for Poland. We want to do this in a peaceful 
atmosphere, so that everyday pressures do not interfere with our 
examination of these long-term processes. I think that, as a 
result of the circumstances and the situation, Poland has 
tremendous opportunities to become a country that counts and is 
significant in the east-central region of Europe, and we want to 
seek action opportunities that will make it possible to realize 
this objective. 
  [Correspondent Koziol] Mr. Prime Minister, will the current 
situation in the country, which is so heated, also be a subject 
of discussion at Lansk? 
  [Pawlak] We intend to focus on long-term issues. As far as 
immediate issues are concerned, as you very well know, ladies 
and gentlemen, Minister Miller and Minister Pol have been 
speaking about this. I think we should leave them room for 
maneuver here. [end recording] 
  Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance 
minister, 
who accompanied the prime minister on his way to Lansk, 
emphasized the need to extend the perspective within which the 
government is going to pursue its economic policy. Often this 
perspective gets shortened under pressure from severe social 
problems, Grzegorz Kolodko added. 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] The Polish economy has good 
opportunities, and Polish society has good prospects, also as 
far as increased income is concerned. Admittedly we would like 
most of this income growth to be directed toward investment, 
with future generations, with the future in mind. 
  The main line of this strategy is stable growth, with a 
fairer division of the national income than hitherto, but this 
too requires some tidying up of the system, a continuation of 
work started earlier, and the establishment of some kind of 
sequence. That is why we would like to take some time thinking 
about this. 
  It is clear, of course, that we are not going to return from 
Lansk with some sort of final conception of government economic 
policy. In the immediate future its individual elements are 
going to be presented for public evaluation and for 
parliamentary debate. But we do have a conception of this kind 
and I would like to emphasize once again that the Polish economy 
has good prospects. [end recording] 
  Of the three scenarios for Polish economic development 
prepared by the Central Planning Office, the so-called 
fundamental scenario is going to be adopted. Deputy Prime 
Minister Kolodko: 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] Of course we have chosen the 
optimistic scenario, and through our program and our activities, 
together with other social and political forces, we want to 
implement the optimism which follows from this scenario. This 
scenario assumes a fairly significant national income growth, 
and this is going to require appropriate changes in the field of 
public finance and in the field of restructuring the economy, 
including property status changes, and its elements will 
gradually be implemented. This requires a tremendous 
legislative effort and, I repeat, peaceful and hard work, and 
sensible government policy. The government is open to criticism 
and is going to monitor and adjust this conception. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jolanta Koral: "Government Concentrates; </F>
Ministers Debate in Lansk Forest"] 
  [Excerpt] Labor Minister Leszek Miller presented the 
directions of social policy during yesterday's meeting of the 
government in Lansk. 
  As we have learned unofficially, the government debated, 
among other topics, a reform of the labor law and collective 
labor agreements. Let us recall that a corrected version of the 
Labor Law Code was recently submitted to the Sejm by the 
government. The code is said to not regulate too many issues: 
the length of annual leaves, working conditions, and a maximum 
working time, among other things. The remaining issues would be 
settled through collective agreements signed between employers 
and employee representatives. 
  A draft law on collective agreements, which is part of the 
Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, is to be debated by the 
Sejm very soon, as requested by the government. That was a 
demand put forward by "Solidarity" and by other trade unions 
which are negotiating over the "Solidarity" strike demands 
within the trilateral commission. 
<H5>  Tougher Position on Disability Pensions </H5>
  The government most probably also debated reforms of social 
insurance. Work on the reforms has been proceeding without much 
vigor. Ministerial experts met to debate the issue as late as 
27 April. The prime minister has announced that the direction of 
reforms will be announced in June. 
  Among other things, the government intends to tighten the 
criteria for awarding disability pensions, it also intends to 
reform maternity, sick, and family benefits, and to introduce a 
so-called social pension. Persons over 75 years of age would be 
entitled to this kind of pension, and they would also have to be 
illegible for a retirement or other kind of pension; the pension 
would also cover disabled individuals over the age of 18 who are 
completely incapable of working. Principles of awarding social 
rent as well as its size, are currently being negotiated within 
a government-trade union team (without the participation of 
"Solidarity.") 
  Beginning with 1995, a new system for deciding on disability 
would become effective, so as to avoid awarding disability 
pensions to young and healthy people. The new system would 
result in a 10-percent drop in the number of pensions being 
awarded. 
<H5>  Waging a War on Unemployment </H5>
  The Central Planning Administration [CUP] has presented 
"Principles of Socioeconomic Policies for the 1994-97 Period." 
Among other things, those principles provide for the 
introduction of insurance against unemployment beginning in 
1997. But employees would begin paying premiums as early as 
next year. The ratio would be as follows: Employers would pay 
two-thirds of the premium and employees -- the remaining third. 
  For this year, CUP also predicts an increase in the level of 
salaries for budget sector employees by at least 1.5 percent, 
and also a 3.5-increase in retirement and other types of 
pensions. 
  CUP wants to extend Social Insurance Agency premiums to all 
income from work, including contracts for performance of 
specific items and order contracts. Currently, one does not 
have to pay premiums on order contracts signed for fewer than 30 
days and on contracts for performance of a specific item. 
  According to CUP, the government's most important goals in 
the social area are, among other things, to decrease the 
unemployment rate among young people aged 19-24 (estimates are 
that in four years, it will increase by 412,000 people), and 
also increasing the number of jobs through a program to 
construct roads, telecommunication lines, and gas pipelines, as 
well as the development of low-income housing. Financial means 
for an active campaign against unemployment would increase by 22 
percent by 1997 compared with 1993, and would amount to about 
7.5 trillion zlotys. 
<H5>  Valorization and Inflation </H5>
  CUP is in favor of changing the principles of valorization 
of 
retirement and other types of pensions, with the goal of making 
valorization follow price rises instead of the current system, 
where it shadows increases in average salaries. This would 
allow for the real value of benefits to be retained. A change 
in the principles of valorization is one of the strike demands 
put forward by "Solidarity." Other trade unions also support it. 
  Finally, during its session in the Warmie resort, the 
government will deal with protection of forests and a draft law 
on reprivatization and reimbursements. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk: "Politicians Like To Be Silent; </F>
Escape From the Media"] 
  [Text] Political meetings closed to the press are an 
ordinary matter for politicians today. After a short period of 
general openness of the political life, which was, perhaps, only 
during the term of office of the "contract" Sejm, we saw a 
comeback to a secret life. There is usually one rule: The 
opposition meets and discusses matters openly, whereas the 
governing parties hold meetings behind closed doors. 
  The opposition which invites mass media to all its meetings, 
organizes press conferences, and shares information whenever 
journalists want it, stresses in this way that it has nothing to 
hide from the people. This attitude changes radically the 
moment the opposition becomes a governing party. 
<H5>  Through a Ladder to Lansk </H5>
  It should be admitted that as far as avoiding journalists or 
giving evasive answers is concerned, the consecutive governing 
parties display inexhaustible invention. 
  After one of the meetings of the directorate (that is, the 
leadership of the present governing coalition) last autumn, 
journalists learned that the politicians discussed... potato 
harvesting. 
  After submitting his resignation from the post of deputy 
prime minister and finance minister, Marek Borowski entrenched 
himself in his office and it was difficult to "squeeze" a word 
of comment out of him. 
  The ladder that Democratic Left Alliance leader Aleksander 
Kwasniewski used to leave the Sejm premises will probably go 
down in the history of the Polish parliamentary system. 
  Recently sessions of politicians held outside Warsaw have 
been very popular. In a forest it is much easier to hide from 
journalists and all information reach the media with 
considerable delay. It is difficult to say what purpose this is 
supposed to serve -- the information reaches the media sooner or 
later anyway. 
  Perhaps it is the spring that makes the politicians seek 
refuge from the media outside Warsaw. Last Friday in Jablonna 
there was a meeting of the National Council of Radio and 
Television and the leadership of the Polish Television 
(participating in the meeting was, among other persons, Wieslaw 
Walendziak, the Supervisory Board of the Polish Television and 
the Board of Directors, the directors of the First and the 
Second Program, as well as the heads of the regional sections). 
Invited to the meeting was also Government Press Office Head 
Dariusz Jadowski and President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski 
(the latter did not arrive). The meeting was, needless to say, 
closed to the press, even though it was devoted to the 
activities of a component of the mass media -- the television. 
  The government decided to hold a session of the Council of 
Ministers in Lansk. The government building is hidden in a 
forest near a beautiful lake. It is separated from the nearest 
village by kilometers of forests. Behind the doors there are no 
crowds of journalists demanding immediate answers to thousands 
of inquisitive questions. 
<H5>  The Government Point of View </H5>
  Freedom of speech and openness of the political life are 
undoubtedly cumbersome to the participants of this life. The 
openness of the political life is desirable for those who do not 
participate in it, and it serves the purpose of calling those 
who are governing the country at the moment to account. Those 
who are in power do not like to be called to account. They are 
not very favorably disposed toward independent press, because it 
discusses issues that they would willingly conceal. The 
existence of the free press forces the subordinated press to be 
objective -- it cannot omit important information because it 
would lose its readers. Therefore, subordination of the entire 
press is a desired state of affairs for all those who are in 
power. Since this state of affairs is not easy to accomplish, 
politicians are hiding. 
  They say that playing politics far from people's eyes is 
quite common also in countries with rooted democracies. No one 
is surprised by the fact that government spokesmen refuse to 
make any comments. Western parliaments are not visited by large 
groups of journalists, as is the case in our Sejm. 
  On the other hand, however, in deeply rooted democracies no 
one accuses the press of speculating, being aggressive and 
nonobjective, and of pursuing sensational news only, instead of 
showing positive models and printing official communiques when 
they are issued.

<F P=106> [Interview with Internal Affairs Deputy Minister Zbigniew </F>
Sobotka by Aleksander Frydrychowski; place and date not given: 
"Promotion Means Joint Responsibility"] 
  [Excerpt] [Frydrychowicz] First of all congratulations on 
your appointment. What will you deal with in the ministry? 
  [Sobotka] I do not know the specific scope of my powers yet. 
They are supposed to be defined at a joint session of the 
leadership of the ministry, after Minister Milczanowski returns 
to Warsaw -- that is, next week. 
  I know from earlier decisions that my duties will include 
contacts with the parliament, legislation, and perhaps issues 
related to the budget of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]. 
What else -- we will see. 
  [Frydrychowicz] You are the first deputy minister of 
internal affairs appointed on the basis of the coalition's 
"system." I remember Minister Milczanowski saying that he would 
like to appoint a competent person to this post. You are not a 
lawyer; you never worked in the ministry. What, then, are your 
qualifications? 
  [Sobotka] I was quite familiar with the ministry when I was 
a deputy -- it is my third term in office. I now, as well as 
previously, work in the Sejm Administration and on the Internal 
Affairs Committee. All the problems of MSW are focussed. 
  I was also a member of the Political Advisory Committee of 
the minister of internal affairs. 
  Important is also the fact that I served in the MSW Vistula 
Units. 
  The problems that I will tackle at the ministry will not be 
of a strictly legal nature; my experience will certainly come in 
handy in the ministry. I suppose that this is what Minister 
Milczanowski took into consideration when he chose me as a 
candidate for the post of deputy minister. 
  [Frydrychowicz] What will your tasks be in the ministry -- 
as a person sent there by the coalition, or, actually, by only 
one part of it? 
  [Sobotka] I certainly have not come to MSW to watch over the 
ministry's head, which various people, unfavorably disposed 
toward me, have been trying to imply for some time. The scope 
of MSW activities is regulated by law. I will simply be one of 
Minister Milczanowski's deputies. 
  Thus, I have not come to the ministry with special demands; 
I 
have come here to jointly steer it. The point is not to shape a 
separate policy of the ministry, but to participate in managing 
it and to bear joint responsibility for the fulfillment of tasks. 
  [Frydrychowicz] Mass media stresses the fact that you were a 
member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Polish 
United Workers' Party [PZPR]. Will this experience be an 
obstacle for you in the fulfillment of the present function? 
  [Sobotka] It will certainly not be an obstacle. There is 
nothing that I should be ashamed of in that period. The fact 
that in the final period of the functioning of PZPR I was a 
member of its leadership only enriched my experience in 
management. The fact that I participated in the work of the 
"round table," that is, in the activities that made it possible 
for Poles to reach agreement, is also quite significant. 
  I suppose that I have often proved that I can quietly 
discuss 
the most difficult problems and resolve them. Therefore, I 
treat my experience gained in PZPR and later in its leadership 
as useful in my fulfillment of the present state functions.

<F P=106> [Article by Marek Wielgo: "Coupon Reprivatization"] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Ownership Transformation [MPW] 
offers securities to those whose property was nationalized 
illegally in the 1940's and 1950's, not a return of the 
property. 
  Yesterday [6 May], the Economic Committee of the Council of 
Ministers [KERM] debated the draft law; KERM is then to send its 
remarks over to MPW. A preliminary version of the draft law 
which will take KERM's remarks into account, will most probably 
be announced on Tuesday [10 May]. It is quite possible that a 
first reading of the governmental draft reprivatization law and 
the already prepared draft coming from Sejm deputies, will take 
place in the Sejm at the end of May and the beginning of June. 
<H5>  A Limited Reprivatization </H5>
  MPW wants reprivatization to include not all those who have 
claims but only those whose property was taken away from them 
illegally in the 1944-58 period, as well as all those who have 
still not received the reimbursements they had been promised. 
Those former owners who have already received some form of 
benefit -- even if the benefit does not equal the value of the 
property lost -- would not be entitled to reimbursements. 
  The current residence of persons applying for 
reimbursements, 
would be irrelevant. Anybody who at the time of nationalization 
had Polish citizenship and has not lost it up to now, could 
apply for reimbursements. So reprivatization would also cover 
persons of dual citizenship. The issue of heirs to those whose 
property was nationalized, has not been settled yet. 
  According to preliminary estimates, reimbursements would be 
paid exclusively in the form of reprivatization coupons (this 
would also apply to former owners of Warsaw-area land). 
  But former owners would not get as much as experts would 
assess their losses to have been. For instance, if the value of 
the property taken away from an owner does not exceed 1 billion 
of today's zlotys, then the former owner would receive 1 billion 
zlotys in coupons. Former owners of property which was worth 
more than 1 billion would not receive the property's value in 
coupons. They would get 1 billion plus some part of what 
remains above that amount. 
  One would be able to introduce these reprivatization coupons 
(which should actually be called reimbursement coupons) into 
circulation for a period of up to 10 years. In order to retain 
the coupons' real value, they would be valorized by an indicator 
of investment price increases (there is preliminary talk of 
about 10 percent per year). 
  Therefore, an owner of such coupons could sell them for 
cash, 
could buy with them real estate put up for auction by gminas 
[small administrative units] and by the State Treasury, or 
exchange them for shares of enterprises being privatized. 
  Former owners would receive the right of preemption of their 
old real estate being sold by the State Treasury or by a gmina. 
  Ownership Transformation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek stated 
yesterday that he is opposed to holding a referendum in which 
all citizens would speak out on whom to return property to, and 
how much of it (the government is also considering such a 
possibility). 
<H5>  An Unlimited Reprivatization </H5>
  Another draft reprivatization law has been sitting in the 
Sejm for six months now. It was prepared jointly by MPW and 
associations comprising former owners in the summer of 1993 
(when there was no Sejm). The draft law found its way into the 
current Sejm as an initiative by Sejm deputies from virtually 
all deputies clubs. 
  Among other things, the draft law envisages a very 
comprehensive reprivatization (without the restrictions 
suggested by the government). In those cases where it is 
possible, property would be returned either in its natural form 
or in the form of a so-called unwanted property which means for 
instance waste land. Reprivatization coupons would be handed out 
as a last resort. 
  The law would not conflict with the interests of "third 
persons who acquired nationalized property in good faith" (for 
instance farmers who received land as a result of agrarian 
reforms, or factories established on the basis of nationalized 
plants). 
<H5>  Owners Protest </H5>
  A reprivatization council at MPW demands reimbursements in a 
natural form. According to Krzysztof Laszkiewicz, the council's 
chief, 2.5 million hectares of land is not being cultivated 
whereas there are some former owners who could utilize the land. 
Yesterday, the council expressed sharp criticism of the 
governmental initiative, and announced that the former owners 
will protest and will file a law suit over the governmental 
draft with international institutions designed to watch over 
observance of human rights, among them the UN and the Helsinki 
Committee.

<F P=106> [Report by "E.W.:" "Popiwek Until Year's End? Senate Adopted </F>
a Law on Regulation of Salaries"] 
  [Text] On 5 May the Senate adopted a neopopiwek [tax 
on excessive wage increases] law, with 51 votes in favor, 14 
against, and eight abstentions. In the only amendment 
submitted, the senators made the reservation that the law 
approved by them is to be in force until the end of the year. 
The document will go back to the Sejm, which must debate the 
amendment, and then it will wait for the president's signature. 
The law can become effective on the first day of the month 
following the month in which the law is announced. 
  The senators rejected a motion by Senator Zbigniew 
Romaszewski of "Solidarity" to completely reject the law, and 
they decided to refuse to accept an amendment submitted by 
Senator Piotr Andrzejewski which would have limited the law's 
scope to independent shaping of salaries by all economic units. 
  The law (similar to an earlier governmental document) 
provides that those enterprises that exceed the allowed salary 
limit will be penalized by a so-called sanction payment, which 
will be 1.5 zlotys for each zloty paid out above the norm. The 
payments will be directed to the state budget, with enterprises 
which send at least part of their production abroad, being given 
breaks. The law covers all state-owned and communal 
enterprises, state-owned banks, and companies where the State 
Treasury has no less than 80 percent of the shares. On the 
other hand, popiwek does not cover private enterprises or banks, 
firms with participation of foreign capital, or cultural 
institutions and convalescent homes. 
  Based on the law, enterprises will be able to select one of 
the following four methods of shaping salaries: a managerial 
contract, an agreement with a local State Treasury Chamber, a 
limit dependent on the previous year's profit-salary ratio in 
the enterprise, or salaries determined by a trilateral 
commission.

  [Text] The boat that the Slovene Ministry of Internal 
Affairs has ordered in Italy is a rescue vessel, not a military 
vessel. This is what has been asserted by its designer in an 
official police investigation. Here is a report by Mirjam 
Muzinic: 
  [Begin Muzinic recording] While Italian newspapers have 
swiftly taken up the story on the confiscation of a vessel 
ordered in Viareggio for the needs of the Slovene Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and paid for in Turin, today agencies devote 
hardly any attention to the event. What is involved is one of 
the large number of similar cases that our neighbors are used 
to, colleague journalists (Luca Daldi) from the Viareggio IL 
TIRENO told us on the telephone. It is known that the order was 
made by a middleman from Turin, who received 3.2 billion Italian 
Lire from Slovenia. The vessel is 20 meters long and a little 
more than 5 meters wide. It is equipped with radar, satellite 
navigator, depth gauge, night sights, and computer-operated 
navigation, something that would indicate that what is involved 
is a military vessel. 
  In the official police investigation, the designer, an 
eminent expert, (Sergio Sardos), born in (Pula), Croatia, and a 
long-time Italian citizen, denied this. Due to the bankruptcy 
process, the respective court has excluded the vessel from the 
estate fund, and ordered that it should be completed as soon as 
possible and delivered to the purchaser. All that is needed is 
the payment of the order, which has obviously stopped at the 
Italian middleman and is in the hands of the court. 
  According to the IL TIRENO's journalist, a prominent 
representative of the Slovene Ministry of Internal Affairs is 
expected to visit Viareggio this afternoon, something that the 
Ministry's spokesman Bozo Truden denied. Slovenia ordered the 
vessel in Italy when Igor Bavcar held the post of the minister 
of internal affairs. It should have been taken over in the 
middle of last September. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Knin, 9 May (TANJUG)--Representatives of the 
United Nations and the state leadership of the republic of Serb 
Krajina [RSK] agreed in Knin today that the talks between 
Croatia and Krajina resume on 18 May, when economic and 
humanitarian cooperation will be discussed. The venue has not 
yet been specified. Geneva and Karadjordjevo were proposed as 
possible venues today. The UN mediation team was led by Yasushi 
Akashi. General Bertrand Delapresle, the commander of the 
peacekeeping forces for the former Yugoslavia, and Kai Eide, 
deputy cochairman of the Geneva conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, were also in the UN team. 
  The RSK delegation consisted of Krajina President Milan 
Martic; Prime Minister Borisav Mikelic; Foreign Minister Milan 
Babic; Defense Minister Rade Tanjga, and Interior Minister Ilija 
Prijic. At a news conference, Akashi described the talks as 
open, useful, meaningful, and productive. He said three key 
questions in the peace process had been discussed--the 
implementation of the cease-fire agreement, the resumption of 
the RSK-Croatia talks on economic relations, and bilateral 
issues between the RSK and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. 
[passage omitted] 
  At the end of the news conference, Akashi said that his 
impression after the talks today was that the state leadership 
of Krajina was "for cooperation with UNPROFOR in the process of 
achieving peace and establishing economic relations". 
  "I am satisfied with the results of the talks today and am 
optimistic about relations in the future," Akashi said. 
  President Martic also said the talks had been productive. He 
praised Akashi as a man fighting for peace and stressed the need 
to lift the sanctions against Krajina so that the forthcoming 
talks with Croatia could take place on an equal footing. Martic 
said he believed that the forthcoming talks between the RSK and 
UNPROFOR would be fruitful and useful in the resolution of their 
bilateral relations and obligations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Svetozar Sarkanjac: "The Zagreb Agreement Is </F>
Being Tested in Bosanska Posavina"] 
  [Text] It is not necessary to waste too many words on how 
the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being reflected on the 
peace process in Croatia. The enthusiasm for peace created 
after the Washington and the Zagreb Agreements -- coordinated by 
the military and political regimes from Belgrade, Pale, and Knin 
-- were signed, has not only slowed down, but has almost come to 
a halt. Exactly those negative things have happened that were 
foreseen by the initiators of this peace process -- the U.S. and 
the Russian representatives. 
  In spite of certain problems, the first stage of the Zagreb 
Agreement has materialized in Eastern Croatia since an agreement 
on the demarcation line in this sector was signed. On behalf of 
"the two sides" the agreement was signed by Major General Djuro 
Decak, the commander of the Osijek region, and Major General 
Dusan Loncar, the commander of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps of 
the Krajina army. On behalf of the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] it was signed by Brigadier General van Dyck, the UN 
commander of Sector East. The demarcation line, around 410 km 
long and between several hundred and 2 km wide, was defined in 
detail by this agreement. This flexible width of the so-called 
buffer zone was reached after numerous specific requirements of 
both sides had been fulfilled. 
  If both sides had insisted on the 2 km width, which was 
foreseen by the Zagreb Agreement on buffer zones, the 
demarcation zone would have included parts of many urban areas 
on both sides. In that case, the Krajinans would have lost 
parts of the occupied Baranja village of Bilje, parts of Tenja 
near Osijek, as well as of parts of Mirkovci near Vinkovci. The 
Croatian side would have lost certain suburban Osijek areas, 
parts of important roads and manufacturing facilities, and a 
part of the town of Osijek. In order to avoid such illogical 
situations, it was decided that the demarcation line be flexible. 
<H5>  Unease About Gorazde </H5>
  The agreement concluding the first stage of the Zagreb 
Agreement was signed after a delay of several days since the 
events around Gorazde, especially the NATO bombardment of the 
Serbian positions there, upset the Krajina Serbs. Their 
reaction was -- at least in Sector East -- relatively 
tempestuous. A meeting of commissions at the UNPROFOR control 
point between Nemetin and Sarvas, which had already been agreed 
upon, was canceled, and, according to unofficial information, 
the Serbs blocked UN movements throughout the sector that day. 
Apart from that -- according to the first confirmed, but then 
denied statements by UN soldiers -- the Serbs took weapons 
already put away between Tenja, Mirkovci and Baranja. Since the 
local UNPROFOR denied the allegations of the Zagreb UNPROFOR, 
and since the Croatian Army representatives did not openly 
respond to the reported "exhibition" of Serbian weapons, nothing 
serious occurred. Even if something had happened, the weapons 
had already been returned to the warehouses. 
  This does not mean that something more serious cannot 
happen. 
Since the "Krajinan state" is very narrow in eastern Croatia, 
the Serbs were enabled by the Zagreb Agreement to store heavy 
weapons in Beli Manastir, Dalj, and Vukovar (something similar 
was made possible for the Croatian Army in Starigrad, Zadar, and 
Sibenik). We must not forget that not so long ago similar 
experiences with storing of weapons behind double locks proved 
to be extremely negative in this area. UN soldiers are now 
having the same experience in Sarajevo. What does it mean for 
security if, for example, a tank at full combat readiness is 
under a simple lock in a warehouse guarded by several frightened 
UN soldiers? Nothing! Just as if you had left your suitcase at 
the railroad station left luggage office for when you needed it. 
The only difference between checking in a tank and a suitcase 
is that you have to pay to reclaim it at the railroad station. 
<H5>  Bad Storage of Weapons </H5>
  The proper storage of heavy weapons under UN control would 
include a completely different procedure, which has, 
unfortunately, never been applied in the former Yugoslavia. 
Fuel and lubricants, for example, have to be drained out of a 
tank and put into storage. After that, the communications system 
should be removed and stored in some other place together with 
ammunition, if possible far from the central warehouse. When 
the owner of the tank stored in this way wants to take it by 
force, he needs at least two or three days to get it ready for 
combat. At the same time, the other side, which should be 
granted security by this kind of storage, has enough time to see 
what the enemy is up to. Such an example of heavy weapons 
storage is nothing new or unknown. On the contrary, this system 
has already been applied in some earlier UN peacekeeping 
operations in other crisis areas. 
  A great many things, which in other crisis areas ended with 
peace, have not been successful in the former Yugoslavia. 
Therefore we should be pleased with the agreement reached in 
eastern Slavonia since even such a situation was inconceivable 
some time ago. Especially significant is the cooperativeness of 
the Serbian negotiators, who are ready to grant certain 
concessions to the Croatian side, although they always expect 
something in return. Generally speaking, life is easier in 
eastern Slavonia now. 
  Commenting on the new situation, Milan Martic, the 
"president 
of the republic of Serbian Krajina," told journalists during his 
visit to Baranja that he wished the peace process to continue, 
especially those parts of it which concern economic issues. As 
usual, the Serbian side imposed new conditions. The first was 
that the negotiations should not be held at the Russian Embassy 
in Zagreb. 
<H5>  Martic's Blackmail </H5>
  "Negotiations on the establishment of economic relations 
with 
the Croatian side can be held at any Russian embassy in the 
world, except for those in Croatia and Germany," Martic said, 
and added another condition. "We can negotiate with Croats only 
as equal partners, as two equal states. In order to meet this 
condition, the UN Security Council has to lift the sanctions 
imposed on the "Krajinans" according to Resolution 820. If 
normal communications with Hungary and Slovenia are not made 
possible, we cannot negotiate on the second stage," Martic 
stated decisively. 
  It does not matter whether the Krajina leadership is serious 
or whether they are only dragging out the peace process since 
the result is, at least for the near future, the same. The 
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina support them since they have 
"objective" reasons for stalling for time. 
<H5>  The Key Is Bosanska Posavina </H5>
  Apart from all this, further negotiations between Croatia 
and 
the "Krajinans," especially in this part of Croatia, can be 
seriously affected by new activities by the Bosnian Serbs in 
Bosanska Posavina. The aim of the latest military movements of 
the Bosnian Serbs in this area is perfectly clear: the 
enlargement of the "life corridor" to a width which will 
guarantee them free passage between Banja Luka and Belgrade and 
beyond to Knin. The present corridor is too narrow for the 
Serbs. It can easily be closed by the coordinated action of the 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council] from the northern part of the 
corridor (the unoccupied area around Orasje) and of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from the southern part (from the direction of 
Gradacac or Tuzla). 
  During his recent visit to the occupied Bosanski Samac and 
Brcko, where the Serbs celebrated the second anniversary of 
"liberation," General Manojlo Milovanovic openly threatened 
Croatia with attacks against targets in Croatian territory. 
Without any scruples he stated that he could bring 20,000 
soldiers to Bosanska Posavina to widen the corridor. In other 
words he warned the Croats against attacking the northern 
corridor line as long as they are widening the corridor toward 
the south. 
  As soon as the Gorazde action is completed, the Bosnian 
Serbs 
will have a large number of soldiers at their disposal who can 
be deployed in Bosanska Posavina. After the massacre in Gorazde 
it cannot be expected that the Serbs can be scared by 
international community threats, especially if they remain at 
the present level.

<F P=106> [Article by Gordan Nuhanovic: "Messrs. and Comrade </F>
Ministers"] 
  [Text] When we tried to learn from Minister Mudrinic 
by fax whether it is true that his ministry bought him an 
apartment in an elite Zagreb neighborhood for 570,000 German 
marks [DM] and that he then purchased it for only DM43,000, we 
received no response. 
  Do all the deviations at the top ranks of state 
power--whether they relate to unconstitutional allotments of 
apartments to officials, ownership transformation, "managerial 
loans," smuggling under the auspices of the state, or similar 
matters--find an alibi in the government's official 
announcements? Although the demagogic nature of similar 
government announcements in several former cases was utterly 
obvious, the government flinched a little after HSLS [Croatian 
Social-Liberal Party] deputy Mladen Vilfan repeated his question 
at the relevant hour in the House of Deputies, whereby he 
demanded an explanation from Valentic of the controversial 1986 
decree on the basis of which around 140 mostly luxurious 
apartments in Croatia were allocated "for use with the option to 
buy" to state functionaries, i.e., high-ranking HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] officials. Specifically, Vilfan said that 
five months ago Valentic only partially answered his question of 
who received an apartment on the basis of the decree in 
question, and in what manner, while in response to his related 
question "how many apartments were distributed through public 
enterprises and with whose money were they all bought?" the 
prime minister said that that is a "delicate question that 
demands serious study of the material and information-gathering" 
and that he was not yet in a position to provide an answer. HSLS 
sources talk about 40 apartments that were allocated through 
public enterprises, and Vilfan considers it unacceptable that 
the government and Prime Minister Valentic have been avoiding an 
answer for nearly six months, but that very silence is itself 
significant enough, Mladen Vilfan believes. 
<H5>  Minister's Silence </H5>
  At the same time, the silence of Minister Ivica Mudrinic 
also 
seems very significant. Checking on the statements made by 
Mladen Vilfan and Boze Kovacevic in the House of Deputies, when 
Mudrinic's 203-square-meter apartment in the elite Zagreb 
neighborhood of Zelengaj was "pilloried," we tried to learn from 
Minister Mudrinic by fax whether it is true that his ministry 
bought him that apartment for DM570,000, only for him to then 
purchase it for only DM43,000. However, we did not receive any 
response from the ministry in Zagreb's "little cube." 
  Judging from the "minister's silence" and from the firm 
guarantees expressed by the HSLS to the effect that they are in 
possession of all the purchase and sales contracts relevant to 
Mudrinic's apartment, the reasoning behind the issue is very 
simple and in fact tragically clear--the state gave the minister 
of trade and communication nearly half a million German marks. 
  No one from the cabinet was present at the HSLS 
interpellation on rescinding the controversial decree on 
functionary apartments in the House of Deputies. 
  Although that proposal was rejected, Marijan Prus, as the 
government's representative and otherwise the head of the Office 
for Legislation, acknowledged in a certain sense that the decree 
in question is in conflict with the Croatian Constitution, which 
does not recognize the institution of "social ownership." Using 
hackneyed legal terms, Prus tried to explain to the deputies 
that among the "resources in social ownership that have not been 
transformed to state ownership there are apartments, so that 
based on the Law on Housing, apartments can be turned over for 
use by state officials," noting that the deadline for bringing 
the law into line with the Constitution is 31 June [as 
published]. One must not forget that that deadline has already 
been extended twice thus far, so that Prus's reply prompted 
uncertainty concerning whether the government can freely violate 
the Croatian Constitution up to 31 June simply because the law 
has not yet been fully brought into line with the Constitution. 
<H5>  Unconstitutional Allocation </H5>
  Despite public attempts by the political leadership to 
minimize the affair surrounding functionaries' apartments in the 
sense of "don't make waves," the manner in which apartments are 
allocated to republican officials is completely transparent and 
unconstitutional. Specifically, the notion of "tenant housing 
rights" is in correlation with the notion of "social ownership," 
and since the 1986 decree on functionary apartments corresponds 
directly with obsolete tenant housing rights, the 
unconstitutional positions on the basis of which the government 
housing commission has allocated 136 apartments to state 
officials since 1990 are quite clear. Moreover, according to 
reliable information that the HSLS intends to bring before the 
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia very soon, all 
of those apartments were repurchased at extremely low prices, on 
the average for around 5 percent of the actual market value of 
such apartments. Vilfan says that in this regard he has concrete 
data on the apartments of Gojko Susak (237 square meters), 
Vladimir Seks (65 square meters), and former Minister Babac (151 
square meters), while the most curious case is undoubtedly the 
five-room residential apartment of Minister Mudrinic. Gojko 
Susak's apartment on Torbareva Street was completely renovated 
with money from the Ministry of Defense, and Branko Babac moved 
into his spacious apartment a month before ceasing to perform 
his ministerial duties. 
  Experts have also spoken up about the unconstitutional 
character of the "allocation of apartments to state officials 
for use with the option to buy." The editor of the specialist 
journal INFORMATOR, jurist Ljerka Abramovic, concludes in one of 
her expert commentaries that the allocation of "all 136 
apartments to state officials is a violation of the Constitution 
of the Republic of Croatia, which implies criminal 
accountability, for which the public legal office and state 
attorney are responsible." The same opinion is held by Dr. 
Bojana Tomasevic, a professor at the School of Economics and 
expert on the housing issue. In her opinion, "giving apartments 
away for use free of charge is a practice adopted from Soviet 
collective ownership, while here this right has been expanded to 
privileged leaders and has become unlimited, permanent, and 
transferrable to all family members. This has made it possible 
to satisfy the private interests of beneficiaries of tenant 
housing rights contrary to the interests of all `receivers' of 
apartments and of personal funds-revenues with which the social 
housing fund was created." 
<H5>  Fox Hunt </H5>
  In the hopes of finding legal "substantiation" to sanction 
the unconstitutional decree on giving apartments to state 
functionaries for their use, former state attorney Stjepan 
Herceg secretly invited experts from the School of Law to a 
consultation on the issue. However, all of that remained under a 
veil of mystical silence. We were unable to learn any further 
details even from the Office for Property Administration of the 
Republic of Croatia, where we were told by the assistant 
director of that office, Mr. Martinic, that after the prime 
minister's response to the liberals in the Assembly "it would be 
stupid for me to repeat or refute it because I am only a civil 
servant, but from my perspective the liberal initiative looks 
like a fox hunt, or rather an attempt to use those apartments 
for political ends." Regardless of whether this was an 
expression of awkwardness or, more likely, a lack of more 
appropriate counterarguments, the liberals are inclined to 
maintain that members of the Valentic cabinet simply lacked both 
the professional and the moral justification that would have 
allowed them to attend the HSLS's latest Assembly interpellation 
on apartments for state officials. 
  In accordance with the logic of the voting machinery, the 
House of Deputies flatly refused to accept a revision of either 
the communist Law on Housing or the notorious decree on 
apartments for state functionaries. The Valentic government, 
which has passed more than 300 laws and decrees during its term, 
has apparently not found "credible" reasons to intervene in the 
area of functionary apartments. "And how could they," we were 
told by one HDZ member who is regarded in the party as a 
"Manolicist," "when all of them view their political position as 
a privilege of the privileged and when they are directly 
interested in seeing to it that the Croatia Constitution is not 
fully respected." A flat calculation indicates nearly DM30 
million that the state has benevolently given to the "lucky 
recipients" of the 136 apartments in one way or another. 
Although under the present-day circumstances in which the state 
finds itself any moralizing about such actions by the state 
leadership is utterly superfluous, the "political apartments" of 
Minister Mudrinic, Minister Susak, and Vice President Seks are 
only the tip of the iceberg of profound and significant 
hypocrisy, in which the very people who should be most 
interested in ethical practices by virtue of their position and 
corresponding reputation are in fact becoming its generators 
through their actions. What the 50,000 homeless people in Zagreb 
alone would have to say about this is indeed a rhetorical 
question. 
<H5>  Rule of the Stronger </H5>
  Comparing this with the fact that families whose houses were 
completely destroyed by the war (category 3) have each received 
DM6,000 is perhaps the best indication of the discriminatory 
character of allocations of budgetary resources, in the 
implementation of which all citizens of Croatia are equal 
participants every day. In the Spanish political system at a 
time of a pronounced increase in corruption in the mid-1970's, 
the name "caudillism" took root among the public for this social 
phenomenon, signifying the criminal coupling of political and 
economic centers of power, among which the distribution of 
public property was systematically carried out. This "alliance" 
quickly broke up due to mutual discord, but the notion of 
"caudillism" has remained as a real danger in the modern age. A 
danger that threatens us like Damocles's sword in so-called 
interim periods when the rule of law gives way to lavish 
privileges, abuses, and plunder. Although it is not fair to link 
the situation in Croatia to such extreme deviations, in any 
emerging legal system, and thus in the Croatian one as well, 
tolerance of any forms of corruption--beginning with "apartments 
for functionaries" and including all other forms of societal 
pathology--means that rule of the stronger is favored over the 
rule of law. 
  Minister Mudrinic's reward for his work at the Ministry of 
Trade and Communication, amounting to half a million German 
marks, is greater than the annual income of the U.S. President, 
some people have concluded. Various things from an older 
Constitution, the U.S. one, have been incorporated into the 
Croatian Constitution, but apparently it is very hard for one 
old American rule to penetrate the consciousness of local 
politicians, namely: If you enter the world of politics with one 
dollar, you may not take a single cent more than that dollar 
back out, only one cent less.

  [Text] The third day of negotiations on the implementation 
of the Washington agreement between the Croats and Bosniaks 
ended at the U.S. Embassy with the exchange of maps. Tihomir 
Vinkovic reports from Vienna: 
  [Vinkovic] The negotiations lasted a long time, and some 
progress was made after all. The questions of external borders 
with the Serbs, and of the leaderhip of the federation and the 
government have been been resolved in principle. The question 
that remains to be resolved is the number of the cantons in the 
federation and their borders. The maps were drafted and 
exchanged at the end of today's round of talks. The delegation 
of the Bosnian Croats, led by Kresimir Zubak, exchanged the 
delineation maps with the Bosniak delegation, led by Haris 
Silajdzic. 
  The contentious areas are central Bosnia and the 
municipalities of Mostar and Stolac. The positions on central 
Bosnia have converged, Kresimir Zubak said. But is this enough 
to reach an agreement? 
  The part of the negotiations dealing with the relations 
between the Bosniak-Croat federation and the Republic of Croatia 
passed without difficulties. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic took part in it. 
  The only certain thing is that the negotiations will 
continue 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Bosniak and Croatian delegations have continued 
talks in Vienna on the implementation of the Constitution of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most attention today was 
devoted to the borders between cantons and the number of cantons 
within the federation. Our special correspondent, Amir Hodzic, 
reports from Vienna: 
  [Begin Hodzic recording] Stands have so far been coordinated 
on the canton of Foca with a majority Croatian population and 
[word indistinct] of two cantons in central Bosnia and the Lasva 
Valley. There have been a few disputes about the status of 
Gornji Vakuf, that is, individual districts in the outskirts of 
the commune's territory. Views about the cantonal setup of 
Herzegovina are somewhat different. Our delegation is of the 
opinion that the commune of Stolac with (?Dubrava) Plateau and 
the region along the left side of the Neretva River should be a 
canton with the Bosniak-Muslim majority population because it 
has an absolute majority of 55 percent of Bosniak people. For 
this reason, as well as for the reasons of tradition, geography, 
economy, communications, and other reasons it should be a 
special cantonal entity. 
  The Croatian delegation, however, offers one canton that 
would have an ethnic [word indistinct] with a majority Croatian 
population, its borders would be drawn at the foot of the 
Jablanica Mountain, along the Neretva Valley, and it would 
encompass the whole of the Stolac Commune. As a major, 
principled question is involved here, participants in the talks 
will focus their attention on it in the afternoon as well so 
that a realistic agreement can be reached at the end. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Tihomir Vinkovic from Vienna] </F>
  [Excerpt] Muslim-Croat talks on the implementation of the 
Washington agreement resumed today. Croats and Bosniaks 
discussed canton borders of the Federation, Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic said at the end of this morning's round of 
talks. The maps are still in front of the negotiators. Where 
is the solution? I think that we made an important step forward 
and our standpoints on central Bosnia are converging, Kresimir 
Zubak, the head of the Croat delegation from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
said, adding that the delegations are continuing to present 
their views on Herzegovina, and that the process of 
harmonization continues. It seems that the main reason why no 
agreement has yet been reached are the internal cantonal borders 
of the Bosniak-Croat Federation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Bernard Besserglik] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, May 10 (AFP) -- Bosnia's loyalist Serbs 
begin a series of meetings in foreign capitals Wednesday to 
demand a role in peace talks on an equal footing with the 
separatist Serbs of Radovan Karadzic. A delegation invited to 
Moscow will argue before the Duma that the Serb Civic Council, 
which supports Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, has as much 
right to represent Bosnia's Serb community as the 
self-proclaimed Serb republic based in Pale, the council's 
leader, Mirko Pejanovic, told AFP. 
  Delegates will visit Paris later in the month and have also 
been invited to Washington and the European Community in 
Brussels, he said. The reluctance so far of foreign governments 
to recognise the representativeness of the loyalist Serb 
leadership is a serious mistake, Pejanovic believed, pointing 
out that the number of Serbs in the territory controlled by Pale 
is under half the total of 1.3 million who lived in the pre-war 
republic. Of the 400,000 Bosnian Serbs who fled the fighting 
that broke out two years ago to Serbia and Montenegro and the 
100,000 in Europe, the great majority support the loyalist 
position, he said. 
  Pejanovic, a member of Bosnia's collective presidency, 
claimed the moral high ground with the argument that since 
loyalist Serbs shared the suffering of the Moslems and Croats 
during the bombardment of Sarajevo by the Pale forces, they 
represent a unique force for reconciliation. "We are a moral 
and peace factor because we are for a multicultural society with 
equal rights for all groups and seek a negotiated and political 
solution. Karadzic has ruled out a multicultural society, and 
offers only more war," he said. 
  The Civic Council was elected by a consultative assembly in 
late March to represent the 200,000 loyalist Serbs in Bosnia, of 
whom around 60,000 live in Sarajevo. 
  "We believe that in order to act (in the Bosnian conflict), 
the international community must include the loyal Serbs," 
Pejanovic said. "We don't want to represent the Karadzic Serbs, 
we don't want to represent criminals. But we cannot accept that 
he with his lies represents us." 
  While Pejanovic and other Civil Council leaders dispute the 
legitimacy they believe foreign governments are abusively 
attributing to the Serbs in Pale, the loyalties of the Serbs in 
both camps are hard to assess. Those who remained in 
government-controlled territory did so for a variety of reasons, 
in which regard for legality and the democratic process may have 
been stronger than any firm commitment to the govermnment that 
emerged from parliamentary elections in 1991. 
  "Loyalist Serbs need not be regarded as pro-government," 
presidential advisor Kemal Muftic said. "They are pro-Bosnian 
and patriotic. Governments come and go." The loyalties of 
individual Serbs have been tested as the conflict has developed. 
They have been regarded by some as a potential fifth column -- 
there were attacks on Serbs during the early stages of the war 
-- and have themselves looked with growing unease on signs of 
increasing Islamic sensibility in some government ministries. 
  A number of Serbs, difficult to quantify, are tempted to 
leave if only because of the immense physical devastation 
inflicted on this city and the general hardship. The same could 
be said of many Moslems and Croats. The morale of Serbs in 
Pale-controlled territory is said by reporters who have visited 
the provinces to be flagging, and Civic Council secretary Gavrlo 
Grahovac said he had received secret messages of support from 
such separatist strongholds as Banja Luka and Trebinje. 
  "Karadzic's power is not greater than ours," he said. "It's 
just that he has more weapons." 
  Grahovac, a publisher, said he and his wife had been wary 
during the early stages of the conflict. "Some people were 
killed on the street just because they were Serbs." But the 
antipathy of non-Serbs had been "very little, compared with what 
the Karadzic Serbs did." He spoke of the "shame of many" in the 
Serb community at the actions of the separatists, and looked 
back with fondness at the days when "there were no Serbs, or 
Moslems, or Croats, only Yugoslavs."

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 9 (AFP) -- UN forces in the Bosnian 
capital have failed to locate a Bosnian Serb tank secreted in a 
Sarajevo suburb since late Friday, UN Protection Force spokesman 
Eric Chaperon said here Monday. UN military observers continued 
to patrol the Grbavica sector, and if the tank was found 
UNPROFOR would go and fetch it, Major Chaperon said. Another UN 
officer noted the Serbs were letting very few military observers 
into the area. 
  The tank, probably a T-34, disappeared late on Friday while 
being transported on a truck from Bosnian Serb headquarters at 
Pale in violation of the 20-ki1ometre (12.5-mile) exclusion zone 
ordered by NATO to bar heavy weaponry around Sarajevo. Chaperon 
reported rising tension at Mostar in the south, and some mortar 
fire at Celic and Visoko in the north-east. He said several 
dozen armed Serb militiamen were still in position on the right 
bank of the river Drina in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, in 
defiance of an exclusion zone order.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May l0 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Government 
Army has deployed mortars and anti-aircraft guns near Sarajevo 
in violation of the heavy arms exclusion zone around the city, 
UN officials said Tuesday [10 May]. UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) spokesman Eric Chaperon said the Moslem-led forces 
had heavy weapons and many patrols on Mount Igman, to the west 
of the city, facing Bosnian Serb lines within the 20-kilometre 
(12.5-mile) exclusion zone ordered by NATO in February under the 
threat of air strikes. 
  Another UNPROFOR officer, speaking anonymously, said 
helicopter patrols had on Monday counted four mortars and two 
anti-aircraft guns deployed alongside 1,000 Bosnian army troops 
around Mount Igman, a strategic height overlooking the Bosnian 
capital. Chaperon also reported fresh fighting between Bosnian 
troops loyal to President Alija Izetbegovic and soldiers 
following orders of Fikret Abdic, the renegade Moslem leader of 
the northwestern Bosnian pocket of Bihac.

  [Text] The State Committee of Bosnia-Herzegovina for 
Relations with the United Nations warns of a very serious 
problem regarding the passage of humanitarian convoys on the 
road leading from the Dalmatian coast toward central Bosnia and 
Sarajevo. What is involved is the measure taken by the Ministry 
of Traffic and Communications and the (?Roads) Public Enterprise 
of the so-called Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna that -- in 
conformity with the conclusion made by the government of the 
so-called Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna on 5 April -- limits 
the passage of vehicles of a certain weight along the said road, 
introduces a road toll, and limits the travelling time and speed. 
  These restrictions make it completely impossible for the 
UNHCR and its partners to continue supplying central Bosnia and 
Sarajevo with food and other kinds of aid. According to the 
Information Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina, (Karen Kong 
abu-Zaid), head of the UNHCR mission of Bosnia, informed Dr. 
Hasan Muratovic, chairman of the State Committee of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for Relations with United Nations, about this 
problem and asked him for all available measures to be taken 
with a view to lifting the said restrictions and enabling normal 
supplies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy in Bosnia, </F>
by Isabelle Lasserre in Zagreb; date not given: "Akashi: The 
United Nations Cannot Impose Itself in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] [Lasserre] Did you think when you left Cambodia that 
your mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be so difficult? 
  [Akashi] Yes, and I had no illusions. In peace-keeping 
operations, there are no easy missions and each one is unique. 
It requires patience, obstinacy, and flexibility. The record 
in the former Yugoslavia is fairly positive. Problems remain, 
but I can see light at the end of the tunnel. 
  [Lasserre] You are accused of being conciliatory toward the 
Bosnian Serbs. What is your answer? 
  [Akashi] People think that the United Nations can impose its 
will on the warring sides. That is not true. Moreover, the sad 
fate of negotiators is that they are not able to choose those 
with whom they negotiate, or to display their preferences. We 
have spent the most time with the Serbs, and we have shown an 
extremely firm attitude. We can be proud of what we have done. 
  [Lasserre] Why did you refuse to use force in Gorazde? 
  [Akashi] The threat of air strikes was enough and very 
useful 
to the negotiations. We succeeded without having to use force. 
  [Lasserre] Do you not have the impression of being used by 
the Serbs and serving their interests? 
  [Akashi] Not at all. The United Nations has its own 
viewpoint. We are the bridge across which the different sides 
continue to talk. It would be the end of the UN mission if it 
were seen as a participant in this war. 
  [Lasserre] What do you think of Radovan Karadzic? Do you 
regard him as a man of peace? 
  [Akashi] You will read that in my memoirs... The leaders 
with whom I am negotiating represent their populations. I make 
no difference between them. I try to be as objective and 
impartial as possible. 
  [Lasserre] You have been strongly criticized. The Bosnian 
Government has called for your resignation. Are you affected by 
that? 
  [Akashi] Not much. I am calm and not very sensitive to 
pressure. The UN secretary general has expressed his complete 
confidence in me. I have enough strength not to listen to 
rumors, most especially those coming from people who know 
nothing of the situation. It is easy to simplify matters. But 
the real situation is never black or white, but somewhere 
between the two, in a gray area. 
  [Lasserre] So, you do not question your method, i.e., 
negotiation, and its limits? 
  [Akashi] No. Why always be so pessimistic and overdramatize 
things? We must fight against the simplistic solutions demanded 
by impatient people. Negotiations must be carried out with 
everybody and must succeed in the long term. The Serbs are not 
unmoved by our arguments. 
  [Lasserre] Will the United Nations emerge unchanged from the 
former Yugoslavia? 
  [Akashi] If we succeed, the United Nations will emerge from 
here stronger than before. If we fail, it will suffer a setback 
from which it will be difficult to recover for 10 years. But 
peace here cannot be built without the United Nations. Here, we 
sometimes show signs of weakness, but we are indispensible. In 
the final analysis, it is the aspirations of the peoples of 
Bosnia which will determine our success or failure. 
  [Lasserre] Has your action in Cambodia and then in the 
former 
Yugoslavia served Japan and its ambition to join the UN Security 
Council? 
  [Akashi] I have not served Japanese interests and I am 
embarrassed by my country's timidity. I have urged my political 
friends to send troops to the former Yugoslavia. I criticize 
them for not having done so yet. If my work one day makes it 
possible to arouse more active participation in the peacekeeping 
operations, I will be happy.

  [Text] Today, the joint aggressors stepped up their attacks 
on the Bihac region [words indistinct]. As regards their 
furious assaults, the initiative was taken by the members of the 
treacherous Kladusa paramilitaries [Fikret Abdic's forces], who 
in the early hours of this morning started pounding the 
demarcation lines with all their artillery and other weapons. 
There were also very heavy attacks in Cazin's border areas 
[words indistinct]. 
  In addition to this they are trying to infiltrate commando 
groups. The attacks are being spearheaded by gangs of hardened 
criminals and mercenaries who leave devastation in their wake. 
There is a considerable number of casualties, fatalities, and 
seriously wounded people, in the wake of today's murderous 
attacks. Abdic's mercenaries continue to launch artillery 
attacks in other areas. [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [Article by Radovan Kovacevic: "Continuation of the Muslim </F>
Spring Offensive"] 
  [Text] "We will go for all or nothing," Alija Izetbegovic 
declared yesterday in Sarajevo at a rally in support of Gorazde. 
He added at the same time the characteristic explanation for 
this key thesis of his: "Only strength is respected in this 
world." 
  It is easiest to explain his violent anger in terms of the 
military defeat in the Drina Valley, where an entire corps of 
his suffered defeat. An analysis of reports from the battlefield 
these days nevertheless suggests some serious assessments. 
  Four days ago, that is, Colonel General Ante Roso, commander 
of the General Staff of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], 
declared in central Bosnia that "the war is not over yet." And 
immediately thereafter, along with General Rasim Delic, his 
counterpart in the Muslim armed forces [MOS], he went on an 
inspection of his units in the area of Zenica, Zavidovici, and 
northward all the way to Gradacac. 
<H5>  The Actions of the Bosnian Muslims </H5>
  Actions like these on the part of the commanders have become 
routine since the Washington agreement. Their purpose, it is 
judged in the staffs of the army of the Srpska republic [RS], is 
to coordinate the armed actions of the Muslims and Croats. 
  Confirmation of this has arrived from Zagreb, where a 
meeting 
of the General Staff of the Croatian Army [HV] was held 
recently; mobilization of Croatian and Muslim refugees from 
Bosnia who have taken shelter in Croatian cities began soon 
afterward. The 112th HVO Brigade has just been formed from 
former inhabitants of Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca. An immense 
number of them undoubtedly still remember how in the spring of 
last year they had to flee to Vlasic in the face of the Muslim 
offensive in the Lasva Valley, and emergency assistance was 
offered to them by units of the army of the RS.... 
  Allies, however, are highly perishable goods in this war. 
Following the merciless showdown between the Muslims and Croats, 
which lasted more than a year, a combined brigade of the HVO has 
been sent to the area of Usora, Zepce, and Zavidovici. 
  Continuation of the spring offensive is being mentioned in 
the staffs more and more frequently. Gorazde, according to many, 
including even Gen. Michael Rose, was a focal point of limited 
tactical importance. Aside from what we have mentioned, the 
following details indicate the strategic objectives of the 
Croatian-Muslim coalition. The level of combat readiness of the 
HV, especially the artillery and engineers, has been upgraded in 
Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Samac, Orasje, and Zupanja. Six 
hundred soldiers who have arrived from the area of Rijeka have 
also been deployed there. Is it perhaps because as better 
swimmers they are to swim across the Sava as part of a future 
beachhead operation? 
<H5>  Ambitions and Appetites </H5>
  Five days ago, POLITIKA published the observation of the 
defense command of Majevica that no fewer than 28 brigades of 
the MOS had built up in the Tuzla region. The news is similar 
from Kupres: HVO troops are arriving from the direction of 
Livno, Duvno, and Sujica. 
  The offensive campaign is certain, and in many assessments 
the main strike of the Muslim force could be directed at Brcko, 
where there would be combined action with Croatian troops. 
Yesterday's artillery-infantry attacks on Serbian positions in 
Brka, which is 9 km from Brcko, along with a number of similar 
ones, probably represent only a "feeling" of the enemy pulse. 
  Around Ozren it is no longer a question of that, but of 
incessant fierce attacks. Thus the command of the tactical group 
of brigades there had to issue a sharp warning to the Muslim 
authorities in Banovici, Lukavac, Gracanica, and Tuzla that it 
would "take countermeasures" unless they calmed down. 
  The situation is similar in Doboj and Teslic. The shelling 
of 
these Serbian cities has gone on for more than two years with 
brief intervals. 
  The Muslim army, it is acknowledged in Serbian staffs, is 
considerably better-organized than a few months ago, and its 
ambitions (in accordance with the territorial appetites of the 
top Izetbegovic leadership) are growing. The lack of armament 
and especially artillery ammunition is already being overcome 
regardless of the well-known embargo. They are using Croatian 
seaports on the Adriatic for imports from Turkey and the Arab 
countries. Numerical superiority and considerable improvement of 
maneuverability are a challenge difficult to resist.... 
  The response to all this in the high-level circles of the 
army of the RS is that the situation is under control, that is, 
that the Serbian forces are adequate along all the lines of 
possible offensive strikes, which is one of the ways of 
shortening the length of the war. The more reasonable option is 
that of negotiation, but it still seems far away from this kind 
of Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 9 (TANJUG) -- Romanian delegation 
chief Theodore Mircea said Monday in Belgrade that his 
government had already drawn up agreements on the strengthening 
of economic cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(F.R.Y.) once the U.N. sanctions are lifted. 
  These agreements are aimed at putting right the present 
injustice and giving to the F.R.Y. the status of principal 
Romania's economic partner, Mircea told Serbian Government 
Minister Dragan Tomic during their meeting, Serbian Information 
Ministry has announced. 
  Even in the present situation, Romania has strived through 
allowed activities to maintain cooperation with Yugoslavia. 
During one year, it addressed to the sanctions committee one 
thousand requests for humanitarian exports to the F.R.Y., but 
only 334 of these requests worth 456 million dollars were 
granted. The Romanian Government believes that authorizations 
for humanitarian exports to the F.R.Y. should from now on be 
granted more speedily and frequently, and will persevere in its 
requests to this end, the ministry communique says. 
  Tomic said that his talks with the Romanian delegation, 
which 
comprises government repgesentatives, businessmen and experts in 
economic development, were paving the way for a more fruitful 
economic cooperation in all fields in the joint interest, as 
soon as sanctions are lifted. The cooperation continues even in 
conditions of international embargo, which is causing great 
losses to Yugoslav and Romanian economies, he added. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on 
Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) on May 31, 1992 because of Yugoslavia's 
alleged military involvement in the civil war in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The arrival of the Romanian delegation for a several-day 
visit to Serbia was agreed at the highest state level during 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Romania last 
month. During that visit, the two sides had expressed interest 
in market transformation, privatization and economic integration 
in the Balkans, especially as the united Europe is now 
finalizing its own integration process, the communique said.

<F P=106> [Deutsche Welle-attributed report: "Chetnik Leader Arkan </F>
Demands the Deportation of 700,000 Albanians From Kosovo to 
Albania"] 
  [Text] Although it is true that the message of Serbian 
Patriarch Pavel II to believers and the president called for an 
end to the war and for a Christian peace, the longing for peace 
in Serbia shines side by side with the ever-waning NATO threat 
of action if there is no immediate withdrawal from Gorazde. 
According to a recent poll, 40 percent of the people want the 
occupied territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be retained, 
whereas 60 percent favor unification with other parts of the 
former Yugoslavia. Similar answers were also given with regard 
to the consequences of the [UN] sanctions. Of those polled, 20 
percent think that the sanctions against the Serbs and Croats in 
Bosnia [as published] could remain in force for another couple 
of months, while 40 percent argue that the sanctions should be 
lifted because the country is facing starvation. Any belief 
that the super-dinar might work wonders has dwindled into 
insignificance. The Easter liturgy, which was broadcast on all 
the radio and television stations of former Yugoslavia, was 
conducted by Patriarch Pavel II in the monastery of Peja in 
Kosova. The Serbian militants see this liturgy as representing 
their rightful claim to part to Kosova and Metohija -- the 
heartland of the medieval Serbian empire. 
  The chetnik leader Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, an individual 
who is wanted by Interpol as a war criminal and whose Party of 
Serbian Unity suffered a fiasco in the last elections, last 
Friday [29 April] in Prishtina, in the presence of his 
idolaters, demanded the deportation of 700,000 [Kosovar] 
Albanians to Albania. Arkan threatened to amputate the legs of 
the U.S. soldiers stationed in the neighboring republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
if they dared to cross the border with Kosova. At the same time 
he publicly made numerous territorial claims on Macedonia. 
  On the eve of the Orthodox Easter, the army of the former 
Yugoslavia ended its large-scale military maneuvers in Kosova 
and Sandzak, which, according to the chief of the [Yugoslav 
Army's] General Staff, showed that the Yugoslav Army fears no 
enemy whatsoever.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fear of Responsibility `Abolishes' </F>
the Chetniks"] 
  [Text] "An attempt has been executed to assassinate an 
organization that served as a basis for the founding of the 
Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and later became the backbone of the 
party, from which the self-abolished chetnik duke rose to the 
very top of Serbian policy," reads the statement of the SRS 
branches for Montenegro and Serbia, issued in reaction to 
[Vojislav] Seselj's Radicals' decision to abolish and disband 
the Serbian chetnik movement. 
  Dr. Seselj, acting according to the "abracadabra" principle, 
is attempting yet another double political somersault aimed at 
achieving a change in the course of events on the Serbian 
political scene and baffling the public. However, he will not 
succeed. Actually, he cannot succeed, because the Serbian people 
have passed the test of political maturity. These people no 
longer accept the reheated lies and deceptions packaged in a 
national wrapping [sentence as published]. 
  At a moment when the recent chetnik duke, who has never 
smelled gunpowder, is losing his reputation and trust among the 
Serbian people and the Serbian Radicals, it seems that he has 
also lost his patience. 
  It seems that he wishes to forget that a great many of these 
patriots and volunteers were sent to the front without any 
military training, and that they were led by officers that he 
[Seselj] appointed, who did not have the necessary military 
knowledge or experience, which resulted in a great number of 
deaths and injuries. 
  Due to fear of responsibility, the chetnik duke is erasing 
the chetniks from his political life. He probably thinks that 
by erasing files, he can also erase human memory. 
  The duke has forgotten that he just recently appointed 20 
chetnik dukes. With these appointments, considering some of the 
people from the ranks of the new dukes, Seselj has publicly made 
a laughing stock of the highest chivalrous and spiritual 
attainment that the Serbs have reserved for their historical 
dukes. 
  If Mr. Seselj is not ashamed of his actions before the 
domestic and foreign public and the thousands of members of the 
chetnik movement, he should be ashamed before the dead Serbian 
patriots, disabled veterans, war orphans, and the Serbian 
mothers and sisters shrouded in black. 
  The Serbian Radicals from Montenegro and the Serbian 
Radicals, even though they believe that political parties do not 
have the right to claim the chetnik movement, will never 
renounce this national and patriotic organization of the Serbian 
people, ends the statement of the two parties signed by Radovan 
Bukcevic and Zvezdan Babovic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev by Nevena </F>
Petrova; place and date not given: "No Deputy Will Be Held 
Responsible for Corruption as Long as He Is Protected by 
Immunity"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Petrova] What prevents us 
from being more successful? 
  [Zhelev] The reforms are not being implemented. Until now 
the land could have been returned five times. 
  [Petrova] Who is responsible for this, Mr. President? 
  [Zhelev] The executive power is responsible. Three 
governments wasted their time and did not accomplish anything. 
According to my assessment, the land that Berov's government 
really returned amounts to only 10 percent. What DURZHAVEN 
VESTNIK published about the land that has really been returned 
does not correspond to the truth. (Editorial note: According 
to the most recent data published by the National Statistics 
Institute, previous owners have claimed 52,520,000 decares of 
agrarian land. Some 28,877,000 decares have been returned to 
private owners, and this represents 47.4 percent of the total 
land that has been claimed.) What the newspaper refers to is 
rather acknowledging ownership without issuing an appropriate 
document or determining the borders of the plots. 
  [Petrova] Will returning the land, a reform to which you 
attribute great importance, really stimulate the development of 
our economy? 
  [Zhelev] Naturally, there will be only a few people who will 
be able to establish solid agrarian companies. In the next 5-10 
years in Bulgaria the cooperative form will be the dominating 
one. 
  [Petrova] Mr. President, after this somber assessment of 
what has been achieved in the last four years, what is your 
forecast regarding the cabinet's fate after the Easter recess? 
  [Zhelev] I refrain from any forecast. This is a complex 
issue. 
  [Petrova] What makes you uneasy and prevents you from 
answering? 
  [Zhelev] This is the business of the parliament. We are a 
constitutional state, despite the fact that our constitution is 
not perfect. 
  [Petrova] Does Bulgaria need a new or a reshuffled 
government? 
  [Zhelev] I refrain from answering, but I think that 
reshuffling the government is not the correct road. We must 
have early elections. 
  [Petrova] When do you think the Bulgarians will be ready to 
head for the polling stations? 
  [Zhelev] (laughing) If you want to wait for the Bulgarians 
to be ready for new elections.... Even when the mandate of this 
cabinet expires the Bulgarians will not be ready for new 
elections. 
  [Petrova] Then? 
  [Zhelev] The parliament members will not want to lose their 
privileges -- salaries, Mercedes cars, immunity, and influence 
over the mass media. The trade unions, the extraparliamentary 
forces, and public opinion must be activated. They must prepare 
the ground for early elections. Otherwise the current 
parliament will do everything possible to reproduce itself. 
  This also is the reason why the parliament refuses to 
dissolve during the two months that precede the elections. No 
deputy will be held responsible for corruption as long as he is 
protected by immunity. 
  [Petrova] Is it true that you will personally support the 
candidacy of Dimitur Ludzhev as prime minister of a caretaker or 
normal cabinet? 
  [Zhelev] Ludzhev is not interested in being the prime 
minister in a caretaker cabinet. This will be the most stupid 
thing he could do, namely, to waste his possibility to enter the 
parliament because of serving 2-3 months as the head of a 
caretaker cabinet. I think that Dimitur Ludzhev is a capable 
politician. He could achieve a lot if he has a stable team. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Petrova] Mr. President, who is the greatest criminal in 
Bulgaria? 
  [Zhelev] (laughing) Not I.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Nikolay Vasilev, chairman of the </F>
Alternative Social Liberal Party, by Elizabet Dafinova; place 
and date not given: "We Will Not Support a Government With a 
`Pirinski' Program"] 
  [Text] [Dafinova] Professor Vasilev, does the ASP 
[Alternative Social Liberal Party] feel the DPS [Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms] has deceived it, after everything that has 
happened? 
  [Vasilev] One cannot compare interparty relations with 
relations between personalities. Nevertheless, I would like to 
say that the joint meeting of the NSD [New Alliance for 
Democracy] and DPS parliamentary group decided to walk out of 
parliament if Prof. Berov starts talking about specific 
structural changes but then fails to do anything about it. I 
think it is senseless for us to meet and adopt decisions if they 
are not fulfilled. 
  [Dafinova] What will [Industry] Minister Bikov do now? Will 
he follow Karabashev, as the ASP has recommended, or will he 
rely on someone else's support -- perhaps the DPS? 
  [Vasilev] Minister Bikov's seat is firm. If he wants to 
stay in the cabinet, it is certain he will do so. However, if 
the government fails to change its formula and its economic 
policy, we will not only withdraw our support, but will also 
cease to take part in the government. From this point on, the 
problem is a personal one. Bikov must decide himself what to do. 
  [Dafinova] At the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] rally on 1 
May, Zhan Videnov said that he gives this cabinet another 30-40 
days. Some people drew a connection with Valentin Karabashev's 
gesture and predict that the ex-deputy prime minister will be 
the next prime minister. Is this possible? With whose support 
will this happen, with the help of the BSP? 
  [Vasilev] Naturally, Valentin Karabashev may become the next 
prime minister, but it may also be someone else. As far as I am 
concerned, this government is already finished. The government 
that we supported until now was different, with a different 
program. We will not support a government with a "Pirinski" 
program. I hope the DPS will also understand this, that it is 
not merely a matter of certain personnel changes, but of changes 
in the government's policies. The government has started 
carrying out a communist economic program. The Communists' 
claims have gone beyond all reason. 
  [Dafinova] Nonetheless, is the ASP considering continuing 
its talks about the cabinet with the other political forces? 
  [Vasilev] The NSD parliamentary group has reached a firm 
decision that from now on it will not negotiate with either the 
BSP or Berov's government. We will hold the door open only for 
the DPS and SDS, and for the individual SDS parties, of course.

<F P=106> [KONTINENT staff report] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday the leaders of the ASP [Alternative 
Social Liberal Party] issued a reminder that the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] and DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] 
deputies could not muster 121 votes, the minimum needed for 
parliament to adopt decisions. ASP Organizational Secretary 
Vasil Velinov said that if Berov gives in to all the BSP's 
demands for cabinet changes, he will have to propose them in a 
half-empty chamber, thus delivering an unmistakable hint that 
the deputies in the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] group would 
simply boycott parliament if Berov were to reach full accord 
with the Socialists. 
  The ASP leaders have no intention of meeting or holding 
consultations with the BSP or Berov. According to Velinov, with 
the DPS they had merely held "free discussions" that produced no 
concrete results, and that they would have a meeting with the 
Center for New Policy after the latter's national conference in 
Veliko Turnovo at the end of the week. 
  The position of the ASP on whether it would support the 
cabinet and on the forthcoming structural and personnel changes 
in the cabinet should become known after the meeting of the ASP 
Political Council next Tuesday [10 May]. 
  Following a further meeting between Berov and the BSP, it 
became clear that the BSP would find out on Monday how many 
posts it will obtain in the imminent cabinet shuffle. Berov is 
to announce the new names in parliament on Wednesday 11 May. 
Despite having been given a written document explaining the 
concept behind the cabinet changes, the Socialist leadership is 
reportedly not satisfied and has established differences in 
principle with Berov's intentions. At their last meeting with 
Berov, the BSP leaders reported did not accept the prime 
minister's idea of converting the power industry and forestry 
committees into ministries and of merging the tourism and trade 
departments.

<F P=106> ["F.Z."-signed interview with Ferenc Gazdag, director of the </F>
Strategic and Defense Research Institute; place and date not 
given: "We Must Increase Our Military Budget"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [PESTI HIRLAP] How regular 
are your contacts with the Defense Ministry? How often does the 
Defense Ministry request analyses from your institute? 
  [Gazdag] Unfortunately, the system of bilateral relations 
has not yet fully developed. We prepare an annual work program 
and then all the ministry departments and state secretaries 
approve it. So, we have an accepted plan based partly on the 
type of research needed by the ministry and partly on our own 
offers in various fields. [passage omitted] 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] What research programs are currently under 
way? 
  [Gazdag] I think is it enough for me to only describe the 
major ones. The first such major project comprises the 
prevailing issues of the armed forces of the Hungarian Republic, 
as well as the security of Central Europe and Europe as a whole. 
We are now preparing a conference and a bigger publication 
entitled "The Security of Central Europe 1994." We call the 
third major research trend new challenges, new threats, and new 
risks. We must acknowledge the fact that, although the bipolar 
system has collapsed, the time of large-scale military threats 
is over, and there is no longer a NATO-Warsaw Pact 
confrontation, the world has not become much safer either -- at 
least, not around us. Instead of a big nuclear threat, a lot of 
small but real threats have emerged, including many issues that 
are typically not military in nature; nevertheless, the 
researchers must take them into consideration. The refugee 
issue, for example, is such an issue, and it also has security 
elements. The modernization of military technology and the 
structure of armed forces is the fourth area of our research 
activity. This applies exclusively to the Hungarian Defense 
Forces. We have a fifth area, a new area of research, namely the 
relations between the armed forces and the society. [passage 
omitted] 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] As far as I know, you recently visited 
Ukraine. What experiences did you gather? 
  [Gazdag] Our cooperation is extremely varied, including the 
mutual exchange of research materials, analyses, and studies. 
For example, a delegation of the scientific department of the 
Ukrainian Army General Staff held consultations in Hungary for a 
few days in the autumn of 1993. Reciprocating this meeting, 
Hungarian security policy experts held talks in Kiev on 26-28 
April 1994. A member of the Hungarian delegation, Colonel 
Laszlo Nagy, also held talks with the heads of the International 
Research Institute on Global and Regional Security and the 
military policy advisers of the Ukrainian defense minister. In 
the course of these consultations, our experts learned a lot of 
useful things regarding the security policy situation of Ukraine 
and the state of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. They concluded that 
the situation of Ukraine is extremely difficult: a big drop in 
economic performance, inflation, insolvency, and dependence on 
Russia. However, most of our negotiating partners were slightly 
more optimistic than six months ago. They told us that the drop 
had stopped in some areas and the many crisis situations did not 
break the country up. Inflation has also slowed down a little. 
[passage omitted] 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] In the case of Ukraine, the issue of nuclear 
weapons presents a separate problem. 
  [Gazdag] That is true. The tripartite 
Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. agreement signed in January, an agreement 
on Kiev joining the START I agreement, diffused the fears. Two 
shipments of nuclear warheads have been sent to Russia since 
then, and Ukraine received the nuclear fuel for its power 
stations. Kiev took it upon itself to dismantle its nuclear 
devices at a rate stipulated by the START agreement. At the 
same time, Ukraine does not yet intend to join the 
nonproliferation agreement, although the initial antipathy 
toward this agreement seems to be decreasing. It is possible 
that Ukraine will reexamine its position in the near future. 
There is yet another factor in the Ukrainian policy regarding 
the issue of nuclear weapons. In connection with the tripartite 
agreement signed in Moscow, there is a Ukrainian concept that 
seems to be spreading among the military policy experts. 
According to this concept, only the mediation of a third party 
can lead to progress in solving the existing conflicting issues 
between Ukraine and Russia. The supporters of this concept 
would like to include a third party in the ongoing debate on 
Crimea and the Black Sea fleet. The United States would be the 
ideal third party but, if it does not accept this mission, the 
United Nations or other international organizations could also 
be considered. This concept is dangerous inasmuch as Ukraine 
might try to force Washington to join the Ukrainian-Russian 
debate by delaying the dismantling of its nuclear weapons. 
Although the United States repeatedly declared that it does not 
allow itself to be blackmailed, one cannot exclude the 
possibility that Kiev will turn to this doubtful method to 
achieve its goals. Such a step would considerably destabilize, 
first of all, Russian-Ukrainian relations, and this would also 
affect Hungary. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Romania, together with eight other Central and 
Eastern European countries, yesterday became an associate member 
of the Western European Union [WEU]. In accordance with the new 
statute, which is included in the political document adopted at 
the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Union that took 
place in Luxembourg, these nine associate members will regularly 
participate in the meetings of the Council, will be able to 
attend meetings of certain working groups of the organization, 
and will have a permanent connection with the central planning 
body of the WEU in Brussels. 
  Similarly, according to reports by our correspondent Andrei 
Barsan, the countries in Central Europe will be able to 
participate in peacekeeping operations or military activities 
initiated by the WEU. 
  Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who attended the 
meeting together with Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca, 
stressed the importance of yesterday's decision, noting that it 
is the first time that an established security structure in 
Western Europe is opening up to other countries as well. 
  Similarly, Melescanu said that for Romania the act of 
becoming an associate member of the WEU -- that is, the armed 
wing of the European Union and at the same time the European 
pillar of NATO -- reflects the steady efforts of the Romanian 
Government to achieve integration into all European structures 
and recognition of the path traveled by our country, as our 
country has recuperated certain arrears in a spectacular way 
compared with other countries in the region as far as 
integration is concerned.

  [Excerpts] The Czech Republic gained associate 
partner status in the West European Union [WEU] today. This took 
place at a session of a WEU consultative forum which was 
attended by Foreign Affairs Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys. Our special correspondent Klara 
Stejskalova reports from Luxembourg: 
  [Stejskalova] The WEU is the only European organization with 
authority on security questions. It brings together 10 
countries of the European Twelve. The countries of eastern and 
central Europe -- that is, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, 
Romania, and the three Baltic republics, apart from the Czech 
Republic -- have so far had observer status only. Associate 
partner status means, according to Jozef Zieleniec, that our 
contact with the WEU will cease to be diplomatic and will become 
a working one. This means that we are becoming more and more a 
part of the mechanism of European integration. He said the WEU 
will now become an organization that will gradually take over 
the role of security guarantor in Europe. 
  Today can be marked as significant. At last we can 
participate, by our vote, in formulating various aspects of 
policy; for example, a center for planning European identity has 
been formed, among other things. [passage omitted] 
  On the other hand one has to admit that the associate 
countries can take part in discussions, but cannot block 
decisions. Associate status is thus, to some extent, a mere 
formality which certainly does not mean an increase in our 
security.

<F P=106> [Report by "U.K." and "F.N.": "200 Billion Dollar Goal; </F>
East-West Business Forum"] 
  [Text] Countries undergoing reforms should create 
favorable conditions for foreign investors, while the West 
should open up its markets to merchandise from the East -- this 
is what was stressed during the first day of the meeting by 
participants of an East-West Business Forum being held in 
Warsaw. 
  The forum was organized in connection with a third 
conference 
by economy, industry, and trade ministers of the seven most 
industrialized countries of the world (G-7) and of 10 countries 
undergoing reforms (E-10) [E-10: Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech 
Republic, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, 
Ukraine, Hungary], which begins on 6 May. "We are eager to see 
the participation of foreign capital not just in bilateral joint 
venture-type measures but also in multilateral ties. We are 
counting on capital involvement in the amount of over $1 billion 
per year. There cannot be a good economy without a stable 
economic policy, and this is exactly the kind of policy that the 
current government intends to implement, while creating the 
right climate for conducting profitable business," stated Deputy 
Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, who is participating in the 
forum. According to Kolodko, Poland has already achieved 
significant economic results while the economy has good 
prospects for development. 
  During a discussion, the entrepreneurs were wondering what 
must be done to make $200 billion worth of capital flow from the 
G-7 countries to the E-10 countries by the year 2000. By that 
time, the private sector in the countries undergoing reforms 
should produce 70 percent of the national product while the 
participation of these countries in trade exchange with G-7 
should reach the level of 17-20 percent (right now, it is just 
6-7 percent). 
  High customs duties, lack of stability of legal systems, and 
weak promotion all make trade difficult, and they are not 
conducive to investments which are required, among others, in 
telecommunications, transportation, and road construction -- the 
businessmen stressed. 
  NOWA EUROPA asked the U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald H. Brown 
what he expects from the conference, which is to begin Friday. 
"I expect," he said, "that this third conference on East-West 
cooperation will concentrate primarily on working out strategies 
within which the private sector will be able to contribute to 
the region's development to a larger extent than now, and also 
will contribute to the process of establishing new jobs. I 
would like to emphasize that Central and East Europe remains a 
very important and strategic region to us, particularly from the 
standpoint of the transformations taking place in the 
postcommunist countries. We think that the region also has a 
huge economic potential which the countries of East and Central 
Europe are trying to utilize in their striving for a market 
economy. The United States and all highly industrialized 
countries that are members of G-7 can help in this economic 
transformation."

  [Text] Ljubljana, May 9 (TANJUG) -- Slovenian Internal 
Affairs Ministry Monday denied reports that an Italian court had 
ordered the seizure of a ship being built at the Viareggio 
shipyard for Slovenian police. The ministry said the ship had 
been paid for, but that its agent -- which is in financial 
difficulties -- did not pay the entire amount of over three 
million German marks to the shipyard. A Slovenian police 
spokesman said that the Italian court had seized the vessel from 
the shipyard due to the debt, and that Slovenia would get it 
when it is finished. The ship is to be the first war vessel of 
the Slovenian Army. It is believed that this issue could 
aggravate the already tense relations between Slovenia and 
Italy, characterized by many disputes such as the issue of the 
border demarcation between Italy and this former western 
Yugoslav republic. 
  There have been growing though as yet unofficial demands in 
Italy for a revision of borders, with the explanation that the 
demarcation agreement now in force had been signed with the 
former Yugoslav Federation and not with Slovenia. An article 
carried by the IL PICCOLO daily warns that the vessel in 
question is not a police patrol boat but a real war vessel 
equipped with seven radars, underwater television cameras, 
infrared viewing systems and other sophisticated equipment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Entry in Macedonia for </F>
Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] Radio Belgrade reports that the president of the 
Democratic Association of Serbs in Macedonia, Bora Ristic, has 
invited the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (presently visiting Belgrade), to visit 
the Serbs in "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM]." In his interview for Radio Skopje, Ristic said 
"Zhirinovskiy's behavior is quite interesting, some even say 
extreme. As he is visiting Yugoslavia at the moment, we invited 
him as an ordinary citizen, to get directly acquainted with his 
philosophy and views on the Balkan region. But, I believe 
chances are he will not be able to come, as the Bolsheviks in 
Belgrade, and I do not think these Bolsheviks in Macedonia are 
any better, have deprived him of the right to publicly appear in 
Belgrade." 
  Radio Skopje unofficially informs that the Macedonian 
authorities are not inclined to grant Zhirinovskiy entry and 
stay in the country. The A1 television finds out Zhirinovskiy 
had planned to arrive in Macedonia at the Skopje airport. The 
airport authorities were allegedly ordered not to allow 
Zhirinovskiy to set foot on Macedonia territory. A1 reports 
that the air companies have also brought a decision not to allow 
Zhirinovskiy to board any of their planes flying on 
international routes.

<F P=106> [News conference by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman with </F>
foreign and domestic correspondents at the Presidential Palace 
in Zagreb -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, some 
progress seems to have been made at the talks in Vienna. Is 
your visit to Sarajevo linked with the outcome of the talks? 
  [Tudjman] I believe that the two delegations will reach an 
agreement on the implementation of the Washington agreement. My 
visit to Sarajevo does not depend [Tudjman laughs] on the Vienna 
talks. It depends on technical reasons. As you know, I am 
ready and I was ready to go but this depends on UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] and other factors. 
  [Al-Isa] Nada Al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio-Television. 
Mr. President, Croatian press has carried a statement by 
Kresimir Zubak [Bosnian Croat leader] in Vienna. I am confused 
by what Mr. Zubak said: That Mostar will be the most difficult 
issue as far as borders between cantons are concerned. I am 
asking you this because so far Mostar was supposed to be under 
EU administration as a single city. 
  [Tudjman] I do not know about this statement by Zubak. Of 
course Mostar should be under EU administration, but it should 
also be the capital of the Herzegovina canton, i.e., of the 
grand county of Herzegovina. This is probably being discussed 
now and I believe that the delegations will reach an agreement. 
  [Rexepi] Adrijana Rexepi, Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, in 
an interview for Pristina's ZERI, Josip Manolic, the chairman of 
the Chamber of Counties, commented on a statement you made three 
years ago that Kosovo was Serbia's internal problem. Manolic 
said that this was part of a deal you made with President 
Milosevic and that since then Albanians in Croatia could not 
regulate their documents and their status. Can you tell us what 
all this is really about? 
  [Tudjman] It is about a basic principle according to which 
the status of all ethnic groups in certain states should be 
solved within those states in line with international 
conventions. Nothing else is involved. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] of the 
Russian 
news agency ITAR-TASS. Mr. President, the situation near Brcko 
is very tense. What is your prediction? Is this area really 
going to be decisive for the war in Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, the situation around Brcko does give cause 
for 
genuine concern. But in view of the open involvement by the 
international community, including the United Nations, I believe 
that the complications of war [zapetljaji rata] will be avoided. 
This is, however, not totally certain but I personally expect 
that if the Serb forces launch their offensive the international 
community and the United Nations will respond in a more resolute 
way than has been the case so far. 
  [Baratez] Mr. President, Zeljko Baratez, GLAS SLAVONIJE: Is 
Croatia going to do something to stop the further export of oil 
from Djeletovci [Serb-held oil field in eastern Slavonija] and 
to prevent the aggressor from destroying the evidence of his 
crimes in eastern Slavonija? We know that they have been 
filling up mass graves with soil and taking bones elsewhere. 
Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] Croatia will continue to place firmer demands 
before the international community on the way UN Security 
Council resolutions should be implemented unless the Serb side 
shows readiness to adhere to the agreement on normalizing 
relations, normalizing Croat-Serb relations within Croatia and 
on normalizing relations between Croatia and Serbia. In other 
words, if there is no sign of their readiness -- and so far we 
have unfortunately had no such signs -- Croatia will 
understandably take steps at a diplomatic level and elsewhere to 
ensure that the issues you raised are tackled and that there is 
a speedy integration into the constitutional and legal system of 
Croatia of the Croatian areas now under the protection of the 
peace forces, or rather under Serbian occupation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, how do you 
comment on parliamentary events and what will happen at the 
forthcoming session? Will Mesic and Manolic resign and who will 
replace them? 
  [Tudjman] One thing should be clear about the events in 
parliament. Attempts by those who wanted to create a 
parliamentary and a constitutional crisis failed. This was the 
goal of Mesic and Manolic when they formed their new party. The 
Croatian Democratic Union remains a majority party, with an 
absolute majority in both chambers of parliament. It can be 
expected that this so-called parliamentary crisis will be solved 
in a democratic, parliamentary manner. Croatia is organized as 
a state with a multiparty parliament, and according to all 
parliamentary and multiparty principles the chairmen of the 
chambers [Mesic and Manolic] must be from the ranks of the party 
that has the majority in parliament. It is normal to expect 
Mesic and Manolic to accept the democratic principles and that 
an agreement will be reached through a parliamentary debate 
between party representatives. This should be solved in a 
parliamentary, democratic, civilized manner and, of course, if 
this should not be the case the majority party can make certain 
changes in line with the Constitution -- changes that serve to 
preserve a democratic, parliamentary system. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, will the kuna 
[new Croatian currency] be introduced on the occasion of 
Statehood Day [30 May], and can you tell us more about the name 
kuna [marten]? Many say that that was the name of the currency 
used during the NDH [Neovisna Drzava Hrvatska -- Independent 
State of Croatia during World War II] and stress its' 
association with the then Fascist regime. Mr. Manolic even 
said: Why not call it the zec [rabbit] or the lisica [fox]? 
  [Tudjman, laughing] Well, I honestly have neither read about 
nor heard that piece of witticism. I know that when we 
discussed the name of the Croatian currency there were people 
who were against it. However, following the very serious debate 
we had in both political and scientific circles we decided to 
give the name kuna to the Croatian currency. Why? Well, 
because the animal was used for payments in kind from the 11th 
century. If I am not mistaken, the name kuna was first 
mentioned in documents as a means of payment in kind in 1018. 
It was used throughout Croatia, and not just in Slavonia but 
right down to the island of Cres. Also, another point: Marten 
was used as the means of payment in kind in a large part of the 
world, from Russia to Canada. Marten was not just used for 
payments in kind but also as a currency. There are documents 
that indicate that in the 13th century the fur of one marten was 
equal to 10 dinars. In addition, the majority of European 
currency names, such as the Latin currency and the English 
pound, the German mark, and the Italian and French currencies 
date back to barter trade. 
  So, by naming our currency after what was used in Croatia as 
means of payment in kind we are merely following the European 
tradition in naming national currencies. 
  Such a statement -- that the currency should be called the 
zec or the lisica -- is slightly surprising, and dare I say 
frightening -- coming as it did from people who frequently 
appear on the political scene, since these names have no 
historical background while the name kuna has. It is even more 
surprising that statements against the kuna have come from 
university professors. 
  In other words, kuna [the animal] was not just a means of 
payment in kind but was also depicted on Croatian money during 
the Croatian-Hungarian union, on its coins. The kuna is on the 
coat of arms of one of the three Croatian kingdoms, i.e. of the 
kingdom of Slavonia -- there is a kuna on the coat of arms of 
the kingdom of Slavonia. At some stage in history the kingdom 
of Slavonia was synonymous with Croatia. Consequently, linking 
the kuna only with the NDH is not wise at all. On the contrary, 
it shows petty politics and an attempt to discredit the Croatian 
democratic authorities. 
  Speaking about that, we should remember that after its 
establishment in 1939, the Province of Croatia [Croatian part of 
the Kingdom of Yugoslavia] also wanted to introduce a Croatian 
currency and planned to call it kuna. Artist Kerbic made 
prototypes of the currency called kuna or banica, but all this 
did not happen because the then Croatian political authorities 
were not sovereign, and there were conflicts about the currency 
issue. 
  When we discussed the problem of naming the new Croatian 
currency we considered all that. We considered the tendency in 
Europe and Croatia to develop the names of national currencies. 
We concluded that there was no reason why nowadays, when we 
have an independent, sovereign, autonomous Croatian 
state...[pauses] that today we can give the Croatian currency 
the name that has the greatest tradition in Croatia as a means 
of payment both in kind and as a currency. The fact that the 
name was in use during the Second World War in a Quisling regime 
that functioned within Hitler's new European order -- other 
European countries now also have currencies that they had 
before, during the Second World War. 
  When we created the independent sovereign Croatia, we wanted 
finally to give the right name to the Croatian national 
currency. All the more so because that name is very easy to 
pronounce here and abroad and because it is unique. There is no 
name similar to that. When for a while we considered the name 
kruna [crown], we concluded that we are not a kingdom -- after 
the loss of the medieval kingdom we had no independent Croatian 
kingdom -- and that there are many currencies called kruna in 
Europe -- Czech, Norwegian, Swedish, and all sorts of krunas in 
Europe. The kuna will be the unique Croatian currency. 
  Consequently, all historic and political reasons were in 
favor of the name kuna. We thus displayed political and 
national maturity, and the determination to defend our historic 
traditions and the interests of the sovereignty of the Croatian 
nation. 
  Academician Brozovic is preparing a special monograph on 
that 
issue -- I think it will be published soon. All this will be 
explained. I believe that we can be happy and proud that we are 
introducing a new Croatian currency along our true traditions, 
and also in line with the tradition of naming national 
currencies in European countries. 
  [Segoje] Zvonimir Segoje, Hrvatski Vjesnik, Vinkovci and 
Zadar. When the war ends with Serbia's military defeat, Serbia 
will have to pay reparations. It is obvious that they [the 
Serbs] will not be able to pay. Serbia set an example [of 
getting reparations paid in some other way] when it got the area 
of Stubica from Bulgaria after the First World War, instead of 
the reparations. We respect the post-Second-World-War borders, 
whereby the historic Srijem and Boka Kotorska are outside of 
Croatia. Will we ask for Srijem, Boka Kotorska, and perhaps a 
part of Backa instead of the reparations? 
  [Tudjman] The reparations would certainly be justified for 
historic and other reasons. But, we also must bear in mind that 
we are living in a different world today. We are living in a 
world where the new order that is being created does not accept 
violent changes of state borders. This world wants to secure, 
within existing states, national rights for other nations and 
national minorities. I am afraid that we would not get any 
support for such demands in the present democratic world, that 
we could cause unwanted consequences. But, Croatia will 
certainly bear in mind the destruction that was done, it will 
bear in mind its rights and will set some demands before the 
international community, which we think are justified and for 
which Croatia could get support from the international community 
in which we have to live. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I presume that you know what is 
happening at the Vienna talks. It has been reported that some 
kind of result will be achieved by 1400. Can you confirm this, 
and is it true that the issue of who will be the president of 
Bosnia in the first 12 months is an obstacle for the talks? 
  [Tudjman] I believe that the delegations will find a 
solution, as I have said. As far as the main issues regarding 
the setting up of the federation and the confederation [of 
Bosnia and Croatia], the issue of who will get the top posts, 
should not be vital. However, what is vital is to immediately 
start implementing the principles we have agreed upon at the 
talks we have had so far, including the Washington agreement we 
signed. This agreement says that the prime minister and the 
president of the federation cannot belong to the same nation in 
the same term. Therefore, the Croats are not making any 
exclusive demands. The Croatian delegation just wants the 
agreement -- the agreement that was reached under the auspices 
of the United States and the international community, they want 
the agreement and its implementation to be respected. 
  I believe -- and as far as I know from the reports last 
night 
-- I believe that the agreement has been reached. 
  [Heinrich] President Tudjman, I am Mark Heinrich from 
REUTER. 
Can you tell us, according to your information, how many 
deputies from the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] have joined 
the new party set up by Mesic and Manolic, and do you think that 
more deputies will change party ranks? 
  [Tudjman] According to evidence so far, of 85 HDZ deputies 
in 
the Chamber of Deputies, seven joined Mesic and Manolic. 
Therefore, that does not bring into question the absolute 
majority of the HDZ in the Croatian Parliament. According to 
parliamentary principles, even the party that has a relative, 
rather than an absolute majority, has the right to appoint the 
presidents of the assembly chambers, that is, to have 
proportional influence in the parliament. 
  Consequently, precisely because we cannot even speak about a 
rift in the majority party, but only about the departure of 
several deputies, I think that the changes caused by this will 
be dealt with at the next session in a normal, democratic way. 
As I said before, I expect -- and there are indications that an 
agreement will be reached between the heads of parliamentary 
delegations in the Assembly, and that this will be carried out 
in the usual parliamentary fashion. After all, those gentlemen 
always invoke democracy and democratic principles, so we can 
expect that they will abide by those principles. 
  All the more so because we live at a time -- you raised the 
question of a possible war around Brcko, so it is possible that 
the situation will further deteriorate in that area -- when we 
need a stable constitutional and political system in Croatia. 
The question inevitably arises as to who would need the 
destabilization of the democratic Croatia, the destabilization 
of the Croatia that the world, Europe, the United States, and 
the international community need as a stable country. 
Therefore, I expect that in this context this problem will be 
solved in a normal democratic way. 
  [Modric] Sanja Modric, Novi List. Mr. President, this year 
you took part in the 1 May celebrations in the Maksimir park, 
which was very well received by the people. Do you perhaps 
intend to take part in the celebration of [the anniversary] 9 
May at the Square of the Croatian Great today, organized by 
several associations of citizens? 
  [Tudjman] No, I personally will not be there. But, my 
participation in Maksimir was not a gesture of particular 
importance, I have been to Maksimir before. That was the Labor 
Day of all citizens of the world, and also of Croatian citizens. 
I am, of course, the president of all Croats and all [Croatian] 
citizens, regardless of their party allegiance. Croatia will 
continue to function this way in future. 
  [Correspondent] [name indistinct], HTV [Croatian TV]. I 
would like to refer back to the Square of the Croatian Great. 
Recently there has been an increasing number of demands to 
change the name of the square back to its original name -- the 
Square of the Victims of Fascism. Can you give us your comment 
on this? 
  [Tudjman] Well, such demands have also reached me. It is 
interesting that they were linked with the problem of the kuna, 
which I have already mentioned. No, the Square of the Croatian 
Great will not be renamed again to the Square of the Victim of 
Fascism, because we created the democratic modern Croatia on the 
reconciliation of the divided Croats. If we had left the Square 
of the Victims of Fascism we would have had to rename one of the 
main Zagreb squares the Square of Victims of Communism -- 
because there were no fewer victims of Communism than of Fascism 
in Croatia. 
  Let us build our democratic Croatia on the tradition of both 
anti-Fascism, the Croatian anti-Fascism -- for Croatia gave a 
larger contribution to the anti-Fascist struggle in the Second 
World War than any other peoples of the former 
Yugoslavia...[pauses] But Communism also inflicted a large 
number of victims on Croatia. We were trying to bring together 
the divided, opposed Croats, and through this reconciliation we 
created a democratic, modern Croatia -- and we will continue 
with such a policy, and not divide the people with some squares 
of the victims of Fascism and Communism etc. 
  I have also personally recommended to the mayor of Zagreb to 
call Dotrscina -- an area where Croatian anti-Fascists were 
indeed killed -- the Square or the Field of the Victims of 
Fascism. 
  On the day of our statehood we will inaugurate the monument, 
or rather the Altar of the Croatian Homeland in Medvedgrad. 
This will be a location where we will pay our respects to all 
the victims from our history, regardless of which side they were 
on when they died for Croatia, Croatian freedom, the Croatian 
homeland. 
  [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. We have often 
mentioned the Vienna agreement here. We have said nothing about 
the agreements -- which were set in motion and then stalled, 
stalled quite seriously -- between Croatia and representatives 
of Serbs from the so-called Krajinas. Instead we have witnessed 
situations in which the Croatian Army has fully complied with 
the signed agreements and has withdrawn but the refugees have 
not returned. There is no chance of them returning in the near 
future. What is the obstacle that stalled these negotiations? 
To what extent will they be affected by the latest situation in 
parliament and those negotiators who have been criticized by the 
public? What is the latest situation? What kind of hope can 
refugees have in the light of the current situation? 
  [Tudjman] The latest development is the fact that instead of 
implementing the agreement on normalization and the Serb side's 
political promises that it would embark on normalization, it has 
hardened its' positions to the effect that Krajina is something 
special and that it will no longer be returning to Croatia. 
This is a truly new development. We do take this into account. 
This hardening position has probably emerged in parallel with 
the hardening positions in Bosnia, that is with the open and 
escalating questions in Croatia's occupied areas for as long as 
the Bosnian question remains unsolved. [sentence as heard] 
  We have made it clear, we are still making it clear, both to 
the Serbian side and the international community, that we remain 
committed to the principle of necessary normalization in 
relations, to the need for and the feasibility of a political 
solution. We are, however, not going to tolerate delays in 
resolving the incorporation of the Croatian territories 
protected by the peace force, i.e. under Serbian occupation. We 
must start resolving the problem of enabling the refugees to 
return. If we do not succeed in implementing this agreement on 
normalization with the Serbian side with the help of the United 
Nations and the international community, then we will have, on 
our part, to take every step in order to secure the return of 
refugees and the incorporation of this area into Croatia. Our 
public, as well as the Serbian side and the international public 
must rest assured that we will do so. 
  As far as this question is concerned we will, of course, 
bear 
in mind the question whether those who have negotiated so far 
have fully carried out their task, whether they are trusted by 
the public, as you put it. In any case I have already decided 
that Djordje Pribicevic should take part in the negotiations, 
i.e. take part in the team. It remains to be seen whether there 
will be any other problems. 
  [Ramljak] Is there any chance of people who are real 
refugees 
being directly included in the negotiating team? Perhaps, 
someone who is a member of the refugee community. 
  [Tudjman] If this were purposeful, we could indeed do so. 
Let us be realistic, though, in this respect. Someone from the 
ranks of refugees might represent the interests and views of his 
own area. One should instead resolve these problems as a whole. 
It has turned out that it is impossible to have a large number 
of negotiators because it is impossible to find solutions. 
Understandably, yes, if this were purposeful, if we found such 
a justifiable suggestion accepted by me and the Croatian 
Government. 
  [Ramljak] Excuse me once again, I would like to ask 
something in connection with the last question. Mr. Mikelic 
speaks about a new territorial organization of Krajinas. Mr. 
Martic says that they will defend the Posavina corridor. Mr. 
Prijic says that the line of separation is practically a state 
border. Mikelic says that they have started an economic 
recovery in Krajina. Will the Croatian side take some concrete 
steps if the Serbs move from words to deeds? 
  [Tudjman] I think I answered all your questions a minute 
ago. 
Of course, we must take into consideration these irresponsible 
-- not to say anything worse -- statements by representatives of 
the Knin Serbs. We have pointed out to the international 
community that the problem is in Belgrade, that this is 
Belgrade's occupation -- a Serb, a Yugoslav occupation -- of 
those areas, because they provide them not only with money and 
documents which state that Knin is part of Serbia, but also with 
weapons and so on. In that respect, we will take all measures 
-- both through the international community and internally -- to 
bring such behavior to an end. 
  I repeat, if we fail to achieve a political solution within 
the framework of the agreement on normalization and clear 
statements of all international factors -- from UN Security 
Council resolutions to statements by representatives of the 
world's most important powers from the United States, China, and 
even Russia which recognize Croatia's territorial integrity -- 
then, naturally, Croatia will have to take different steps. 
But, of course, then we will have -- I hope -- the political 
support of the international public, which is not ready to 
accept an armed liberation of those areas prior to all political 
options being exhausted. 
  [Correspondent] [Name indistinct], VECERNJI LIST. You have 
said that seven deputies would follow Manolic and Mesic. You 
have recently said that about 1 percent of the HDZ would leave 
with them. Do you still think the same? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, I do. It is obvious that a bit more than 1 
percent of deputies have left. I still say that not more than 1 
percent of the HDZ members will leave. In turn, a significantly 
larger number will join the HDZ. This is already happening in 
all counties, and in the diaspora. We have received hundreds of 
cables and letters of support for the central HDZ policies and 
the state policy. These messages say that their [Mesic's, 
Manolic's] departure will in fact strengthen the HDZ, its 
central policy adopted at the second HDZ assembly. 
  Among hundreds and hundreds of letters, only one was against 
[the central HDZ policies]. You know what it says, what he [the 
author] finds important! He says: As a HDZ member I also join 
Manolic and Mesic because I cannot accept the decisions of the 
second HDZ assembly, because I cannot accept the new name of the 
Croatian currency, and because I disagree that God Save Croatia 
should be the HDZ anthem. So these are the reasons then 
[Tudjman laughs] why this single one among hundreds of letters 
agrees with Mr. Manolic. I believe that these hundreds of 
letters reflect the general mood, not among hundreds but among 
thousands and tens of thousands of HDZ members and among those 
who are not its members. All this indicates that the HDZ, as the 
central democratic Croatian party, will continue to gain 
strength. 
  [Kuzmanovic] Jasmina Kuzmanovic, AP. Mr. President, last 
week the United Nations explicitly called -- for the first time 
-- on the Bosnian Army to steer clear of the corridor. They 
called on both the Serbs and the Bosnian Army to steer clear of 
the Brcko area. It is a fact that the corridor is vital for the 
Serbs as it links the occupied areas of Bosnia and Croatia to 
Serbia proper. It is also a fact that there have been 
difficulties and problems in the talks between Croatia and 
Serbia and Croatia's Serbs. What is your comment on this move? 
Does this amount to the creation of some new UNPA [UN protected 
area] zone in Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] I believe that, having experienced all their 
bitter 
lessons in seeking a solution to the Bosnian crisis, 
international factors have drawn the conclusion that neither 
side should be allowed to spread the war. After all, the 
Croat-Muslim agreement on cooperation, on the federation and 
confederation, was reached under international supervision so as 
to restore peace as soon as possible rather than to prolong the 
war. Hence, what you have pointed out should be seen from this 
point of view -- the international community will try to prevent 
the war from spreading. In Bosnia itself there is a threat of 
complications on a wider international scale. 
  [Kuzmanovic] As regards the threat of the war spreading -- 
does this in a sense cement their [Serb] gains if they can keep 
this corridor as a protected zone? 
  [Tudjman] No, this does not cement the corridor because the 
international community will not let the Serbs keep all 70 
percent, they [Serbs] even say that they hold as much as 73 
percent of Bosnian territory. Things have been made clear -- 
agreements are being sought on the basis of the agreements 
hitherto reached within the Geneva Conference to the effect that 
the current Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation should get 51 
percent and the Serbs 49 percent. Given the agreement on the 
federation and confederation, not only is this waiting in the 
wings, but the responsible diplomats taking part in this 
conference are saying that the Serbs should pay slightly more 
than this for a solution. 
  Consequently, by no means will the international community 
accept such a territorial solution that will correspond with 
today's real situation. 
  [Veric] Luka Veric. Mr. President, it is a fact that many 
Croatian citizens are leaving the country. Many of them are 
educated young people. A number of ethnic Croats from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are also leaving the country. What is 
Croatia doing to stop this? Is there any interest in this? 
Some people say that we are talking about worrying numbers of 
people leaving. Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] We could say that we should worry about it, but I 
believe that we are not talking about such large numbers. 
Croats are leaving for foreign countries, and young people as 
well, as a result of the war evils that we have experienced, the 
occupation of one quarter of the Croatian territory, and of 
everything that the war imposed on us. 
  Even in normal conditions, insufficiently developed 
countries 
cannot prevent the so-called brain-drain into the more developed 
countries of the world. In Croatian conditions, in such war 
conditions, both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this was 
an inevitable consequence. 
  But at the same time young people are coming back to the 
homeland despite the conditions. I have had a report of some 
100 young people returning. With the creation of a democratic 
Croatia and the economic reforms, with the curbing of inflation 
-- we have already begun the positive process, not only of 
attracting investment from the diaspora and from foreign 
countries, but also of having Croatian people return to the 
homeland. We see such cases on a daily basis. 
  The democratic Croatian authorities must certainly do their 
utmost to stimulate this process as much as possible. When the 
war ends and the problems are resolved, and agreements are 
reached -- like the ones with the United States and the one that 
the prime minister signed in Iran and with some other countries 
-- through the development of political and economic relations 
we will create increasingly favorable conditions to stop our 
people leaving and, on the contrary, to have them return to us. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The allocation of 
socially-owned apartments to high-ranking state officials has 
caused a lot of negative reaction. What do you think about this? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, there are well-justified examples of some 
objections raised as regards this, but there is also a lot of 
political scheming here, and also -- and many people would not 
be aware of this -- a lot of political-psychological warfare 
against a sovereign Croatia. 
  What are we talking about here? We are for a transformation 
from the socialist-type social ownership of apartments into 
private ownership, so that people have the right to buy 
apartments. The right to buy has been given to those who had 
tenancy rights [to live in socially-owned apartments] and to 
those who could pay [for the apartments] in foreign currency. 
In that respect all citizens were in the same position. Those 
who were behind the repressive rule over the Croatian people in 
the former regime and those who were persecuted by the former 
regime because of their democratic and national feelings were in 
the same position regarding this. 
  If there are some irregularities they should be corrected, 
equally for everyone. You are probably aware that I personally, 
on the rare occasion when I chaired a government session -- I 
think in January last year -- chaired a session when the need to 
fight all forms of crime mercilessly was the particular focus of 
attention. The need to fight the remains of the communist 
bureaucratic system and all forms of crime within the new 
democratic system was discussed. 
  But I will tell you that there is a certain lack of 
understanding, and attempts by political schemers to discredit 
the transformation of the former socialist ownership into 
private ownership, and attempts to destabilize the authorities 
in this field. 
  In upcoming days some people will appear before courts who, 
between 1990 and the end of 1991, worked in Croatia in an 
organized and public way against the founding of a democratic 
Croatia and its survival. One of the main aims of their 
activities was to compromise the leading people of the new 
democratic system. This was a part of their organization's 
program, which had the organizational and program name of Opera. 
  Such activities have resumed, in one way or another, until 
today. I can show you on one example how this works in the case 
of apartments. 
  When, after 20 years I got a passport for the first time, so 
that I could travel abroad, I met a young man in Canada in 1987 
among the people of various party and non-party allegiances in 
the Croatian diaspora. I was told he was not interested in 
politics but was very competent in the field of electronics and 
communications, and that many companies -- from Toronto to 
Ottawa and Vancouver -- were headhunting him. I was told he was 
the sort of person Croatia needed. 
  Between 1986 and 1989, that is before the democratic 
Croatian 
authorities were established, I used to send invitations to 
Croatian emigrants, in particular to the young and capable ones, 
to return to the homeland. Ivica Mudrinic was among them. He 
is the one I just spoke about. Ivica Mudrinic returned to the 
country, I do not know how old he (is/was), 35 or 40, with his 
four children. He made his knowledge, ability, and his patents 
available to democratic Croatia, his homeland. What did the 
homeland give him in return? It gave him a tenancy right, the 
same right enjoyed by those who had made him and his father 
flee, who had imprisoned me and others. So, can we say that 
this is an example of crime or dishonesty of the Croatian 
ministers? 
  I am for the remorseless elimination of all forms of crime, 
but I am also for giving a real political and ethic name to each 
phenomenon [as heard], and for seeing what lies behind some 
appearances. 
  I do not know exactly how many tens of thousands of 
apartments we have already sold, and how many there are left to 
be sold. This process should be finalized as soon as possible, 
so that we can implement the denationalization and 
privatization. We will not allow anyone to prevent us from 
doing what we want. We have had over one half of the Croatian 
population living abroad, some people even say that about the 
same number of able-bodied people have left the country as have 
stayed in it. There is no democratic Croatia if there is no 
possibility for these people to return. There are no democratic 
authorities unless the same rights are given to these people as 
to those who have stayed in the country. I am not saying that 
they should have any preferential treatment, but simply the same 
rights. We should make good use of their experience, both 
democratic and technical, technological, scientific. 
  We should stimulate the reconciliation of all citizens of 
Croatia, in the interest of [preserving] what we have already 
achieved -- an independent, internationally recognized Croatia, 
which is not only recognized but also needed by the world for 
the creation of a new democratic order in this part of 
southeastern Europe. In this light our objective is to have a 
legal order of the highest level. What we have written into our 
Constitution and laws -- we will be able to fully implement them 
when the war is really over, when we return 250,000 people -- I 
cannot say to their homes for their homes are destroyed, but to 
their ruined hearths. When we reintegrate all these areas into 
the constitutional and legal system of Croatia, and when we can 
devote ourselves to the economic reconstruction, to the 
scientific and cultural progress in Croatia...[pauses] We must 
consistently and fully direct all our resources for Croatia to 
become a country of freedom and, fully and in every respect, a 
country of legal order. 
  This is something that cannot be secured by any country 
that is drawn into war in one way or another. This is something 
that is illustrated by the case of the United States during its 
war with Japan. It [the U.S.] could not apply, it could not 
comply with the civil rights of Japanese citizens. It had to 
organize collection centers, camps, and confiscate their 
property etc. for national security reasons. There are, 
however, those fools who accuse the Croatian authorities of 
setting up the camps in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Croats did 
not set them up first because the Croats had to fight there, 
first against the Serb aggression. They had to survive. 
Consequently, every phenomenon should be assessed in the light 
of the exact circumstances in which the democratic Croatia was 
created, defended, and consolidated. 
  [Janacek] Janacek, [word indistinct] Mr. President, Mr. 
Veljko Knezevic, the official representative of the authorities 
in Belgrade said in an interview to the HRT [Croatian Radio and 
TV] to our colleague Rajic; he used the term Republic of Serb 
Krajina as he was talking about Croatia's occupied areas. Can 
Croatia tolerate the fact that the official representative of a 
country that has not recognized the statehood of that area -- 
although it itself has not been recognized -- can freely voice 
such statements? Or perhaps, he has permission for such 
statements? 
  [Tudjman] I believe that, officially, Croatia cannot 
tolerate 
such statements. If this representative -- who arrived under 
the agreement on the normalization of relations, which implies 
the recognition of Croatia within its borders -- were to 
continue to air such statements, not only in our country, I 
believe, he would have to stop enjoying our hospitality.

  [Text] The talks between the delegations of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia are continuing in Vienna today on 
the implementation of the Constitution of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Details concerning the borders of the 
Herzegovina cantons are to be worked out today. Last night our 
delegation put forward several proposals as to possible 
solutions, after which the Croatian delegation asked for a break 
in order to conduct additional consultations. Even though these 
are delicate matters, the delegations are expected to complete 
this part of the job today, and then approach the agreement 
concerning the package, which includes the number and borders of 
the cantons, and the distribution of the ministerial positions 
in the government and the functions in the federation.

  [Text] Belgrade, 9 May (TANJUG) -- The Serb National 
Renewal Party [SNO] organized a rally in Belgrade's Republic 
Square. Among others the gathering was addressed by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, president of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR]. SNO representatives pointed out that the meeting 
was organized to mark the 49th anniversary of the victory 
against fascism and as a harbinger of the upcoming Serbian 
victory. 
  Addressing the rally, Zhirinovskiy said that Russia would 
get 
a new government and a new president soon. "The day after we 
will renew all our relations with Yugoslavia and Serbia, sending 
you all necessary aid, including military aid," Zhirinovskiy 
said. 
  According to him, a new holiday will be marked soon -- "the 
day when the last foreign soldier left the Balkans, the day when 
sanctions against Yugoslavia are suspended." Zhirinovskiy said 
that if representatives of the Serbian nation ask the Russian 
Parliament for aid, "hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers 
would soon arrive in the Balkans." 
  Expressing his opinion that the conflict in the Balkans 
could 
escalate, Zhirinovskiy said that "If NATO and the Muslim world 
begin a third world war" the Slavs would celebrate 9 May in the 
future "in all Western cities," while all capitals of NATO 
members "would be dealt with in the same way as with Berlin in 
1945." 
  He pointed out that the Russians do not have to fight. "We 
will just let our defective nuclear submarines sail toward the 
West and that will be the end of Western Europe," Zhirinovskiy 
said.

  [Text] Tirana, May 9 (ATA) -- The Albanian Christian 
Democratic Party [PDK] supports the statement of the Democratic 
Party branch of Kukes and considers most of the demands of the 
displaced families as a result of the construction of hydro 
power stations, as legitimate and realisable, a press release of 
this party says. "But it asks these families not to allow that 
their economic problems and demands be manipulated by those who 
have been the real authors of their drama and who are now 
pouring crocodile tears." 
  It says that the blocking of the roads and occupation of 
state buildings are acts which only intend to give political 
colour to the just economic demands of the removed families. 
Also, it asks the representatives of these families and strikers 
to define the ways of solving these demands through dialogue 
with the government and in a constructive spirit. It also asks 
the government to adopt all measures to accelerate the drafting 
and application of the aid program for the removed families and 
solve their problems, the statement concludes.

  [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The talks between British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Prague today and yesterday 
have shown the closeness of opinion that exists between the 
Czech Republic and Great Britain, Hurd told a press conference 
today at the end of his meeting with Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec. 
  Both countries were sharing in the unification of Europe, he 
emphasized -- in the ensuring of security, in political dialogue 
and in the development of trade. The Czech Republic was an 
important part of this process, Hurd said. As far as its 
journey to the "European family" was concerned, the Czech 
Republic was cooperating with its neighbors, but when it came to 
membership of NATO and the European Union, it was proceeding 
individually, he added. 
  Hurd said that his talks with Zieleniec and Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus has shown that the two countries had similar 
opinions on the future development and shape of the European 
Union. Both of them believed in free trade leading to improved 
living standards, and in the identity of nation states, not in 
the subjugation of national identities to some sort of "European 
superstate." 
  There had been progress in trade between the Czech Republic 
and Britain, Hurd said, but "it was not enough." He believed 
that British trade and investments in the Czech Republic had to 
be supported. 
  Zieleniec praised Britain's role in promoting the 
integration 
of Central Europe into the European Union, and above all Hurd's 
personal efforts. There had been much discussion between him 
and Hurd of the significance of free trade in European 
integration, Zieleniec said. They had agreed that the 
liberalization of world trade was valuable in itself, and that 
new protectionism could not be camouflaged with fictions about 
social dumping and so on. 
  Zieleniec also expressed his pleasure at the British support 
of Czech membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD). "For us becoming part of an organization 
which unites the developed countries of the West is of not only 
practical, but also symbolic significance," Zieleniec said.

  [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and 
Britain agree that the question of stability of Central and 
Eastern Europe is important for the continent, but differ in the 
accent on what is the cause and what is the consequence, Czech 
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told CTK today. He was 
referring to his talks with British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd earlier today during which the European security and 
stability pact was also taken up. 
  An international conference on the pact will be held in 
Paris 
at the end of May. The pact, proposed by French Premier Edouard 
Balladur last June, is to ensure stability and security in 
Europe, protect economic and trade interests, and result in the 
conclusion of agreements on good neighborhood and respect for 
the rights of ethnic minorities. 
  Zieleniec said all European countries, including the Czech 
Republic, espoused the goals set by the European Union (EU) -- 
finding a way of making Central and Eastern Europe a genuine 
part of the continent and gradually integrating it into the EU. 
  He stressed that views on ways of achieving these goals were 
not always entirely identical. The Czech Republic stresses the 
Western experience that the problems of ethnic minorities are 
best solved within a democratic and law-abiding state which has 
a well functioning economy based on private ownership. 
  Zieleniec said it was very difficult to treat the minority 
issue as an isolated one in a multilateral international 
agreement, without stressing the need for democracy and a 
law-abiding state.

  [Text] Luxembourg, May 9 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and 
eight other Central and Eastern European countries were today 
granted associate membership of the Western European Union 
(WEU). This allows the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, 
Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia access 
to the regular twice monthly WEU delegates' meetings in Brussels 
and to send soldiers to peace keeping operations, but does not 
give them security guarantees or the right of veto. 
  The Czech Republic was represented at today's ceremony by 
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys. At the meeting Zieleniec said he welcomed the fact that 
after the NATO summit (at which the Partnership for Peace 
project was approved) the WEU had come up with an initiative 
that would bring the Czech Republic closer to the process of 
building an European defense identity. The Czech Republic felt 
the same responsibility for the safety of the continent as the 
West did, he added. 
  He later told journalists that from now on contacts with the 
WEU would stop being merely diplomatic and would take on a 
working character. The WEU was gradually changing into the 
military pillar of Europe, Zieleniec said. 
  After the ceremony Zieleniec met his French counterpart 
Alain 
Juppe. They exchanged views on the preparation for the 
forthcoming meeting on the proposed stability pact in Paris, 
agreeing that it was vitally important that the meeting should 
take place and produce positive results for European security.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 7 (CTK) -- Trade and Industry Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy today called naive some parts of yesterday's 
declaration on East-West trade, when he addressed the 3rd 
conference of G7 and E10 groups. The declaration was adopted 
yesterday by businessmen from the world's seven most advanced 
countries (G7) and ten central and Eastern European 
post-communist countries (Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and 
Ukraine) at an East-West economic forum held within the 
conference. 
  Dlouhy criticised the document also because it opens up the 
door to all foreign investment irrespective of whether or not it 
benefits the receiver partner and accelerates the development of 
the local producer, brings new know-how to the receiver country 
and improves its budget. 
  Just as in an interview for CTK yesterday, Dlouhy dismissed 
"placing all post-communist countries under one umbrella" as 
well as discussing conditions of economic growth in countries 
which have not laid and stabilised the foundations of market 
economy.

  [Text] Prague, May 5 (CTK) -- There will not be any new 
law on national security, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told 
journalists today. He was speaking after today's meeting of 
cabinet ministers rejected a draft bill on national security 
presented by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. The draft was 
drawn up in the radical post-revolutionary spirit and it aimed 
to completely overhaul the existing legislation, Klaus said. 
  The ministers retained the existing law except for a few 
minor changes in the wording, concerning the threat to people's 
security and the extension of the powers of authorities. They 
agreed that no new bodies should be set up in the security 
sector. The bill concerned the deployment of the army for 
life-saving operations necessitated by natural disasters or 
nuclear power plant emergencies. 
  Rules governing the deployment of emergency services 
including the army and fire and security services in the event 
of large-scale disasters, and rules governing the duties of 
individuals in case of national emergencies are at present 
scattered among several laws. The draft bill aimed to bring the 
matter under a single heading.

  [Text] Teplice nad Becvou, North Moravia, May 7 (CTK) -- 
Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today the Executive Council of 
his Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had reaffirmed that the ODS 
stuck to 81 "clear, transparent and comprehensible" 
constituencies for Senate elections. Speaking during a pause in 
the council's deliberations, Klaus said the council "is afraid 
of creating complex electoral systems existing at one place 
somewhere in the world" and was resolutely opposed to it. 
  The ODS Executive Council has recommended to create a 
comprehensible, clear system providing for one-round voting if 
possible, in which the winner of the biggest number of votes 
would be elected senator, Klaus said. He allowed for the 
two-round variant. 
  The other three coalition parties, the Civic Democratic 
Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak 
People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian Democratic Party 
(KDS), had favoured the creation of 27 "three-mandate" 
districts, each of which would send three senators to the new 
house. 
  After a meeting of the four parties' chairmen last week, 
Klaus said the parties were now inclining to the opinion that 
elections to the as yet unformed Senate should take place in 81 
one-mandate constitutions in a direct majority system. 
  Klaus said today the Executive Council would not order party 
leaders to "run for the Senate at any cost if they prefer 
running for the Chamber of Deputies two years later." He called 
the chamber a much more important instrument of the Czech 
Republic's parliamentary system. 
  The Senate elections will probably be held in the autumn, 
when also local elections are slated to be held. Elections to 
the Chamber of Deputies are to be held in 1996.

  [Text] Teplice nad Becvou, North Moravia, May 7 (CTK) -- 
Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today the parliament should say 
that it would pass no more laws redressing the injustices 
committed under the communist regime. Speaking at a press 
conference held within a session of the Executive Council of his 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Klaus said that the state should 
transfer to churches certain property which serves their mission 
and goals, saying that no further "law of a restitution 
character" would be adopted. 
  He said that work continued on a legal document dealing with 
the completion of restitutions and extra-judicial 
rehabilitations also referred to as "a restitution and 
rehabilitation full stop." "We know well that before this 
full-stop is made, questions related to the return of church 
property must be solved," Klaus said. The law winding up 
restitution and rehabilitations should have a preamble saying 
clearly why restitution and rehabilitations were realised and 
what stage they have reached, he added. The law itself would de 
facto rescind all articles of the existing restitution and 
rehabilitation laws (blocking privatisation), Klaus said. 
  Parliament chairman Milan Uhde (ODS) added that the preamble 
must clearly say that "we are aware of the fact that the extent 
of wrongdoings and crimes which had been committed against 
property, human rights and lives is much higher than any law 
could have tackled." "But this does not mean that we, as 
representatives of the state, should engage in a lifetime search 
for definitive and absolute justice," he added. 
  The restitution of church property has for long been a 
question at issue between the ODS and the three other coalition 
parties -- the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian 
Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the 
Christian Democratic Party (KDS) which supported broader 
restitution than the ODS. But Klaus has stressed that the issue 
is hampering and slowing down the process of definite settlement 
of property relations in the country and the process of 
privatisation.

  [Text] Prague, May 9 (CTK) -- The proposal of the Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS) Executive Council that the government 
should return to churches certain property which serves their 
mission and goals, at the same time saying that no further "law 
of a restitution nature" will be adopted, is basically opposed 
by none of the remaining three coalition parties. 
  Jaroslav Orel, spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union- 
Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), told CTK today that he 
considered the proposal to be a fundamental and positive change 
in the ODS's stand on the issue. He said the ODS had approached 
the principle ``to return all the property which was illegally 
confiscated and those to whom it is offered should "wisely 
choose which property they are to claim." [quotation marks as 
received] 
  The KDU-CSL is interested in ending restitution, which would 
be a clear signal from the coalition to the whole country that 
it will always defend the inviolability of private property. 
The KDU-CSL rules out any financial compensation, which would 
burden taxpayers, and believes that the rights of the people who 
obtained their property in good faith should not be put in 
question while ending restitution. 
  Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party (KDS) Ivan Pilip 
told CTK that although the KDS supported the ODS's proposal it 
believes that "the entire problem could by no means be solved in 
such a way." He said that only property which belongs to the 
state could be returned through a government decision and that 
the economic position of the Church in society could hardly be 
settled without a law. 
  The Civic Democratic Alliance believes that extraordinary 
property transfers should be ended as soon as possible, which is 
a pre-condition for the necessary stabilization of ownership 
relations and for an agreement on a definitive stop to 
restitution. Representatives of the coalition parties will deal 
with restitution issues on Tuesday [10 May].

  [Text] Prague, May 9 (CTK) -- The opposition Communist 
Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Left Bloc (LB) party 
are opposed to the further restitution of church property, while 
the Bohemian-Moravian Center Party (CMSS) holds the opposite 
position. The Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) disagrees 
with the restitution of church property by an executive act, 
that is, by the resolution adopted by the government. 
  The KSCM strongly disagrees with the return of any capital 
assets to the Catholic Church, all the more so in an executive 
form, KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK today. 
  The KSCM considers such proposals a mockery of democratic 
principles, and demands that a real and legal full stop is 
immediately made to end restitutions which would at the same 
time put an end to endless property claims from the Church, she 
said. 
  The Communists believe that a further considerable 
concession 
to the Catholic Church will likely be made by the Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the government 
coalition, which would make possible a return of property which 
was put into national management after the war on the basis of 
the decrees directed against collaborators. "It is 
characteristic that the current government is more interested in 
claims from collaborators and their heirs than in compensating 
Nazi victims," Zezulkova said. 
  The LB party rejects further property restitutions because 
they would wind further a "spiral of changes in ownership 
relations," Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the LB deputies' group, 
told CTK. "Besides, nobody has ever specified the scale of 
property to be returned and which present owners the 
restitutions would concern," he said. Ortman said that the 
restitution of church property through a government decision 
would be by-passing the parliament. 
  CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman said that his party was basically 
opposed to the restitution of church property through an 
executive act as it would means the transfer of the 
responsibility from the parliament to the government and would 
thus weaken parliamentary democracy. 
  CMSS Chairman Jan Krycer said that his party, on the 
contrary, considered the restitution of church property to be an 
undisputable moral obligation of the state towards the Church. 
He pointed out that the CMSS had already proposed that the 
Finance Ministry assess property to be returned. The government 
should issue bonds at the overall property value and hand them 
over to the Church with five percent annual interest. It should 
guarantee that the nominal value of the bonds will be paid by 
the state after fifteen years, he said. 
  According to the resolution adopted at a meeting of the ODS 
Executive Council last weekend in Teplice nad Becvou, north 
Moravia, the government should adopt a decision providing for 
the return to churches of certain property which serves their 
mission and goals. 
  ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists 
after the meeting that after this the parliament should say that 
it will pass no more laws redressing the injustices committed 
under the communist regime. The law to wind up restitution and 
rehabilitations would de facto rescind all articles of the 
existing restitution and rehabilitation laws blocking 
privatization, Klaus said.

  [Text] Teplice nad Becvou, north Moravia, May 6 (CTK) -- 
The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would continue its effort to 
cut the number of members in local representative bodies by 
one-third to one-half and to apply the proportional system in 
local elections, spokeswoman Jana Petrova said today. Speaking 
after a session of the ODS Executive Council, she said: "We are 
afraid that our deputies' group will be one of the few to be 
asserting the system because it is not advantageous for small 
parties." Local elections are to take place in November. 
  Petrova said that the working principles of the ODS election 
program had been drafted. The party will turn to the 
independent candidates who are famous personalities in 
particular communities because independents' participation in 
politics was "beneficial," she added. "Presently we are 
selecting an agency for local elections because good candidates 
having a good program must be sold well," Petrova said. 
  The ODS is the strongest parliamentary party with 66 out of 
a 
total of 200 seats. Its chairman is Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.

  [Text] Prague, May 6 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic 
Alliance (ODA) is very upset at the "campaign unleashed with a 
clear purpose" against Chairman of the National Property Fund 
(FNM) Tomas Jezek, Chairman of the ODA's Group of Deputies 
Oldrich Kuzilek said at a press conference today. The campaign 
is undoubtedly politically motivated, and Jezek has ODA's 
support, Kuzilek said. He stressed that the ODA considered 
Jezek a "fair man of honor", and would continue monitoring and 
analyzing the campaign surrounding him, Kuzilek said. 
  "Besides political, anti-transformation intentions, the 
campaign also has aspects linked to the FNM's status as an 
independent institution, such as the filling of the FNM 
Executive Committee. This is fully in the competence of the FNM 
Presidium, and the ODA does not want intervene in this sphere," 
Kuzilek said on behalf of his party. 
  The ODA admits the participation of some of its members in 
certain personal clashes in the "gigantic process (of economic 
transformation)", and explains them as unavoidable "clashes 
between official and executive structures and levels", not as 
any pressures or problems within the ODA, Kuzilek stated.

  [Text] Prague, May 8 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel 
said today the engagement of Czech units in the Persian Gulf and 
in the former Yugoslavia had followed up the performance of the 
Legions in World War One and of the Czechoslovak soldiers in 
fighting World War Two on the Allied side. 
  Havel was speaking at a ceremony at Prague Castle at which 
he 
appointed two new generals on the occasion of the 49th 
anniversary of the end of World War Two. Rostislav Kotil will 
hold the rank during his tenure as commander of the UNPROFOR 
[United Nations Protection Forces] South sector. 
  Havel stressed that it was important that the Czech society 
"be capable of expressing through concrete deeds our 
willingness, will and courage to both defend our own freedom and 
independence and to take part in the joint international defence 
of democratic values anywhere where they are being trampled on." 
  "No one will give us any security guarantees unless he is 
sure that we ourselves are capable of defending our country and 
of taking on the broader responsibility which we are demanding 
on the part of others at the same time," Havel stressed. 
  Present at the ceremony were military attaches from Russia, 
the United States, Britain and France, and World War Two 
veterans.

  [Text] Zlin, South Moravia, May 6 (CTK) -- Environment 
Minister Frantisek Benda expressed his support of nuclear power 
today at a technical college in Zlin. The consumption of 
non-renewable fossil fuels is "barbarianism," he said, but 
emphasized that safety principles had to be respected in nuclear 
power plants. 
  Benda has been opposed to putting into operation the nuclear 
power plant now being under construction in Temelin, south 
Bohemia, until a "nuclear" law is passed by the parliament. The 
law is to clearly define the plant operator's responsibilities 
and address burnt-out fuel dumping. 
  The "Velvet Revolution" did not solve environmental 
problems; 
in fact, the environment is being destroyed now even more than 
in the past, Benda said. "Let us not delude ourselves by 
thinking advanced European countries do not overexploit the 
environment. At home they keep everything neat and orderly, but 
their waste often ends up in developing countries," he cautioned. 
  In Germany, the government subsidizes waste treatment, and 
waste is sold to the Czech Republic for low prices, Benda said, 
adding that this had led many Czech waste treatment plants to 
started buying waste from Germany. 
  The problem will have to be solved by the proposed law on 
waste. The passage of that bill has been delayed in part because 
the Trade and Industry Ministry has not yet prepared a bill on 
packaging, Benda said.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) is the only force which may counterbalance the 
excessive power of the Hungarian Socialist Party. This will be 
at stake in the second round of the parliamentary elections, 
SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a news conference tonight. 
  "The Free Democrats are satisfied with their result, namely 
the acquisition of 20 percent of votes in the first round," Peto 
said. In his view, high voter participation is a success of 
Hungarian democracy. As a result, the government to be formed 
will have a great deal of legitimacy. "The SZDSZ has achieved 
its main goal: the government has been dismissed," Peto said.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Democratic 
Forum (MDF) has received fewer votes than expected, and must 
accept the result of the elections, Hungarian Prime Minister and 
MDF Deputy Chairman Peter Boross told a news conference tonight. 
He said he hoped no one would doubt that the Hungarian 
elections were free and democratic. 
  "The Hungarian Socialist Party has made a push forward. The 
vote expressed the will of the people and should be accepted 
with a bow," Boross said. "In the spirit of its ideals, the MDF 
will continue to take part in the country's political life," the 
prime minister said. Boross expressed the hope that his party 
would fare much better in the second round of the elections.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Monday edition of every 
Hungarian national daily gave extensive coverage to the first 
round of parliamentary elections on Sunday, May 8. Much of the 
coverage extended to praising the high voter-turnout and the 
calm atmosphere that marked the voting, and to quotations of 
preliminary election count results, which placed the Hungarian 
Socialist Party in first place and the Alliance of Free 
Democrats in second place. 
  In its commentary headlined "Calmly", NEPSZABADSAG says, 
"The 
task today is to look to the future calmly, irrespective of 
whether one considers what happened to be a sweeping victory, or 
a defeat. ...The main lesson for those in power, who will most 
probably be forced to leave after the run-off elections in three 
weeks, will be that no political force can dismiss dialogue with 
society. Those at the helm up to now liked to believe they know 
exactly what the people, and the nation, needs and desires, 
while humiliating those ruled by them every day." 
  "What people in Hungary want most is dignity; they wish for 
their ability and performance to be recognized and for their 
leaders to give a free rein to their creative power. This is 
where they were disappointed most over the past four years, and 
this is probably why they voted the way they did." 
  NEPSZABADSAG formulates the following lessons for political 
forces emerging on top after the elections: "They must reach 
understanding with the people and with the opposition, while 
proving themselves prepared and competent to hold the reins of 
power. They must be aware that their coming to power should 
mean respect for popular sovereignty." 
  UJ MAGYARORSZAG says, "Four years ago the majority agreed on 
what they did not want. Now, it seems that while one half of 
society does not know what they want, the left wing is fairly 
capitalizing on electors' forgetfulness, nostalgia, desire for 
revenge, and discontent. Such is democracy, they say. ...It 
already seems certain that the Socialists have increased chances 
of forming a government. This -- in view of their promises and 
past -- holds not much good for the future. Behind the 
flickering computer screens, a vision is emerging of people 
queuing in long lines outside banks to take out the currency 
they saved at the time of the outvoted coalition. This will 
also be a vote, costing far more than yesterday's."

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- "Major national cooperation 
is needed in order to try to turn round the current situation. 
The Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) wishes to lead this 
national cooperation," MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi said on 
Monday at his party's press conference, analysing first round 
election results. 
  Herenyi said the MDF could contact Christian Democrats and 
Independent Smallholders at local level, wherever candidates of 
these two parties are still in the running for the second round. 
The spokesman said the Hungarian Justice and Life Party has no 
political weight at all after its tiny election result, but the 
MDF counts on the voting base of Istvan Csurka's party. 
  Herenyi also said the Democratic Forum presidium met on 
Monday morning. There was no debate at the session, he said, 
and the evaluation was limited to merely stating the results. 
He added that dispute and looking for possible scapegoats would 
be dangerous between the two rounds of the elections. It seems 
to the MDF senior body that the renewed advance of former 
leftists cannot be stopped in Central and Eastern Europe.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- Hungarian people wanted 
something different than what the Federation of Young Democrats 
(Fidesz) stands for," was how Fidesz chief Viktor Orban saw the 
worse-than-expected results of his party in the first round of 
national elections. 
  To reporters on Monday, Orban said the Central European 
trend, whereby the first freely elected government is unable to 
grapple with the economic inheritance of the past, is 
continuing. He said the Polish scenario happened in Hungary, 
and the strategy of the Young Democrats to prevent this was 
unsuccessful. He was confident that the voting public wanted 
radical change, and change in the political elite, which is why 
the parties that did not promise this fared more poorly than 
expected. 
  According to Orban, liberal cooperation can be upheld in the 
second round of the elections, but will not have a marked 
impact, partly due to the poorer results of the Young Democrats. 
Orban said he would not resign, but the Fidesz's congress this 
summer will be able to implement personnel changes, although his 
mandate originally runs for two years, until 1995.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Independent 
Smallholders' Party (FKGP) has emerged from the elections 
stronger and legitimised, party chairman Jozsef Torgyan told a 
press conference on Monday. 
  While the FKGP is gravely concerned by the socialist-liberal 
victory in the elections, they see the results as the sovereign 
choice of the Hungarian people, and are preparing for a 
contructive opposition role. Torgyan believes the Smallholders 
will lead the national Christian grouping in the new Parliament. 
On their results so far, 8.8 per cent of the votes, the FKGP 
think they might win 40-45 mandates out of the 386.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- One million plus votes 
cast for the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) prove the party 
has a stable voter base, and that Hungarian politics is 
three-cornered now: The right is split but still led by the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the left is the Socialists, 
leaving the Free Democrats in the middle, Gabor Kuncze, SZDSZ 
prime minister candidate, told reporters today. What will be at 
stake in the second round will be the Socialists' ability to win 
an absolute majority in Parliament, something which the Free 
Democrats see as undesirable, Kuncze said. He was happy to see 
extremists squeezed out of Parliament. 
  SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto said that an agreement between the 
four liberal parties (SZDSZ, Federation of Young Democrats, 
Entrepreneurs' Party, Agrarian Association) means candidates 
will withdraw from the second round in one another's favour in 
13 constituencies. In reply to a question, Peto ruled out talks 
on mutual withdrawals with the MDF.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The National Election 
Committee (NEC), as obliged by law, on Monday afternoon 
announced official preliminary results for the first round of 
parliamentary elections in Hungary. 
  Accordingly, 5,480,056 of the 7,952,445 eligible voters cast 
their ballots on Sunday, which is a voter turnout of 68.91 
percent. Two individual candidates won seats in Parliament in

  [Text] Budapest, May 8 (MTI) -- The condition of Gyula Horn 
is satisfactory, or even good in the circumstances, Dr. Jozsef 
Dobai, senior physician in Miskolc Hospital, told the 
correspondent of MAI NAP late on Saturday [7 May]. The chairman 
of the Hungarian Socialist Party damaged a neck vertebra and 
broke his wrist in a car crash late on Thursday. 
  "Although Horn can already walk with help, he cannot yet 
leave the hospital as he would like to. The more rest he gets, 
the more likely his medical treatment will be successful. What 
is certain: He needs no surgery in his present condition. In my 
opinion, he cannot be released from hospital before Wednesday," 
Dobai said. According to VASARNAPI HIREK (SUNDAY NEWS), doctors 
will decide on Wednesday whether the politician can leave the 
hospital on Thursday or Friday.

  [Text] Budapest, May 8 (MTI) -- The Miskolc County Hospital 
received hundreds of telephone calls on Sunday [8 May], 
inquiring after the condition of the chairman of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (HSP), Gyula Horn, who was injured in a car 
accident. There were rumours that Horn's health had 
deteriorated and he was in critical condition. To prevent other 
rumours, the physician-director of the hospital, Zoltan Katona, 
told MTI's correspondent in Miskolc that the HSP chairman 
continues to be in good condition compared to the injuries 
suffered. 
  In order to speed up his recovery, a minor operation was 
carried out on Horn's right wrist on Sunday morning. This means 
that the traditional cast used for broken bones was replaced 
with a plate fixing procedure, so that the HSP chairman will be 
able to use his hand much earlier. 
  Dr. Katona also said the party chairman will be allowed to 
leave his bed on Monday, and is expected to leave the Miskolc 
hospital in the second half of the week. Many patients in the 
largest hospital of Miskolc County exercised their voting rights 
through the mobile ballot boxes. According to MTI's 
information, Gyula Horn declined to use this opportunity, as 
that would mean he would have to vote in Miskolc in the second 
round of the elections, but he does not wish to be a resident of 
the hospital at that time.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- Strengthening 
Hungarian-Albanian ties is a mutual interest, Hungarian 
President Arpad Goncz told Albanian President Sali Berisha, who 
travelled through Hungary to Romania, today. Hungary and 
Albania have no conflicting interests, and the two peoples share 
a centuries-old friendship, Goncz said. The brief talk focussed 
on the Balkan crisis and the state of the Albanian minority in 
Serbia and Montenegro, Andras Farago, President Goncz's 
spokesman said. 
  Goncz stressed the need for a comprehensive solution in the 
region, which would settle the situation of all ethnic 
minorities. 
  The sides exchanged views on the Albanian-Hungarian basic 
treaty, investment protection agreement, and internal security 
treaty to be concluded. Both sides appreciated the agreement on 
the elimination of double taxation which was signed previously. 
  Finally, President Berisha said Hungary's peaceful 
transition 
and transformation set Albania an example. He hoped that the 
Hungarian president would soon visit Albania.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 6 -- President Lech Walesa received on 
Friday British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is on a 
working visit to Poland. President said that he is satisfied 
with Polish-British relations and stressed that Poland attaches 
great importance to bilateral relations. He also expressed the 
hope that the Polish point of view on the development of 
situation in eastern Europe would be better understood by Great 
Britain. 
  Douglas Hurd expressed his satisfaction at the meeting 
emphasising that Poland made huge progress on the path of 
transformations under Walesa's leadership. Changes taking place 
in Europe, however, require cooperation, especially in 
political, economical and military areas. Our common aim, said 
the British politician, should be unification of Europe, whose 
Poland is a very important member.

  [Text] Luxembourg, Brussels, Warsaw, May 9 -- The Western 
European Union (WEU) granted on Monday "associate partner" 
status to Poland. The documents were signed in Luxembourg 
during the meeting of foreign and defence ministers of the WEU 
member states attended by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski and Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. 
  "Although it does not meet all Poland's expectations, the 
status of the WEU associate partner gives a possibility for a 
concrete cooperation, brings Poland nearer to political and 
defence structures of Western Europe," Mieczyslaw Kuzinski of 
the Polish Foreign Ministry said on Monday. He also added that 
the status increases Poland's security by several percent. 
  The "associate partner" status was also granted to Hungary, 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Estonia 
and Lithuania. These countries have concluded, or are 
negotiating, association accords with the European Union [EU]. 
Formally, the agreement will be implemented after ratification 
of Greece membership in the WEU. 
  As the WEU "associate partner" Poland can attend every 
second 
meeting of the WEU ambassadors' session at the organisation's 
head office in Brussels and suggest subjects for discussion. It 
will also get access to information and will be able to 
participate in joint manoeuvres and trainings. The "associate 
partners" will be also able to take part in humanitarian and 
peacekeeping missions organised by the WEU. 
  The status does not provide for any security guarantees. 
Nevertheless, it expresses WEU and EU interest in security 
problems in central and eastern Europe, Kuzinski said. 
According to the Polish Foreign Ministry, the distance between 
Poland and Western security structures is diminishing. 
  The WEU was created in 1954 and is to be a defence 
organisation of EU member states. After the fall of the Berlin 
wall, it has been turned into NATO's "European pillar". It 
groups all EU states except Denmark and Ireland which are 
"observers". 
  Poland was seeking the "associate member" status which has 
been granted to NATO members -- Iceland, Norway and Turkey. The 
term "associate partner" came up in negotiations only a month 
ago. 
  The French and German foreign ministers expressed their 
satisfaction with granting nine central Europe countries the 
status of "associate partner" and stressed that it is a joint 
success of French and German diplomacy. Klaus Kinkel also 
mentioned the Polish diplomacy. 
  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski recalled that his 
predecessor Krzysztof Skubiszewski had been also striving for 
the association with the WEU. In November last year, foreign 
ministers of France, Germany and Poland issued a joint 
declaration on the matter at a meeting in Warsaw. Asked what 
has not been achieved, Olechowski said that the right of the 
associate partners to convene the WEU council when they consider 
it necessary.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 5--Chairman of the National Radio and 
Television Council Ryszard Bender has sent a letter to Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak in which he asked the prime minister if 
his criticism of the information policy of the Telewizja Polska 
S.A. public television included in his recent address in the 
Sejm was of an official nature. Bender, holding a press 
conference on Thursday, said that in case of an affirmative 
answer the council will react to the complaint. 
  Council member Marek Siwiec added that the councils failure 
to take a stand "on the existing conflict is something like 
hiding one's head in the sand." 
  Ryszard Bender, recently appointed the head of the council 
by 
President Lech Walesa to replace Marek Markiewicz, took the 
advantage to state that he has also received letters in which TV 
viewers protested against moving the "Prosto Z Belwederu" 
(Directly From the Belvedere) programme, a weekly review of 
activities of the Polish president, to late evening hours. 
  Lech Dymarski, also of the council, said that the council 
has 
still not adopted a regulation concerning the air time limits 
for political parties and union organizations to be granted by 
public TV and radio before the June local elections. 
  The Council, according to Dymarski, is waiting for opinions 
of programmatic councils of the Polish Television and the Polish 
Radio.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 6 -- A presidential constitutional draft 
law was filed with the constitutional committee of the National 
Assembly Friday. The draft comprises a systemic part and the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [sentence as received] 
  Under the proposed law, legislative powers are vested in the 
444- strong Sejm and the 100-strong Senate. The Sejm's term of 
office is four years. The executive branch is headed by the 
president elected in general elections for a five-year term. A 
candidate for the president must have Polish citizenship and 
cannot be below 35 years of age. Candidates for presidency can 
be proposed by a group of 500,000 citizens, by 136 members of 
the National Assembly or by the outgoing president. The draft 
also says that the president can be reelected only once. 
  The president has the right to appoint and recall the 
cabinet, to issue decrees with the force of law and decrees in 
case of state emergency. The armed forces are part of the 
executive power and are subordinated to the president. The 
president supervises the activity of state organs in matters 
connected with Poland's external and internal security. He 
decides about the introduction of the state of emergency. 
  No countersignature is needed for the president's decision 
to 
dissolve parliament before the end of its term of office, for 
his initiative concerning changes in the Constitution, the 
appointment and the dismissal of the prime minister and cabinet 
members. 
  Under the proposed law, the government implements state 
policy and controls the administration. The law also envisages 
the establishment of the office of the chief prosecutor, 
appointed by the president, that will be attached to the Council 
of Ministers. A motion for the vote of no-confidence in the 
cabinet or a member of the cabinet must be signed by 111 
deputies and has to be submitted seven days before the vote and 
be passed by an absolute majority of votes. 
  Three main principles of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
are dignity, freedom, and equality before the law. It 
guarantees the freedom of conscience and religion, the freedom 
of thought and convictions. It prohibits censorship and ensures 
freedom to art, science and scientific research. 
  In the part relating to social and economic rights and 
freedoms the charter ensures free education at public elementary 
schools and basic medical care in public health service 
institutions. 
  "No authorities can limit the rights and freedoms guaranteed 
under the charter," it is stressed in the document attached to 
the presidential constituional draft law. 
  The president appointed his representatives who would 
particiapte in the work of the constitutional committee of the 
National Assembly. They are deputy head of the presidential 
chancellery Lech Falandysz, professors Andrzej Ajnenkiel, Michal 
Pietrzak, Andrzej Rzeplinski, and Wladyslaw Kulesza.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- Carl-Dieter Spranger, 
German minister of economic cooperation, who has been in Romania 
for a few days now and had multiple contacts, was received by 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu on 6 May evening. 
  At the close of the interview President Iliescu termed the 
Romanian-German relations as increasingly good, saying Germany 
was the country that understood the best Romania's difficulties 
caused by the processes of transformation that resembled those 
of the former GDR. "We have found with Germany a more exact 
perception of our problems in the process of transition," the 
Romanian head of state said. 
  As far as the economic relations between the two countries 
were concerned, the president pointed to the existence of mutual 
interests, explaining that both Romania and Germany were located 
"on the Rhine-Main-Danube trans-European axis, with two 
terminals, Rotterdam and Constanta, and with the German economy 
at the center, which will be the engine of the general process 
of the European integration." 
  The German guest noted the good level of the bilateral 
relations. "I believe the reforms these last few years in 
Romania, and especially the situation after 1993 can stir the 
interest of foreign investors," he said. 
  The German minister of economic cooperation, Carl-Dieter 
Spranger met on Friday, 6 May, in Bucharest with the Romanian 
minister of state, head of the Council for Economic 
Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, Mircea Cosea. 
  Within his presentation of the Romanian economy, Mircea 
Cosea 
said that Romania was giving a very special attention to its 
relations with Germany, because there existed a tradition of 
German industry presence in Romania in the sectors of railroads, 
iron and steel industry, and telecommunications. The Romanian 
minister expressed hope that Romania would benefit from German 
aid of capital and technology in the process of reform. Cosea 
said that the German business mentality could be a very 
important factor in the process of reform. 
  The German minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said his visit was 
a 
signal for the extending of the relations with Romania. The 
signing of the agreement on the non-reimbursable economic 
assistance granted to Romania is a relevant sign, said the 
German minister. 
  Minister Spranger said that Germany would send in Romania 
experts in privatization, banking system updating, stock 
exchanges, industrial restructuring, and social protection. 
  Romania is interested in developing a proper collaboration 
framework with Germany, that should allow for the presence of 
German businessmen here, the setting up of joint ventures, as 
well as the intensification of the actions of cooperation and 
commercial exchanges, said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu on 6 May, during his interview with Carl-Dieter 
Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation of Germany. 
The Romanian premier assessed that the signing of the technical 
assistance agreement between the two countries was part of the 
preoccupations to improve the management of the commercial 
companies and update and retool the industrial units, especially 
those built with German technology. 
  Minister Spranger said Germany would further back Romania's 
efforts in the European Union, the OECD [Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development], and the World Bank. 
Referring to the German minority in Romania, Spranger said the 
Romanian state's policy with respect to that community was 
favorably regarded in his country.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- "The Partnership for 
Peace has a special significance for Romania," Gheorghe Tinca, 
Romanian minister of defense states in an interview with the 
periodical PARLAMENTUL. 
  "We were the first to sign the document-framework," he 
recalls, adding that "Romania's adherence to that programme is 
not only a major step, a stage towards the proper guaranteeing 
of national security, but it comes to answer also our 
determination to fully integrate within European and 
Euro-Atlantic structures, an objective fully embraced by all 
political parties represented in Romania's Parliament. The 
adherence to the Partnership for Peace programme of all 
Romania's neighboring states and their commitment to observe the 
principles of that programme would be able to provide certain 
indirect guarantees for the consolidation of our national 
security. That is why we have insisted on the fact that the 
Partnership for Peace should be open to all states, for we want 
them to take active part in the process initiated by NATO," the 
Romanian minister added. 
  Mentioning that "Romania had already set its aims in the 
process of army restructuring, before the initiation of the 
Partnership for Peace programme, whose aims are similar to the 
programme's objectives," Gheorghe Tinca went on to say that "the 
Romanian military doctrine is traditionally a defensive one, 
which matches the partnership's norms, while as regards the 
army's restructuring, training and techniques, all these are to 
face a process of modernization". 
  "We would say that Romania is viewing the peace partnership 
as an instrument to encourage investments, business, and 
economic development. In fact it is not by mere coincidence 
that simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace much talk is 
done about a Partnership for Prosperity. From the very first 
statements regarding the Partnership for Peace, Romania's 
President Ion Iliescu referred to the need for an economic 
partnership, a concept that should be extended not only to the 
European continent but to the entire world," the Romanian 
minister of defense concluded.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- In connection with 
various press commentaries regarding the banned entry to the 
country of Romania's former sovereign, presidential spokesman 
Traian Chebeleu made a few points during the news conference of 
Friday, 6 May. He stressed that "Romania's Government did not 
pose other terms than those communicated by the former king 
himself: The private character of the visit and abstention from 
questioning the present constitutional order." In subsequent 
talks, Chebeleu added, the executive wanted to make sure the 
terms would be observed, advancing a number of proposals meant 
to make the visit possible, but they were turned down by the 
former sovereign, who conditioned the visit on his travel to 
Bucharest or Timisoara. That, the spokesman said, would have 
gone beyond the private character of the visit and it would have 
been difficult to avoid anti-constitutional manifestations and 
public disorder. In order to substantiate that assertion, 
Traian Chebeleu quoted ex-king Mihai's message to the country 
with obvious "inadmissible appeals inciting the population 
against the constitutional order." 
  Referring to the stands of some non-government bodies in the 
country on this matter, who complained with the Council of 
Europe, Traian Chebeleu said they "have no serious ground."

  [Text] Bratislava, May 6 (CTK) -- The Slovak Confederation 
of Trade Unions (KOS) has withdrawn from the General Agreement 
in connection with its unsuccessful meeting yesterday with the 
government and employers, the other two members of the 
"tripartite" formed to discuss economic and social policy. The 
General Agreement is concluded by the tripartite every year with 
the aim of preserving social peace. 
  KOS's departure from the general agreement could result in 
an 
outbreak of social unrest. The unionists will determine their 
further steps at an extraordinary meeting of KOS's board. The 
confederation's criticism is based on the allegation that the 
government so far has not presented a clear proposal for the 
creation of a social security fund, and was not prepared for 
yesterday's meeting. 
  The government is proposing the fund be formed from 0.1 
percent of company costs and from 0.9 percent of profit, and 
that it begin functioning on January 1, 1995. The unions, 
however, are pushing for a social security fund drawn from 1.0 
percent of company costs, and want it to begin from the first of 
July this year. 
  Despite the fact that the government already conceded the 
fund's creation from a percent of costs at the last tripartite 
meeting, it is still attempting to limit the ways that the money 
could be used. The unions insist, however, that the distribution 
of the benefits be determined in collective bargaining. 
  Talks between unions and the government were interrupted 
partly because the government began to suggest a lack of legal 
justification for the fund's establishment, citing 
contradictions in the constitution. Some contend that the 
government is intentionally prolonging the negotiations so that 
the initiation of the fund will be put off until the beginning 
of next year. 
  A further point of contention was the proposed law on 
government allowances for children. The plan of the unions, 
calling for payments to be made to families whose incomes do not 
exceed the subsistence minimum by two and a half times, would 
add 300 billion korunas (about $9 billion) to the budget 
expenditures. 
  The government agreed with the unions that KOS's viewpoint 
would be presented along with the bill when it goes to 
parliament.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 6 (CTK) -- The screening 
(lustration) of members of the Slovak Government is being held 
up by certain technical shortcomings, Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik said on Slovak radio today. At present no official 
body existed in Slovakia with the competence to issue screening 
certificates, he added. The cabinet is being screened to 
ascertain whether any of its members collaborated with the 
communist secret police, since Slovak law bans former 
collaborators from holding high public office. 
  The Slovak Information Service (SIS) was charged by the 
former government with issuing screening certificates for a 
period of nine months, by which time the problem was to have 
been solved, Moravcik said. However, ex-Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar's cabinet did not solve the problem by this date. The 
shortcoming would be dealt with at the next parliamentary 
session, Moravcik said. 
  He also pointed to the fact that the previous government had 
not proceeded at all in accordance with the valid screening law. 
"We have been, and will be, thorough in this respect," he said. 
  With reference to Economy Minister Peter Magvasi, who is 
rumored to be having problems in obtaining a negative 
certificate, Moravcik said that Magvasi was "a very capable 
minister" who in a short time had managed to gain a good 
reputation abroad. "However, we have to wait for the results of 
the screening," he said.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 8 (CTK) -- Ex-premier Vladimir 
Meciar today accused the government coalition of having brought 
parliamentary democracy into a profound crisis and said the 
parliament was liquidating constitutional officials and was 
monitoring the activity of neither the president nor the "ruling 
politburo." 
  In a live television debate, Meciar accused Deputy Premier 
Roman Kovac, a former member of his Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS), of having embezzled five million dollars. 
Kovac, also taking part in the debate, said he would lodge a 
complaint against Meciar. 
  Earlier this week, the parliament failed to pass a vote of 
no 
confidence in Kovac motioned by the opposition. But the 
opposition was unable to submit any evidence to support its 
embezzlement claim. 
  Meciar pointed out an alleged disagreement between the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the rest of the government 
coalition. He told SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, also present at 
the debate, that he had made him four "serious offers" to create 
a coalition when the HZDS was at power (until March 11). 
  Meciar also claimed that there were serious disagreements 
within the SDL and that Weiss had sent to the government people 
with whom he had been in conflict so that they "discredit 
themselves by the elections." He specially mentioned Defence 
Minister Pavol Kanis and Agriculture Minister Pavel Koncos. 
  Elections are to be held on September 30-October 1. 
  Meciar also attacked Premier Jozef Moravcik in connection 
with the screening (lustration) of government members. He said 
that it is amoral of Moravcik, "a former member of a Communist 
Party of Czechoslovakia Leninist group," to demand that the 
ministers submit a negative screening certificate. Under the 
screening law of 1991, former high-ranking communist officials, 
collaborators with the secret police (StB) and members of the 
People's Militia (the party's paramilitary force) are barred 
from public posts until 1996. 
  Meciar also criticised the Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH), saying that it was usurping the right to assert in the 
coalition solely its own interests. 
  In this situation the cabinet exists only thanks to "a 
secret 
agreement" with representatives of the Hungarian coalition of 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Egyutteles which 
supports it at the cost of "outrageous conditions." The 
Hungarian coalition represents an ethnic minority of about 
560,000 or 11 per cent of the Slovak population. It has 14 out 
of a total of 150 seats in the parliament. 
  Meciar claimed that the HZDS had never "dictated" anything 
in 
the parliament which, he added, could not be said of the present 
coalition. "We have never had an absolute majority, we always 
decently asked for support," he said. 
  Meciar dismissed the arguments of the coalition 
representatives present at the debate, who said that it was 
mainly his own fault that he had lost one-quarter of his 
deputies over one and a quarter years and that he had painted a 
bad picture of Slovakia abroad. "You are only conceited, you 
are not strong," Meciar told the present coalition.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 9 (CTK) -- The division of 
Czechoslovakia is irreversible and the most important question 
of the present is to ensure the best possible representation of 
right-wing forces in the Slovak parliamentary elections, former 
Czechoslovak Interior Minister Jan Langos told CTK today. He 
pointed to the important fact that the division of the 
federation was not supported by the majority of the Slovak 
population and that from the point of view of economic 
transformation and the development of democracy the separation 
was definitely unprofitable for Slovakia. 
  "Nevertheless, the division on which the winners of the 1992 
parliamentary elections agreed, separated the two nations 
irreversibly. Realists cannot cherish any illusions about a 
return," said Langos, who is a representative of the Permanent 
Conference of the Civic Institute (SKOI). 
  "The questions are quite different nowadays. An independent 
Slovakia is a reality. What is essential today is to ensure 
that the right wing is represented in the elections in the best 
possible way. That is why we welcome the proposal from the 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) and are ready to fulfill 
certain conditions which they might set," Langos said. 
  He was reacting to a statement by Anton Hrnko, deputy 
chairman of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative 
(NDS-NA), who said that accepting the offer to fill vacant 
positions on the KDH election slate with representatives of the 
right-wing parties would threaten Slovak politics with the 
return of "creatures from Jurassic Park," that is of people who 
are consistently returning to the idea of a common state in 
their thoughts. 
  "These emotional statements are characteristic of weaker 
political entities and their representatives," Langos said. 
Their authors should rather think about what parties they 
represented in the past and what their place in history would 
be," he said. Hrnko was formerly a member of the Slovak 
Communist Party (KSS) and of the Slovak National Party (SNS). 
  "Our defense of Czechoslovakia has never stemmed from the 
idea of Czechoslovakism but from the view that the federal 
state, in the period of the transition from communism to 
democracy, was much more advantageous for Slovakia," Langos 
said. "We should offer a clear, concrete, and distinct 
alternative, now only for Slovakia, based on an acceptable 
program. The quality of the program is proved or disproved by 
concrete results," Langos said. 
  Many parties lack realistic programs, he said. "This is not 
only the problem of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar. The policy of all parties 
today is seen only from the point of view of their "effective 
anti-Meciar orientation" which conceals the political inability 
of these parties. "Many anti-Meciar coalitions also have their 
weak points," he said. 
  After the Civic Democratic Union (ODU) ceased to exist last 
autumn, some of its members established an informal group which 
named itself the Civic Institute. They gather regularly to 
formulate their views and positions and inform journalists of 
them. 
  After the early parliamentary elections in Slovakia were 
announced (to be held on September 30-October 1), individual 
members from the SKOI were given offer of running on the slate 
of the KDH and to thus contribute to the unification of the 
right wing in Slovakia.

Mediation of a Third Party -- Key Question in the Hogg-Rugova 
Talks -- Press Conference of the British Minister of State Hogg 
and President of Kosova Rugova"] 
  [Text] Tirana, May 6 (ATA) -- "There are problems in 
bringing about a reconciliation between the points of view of 
the Serbs and those of the Albanian community", the British 
minister of state Douglas Hogg said yesterday in Pristina. He 
said that ``the Serbs have shown readiness to allow local 
governing and autonomy, but within the expanded borders of 
Serbia. 
  "I also know that the Albanian community considers this 
solution as unjust", Mr. Hogg said. 
  "The international community holds that a constant control 
is 
indispensable to make sure that the Albanians attain broader 
political rights in Kosova", he said. 
  Hogg said that the aim of his visit to Kosova was to 
negotiate further developments, express his views on Rugova's 
moderated policy "which is absolutely right and in the long-term 
interest of the Albanian population". 
  Mr. Rugova assessed this high-ranking visit as "a special 
honour" and confirmed that they discussed the possibility of 
opening the dialogue through the mediation of a third party. 
  "As any party, we, too, have our own views on the talks. We 
must negotiate without prejudices", said Rugova, who reiterated 
the stance of the Kosovar Albanians on an independent and 
neutral Kosova.

  [Text] Tirana, May 5 (ATA) -- Serbian military forces and 
vehicles are being concentrated in the Dubovc village of 
Vushtrise in Kosova. They are expected to engage in a series of 
military exercises which, according to Serbian military 
officials, will continue until May 16 and also extend to the 
villages of Galice and Mikushnice, according to reports from 
Prishtina. 
  The Serbian military command has ordered the stopping of the 
movement of the population between May 9-11 in the said villages 
because of the use of firing arms by the forces during their 
training. 
  Also, on May 4, two columns of the Serbian Army, with many 
armoured vehicles headed for the villages of Duboc, Galice, and 
Mikushnice of Drenice. The Serbian officers ordered the staff 
and pupils of the elementary school Azem Bejtja not to move on 
next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday [9, 10, 11 May] from 0400 
o'clock in the morning until 1600, because of the military 
exercises. Other inhabitants of these Albanian villages were 
warned of this, as well. 
  Sources from these villages report that the people's 
movement, especially at night, is very dangerous because of the 
military presence.

  [Text] Tirana, May 7 (ATA) -- According to reports, a group 
of 27 Albanians, mainly youngsters expelled from Sweden after 
their requests for political asylum were refused, were not 
allowed to return to Kosova. Police authorities at the Serbian 
border said to the Swedish representatives who were accompanying 
the Albanians that "the group cannot return to Kosova and you 
can do anything you like with them." 
  This act ranks Serbia in the group of countries like Eritrea 
and Ethiopia which do not accept their nationals return to the 
country, the largest Swedish newspaper DAGENS NYHETER writes. 
It also reports that a day after, the group of Albanians were 
sent back to Stockholm and then to some cities in Sweden to stay 
for some days until a reply will be given. 
  According to international convention of 1948, everyone has 
the right to return to his country. But human rights are not of 
any value in countries like Serbia, said Bjorn Gesta Sporong, 
adviser in the Justice Department at the Swedish Foreign 
Ministry.

  [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- The hunger strike staged by 
representatives of the villages over flooded by the lake of the 
Fierza Hydro-Power Station entered in its sixth day. The health 
state of the strikers is getting worse. According to Doctor 
Azem Brasha, many of the strikers are suffering from bronchitis 
and two of them have been hospitalized. The unsuitable hall in 
which the strikers are placed has its own effect on the 
worsening of their health. 
  Meanwhile, in front of the building of the district council, 
where the strike is being staged, crowds of people gather time 
and again in support of the strikers. The chairman of the 
commission of the strike, Jahir Trota, told ATA that the 
strikers are determined to welcome Premier Meksi in Kukes and 
are delighted that the president and the government consider 
their demands as right. 
  In the meantime, the political forces and local government 
keep constant contacts with the strikers in order to find a way 
out to stop the strike and start dialogue regarding their 
demands. The strikers refuse to evacuate the building of the 
district council, an unlawful act, and continue the strike in 
another place because they are afraid the state bodies will 
continue to be indifferent towards them.

  [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- A government commission, 
convened on May 9 to take measures for the elimination of the 
economic consequences created by the lake of the Fierza 
Hydropower Station in the districts of Kukes, Has, Tropoje, and 
Puke, was assembled today, premier's Press and Information 
Office reports. Chairman of the government commission is Bashkim 
Kopliku, deputy premier and in charge of the economic reform, 
its members are Ministers Hasan Halili, Rexhep Uka, Ilir 
Manushi, Piro Dishnica, Abdyl Xhaja, and Dashamir Shehi. 
Attending the meeting which was presided over by Premier 
Aleksander Meksi were also deputies Tonin Alimehilli, Skender 
Jaku, and Gaqo Rota. 
  At the end of the meeting the commission decided to 
accelerate the implementation of urgent measures for the 
improvement of the economic situation in the above districts. A 
priority will be the gradual transfer of family groups that are 
in a seriously worse situation to various zones of Albania. 
  The commission considered right the demands for a 
compensation for the inundated agricultural land and 
construction sites, the granting of long-term credits for the 
construction of homes and the organized transfer of the 
families. The commission considered as groundless and not based 
on laws the granting of an annual rent for the inundated land 
and a supplementary payment to the inundated houses. After the 
meeting, the team of deputies left for Kukes.

  [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- Yesterday morning an 
explosion occurred in the house of Nebil Cika, editor-in-chief 
of the weekly local newspaper SARANDA, as a result of which only 
some material damages were caused, ATA correspondent in Sarande 
reported. 
  This is the second explosion after the first one on March 3 
which also resulted only in material damage. The SARANDA 
newspaper, directed by Mr. Cika and published in Sarande, 
opposes the policy of Greek chauvinistic circles in regard to 
the southern part of Albania, which they call North Epirus. An 
article published recently in the SARANDA dwelt on question of 
the Albanian population forcibly transferred from Cameria, an 
Albanian province given to Greece by the 1913 Conference of 
Ambassadors. The Greek andarts [as received] have committed 
massacres in Cameria after the First and Second World Wars, 
which are still alive in the memories of the inhabitants of this 
region.

  [Text] Sofia, May 8 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov 
announced his proposals for cabinet changes in a telephone 
interview for the national radio this morning. Tomorrow he will 
hold consultations with the political forces and on Wednesday 
[11 May] he will submit at parliament the cabinet's programme by 
year's end and the proposals for structural and personnel 
changes in the incumbent cabinet. 
  Prof. Berov said the changes will not affect the Ministries 
of Defence, of the Interior and Agriculture. He will propose 
that some of the branch committees be closed down, including the 
Forestry Committee, whose functions will be taken over by the 
Environment Ministry. The Power Engineering Committee (PEC) 
will be transformed into a ministry to be headed by now PEC 
Chairman Nikita Shervadshidze. The proposals for cabinet 
changes also include a new trade minister. According to the 
prime minister, a new deputy prime minister without a portfolio 
should be named to replace Valentin Karabashev, who recently 
resigned. A candidate for this office is economist Roumen 
Getchev. All agencies, and particularly the Privatization 
Agency, will continue to operate contrary to press reports. 
Commenting on press allegations that Justice Minister Peter 
Kornazhev will be replaced, Prime Minister Berov said that he 
only declared his intention to move at parliament for revoking 
the memorandum on the execution of death sentences, to which the 
justice minister responded by threatening to resign in case the 
MPs second the proposal. 
  According to Prof. Berov, the figures on the May 4 token 
strike called by the Confederation of the Independent Trade 
Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB, one of the two major labour 
organizations in this country) were substantially exaggerated. 
He further said that the future will show how many people 
supported the strike and what ends it was after: social or 
political, adding that all of KNSB's reasonable demands will be 
met.

  [Text] Sofia, May 10 (BTA) -- The main parliamentary 
forces today met to decide their positions on the planned 
cabinet changes. Government spokesman Raycho Raykov does not 
believe that the changes will be discussed this week. The prime 
minister has yet to confer with the main parliamentary forces 
supporting his government. There will be no drastic changes in 
the cabinet's policy, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev, speaking at a 
working lunch today with the ambassadors of the 12 European 
Union [EU] member countries and the three applicants for EU 
membership: Austria, Finland and Sweden. 
  The ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) reiterated 
the stance on the government it took in early April. "The BSP 
wants, as much as possible, to see the creation of conditions 
for the country's stabilization, for overcoming the unfavourable 
tendencies in the economy, the social sphere and international 
monetary and financial relations," BSP deputy floor leader 
Krasimir Premyanov told a news conference. "There are still no 
reasons to revise our policy line," said Vladimir Topencharov, 
member of the party leadership. 
  According to Mr. Premyanov, the BSP has not yet received 
adequate guarantees that keeping Valentin Aleksandrov as 
minister of defence in the cabinet would ease tensions in the 
Bulgarian Army. Speaking to reporters today, Mr. Osman Oktay MP 
of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) 
described as a "satisfactory option" the prime minister's 
supervisory function with respect to the "power" ministries. In 
a telephone interview on Bulgarian national radio on Sunday [8 
May], Prime Minister Berov indicated that there will be no 
changes in the Ministry of Defence. 
  According to officially unconfirmed reports, incumbent 
Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov may be nominated for a 
deputy prime ministership. There are plans for three deputy 
prime ministers. One will be in charge of the financial and 
economic team of the government and of foreign debt matters, 
another deputy prime minister without portfolio will oversee the 
reform processes and especially the progress of land reform 
(Prime Minister Berov already nominated Associated Professor 
Rumen Gechev for this job), and a third one will deal with the 
social sector and no changes are expected on this count, 
government spokesman Raycho Raykov told reporters today, 
obviously referring to incumbent Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev. 
  The government may well resign en bloc if parliament does 
not 
pass the moved amendments to the Privatization Act and a 
Bankruptcy Act, Mr. Matinchev told foreign diplomats today, 
according to the government spokesman. This is not a 
government's whim or wish to dictate terms but conditions set by 
the international financial institutions, Mr. Raykov emphasized. 
  Approval of the cabinet changes will require an affirmative 
vote of more than half of the MP's present and voting. 
Interviewed on national radio this morning, the leader of the 
Alternative Social Liberal Party (affiliated to the New Union 
for Democracy, a parliamentary faction formed by expellees and 
defectors of the Union of Democratic Forces -- SDS) Nikolay 
Vasilev said that the union will not take part in the vote on 
the cabinet changes. The Rally for Democracy (another faction 
of SDS expellees and defectors) will most probably refuse to 
support the structural and personnel cabinet changes proposed by 
Prof. Berov, according to Rally deputy leader Ruslan Semerdzhiev. 
  DPS spokesman Yunal Lyutfi said yesterday and today that 
when 
the changes are put to the vote, the government will get less 
support than in previous such votes. Personally, he believes 
that the government deserves one more chance. The DPS top 
leadership held a meeting today. Mr. Oktay told reporters that 
according to information which the movement has, the Chairman of 
the Committee of Tourism Prof. Emil Lozanov already has 
resigned. He also said that according to the DPS there are 
unclear questions concerning the future structure of the 
Committees of Tourism and Forestry. The government spokesman 
said that the stand on the Tourism and Forestry Committees has 
yet to be finalized. The structural changes matter more than 
the personnel ones, as far as the DPS is concerned, Mr. Oktay 
emphasized. 
  "The situation surrounding the government is getting more 
disturbing by the day," said SDS leader Filip Dimitrov after a 
meeting of the Union's top leadership. In his words, there is 
already public awareness that the government is unfit to perform 
its functions and bear responsibility. "The obvious 
impossibility to achieve understanding on the cabinet changes, 
which delays their introduction before parliament, makes the 
picture in the country only gloomier," Mr. Dimitrov went on to 
say. He did not specify the actions which the Union is planning 
to take in the coming days when Prime Minister Berov is expected 
to table the cabinet changes. According to Mr. Dimitrov, on 
Wednesday [11 May] the majority will be forced to have a say on 
the union's draft resolution to censure the Government's 
economic and financial policy. The SDS will hold a national 
conference on Saturday and Sunday [14-15 May]. At it, the union 
may decide to boycott parliament.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 11 May "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 11 (BTA) -- The press provides 
extensive comments on the forthcoming cabinet changes. Most 
dailies say that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov can hardly be 
expected to introduce the intended cabinet changes before 
parliament today, as promised in an interview last Sunday. 
DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), quotes 
Socialists' parliamentary floor leader Nora Ananieva as saying 
that the document which the prime minister gave to the 
parliamentary forces contained just outlines. Interviewed for 
TRUD, MP Osman Oktay of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) says that the prime minister has not 
convinced the DPS that Rumen Genchev, Prof. Berov's nominee as 
the third deputy prime minister, is competent for this office. 
"DPS disapproves of Gechev's nomination as deputy prime 
minister", STANDART NEWS says in a front-paged headline. 
According to DUMA, in most probability the DPS position is a 
bid for a deal involving influence in key departments. The DPS 
MP's, who are expected to meet with the prime minister on 
Thursday [12 May], oppose the BSP interference in the cabinet's 
overhaul and advised the prime minister against introducing the 
cabinet changes before parliament today, 24 CHASA writes. 
Referring to what are described as well informed sources, 
DEMOKRATSIYA cites former parliamentary DPS deputy floor leader 
Sherife Mustafa as saying that she would not support the prime 
minister's proposal for changes because "she does not want to go 
to prison together with Ahmed Dogan (leader of the DPS)". DUMA 
says that Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is the likely 
deputy prime minister, and MP Gospodin Atanasov of the New Union 
for Democracy (expelees or breakaways from the Union of 
Democratic Forces) will probably be nominated as the new 
minister of justice. "The Socialists describe Stoyan 
Aleksandrov's threat for some ministers resigning en bloc and 
his claim he could cope with Bulgaria's foreign debt problem 
alone as overdoing it," DUMA says. "They All Fell Out," reads 
the headline of an article in DEMOKRATSIYA which says that the 
BSP and the DPS will wait until the conference of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) is held. According to KONTINENT, the 
overhaul of the cabinet has been put off until May 18. "The 
second overhaul of the cabinet stands a good chance of entering 
the Guinness Book of Records as the most time- taking bargain 
ever in world practice," a signed commentary in KONTINENT says. 
An editorial commentary in 24 CHASA says that the tourist 
season and the cabinet overhaul seem to have a common fate: both 
ending before ever starting. DUMA writes in a commentary that 
both the prime minister and the parliamentary forces will 
benefit by protracting the overhaul. OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes 
President Zhelyu Zhelev as saying that he is skeptical about the 
cabinet overhaul. STANDART NEWS writes that MP's have opened 
negotiations on a new cabinet. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, May 6 (BTA) -- On the Day of the Bulgarian 
Army and its patron saint St. George, President Zhelyu Zhelev 
delivered a speech at a traditional fair outside Shumen 
(northwestern Bulgaria), at the foot of the cliff with the image 
of the Madara Horseman, popularly identified as St. George 
(actually, the image of a Bulgarian khan). The depoliticization 
of the Bulgarian Army, its transformation into an army which 
defends the state's interests, is one of the greatest 
achievements of democratic Bulgaria since 1989, he said. This, 
the president explained, paves the way for the creation of a 
national army proper, that would defend this country's 
independence and territorial integrity. 
  The reform in the Bulgarian Army is part of the general 
process of reforms in this country, the president pointed out. 
However, he added that in that Bulgaria "lags far behind." The 
delay of economic reforms not only prevents the finding of 
solutions to the most pressing social issues; it also prevents 
the creation of prerequisites and means for a radical reform in 
the armed forces, he said. 
  He also pointed out that national security is a top priority 
in Bulgaria's national interests, and the Bulgarian Army is one 
of the main pillars of national security. Although the 
diplomats will do everything possible to prevent Bulgaria from 
being drawn into a conflict, the army should be ready, if 
necessary, to defend this country's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, said the president. He believes that in the course of 
the reform the army should retain its fighting capacity and 
readiness. According to the president, the goal now is a new 
army: smaller in number, better trained, armed with less 
weapons, but of higher quality. The modernization of the army, 
the improvement of its fighting efficiency is a task to be taken 
on by the whole society, the president said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Marsh: "Ex-communists Embrace a </F>
Half-capitalist Bulgaria"] 
  [Text] In Bulgaria's transition to a market economy -- as 
in other former east bloc countries -- it is former senior 
communists and secret police officers who have been among the 
quickest to embrace capitalism. 
  "There is little doubt that communist capital is behind many 
of the leading entrepreneurs one sees in Bulgaria today," says a 
western observer. "They will tell you they founded their media 
empire with two typewriters in a one-room office. What they 
don't tell you is that the next week they somehow managed to 
raise a couple of million dollars." 
  Many of the self-styled "Group of 13", [G-13] the name given 
to the business lobby recently founded by the country's largest 
private companies, started business this way. Between them, the 
G-13 control a large part of the country's emerging private 
sector. Their empires include banks, insurance companies, stock 
exchanges, large trading and financial companies, real estate 
developments, television channels, and newspapers. Some G-13 
companies already have annual turnovers of more than $1bn (685m 
pounds). 
  Several G-13 executives were among those sent abroad in 
Bulgaria's "perestroika years" of the 1980s by the Bulgarian 
Intelligence Service, [BIS] the former regime's secret police. 
Bright young officers were sent to top business schools in 
Europe and the US or to work in foreign trade companies which 
were often used as conduits for Communist party slush funds. 
  The BIS aimed to step up its industrial espionage activities 
through a network ranging from Liechtenstein, Austria and 
Switzerland to Silicon Valley in the US. These included the 
diversion of embargoed high technology equipment and information 
to the then east bloc. 
  Once communism collapsed, former BIS employees with a 
foreign 
education and contacts, and alleged access to the regime's 
foreign bank accounts, were in a prime position to go into 
private business. 
  The G-13's kingpin is Mr Ivan Pavlov, head of Multi-Group, 
considered the most powerful of the G-13 companies. A former 
professional wrestler, Mr Pavlov married the daughter of the 
head of military counter-intelligence and worked with deposed 
dictator Todor Zhivkov's son-in-law as an art dealer in the 
1980s, before moving to Malta. There he traded scrap Soviet 
submarines with, he says, Turkish financing. 
  Once back in Bulgaria he expanded into metal and oil 
trading, 
agro-businesses and providing security services. Multi-Group 
now employs 3,500 in 50 local comuanies including a bank, 
insurance company, the country's most active stock exchange and 
a sugar plant recently purchased from the state in one of the 
country's biggest privatisation deals to date. 
  Mr Pavlov is also believed to control nine casinos, seven in 
Bulgaria and two in Paraguay. Until recently, one of 
Multi-Group's "consultants" was Mr Emil Doynov, a former 
business associate of the late British publisher Robert Maxwell 
and brother of Oguyan Doynov, a senior communist-era minister. 
The Doynov brothers are widely held to be behind Multi-Group. 
  Many consider that Multi-Group and other similar G-13 
companies operate on the fringes of the law, gaining positions 
through their contacts in political circles and in the state 
enterprise sector, which still accounts for 90 per cent of 
industrial production. 
  One well-used scam is for privately-owned trading companies 
to over-charge state companies for raw materials or buy products 
cheaply and sell them on with a big mark-up. Another common 
practice is for companies to operate through offshore 
subsidiaries to avoid local regulations and to qualify for tax 
and other benefits reserved for foreign investors. 
  The government is belatedly taking steps to crack down on 
fraud and to strengthen tax administration after a 50 per cent 
shortfall in expected revenues last year. However, Mr Dimitar 
Kostov, the deputy finance minister, says: "There are 
suggestions that not all the methods used by G-13 companies are 
legal. We do not have facts that they are avoiding tax. 
Rather, they are finding legally-based incentives." 
  He also denies that the G-13 are as powerful or as dangerous 
as they are made out to be. But many in business and diplomatic 
circles fear that their activities set a bad precedent in a 
country which is already lagging behind in implementing reform 
and where many are ambivalent about the transition to a market 
economy. There is also concern that G-13 companies, which, 
fearing foreign competition, have started a campaign to protect 
"national capital", are prepared to sabotage efforts by foreign 
companies to participate in privatisation or invest in Bulgaria. 
  A western banker in Sofia says: "These companies have the 
power to poison the scene, the ability to buy politicians. 
There is clearly a need for regulation before it is too late. 
Today these guys work in broad daylight; in five years' time it 
will be much more difficult to trace their tracks and 
connections."

  [Text] Sofia, May 7 (BTA) -- "While the Brussels Treaty 
provides no security guarantees for Bulgaria and the other 
countries granted enhanced status of affiliated Western European 
Union (WEU) members, I believe the certainty that any moment 
this country could bring up issues related to its national 
security before the WEU Council of Ministers is a major step 
toward our integration into the European security structures," 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov this evening said in an 
interview for the Panorama weekly political programme of the 
national TV. His commentary came to answer the interviewer's 
question whether the enhanced status Bulgaria will be granted on 
May 9 will provide greater security. 
  Commenting on the Council of Europe (CE) Committee of 
Ministers presidency this country will take over on May 11, 
Foreign Minister Daskalov said it is a great responsibility and 
a prestige. "Bulgaria will be the first post-communist country 
to take the steering wheel of the Committee for a 6-months 
term," he said. During its tenure, Bulgaria will seek to further 
all major activities of the CE and particularly those 
implementing the decisions of the October 1993 summit in Geneva. 
  Asked whether Bulgaria's internal instability affects his 
international political contacts, the Foreign Minister said this 
country remains true to its foreign policy principles in spite 
of the domestic instability and that over the recent year it 
proved to have a clear orientation and priorities.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- "This is a friendly 
country, I've come to see friends" -- these were the first words 
on Bulgarian soil of Austrian Defence Minister Dr. Werner 
Fasslabend. He is visiting at the invitation of Bulgarian 
Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov as head of a delegation of 
the Austrian Federal Ministry of National Defence. The purpose 
of the visit is to specify the forms of future cooperation 
between the Defence Ministries and the armies of the two 
countries proceeding from the documents which have been signed 
so far. 
  "Cooperation between the military ministries of Austria and 
Bulgaria is very good: Their joint work is in the interest of 
the smaller European states. Promising achievements have been 
made and I am convinced that we will build a good relationship 
in a relatively brief period of time", Dr. Fasslabend said after 
his meeting with the Bulgarian defence minister. The two sides 
discussed the state of bilateral contacts and the political 
situation in the Balkans. "We tried to make a general 
assessment of the political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Kosovo and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. We established that the opinions of the two 
governments coincide on almost all issues," Dr. Fasslabend said. 
The situation in the former Yugoslavia is of great interest for 
both countries," Austria's defence minister told journalists 
today. The security of both countries depends to a great extend 
on finding an adequate solution to this problem, Dr. Fasslabend 
believes. 
  Though the relations between Bulgaria and Austria are not 
burdened by complicated historical circumstances, cooperation 
between the armies of the two countries till the fall of the 
totalitarian regime in 1989 was reduced to purely symbolical 
contacts because of the existing bloc structures in Europe.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] Speaking 
before journalists during a reception at the Austrian Embassy 
here yesterday, Austrian Defense Minister Dr. Fasslabend 
expressed Austria's high appreciation for Bulgaria's 
unquestionable contribution to the stability in the Balkans. 
Mr. Fasslabend stressed the significance the observation of the 
Yugo-embargo has for preventing an expansion of the conflict. 
He conferred on Defence Minister Aleksandrov a high Austrian 
award given for services rendered to Austria. Mr. Aleksandrov, 
the first foreign defence minister to receive this award, was 
decorated for his contribution in promoting the stability in the 
Balkans, Mr. Fasslabend said. The only person entitled to a 
higher award is the Austrian president, Austrian Embassy sources 
told BTA. Bulgarian Chief of General Staff Army General Lyuben 
Petrov and Major General Lyubomir Getchev, too, received awards 
for their contribution to the regional stability and bilateral 
cooperation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, May 10 (CTK) -- At their meeting today, the 
deputy chairmen of the government coalition parties failed to 
agree on a law which would put an end to the restitution 
process, Deputy Chairman of the Christian and Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) Jan Kasal told 
journalists. A KDU-CSL proposal concerning the restitution of 
church property was discussed and tasks were set which should be 
solved before a relevant resolution is discussed by the 
government. 
  The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) still insists that no more 
claims concerning the redressing of property injustices should 
be proposed, ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach said. He added that 
in the ODS's view the debate on the completion of restitutions 
had come rather late, though the coalition partners consider it 
to be premature. The issue of church property restitutions 
could be solved in an executive way in the framework of the 
existing laws, Vlach said. 
  It was agreed at the meeting that the issue of church 
property should be solved before a full stop is made to end 
restitutions, Deputy Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party 
(KDS) Miroslav Tyl said. He said the KDS was not concerned 
about the form in which church property was to be returned. It 
only insists that the return of church property be set down by 
law as firmly as was the restitution of property which has 
already been returned to its initial owners, he said. 
  ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky told CTK that the next 
coalition meeting on the same topic was to be held in a 
fortnight.

  [Text] Prague, May 10 (CTK) -- Net monthly income per 
member of households with a common budget averaged 2,809 
korunas, nominally 51 percent more than in 1988, but 19 percent 
less in real terms, according to a Czech Statistical Office 
report. The report, based on a "microcensus" of selected 
households carried out in March 1993, was made public yesterday 
at a press conference. Having collected data from 0.5 percent 
of Czech households, the office compared the results with a 
similar study undertaken in March of 1989. Cost of living 
indexes, which increased 88 percent between 1988 and 1992, were 
taken into account when determining real income. 
  Households headed by a businessman had an average monthly 
income per member in 1992 of 3,730 korunas; by a farmer, 3,419; 
by a wage-owner, 2,849; by a pensioner (with economically active 
household members), 2,773; by cooperative farmers, 2,500; and by 
a pensioner (with no economically active household members), 
2,445. The lowest income was reported by "other" households, 
usually headed by an unemployed individual, and by broken 
families living on child benefits -- 1,698 korunas. Real income 
decreased most for households headed by cooperative farmers -- 
31 percent -- and least for those headed by pensioners without 
economically active members -- 13 percent. 
  According to the data, differentiation increased both among 
the categories and within them. Just under three percent of 
households had incomes putting them under the poverty line at 
March 1993. Almost half of these were from the other households 
category.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) considers winning over 30 percent of votes in the 
first round of the elections as a major achievement, which has 
increased the Socialists' sense of responsiblity, Acting Deputy 
Chairman Imre Szekeres told MTI after the MSZP Presidium's 
session today. No matter what the second round brings, the MSZP 
has become a determining factor in Hungary's political life, he 
said. 
  The Presidium confirmed its previous position that coalition 
talks should only start after the second round. The Socialists 
underlined that such talks should be based on the compatibility 
of party manifestos.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- "Fate has given us 24 
hours to be dispirited; now this time has passed, we have no 
right to delay," Prime Minister Peter Boross, Deputy Chairman of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), told his party's National 
Board today. The senior party of Hungary's governing coalition 
won 11.3 percent of the votes cast on party list in the first 
round of the parliamentary elections on Sunday. (Four years ago 
the MDF scored 24.73 percent of votes in the first round.) The 
MDF now trails the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (33 
percent) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (19.76 percent) for 
third place. 
  Over the past four years, the MDF has accomplished a 
historic 
performance by laying down the constitutional foundations of 
multi-party parliamentary democracy and creating a legal 
background to transition to a social market economy, Boross 
said. The PM claimed the MDF had subordinated its interests and 
popularity to the needs of the country and the nation. 
  In a joint declaration, the MDF National Board warned 
against 
the danger of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) winning more than two thirds 
of seats and thus gaining excessive power, something undesirable 
in a parliamentary democracy. The Board calls upon all who want 
to halt this excessive win to support in the second round the 
100 MDF candidates still in contention. 
  The MDF hopes to create a political counterweight, to 
guarantee a controlled, democratic order of parliamentary 
decision-making. The Board proposed the MDF should start talks 
with the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) on 
second-round cooperation. The Board also proposed that the 
local MDF groups should make electoral deals with the Christian 
Democrats and the Smallholders, but should not negotiate similar 
deals with the Free Democrats.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- If voters allow, the 
national, Christian parties may make back some of their losses 
in the second round of voting on May 29, Laszlo Surjan, chairman 
of the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), said after 
his party's board took two sessions on Monday and Tuesday to 
assess the situation. 
  Surjan could imagine voters either becoming discouraged by 
the second round or realising they still have some political 
leverage. For this reason, the KDNP gives priority to mobilising 
voters and making them aware of their responsibility, he said. 
  KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga told MTI that the 
Christian 
Democrats have not yet coordinated second-round cooperation with 
any party. On Tuesday, they held an informal consultation with 
Hungarian Democratic Forum leaders. Varga added that the KDNP 
Executive Committee would decide tomorrow under which terms the 
party would be prepared to make an electoral deal for the second 
round.

Milewski expressed his satisfaction with the re-establishment of 
Polish-Chinese military relations after having met with the 
chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army General Zhang Wannian, who has begun a three-day official 
visit in Poland. 
  According to Milewski the Chinese official's visit to Poland 
and the fact that "China is noticing us" proves that "great 
China wants to develop cooperation with us and we are open to 
this." He added that the 38 year-long break in relations in 
this sphere may be regarded as being wasted time.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- In the evening of 
10 May President Ion Iliescu of Romania offered an official 
dinner in honor of Albanian President Sali Berisha and of the 
delegation that accompanied him on his visit to Bucharest. On 
this occasion Presidents Ion Iliescu and Sali Berisha held 
toasts. 
  In his toast, the head of the Romanian state said that 
"after 
the instatement of democratic regimes in our countries, 
favorable conditions were put in place for the Romanian-Albanian 
relations." In his opinion, the political treaty and the other 
cooperation documents to be signed during the Albanian 
president's visit express the political will of the sides for a 
fruitful long-term cooperation. 
  Mentioning Romania and Albania's concern about the conflict 
tearing apart the former Yugoslav space, the head of the 
Romanian state said: "It is sad that momentary circumstances, 
generated by the dismemberment of former Yugoslavia, that 
certain resentments, some of them probably motivated, should lie 
at the root of a tragedy and be now the greatest hurdle in the 
way of a political settlement in the area." The Romanian 
president underlined that Romania pronounces for a rational and 
responsible attitude on the part of all the leading factors in 
the area so that confrontation is renounced. President Iliescu 
pleaded for further support to the efforts of the international 
community in achieving peace. "The alternative to peace, to 
dialogue is cannot be but the extension of the conflict with 
enormous suffering for the peoples of former Yugoslavia and the 
risk of involving other states," the president of Romania said, 
who also reiterated Romania's "firm support for the actions 
directed towards finding a political solution, for the 
reinstatement of trust and understanding." "We wish to give the 
Romanian-Albanian relations a new impetus, to act in such a way 
as to forge exemplary economic, political, cultural, and 
spiritual ties between our peoples," the president of Romania 
also said.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- Romanian Minister 
of State Mircea Cosea appreciated as a success the stabilization 
of the leu exchange rate reached in April as much valuable as it 
had been achieved without "traumas or big commotions." In an 
interview with the Romania Radio, Vacaroiu cabinet's reform 
minister Mircea Cosea said the stabilization process would 
continue till June, the current year, when the inter-bank market 
is scheduled to be established. Cosea opined the success 
belonged to a fruitful cooperation between Government and the 
National Bank of Romania "extremely well valued abroad" and the 
"final" condition on the IMF stand-by loan. 
  Referring to the stage of privatization, Cosea said the 
so-called "30 percent" action would be finalized within the 
current month. The action will consist in the population's 
exchanging their property certificates -- previously granted to 
the population -- for shares in the commercial state companies 
amounting up to a total value of 30 percent of the commercial 
companies' aggregate capital. The Governmental Council of 
Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform -- headed by Cosea 
-- together with the National Privatization Agency, State 
Property Fund, and the (five) Private Property Funds are drawing 
up the details of the stock public offering. 
  Mircea Cosea gave as a proof of the increasing international 
recognition of the economic reform in Romania the invitation he 
had received in order to open and lead a conference organized by 
the specialized commission of the European Union for issues 
concerning the small and middle-sized enterprises.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- The Romanian 
Chamber of Deputies unanimously adopted, on 9 May, the draft law 
regarding the ratification of the convention on human rights 
defense and fundamental freedoms, as well as its additional 
protocols. By this convention -- adopted on 4 November 1950 and

-- as well as by the ten protocols added subsequently, several 
civil and political rights are guaranteed: the right to freedom 
and security of the individual, the right to an equitable civil 
and criminal trial, freedom of expression, the right to free 
elections and respect of property. 
  The adopted draft provides however under the following 
reserve: "The adoption of the convention shall not prevent 
Romania from putting into application the legal provisions 
through which military discipline is regulated and neither shall 
it impose additional financial obligations related to the 
private education system, others than those set under the 
domestic law". The convention has been previously adopted by 
Romania's Senate.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- The Egyutteles 
[Coexistence] movement has proposed the creation of a union to 
Slovakia's other three ethnic Hungarian parties, Egyutteles 
Chairman Miklos Duray said at a press conference today. The 
movement wants, along with its present coalition partner, the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH), and the 
non-parliament Hungarian Civic Party (MOS) and the Hungarian 
People's Party (MLS), to create a grouping legally bound to 
cooperate even after the autumn elections. 
  The advantage of a union rather than a coalition would be 
that the threshold needed to enter parliament would drop to five 
percent from the seven which would be needed by the coalition, 
Duray stated. 
  Under the election law, at least five percent of votes are 
required from a party to gain parliamentary seats, but seven 
percent for a coalition. Polls show that the MKDH-Egyutteles 
coalition enjoys support of seven to nine percent of voters, 
while the MOS has not a single percent of followers. 
  "We are now negotiating with the MKDH on the creation of the 
coalition. However, if all four partners agree to create a 
union, we will enter parliament as a single entity and form one 
group of deputies," Duray said, reacting to a question whether 
or not Egyutteles's new plans actually meant the rejection of an 
original idea of a trilateral coalition between the Egyutteles, 
the MKDH, and the MOS. 
  Observers say that Duray does not intend to enable MOS 
representatives to enter parliament thanks to their coalition 
with the Egyutteles and the MKDH without guarantees that the MOS 
will not later withdraw from the coalition to create its own 
group of deputies. 
  "The birth of the union would not mean the abolition of the 
legal status of the four partners," Duray insisted, in 
connection with the question of the different orientation of the 
ethnic Hungarian parties. He said the union, which would have 
its own statutes and political strategy, could serve more 
purposes than a coalition. The union would have its own name 
too, Duray said. However, this question would be solved only 
after an agreement concluded, he added. 
  The Egyutteles now has 9 seats and the MKDH 5 seats in the 
150- seat Slovak Parliament. About 560,000 ethnic Hungarians 
live in Slovakia, 11 percent of the country's population.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- Finance Minister Rudolf 
Filkus excludes the possibility that the government will put off 
solving Slovakia's basic economic problems until after the 
upcoming elections. In an interview with CTK today, Filkus said 
that the Moravcik government had already promised when it 
assumed power to continue economic reform despite the great 
political risk involved. Filkus commented that while it was not 
possible for all economic problems to be immediately resolved, 
the government would handle individual cases. 
  According to Filkus, the repeated shelving by the Slovak 
Government of the proposal to improve the insolvency of 
companies is one of the reasons for the current depth of the 
problem. "If we want to help insolvent companies we have to come 
with a bag of money, and that we don't have," he said. But 
despite this, Filkus expects economic renewal through an influx 
of foreign capital and privatization.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- Ondrej Hanko, spokesman 
for the shadow cabinet of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) described as an 
"extraordinary press conference of victims" a meeting of 
representatives of companies whose privatization projects 
approved in February and March have been canceled. 
  The new Slovak Government of Premier Jozef Moravcik canceled 
on March 29, due to legal and factual shortcomings, 13 of the 45 
privatization projects approved by the government of ex-premier 
and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar at a time when its remaining 
at power was already questionable. At that time the projects 
were also questioned by the media because the ex-premier's 
co-workers and their relatives were to participate in the 
projects. 
  However, "the harmed entrepreneurs" at today's meeting 
maintained that the privatization projects were legally correct 
and were canceled for political reasons on minor pretexts.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
today approved the bill which, in accordance with demands of 
ethnic minorities and Slovakia's commitments towards the Council 
of Europe, will introduce the use of bilingual 
(Slovak-Hungarian) geographical signs in regions with strong 
Hungarian minority population. If the law is passed by 
Parliament, towns and villages in which ethnic minority makes up 
at least 20 percent of the population will have bilingual signs. 
  Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner told journalists after a 
cabinet meeting that the law would concern some 560 towns and 
villages. Their names in the ethnic minority languages would be 
set down in a special list. Deputy Premier Ivan Simko said that 
the names had been studied by experts but Hungarian minority 
parties had not been asked for their views as they would be able 
to express them in Parliament. 
  The Slovak Parliament rejected the "names law" this January 
with Hungarian deputies also voting against it because only 
towns and villages with a 30 percent minority population would 
have had the right to a bilingual name. There have also been 
disputes about the very names in the Hungarian, with the Slovak 
side trying to avoid names reminiscent of the Hungarization of 
Slovakia in the past century or of Horthy's occupation of 
southern Slovakia during World War Two. 
  The dispute over the law on names culminated with taking 
down 
of signs with the Hungarian names of towns and villages in 
southern Slovakia last October, ordered by former Minister of 
Transport and Communications Roman Hofbauer on the basis of a 
1990 law which did not allow bilingual signs generally used 
during the first Czechoslovak Republic. The Council of Europe 
recommended that the Slovak Republic settle the dispute by 
legislative means. Pittner said today that the bill approved by 
the government met the demands set by the Council of Europe and 
corresponded to the Slovak Constitution. 
  The Slovak Government also complied with the demands of the 
half-million Hungarian minority last week, when it approved the 
bill enabling ethnic minority members to use first names and 
surnames in their original form. Hungarian women would not have 
to add the Slovak -ova suffix to their surnames. The passage of 
such a bill, which is to be approved by Parliament, is one of 
Slovakia's most important commitments towards the Council of 
Europe. The fulfillment of these commitments is to be assessed 
by the CE Secretariat at its meeting on May 17 in Warsaw.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- The Slovak 
Constitutional Court today rejected a request, made by ex-Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar's government in the middle of January, 
that it start work on the allegedly major discrepancies between 
the screening (lustration) law and the Slovak Constitution. 
  During its term of office, Meciar's government was 
frequently 
criticized by the then opposition for being dilatory in applying 
the screening law and for using it expediently for political 
ends. As premier, Vladimir Meciar said on several occasions 
that there were 235 Slovaks occupying important posts who had 
received certificates showing them to be former agents or 
collaborators of the Communist secret police. In the 1992 
election campaign, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
promised to abolish the screening law, but it never took this 
step in parliament and in the end the government decided to deal 
take the issue to the Constitutional Court. 
  Meciar's cabinet said the screening law was, to its full 
extent, at odds with the Slovak Constitution because it 
discriminated against certain categories of persons, did not 
respect the presumption of innocence and the need for cases to 
be judged by an independent court. 
  At its session today in Kosice, east Slovakia, the 
Constitutional Court's board declined to deal with the proposal 
of the since fallen government, since it said the court had 
already made a decision on the matter once. 
  The present prime minister, Jozef Moravcik, announced 
recently that after appointing the new government he had asked 
for its members to be screened. The results are to be made 
known in several weeks' time. The Slovak press is already 
saying that Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi may be having 
problems with screening positive. Magvasi, however, insists 
that his conscience is clear and connects the whole "affair" 
with his disputes with government colleagues over privatization. 
  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told CTK today that the governing 
coalition was considering amending the screening law, but was 
waiting for the Constitutional Court's verdict before making a 
decision. "It has started to be asked how long the validity of 
the screening law should last, and some are of the opinion that 
this time should be shortened," Kovac said.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sokol Terihati; passages within </F>
quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] Sixty-eight strikers -- representatives of 24 
villages with approximately 5,000 families from the Kukes and 
Has districts -- today entered the fifth day of their hunger 
strike. They are striking for economic reasons and because of 
the extremely difficult situation created years ago by the 
construction of the Fierze Hydroelectric Power Station. As a 
result of the continuation of the strike, the strikers' health 
is deteriorating. So far two have been taken to the city 
hospital, while four others are receiving medical treatment in 
the hall where the strike is being staged. Jahir Trota, strike 
committee chairman, told television the following: 
  [Trota] "Our demands are for annual rent for the land on 
which the Fierze Hydroelectric Power Station stands; financial 
compensation for the flooded areas rather than securities; 
compensation for the value of the houses, which has been denied 
us; money for the fruit trees and other real estate property 
created with our labor; the organized evacuation of part of the 
population, which is at a subsistence level; assistance with 
long-term credits facilitating conditions for new buildings; the 
purchase of buildings; and the development of private 
enterprise." 
  Deputy Chairman Hakik Sopi had this to say: 
  [Sopi] ``The Fierze lake has taken away our land. Under 
conditions of a market economy, we have no land today. Land is 
the most sacred thing for every citizen and nation. We are 
forced to see people in a miserable economic situation with no 
bread when they all used to work for state enterprises, which 
have now been privatized. We were an agricultural enterprise. 
The agricultural cooperatives took the land that we had before, 
so we are left without. Worst hit are the villages of Gosil, 
Kenete, Rahac, Kukes, and Drinas. The land that has remained 
does not even have any olive trees. In the forest, you cannot 
even keep one cow. The land has been open for agriculture. 
  ``We ask that during these days and without delay, the 
government should meet and decide on the fate of 30,000 
inhabitants, how they are to survive, as well as issue a 
government decision to consider the views of our 
representatives, our association leaders, who are present 
there.'' 
  We also interviewed Faik Kastrati, representative of Has 
district: 
  [Kastrati] "Our vital problem is economic, because under 
current conditions there is no way for us to live. In general, 
the Kukes and Has areas are isolated in several respects, but 
mainly economically, and we are suffering every day and our 
wishes are impossible to realize. We have persistently been 
putting forward these points, which are now publicly known, and 
ask that they be satisfied in every respect. Otherwise, we are 
at a very critical stage of survival." 
  [Unidentified striker] "We ask that the government helps us. 
We are 20 families who are now living in Kamez, in Tirana. I 
have 10 children. I am living in a hut in Kamez, with no water, 
no electricity, nothing. No one knows how our days have passed 
and will pass. That is why I am asking the government and all 
the state bodies to solve these problems of the strikers, 
regarding the life of the children, as our children are in such 
difficult conditions that they cannot live." 
  For the hunger strike to end, the strikers want the 
government to make some decisions, accept their demands, and 
release three representatives of the association that represents 
the interests of the inhabitants of these areas.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "Central European </F>
Initiatives"] 
  [Text] It was not until after I returned from South America 
that I was able to read methodically the newspaper commentaries 
on the meeting involving the presidents in Litomysl and on my 
alleged nonparticipation in their talks. 
  I would just like to say, on the margin, that I was not 
invited to any "talks" in Litomysl. Incidentally, this would 
have been inappropriate at an exclusive meeting of presidents. I 
was invited to a concert (and one cannot talk there) and to a 
dinner (and, despite the many interpreters, one can only talk to 
one's immediate neighbor). Given the sudden emergence of a whole 
series of problems just before my visit to South America (the 
talks on the jurisdiction of the regions were held in my office 
late on the Friday [15 April] evening at the time of the 
Litomysl dinner), I gave intentional priority to an apology and 
chose to deal with the matters that, at the given moment, 
especially after the morning meeting of the Coalition Four, I 
considered to be the most pressing. It seems pointless to me to 
continue speculating about this. 
  However, the very idea of Central Europeanness, which was 
declined in all its cases in the media after the meeting, is 
something else. 
  I would like to publicly acknowledge my Central 
Europeanness. 
Indeed, I feel that neighboring countries are closer to us than 
the countries that are not our immediate neighbors, that we are 
linked to them by thousands of visible and invisible and 
conscious and unconscious ties, and -- at the same time -- I am 
convinced that the policy of the current Czech Government 
corresponds precisely to this. Emphasis on these neighborly 
relations is enshrined in its policy statement of July 1992 and 
most of our foreign visits are made to these countries. 
Everyone who wants to know knows that, five days before 
Litomysl, I held day-long talks (and I emphasize talks and not a 
concert!) with Prime Minister Pawlak of Poland, that my previous 
foreign policy meeting was with German Social Democratic Party 
Chairman Scharping (the hot favorite for the post of German 
chancellor), and that the two most recent "prime ministerial" 
letters I wrote were to our neighbors -- to Bavarian Prime 
Minister Stoiber (about the oil pipeline from Ingolstadt) and to 
Saxon Prime Minister Biedenkopf (about Czech involvement in the 
only engineering enterprise in Erfurt). I cannot accept, 
therefore, criticism of my lack of Central Europeanness. 
  I even think -- more strongly than some other Czech 
politicians -- that there is something in Central Europeanness, 
that there is really something specific about this region, that 
it has a common historical experience, a common cultural 
heritage, and -- last but not least -- some common contemporary 
problems, and that it would perhaps be possible to retrieve 
something positive from all of this. The somewhat strange idea 
of the Pentagonal (for example, Italy with its Sicily and 
Sardinia is hardly part of Central Europe) did not play this 
role and, similarly, I am not sure whether the institution 
called the Central European Initiative has a real chance of 
playing any historic role. 
  Despite this, I would be willing to try something. When I 
was preparing to go to Budapest last July to attend a meeting 
involving the prime ministers of the 10 Central European 
Initiative countries, true to my beliefs, I said that it does 
not make sense to rattle off a couple of courteous phrases 
prepared in advance and then calmly return home again. 
Therefore, I prepared phrases by which I asked: Do we want to 
take our Central Europeanness seriously or not? Do we want to 
derive something from it on an institutional level? Do we want 
to assert our "Central European" attitudes -- if they exist -- 
on other forums? If the answer is yes, I am willing to go into 
this, if the answer is no, then let us stick to the cordial 
dinners and concerts. Our foreign minister talked me out of 
saying this by arguing that it could be interpreted as a step 
oriented against integration with the European Community. I 
respected this view and I delivered something like a "polite 
nothing." Everyone was satisfied. Even in the lobbies, where I 
tried out my Central European ideas with a little exaggeration 
and irony in my voice, it was clear that no one was interested 
in such a thing. 
  Let it be so. Then only good neighborly cooperation, which 
the Czech Republic is striving for on all forums, the attempt to 
obviate possible disagreements and conflicts, the maximum 
possible openness of the borders, and freeing and facilitating 
as much as possible the flow of people, ideas, cultural values, 
goods, money, and capital remain. I have the feeling that, in 
this sense, the Czech Republic has a good conscience. We are 
negotiating calmly with Slovakia, without dramatic threats, 
about recognizing the undisputable Slovak debt that evolved with 
the break up of the Federation. We are not the ones 
complicating the Customs Union, we are not the ones slowing down 
the completion of the process for establishing a free trade zone 
with Poland and Hungary, we are not protesting against this or 
that project in Austria, we are not sending alarming signals 
about the Sudeten Germans, and so on and on. 
  Nevertheless, we have to talk to each other as much as 
possible. In this sense, the meeting in Litomysl certainly 
played a positive role.

<F P=106> ["(mst)"-signed report: "Ruml Does Not Want a Deputy From </F>
the Christian Democratic Party"] 
  [Excerpt] Prague -- Interior Minister Jan Ruml declared 
yesterday that he does not need another deputy in his ministry. 
He was replying to a question on whether he accepts the demand 
from Christian Democratic Party [KDS] Deputy Chairman Vaclav 
Benda for one of the deputy interior minister's posts for his 
party, a post that -- according to Benda-- should compensate the 
KDS for the fact that his party did not obtain the post of 
attorney general. The interior minister declared that, at the 
moment, he has three deputies from the coalition parties and 
Deputy Minister Fendrych, "whom he needs." According to Jan 
Ruml, he does not need to increase the number of deputy 
ministers merely to satisfy the ambitions of certain people from 
the KDS. 
  Nevertheless, Ruml admitted that the KDS has a claim to this 
post in accordance with the coalition agreements. If, however, 
coalition representatives begin to negotiate on a potential 
deputy interior minister from among the ranks of the KDS, Jan 
Ruml intends to "enter very forcibly" into these negotiations.

<F P=106> ["jb"-signed report: "Report on Dukovany Is Not Secret"] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- The report on the results of activities 
of the State Bureau for Nuclear Safety (SUJB) in 1993, described 
as secret by the Austrian weekly NEWS, was discussed by the 
Czech Government on 6 April, and reporters were briefed about it 
at a news conference. Ladislav Bartak, director of the SUJB 
Nuclear Materials Section, told LIDOVE NOVINY about this 
yesterday. He emphasized that the report on the results of the 
activities of the bureau is available to any interested party. 
He explained that only three of the 315 incidents registered by 
the SUJB at the Dukovany nuclear power plant in 1993 were marked 
level one on the INES [International Nuclear Event Scale] 
international scale, and this level does not represent a danger 
to nuclear safety, but rather a deviation from the officially 
authorized operational regime. One hundred and two incidents 
were denoted zero -- insignificant for nuclear safety. The 
remaining incidents are not even registered on the INES scale. 
The international scale has eight degrees (0 to 7). The 
Chernobyl disaster was assessed as degree seven.

<F P=106> [Interview with Miroslav Hrehor, Czech State Bureau for </F>
Nuclear Safety press spokesman, by Cestmir Klos; place and date 
not given: "Nuclear Experts Held Talks With Austrians"] 
  [Text] Discussions appeared in the daily press on the 
article carried by the Austrian weekly NEWS that commented 
critically on the allegedly top secret report by the Czech State 
Bureau for Nuclear Safety (SUJB) on the execution of the state 
supervision of nuclear safety. At the same time, the 
approximately 30-member Czech-Austrian commission of nuclear 
experts met in Prague. LIDOVE NOVINY learned of this session and 
asked the SUJB press spokesman, Secretariat Director Miroslav 
Hrehor, for information. 
  [Klos] Was the critical atmosphere surrounding the 
aforementioned article the reason for the meeting, and was it 
kept secret? 
  [Hrehor] Neither our report nor our meeting was kept secret. 
According to unofficial sources, President Havel even passed the 
report to [Austrian] President Klestil. The expert meeting was 
called in an ordinary manner on the basis of the bilateral 
treaty of October 1989. The first part of the meeting took 
place in Vienna in March, and the Prague continuation was 
necessitated by numerous joint problems. The article would not 
have been mentioned at the session, were it not that I learned 
about it from you. At the request of the Austrian party, we 
agreed beforehand not to issue any final press statement from 
the session, and therefore it was not necessary to inform about 
the meeting taking place. 
  [Klos] Does it mean that no binding resolution will be 
issued from the meeting? 
  [Hrehor] It is no secret that the Czech and Austrian 
opinions on the use of nuclear energy differ. The objective was 
not to write a protocol on where we agree but rather to explain 
to each other our disparate stands. I can say without 
exaggeration that the talks were useful, accommodating, and 
fruitful. They resulted in numerous recommendations -- the 
Austrian request, for instance, that various working teams be 
formed and some documentation be provided. I do not see any 
reason not to accommodate them, but we cannot promise anything 
until the CEZ [Czech Power Generating Works] Company provides 
its comments. We can initiate such a cooperation with that 
firm, but cannot order them to do it. 
  [Klos] What were the main topics of the talks? 
  [Hrehor] They were the completion of Temelin, the location 
of the storage for the spent fuel, the overall radiation 
situation, the monitoring of radiation on the territory of both 
republics, and the explanation of mutual problems linked to 
nuclear power generation. I consider it necessary to emphasize 
that the experts tried to keep to the technical basis of the 
problems and avoid politicizing the discussion. They succeeded 
here, although the diverse spectrum of opinion of the Austrian 
delegation included radical critics of the use of nuclear power.

<F P=106> ["(mrk)"-signed report: "Millions for the Ethnic Press"] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- Almost 20 million korunas was earmarked 
from the state budget in 1993 to support the publication of the 
ethnic press. This is apparent from the report that I. Nemec, 
minister and chairman of the Council for Ethnic Minorities, 
submitted to the government last week. A total of 12 ethnic 
publications received support -- three Polish, three Romany, two 
German, two Slovak, one Hungarian, and one Ukrainian. Apart 
from this, the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Physical 
Training is still subsidizing two Polish children's magazines. 
According to A. Sulitka, the Council for Ethnic Minorities' 
secretary, state support is an important condition, without 
which the ethnic press could not be published. Support is linked 
-- strictly purposefully -- to ensuring the publication of 
individual titles and is always granted to the civic association 
of the appropriate minority, which guarantees to publish the 
title. The amount of the subsidy depends on specific 
conditions: Publications from the Romany minority received the 
most support in 1993. Approximately the same amount as last 
year has been earmarked to support the ethnic press this year; 
the number of subsidized titles should also be the same.

<F P=106> [Report by Bogdan Markiewicz and DIK: "Walesa: Strikes </F>
Threaten the Country's Security"] 
  [Excerpts] After the 4 May session of the government 
on the defense system of the country, President Lech Walesa, who 
took part in it, said that strikes, particularly in the 
strategic branches of the economy, negatively affect the 
country's security. 
  According to the president, this should be regulated by law, 
through negotiations with the trade unions, that "not everyone 
strikes and not everyone must pay for strikes." Thus Lech 
Walesa, the symbol of the Polish strikes, has become their 
opponent today. 
  Everything seems to suggest, then, that increasingly more 
politicians in Poland come to the conclusion that staging a 
strike is not the best method of changing subsequent 
governments. Many stress that strikes fulfilled their role in 
1988 because they were a weapon in the fight for changes in the 
political system. Today they are an obstacle in the economy 
which is striving to overcome the crisis. According to the 
president, the current strikes threaten the country's security. 
  When asked by TRYBUNA whether the president's statement 
might 
mean that the President's Office is conducting work on a draft 
law which would limit the right to strike, especially in areas 
that are strategic for the country, Minister Andrzej Drzycimski 
stated that Lech Walesa directed the question to the unionists 
and to the government, and that he is waiting for a response. 
  As we found out unofficially in the Office of the Council of 
Ministers, so far no work has been conducted on a draft law 
restricting the right of the employees of the strategic sector 
to stage a strike. 
  Asked for a comment on the president's statement, Marian 
Krzaklewski, chairman of the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union "Solidarity" ["S"], said that Lech Walesa would define his 
attitude toward strike actions by signing or not signing the new 
popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. On the previous 
day the "S" leader stated that it would be one of the last 
chances for the president. [passage omitted] 
  Wit Majewski, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions 
Agreement, commenting on the president's statement, said that it 
is not known what the president was thinking when he mentioned 
strategic branches. "Well, it is obvious that every branch 
influences the stability, security, and defense system of the 
country. I understand that the president means chiefly the 
power industry, transport, and the defense industry. One can 
start negotiations on limiting the right to stage strikes in 
these branches --- however, only if we were able to guarantee 
wages and good work in these sectors." 
  In Poland there are certain limitations in the rights to 
strike. They comprise the Office of State Protection, police, 
the Armed Forces of the Polish Army, Prison Services, and the 
Border Troops. The law on the settlement of collective 
bargaining also includes a provision saying that it is 
inadmissible to stop work as a result of strike actions in 
workplaces with machines and installations where such a stoppage 
threatens lives or the health of people, or where the country's 
security is jeopardized. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Lost President"] </F>
  [Text] Three weeks after announcing a truce with the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], President Lech Walesa seems to 
be lost. Not unlike the period immediately following 
parliamentary elections, he does not seem to have any idea as to 
how he should coexist with the governing coalition. 
  The president is not used to a situation in which he must 
impose limits on himself, because some spheres up high are 
excluded from the set of issues that can be disputed. 
  Since meeting with the SLD Club, Walesa has been linked to 
the governing coalition by a network of interdependent 
relations. He keeps the promises made to the coalition (he has 
forwarded his draft constitution, his representative will 
participate in the work of the committee, SLD is taking over the 
deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries). 
However, he apparently does not feel very comfortable in this 
new situation. 
  This was quite obvious at a meeting with the Non-Party Bloc 
in Support of Reforms [BBWR] in Szczecin, and at a meeting of 
the Accord Forum in Gdansk, where Walesa did not have much to 
say to his supporters. The official truce with SLD, concluded 
before television cameras, has invalidated the main thesis that 
he wanted to talk about during his tour of the country. 
  In addition, on some issues Walesa and SLD simply have 
"similar goals." For example, the National Council of Radio and 
Television [KRRiT] and public television in general. It cannot 
be ruled out that Walesa will achieve what he has not been able 
to achieve in any other way -- by appealing to the honor (of 
three KRRiT members and requesting that they hand in their 
resignations), through the method of "extending" the law 
(recalling Chairman Marek Markiewicz from his function), by 
expressing his dissatisfaction (Wieslaw Walendziak). Unless 
there is some change here (one cannot exclude the possibility 
that Walesa will not start defending KRRiT and Walendziak from 
the "conquest intentions" of SLD), SLD will make changes that 
the president will approve. 
  The president's helplessness is becoming increasingly 
noticeable. Recently he has rarely had a chance to make a 
decision which to some degree would concern the governing 
coalition. He was the one to decide what should be done with 
the amendment to the law on the procedures for preparing and 
adopting the constitution. However, he really could not veto it 
-- because he had made a deal with Kwasniewski that the 
constitution issue would be excluded from any conflict areas, as 
well as because the bill includes a provision concerning a 
legislative initiative that he had been trying to pass. 
  Soon, after the Sejm makes its decision, he will decide the 
issue of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. 
He will be able to take advantage of this decision as a 
propaganda move. If he vetoes it, he will earn the gratefulness 
of "Solidarity." 
  The president has not been very successful recently in 
dealing with several issues. He was very active, and his 
behavior even had the characteristics of an election campaign. 
However, opinion polls suggest that exactly in the period of 
this activeness, his popularity was on the wane. Waldemar 
Pawlak turned out to be disloyal, by announcing 
self-governmental elections in line with the old Electoral Law 
and not waiting for the president to query the new one. 
Moreover, it turns out that Walesa cannot hope that someone 
will build a pro-presidential grouping for him, without his 
participation. BBWR is clearly not able to cope with this and 
is just waiting for the president to get involved. Existing 
groupings are looking for candidates for president; however, for 
the time being none of them want to back Walesa. 
  Walesa cannot really rekindle an open conflict with the 
coalition soon because the promises which he has made are an 
obstacle here. Nor can he conclude a lasting peace with it 
because the president, who considers himself to be the guarantor 
of democracy, cannot make peace with a force which, according to 
him, threatens it. 
  However, it can be expected that the president's conflict 
with the coalition will last. If Walesa does not have other 
possibilities of making the coalition's life difficult, there 
will still be the word conflict. Just like there is now. 
Walesa speaks about the necessity of reaching a balance, he 
announces a "play-off." He has quite considerable possibilities 
here, including the one that he is already exploiting: 
Presenting the governing parties as a threat to democracy and 
himself -- as the defender of this democracy.

  [Text] Just under an hour ago, President Lech Walesa 
returned to Warsaw from his two-day visit to Estonia. Here is 
what he told newsmen at the airport: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What is the 
significance of the visit to Estonia? 
  [Walesa] I had to sort out matters in Europe. We have to 
take 
all opinions into account, because we are building democracy, 
after all, and on this road a revisit to Estonia was in order. I 
think that that country indeed has many possibilities, and it 
would be worth doing a bit of business with it. And I think 
that after my visit, some such business will be done. 
  [Reporter] Is cooperation with the Baltic states the 
direction for Poland and the central-eastern European states? 
  [Walesa] Well, it isn't the only direction, but it's 
nevertheless quite an important one. The Scandinavian route -- 
via the Baltics, as they call it -- the whole idea is a very 
good one, and I think Poland should join it as quickly as 
possible. [end recording]

  [Text] At its off-site session in Lansk, the Council of 
Ministers reached fundamental decisions on a socioeconomic 
strategy for Poland. The discussion was based on a draft 
socioeconomic policy program for 1994-97 prepared by the Central 
Planning Office. The policy drawn up by the government creates a 
basis for economic growth which will make it possible to 
increase the GDP in 1994-97 by more than 20 percent, a statement 
by the Government Press Office says. 
  The government program focuses on the development of human 
capital and an improvement in the people's material standard of 
living. The government has decided that an important supplement 
and expansion of the strategy for Poland is the midterm 
financial policy -- assumptions of which will soon be presented 
by the minister of finance and the Polish National Bank -- with 
regard to the state of our relations with international 
financial institutions. 
  Of similar importance will be a program of activities to 
improve security and law-observance, and restricting the so 
called gray market economy. 
  One component of institutional changes will be to implement 
a 
program of commercialization of state enterprises which will 
make it possible to move away from administrative control of pay 
levels. 
  The final decision by the Council of Ministers on submitting 
the draft socioeconomic program to the Sejm is to be made in 
June.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 10 (TANJUG) -- Since the beginning of 
the implementation of the country's economic recovery program at 
the end of January, Yugoslavia's foreign currency reserves have 
increased by 335 million German marks, it was said on Tuesday at 
a meeting of the Federal Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, with the 
prime ministers of Serbia and Montenegro, Mirko Marjanovic and 
Milo Djukanovic. 
  The Yugoslav Information Ministry said that the architect of 
the program and governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, 
Dragoslav Avramovic, also attended the meeting. According to 
the presented data, the National Bank of Yugoslavia has so far 
purchased foreign exchange to the value of 502 million German 
marks while it has sold around 167 million German marks to 
citizens and firms during the same period. 
  The meeting confirmed the strong determination that budget 
deficits should not covered by funds which have no foreign 
currency backing and that credits for the revival of the economy 
should not be approved if they are not covered as envisaged by 
the program. A real increase in production could be expected 
already this month, it was said at the meeting. 
  Money supply is still below the optimum level as compared 
with the achieved social product and interest rates have 
stabilized at the level of nine percent a year which is in 
accordance with the stabilization program, it was said at the 
meeting. The meeting pointed at difficulties occurring in the 
implementation of the program, primarily in the domain of prices. 
  The Federal Trade Ministry is in charge of analyzing price 
movements and urgently suggesting corresponding measures to the 
federal government.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Kovacic and M. Mikuljanac: "All the Balkans </F>
Are Serbia"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- Brother Serbs, do not retreat even an 
inch, do not retreat, but go forward and bear in mind that 
Russia, Moscow, and the Russian people are with you. This was 
stated by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, at the end of the rally held to mark 
Victory Day at Belgrade's Republic Square yesterday. 
  The rally, which the Belgrade police initially banned and 
then allowed and secured, was organized by the Serbian National 
Renewal [SNO] and was attended by several thousand Belgrade 
citizens. 
  The speakers and guests (14 members of the delegation of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, a few dozen SNO officials, 
the representatives of the RS [republic of Srpska] and the RSK 
[republic of Serbian Krajina], and two security teams) were 
standing on an improvised stage (a truck), in front of the 
monument to Knez Mihailo. They were surrounded by journalists, 
cameramen, and citizens, who wore uniforms and carried banners. 
Mirko Jovic (president of the SNO) and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
who were greeted and seen off with ovations, were the only ones 
who managed to change the acquiescent atmosphere, marked only by 
occasional chanting of "Russia" and "Serbia." 
  Mirko Jovic began his speech by saying that the 
"international community has taught the Serbs that the factual 
situation is more important than history, and therefore, after 
three years of war, the Serbian unification is an undisputable 
fact." 
  "Our country is now so large that you can spend 16 hours 
travelling in any direction, even with the best car. We know 
that you are envious," Jovic said addressing the West, "because 
the states that you support can be crossed in half an hour." 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (who Jovic introduced as the commander 
of the Russian and Serbian armies) also had messages ready for 
the countries of the Western Europe and the United States. 
"They must know that it is dangerous to go to the south and the 
east, because this could be their last war. If they continue 
attacks on the Slavs, we will be forced to use the entire 
Russian military potential. If they do not listen to the voice 
of reason, they will put their countries in an unenviable 
position," Zhirinovskiy predicted. Insisting that all foreign 
armies should leave the Balkans ("if any foreign army is to be 
here, this should then be the Russian army"), Zhirinovskiy said 
that the Serbs should themselves decide on their borders. 
According to them, "it would be appropriate if all the Balkans 
were Serbia." Zhirinovskiy promised Serbia every kind of help, 
including military, as soon as he comes to power. He told those 
gathered to "bolster the Orthodox fate and believe in victory." 
  The rally was also addressed by Biljana Plavsic (vice 
president of the RS), Branko Vojnica (chairman of the RSK 
Assembly), Veselin Djuretic, General Viktor Ustinov, Admiral 
Yevgeniy Busov, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (who ended his speech by 
saying "The Russians are coming"), and Dusan Krunic. Milan 
Gvero (deputy chief of staff of the RS Army), who was supposed 
to speak, did not speak. The rally was concluded by Bora 
Djordjevic with a song "The Night Is Dark." 
  Last night, the Russian delegation held talks with the 
representatives of the RS and RSK behind closed doors in the 
Bosanka villa.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 10 (TANJUG) -- The opposition Serbian 
Renewal Movement (SPO) on Tuesday assessed that lasting peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina required an immediate halt to all conflicts 
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina without any ultimatums and any 
promises to any side. President of the SPO Executive Board 
Milan Komnenic told a press conference that the party leader, 
Vuk Draskovic, on Monday familiarized the U.N. Secretary 
General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and the foreign ministers of 
Russia, the U.S., Great Britain, France and Greece, with 
proposals to resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In his letters to these officials, Draskovic pointed out 
that 
after the conflicts have ended, heavy weaponry of all the three 
warring sides (Moslems, Serbs and Croats) should be placed under 
UNPROFOR control -- and when this is over -- complete 
disarmament should be carried out. The leader of the SPO party 
which is the backbone of the Depos coalition, the strongest 
opposition group in the Serbian parliament, suggested in his 
letters the soonest possible holding of a summit of the heads of 
state of Russia, the U.S., France and Great Britain, and the 
chair-country of the European Union, Greece, and the U.N. 
secretary general who would send demands to all the warring 
sides to submit themselves to this summit's decisions. 
  Bosnian Serbs advocate an end be put to all the conflicts 
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has not been accepted by 
the Bosnian Moslems who propose termination of conflicts on some 
of the battlefronts or a truce of up to two or three months.

  [Text] As it is known, due to Italy's objections, Slovenia 
was not admitted into the so-called E-10 group last week, which 
is a group of former socialist countries that are partners to 
the G-7 group of the most developed nations. This morning, 
Economics and Development Minister Davorin Kracun, who headed 
the Slovene delegation at this meeting, spoke about what 
actually happened at the Warsaw summit. At the same time he 
explained the progress of our negotiations to join GATT. Drago 
Flis reports: 
  [Begin Flis recording] The E-10 group is relatively young. 
It pools new Eastern and Central European countries, among 
which Slovenia is still an observer for the time being. At the 
East-West conference in Warsaw, where Slovenia was represented 
by Economics and Development Minister Davorin Kracun, Slovenia 
displayed great interest in membership in the E-10 group, 
however, this was blocked by Italy, whose representative -- the 
charge d'affaires in the Italian Embassy in Warsaw -- cited 
instructions from Rome. 
  This, of course, cannot signal an endless Italian objection, 
because other countries, including the United States and 
Germany, have no objections to Slovene membership, but, on the 
contrary, emphasize that the Slovene economic policy is one of 
the most successful among the new countries, that is to say, the 
countries in transition. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Brown 
promised Kracun that Slovenia will become a full-fledged E-10 
member at the next session of the East-West conference, which 
will be hosted by the United States, and this group will thus 
turn into an E-11 group. 
  The countries are preparing a partnership for development 
plan, which is supposed to be a sort of an economic equivalent 
to the military Partnership for Peace plan. According to some 
estimates, $200 billion of direct investments from the old, that 
is, developed nations gathered in the top G-7 group awaits the 
new countries within this scheme. Naturally, the new countries 
will need to be open for this, too. 
  Slovenia is also negotiating with the still existant GATT, 
which will transform itself into the world trade organization, 
WTO. In the opinion of Minister Kracun, our country has now 
reached a favorable regime of protection of our own economy. 
For example, in agriculture, which is the most sensitive 
department, GATT consented to Slovenia allowing only a minimal 
access to our agricultural market, which will be 3 to 5 percent, 
with the continued existence of lists of goods, quotas 
[preloman], and a 27 percent tariff that will, of course, 
continue to protect domestic agriculture. 
  Slovenia will observe the new norms of international trade 
in 
industrial imports, where the highest tariff is supposed to be 
27 percent, while for many items the new tariff will be lower, 
Minister Kracun said, among other things. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Whose Waters Are Being Disturbed </F>
by the Ethnic Albanian Census in Macedonia?"] 
  [Text] The ethnic Albanian census in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] has been a topic of discussion for 
some time. It was initially planned to begin in late April, but 
thus far there have only been long meetings and endless debates. 
  The ethnic Albanians in Macedonia have demanded changes to 
the draft census law, particularly those provisions that 
encroach on the Albanians' right to declare themselves in their 
own mother tongue, in other words to fill in the census forms in 
the Albanian language. These requests have been supported also 
by the European Community, which has conditioned its funding for 
the census campaign upon their fulfillment. However, the 
Macedonian side does not agree, arguing that this would infringe 
Macedonia's constitution. It is actually the same constitution 
that the Albanians previously refused to vote for because it did 
not treat them as a nationality capable of statehood, as it does 
the Macedonians. Aside from the language issue, there are a 
number of other contentious clauses in the draft census law 
described as discriminating. Among other things, there is a 
fairly conspicuous attempt to classify Albanians into various 
subdivisions. Thus, Albanians presently living outside their 
native area for more than a year have to be registered in 
separate forms. Obviously, this differentiation is impervious to 
democratic logic and leaves room for falsification. Moreover, 
how can the final census figures be reliable when there is only 
one single Albanian working in the Macedonian Institute of 
Statistics? A single-nation statistics institution in a 
multinational state, can very easily issue whatever figures it 
chooses, in accordance with the political interests it 
represents. 
  The ethnic Albanian censuses carried out in Macedonia in the 
past have more often than not turned into a heated issue, as 
happened quite recently in the Skopje parliament. 
  The truth must come into the open without the slightest 
doubt. It is said that Albanians account for more than 40 
percent of the republic's entire population, although the 
Macedonians say this figure should be halved. Only a census 
carried out in accordance with international regulations will 
reveal the real truth. Artificial hurdles placed in the way of 
its realization serve neither the stability of the republic, nor 
peace and good understanding in the region. At a time when 
Macedonia has been put in a difficult position because of the 
Greek blockade in the south and the Serbian aims in the north 
(Milosevic ignores FYROM as a state to the point that he does 
not even mention Macedonia in his "Balkan federation project"), 
it would be suicidal for this country to incite artificial 
conflicts with the Albanians, who undoubtedly are a basic factor 
for stability in that country and in the region as a whole. 
  There is nothing that the ethnic Albanian census in 
Macedonia 
could disturb, aside from the chauvinistic waters whose sources 
can be traced to somewhere in Belgrade. Let us hope that reason 
will finally triumph, in the interests of the Macedonians, 
Albanians, FYROM, and the interests of tranquility and peace in 
the Balkan peninsula.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 9 (TANJUG) -- Josip Manolic, president 
of the upper house of the Croatian parliament, has disclosed 
that Zagreb has so far spent about one million German marks [DM] 
on the war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
thus confirming that more than 60,000 Croatian Regular Army 
troops are fighting there. Manolic, former chief of the 
Croatian secret police, says in his memoirs, which are being 
published in installments by the Zagreb paper GLOBUS, that about 
63-64,000 Croatian regular troops have taken part in the 
Moslem-Croat clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Tens of thousands of Croatian soldiers have been engaged in 
the Bosnian civil war since its outbreak in 1992. They have 
first fought within the allied Bosnian Moslem-Croat forces 
against the Serbs, but since last spring, they have been 
fighting with the Bosnian Croats against the Moslems. The 
United Nations have persistently ignored Serb warnings about 
Croatia's military engagement in the Bosnian war, but only after 
the outbreak of the Moslem-Croat territorial clashes last spring 
did U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali admit there were 
some 6,000 Croatian Regular Army troops also fighting in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "All those (Croatian) soldiers in Bosnia had to be paid as 
well as the ammunition and logistics costs. The war with the 
Bosnian Moslems has cost Croatia at least three million German 
marks a day, and as the war has lasted for nearly a year, the 
costs incurred to Zagreb can be estimated at about one billion 
marks," says Manolic. 
  Acting under pressure from the United States, the Bosnian 
Moslems and Croats in March signed a ceasefire and agreement on 
setting up a joint federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would 
subsequently enter a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. 
Manolic was among Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's closest 
associates and a member of the innermost leadership of the 
ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
  In April Manolic and Stipe Mesic, president of the lower 
house of parliament, publicly accused Tudjman and the HDZ of 
dictatorship, embezzlement and meddling in the Bosnian war with 
a view to creating "a greater Croatia" at the expense of the 
Bosnian territories. Manolic, Mesic and some other HDZ members 
have left the HDZ and set up a new party -- Croatia's 
Independent Democrats (HND).

  [Text] Belgrade, May 10 (TANJUG) -- The head of the 
Croatian Bureau in Belgrade Zvonimir Markovic said Tuesday [10 
May] that Croatia was interested in the opening of air corridors 
between Belgrade and Zagreb so that planes would not have to fly 
the roundabout way. He told this to the Yugoslav Minister for 
Transport and Communications Blagoje Lucic, the Yugoslav 
Information Ministry reported. 
  The question of the establishment of direct 
telecommunication 
links between Belgrade and Zagreb was also examined during the 
talks as well as the normalisation of road and rail traffic, 
following an agreement with the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). 
The RSK was declared by the Serbs on their ethnic ancestral 
lands in Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession 
from the former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of the Serb 
people to a national minority. 
  The head of the Yugoslav Bureau in Zagreb Veljko Knezevic 
said Monday that the Yugoslav Vice Premier Zeljko Simic and the 
Croatian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic would 
most probably meet at the end of May in Belgrade to discuss the 
possibility of the opening of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the 
establishment of rail and telecommonuciations links and the 
linking of Yugoslav and Croatian power systems. 
  All economic and political relations between Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) and Croatia were cut off in 1991 because of 
Zagreb's unilateral forcible secession from the Yugoslav 
Federation. The normalisation of political relations between 
the two countries began in March this year with the opening of 
the Yugoslav and Croatian bureaus in Zagreb and Belgrade 
respectively, which had been agreed in Geneva in January by 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and his Croatian 
counterpart Granic. According to the Yugoslav interpretation 
the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb in no 
way presupposes a political settlement in the RSK, which should 
be reached bilaterally by the Croatian and Krajina sides.

  [Text] The fourth day of the Bosniak-Croatian negotiations 
on implementing the Washington agreement ended late this 
evening. Tihomir Vinkovic reporting for the midnight bulletin of 
Croatian Radio from Vienna: 
  There has still been no agreement on the cantonal maps in 
the 
Bosniak-Croat federation. It seems that stands have been 
harmonized on the hitherto controversial issue of central 
Bosnia. The area is planned to be one whole canton organized on 
the parity principle to reflect the 1991 population census. 
Western Herzegovina is envisaged as a Croat canton and the 
eastern part of Herzegovina will also be organized on the parity 
principle. The negotiations will resume at 1000 on 11 May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by Arijana Saracevic in Sarajevo 
on 10 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [[Saracevic] I would like to start by asking you 
what we can expect from the talks in Vienna. 
  [Izetbegovic] The talks have been accompanied by many 
difficulties. The fact that they have already been going for 
four days shows that things are moving slowly. Anyway, this is 
not surprising if one knows how difficult the problems on the 
agenda are -- above all, the problem of the cantons. This is a 
very complex issue and, as you know, everyone was trying to 
avoid it, but it eventually had to be dealt with. There is also 
the problem of the future government of the federation -- that 
is, its structure and the allocation of cabinet posts. We also 
have to deal with the issue of free movement and free passage 
for our refugees. Finally, there is this issue of the 
presidency; who will be the first president? The two sides have 
differing views on this issue. 
  [Saracevic] It seems that the issue of the presidency of the 
federation is the most disputed one. At least, that is the 
impression one gets from the media. 
  [Izetbegovic] That seems to be the case from the Croatian 
point of view. They have been forcing this issue from the very 
beginning as the most important problem. That is why they came 
here on several occasions. I want to tell our public that from 
our point of view this is the least important issue when 
compared with the other problems I have just mentioned. We 
believe that it is much more important to draw up the correct 
maps of the cantons, to avoid any mistakes. Such mistakes would 
be permanent and incorrigible. 
  We also have to open the roads and let the refugees return. 
Our refugees are facing great difficulties when travelling 
through Croatia. Croatia introduced visas several days ago. 
Some people get them, and some do not, even though the main 
wave of refugees is yet to come. Individuals are having 
problems at the Croatian border and they are forced to go back. 
This stops the process of their return. This issue is very 
important for us and we have placed it at the very top of the 
agenda. We have said: Let us solve the important issues -- the 
cantons, the fair allocation of government posts, roads, 
refugees. 
  As far as the presidency issue is concerned we are even 
prepared to make a concession. This means that we will not 
insist on a Bosniak president. This will probably surprise our 
public, but we think that the other four issues are much more 
important. If the Croats are flexible over this we will be 
flexible over the fifth issue, all the more so because we have 
proposed a six-month mandate. According to the Constitution the 
mandate of the first president of the federation should last 
until the elections, which should be called within six months. 
However, if the elections were not held within six months there 
would be a rotating presidency. 
  [Saracevic] In your view, can we expect any progress in 
Vienna? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that we can, although I was told a 
little while ago that difficulties still remained and that the 
Croats were in a hurry and wanted to finish the talks this 
evening. To tell you the truth, judging by the situation last 
night -- I have been in contact two or three times a day either 
with Ganic or with Silajdzic -- well, it cannot all be solved 
today. However, the Croats have indicated that they only have 
today to talk because of some other obligations tomorrow and 
that all should be finalized this evening. Whether this pressure 
of time will in some way help to make a breakthrough in the 
current stalemate over some of the issues, we will see. 
Probably as early as this evening we will know how things 
stand. My view is that they will probably extend the talks 
until late this evening and will finish this evening. I am an 
optimist, [word indistinct] problems must be resolved. Our view 
is that the Washington agreement must be implemented. I told 
our delegation that if they needed to talk for another three, 
four, or even five days -- we must be prepared to oblige to put 
all the problems behind us. However, the Croats do not seem to 
be prepared to extend the talks for another two or three days. 
  [Saracevic] Will the proposals for appointments in the 
future 
federation be settled in Vienna? 
  [Izetbegovic] If you mean names, I do not think that that 
should be tackled [in Vienna]. That is something that calls for 
consultations with all political parties and relevant assembly 
[parliamentary] commissions, to weigh everything. It was my 
view, at least it was my suggestion, that no names should be 
named in Vienna. 
  [Saracevic] Who are the main personalities (you are counting 
on) in the future federation? 
  [Izetbegovic] Well, these are first the three current vice 
presidents of the [Muslim] SDA [Party of Democratic Action]: 
Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicakcic. Then come the government 
ministers who have passed their political tests: For instance, 
that man Bukvic [deputy prime minister], Faruk Smailbegovic, 
Munever Imamovic, Dr. Kreso, let me not go on listing any more 
names, well, there is also Hadzihasanovic, and so forth -- there 
is, in other words, a number of ministers who had an effect in 
the preceding period. This was all about the government. As 
for the soldiers, I should mention the corps commanders and no 
one else. In the case of the corps commander, an injustice has 
been done, which should be undone: [Words indistinct] generals 
and brigadiers and [word indistinct] generals, while our corps 
commanders are not generals, some of them have the rank of 
brigadier, they have worked hard to carry out their tasks. They 
have not had it easy. When it comes to the soldiers and army 
personnel, I want to single out the corps commanders. 
  [Saracevic] You have been spending a great deal of time 
with soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Mr President, 
there has been a lot of talk recently about the fund for 
invalids of the war and the families of the Islamic martyrs 
[sehidi]. 
  [Izetbegovic] We shall form a state institution, which will 
probably be called the Ministry for War Veterans Affairs. It is 
high time that the question of soldiers was resolved in a 
systematic way. This issue has been completely neglected. We 
have been busy worrying about the war, worrying about things 
hanging over us, but unfortunately, cases of Islamic martyrs and 
their families, war invalids etc are also hanging over us. 
Although it cannot be said that they are not at all being cared 
for, there has been no systematic care. They cannot see any 
future prospects for themselves. The invalids do not know what 
will happen to them once the war is over. What will happen with 
the families of the Islamic martyrs when the war ends? 
  There is often no justice. Soldiers, fighters are the focus 
of attention now, but they will not be during peace. People 
fear that perhaps profiteers will come then. Perhaps you 
remember a story, a novel which says: In the time of war you 
have first soldiers, then sergeants, low ranking officers, 
officers, generals, admirals, speculators etc, and in the time 
of peace it is the other way around -- first speculators, 
profiteers, etc. and fighters come at the end. Fighters, of 
course, have well-justified fear of this. 
  So, this ministry is to be formed. I arrived at the idea, 
some two or three days ago, when Dr Velayati gave me a check for 
one $1 million. I asked him what it should be spent on. They 
said: This is up to you, you must see what is most urgent. It 
seems to me that the most urgent need is to provide for the 
invalids of war and the families of fighters. Then I thought a 
bit more about it, and concluded that perhaps we should set up a 
fund, independent of the government, which would become a 
permanent institution. This fund would, independently from the 
state, provide for these people. It would not be a bad idea if 
the two were linked, so that we also have a state institution, 
and permanent care provided, where citizens would also take 
part. It would provide for invalids financially and it would 
also initiate the adoption of appropriate regulations. We now 
want to pass a regulation which would state that in our 
diplomatic and consular missions abroad, invalids will have 
priority when applying for jobs. This means that healthy people 
would gradually be replaced, let them come back here and do 
something else. 
  This fund could take care of these issues -- what could be 
done for our people who suffered most. These people are the 
biggest victims, apart from those who lost their lives. They 
and the families of the dead. I have thought about setting up 
this fund. I would like to be the head of the fund. I would 
like to form a committee, consisting of prominent people -- 
[writer] Alija Isakovic and some other ones. This would be a 
public institution which would be accountable to the public and 
would raise funds. I would help the war invalids to overcome 
their problems, to get artificial limbs, to get treatment, to 
get employment. [words indistinct] 
  I am working on this and I would be happy to end my career 
as 
a man who cares and leave the burden to some younger people. 
That is a big burden for my age, and I would like to gradually 
pass it on to somebody younger. I would like to take care of 
these issues relating to the war invalids and the families of 
the Islamic martyrs. 
  [Saracevic] Let me ask you finally, do you expect to see 
President Tudjman in Sarajevo soon? 
  [Izetbegovic] I do not believe we will see each other soon. 
There was an initiative for me to visit Split. He allegedly has 
difficulties in coming to Sarajevo -- technical difficulties 
because UNPROFOR cannot guarantee his safety. Then he invited 
me to Split; I really would not mind this trip and talks in 
Split. However, as you can see, I have been left here in Bosnia 
to hold the fort because Silajdzic, Ganic, and many others are 
abroad. That is why I have to be in Sarajevo and I do not 
believe that we shall see each other soon. However, the 
invitation to Tudjman remains open and we expect his arrival. 
Well, I hope he will settle these problems with UNPROFOR. 
  [Saracevic] Thank you for this interview, Mr. President.

  [Text] As part of the Croat-Bosniak negotiations on 
implementing the Washington agreement, the two delegations have 
resumed talks about border controls in central Bosnia and 
Hercegovina. Bosnian Croat delegation head Kresimir Zubak said 
that there are problems surrounding the issue of the borders and 
that they could be resolved only as part of a package. The 
Muslim side has proposed that Herzegovina be divided into two 
cantons: one Croat and the other with power-sharing on a parity 
basis. On the other hand, the Croatian side insists on a single 
Herzegovina. 
  Muslim delegation head Haris Silajdzic said that he expects 
nothing from today's negotiations in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna.

Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, to talk about the upcoming quadripartite meeting in 
Geneva with Bosnia-Herzegovina as the main topic. The second in 
command in the U.S. Administration appealed to President 
Izetbegovic for flexibility to ensure the latest efforts by the 
international community to find a political solution to Bosnia 
are successful. We shall do our utmost to bring about peace 
that will guarantee our people all their rights, Izetbegovic 
told U.S. Vice President Al Gore during this evening's telephone

  [Text] According to a SRNA report, the 40th session of the 
assembly of the republic of Srpska opened in Brcko somewhat 
after 1800 today. As has been learned, in the first part of the 
session, which is being held behind closed doors, deputies are 
discussing the current issues of interior and foreign policy of 
the republic of Srpska. Although it was planned for 1600, the 
session of the club of deputies has not been held. 
  [Begin Darko Milosevic recording] During the afternoon, 
assembly commissions held their sessions. Afterward, the 
Serbian Democratic Party club of deputies opened the session 
that is still under way. 
  The attention of the large number of domestic and foreign 
journalists is attracted by the announced debate on the current 
problems of war and peace in this region. The item on the 
agenda described as the assessment and analysis of the 
political-security situation is the only one dealing with this 
issue because, in an extremely long agenda consisting of 68 
items, most attention is devoted, conditionally speaking, to 
peacetime topics. It is also hinted here that the president of 
the republic may acquaint the deputies with the name of the new 
prime minister designate of the republic of Srpska. 
  It is completely calm in Brcko today and the life is going 
on 
in the usual, normal way. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by B. Maric: "We Shall Defend What Is Ours"] </F>
  [Excerpt] It is not true that the Serbian republic army is 
amassing fresh forces and hardware on the Brcko front. 
  This was stated by General Novica Simic, commander of the 
east Bosnian corps, who stressed that the republic of Srpska 
army has the same forces in the region of Brcko that it had 
three months ago. With this, Simic denied claims -- particularly 
by the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- about the concentration 
of an extremely large number of Serbian troops and 
armored-mechanized units in this part of Posavina. Moreover, 
the commander of the east Bosnian corps has denied rumors that 
the republic of Srpska army was preparing an offensive on the 
strongholds of Alija Izetbegovic's troops south of Brcko. 
  A Muslim army attack on Serbian defense positions would not 
be anything new for us, because they have been trying for months 
to cut off the "corridor" and reach the Sava River. So far, we 
have successfully repelled all attacks of the Muslim forces on 
this front; we shall repel the future ones as well, if they 
occur -- General Novica Simic told reporters assembled in Brcko. 
  Circles close to the republic of Srpska army assess that the 
Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has not -- even after the arrival 
of UN Protection Force observers on the Brcko front -- given up 
its intention of attacking the joint forces of the 1st Krajina 
and east Bosnia corps on this front. If the Muslim political 
and military leadership truly feared an "offensive of the 
Bosnian Serb forces," the General Staff of the Supreme Command 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would not have forbidden Hazim 
Sadic, commander of the 2d Tuzla Corps, to sign a cease-fire 
agreement on the Brcko front with General Simic. 
<H5>  Losers' Threats </H5>
  If the Muslim side were interested in peace in this part of 
Posavina, it would not have positioned seven brigades and 
several independent subversion-terrorist units around Brcko! 
Altogether, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has concentrated over 
14,000 troops, a part of its armored-mechanized forces, and 
artillery weapons, including 152-mm Nora howitzers around Brcko. 
On the other hand, northwest of Brcko, in the region of Orasje, 
the Croatian Defense Council has six brigades, supported by a 
military police battalion of the regular Croatian Army. 
Croatian troops also have 30 tanks and armored personnel 
carriers that they received from the Croatian Army. Moreover, 
they have large caliber artillery weapons that were brought to 
the Sava River bank from the Republic of Croatia. In addition 
to Djuro Matuzovic, commander of the Orasje region, the Croatian 
Defense Council units are under the command of Zeljko Barisic 
from Korac near Brod, Iko Stanic from Derventa, and Tomo Bozic 
from Odjak. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Excerpts] Despite his promises given earlier, [Serb 
military commander] General Milovanovic did not allow the 
helicopter of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] this morning 
to fly over the territory of the so-called Serb republic and 
bring to Gorazde the five-member delegation of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. So the meeting planned for today 
between the Serb aggressor side and the government delegation -- 
which was supposed to take place in Gorazde under the auspices 
of UNPROFOR and the International Red Cross -- has been 
canceled. [passage omitted] 
  Gorazde is still without electricity -- for two years and 
six days now -- without water -- as two years ago the chetniks 
cut off the water system Cajnice-Gorazde -- and without 
communications -- this city has been completely besieged for two 
years and a month and a half now. Talks about solving these 
problems for the Gorazde people were meant to take place today 
at the meeting that the chetniks canceled. The exchange of 
prisoners was also supposed to be on the agenda, as was the 
exchange of bodies, the NATO ultimatum, and the UN Security 
Council resolution (913), which the chetniks simply ignore.

of heavy weapons and troops on the southern foothills of Mount 
Igman [south of Sarajevo]. According to the same source, the 
weapons and troops were transferred via Sarajevo airport from 
the Muslim-held part of the city. [passage omitted] According 
to the same source, the Muslims have transferred 5,000 soldiers 
from Sarajevo to Mount Igman and Bjelasnica and, together with 
the forces deployed in the area previously and forces brought in 
from Konjic and Pazaric, they now have around 10,000 troops in 
the area, deployed in seven brigades. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zvornik, May 10 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems on 
Tuesday violated the truce in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo 
introduced in February this year, by attacking the Serb suburb 
of Ilijas from small arms and mortars, the Bosnian Serb army 
said in a statement. The same source also reported Moslem 
sniper activity against the Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo, 
especially the suburbs of Nedzarici, Grbavica and Ilidza. 
Extensive Moslem engineering works are under way in the 
Sarajevo suburbs of Vojnicko Polje and Mojmilo and the area near 
the Jewish cemetery, the statement said. 
  Following a NATO ultimatum and guarantees from Moscow that 
Russian peacekeepers will be deployed along the Moslem-Serb 
demarcation line in Sarajevo, the Serbs in February withdrew 
from the exclusion zone and placed their heavy weapons under 
U.N. control. The Moslems have evidently not complied with the 
NATO demand. A U.N. officer told the AFP on Tuesday that 
Bosnian Moslems deployed six of their heavy weapons on the 
southern slopes of Mt Igman near Sarajevo, on the line of 
contact with the Serbs, along with about 1,000 troops. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources reported that the Moslems on 
Tuesday launched artillery attacks on Serb-controlled Han 
Pijesak, Vlasenica, Sekovici and Zvornik in the east of war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Serb reconnaissance teams have reported Moslem troop 
movements and concentrations towards the Serb towns of Sekovici 
and Zvornik.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 11 (AFP) -- A pregnant woman and 
two children were killed in mortar shelling of the Serb-held 
city of Brcko in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
spokesman Major Dacre Holloway said Wednesday [11 May]. The 
civilians were killed at 7:35 p.m. (1735 GMT) Tuesday in a 
mortar attack on the city center. Thirteen other civilians were 
injured by 120 mm mortars, he said. 
  The UN Protection Force did not officially attribute the 
attack, but an UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb said there were 
"very strong indications" that the shells were fired from 
Bosnian Moslem positions. He said the UN military observers in 
Brcko sited nine impact points where shells struck in downtown 
Brcko. UN forces fear the city, a critical passage point on a 
strategic corridor linking Serb-controlled zones in Croatia and 
eastern and western Bosnia to Serbia, is becoming the new 
flashpoint in the two-year-old Bosnian war. In Belgrade, a 
spokesman for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic gave a 
different death toll, saying four people, including at least one 
child and a pregnant woman, were killed. He blamed what he 
called Tuesday's "savage" shelling on Bosnian Moslems. [passage 
omitted] 
  In other developments, lawyers who visited 11 French aid 
workers held by Bosnian Serbs for more than a month criticized 
the "intolerable" psychological conditions of their detention 
and accused French officials here of not trying to resolve the 
matter. The lawyers, from the Brussels-based International 
Federation of Human rights Leagues, said the aid workers from 
the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) group had been left in 
tight quarters, which created tension, and since have been 
separted into two groups. 
  They are accused of smuggling arms for the Bosnian 
Government, which their organization denies. The lawyers 
blasted French officials in Sarajevo for "accepting that for a 
month these people were left without defense, without a lawyer 
and saw no one." French Ambassador here Henri Jacolin said he 
saw the group Tuesday night, conceding they were upset over a 
Serb decision to prolong their detention by a month but "coming 
out of it." 
  The workers have been held since 8 April at the Sarajevo 
suburb of Lukavica pending trial by Serbs, who say they could 
face up to 15 years in prison.

  [Text] [Announcer] Speaking from the Office of the Slovak 
Government Prime Minister, Jozef Moravcik has reacted to the 
article in today's edition of REPUBLIKA. Our correspondent 
Zuzana Stukovska conveyed what Moravcik said by telephone. 
  [Stukovska] I began this brief interview by reading the 
eight-point program for cooperation between the present 
government and the Hungarian coalition parties. 
  [Begin recording] [Moravcik] This is a very simple business. 
We have agreed on the principle that would govern our 
cooperation. We told each other what things we could tackle from 
among the problems concerning national minorities. We expressed 
all of this in the government's policy statement. This means 
the content of our agreement has been reflected in the 
government policy statement. Apart from the government's policy 
statement there is nothing else that would bind us as far as 
this business is concerned. 
  [Stukovska] Could one therefore say that the Hungarian 
coalition has always been a certain factor that could tip the 
scales and could it be said that this is also the case at 
present? A question thus arises whether some of the information 
published in REPUBLIKA is based on truth. One of the points of 
the agreement says, for example, and I quote -- it is necessary 
to halt the establishment of the so-called bilingual alternative 
schools on the territory inhabited by Hungarians. Another point 
says -- it envisaged that departments for minorities, 
specifically for the Hungarian minority, will be established at 
the ministries of education and culture. Minorities will be 
able to develop their activities within these departments. 
  [Moravcik] Certain small organizational changes have been 
made, but this is on the whole in keeping with what we want to 
do in the field of education and culture and here I see no 
problem. This has involved a small organizational change 
designed to facilitate the work of both ministries. To impart 
other dimension to it would therefore appear to me to be very 
strange, almost ludicrous, I would say. 
  [Stukovska] What do you think of the fact that the article 
has appeared precisely at this time? 
  [Moravcik] I do not attach a great deal of importance to 
what 
is published in the daily REPUBLIKA. I am used to seeing 
published in this daily heaps of insults, unsubstantiated 
reports, and various claims which are far from the truth. 
  [Stukovska] Moreover, in this instance too, the article has 
been reprinted from the Hungarian press and specifically from 
NEPSZABADSAG. 
  [Moravcik] Regarding the specifics of the article, I have 
explained to you that at present there does not exist anything 
apart from the government policy statement, which forms the 
basic platform also for our relations with Hungarian political 
parties, that would be binding for us. 
  [Stukovska] Have there been on the part of representatives 
of 
the Hungarian parties any demands for something different, that 
would go beyond the government's policy statement? 
  [Moravcik] This applies in general. We have agreed we shall 
exert a maximum possible effort in order to implement what has 
been expressed in the policy statement. This will suffice for 
the current period. There has been enough of this. 
  [Stukovska] Does this mean there have been no demands on the 
part of Hungarian parties? 
  [Moravcik] No, no such demands have been presented and we do 
not expect them. [end recording]

  [Text] No secret agreement exists between the current 
government coalition and ethnic Hungarian political groups, nor 
any other document overstepping the framework of the government 
policy statement which was endorsed by parliament, said Lubomir 
Lintner, director of the government's Press and Information 
Office, in an interview with a TA SR correspondent today. 
  Lintner was reacting to the statement of former Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar in the "Kroky" television program on 
Sunday in which Meciar said that the current government is a 
vassal of the Hungarian political parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Maria </F>
Hluchanova and Jana Pankovcinova in Bratislava on 3 May: 
"Screening Certificates of Government Members Will Be at Hand in 
a Few Weeks"] 
  [Text] Asked whether the government's situation is not 
complicated by rumors that one member of the cabinet has 
problems with the screening law, Prime Minister Moravcik said in 
an interview for Monday's [2 May] NARODNA OBRODA: "As required 
by the screening law, I asked for all government members to be 
screened in order to ascertain whether they meet the conditions 
of that law. I am waiting for an answer." After yesterday's 
meeting of the government, we asked the prime minister in this 
context: 
  [SME] When did you ask for the screening of government 
members and why had they not been screened during the formation 
of the coalition cabinet? 
  [Moravcik] It takes some time. You know how much time we had 
to form the government. The screening certificates could not be 
obtained prior to the government's formation because, under the 
law, the certificate must be delivered to the screened person 
first and only when the screened person deems it suitable can it 
submit the certificate to whoever requested the screening. In 
other words, it was not technically possible to do this earlier. 
I expect that we will have all the screening certificates at 
hand in a few weeks. 
  [SME] Are the rumors that one member of your cabinet has 
problems with the screening certificate true? 
  [Moravcik] I do not know whether they are true. That is 
just what the screening should show. 
  [SME] Should any member of your cabinet receive a positive 
screening certificate, how will you deal with the situation? 
  [Moravcik] We will proceed in accordance with the law. 
  [SME] When exactly did you ask for the ministers' screening 
certificates? 
  [Moravcik] Some two or three weeks after the government's 
appointment. 
  [SME] How are we supposed to understand your words that the 
results of screenings will be available in only a few weeks? 
When Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic, asked the Slovak Information Service [SIS] 
for a screening certificate, he received it on the second or 
third day after submitting the application, as he told SME in an 
interview. Why should it take a few weeks? 
  [Moravcik] I do not know how the process is progressing 
technically in the SIS. But I know that they have problems with 
the files. 
  [SME] How quickly do you intend to amend the screening law? 
  [Moravcik] It has not yet been decided whether the 
government will propose an amendment to the screening law. 
  [SME] Do you not think that the questioning of this law 
undermines your declared endeavor to respect and comply with the 
screening law? 
  [Moravcik] We are proceeding in accordance with the law.

<F P=106> ["Declaration on the Dismissal of Four Members of the Slovak </F>
Television Council" issued by the former and current members of 
the Council in Bratislava on 5 May] 
  [Text] We, the former and current members of the Slovak 
Television [STV] Council, declare the following: All the 
accusations against our Council have been fabricated. Our 
Council, by its actions, has demonstrated frequently its 
impartiality and has provided all the major political entities 
with equitable and clear-cut guarantees for their appearances on 
television. The Council, despite the amateurish conditions 
arising from the flawed law on STV, had begun to function 
successfully in dealing with the chain of chronic problems 
affecting Slovak Television. By its verdict of no confidence in 
four of our members -- that is, by breaking up the Council -- 
the parliamentary coalition majority has forcibly interfered 
with the process of introducing order into STV and has thus 
accepted full responsibility for all the consequences arising 
from this. 
  At the same time, the decision about the Council was made 
undemocratically without dialogue, for which we had appealed 
repeatedly, and without the opportunity to defend ourselves, 
which we consider to be a mockery of the fundamental principles 
of democracy and of normal human decency. We will submit -- via 
the appropriate channels -- the text casting doubt on STV's 
Statutes to the Slovak Constitutional Court for its 
consideration and we will inform the Council of Europe of the 
unprecedented decision by the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic [NR SR] in order to bring its attention to the gross 
disregard for the principles enshrined in its recommendations 
Nos. 429/70 and 1147/91. We state that the main reason for the 
dismissal of four of our members was a preelection, 
party-politically motivated attempt to gain crucial influence in 
television and also to assert the economic interests of certain 
groups that are benefiting financially from agreements 
disadvantageous to Slovak Television. We consider the dismissal 
of four of our members to be an act of political despotism and 
to be an attack against the freedom of speech and the 
independence of Slovak Television. We appeal to the 
journalistic community to respond appropriately to this act. We 
reject all forms of pressure -- unfortunately well-known from 
the break up of STV's preceding councils -- pressure oriented 
toward wearing down and intimidating the members of the councils 
with the aim of forcing them to resign. 
  Signed: Jozef Darmo; Eva Kristinova; Milan Ozvald; Jergus 
Ferko; Dusan Jariabek; and Miroslav Kollar. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  I identify wholly with my dismissed colleagues from the STV 
Council and I reject the smears that have been cast against our 
work to date. I consider the method of dismissing my colleagues 
"twice" to be a purely expedient and dishonorable act. 
  Signed: Dusan Jariabek. 
<H5>  A Letter From Eva Kristinova </H5>
  "I was outraged by the expression of no confidence in four 
members of our STV Council. We took up our honorable, unpaid 
posts with full responsibility and, as nonpartisan Council 
members, we conscientiously and courageously defended the 
interests of our Slovak television viewers," says STV Council 
member Eva Kristinova in the letter she addressed yesterday to 
NR SR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. In her letter of resignation, 
she asks NR SR deputies to bear in mind that she does not 
consider herself to be less honorable and courageous than her 
four dismissed colleagues; therefore, she stands with them. 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 6 May on page 1, 
under the headline "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia's 
Intraparty Slanging Match," carries a 600-word "(jo)"-signed 
report on the parliament session convened to discuss the 
proposal of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. 
The report also reveals that a secret ballot was held to elect 
six new members to the STV Council. According to the report, 
they are "J. Prusak (nominated by the Union of Slovak Television 
Producers); P. Kollar (Coexistence Movement); T. Salayova 
(Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement); K. Bezak (Christian 
Democratic Movement); K. Foldvari (Democratic Union of 
Slovakia); and S. Benicka (Party of the Democratic Left)."]

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Call To Prevent the Liquidation of Slovak </F>
Radio"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- The Slovak Syndicate of Journalists 
and the primary organization of the Trade Union of Mass Media 
Employees at Slovak Radio have issued a statement on the present 
situation at Slovak Radio. It states that shortcomings in 
legislation pertaining to Slovak Radio, particularly the lack of 
clarity regarding its financing and economic management; 
relations with the state and the term "public corporation"; 
violations of the Law on the State Budget; the suspension of 
financing of Slovak Radio in 1993; as well as internal problems 
are driving Slovak Radio toward collapse in terms of economy, 
personnel, and programming. Despite the limitation of Slovak 
Radio broadcasts from three to two stations, the institution is 
short of 8 million korunas a month to meet the obligations that 
Law No. 255 of 1991 imposes on Slovak Radio. Owing to economic 
pressures, Slovak Radio abolished in 1993 125 permanent 
editorial posts and other creative workers. The other employees 
are working with feelings of hopelessness and apathy because 
their pay for the work that they do is inadequate. 
  "As these problems are so bad as to be a threat to media 
freedom in Slovak Radio, we are asking the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Slovak Republic to 
take effective measures to establish the conditions for calm, 
good, and competent work for the benefit of the listener."

<F P=106> [Report by Karol Bohunicky: "An As-Good-as-New Screening </F>
Problem -- Candidates for Secret Collaboration"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava -- Yesterday's news briefing at the 
Slovak Interior Ministry was devoted to tax evasion, abuse of 
the clearing account, and screenings. 
  Almost three-quarters of the crimes committed in Slovakia 
are 
of an economic nature. Representatives from the Financial 
Police estimate tax evasion during the first three months of 
this year to amount to nearly 3.5 billion korunas [Sk]. 
Criminal proceedings are already underway in cases involving 
losses of about Sk1.0 billion. In scams involving the import of 
oil products during the first quarter alone, certain importers 
defrauded the state of some Sk300-400 million in taxes. The 
Financial Police have reason to suspect that an extensive 
network of fraudsters with contacts abroad is operating here. 
  The activity of the Financial Police in machinations in the 
so-called old account between the Slovak and Czech Republics is, 
at the moment, more of an investigative and informative nature. 
It is apparent from the investigation, however, that "in scams 
associated with the old account between the Slovak and Czech 
Republics during the first three months of the year alone, 
evasion amounting to Sk1.0 billion is estimated." However, it 
is still not clear whether such an abuse of the account is 
really a crime or merely an abuse of what the law does not 
prohibit. 
  Minister Pittner said, in connection with screenings, that 
they will be carried out by the Slovak Information Service, 
because this task falls to it by law. Unfortunately, that part 
of the "screening law" concerning the candidates for secret 
collaboration, which the Constitutional Court of the former 
Federation suggested be removed from the law, has not been 
amended. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime </F>
ministerial candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats; place 
and date not given: "There Is No Sense in Talking About A 
Liberal-Dominated Coalition"] 
  [Text] We are now drawing the voters' attention to the 
fact that only votes for the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
can prevent an absolute majority for the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] -- Gabor Kuncze told us. Kuncze told us that the 
SZDSZ did not give up the idea of becoming a governing party 
after the elections. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Will the SZDSZ election strategy change in 
view of the fact that the three parties participating in the 
liberal cooperation fared far worse than expected in the first 
round of the elections? 
  [Kuncze] We want to continue to conduct a positive campaign 
in which we would like to win over as many voters as possible 
for our program. At the same time, it is no longer sense to 
talk about the emergence of a liberal-dominated coalition after 
the elections, because the results of the other parties that 
signed a cooperation agreement with us do not make such a 
coalition possible. In any case, the aforementioned agreement 
continues to be valid. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In addition to replacing the current 
government, the SZDSZ also aimed at creating a liberal-dominated 
coalition. After failing to achieve this, what is the major 
goal of the SZDSZ? 
  [Kuncze] We are now drawing the voters' attention to the 
fact that only votes for the SZDSZ can prevent an absolute 
majority for the MSZP. For this, we highlight the differences 
between the election programs of the SZDSZ and the MSZP. We 
call upon the voters to give us the authority to represent our 
program adequately in the coming period. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It is hardly possible to efficiently 
represent a program from the opposition. Therefore, what you 
have just said means that the SZDSZ wants to participate in the 
next coalition. 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ has not given up the idea of becoming a 
governing party if it can adequately represent itself in 
Parliament after the elections. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What if the MSZP gets an absolute majority? 
  [Kuncze] This would harm the chances of a coalition between 
the two parties. Our previous position on the possibilities and 
conditions of a coalition is unchanged. The SZDSZ will 
participate in a coalition if it can represent itself with an 
adequate weight. I would stress once more: We ask the voters to 
give us a mandate for this. All the questions about the future 
coalition can only be answered after 29 May, when we know the 
results of the second round. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you agree with the conclusion that the 
"national cooperation" declared by the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] to contain the further advance of the MSZP will harm 
the election chances of the SZDSZ? 
  [Kuncze] On the one hand, such a cooperation does not add to 
the chances of the conservative bloc. On the other hand, such 
an attitude on the part of the right-wing parties could 
facilitate an absolute majority for the MSZP. The MDF has 
already contributed greatly to the success of the MSZP, and we 
think it would be unfortunate if the MDF continued this mistaken 
policy between the two election rounds.

<F P=106> ["Sz.P."-signed interview with Zoltan Gal, head of the </F>
parliamentary group of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP; 
place and date not given: "No Changes Are Expected in the MSZP 
Style"] 
  [Text] The parties that based their programs on replacing 
the current coalition have the moral obligation to accept the 
burden of government -- Zoltan Gal, head of the parliamentary 
group of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told us, and he 
also thought that there would not be a minority government. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] On the basis of the results of the first 
round of elections, do you see any chance of the MSZP obtaining 
more than half of the mandates? Would you accept governing 
alone? 
  [Gal] I only see principled and mathematical chances for 
obtaining an absolute majority. In that case, we would probably 
not find coalition partners, because the parties would choose 
the easier solution of opposition. At the same time, we would 
still seek a partner in that situation too, because the tasks 
faced by Hungary require broad social support. I am confident 
that there will be responsible political forces in this country. 
The parties that based their programs on replacing the current 
coalition have the moral and political obligation to accept the 
burdens of government. In addition, the possible party policy 
maneuvers should be explained to the voters. The socialists 
would also accept the government task alone, because we would be 
able to solve the tasks along with an adequate opposition 
attitude. I am convinced that there will be no minority 
government here. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It was said on the election night that, in 
addition to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], you are 
again considering the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] 
too.... 
  [Gal] The MSZP said constantly that there are several 
meeting points between these two parties on the level of program 
coordination. The subjective condition of the MSZP-Fidesz 
cooperation has become extremely difficult in the wake of the 
change in the Fidesz attitude. If a correction takes place in 
the Fidesz, with all its consequences, a new situation might 
emerge between the two parties. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you take into account the possibility 
that Hungarian society will be slightly surprised at the 
superiority of the MSZP and a balance will take place in the 
second round of elections? 
  [Gal] In principle, I do not completely exclude the 
possibility of such considerations in the broad strata of 
voters. The MSZP continues to conduct its campaign correctly, 
and no change in our style is expected. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you see any danger to yourselves deriving 
from the considerable advance of the MSZP? 
  [Gal] A party that won such a high percentage of votes must 
think its past and future over thoroughly. Self-restraint is a 
desirable attitude, both within the party and toward society. 
There can be no revenge or purge of any kind. Obviously, the 
party will be threatened by the careerists appearing in the wake 
of its success, but this must be avoided with internal 
democracy. From a certain point of view, the MSZP is dividing 
society, and those who voted against us did this deliberately. 
The party has only one argument to convince these people, 
namely the coming four years.

  [Excerpts] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is asking 
those who do not wish for a potential MSZP [Hungarian Socialist 
Party]-SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] coalition to support 
the MDF candidates. According to the statement by the MDF 
National Executive, the MSZP-SZDSZ coalition could gain a 
two-thirds majority, which would mean power on a scale which is 
undesireably excessive in a democracy. [passage omitted] 
  The MDF cannot conceive of cooperation with the SZDSZ, even 
on a local level. MDF Executive Chairman Sandor Lezsak also 
said that in the election campaign it would be incorrect to warn 
against a left-wing danger because that is already a fact.

  [Excerpts] The four liberal parties [the Alliance of Free 
Democrats, SZDSZ; the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz; the 
Agrarian Alliance; and the Entrepreneurs Party] have concluded a 
concrete agreement on the question of where and who is to step 
back in favor of another party's candidate in cases where the 
difference between the number of votes for the parties' 
candidates is at least 4 percent. Judit Laszlo reports. 
  [Laszlo] There are SZDSZ and Fidesz politicians among the 
first three candidates in 11 individual parliamentary 
constituencies. According to the liberal cooperation agreement 
signed before the first round of the elections, the following 
decision was taken at the talks today. SZDSZ campaign chief 
Balint Magyar briefed the press about it. 
  [Begin Magyar recording] There were five constituencies 
where 
candidates stepped back automatically in favor of another 
liberal candidate. In four cases it happened in favor of an 
SZDSZ candidate and in one case in favor of a Fidesz candidate. 
There were six constituencies where the difference between the 
votes cast for the SZDSZ and Fidesz was less than 4 percent, but 
SZDSZ candidates were ahead of the others there. The Fidesz has 
expressed its intention to appeal to its candidates there to 
step back, so that SZDSZ candidates can compete as the only 
liberal candidates. We have also offered in one constituency 
that the SZDSZ candidate, Andras Szelier, who won the second 
largest number of votes, would step back in favor of [Fidesz 
Chairman] Viktor Orban in Szekesfehervar, but the Fidesz has 
explicitly asked the SZDSZ candidate to continue to compete. 
[end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Laszlo] The liberal agreement concerns the Agrarian 
Alliance 
only in one case. The party's parliamentary candidate will step 
back in favor of a better performing SZDSZ candidate in Edeleny 
of county Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen, campaign chief Lajos Buzasi 
said. Tamas Nagy, chairman of the Agrarian Alliance, who is 
still in competition, will be supported by the liberal parties 
in the second round as well. The same applies to Peter Zwack, 
chairman of the Entrepreneurs Party, who was a joint candidate 
of the four liberal parties even in the first round.

<F P=106> [Article by Endre Csurka, chairman of the Pest county </F>
organization of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party: "The 
Fruits of the Pact Have Matured"] 
  [Text] The first round of the elections made it clear that 
the pact between the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] broke the national forces. 
It also became clear why it was so important for the late 
Jozsef Antall to destroy the Smallholders Party and to separate 
the national wing from the core of the MDF. National radicalism 
and national thought suffered a serious defeat because the broad 
strata of the society voted in favor of the "gulyas communism." 
Istvan Csurka already saw it in 1992, something that the MDF 
was still unable to see, namely that Antall's policy aims at 
breaking the national right wing. 
  The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is expected to have 
such 
a big number of mandates in the new parliament that it will also 
be able to legislate the two-thirds majority laws alone and it 
will not need the SZDSZ as the advanced bastion. If they accept 
the SZDSZ in the government, they will only do so in order to 
maintain the appearance of a coalition. They will allow a few 
liberal victories in some places in individual election 
districts, but a national party will only be able to make it 
into Parliament from list elections. The national parties 
together will not reach the number of votes given to the MSZP. 
  The law on former policemen [active during the repression 
following the uprising of 1956] came too late, and so did the 
uncovering of some irregularities by the television; these 
things could no longer influence the public mood. Power over 
the press should have been instituted long before the elections, 
in 1990, and the press has now proved what kind of destruction 
it is capable of carrying out. With constant pessimistic 
anti-national manifestations and in the spirit of Aczel's 
continuity, the press succeeded in contaminating the people's 
mood with the idea that today it is much worse than it used to 
be in the old regime, and there is a lot of truth in this. 
However, in this country, people who are living better are also 
complaining. 
  The MSZP-government will try to avoid street demonstrations 
and, therefore, it will consume and distribute the hard currency 
reserves and will temporarily restore the sham-prosperity of the 
"gulyas- communism" by carrying out a pseudo improvement in the 
standard of living, and when it finally destroyed the Hungarian 
national wing and consolidated its power, the MSZP could also 
give the impression of democratic elections. 
  Hungary is becoming similar to the South-American countries, 
and the nomenclature-careerists have taken over the entire 
economy, they are the big capitalists, they control the press, 
and now they have also obtained political power. It will be 
easy for them to put up a show of democratic elections every 
four years, because they control everything, including the 
banks, the army, and the police. A few economic trials 
disguised as criminal trials will come now, with the toughest 
and most radical opposition members as victims. We can expect 
the leadership of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] to 
be among the first victims, but many more people will celebrate 
the MSZP power in prison. 
  Aware of the results, it is clear that the government has 
three weeks more to turn something in its favor, and if they 
fail to do this, the national forces will be left with a single 
choice in this country, namely the street. Aware of the events, 
there is only one way of halting the victory of the MSZP, namely 
if the second round of elections is unsuccessful for them 
everywhere. Therefore, I call upon the national forces and 
parties, including the MDF, the Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP], and the Smallholders Party, to boycott the votes 
and make a second round impossible. Only people who want the 
return of the old regime should go to vote in the second round.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Peter Csermely: "Both Fewer and Broken"] </F>
  [Text] At the time of writing, we still have no final data 
on the exact election results. Therefore, what I am writing now 
is only valid if the quick summaries presented to us on Sunday 
evening at least slightly reflect the future official results. 
Thus, let us stay in the realm of supposition -- namely that the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has achieved a landslide 
victory. 
  Starting from this premise, and also avoiding any special 
pathetic formulation, let me say quite dryly that we cannot find 
an independently chosen step backward of similar proportions in 
Hungarian history. By electing the MSZP, the Hungarian 
population has proven that they do not deserve freedom. They do 
not know what to do with it; or if they do, this is the result. 
The coalition has not brought a Canaan to Hungary in four years 
and, therefore, it fell due to something that it often mentioned 
as inevitable -- namely that the first steps of restructuring 
will be a burden to everyone. Our society did not understand 
that dealing with the debt inherited from those who are now 
delighted in mischief was not an empty slogan, that it is 
impossible to extricate the country in one or two years from 40 
years of mud, and that the long debates in Parliament, which 
everyone was fed up with in the end, are natural things in a 
democracy and not something that proves the inadequacy of the 
legislators. No: Hungary's citizens turned away from genuine 
politics and gave up the luxury of thinking, and they voted in a 
way in which it appeared to them in some of their sober moments, 
namely that things were better then. The MSZP deserves to 
celebrate. Their deputies not only return but are brought back 
on the shoulders of the dissatisfied masses. We do not need 
Europe, and we spit on 1956; if one is a former policeman, so be 
it. Hungary voluntarily returned to the feet of its former 
masters. 
  This gesture shows an immeasurable moral distortion: From 
its own will, our society absolved the socialists from their 
moral burden of destroying this country. There are responsible 
people and victims of this act. And there are people who are 
both responsible and victims: the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF]. The MDF is a victim because it was unable to get closer 
to the society in four years; it is also a victim because the 
dream of Western European integration and NATO membership proved 
to be at an unattainable distance; the MDF is a victim because 
the coalition engaged in politics on a moral basis and failed; 
it is a victim because it counted on the people's common sense 
and, disregarding the mass media, it tried to influence the 
people in a weak election campaign. I do not want to write all 
this in detail again, although I should do so because the MDF is 
also responsible for all of this. 
  The overwhelming majority of deputies in Hungary's second 
freely elected Parliament will be communists. One does not yet 
know much about the strategy of the old-new masters, but one can 
presume that they will maintain the playful formalities of 
democracy. For example, there will be other parties there: an 
MDF that will succumb to the defeat and rapidly disintegrate 
from within; the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], a party 
forced to continue on a wild goose chase for another four years, 
at least; the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a 
party unable to break out of mediocrity; the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP], a party that so often used the 
anti-communist rhetoric, with which it discredited both this 
rhetoric and itself; and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], 
a party that, well, always falls on its feet. There will also 
be a free press: It will not be able to cause half as much 
damage as it has already caused. In view of the statements made 
in the last four years, there will be no unemployment, price 
increases, strikes, inflation, privatization, national 
minorities living beyond our borders; and the Hungarian soccer 
will flourish again. This is only natural; this is why we 
reelected them. 
  Three out of the four Visegrad countries have collapsed. The 
Czech Republic no longer has an opponent in the race to catch up 
with Europe. It is true that capital -- or, using the old-new 
terminology, the robbing imperialist capital -- will continue to 
trickle for a while, then it will stop. We will then take up 
loans -- some 22 billion, for example. And before the House 
collapses on our heads, we will again hand over the government 
helm and the bills to others; there will always be honest and 
romantic people. Then we will again be able to relax for four 
years while they play democracy. What problems could we have? 
  In its often-mentioned former electoral slogan, the MDF 
promised a thorough cleanup. This has failed to materialize 
ever since. We will get it now for sure.

<F P=106> [Correspondents report: "Duray, Marko, Vekas Express Views </F>
on the First Round of Elections in Hungary"] 
  [Text] The leader of the Coexistence Movement in Slovakia, 
a party that is close to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 
among the political parties in Hungary, told MAGYAR HIRLAP 
yesterday that the victory of the Socialists in Hungary could 
lead to cooler relations between the ethnic Hungarians beyond 
the borders and the government in Budapest. 
  Miklos Duray pointed out that "whether we like it or not, 
the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is the successor party of 
Kadar's Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]." Miklos 
Duray thinks that the reason behind the big success of the MSZP 
is that some of the voters find the change in the regime too 
difficult. In his view, "the MSZP slogans on professional 
governing are not convincing, because the MSZP cannot make 
wonders either if it wants to continue the market economy, the 
change in the regime, and catching up with the West." 
  Regarding the relations between the ethnic Hungarians beyond 
our borders and Budapest, Duray draws a line between the MSZP 
and the other five parties that have made it into Parliament. 
He reminds the readers that it was the MSZP alone that 
categorically criticized the late prime minister Jozsef Antall's 
declaration at the time, namely that he felt like the prime 
minister of 15 million Hungarians in spirit, and it was only the 
MSZP that categorically placed the issue of signing a basic 
treaty with our neighbors on the agenda as a first point, 
leaving the issue of settling the situation of ethnic Hungarians 
abroad as a second point. 
  Well before the elections, Duray told us that the relations 
between the ethnic Hungarians living abroad and Budapest will 
cool down if the MSZP gets into power. He repeated this opinion 
in his telephone interview on 9 May: "If the MSZP continues to 
follow this position, the relations will definitely become 
cooler, similarly to the Kadar period" -- said Duray. However, 
Duray did not think that the MSZP would form a government alone 
and so, "the coalition partner can also have a say in this 
matter." 
  The Slovak partner of the MSZP, the Party of the Democratic 
Left, has not yet taken upon itself to evaluate the elections. 
However, party chairman Peter Weiss does not find the presence 
of trade union leaders in Parliament a dangerous phenomenon. 
  In its position, the Hungarian Civic Party points out the 
following: It became clear that the people want basic changes; 
they are more interested in the future, rather than the constant 
threat of past sins. The victory of the MSZP does not mean a 
radical change in Hungary's domestic and foreign policy; 
perhaps, this policy will only be more transparent, 
professional, and confident. A calm and balanced social-liberal 
government can also create the conditions for settling Hungary's 
relations with its neighbors; consequently, Hungary could also 
deal with the problem of ethnic Hungarians living abroad from 
the position of tangible results -- the position states. 
  Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, the head of the parliamentary group 
Coexistence, told MAGYAR HIRLAP that the contacts of his 
movement with the new government will obviously not be so good 
as with the MDF government, because their relations with the MDF 
were "more than just official contacts." 
  The principled position of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina 
Hungarians [VMDK] is that it refrains from judging the Hungarian 
parties from an ideological viewpoint and it sticks to its goal 
of building good contacts with the prevailing Hungarian 
government -- Janos Vekas, deputy chairman of the VMDK told 
MAGYAR HIRLAP. 
  Vekas told us that they have had correct relations with the 
MSZP so far and the fact that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn was the 
first to support the VMDK after the crisis that developed in the 
wake of the general meeting in Zenta meant a lot to the VMDK. 
"We participated in several conferences organized by the 
socialists, conferences dealing with the issue of national 
minority autonomy. We think the MSZP has been a correct partner 
so far" -- Vekas said. 
  "The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- 
UDMR 
in Romanian] and the ethnic Hungarians living in Romania are 
following the Hungarian elections with great interest; it is in 
our interest to have a politically stable Hungary with a strong 
economy to support us, a country that can and wants to support 
the ideas of the Hungarians living abroad and the concepts of 
their legitimate organizations" -- RMDSZ chairman Bela Marko 
told MAGYAR HIRLAP. He stressed, however, that he does not want 
to make predictions or evaluations between the two rounds of 
elections. 
  In Marko's view, we must start from the premise that every 
major political party in Hungary accepted the need to settle the 
situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad as a basic principle. 
This is a nationwide interest, one considered by any future 
government, and one that the Hungarian foreign policy will 
always have to represent. 
  "We know the programs of various parties and, based on this 
knowledge, we can say that care for the ethnic Hungarians living 
beyond Hungary's borders appears in every program. Naturally, 
there can be tactical differences. In our view, in the case of 
ethnic Hungarians living abroad, and especially in the case of 
Hungarians in Transylvania, we must start from the premise that 
it is first of all the task of the elected organization of these 
minorities to decide what solutions they find positive. 
Seeking, supporting, and implementing these solutions could 
basically contribute to an adequate settling of the problems 
prevailing between our countries" -- Bela Marko said.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Shpetim Roqi from Budapest] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] At the invitation of Romanian 
President Ion Iliescu, President Sali Berisha and the delegation 
accompanying him left today for an official and friendly visit 
to the Republic of Romania. At Rinas airport, Berisha was seen 
off by Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, deputies, 
representatives of political parties, etc. On his way to 
Romania, President Berisha stopped over in Budapest. For more, 
let us listen to a telephone report by our correspondent Shpetim 
Roqi: 
  [Roqi] President Berisha arrived at Budapest's Ferihegy 
Airport at 1400. From there the delegation headed toward the 
governmental residence in Andrassy. Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz welcomed Berisha there, and invited him for lunch. During 
the luncheon, they discussed possibilities for further 
development between our two countries, countries that are 
related not only through a past history, but that should be 
related by a future history as well. 
  President Berisha made an expose of the democratic reform in 
Albania and considered Albania to be a country that accepted the 
shock reform as a painful, but the only, reform to revive the 
country. 
  Hungarian President Arpad Goncz said that he was informed 
about the reform and was amazed by the achievements of this 
reform, which really surprises one when thinks about what 
unfavorable geo- political circumstances Albania is in at 
present. He wanted to know about the problems that worry 
Albania today, such as relations with southern neighbors, the 
problem of Kosova, and the Albanian question in general. 
  President Berisha considered Hungary to be an example for 
the 
peaceful way of passing into a new system. We will report more 
later.

date not given: "We Would Like To Receive Positive Feedback"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Scipiades] In a recent 
interview to MAGYAR HIRLAP, your Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik 
admitted that foreign policy is the only area in which the 
Slovak Government can show results until the elections scheduled 
for September this year; he also declared that he wants to send 
positive signals to the outside world, including Hungary. You 
will convey some of these signals. What signals can we expect 
in the near future? 
  [Mitrova] We will indeed try to convey such signals, and 
Hungary is among our priorities. The Slovak Government adopted 
the law on population registration a few days ago, a law that 
makes it possible for national minority women to register their 
names without the Slovak ending "ova." I hope the Slovak 
Parliament will also adopt the law soon and that this will end 
the debate on this issue. I regard this as a really positive 
signal. I hope the issue of village and town names will also be 
solved soon. 
  [Scipiades] What would you like to achieve as ambassador in 
Budapest? 
  [Mitrova] I would like to contribute to the easing of 
tension prevailing between the two countries, a tension that 
seems to have already decreased slightly. I see possibilities 
for such an easing of tension. I think the most important thing 
for me is to create confidence. I would like very much to also 
receive positive signals from Hungary to our positive signals 
because this is very important for us to be able to come up with 
further positive steps. [passage omitted] 
  [Scipiades] In your opinion, what effect could the Hungarian 
elections have on the Slovak election campaign or the elections 
themselves? 
  [Mitrova] I very much hope that the Hungarian elections will 
only have positive effects. On both banks of the Danube, we 
came to the conclusion that there is no other solution but to 
seek and find a way adequate to both sides; otherwise, both 
sides will also hurt themselves. [passage omitted] 
  [Scipiades] Do you see any possibility of opening consulates 
and some further border crossing points? 
  [Mitrova] There are no serious obstacles whatsoever in 
gradually implementing these things. I cannot yet give you a 
concrete time, but these are natural things. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by </F>
unidentified correspondent of the French magazine LE POINT; 
place and date not given: "It Is All the Same to Me Who Is Going 
To Govern and What Party Will Be Included in the Government"] 
  [Text] [LE POINT] For quite a while one could notice a 
legal reticence to apply to Romania a Western model of market 
economy. Are you still reticent about it? 
  [Iliescu] These are all fabrications. I am not a 
simple-minded person. I am not an uneducated person. (...) 
  These are fabrications that are exploited for political 
reasons and can be explained through the internal political 
struggle, in which such comments are also made: "Iliescu 
belonged to the nomenclature in the 1960's." However, nobody is 
talking about the fact that Romania's political opening took 
place in the 1960's. Romania was the first and only country that 
succeeded in achieving the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1958. 
After that, in the 1960's, a general openness followed with 
Romania's firm opposition to Soviet tendencies to achieve the 
integration of economies of satellite countries and to submit 
them to the Soviet economy. Then came Romania's opposition to 
the intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968. (...) Between 1960 
and 1967 I was among those who urged this openness of Romania. 
(...) 
  I have already mentioned that we have three major 
adversaries 
in the exercise of social life. I am talking about those who 
nurture nostalgic feelings for the recent past. This nostalgia 
has a reason, namely, there is a certain degree of 
dissatisfaction because the social explosion of December 1989 
took place precisely as a result of the difficulties of people's 
daily life, and conditions have still not improved. On the 
contrary: Industrial production has dropped, the international 
situation has not been favorable for our economy, and that is 
how inflation and unemployment emerged, which are phenomena that 
create new problems for people. There is a certain degree of 
dissatisfaction. All people hailed democracy, however, 
democracy without the improvement of people's living conditions 
has no value whatsoever for ordinary people. From this 
viewpoint, there are people who ask why, why indeed should we 
not recreate the old system that ensured a minimum of security 
for us? I say that this is no longer possible, even if there 
were people who wished to recreate the old structures, 
mechanisms, and institutions. (...) There is another type of 
nostalgia: the nostalgia of old people who remember the years 
before the war and who want to recreate the old structures of 
Romania that existed before the two world wars. This is even 
less possible (...). 
  The third group of "adversaries" are those who are in a 
hurry 
to get rich. There is much confusion in social and economic 
life in this period of changes and transition, because the 
authority of state institutions and the authority of the law are 
not yet solid and there are many shortfalls from this viewpoint. 
Thus, one can see various forms of corruption emerging, such as 
a tendency to avoid taxes, and one can also see people who want 
to get rich very quickly and people who want to get hold of 
power and wealth very quickly. This is a phenomenon to which we 
have to pay greatly increased attention. The society has to 
find forms of self-defense against such pressure. These are 
major problems. As far as I am concerned, I am not connected at 
all to the nostalgic people, however, I realize the difficulty 
of the process itself. I am a realistic person. I believe that 
in the current political situation we must get rid of all 
ideological prejudice and take into consideration the new 
social, national, and international realities. 
  [LE POINT] What political formula do you regard as possible 
in Romania, especially if we consider the situation you have 
just mentioned? 
  [Iliescu] There are a number of concrete problems that have 
to be solved in this period in which the government is a 
minority government. We have not had the chance to form a 
government of national unity, as I said from the very beginning, 
or a certain coalition that would ensure a stable majority. I 
even suggested that a political pact should be concluded and it 
should follow certain generally accepted principles. I am 
referring to principles that are the basis for organizing any 
type of government. From this viewpoint, it is all the same to 
me who will govern. A certain alternation could even be healthy 
for the future political life, because there is a certain 
viewpoint when people are in the opposition -- and are 
constantly criticizing -- and there is another viewpoint when 
they assume responsibility and try to solve problems. (...) 
That is why I was very frank when I suggested a national unity 
government, however, there were forces that claimed that this is 
undemocratic. In this climate of general suspicion there are 
people who think: What are Iliescu's goals? He is a dangerous 
type, a former nomenclatura member, a skillful politician, he 
wants to cheat us! They even affirmed that my idea was an 
attempt to stifle the political opposition, but what kind of 
democracy can we have when there is no opposition in parliament? 
  This was the way that they were thinking. Then I said: If 
you do not agree with my idea, we must form a coalition. This 
was not possible either. The only chance was to form a minority 
government with the party that held the most seats in 
parliament, that is 34 percent of the seats. There are new 
discussions now. As you know, we started negotiations in 
December 1993. I tried to find a new platform for dialogue with 
all parties, in order to work out a basic platform, a sort of 
political pact, in which we could include all points of 
consensus. Obviously, there are differences in regarding 
political and economic life and economic reform in general. 
However, there are some points of general agreement. (...) I 
could even say that as far as the idea of economic reform is 
concerned, there is a big platform and there are common aspects. 
However, there are also differences. In this context, I 
proposed that we should find those points that will create a 
platform of basic understanding. Now, proceeding from this 
idea, it is all the same to me which government will take the 
initiative of implementing this platform or what parties will be 
included in the respective government. (...) 
  [LE POINT] Mr. President, several neighboring, former 
communist countries in the East today are loudly voicing their 
concerns about a new danger of Russian hegemony in Central and 
Eastern Europe. What do you think about it and what is your 
stand on this issue? Do you also feel a certain apprehension? 
  [Iliescu] There are obviously some dangers. I believe that 
the Russian problem will stay topical for quite a while as one 
of the most difficult problems for Europe and for the world 
balance. Considering that Russia is still a big country, it will 
stay a major power, a country with many economic resources, and 
a country with a serious military potential. On the one hand, 
there are all these actions to ensure internal balance and 
economic stability and to strengthen democratic processes and 
democratic forces and, on the other hand, there are the actions 
to establish a free and efficient market economy, which is a 
much more complicated process for Russia than for other 
countries. (...) Thus, it is more difficult there to find 
solutions for internal economic, social, and political stability 
and to strengthen political forces. In these conditions of 
crisis, there is always the danger of the emergence of extremist 
tendencies, such as those expressed by Zhirinovskiy and others. 
Likewise, there is a certain imperial nostalgia, just as in the 
case of all the other countries that played an important role at 
a certain time in history. (...) Therefore, from this point of 
view, these concerns are real, they exist indeed. However, we 
are neighboring countries and we are interested in promoting 
good relations. (...)

  [Text] There already exists a public admission of this 
cabinet's inability to act, and the quarrels in the 
parliamentary majority aggravate the situation even more. This 
was pointed out by Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National 
Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], at 
a news conference on 10 May following a meeting of the SDS 
National Coordinating Council. The SDS is not sure that the 
prime minister will really present his plan for personnel and 
structural changes in the cabinet at the 11 May National 
Assembly session, but it hopes that the parliamentary majority 
will express its opinion on the draft decision on the cabinet's 
policy submitted by the SDS deputies. 
  The SDS National Conference will be a closed forum. This 
also 
was decided today by the SDS National Coordinating Council.

  [Text] Tirana, May 7 (ATA) -- On May 7, afternoon, the 
president of the Republic, Sali Berisha, held a press conference 
for local and foreign reporters. 
  Asked about a statement of the spokesman of the Greek 
Government, Venizellos, that the relations between Greece and 
Albania have a tendency of a new tension, as well as about an 
interview of President Berisha with the Greek TV channel "Antena 
1," the president said that personally, he is determined to work 
not to increase but to ease tension in the relations between 
Albania and Greece, believing that this is in the interest of 
Albania, the Albanians, Greeks, Greece and other peoples and 
countries of the region. The future of the Albanian-Greek 
relations, he said, will be determined mainly by the tendency 
which will predominate in Greece. "If Greece complies with the 
European policy, Maastricht and CSCE principles, I am sure that 
the relations between Albania and Greece in a near future, if 
not today, will be friendly. There are many prerogatives 
testifying that they can be friendly. But if another tendency 
predominates in Greece of which many Greeks are proud, I would 
say, the Byzantine tendency, or the tendency which identifies 
the state with the church, in this case we would have to do with 
a difficult future in the relations between Albania and Greece." 
Mr. Berisha admitted he was amazed by yesterday's declarations 
of the Greek Government regarding the statement of the Albanian 
Foreign Ministry, which allegedly was irritating, because it 
mentioned the Cam problem. 
  "The Democratic Party and its government have raised this 
problem since it took over and will continue to tackle it. It is 
an undeniable problem. The Greek Government, too, has made a 
step forward and we have hailed it, because it has acknowledged 
the question of ownership. Therefore, I don't see any 
irritating element," Mr. Berisha said. Regarding the meeting 
of the foreign ministers of the two countries in Zurich, Mr. 
Berisha said that although the results were minimal, the meeting 
was positive because the two parties showed a clear will for 
positive results. They were open and sincere in tackling all 
problems. "In my interview with 'Antena 1,' I mentioned the 
Protocol of Florence, which is a protocol of the big powers' 
border commission, which has designated the frontier between 
Albania and Greece. No Greek Government has so far approved and 
ratified this protocol. Then, the question rises: In this 
context, what is the value of several repeated declarations by 
the Greek Government according to which Greece has no 
territorial claims at a time when senior representatives of this 
government include south Albania in the military schemes for the 
defence of Greece, consider south Albania as a Greek unliberated 
territory or 'Northern Epirus?' In this case it seems we have 
to do with a clear claim whose essence is precisely the non 
signing of the Florence Protocol. Therefore, we have insisted 
and will still insist on the signing of this protocol. 
  "I believe all the Albanians know a special merit of the 
current Greek Government, which several years ago lifted the law 
of war with Albania, a very absurd law, which penalized all the 
relations between the two countries. It would also be in its 
honour and merit to ratify the Florence Protocol," President 
Berisha said. 
  As regards the problem of the radio stations, Mr. Berisha 
reiterated his demand in the interview with "Antena 1" to 
interrupt transmission via Konica and Corfu radio stations which 
every day call on the Greek minority to join an armed uprising 
and topple the regime or make annexionist calls. On this 
occasion, Mr. Berisha congratulated the minority, who turn a 
deaf ear to these warmongering calls. "These calls," he said, 
"have minimal or no effect at all among the minority. Greece is 
a democratic country and let the human rights institutions and 
organisations, which are aware of the problem, evaluate its 
democracy. But it is common knowledge that the UN charter and 
other international documents prohibit neighbouring countries to 
launch propaganda against one another. Imagine for a moment as 
if all in Europe, in which powerful minority factors are 
intertwined, to try to solve the minority question through calls 
for war, annexations or secessions. So, I do not think my 
declarations in the interview with 'Antena 1,' received by 
Deutsche Welle, to be really so irritating," Mr. Berisha said 
adding that he has demanded and demands from the Greek 
Government a realistic policy to succeed in a good 
neighbourliness. 
  Asked about the incident in Kukes and assessment of the 
strikers' demands, President Berisha said that the group of the 
villagers removed because of the dam in 1978 "deserves a special 
and differentiated attention, like all the forgotten groups 
which deserve priority," Mr. Berisha said, considering a part 
of the demands of the Kukes' strikers as right, rational and 
which need solution. "But, there are demands which are 
absolutely unacceptable, because they penalize all the society. 
If a certain small group forwards demands which in some way are 
a punishment for the majority, this is and will always be 
unacceptable. A government can never be democratic when it 
resigns itself to absurd demands by a minority," Mr. Berisha 
stressed. 
  Concerning the problem of price rise in electric energy and 
of taxes, which have given rise to discussions, Mr. Berisha said 
that with the latest price fluctuation the Albanian Government 
completed one of the most difficult, most important aspects of 
the reform, the prices reform. "This is, certainly, the most 
painful side of the reform, but it is absolutely indispensable," 
President Berisha said stressing that absolutely all the payed 
energy is compensated. "In case we kept the price inherited from 
the past, we would practically preserve the socialist sector in 
energy, the sector of failure. 
  "Consequently, no investor would be interested in investing 
in the Albanians energy, which certainly makes up the major 
source and possibility of Albania to develop, integrate into the 
countries around, and to export to these countries," Mr. 
Berisha said, also mentioning the compensation for heating in 
the next winter, because the heating problem was not envisaged 
in the compensation package carried out by the government a 
month ago. 
  Regarding taxes, Mr. Berisha said that the taxes practised 
by 
the Albanian Government are completely acceptable and that can 
be coped with. He said there had been and is no state without 
taxes. The policy of taxes, seen through red glasses, seems an 
exploiting policy. The last regime had the severest taxes that 
any other regime in Albania had ever known. But, being 
hypocrite, the last regime had found the formula that 'we are a 
country without taxes,'" President Berisha said adding that 72 
per cent of the Albanians favour the market economy although 
knowing that they will pay taxes. "The gathering of taxes and 
their presentation before the parliament is the transparent 
procedure which shows to the citizen that it is not him that is 
dependent on the state, but it is the state that is dependent on 
him." 
  Regarding this problem, President Berisha said that the tax 
system to be applied next year is simpler and has to do with the 
value added tax, which is a Pan-European tax. 
  Responding to a question about the state secret and the 
forgiveness of several reporters punished for this problem, Mr. 
Berisha said that there is no secret for reporters. I have said 
and say this again. It would be regretful to think that the 
state is governed through instructions by the head of state. 
The state is governed by laws. My views are one thing and the 
law is another. I can have my own view but the law is a law and 
should be implemented, because the implementation of laws is an 
indispensable condition for the state functioning. "For me, the 
defence of freedom of the speech and its development, such as 
the defence of law and its consolidation, is and will remain a 
constant objective," Mr. Berisha said. 
  To the question by the Deutsche Welle reporter on the 
results 
of Berisha-Kinkel meeting and Albanian refugees in Germany, Mr. 
Berisha responded that in these talks the Albanian party raised 
the problem of the Albanian refugees stressing that their 
staying and special treatment in Germany is a great direct 
economic assistance Germany renders to Albania. "We understand 
that Germany has a very great number of refugees from the world 
over, but I think that at least from Europe the Albanians are 
more in trouble because there are less chances for employment 
and they all maintain one or two families in Albania. 
  "Certainly, I must say that the German state has maintained 
a 
tolerant stance towards the Albanian refugees, and we are 
grateful for this. But, we as a state, we want this tolerance 
to continue," President Berisha said. 
  To the question asking whether there was hesitation on the 
part of the police regarding the gathering of the Orthodox 
believers on the Easter day, Mr. Berisha responded: "I am 
amazed of the fact that they have asked permission from the 
police to organise the religious gathering. There is no need to 
ask permission from the police for religious ceremonies. There 
was a misunderstanding between an officer of the police and a 
representative of the church because the latter asked the 
guarantee of two processions. I think that this problem, which 
also became an intergovernmental problem, was very banal because 
the church's senior representative might very well address to 
the Foreign Ministry before the Greek Foreign Ministry 
interfered in the internal affairs of the Albanian state and the 
Albanian Autocephalous Church. Processions and religious 
ceremonies have never been prohibited in Albania. To my 
opinion, both the incident and the interference were totally 
unjustifiable," Mr. Berisha said. 
  Responding to a question by reporter Jupe about early 
elections, President Berisha said that it is a permanent demand 
by honoured forces of the opposition. He said that early 
elections are held in the event of a crisis in the country. 
"But, can one speak of a crisis in a country which ensures the 
highest economic growth in Europe, and this is done not on the 
basis of the five year plans, but in freedom. Can one speak of 
a crisis in a country with the parliament having an 
extraordinary high efficiency in laws? Can one speak of crisis 
with 70 per cent of Albanians considering the governing of the 
country as right? Here we only have to do with a crisis of 
posts, but I cannot say that there will be early elections for a 
crisis of posts. Elections are held when the country needs 
them. Therefore, I say that 1996 will surely be the year of 
general elections in Albania," Mr. Berisha said. 
  To the question regarding vouchers, the president responded 
that several patterns of their use in different countries are 
being studied and this will be completely a transparent 
procedure the parliament will decide upon or which will be 
discussed in a round table party talks. Mr. Berisha said that 
forgotten and unfavoured groups, that is former owners, the 
persecuted and unsheltered should be favoured, whereas the 
others will subject to the same chance. 
  Asked about the extreme right, which is now appearing on the 
Albanian political scene, President Berisha said that personally 
he favours no extreme, either right or left. Regarding the non 
approval of the Right Party by the Justice Ministry, as this 
party demands the return of the landlords, President Berisha 
said that they cannot be an illegitimate movement for this fact 
only. He expressed his personal view that free voting will 
resolve their future. 
  To a question about the Nano question, the president said 
that as regards this question one can refer to the Albanian 
justice. "There has been much clamour and politicisation about 
this question, but I tell those gentlemen who have raised that 
clamour that there is nothing political in it, it is a 
corruption affair, which is as much political for the Albanian 
former government members, who were involved in this affair, as 
it is for several Italian ministers under investigation, former 
Socialist Party and Christian Democratic Party leaders." 
  Asked about the clamour raised to shatter the three party 
coalition, Mr. Berisha said that the coalition had been and 
remains a serious achievement of the democratic forces, that 
this coalition yielded its fruits with the March 22 victory, and 
that the coalition has produced extraordinary impressive results 
over the last two year governing. "One cannot be unsatisfied 
with the coalition or co- governing, at a time when inflation, 
which was 400 percent, has dropped to 30 percent within two 
years." Citing the achievements of this co-governing, Mr. 
Berisha said that Albania, the poorest country in Europe, is now 
leading the economic growth. Among other achievements he cited 
those in the sector of privatization, the granting of dwelling 
houses or their selling at symbolic prices. "But, are there 
problems? I am head of state and there may be many articles of 
the Albanian legislation, which I wished to be different, 
however I must say that there is a consensus everywhere. Hence, 
the law on education is drafted by a social-democrat, or a group 
headed by a social-democrat," said President Berisha regarding 
the three-party coalition. 
  As regards the statement of the English minister, Hogg, that 
according to the British Government, Kosova is part of Serbia, 
and the prejudice to be made to this problem on the eve of the 
Geneva meeting, President Berisha said that "Minister Hogg 
expresses himself in favour of an autonomy like that of 1974. 
But I must say that it was not Britain that proclaimed the 
Republic of Kosova. I consider his visit to Kosova as a very 
important step. It has been one of the most significant events 
in the problem of crisis. President Rugova has welcomed the 
initiative of Minister Hogg as well as Belgrade's request for 
dialogue, in case they seriously comply with the procedure of 
solving the problem in the presence of a third party. No party 
has the right to refuse the third party, because alienation is 
great, something that cannot be denied. The third party both 
mediates and helps them. It would be very important that the 
coming Geneva meeting, alongside the Bosnia problem, also 
discusses and decides upon Kosova. 
  Regarding the indifference and procrastination of the work 
by 
the local administration and especially by the tribunals, the 
president said that there is no doubt that consolidation and 
perfection of the state administration will be a constant 
preoccupation and he fully agreed that there is unjustifiable 
inactivity and procrastination. Regarding the performance in 
tribunals, Mr. Berisha expressed his belief that procedures are 
more delayed than in other countries. But, he said, it is 
important that efforts are being made that the judicial power be 
an independent system and most significant for a rule of law. 
  Regarding the relations of the Albanian state with Italy, 
President Berisha said that they are relations with a clear 
perspective, because they are friendly relations. They are 
developing and will develop further. "Italy is a country which 
has rendered a great assistance to Albania during a very 
delicate period and, actually, it is the major investor in 
Albania. Cooperation with this developed country is of special 
interest for Albania," President Berisha said.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- "Due to good medical care 
and, of course, to the outcome of the Sunday elections, my state 
of health has improved a lot," Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) 
Chairman Gyula Horn told Hungarian Television today. In a car 
accident last Thursday, Horn suffered a fractured cervical 
vertebra, a broken wrist, and concussion. Now he is being 
treated in a Miskolc hospital. 
  Commenting on the Socialist success, Horn said that those 
who 
offer authentic policies are accepted by the people. He felt 
genuine change was badly needed in Hungary and could only occur 
if the Socialists won the May 29 second round too. 
  Horn denied the rumour that the MSZP would nominate Gabor 
Kuncze, prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ), for the prime minister's post. "This idea was 
not raised at all in the party. The prime minister will be 
chosen by the winner of the elections," Horn said.

<F P=106> [Regular Tuesday interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus </F>
by Lucie Weisova -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Weisova] Mr. Prime Minister, our country was 
yesterday accepted as an associate partner of the Western 
European Union [WEU], that is, not as a member but merely as a 
partner without the possibility of influencing the policy of 
that organization and without the opportunity of attending 
regular meetings in Brussels. Do you think this is a formality 
and does this partnership have concrete significance for our 
country? 
  [Klaus] I would not want to pass a strong judgment because I 
would unnecessarily stir the political waters both in our 
country and Europe. The various European integrational groupings 
have selected a strategy under which they would negotiate with 
countries like the Czech Republic, that is with postcommunist 
countries, in stages and steps, and not simply yes or no. They 
would negotiate in stages such as for semimembership, 
association, and the like. I respect this and accept it, since 
I believe that at the given time this probably cannot be 
otherwise for them, although this is not the case for us. I 
therefore accept it as it is. 
  [Weisova] You met the command of the Czech Army in Olomouc 
on 
Friday. Do they share the Czech Government's view on the 
Partnership for Peace program and do you think, after this 
meeting, that the Czech Army is able to fulfill its obligations 
following from Partnership for Peace? 
  [Klaus] I would first like to ask myself whether I think 
that 
the Czech Army is going through a transformation process of the 
same speed and thoroughness as the entire Czech Republic. This 
is the first question for me, and my answer is in the 
affirmative, that it is. 
  The second question is whether the Czech Army is getting 
ready to fulfill its own objectives. These objectives are not, 
first and foremost, about Europe and Partnership for Peace; they 
are in the first place about the Czech Republic and its defense. 
It is not right to formulate the question from the wrong end. 
  I think that the minister of defense repeated the Czech 
Government's basic view in the presence of all the assembled 
military representatives, that we proceed from our own 
capability and determination to defend this country. [passage 
omitted] All other agreements and cooperation treaties come 
second after this crucial starting point, on which we must not 
keep silent. I believe that the Czech Army is moving in this 
direction. 
  I cannot say that I am an expert who has visited dozens of 
military units -- this is not true. However, I was favorably 
impressed by what I saw in Olomouc and Praslavice. 
  The second question is whether we will be capable of taking 
part in the activities of the Partnership for Peace initiative. 
I can say that we will. I have been assured by our soldiers 
and commanders that the level of preparedness is very high and 
that their experience from various actions is always very 
favorable, I think. Groups of our soldiers and officers take 
part in various competitions, in shooting and other disciplines, 
and their results are very, very good. I believe that there is 
no need to be too modest. 
  [Weisova] Would you comment on the outcome of the 
parliamentary elections in Hungary? 
  [Klaus] I think that Hungary has been heading in this 
direction for a considerable time. It lacked a vigorous, 
radical, striking, and decisive transformation policy similar to 
what we have in our country. It lacked high-profile and 
charismatic personalities capable of uniting the Hungarian 
public around them in order to carry out radical social changes. 
  As for the implications it has for us, the Czech Republic is 
becoming a small nonleftist island in the center of Europe. 
This, I think, should compel each of our voters to reflect on 
this fact. I think it should compel each member of our 
government coalition parties to treat this valuable factor with 
very, very great caution, indeed.

  [Text] Warsaw (DDP/ADN) -- Rudolf Scharping, Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] chairman and prime minister of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, continued his talks in Warsaw on 
Wednesday. In the morning he met with Poland's Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak. They discussed how Poland could be brought 
closer to the European Union and to Western defense structures. 
Scharping assured Pawlak of the support of Germany's social 
democrats in the gradual implementation of this intention. 
  Talks are also planned for today with President Lech Walesa 
and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, at whose invitation 
Scharping is in Warsaw.

London"] 
  [Text] At the CITEX [expansion unknown] fair in London, 
which is attended by the participants from 25 Central and 
Eastern European countries, the symbol on the Macedonian [FYROM 
-- The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] flag -- the Sun of 
Vergina -- was printed in the form of a sunflower! However, the 
authentic Macedonian flag is printed on the invitation for 
applications to this fair. 
  The organizers of the Macedonian stand at this fair have 
confirmed that the invitation had the "trimmed" sun from the 
Macedonian flag printed on it, which is seen as a provocation! 
Today, the Macedonian Ambassador in Great Britain Risto 
Nikovski will ask for an official explanation from the CITEX 
organizers. It is unclear as to who made the change of symbols 
on the flag, printed on the invitation for the participation to 
the fair.

  [Text] Talks between the Bosniak and Croat delegations 
concerning the implementation of the Constitution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation are continuing in Vienna today. 
The Vienna talks yesterday centered on the cantons, that is, on 
their territory and borders. No agreement was reached on the 
territory and borders of the cantons in Herzegovina and central 
Bosnia, but new ideas were introduced and these formed the basis 
for the expert teams to propose new solutions. The proposals in 
question propose a smaller number of cantons that would have 
more territory and would contain approximately the same number 
of Bosniaks and Croats. 
  As for the Federal Government, it was agreed in principle 
that it would consist of all together 15 ministries, 11 regular 
ministries and four without portfolio. In addition to the prime 
minister and deputy prime minister, the government would consist 
of 17 members. Five ministries would be headed by Croatian 
ministers, while the rest would go to the Bosniaks, but every 
deputy minister would be from the ranks of the other nationality. 
  It was concluded that it was necessary to reach an overall 
agreement, rather than a partial one.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the </F>
Hungarian Socialist Party, by an unidentified correspondent from 
Horn's hospital bed in Budapest -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How are you feeling, Mr. Chairman? 
  [Horn] My condition has improved a lot. My hand has been 
operated on and the fracture in my cervical vertebra has been 
stabilized; my ribs will soon be healed as well and, of course, 
the election results have helped a lot to improve my mood. The 
most important lesson for me is that a wise, mature society 
lives here in this country. By this I mean that a lot of things 
can be said about a person, or some people, but if they are able 
to demonstrate an authentic policy, people will be taken by this 
and people will accept it. 
  [Correspondent] Is it this to which you attribute victory of 
the Socialists? 
  [Horn] I attribute it to the sense and wisdom of these 10.5 
million people, among them 8 million citizens with voting 
rights. Well, 58 of our individual parliamentary candidates are 
still competing -- in leading positions -- with others. We 
would like to gain a decisive majority of these seats because I 
am convinced that a substantial turnabout can be achieved in 
this country only if the Socialist Party wins the elections with 
a big majority. However, I have to add immediately that it is 
not for power that we are striving but for the beginning of a 
normal policy, for an end to hatred among people, for 
cooperation with any power which wants to do something for the 
country. 
  [Correspondent] Several analysts have said that it is clear 
that Gabor Kuncze [prime ministerial candidate for the Alliance 
of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] will be the Socialist Party's 
candidate for prime minister. A leading German paper has also 
written this. 
  [Horn] I do not know where the analysts have received this 
information. It has not even occurred to us. Excuse me, but 
the candidate for prime minister will be offered by the winning 
party. If we have a chance for victory, the Socialist will 
provide the prime minister. If the SZDSZ finishes ahead of us, 
this can be discussed. I maintain my view that individuals are 
not important, for whatever government comes into power, it will 
have a difficult job on its hands. What is important is the 
determination, the will, the program, and the team which exist 
within and around the Socialist Party. This is what will decide 
the next four years in Hungary. 
  I see everywhere that people have tremendous expectations 
regarding the coming period. A change has to be made and things 
will have to be put in order. The road of normal development 
has to be paved. Otherwise something that one of the ladies 
told me at an election forum will come to be: If you too 
disappoint us, if you do not win, we will all leave home. Let 
nobody leave this country, other than for touristic reasons. 
  The next act is the second round of the elections. After 
that, coalition negotiations with the other parties can 
commence. My opinion is that no democratic force should stand 
against another democratic force. If we find a group or party 
with whom agreement can be reached about the country's vital 
issues, than an agreement has to be made. There is a need for a 
turnabout but not for turning things upside down. 
  [Correspondent] If the Socialist Party is unable to find 
coalition partners, will it be willing to form a government on 
its own? 
  [Horn] A party supported by the majority of society (?does 
not need to) form a minority government. At the moment, it 
seems that the majority of society supports us. If this is also 
expressed in the votes on 29 May, then society can be certain 
that we will accomplish what we promised in our program. 
  This party does not want to exclude anyone. This party will 
be open to every decent force regardless of the outcome of the 
votes and [word indistinct] we will do everything to pull the 
country out of the crisis. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you for the interview and on behalf of 
the "Newsreel" program I wish you a speedy recovery. 
  [Horn] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kalina Stancheva] </F>
  [Text] [Stancheva] The cabinet meeting ended a few moments 
ago. Prime Minister Berov thinks that against the background of 
the support he had in overcoming the five no-confidence motions 
proposed so far by the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], the 
sixth such motion will have the same fate. This opinion, 
expressed by Professor Berov at the cabinet meeting, was 
reported by his spokesman. It was also reported that since the 
prime minister has not yet submitted to the National Assembly 
his proposed personal and structural changes in the cabinet, the 
no-confidence motion debate will apparently precede those 
changes, unless the National Assembly decides differently when 
it adopts its agenda. [passage omitted] 
  The topic of allowing foreign equipment to cross Bulgarian 
territory recently became a permanent item on the cabinet 
meetings' agenda. This time the relevant commission, in which 
representatives of several ministries participate, submitted, 
and the cabinet approved, a text which proposes to the National 
Assembly to adopt the following provisional decision, until the 
Constitutional Court rules on the matter: 
  Except in cases related to the stay or passing of foreign 
troops on or through Bulgarian territory, something that 
requires the permission of the National Assembly, noncombat 
flights of foreign aircraft will be allowed in accordance with 
the provisions of the Law on Civil Aviation. The entrance of 
foreign vessels or submarines in Bulgarian territorial waters, 
or visits to open ports, will be allowed in accordance with the 
Law on Sea Territory. In other words, in both cases the 
decision will be adopted by the executive power.

  [Text] I think there is a possibility that Lyuben Berov's 
statement on cabinet changes, which he is expected to make this 
Thursday, will receive greater parliamentary support, Aleksandur 
Tomov, leader of the Civic Alliance for the Republic [GOR], 
declared after his meeting with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the DPS 
[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]. 
  Today we may expect a very important development in the 
position of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] on approving 
the cabinet changes, assuming of course the demands of the 
parties making up the NSD are satisfied, Tomov told our reporter 
Antoaneta Puncheva. One should not permit any single political 
force to dominate the cabinet, Tomov said, because in such a 
situation it is certain that the cabinet will fall. 
  Aleksandur Tomov stated at a news conference held earlier 
that the GOR will issue a statement on the government changes 
and a statement on the government's intentions at the plenary 
session of parliament as soon as they are finally drafted.

  [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev expressed satisfaction with 
the resumption of contacts with the Greek New Democracy party 
[ND] during his meeting with this party leader, Miltiadhis 
Evert, which took place today. Presidential Spokesman Valentin 
Stoyanov had this to say about the meeting, which ended one hour 
ago: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] Relations between the two 
countries were assessed as very good. These are traditional 
relations that recently suffered a certain cooling off, which 
must be overcome. 
  From the Greek side it was pointed out that the parliament 
will soon ratify our country's provisional agreement with the 
European Union. The delay is not a premeditated act, but a 
result of the Greek elections. Evert proposed an interesting 
idea on preparing a treaty on the inviolability of borders that 
should be signed by all Balkan states. President Zhelev 
assessed the proposal as an interesting idea that merits serious 
attention. However, he pointed out that it could only be useful 
if all Balkan states without exception participate in the 
proposed treaty. Bulgaria and Greece could work actively in 
this respect, because they are two countries that have proved 
that they have no territorial claims vis-a-vis their neighbors, 
and conduct their policy in accordance with the Helsinki Act. 
Such a Balkan treaty could conform to Balladur's plan on 
European security. [end recording] 
  Evert came to Bulgaria to conduct consultations with 
Bulgarian politicians regarding his proposal. This became clear 
after his meeting with Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic, which took place early this 
afternoon. Evert also had a meeting with Filip Dimitrov, leader 
of the Union of Democratic Forces. Meetings with Bulgarian 
Socialist Party leader Zhan Videnov and Prime Minister Berov are 
also planned.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent </F>
Smallholders Party, by Ildiko Horvath: "Will You Extend Your 
Hand to the Hungarian Democratic Forum?"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] wants to step 
to the front of a national cooperation that is rather necessary 
now to change somewhat the situation that emerged after the 
elections, MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi declared recently. He 
thinks it is possible that the MDF will get in contact with the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP] in places where candidates of these 
parties are still running. We asked FKGP Chairman Jozsef 
Torgyan, whose party is also interested in driving back the 
left, whether they are ready to help out the MDF. 
  [Torgyan] The FKGP thinks that the MDF is definitely 
responsible for the current situation. We must start from this 
premise in developing our strategy. Our party continues to 
preserve its firm principles which it also preserved in the past 
years, and this is the condition for any cooperation. 
Therefore, we see primarily contacts with the KDNP as 
realistic. Besides, before the second round of elections, we do 
not have any points of confrontation that cannot be bridged. 
Certain concrete agreements in some given areas on supporting 
candidates are naturally not excluded. However, we will not 
renounce the possibilities of any of our candidates. 
  [Horvath] The MDF also hopes for such support. 
  [Torgyan] The policy of the MDF contributed to the tragedy 
of the national wing. They wanted to destroy the FKGP. By 
this, they revived the Communists. For any cooperation with the 
MDF, we need top-level principled coordination regarding the 
future policy of the two parties. Time will tell whether any 
cooperation can emerge regarding individual places.

  [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] are not averse to 
concluding an agreement on the mutual withdrawal of 
parliamentary candidates at a local level. This was stated by a 
leader of the KDNP in reply to a question from Hungarian radio. 
Tamas Isepy affirmed that he conducted election coordinating 
discussions yesterday with the SZDSZ's candidate for prime 
minister [Gabor Kuncze]. He also denied the NEPSZABADSAG report 
that Gabor Kuncze has rejected any local cooperation. 
  Candidates from the KDNP are in second place, while SZDSZ 
candidates are third -- or the reverse is true -- in several 
constituencies. This is why both parties have an interest in 
possibly withdrawing in favor of the other in the second round 
of the elections, the Christian Democratic politician said.

  [Excerpts] [Unidentified correspondent] I welcome to the 
studio Csaba Tabajdi, representative of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] and minority policy expert. The topic of our 
conversation is the MSZP's policy in connection with the 
Hungarians living beyond our borders. In the opinion of your 
party, how important is the issue of Hungarians beyond the 
borders? 
  [Tabajdi] I think that what is laid down in our program is 
clear for every political force in Hungary: Dealing with the 
Hungarians beyond the borders has to be one of the central 
elements of Hungarian politics at all times and in all 
circumstances. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Leading politicians in the MSZP have made 
some statements recently that could be misinterpreted. Let me 
ask you outright: Is the situation of Hungarian minorities a 
condition of good relations with neighboring countries? 
  [Tabajdi] I think that in the past weeks, in the heat of the 
election campaign, a lot of ambiguous statements were made. 
However, for me, the statement adopted by the Socialist Party's 
congress at the end of February is the guiding line. This laid 
down the three elements of Hungarian foreign policy, which are 
in coordinated relations with each other. These are: 
Integration with Western Europe, relations with the neighbors, 
and the treatment of Hungarians living beyond the borders. We 
have elaborated in detail in this document our party's minority 
policy, stating that these three elements are of equal 
importance. Thus, there is no return to the Kadar era of 
mocking silence. [passage omitted] 
  However, we not only disagree with the politics of that time 
but also with the past four years' government politics. This 
means that without discarding or sacrificing the issue of 
Hungarians beyond the border on the altar of bilateral 
relations, much more should have been done in the past four 
years for bilateral relations. Let me bring a concrete example, 
a practical one, for we are very practical; at the moment, 
Hungary has no valid agreement on investment protection and 
preventing double taxation with any of her neighbors. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] What do you consider more 
important, the conclusion of basic treaties with our neighbors 
or settling the situation of Hungarians living beyond the 
borders? 
  [Tabajdi] The two are inseparable. [passage omitted] These 
basic treaties have to answer two vital questions that are the 
problems of the region; one of them is the question of the 
borders. [passage omitted] On the other hand, there is a wish 
on behalf of Hungary -- since we have a fait accompli produced 
by the tragic history of the 20th century -- that the Hungarians 
beyond our border should, within the given conditions, be given 
the rights of autonomy by which they can preserve their 
identity. If a basic treaty does not settle these two unsolved 
issues, it is worthless. 
  I would like to add, and this is also included in our 
program, that in the question of basic treaties, coordination 
has to be carried out with the would-be opposition prior to 
signing. Prior to ratification, the democratic institutions of 
the Hungarians beyond the border also have to be involved. 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] How do you evaluate the 
statement of [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn that there is no need 
for the office dealing with the affairs of Hungarians beyond the 
borders? 
  [Tabajdi] [passage omitted] It is debatable how this office 
should be run, however, it is absolutely necessary. [passage 
omitted] So, regarding Hungarians beyond the borders, the new 
government, shortly after assuming power, has to lay down the 
basic principles, just as the Antall government did very 
correctly in 1992. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What does the MSZP intend to do with Duna 
TV? 
  [Tabajdi] I wrote an article in NEPSZABADSAG on 11 April 
that 
a turnabout was needed in Hungarian minority policy. One of the 
sentences in this article was that despite all the 
organizational imperfections and personal monopolizing, Duna TV 
filled a gap of decades. [passage omitted] Obviously, Duna TV 
has to be maintained. We think that it has to be maintained by 
the budget. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F>
Young Democrats, by Imre Bednarik; place and date not given: 
"New Age in Hungary"] 
  [Text] It is perfectly clear that one of the most 
important periods of Hungarian transition has ended. A new age 
is beginning in Hungary because it has become obvious that 
people's political taste is completely different from what it 
was four years ago. It is the job of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz] to assess the situation and to launch a new 
program on this basis, Fidesz Chairman Laszlo Orban told PESTI 
HIRLAP. 
  [Bednarik] Do you agree with the statement that the Fidesz 
is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, loser in the 
elections because, although it is an opposition party, it did 
not even manage to reach its 1990 results in the first round of 
the elections? 
  [Orban] I agree, but with the note that, nevertheless, it 
was the government parties that lost most. It is also certain 
that the Fidesz's performance was way below expectations and in 
this sense we are indeed the losers of these elections. 
  [Bednarik] On the night of the elections, reacting to the 
results, you said that the country wanted a major correction 
rather than the half-turn advocated by the Fidesz. At the same 
time, the Fidesz defined itself as a nationally committed 
liberal center party -- as such, it should have found support 
with the broadest groups of society. 
  [Orban] Unfortunately, this did not happen. The country's 
general mood was much more radical that the Fidesz's program. 
Since we decided not to join this radicalism, our politics had 
to go against the main drift. This was only enough to get the 
number of votes we did on 8 May. 
  [Bednarik] Why did more people support the Free Democrats 
when the liberal parties had put up very similar programs and 
they had even coordinated these? 
  [Orban] I cannot yet give an exact answer to this. Perhaps 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] advocated a much more 
radical change than we did. If, at a discussion, I said 
half-turn, [SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate] Gabor Kuncze 
always emphasized the need for a full turn. When I spoke about 
the danger of restoration of people in their positions, the 
SZDSZ said that this did not have much chance. The Fidesz 
distanced itself from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] much 
more than the SZDSZ did. Therefore, the differences between the 
two liberal parties must have been quite clear for the voters. 
  [Bednarik] Is it possible to maintain the cooperation 
agreement with the SZDSZ in spite of the fact that this will 
further damage the Fidesz's final chances? 
  [Orban] When a party makes an agreement it should adhere to 
it. Up to now, the Fidesz has adhered to all of its agreements 
and it does not wish to change this practice. 
  [Bednarik] How was the Fidesz's failure affected by the fact 
that, as Fidesz chairman, you conducted a very powerful campaign 
against the MSZP? 
  [Orban] This is what is called sailing against the wind. I 
think that our strong criticism of the MSZP did not have an 
effect on the Fidesz's election results. 
  [Bednarik] Then what did? 
  [Orban] With hindsight, I believe that we did not 
participate in criticizing the government as powerfully as the 
MSZP or the SZDSZ. Therefore, the relationship between the 
Socialists and the Young Democrats did not influence the voters. 
  [Bednarik] What is the hidden message of the first round of 
the elections? 
  [Orban] It is perfectly clear that one of the most important 
periods of Hungarian transition has ended. From now on, Hungary 
has a new period in time because it has come to light that 
people's political taste is different from that of four years 
ago. It is the Fidesz's job to assess the situation and to 
create a new strategy based on this, to prepare for analyzing 
the government program, and to prepare for the local government 
elections in a few months' time. 
  [Bednarik] Will the failure have any personal consequences? 
  [Orban] The mandate of the party leadership is for two 
years, until 1995. Therefore, in theory, it is not possible to 
replace people in the party. However, the chairman and all 
deputy chairmen believe that the elections are an important 
enough event for the Fidesz also to reconsider its personnel 
decisions. We are not intending to resign but we will return 
our mandates if the congress that is soon to be convened wishes 
to elect new leaders. In this case, we will also overcome the 
obstacles in our statute which would prevent the changes. 
  [Bednarik] What happens if the membership decides in favor 
of change? 
  [Orban] In that case, I hope that they will find the people 
who can better adjust to the new situation than we can. 
  [Bednarik] In view of the election results after the first 
round, Zoltan Gal, the MSZP's parliamentary group leader, did 
not exclude the possibility of cooperating with the Fidesz if 
the attitude of the Young Democrats changed. 
  [Orban] I remember my late class teacher Geza Rimmel saying 
similar things. I never took him seriously, either. 
  [Bednarik] Does this mean that there is still no chance of 
the Fidesz entering into a coalition with the MSZP? 
  [Orban) We have not received such a request from the MSZP. 
I maintain that while I am the Fidesz's chairman, it is not 
possible to cooperate with this MSZP.

  [Text] According to a ruling by the chief prosecutor's 
office in Budapest, the Hungarist Movement cannot be registered 
by the court under the prevailing law. The prosecutor's office 
have informed the Budapest court about this in a letter. The 
court is to decide on the movement's application for 
registration in an extrajudicial procedure. 
  The prosecutor's office drew the court's attention to the 
fact that the real aims of the Hungarist Movement are 
demonstrated by its leaders' statements, from which it emerges 
that they regard Ferenc Szalasi, the leader of the former Arrow 
Cross movement, as their ideal, and even the name of their 
organization is identical to the former fascist movement. In 
the peace treaty concluded at the end of World War II, Hungary 
undertook an obligation that it would not allow fascist 
organizations to function.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Liviu Ioan Stoiciu: "Ion Iliescu Attacks From </F>
the Rear"] 
  [Excerpts] We are not doing very well; there is something 
"in the air," a kind of nervousness which cannot be properly 
explained. [passage omitted] The amazing thing is that our 
chosen ones at the top of the political pyramid at home are 
doing pretty badly too. Nevertheless, it is not their health 
that is giving them trouble! They are faring rather badly in the 
"internal" struggle for power that is being waged in silence. 
In their endeavors to strengthen their current positions, they 
are making the others suspicious! The one who is pulling the 
most strings is none other than Romania's big brother, Ion 
Iliescu, the republican of the Central Committee of the 
"reformed" Romanian Communist Party [PCR], who takes great care 
to ensure his certain perpetuation as the country's president. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the last few days, Ion Iliescu treacherously administered 
a death blow to his "disciple," Adrian Nastase [speaker of the 
Chamber of Deputies and executive president of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] who has grown too big for his 
boots, who has become too "famous" (obviously Ion Iliescu has 
not forgiven him the fact that he enjoys the most support from 
the electorate, as revealed by a recent public opinion poll 
widely disseminated in the media -- maybe that was the cause of 
all his misfortune), and who has accumulated too much political 
capital through his positions in the ruling party and the 
Chamber of Deputies, of which he is the leader, something that 
makes him omnipresent to the public at large, thanks to 
television and radio coverage. Therefore, it is not accidental 
that the government took care to splash on the front page of 
ADEVARUL of 27 April (when Adrian Nastase was abroad) an article 
entitled: "How Mr. Nastase Got Hold of Several Houses." From 
that article, we learn that the current president of the PDSR, 
of the Chamber of Deputies, and even of the Romanian Diaspora 
(reunited at a recent Congress in Baile Herculane -- this is how 
far the political paranoia of accumulating as many functions of 
president as possible can go!) is nothing but a second rate 
Mafioso, who is illegally acquiring villas through intrigue and 
is also involved in various profitable shoddy deals -- under the 
cover of relatives -- with cosmetics, pubs, and shops, thus 
forcing the state's hand! 
  All of a sudden, the readers realized who Adrian Nastase -- 
the man who dreams of becoming Romania's president -- really 
was: a "cheat with functions," capable of resorting to any 
abuses to satisfy his own interests. All of a sudden, we all 
reminded that Adrian Nastase (his father-in-law is the former 
nomenklatura man of the Nicolae Ceausescu regime Angelo 
Miculescu, who is obviously a big businessman today -- you 
realize what kind of world Nastase belongs to) is the one who 
has definitively betrayed Romania, along with Ion Iliescu, by 
signing the perestroyka treaty with the Soviet Union after the 
revolution, in his capacity as minister of foreign affairs. 
[passage omitted] 
  Last week, another significant article against him was 
published in ROMANIA LIBERA on 4 June by the alleged 
"independent" Antonie Iorgovan (another slimy apparatchik, 
currently judge at the Constitutional Court) entitled: "About 
the Cockiness of the Power's People and Their Lack of 
Restraint." [passage omitted] Driven hard into a corner, Adrian 
Nastase stated two days later that everything happening to him 
is a "new press campaign against me." A press campaign 
orchestrated by whom? Does he mean that our larger-circulation 
newspapers have also joined the early electoral campaign against 
Adrian Nastase and have nothing else to do than tow Ion 
Iliescu's line? Well, if this is the case, we are going through 
some pretty hard times ourselves. It seems that the Gods are 
still deserting us...

  [Text] Sali Berisha, president of the Republic of Albania, 
arrived on an official visit at about 2120 today at Otopeni 
Airport. This visit, which is the first ever by a head of the 
Albanian state, is an extremely important event in the relations 
between the two countries, relations that, in an interview 
granted to us before he had left his country, President Berisha 
termed as friendly. During the visit the Friendship and 
Cooperation Treaty between Romania and Albania will be signed, 
as well as other conventions intended to establish, as President 
Berisha said, the legal basis for our close cooperation. 
  The Albanian president is accompanied by Finance Minister 
Piro Dishnica, Maksim Konomi, chairman of the Science and 
Technology Committee, and other officials. 
  Upon his arrival, the president of Albania was met by a 
honor 
mission headed by Dan Mircea Popescu, state minister and labor 
and social protection minister. The official reception of 
President Berisha by Romanian President Ion Iliescu will take 
place tomorrow morning at Cotroceni Palace.

  [Text] After visiting Hungary the Albanian delegation 
headed by President Berisha arrived in Romania last night. The 
official welcoming ceremony was held at Cotroceni Palace this 
morning. Presidents Berisha and Iliescu then held a 
tete-a-tete, and at 1000 both delegations held official talks. 
  Taking the floor, Romanian President Ion Iliescu thanked 
President Berisha for the visit to Romania and considered it an 
important step for the further development of political 
relations and economic cooperation. He made explained the 
economic situation in Romania and the reforms undertaken on the 
road to a market economy. He pointed out that alongside the 
historic ties that exist between our both countries it is high 
time to strengthen the economic and political cooperation that 
is mutually advantageous to countries that have just emerged 
from fierce dictatorships. 
  President Berisha briefed President Iliescu on the course of 
reforms in Albania. He stressed that despite the unfavorable 
geopolitical situation, the results of reform are positive. 
  Regarding the situation in the Balkans, he stressed once 
again that the main question in the Balkans is the Albanian 
question. Albania does not support a change of borders through 
violence, but demands democratic space for Albanians and 
freedoms and rights pertaining to them from the Helsinki 
Charter. As long as Albanians demand the implementation of CSCE 
principles, the international community and the region should be 
seriously engaged in solving their problems. The idea that 
Kosova is Serbia's problem is a half-baked idea and seeks to 
provoke conflict, President Berisha stressed. 
  All Balkan peoples have their own national problems, but no 
one wants to resolve them through war, as Serbia does. If 
Serbia does not give up the idea of Greater Serbia, Belgrade 
will involve the whole region in a war. The division of Kosova 
or Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] is equal to conflict. Milosevic's refusal to conduct a 
dialogue with the legitimate representatives of 2 million Kosova 
Albanians is absurd. We support dialogue in the presence of a 
third party. It is within this framework that we assess the 
efforts by British Minister Hogg during his last visit to 
Belgrade and Kosova. 
  I am convinced, President Berisha continued, that an 
acceptable solution can be found. However, since the situation 
is equivalent to a time bomb, this runs the risk of turning into 
a conflict that includes not only Albanians. 
  President Berisha then held a warm meeting with 
representatives of the Cultural Union of Albanians in Romania at 
the Albanian Embassy. 
  In a meeting with reporters, President Berisha stressed that 
to continue the dialogue to resolve problems and improve 
relations with Greece, we intend to propose another meeting of 
the foreign ministers of both countries in Tirana. We see the 
Zurich meeting as positive, because both ministers expressed 
their clear willingness to improve the relations. We hope that 
this willingness and predisposition will be further strengthened 
and that they will yield fruit.

  [Text] President Berisha was received this afternoon at 
the Chamber of Deputies by Chairman Adrian Nastase and Senate 
Vice President Ioan Lup. President Berisha acquainted the 
Romanian parliament representatives with Albania's achievements 
in the field of legislation. There exists greater cooperation 
possibilities with Romania, he said, not only in the field of 
economy and politics but also between our parliaments. 
  President Berisha noted that we are for dialogue between 
Prishtina and Belgrade in the presence of a third party. For 
this, we demand that you insist that Belgrade enter a dialogue. 
President Berisha also requested Romania's support for 
Albania's full membership to the Council of Europe [CE], since 
Albania long ago fulfilled conditions for this membership. 
  For their part, the Romanian representatives said that they 
feel close to Albania and regard cooperation with the Albanian 
parliament highly. They assured President Berisha that they 
will strongly support Albania's full membership in the CE. The 
meetings are to continue this evening and tomorrow morning.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Shpetim Roqi from Bucharest] </F>
  [Text] Last night Romanian President Ion Iliescu hosted an 
official dinner to honor President Berisha at Cotroceni Palace. 
In exchanging greetings, both presidents expressed the desire 
and goodwill to further develop bilateral relations. Worried 
about the situation in the Balkans, both presidents committed 
themselves to prevent, through diplomatic policy and dialogue, 
the spread of conflict and work for the stability in the region. 
  This morning President Berisha started his activities with a 
visit to a small church, more than 200 years old, in the center 
of Bucharest, which for a long time was known as the Albanian 
Church, called Dintrozi [as heard] in Romanian. 
  Addressing the priest of the church, President Berisha said: 
I have come here to visit this church, which is a great symbol 
for all Albanians, as Archbishop Fan Noli, one of the most 
distinguished figures in letters, the church, and the Albanian 
political world, addressed his prayers here. I have also come 
here because I pray to God to bless Albania and Romania, and 
Albanians of Romania, including Viktor Eftimiu, along with many 
other Romanian personalities of Albanian origin. 
  Meanwhile, the daily newspapers of Bucharest and the radio 
and television continue to publish and broadcast news on the 
visit of President Berisha in Romania. At 1100, Berisha gave an 
exclusive interview for Romanian Television. After that, Berisha 
held a meeting with Emil Constantinescu, leader of the 
Democratic Convention. At this meeting Berisha acquainted his 
interlocutor with developments in Albania, stressing the 
achievements of the shock therapy and a group of completely 
social measures. 
  Honoring the sublime act of the martyrs of Timisoara, 
Berisha 
said: They not only gave their lives against Ceausescu's 
dictatorship, but they shook the foundations of dictatorship in 
Albania and encouraged Albanians to raise and liberate 
themselves from it. They will always be honored in Albania. 
  President Berisha also expressed thanks for the help that is 
being given to Albanian students in Romania, as Constantinescu 
is rector of the Bucharest University and dean of the Romanian 
rectors. 
  For his part, Mr. Emil Constantinescu said that we in 
Romania 
need the Albanian experience, as it is more important to know 
than the experience in other countries as the United States or 
Germany. Our countries have suffered from fierce dictatorships 
and the transition started under grave conditions. That is why 
we are interested in getting acquainted with the Albanian 
experience. Your visit here offers a very good opportunity. 
  Regarding President Berisha's request for supporting the 
Democratic Party membership in the European Democratic Union, 
Constantinescu committed himself to render his contribution. 
President Berisha also gave an interview for the largest 
opposition paper, ROMANIA LIBERA.

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Charles Redman, the U.S. 
President's special envoy, arrived in Sarajevo this evening. 
With Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, he discussed the results of the agreement signed in 
Vienna today. Senada Cumurovic has the report. 
  [Cumurovic] Charles Redman, who briefed President 
Izetbegovic 
on the course of the talks, which ended in Vienna today, and on 
the results [words indistinct], made the following statement: 
  [Begin Redman recording] I believe that the progress made 
during the talks in Vienna with regard to the federation is a 
major positive step. I think that the form on which the 
agreement is founded is a solid basis for good relations between 
Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks. However, the federation is only 
one part of the agreement. Bosnian Serbs are the other part. I 
have to say that I will have a very important meeting on Friday 
in Geneva where the most important representatives of the UN 
Security Council member countries and the EU will be present. 
The meeting is important from the point of view of future 
progress. The work of the contact group over the past few weeks 
is the basis of our talks. President Izetbegovic and I agreed 
that the most important part is the protection of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's territorial integrity and the preservation 
of a way toward coexistence between Bosnian Serbs and the 
federation in some form of relationship. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] In his statement for the press, President 
Izetbegovic assessed the agreement reached in Vienna today as 
significant, partly because of its influence on the course of 
the talks scheduled for 13 May in Geneva. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] This is a very important thing 
and it will strengthen our future negotiating position. Of 
course, we are awaiting with keen interest [words indistinct]. 
It is a big chance for peace and we will do everything in our 
power not to spoil this chance. We will, of course, try to 
ensure that this is not done at the expense of our people. With 
the maximum of good will we will examine the proposals. It is 
with great curiosity that we are expecting the proposals of the 
international community. We hope it will not be a reward for 
aggression and for ethnic cleansing. We are expecting just 
peace proposals. [words indistinct] It is now up to the 
international community to voice its opinion [words indistinct] 
and that it is far better for us to wait and see what proposals 
will be put before us. It is a well- known fact that the 
withdrawal of Serb troops from the occupied territory is one of 
our conditions, the other and most important one being the 
preservation of the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We will see to what extent the international community will be 
prepared to [word indistinct] our demands. 
  [Announcer] Although at this stage the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
delegation is not party to the talks, as President Izetbegovic 
said, Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicackic will nonetheless be present 
in Geneva. Let us say in the end that the journalists were most 
keen to find out about how cadre issues in the federation will 
be resolved. Neither President Izetbegovic nor Charles Redman 
could say anything specific about this, i.e., they did not speak 
about any concrete problems regarding the federation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by correspondent Senad 
Hadzifejzovic on 11 May; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, commented on the Bosniak-Croat 
agreement reached in Vienna for Bosnia-Herzegovina TV this 
evening. His host was Senad Hadzifejzovic. 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that this is a good agreement. Of 
course there were a lot of difficulties, particularly over the 
issue of cantons, but my first impression is that this was done 
well. I am particularly pleased by the solution envisaging the 
Neretva and central Bosnia cantons which will be typical 
cantons. Power will be shared in them and the Bosnian idea will 
be preserved in a way. I think that this is the best quality of 
the solution. Of course, the problem of implementation remains. 
I am afraid we could again have the problem of finding a way to 
implement the implementation [as heard]. I think that this 
indicates the preparedness of both sides to establish the 
principle of coexistence again. 
  [Hadzifejzovic] Most of the media attention is focused on 
the 
post of the president and the upcoming changes. How do you 
comment on this as the current head of state? 
  [Izetbegovic] I remain president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, a political body that should be a symbol of the 
state's survival as a whole. This is not a problem. I said 
yesterday and I sent a letter to our delegation in Vienna saying 
that this issue must not be an obstacle to the agreement. If a 
satisfactory agreement is reached in connection with cantons and 
other, in my view, more important issues, then this issue is not 
important. One also has to bear in mind that the president's 
term is restricted to six months and that a Bosniak has to 
become a president after the first elections. If elections are 
not held within six months there will be a rotation. This issue 
is not so important also because the vice president has great 
powers, i.e., main decisions will be made by consensus. 
  [Hadzifejzovic] Does this mean that we will have the 
existing 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency alongside the rotating president 
and vice president of the Bosniak-Croat Federation? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, if you remember, the constitutional law 
provides for this until the implementation of the new 
constitution and the Federation. It is necessary to preserve 
the Presidency as a political body that represents the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We should not take a step in the wrong 
direction by disbanding the existing state in favor of the 
Federation. We still insist on the survival of the republic as 
a whole and the existing Presidency represents the republic 
[word indistinct]. The future president of the Federation will 
represent only a part of the republic. This was already 
envisaged by the constitutional law. 
  [Hadzifejzovic] Mr. President, in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
television newscasts we have, on several occasions, dealt with 
this question of the future organization of the federation as 
opposed to the current organization. There will obviously be 
state organs that will emerge following the first postwar 
elections, while there will also exist the state organs that 
stem from the agreement between the Bosniaks and the Croats. 
Do you fear that there may also be some problems in these 
circumstances? 
  [Izetbegovic] No, I do not. It is a fact that the Assembly 
remains as a single entity. It has, however, as people say, 
this assembly has four faces. Nevertheless, it is a single 
entity. Sometimes it operates in one capacity; sometimes it does 
in another. 
  There will be one government, not two. The presidency is to 
remain. I believe there will be no major problems in this 
respect if these powers are defined more narrowly. In other 
words, this current presidency has had to remain as a body that 
represents the republic. 
  The problem of the army, of course--this fourth 
institution--the army is the most problematic issue. Hardly 
anyone has managed to merge two armies into one. This is an 
experiment we are going to try to carry out. I fear there will 
be difficulties. This process is going to be far more difficult 
than others. As for the rest, I do not think there will be any 
major problems. This is particularly so because there will be a 
single government. 
  [Hadzifejzovic] What is your comment on the U.S. role in the 
signing of the Bosniak.... 
  [Izetbegovic, interrupting] Their role was very positive and 
stimulating. Believe me, I think that, in part, their help is 
very direct. The fact that this took place in a U.S. Embassy 
helped in resolving some things. I have to reveal something. 
The negotiations were in serious crisis last night. Literally, 
they almost collapsed. I was talking to our delegation, to all 
the members. It was a long conversation, and the Americans 
mediated in such a way as to prevent the negotiations from 
stalling. Thank God, everything eventually turned out all right. 
  As for my talks with Mr. Redman, let me tell you that these 
talks, relating to the next meeting of the contact group, are in 
progress. 
  [Hadzifejzovic] Following this meeting, one can expect the 
next stage in the implementation of the Bosniak-Croat agreement. 
The position, the status, of Serbs in this future federation 
has been outlined? 
  [Izetbegovic] First of all, the Serbs should accept this 
federation. In other words, what is going to take place on 
Friday at the meeting in Geneva relates mostly to the future of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state and, of course, our relations with 
the Serbs, as well as relations between the federation and the 
regions populated by Serb majorities--most of which are 
currently under the control of Karadzic's army. We will have to 
do something conceptually in order to save the country's unity. 
I believe that this is our priority interest: to preserve the 
external borders of the country. This is, in a sense, our 
interest. It will be our main goal on Friday. 
  [Hadzifejzovic] Will this require some concessions on our 
part? 
  [Izetbegovic] I cannot figure this out at the moment. It 
would not make sense if I were to reveal them at the moment. 
[words indistinct] what kind of concessions. I want to say that 
the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state will be the 
top item on this list of priorities.

  [Excerpts] Over the last 24 hours, Serb forces carried out 
sporadic provocations on the Stolac front. In Stolac the 
[Croat-Muslim] Vienna negotiations are being followed with great 
attention. 
  [Raguz] This is Ivo Raguz reporting for Herceg-Bosna Radio 
from Stolac. Over the last 24 hours, members of the Serb army 
carried out several provocations from their Ljubljenica 
stronghold by firing fragmenting ammunition from antiaircraft 
guns at the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] defense lines on the 
Hodovo plateau, but fortunately with no serious consequences. 
[passage omitted] 
  The negotiations between the Croatian and Muslim delegations 
in Vienna are being followed here with a great deal of 
attention. Reports full of stereotyped phrases and cliches 
coming from Vienna speak about particular attention being paid 
to the disputed areas of central Bosnia and the municipalities 
of Stolac and Mostar in Herzegovina. 
  As to Stolac, it is a well-known fact that the Croatian 
Democratic Community [HDZ] scored a convincing victory here at 
the first multiparty elections, that HVO units comprising 
exclusively Croats and including -- and this should be stressed 
-- one Albanian, were instrumental in liberating the Stolac area 
from the [Serb] aggressor. While the Croats fought to liberate 
these areas, others, at the explicit recommendation of Alija 
Izetbegovic, strutted around saying this is not their war, while 
at the same time being very eager to accept humanitarian aid. 
  The evident difficulties in the distribution of power and 
the 
allocation of the leading posts in the [Muslim-Croat] federation 
indicate that the other side's attitude is: What is mine will 
remain mine, and what is yours will be both mine and yours; even 
on your territory I will be the one in charge and you will be 
subordinate to me. Aware of the lessons of the past, we can 
still hear the words which translated into reality mean: 
outvoting, dominating, and negating everything that is Croat. 
Has not the other side, despite the specific nature of the 
Washington agreement, tried -- by copying the Serbs -- to build 
the collective guilt of the Croatian people into the issue of 
the distribution of the leading posts in the federation and to 
declare who the victims and who the beneficiaries are. We must 
learn from history to ensure that it does not repeat itself. 
  In conclusion, even if these were relevant steps toward 
peace, in view of all that has happened so far and without the 
involvement of the third side, it all looks like counting one's 
chickens before they are hatched.

<F P=106> [Report by Amir Hodzic from Vienna -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Hodzic] Today, after thorough work over five 
days, the Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatian delegations in Vienna 
reached an agreement on the number and borders of cantons of the 
Federation, the composition and the [word industinct] of the 
composition of the government and the [word indistinct] of the 
Federation. 
  There will be eight cantons in the Federation: (Hum)-Sana, 
Posavina, Tuzla-[word indistinct], Zenica-Doboj, Gorazde, 
(?Upper) Drina, Central Bosnian, and (?Central Herzegovina). 
  After the agreement was reached, we asked Prime Minister Dr. 
Haris Silajdzic to tell the listeners and viewers of Radio and 
Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina all that has been agreed and to 
assess the importance of the agreement reached. 
  [Silajdzic] The agreement reached is, so far, the most 
serious step toward reaching the final peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in preserving the integrity and 
sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
solutions endorsed are the most important concrete step in 
implementing the Washington agreement, the current Washington 
agreement and [word indistinct] the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  These solutons, that is, we [words indistinct] the question 
of establishing cantonal borders are maximally democratic, they 
enable a full national equality, economic appropriateness, a 
respect for [word indistinct], logical, and [words indistinct]. 
In a (?concrete way), these solutions should bring back 
confidence between the two peoples and ensure a new quality 
[word indistinct] in which [words indistinct] all those people 
will be eliminated who want (?dispute) and who do not wish the 
joint life of Bosniaks and Croats, as well as those who [words 
indistinct] Serbs and others who feel [words indistinct]. These 
solutions, in a way, go beyond the Costitution as they offer 
parity decision-making in two cantons, which is a higher level 
of democratic solution, something that proves there is a 
readiness to really build [words indistinct]. 
  The Croatian and Bosniak peoples and all the people who feel 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is their own republic will certainly receive 
this agreement with relief and delight. It has been left to us 
to participate in the implementation of this agreement together. 
This is a difficult, very difficult, and very responsible task. 
I hope that we shall, all together, once again, prove that we 
can overcome this [word indistinct]. 
  [Hodzic] Mr. Silajdzic, what has been agreed about the 
government [words indistinct]? 
  [Silajdzic] It will be proposed to the Constitutional 
Assembly that the first (?president) of the Federation (?in the 
transient period) should be a candidate from the Croatian people 
and in the same period, the (?vice president) of the Federation 
is from the Bosniak people. Thus, when the six-month period 
expires, the duty of the president will be performed by a member 
of the Bosniak people and the duty of (?vice president) by a 
member of the Croatian people. 
  The first president of the Federation after the transitory 
period will be elected from the ranks of the Bosniak people. 
  At the government reshuffle, it will be ensured that the 
duty 
of the prime minister is taken by a member of the Bosniak people 
and the duty of deputy prime minister by a member of the 
Croatian people. The deputy prime minister will head the 
Ministry of (?Defense). 
  Amendments to the Law on the Government of the Federation 
have been proposed, so that the Government of the Federation is 
composed of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, 17 
ministers, and four ministers without portfolio. Ministers from 
the Bosniak people will be heading the following (?ministries): 
the Ministry for Energy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of [words indistinct], 
the Ministry of (?Zoning), the Ministry for Refugees, the 
Ministry of Police, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of 
Culture. Ministers from the Croatian people will be heading the 
Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Finances, the Ministry of 
Justice, the Ministry of [word indistinct], and the Ministry of 
[word indistinct]. Of four ministers without portfolio, one 
will be a member of the Croatian people. 
  The territory of the Federation has been established on the 
basis of jointly adopted criteria. 
  After four days of work, this agreement has been (?reached). 
[words indistinct] has also been [words indistinct] with special 
administration: the Central-Bosnian and (?Neretva) [words 
indistinct]. Thus, amendments to the Constitution of the 
Federation will be made in conformity with the [word 
indistinct], so that in conformity with the (?solution) about 
the Federation, these cantons ensure the (?independence) of the 
peoples in the Federation. 
  [Hodzic] Prime minister, please tell us at the end what 
(?has been left) to do after this Vienna agreement, so that the 
(?Federation) [words indistinct]? 
  [Silajdzic] We have already ageed to sign this agreement on 
Saturday [14 May], to [word indistinct] and [words indistinct]. 
  [Hodzic] There is one more piece of information from Vienna: 
The agreed documents will be signed in Geneva on Saturday. 
  This was Amir Hodzic reporting from Vienna for the 
Radio-Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Report by Bettina Roither] </F>
  [Text] For five days, Muslims and Croats have held 
negotiations at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. These two ethnic 
groups have agreed on the form and the structure of a future 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiators were Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian-Croat top politician Kresimir 
Zubak, and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. Minister 
President Silajdzic reported on the agreement 20 minutes ago: 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed 
German translation] We have reached an agreement on the external 
borders of the federation and on the internal borders of the 
individual cantons. We believe that a great step in the 
direction of a comprehensive peace solution in the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been taken -- a great step to preserve 
unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We believe that 
not only Bosniaks and Croats, but all who regard 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as their home will work toward the 
implementation of this agreement. [end recording] 
  On 14 May, the agreement between the Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats is to be signed in Geneva. It provides for a federation 
that comprises 58 percent of the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina. By 
the way, 70 percent of the territory is currently being held by 
the Serbs, with whom no negotiations were held here -- thus, one 
reckoned, so to speak, without one's host, although he had 
conquered the territory. 
  In the new Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina there are to be 
eight cantons, two under Croatian leadership, four under Muslim 
leadership, according to the respective majorities, and two with 
equal structures, that is, central Bosnia and the canton along 
the Neretva where the capital of Herzegovina, Mostar, is 
situated. The first president is to be a Croat and the first 
prime minister a Muslim. In return, the Croats will get six of 
17 ministries. 
  As already mentioned, the Croats and Muslims have achieved 
this agreement, but they need to get back about 20 percent of 
the territory that is currently held by the Serbs. And, so far, 
the latter have not shown any inclination to give back conquered 
territory.

  [Text] Brcko, 11 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, told journalists in Brcko 
today that he cannot foresee an end to the war in the near 
future, although the Serb people want it. His statement came 
after the 40th session of the Srpska republic people's assembly, 
which adopted conclusions on topical issues of foreign and 
domestic policy. Members of the public were not present at the 
assembly's discussions. 
  "The latest attack by Muslim forces on Brcko rules out any 
possibility of their having any part of Brcko," Karadzic 
stressed. "Brcko has been and will remain a Serb town." 
  The Srpska republic president called on the people in Serb 
Posavina to be vigilant and strong and to remain in this 
territory "to defend it well and be convinced of their own 
victory." "There can be no discussion about the territory, 
which is vital for the Serb people," the Srpska republic 
president said. 
  In his statement for journalists, Karadzic reaffirmed the 
stands contained in the negotiating platform of the Srpska 
republic adopted in March this year, which is still in effect 
and according to which "no negotiations on the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina can be possible if there is no peace."

  [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb strongman 
Radovan Karadzic, after sharp warnings from Paris, said Thursday 
[12 May] he would find a way to free 11 French aid workers held 
by his troops for the past month for alleged arms smuggling. 
Karadzic was quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency as saying 
he had decided to "find a legal way" that would allow the 
release of the 11 French nationals employed by the Premiere 
Urgence (First Aid) group who have been held since April 8 in 
the outlying Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica. 
  (In London, European Union negotiator Lord Owen confirmed 
the 
aid workers would be freed "very soon." He told AFP he had 
received this assurance overnight from a trusted intermediary 
who was speaking on Karadzic's behalf. Owen said the Frenchmen 
would be freed "without condition and without trial.")

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] The coordinated attacks by the united aggressors 
have continued on the free Bihac territory last night and this 
morning. The chetniks have unselectively and sporadically 
shelled the defense lines on the Grabez front and the 
Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, and in the Buzim area, where they 
shelled villages. 
  Last night the outskirts of Cazin and Bihac were shelled. 
This is the fourth day that the traitors from Abdic's 
paramilitary have continued their savage attacks on the Cazin 
outskirts, on Todorovo, and parts of Buzim. 
  Last night, and particularly this morning, fierce artillery 
and infantry attacks have continued on the areas of (Pecigrad) 
and Todorovo. The local secessionists are constantly aided by 
the chetniks from the so-called Serbian autonomous region 
Krajina, and there are many murderous chetnik mercenaries [word 
indistinct] in their ranks. There have been many casualties in 
the shelling, and the material damage is considerable. 
  The civilian authorities in the district, the members of the 
5th Corps, and [word indistinct] from this region, in other 
words, all the citizens, have again appealed to the Kladusa 
people to resist these criminals in order to stop this war here 
and [words indistinct].

  [Text] At approximately 2000 the Muslims attacked Brcko 
again. Let us listen to what our correspondent Brane Bozic has 
just reported: 
  [Begin Bozic recording] To be precise, the suburbs of this 
town called Grcice were attacked. Several artillery shells, 
most probably of large caliber as their explosion could be heard 
very far away, landed there. The grenades were falling on 
residential homes and in the vicinity of an electrical current 
transformer which supplies this town with electricity. The town 
remained in darkness while the residents rushed into cellars. 
  Ambulance vehicles and the fire brigade sped toward Grcice. 
As of the time of this report, no further details are 
ascertainable. Nobody is on the streets except for the police, 
reporters, and the army. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] New York, May 12 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. Security 
Council on Wednesday evening condemned Bosnian Muslim attacks on 
Brcko, Serb town in the north of the ex-Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina where four people were killed and 13 wounded 
on Tuesday. The Security Council is concerned about the reports 
on the shelling of Brcko...[ellipses as received] by the Muslim 
government forces which resulted in civilian deaths, including 
those of women and children, reporters learned from Security 
Council President Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria after a 
consultative session. 
  Bosnian Muslim and Croat military commanders recently 
publically confirmed they are preparing an offensive on Brcko, 
Serb town in the northwestern part of the corridor which links 
the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS). 
  On Tuesday evening the Muslims shelled Brcko during a 
session 
of the RS parliament. The attack left four Serb civilians dead 
and 13 wounded. Only 24 hours later, the Muslims attacked 
again, but this time no-one was injured. RS officials described 
the attacks as the latest Muslim attempt to provoke a Serb 
military response and force fresh NATO air strikes against the 
Serbs. 
  Gambari also said that the Security Council is worried about 
the violation of the security measures in the region of Tuzla 
(Muslim-controlled city in northeast Bosnia) especially "the 
Serb shelling." 
  However, TANJUG learns that the Muslims launched artillery 
and infantry attacks on Serb positions near Tuzla on Wednesday, 
and U.N. representatives in Sarajevo confirmed that the Muslims 
have massed strong forces in the south and southwest of this 
city aiming to prevent the movements of U.N. military observers 
and to prepare military actions in the region. 
  According to the Nigerian diplomat, the Security Council 
called on the warring sides on Bosnia to fully cooperate with 
the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), to meet their obligations 
and to refrain from actions which could worsen the situation or 
threaten the peace process. 
  Gambari said that the Security Council session did not 
discuss in detail the modified French proposal on Brcko because 
the opinion prevailed that it is necessary to wait for the 
outcome of the meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, 
United States and the European Union scheduled to open in Geneva 
on Friday. 
  Russia insisted that the Security Council condemns the 
massing of the Muslim heavy arms and their offensive in Mt. 
Igman, which is close to the exclusion zone in Sarajevo, but 
Gambari failed to mention this.

  [Text] Brcko, 11 May (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces carried out 
a new artillery attack on Brcko this evening, almost at the same 
time as last night. All shells landed on the town's Grcica 
district. According to the first unofficial reports, five tank 
shells were fired from the direction of Vranovaca. There is not 
yet any reliable information about possible victims or the 
extent of the damage.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamid Deronjic from Brcko] </F>
  [Text] Last night on the Brcko front was marked by the 
Serb aggressor's provocative fire. The chetniks were firing 
with small arms along the entire front line, while on the 
central part of the front the aggressor also used grenades, 
portable rocket launchers, and Broving. Last night at 1935 from 
the direction of Cadjavac the enemy shelled the defense 
positions in Vranovaca, and at about 2000 the chetnik 
antiaircraft guns and machine guns fiercely pounded Boderiste. 
  Strong chetnik infantry forces are constantly on the move, 
searching for the best positions for offensive activities. Last 
night the enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups were the most 
active on the central part of the front, facing the positions of 
the 108th Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade in 
the region of Vranovaca and Boderiste. 
  The Serb aggressor is trying to forge an excuse for 
launching 
his long-planned offensive, now that the UN observers are in the 
temporarily occupied Brcko. The chetniks are currently trying 
to do this with their propaganda campaign concerning the alleged 
attacks by the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on 
civilian targets in Brcko. However, after the unfortunate 
episodes in Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde -- and after the transport 
of the chetnik tanks through the protected zone in Sarajevo, 
when one of the aggressor's tanks mysteriously disappeared -- 
the chetniks simply cannot be trusted with anything.

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 May (TANJUG) -- On the basis of the 
decision by Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees 
[UNHCR], employees of this organization will not be returning to 
the Srpska republic [RS], Koning Abuzaid, head of the UNHCR 
mission for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, said after today's visit 
to Brcko, the SRNA agency reports. 
  During a meeting today with Nikola Koljevic, RS vice 
president, and RS Health Minister Dragan Kalinic, Mrs. Abuzaid 
said this move was made because of a security threat to UNHCR 
personnel following the UN decision that Serb targets can be 
bombed without previous announcement. Humanitarian aid to the 
people in the Srpska republic will from now on be delivered via 
Belgrade, which is seen as technically more complicated.

<F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Serbs Brought `Mad-Max-Launching </F>
Pads,' Too"] 
  [Text] Intelligence monitoring performed by proficient UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] members confirms that the biggest 
battle since the beginning of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
be fought at Brcko. All parties to the conflict (led by Serbs) 
have brought large quantities of weapons to this area, so that 
the UN Security Council, the United States, and Russia have 
unanimously stated that a spark should not cause a fire, and a 
small fire should not develop into an uncontrolled blaze. 
  The establishment of a security zone around Brcko is most 
convenient for the Bosnian Serbs. In this way they will be 
given international guarantees needed for the creation of the 
Serbian corridor between Serbia, Semberija (Bijeljina), Brcko, 
Pelagicevo, and further to Banja Luka. It is not true that the 
corridor was invented because of the Serbs, or that its 
importance is exaggerated! If there were no corridor, the 
so-called Serbian republics in Bosnia and in Croatia really 
could not function normally. If we look at the territory 
presently controlled by the Bosnian Serbs, we can see that it 
looks like an oak leaf split in the middle -- two separate parts 
are kept together by a narrow strip of land (the area between 
Brcko and Orasje, which is the most sensitive part of the 
corridor). 
  Ratko Mladic has admitted himself that Muslims and Croats, 
who can "terminate" the corridor, have excellent weapons. The 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is extremely strong in that area 
because it has a direct communication with Tuzla and Zenica, 
from where it can be supplied. Apart from 40,000 regular 
soldiers, approximately the same number have been recruited from 
territorial defense units. Apart from light weapons and 
all-terrain vehicles, the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has a large 
number of guns and howitzers of Russian and Chinese origin, 
"Mi-8" helicopters flown by former Yugoslav People's Army pilots 
(carrying launching pads with missiles); they also have modern 
communications equipment, various types of antitank missiles, 
light antiaircraft launching pads, and so forth. 
<H5>  Problem With Soldiers </H5>
  Ratko Mladic openly admits that the largest Serbian problem 
is soldiers -- there are not enough soldiers, their number 
cannot approach the number of members in the Muslim forces (half 
of the Serbian brigades are filled with only 50 percent of 
soldiers, for example). The Croatian side in Bosanska Posavina 
[HVO units] has far fewer soldiers compared to both the Serbs 
and the Muslims, but they have excellent weapons. Apart from 
older models, the "T-54," "T-55," and "T-34," the HVO also has 
"M-84" tanks that can be compared to Serbian armored units. It 
has self-propelled 122-mm howitzers of the "Gvozdika" type (they 
were seized in the Varazdin Corps), and all types and calibers 
of guns, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. 
  The Serbs have brought to Brcko not only all known types of 
guns and missiles, but also new self-propelled "missile 
vehicles" assembled like in a "Mad Max" movie. Rails were added 
to adapted military transporters (on wheels) on which Russian 
air-to-air missiles of the type "AA-2 Atoll" are mounted (the 
Russian copy of the U.S. "Sidewinder AIM-9"), with which Serbian 
fighter planes ("MiG-21" and partially a "MiG-29") are armed. 
Since there are enough missiles in the Serbian air base near 
Banja Luka, which cannot be used because of the fly ban, 
necessary modifications were made at the "Vazduhoplovni zavod 
Kosmos" ["Kosmos" Air Force Institute] in Banja Luka so that a 
large number of vehicles are now equipped with two adapted 
missiles each. 
  "Atoll" has a half-round front and front wings, it weighs 70 
kg, it is 2.8 m long, its diameter is 120 mm and the distance 
between the back and front wings is 530 mm. Its red warhead 
carries 6 kg of highly destructive explosive. "Atoll's" range 
in air combat is 6.5 km (it has various types of infrared and 
semiactive radar control); the purpose of its ground version is 
to achieve a propaganda effect rather than its combat value. 
  It has to be admitted, however, that the Serbs do not throw 
anything useful away. Some types of air-to-ground missiles 
("Sparrow") are used even in the West in the modified 
ground-to-air version. The Serbs did the same thing as the 
United States did a long time ago (they adapted the "Sidewinder" 
into the light system ground-to-air "Chaparral," which is 
induced by heat sources). The "AA-2 Atoll" was transformed by 
the Serbs into a missile which should hit strong sources of heat 
radiation (various industrial facilities, tanks with running 
engines, and so forth), including helicopters flying at an 
altitude of several meters above the ground or flying in low 
flight. 
  It is obvious that the Serbs are trying to help themselves 
somehow. The UNPROFOR, on the other hand, needs a large number 
of high-quality tanks of the "Leopard" type in order to 
supervise all three warring factions around Brcko. With the 
present number of 20 tanks the UN is able to protect only a very 
small territory and their personal safety. 
  UNPROFOR intelligence professionals stress another thing, 
too: If the HVO joins the conflict on the Muslim side, the Serbs 
plan a revenge against "HVO logistics and supply bases" in 
Croatia with several additional multiple rocket launcher 
batteries of the type "M-7" and "Oganj" (caliber 128 mm, range 
21 km). Artillery attacks would be aimed at Slavonski Samac, 
Stitar, Zupanja, Bosnjaci, Podgajci Posavski, Rajevo Selo, and 
Gunja. The UNPROFOR headquarters is warning officials in charge 
that the time is passing, and tension around Brcko growing, 
since the Serbian corridor is like a steak offered on the table.

  [Text] Brcko, May 11 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic said on Wednesday the combined Croat-Moslem 
artillery attack on Serb-controlled Brcko in northeastern Bosnia 
on Tuesday had made the Serbs much more reluctant to make 
concessions in the future territorial delineation. "This once 
again proved us right in insisting that our corridors be 
sufficiently deep from the strategic point of view ... to make 
our borders easy to defend," Karadzic said early on Wednesday 
during a visit to the victims of the attack in Brcko hospital. 
"These civilians have paid dearly for their freedom and the 
right to hold political meetings in their town," he added. 
  During the attack, mounted at 7.30 p.m. local time (5.30 
p.m. 
GMT) on Tuesday, the Bosnian Serb parliament was in session in 
Brcko. 
  A statement issued by the hospital in Brcko said the attack 
left three people dead, including one child and one pregnant 
woman, and 13 others wounded. Bozo Isailovic, 61, his 
daughter-in-law Svetlana, 27, who was in advanced pregnancy, and 
her two-year daughter Bozana were killed at their home which 
sustained a direct hit from a tank shell. Two of the wounded are 
in intensive care, six with severe wounds are undergoing 
hospital treatment and five have been discharged after receiving 
medical help. 
  Karadzic told reporters that Bosnian Serbs had always 
granted 
passage through their territory to Croat and Moslem deputies. 
"Otherwise, their joint parliament would be unable to hold any 
sessions in Sarajevo." Bosnian parliament Speaker Momcilo 
Krajisnik, who visited the wounded together with Karadzic, said 
that what had happened last night in Brcko was the crime against 
the Serb people and an anticivilizational act.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 11 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Croats are 
on Wednesday using grenade launchers to shell the Moslem-held 
centre of Mostar, Moslem Sarajevo radio said citing Bosnian 
Moslem army sources. 
  The shells are falling close to the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) tent, the radio said. 
  Provocations and ceasefire violations are on the rise in 
Mostar, city in southeast Bosnia, despite the negotiations which 
started five days ago in Vienna between the Bosnian Moslems and 
Croats on their joint federation in this former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  Sarajevo radio said in a program, monitored in Belgrade, 
that 
Bosnian Croat snipers on Tuesday fired from the Mostar airport 
on the southern suburb of Gnojnice. 
  Bosnian Croat Army Chief-of-Staff General Milivoj Petkovic 
said in Mostar that a joint Moslem-Croat army command for 
Sarajevo will shortly be set up and that in time it would be 
transformed into a federal command of the joint Bosnian army. 
He added that the deadlines for this remain undefined so far 
because this issue is as delicate as is the defining of the 
borders of the cantons within the future Moslem-Croat federation. 
  Petkovic urged the forming of a joint, but not single 
federal 
army, the Croatian radio said. 
  Following year-long heavy fighting in central and southeast 
Bosnia, the Bosnian Croats and Moslems on March 18 succumbed to 
U.S. pressure in Washington and signed an agreement on setting 
up a federation in Bosnia and a subsequent confederation with 
the neighbouring ex-Yugoslav republic of Croatia. 
  Central Bosnia and the cities of Mostar and Stolac (both in 
southeast Bosnia) remain the stumbling block of the Vienna 
talks. Both sides claim they are entitled to these territories 
with a mixed population and neither show the least wish for a 
compromise.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- Croats expelled by the 
Muslims from Zenica, Muslim-held city in central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, are arriving each day in the region of the 
Lasva river valley, the Croatian radio reported on Thursday. The 
radio said that the wave of ethnic cleansing of Croats has 
gained in intensity especially after March 18 when the Bosnian 
Croats and Muslims submitted to U.S. pressure in Washington and 
signed an agreement on setting up a joint federation in Bosnia. 
Some 1,500 Croats from Zenica fled to Vitez, Busovaca, Novi 
Travnik and Nova Bila (all Croat-held towns in central Bosnia), 
the Croatian radio said. 
  The realization of the agreement on the Muslim-Croat 
federation has been slow although both sides, which met in 
Vienna this week, agreed the borders of the ethnic cantons 
within the future state and that its first president is a 
Bosnian Croat. Despite the agreement, Bosnian Muslim leader 
Alija Izetbegovic has said he would continue to head 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I will remain the president of the 
Presidency -- the only body which should symbolize the 
continuation of the state as a whole, Izetbegovic told Sarajevo 
television on Wednesday evening. He said that this should not 
present a problem in relations with the Croats because after six 
months a Muslim should become the head of the Muslim-Croat 
federation. 
  On Wednesday the Bosnian Croats and Muslims closed their 
five-day talks by reaching agreement on the ethnic division 
within the future federation, which will spread on 30 percent of 
Bosnian territory, by planning to extend their cantons at the 
expense of the Serb territories in this ex-Yugoslav republic. 
The two sides' plan for their federation to include 58 percent 
of Bosnia practically announced new offensive actions on 
territories currently controlled by the Bosnian Serbs. The 
Muslim-Croat offensives on Serb territories in Bosnia are 
already underway in northern and eastern Bosnia.

  [Text] The fact that the Serbian [word indistinct] will 
not easily give up their idealistic (?intentions) toward our 
country is shown by their recent accumulation of manpower and 
weapons in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo, as well as the 
entire zone covered by the 1st Corps of the Army of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today they continued bringing volunteers 
from Serbia and Montenegro and deploying them to positions held 
by local Serbian paramilitary units around Sarajevo. A vehicle 
full of the aggressor's soldiers has arrived in the Bosut 
Barracks and (?a bus full) of chetniks arrived in Vogosca from

  Truce violations around Sarajevo continue today also. 
Chetniks carry out provocations more and more frequently, but 
our fighters are not responding to them most of the time. The

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 12 (AFP) -- Fighting raged Thursday 
[12 May] between the mainly Moslem Bosnian army and Bosnian Serb 
troops about 40 kilomtres (25 miles) southeast of Tuzla, UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Eric Chaperon said. He 
said the fighting was concentrated along a strip running north 
and south that separates territory controlled by the two 
belligerants along the region of Sapna and the towns of Olovo 
and Brgule. 
  Chaperon said "30 detonations were reported in the region of 
Sapana Wednesday, 73 in Brgule and 11 in Olovo." He said 
farther north in Brcko, five shells fell in the region of 
Posavina around 1730 GMT Wednesday without claiming any 
casualties. Two of the shells hit the town's main power 
generator. 
  Chaperon added that the situation was also tense in the 
western enclave of Bihac where both sides were reported to be 
bringing in reinforcements. He said eight soldiers wearing 
civilian clothes had attempted to enter the UN-imposed exclusion 
zone around the eastern town of Gorazde Wednesday carrying light 
weapons and a machine gun hidden under a blanket but were 
stopped by UN soldiers and turned away. 
  In Sarajevo, the UNPROFOR said the "usual" ceasefire 
violations were continuing in the capital with small arms fire 
and a few detonations. Chaperon said that an UNPROFOR vehicle 
was targeted Wednesday afternoon at the Sarajevo airport. 
"Fifteen shots were reported," he said adding that there were 
no injuries. 
  The latest fighting came as foreign ministers from the 
United 
States, Russia and five European Union countries including 
Britain and France prepared to meet in Geneva Friday to try to 
revive the stalled Bosnian peace process.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- If their offensive on 
the Serb town of Brcko fails, the Bosnian Muslims are planning 
to cause an ecologic catastrophe by blowing up the chemical 
facilities in Tuzla (northern Bosnia), Belgrade POLITIKA said on 
Thursday. The Tuzla chemical works are similar to that in the 
Indian town of Bopal which caused the death of 2,500 people and 
seriously injured 150,000. 
  Tuzla is held by the Muslims who have over the past few days 
been massing major forces in the south and southwest of this 
city, also confirmed by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
spokesman in Sarajevo on Wednesday. 
  The Seventh Brigade of the Bosnian army, well-known for its 
fundamentalism and lightening-speed offensives, has been 
transferred to the Kladanj-Olovo region (south of Tuzla) in 
preparation of military actions in this region, REUTER said. 
  The threat of an `ecologic strike' from Tuzla could be a 
desperate measure since poisons cannot tell the difference 
between one's own army and civilians and those of the enemy, the 
Belgrade paper said. Another possibility is that NATO would 
fulfill Muslim expectations and help them if they are 
unsuccessful, as in the case of Gorazde. 
  The Muslims could blow up several tanks containing poison 
substances and, in keeping with the already proven scenario and 
with the support of the Western media, blame the Serbs and then 
ask for NATO's help, POLITIKA said. The threats by the Tuzla 
Muslims would cause the death of thousands of people and 
seriously hurt over hundreds of thousands. 
  Before the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia, Tuzla was a 
major center of the chemical industry which had stores amounting 
to about 1,300 tonnes of chlorine, 1,100 tonnes of ammonium, 60 
tonnes of sulfuric acid and 3 tonnes of phosgene. 
  The release of chlorine into the atmosphere would threaten 
life in an area ranging from 1.5km - 76 km, while the ammonium 
would affect an area from 1 km - 28 km depending on the weather, 
POLITIKA learned from Dusan Rajic, a contamination expert of the 
Yugoslav army's techinical institute in Belgrade. 
  The use of phosgene would affect only the centre of the city 
or the cite from where it was released. Those who are 
threatening to cause an ecologic catastrophe could use this 
element since, by sacrificing their own people, they would 
achieve their aims -- to force international military aid, Rajic 
said. 
  The Muslims have already applied this scenario of 
sacrificing 
their own people to turn the international public against the 
Serbs. Last year they caused the massacre in the Vase Miskina 
Street in Sarajevo, while this year they caused the death of 
innocent civilians at Sarajevo's Markale Market in the same way. 
  Both times the aim was achieved -- the international 
community reacted with lightning speed and blamed the Serbs. 
Subsequent reports by UNPROFOR representatives about who was 
really to blame had no effect.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 11 (TANJUG) -- Many casualties have 
been reported in Wednesday's heavy clashes in western 
Bosnia-Herzegovina between Moslem units loyal to the Moslem 
leadership in Sarajevo and that of the Autonomous Province of 
Western Bosnia (APZB), Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio reported. 
  The radio, controlled by the authorities loyal to Moslem 
leader Alija Izetbegovic, said that the APZB forces continued 
for a third day in a row their "savage attacks on the Cazin 
border regions, Todorovo and the area of Buzim." The radio 
reported major damage to civilian facilities. 
  The APZB was proclaimed in a referendum of the Moslem 
population in the region in September 1993 and local businessman 
and former Bosnian presidency member Fikret Abdic became its 
president. Abdic, a political opponent to Izetbegovic, has in 
the meantime concluded peace agreements with the Serb Republic, 
the state of the Bosnian Serbs.

  [Text] Bileca, May 12 (TANJUG) -- By proclaiming Gorazde, 
Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia, as a U.N. safe area, it seems 
that the Muslims have been given the green light to freely 
attack the Serbs who are not permitted to fire a single bullet 
in self-defence. 
  In keeping with an agreement with the U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR), the Serbs last month pulled out their infantry to 
three km from the centre of Gorazde, and their artillery to 20 
km away following the collapse of a Muslim offensive launched in 
March from this U.N.-designated safe area which should have been 
demilitarized in the spring of 1993. 
  After this, some 200 U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in this 
region. 
  The wounding of a Serb soldier last Tuesday near the village 
of Kolovarice (9 km southwest of Gorazde in the direction of 
Foca) is only an illustration of the Serbs' claims that UNPROFOR 
has no interest in them in this region. 
  The Serb soldier was wounded after the Muslim forces from 
the 
villages of Vranici and Stupe (on the left Muslim bank of the 
Drina river) opened strong fire on Serb positions on the right 
bank of Drina which separates the warring sides. 
  Since the arrival of the U.N. troops in the Gorazde region 
two weeks ago, the Muslims have countinually launched attacks 
and armed provocations on the Serbs. In the village of Kazlagici 
(3 km east of Gorazde) a Muslim sniper on April 25 shot dead 
Sasa Burovic, a Serb, from Cajnice. 
  Burovic was killed before the very eyes of the Ukraine U.N. 
troops. Eyewitnesses claim that he was shot close to a U.N. 
armoured vehicle while he was talking with the Ukrainian troops 
and discussing their deployment along the lines separating the 
Serb and Muslim forces. 
  Burovic's close proximity to the U.N. peacekeepers did not 
in 
the least affect the Muslims, nor were they afraid they would 
have to suffer any consequences for the attack. 
  Judging by UNPROFOR's subsequent conduct, the Muslim 
estimates were not wrong. Not only did their action pass 
unpunished, but the UNPROFOR command failed to inform the public 
about this in an attempt to dismiss and forget the incident. 
Clearly, this served as an additional impetus for the Muslims so 
that their troops continued penetrating the so-called 3-km 'blue 
zone' in Gorazde and firing at the Serbs over the heads of the 
U.N. troops. 
  It has been shown that the U.N. resolutions are not binding 
for the Muslims as they are shooting even at Serb civilians who 
trusted the U.N. guarantees and returned to their homesteads in 
the Drina river valley. At the same time, the UNPROFOR from 
Gorazde is daily informing the world public that some Serb 
police stationed in certain positions near the town are carrying 
guns with cut-off barrels. UNPROFOR is also increasingly voicing 
doubts that the Serbs have withdrawn all their artillery to 20 
km away from the centre of Gorazde, but is not giving proof for 
this. 
  UNPROFOR continues to employ double standards towards the 
warring sides in Bosnia, ignore the obligations stemming from 
the U.N. resolutions and fails to take any steps to disarm the 
Gorazde Muslims and demilitarize the town.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] After a brief lull, Karadzic's media have recently 
again launched an action of dismissing fear among its 
subordinates. They are primarily boasting of the powerful arms 
that they possess, claiming at the same time that the Muslims 
have nothing, and therefore, not a chance of resisting them. 
They illustrated all this with a reportage about the 2d Armored 
Brigade. They showed a self-propelled howitzer, a multiple 
rocket launcher, a self- propelled antiaircraft gun [words 
indistinct]. The engineer boasted that they have laid thousands 
of mines, a gift to their enemies, as he said. Then they showed 
parts of the 27th Motorized Brigade in Derventa. The commander 
boasted that the Brigade is motorized in the true sense of the 
word, equipped with the most modern hardware and arms. An 
inevitable question arises: Where has Karadzic got all this 
from when we know that the majority of the (?500,000) residents 
of the so-called Srpska republic are illiterate and that their 
industry is literally at a standstill while their economy is in 
tatters? Where did such modern arms, such a quantity of 
ammunition, spare parts, and fuel come from? Not even many of 
the more-developed countries can afford this. The answer is 
clear -- [words indistinct] from Serbia. 
  This is not all. Analyst Karlo Jeger, on the pages of Zagreb 
GLOBUS [words indistinct] the forces of the Serbian aggressor 
that attacked Gorazde. Of a total of five brigades, two had 
arrived from Serbia [words indistinct]. A special police 
battalion from Serbia and the units of the antiaircraft defense 
with the most modern rocket systems that Serbia possesses were 
also there. It is clear, therefore, that there will be no end 
to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the borders with Serbia 
and Montenegro are hermetically sealed. 
  Karadzic's Serbs would behave entirely differently had they 
known that the potential of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, 
[words indistinct] $200 billion, and the armed forces from 
Serbia and Montenegro are no longer behind them. Many of them 
would not fight a day longer, therefore, the West, if it wants 
to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, must [words indistinct] 
the Serbs behind the negotiating table. Participation at such 
talks must also be secured for those Serbs who stayed on the 
free territories or have abandoned the temporarily occupied 
territories. One must not forget that they represent 60 percent 
of the total number of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Serbs. Only in 
this way can a just solution for all be found, that is, by 
blocking the borders on the Drina and Sava Rivers and nothing 
more.

  [Text] At an expert meeting of the Association of Yugoslav 
Engineers and Technicians, held at the Technical Fair in 
Belgrade, Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the National Bank 
of Yugoslavia, stated that the country's taxation system will be 
radically changed by the middle of this year at the latest. He 
announced that the process of transformation of dinars into 
foreign currency in our financial institutions will be 
simplified very quickly. According to Professor Avramovic, the 
third phase of the program of economic stabilization, that is to 
say, the commencement of investments, could be expected in the 
fall. 
  Exclusively for this newscast, the governor of the National 
Bank of Yugoslavia also speaks about today's latest decisions of 
the Council of Governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Dusko Petrovic] Mr. Governor, 
today's session of the Council of the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia was brief and efficient. Several important decisions 
aimed at the revitalization of banks, the continued monitoring 
of the economy, and the preservation of the growth of economic 
activities, were passed. What were these decisions? 
  [Avramovic] We have reduced the mandatory reserve that the 
banks have with the National Bank by a third, which will add to 
the credit potential of the banks and thus alleviate or perhaps 
even eliminate the shortage of funds that the economy has been 
experiencing in its efforts to increase production. One of the 
members of the council, Mr. Perucic from Beobanka, today 
reiterated how acute this shortage of cash was precisely because 
of this lucky circumstance, that is, the increase in production. 
We hope that we will overcome this shortage with the measures 
that have been taken last week and this week. If need be, we 
shall proceed further in the coming week. 
  [Petrovic] Mr. Governor, please comment on the decision to 
form 10 coordinating groups for the recovery of the economy with 
the Serbian Government, whose initiator was Minister [without 
portfolio] Dragan Tomic? 
  [Avramovic] Well, this is an extraordinary initiative. We 
have been thinking about it, but not in terms of such 
concentrated and extensive efforts that he had undertaken. We 
expect all the best from it as the key to our future recovery 
lies in the reconstruction of our production systems and big 
companies. There could not have been a better initiative than 
the creation of these coordinating groups, which will take care 
of the reanimation of production, the marketing of products, 
further investments, and the resolution of all problems that 
some of our companies face. 
  [Petrovic] The Federal Government has recently released 
bonds with an 11 percent interest rate onto the financial 
market. You have assailed this measure as an attack on the 
program. 
  [Avramovic] Yes. You know, we managed to agree with the 
banks to keep the basic interest rate down to 9 percent so that 
the economy would be able to obtain relatively cheap credits, I 
mean, these are not cheap credits anyway. The situation was 
particularly critical in agriculture. Then it came as a 
surprise that the Federal Government had appeared on the market 
with bonds of the highest value -- as the state bonds always are 
-- and with such a high interest rate. However, I have heard 
that they have suspended further emissions now. I hope that we 
will resolve all this in a satisfactory manner. 
  [Petrovic] You were also resolute in your demands toward the 
Federal Government to release state commodities and corn as soon 
as possible. You have even said that the federal state will not 
get a single dinar in credits unless it does this. 
  [Avramovic] Directly or indirectly -- through the federal, 
republican, and local authorities -- the state has huge stocks. 
All this will be spoiled if it is not put on the market as soon 
as possible. The first consequence of this would be a drop in 
prices, the second consequence a replenishment of the budget, 
and the third consequence the making of an economic space for 
the forthcoming harvest, which will be very good, as it seems. 
  [Petrovic] Thank you very much. 
  [Avramovic] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] With the internationalization and placement of the 
corridor under UN supervision, which is also the basis of the 
Vance-Owen plan, the international community tried to sell the 
Serbs a pig in a poke, the president of the Democratic Party of 
Serbia, Vojislav Kostunica, said at the news conference. 
  The Serbs in Bosnia were forced to wage this war, not for a 
road, but for a state. Vladimir Nikolic reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Nikolic] According to Kostunica, the 
international encirclement is living a life of its own 
regardless of what is happening in Bosnia. There has never been 
more negotiations about peace and less actual peace. The 
international community is not in even in a position to decide 
on the makeup of a body that would discuss the situation in 
Bosnia, let alone about the issue of peace. 
  [Kostunica] The Muslims attacked Brcko. There were human 
casualties. The international community and its most powerful 
protagonists are not responding to this, probably because the 
Serbian reports about casualties are correct, while the Muslim 
reports about the casualties so far have, as a matter of rule, 
never been accurate, but exaggerated. 
  [Nikolic] At this moment, Brcko could be a means for getting 
a more favorable division of the territory to the advantage of 
the Muslim-Croatian federation, however, it can also be a goal 
per se, that is, to break the Serbian territory in half and fan 
the war, Kostunica believes. 
  President of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro Novak 
Kilibarda 
appeared as a guest at the news conference. In the name of this 
party, he put forward an opinion that if the corridor near Brcko 
is interrupted by force, Yugoslavia must become involved in the 
war, or must at least openly say so. Saying that there is no 
alternative, Vojislav Kostunica concurred with this opinion. 
  Regarding the affair with the Dafiment Bank, the position of 
the Democratic Party of Serbia is that SRPSKA REC has published 
a fabrication. The statements of the Serbian Renewal Movement 
were branded as an expression of the lack of political culture. 
Kostunica said that he will privately press charges against 
SRPSKA REC. [end recording]

Minister Pavle Bulatovic and his aides today spoke in Pristina 
with the governors of the Kosovo and Metohija districts and with 
representatives of the military authorities about issues 
relating to the implementation of the policy and system of 
defense in Kosovo and Metohija, the Federal Defense Ministry has 
announced. 
  All issues of relevance to the security system were 
comprehensively discussed. The governors stressed that there is 
very wide-ranging and successful cooperation between state 
authorities and units and command bodies of the Yugoslav Army. 
  Bulatovic said that the political, security, and economic

  The successful cooperation of civilian authorities and units 
of the Yugoslav Army and organs of the Interior Ministry is of 
extreme importance, because for the time being this is the only 
reliable way of keeping the peace in Kosovo and Metohija, the 
federal defense minister stressed.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Cvetkovska: "11 Enterprises Fully Privatized"] </F>
  [Text] The privatization in the state has formally 
started. Although not yet officially, Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has gotten its first 11 
state enterprises transferred to private ownership. These are 
mainly small and medium-sized enterprises which started the 
ownership transformation under the old federal laws (the law on 
state capital and the law on personal incomes from the time of 
Prime Minister Ante Markovic). Here are the names of the 
enterprises: Solun, Gevgelija; the copyright agency Tutun, 
Skopje; the Agricultural Combinat, Skopje; Metal, Skopje; 
Makmarket, Skopje; Skolit, Skopje; Gradinar, Skopje; Economic 
Press, Skopje, as well as two more cooperatives, one from Kicevo 
and the other from Skopje (which, according to nonofficial 
information, have been liquidated in the meantime). 
  These enterprises started privatization according to Ante 
Markovic's law, by buying up the enterprises through internal 
shares and making payments to the former Development Fund. 
  As the manager of the financial sector of the Privatization 
Agency Evgeni Zografski explained, although the privatized 
enterprises have not yet received an official report on the 
accomplished privatization, the ownership is known and the owner 
defined. On the other hand, at the time they started the 
ownership transformation (in 1990) they applied the legal 
procedures of that time, which means that their accountancy was 
calculated (as the laws required then). They were denied the 
discount allotted by the law on state capital and on the other 
capital subject to privatization, the shares were issued and 
bought with money paid to the former Development Fund (the 
purchase sale contract was done between the enterprise and the 
Fund), and later on they were registered as private enterprises. 
  Most of them were exposed to the control of the former 
Government Auditing Office in order to see whether the capital 
of the enterprise and the discount allotted to the buyers under 
the old laws were accurately calculated, and whether the taxes 
for the internal shares were paid in cash. 
  According to the agency there are some enterprises that have 
really given cash money for the shares, but there are also 
others which have just made accounting transactions by 
purchasing the shares according to Article 4 of the law on 
salaries (of that time). If they do not do it in a defined term, 
they will not be entitled to that part of the privatized 
capital. However, as Zografski says, that is not going to 
happen, because there is just a small amount of money to be 
paid, and they will certainly do it. Namely, since they are 
truly private companies (which means that the present law on 
limitation of salaries is not valid) the income they realize can 
be transferred to payments for the shares, thus the owners will 
definitely buy up the company. 
  As far as the values are concerned, the capital is 
calculated 
in the value of that time (the so-called accounting value of the 
company), valorized for the period that has passed after the 
issuing of the shares until the day the tax payments were made 
(today it is 290 times greater than it was in December 1990). 
According to the present Privatization Law that money must be 
paid in three months' time after the Government Auditing Office 
control. 
  These companies are still waiting for the reports on their 
privatization also because of some other unsettled formalities, 
as is the public disclosure of the former owners, which will 
remain in the competence of the agency until the 
Denationalization Law is enacted. 
  As we were informed by the Privatization Agency, the first 
100 privatized companies will be known in June (those that have 
started privatization under the old federal laws), and they are 
on the list of the 1,468 companies which entered the first phase 
of privatization under the new Macedonian law on transformation. 
  Besides these 11 enterprises, the mixed companies -- foreign 
Macedonian (from the former Yugoslav republics) will be the 
first in their turn, and they have until 28 June to decide about 
their transformation, like the contract organizations. There 
are some 50 to 100 companies of mixed capital -- foreign and 
domestic, which will be transformed immediately, because their 
owners are known. All they have to do is make previous 
agreements on transformation with the foreign owner and make 
their privatization legal. If they themselves do not do it 
before June, the Privatization Agency will have to do it, 
according to the law.

<F P=106> [Article by Democratic Party Chairman Pavol Hagyari: "The </F>
Democratic Party Wants To Overcome Artificial Barriers"] 
  [Text] Shortly after the last parliamentary elections we 
became witnesses to a process that constituted a denial of the 
existing natural arrangement of things as well as a denial of 
the trends and tendencies prevailing in Europe. At a time when 
the coexistence of Czechs and Slovaks could have finally, after 
decades of totalitarian government, reached its logical 
outcome--a democratic arrangement of relationships between the 
republics, but mostly among citizens--the coexistence came to an 
end. At a time when the importance of borders in all of Europe 
is diminishing and the integration of the countries of the 
European Union is progressing ever further, a new border was 
created along the Morava River. 
  A border, which no one needed. A border which, apart from a 
handful of ambitious politicians and an evident minority of 
nationalists, no one wanted. And despite the efforts of 
individuals on both sides, the separation continued to be more 
and more transformed into an alienation. Whereas elsewhere 
borders are being changed into purely formal lines, for us this 
border is becoming more and more of a barrier. An artificial and 
nonsensical barrier which no one wants anymore and no one needs 
and which no one is able to espouse. 
  On the contrary, more and more people are realizing the need 
to overcome this artificial barrier or, better still, not to 
permit it to grow to greater dimensions, as is unavoidably 
necessary. Simple citizens engaged in travel, people from the 
new near-border communities and regions, entrepreneurs, people 
with relationships to the culture of the second nation, 
television viewers and radio listeners, students, patients 
undergoing therapy in the health facilities of the other 
republic, people who live permanently on the territory of the 
other republic, mixed marriages, etc.... All of these people 
were not only surprised and saddened by the division of the 
common state, but are experiencing specific practical problems. 
  Even though we cannot now eliminate the very essence and 
main 
cause of these problems, we should at least try to effect the 
maximum mitigation of their consequences. Although many people 
speak of overcoming artificial barriers, only a few are sincere 
about it and even more rarely does someone actually do anything 
about it. I am not now speaking of citizens and their efforts 
and longings of small, but at the same time great attempts at 
maintaining the Czecho-Slovak relationship. I have in mind those 
who primarily brought the problem about--in other words, 
politicians. 
  Seeing the unhappy situation and the lack of interest in 
resolving it, the Democratic Party decided to act. In view of 
its traditions, its membership, its basic values, it is 
generally understandable that it is precisely this party as the 
first among the Slovak political forces, which has come out with 
a specific program of Czecho-Slovak cooperation, with specific 
proposals to effect rapprochement between the Czech Republic and 
the Slovak Republic. 
  We are proposing to effect an economic and social 
transformation, utilizing all of the experiences of the Czech 
Republic. We are proposing that membership in European 
integrational structures be coordinated, that new legislation be 
created, taking into account the legislation of the European 
Union, as well as that progress be made in the fight against 
international criminality. We desire for the republics to grant 
citizens equal political rights (with the exception of elections 
to parliament), an equal opportunity to study, equal medical 
care, and, in the case of permanent residents, even equal social 
security benefits, equal to those of the republic's own 
citizens. We want to make available to citizens of the Czech 
Republic who are longer-term residents in Slovakia the right to 
participate in community elections. We propose supporting joint 
cultural projects, the creation of a joint radio broadcast and a 
joint television program or, at least, joint news broadcasts, 
prepared by a joint news staff. 
  We are convinced that the alienation has now lasted 
sufficiently long and that the time has come for a reciprocal 
rapprochement. To that end, the Democratic Party is proposing a 
specific way. It will not be an easy road and one without 
problems. We shall not avoid being attacked and accused. But, 
even so, it is worth it. History cannot be fooled. The 
relationship between Czechs and Slovaks will never be a 
relationship such as exists between two adjoining nations. 
  The impulse for the division originated with the Slovak 
political representation. That is why the moves toward 
rapprochement should originate with the Slovak side; at least we 
should show good will. The best example of our interest in 
drawing closer to the Czech Republic would be the showing of 
appropriate respect for the day on which the first Czechoslovak 
Republic came into being and proclaiming 28 October a holiday 
for the Slovak Republic. If for no other reason than at least 
because it is our duty toward our history and particularly 
toward ourselves. Decent people become accustomed to fulfilling 
their duties. Even we shall prove that we belong among decent 
people. It will be of great significance for any future 
rapprochement.

  [Text] At its meeting yesterday, the Slovak Government 
discussed and noted the report on the social situation in 1993. 
The Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family provided us 
today with information on this material. Marta Cierna comments: 
  [Cierna] The members of the Moravcik Cabinet had the 
opportunity to acquaint themselves with the real social 
situation last year. The report says that there was a further 
decline in living standards in 1993. The worsening of living 
standards manifested itself mainly in the continuing increase in 
the cost of living, the reduction of the purchasing power of the 
population, and rising unemployment. 
  The introduction of the new tax system, changes in the VAT 
[value-added tax], and the devaluation of the currency also 
affected the social situation. Therefore, although the overall 
income of the population grew by 19 percent compared to 1992, 
its real value fell by 2.6 percent. The average nominal income 
was 5,310 korunas [Sk]; the average income of employees in the 
private sector was Sk42 more. The cost of living, however, grew 
much faster than incomes. 
  The social groups most affected were families with small 
children, large families, and pensioners. The number of 
families that asked municipal authorities for social 
benefits--for example, the food allowance--went up by as much as 
25 percent compared to 1992. The social situation affected 
families with one or both unemployed parents in particular. 
This was caused, apart from other things, by stricter 
conditions for the payment of social benefits to the unemployed. 
  Regional differences in the rate of unemployment became 
greater as unemployment grew. The number of long-term 
unemployed went up as well. With regard to pensioners: 
Although pensions went up twice in 1993, the first increase 
beginning 1 March was only 3 percent, and the second, from 1 
December, was 6 percent. The average pension was Sk2,367. 
Although the state spent Sk2.7 billion more on pensions in 1993 
than in 1992, pensioners' living standards declined 
significantly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Attorney General Bohumira Kopecna by Pavla </F>
Safrankova; place and date not given: "State Attorneys Will Be 
Appointed in May"] 
  [Excerpt] [Safrankova] What will you focus on in your 
post of attorney general? 
  [Kopecna] First of all, on finishing the proposal for the 
minister of justice on appointment of the state attorneys. They 
will be appointed to their posts according to the Law on the 
Office of State Attorney on 17, 19, and 23 May. I consider 
expert qualifications and integrity to be the most important 
criteria. At this time, approximately 900 attorneys who were 
transferred here from the former offices of the prosecutor work 
at the state attorney offices. As of 1 July, there will be 
approximately 100 fewer of them. Their number at the individual 
levels of the office of state attorney is defined by the 
Ministry of Justice and are derived from the number of judges. 
  [Safrankova] Do you have any other priorities? 
  [Kopecna] I will also concentrate on further developing 
cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior in the struggle 
against crime because, after all, criminal action is the focal 
point of the work of the office of state attorney. It takes part 
in a civil action only exceptionally as specified by law. This 
concerns, above all, selected sections of Family Law--denial of 
fatherhood according to Article 62 of the Family Law, for 
instance. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Milos Sklenka: "According to Dlouhy, </F>
Liberalization of World Trade Will Increase the Czech GDP by 1-2 
Percent Per Year"] 
  [Text] Today, the Czech Republic will sign the final 
accords of the Uruguay Round and an agreement regarding the WTO 
[World Trade Organization]; our government is rejecting the 
so-called social clause to the GATT agreement; the Czech 
minister engages in bilateral negotiations regarding the 
expansion of trade. 
  Yesterday, in a conversation involving Czech journalists at 
Marrakesh, Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister of industry and 
commerce, said: "The Czech Government sees the GATT agreement as 
a fundamental contribution to our economy and to our future 
economic growth, because expansion of the Czech economy will be 
dependent upon export to a considerable extent. For the Czech 
Republic [CR], which has comparative advantages from the 
standpoint of exports that cannot be ignored, the conclusions 
stemming from the Uruguay Round, which facilitate access to 
markets, will, among other things, restrict the opportunities of 
developing nations to attack us for dumping and to impose 
quantitative and other technical commercial obstacles on our 
exporters." 
  In his opinion, the advantages stemming from the worldwide 
liberalization of trade and which are contained in the Final Act 
of the Uruguay GATT Round, which the minister will sign for the 
CR today in this Moroccan town, will annually provide a 
supplement for our economic growth on the level of 1 to 2 
percent of the gross domestic product. 
  In his speech before participants from 125 countries at the 
GATT ministerial conference, which will bring to an end more 
than seven years of negotiations involved in the Uruguay Round 
at Marrakesh after four days of discussion and which deals with 
the liberalization of international commercial exchange, the 
minister expressed the CR's interest in becoming a full-fledged 
member of the newly established WTO, as of 1 January next year. 
  He further rejected the so-called social clause, which is an 
inseparable component of the WTO agreement. He explained that 
the introduction of minimum work standards in developing 
countries having cheap exports would exert an unfavorable 
influence, not only on their competitiveness in the world 
market, but can have a negative effect on employment even in the 
importing countries. 
  "Wages in less-developed countries will remain low as long 
as 
those countries remain poor and as long as there are surpluses 
of available manpower," he stressed. According to Dlouhy, the 
social clause could even restrict the investments made by 
supranational corporations in these regions of the world, 
because it is precisely the low wage costs that attract them to 
those areas. 
  In responding to a question by HOSPODARSKE NOVINY as to why 
the CR, which wishes to join the ranks of the developed 
countries as rapidly as possible, is resisting their proposal to 
connect commerce with the rights of free association of citizens 
in trade unions, the guaranteeing of collective bargaining, and 
the prevention of the exploitation of child labor, the minister 
responded that "the CR is opposed to having the new 
international institution become a place of discussion regarding 
social and labor rights of citizens." He stressed that, for this 
purpose, there are other forums which exist, such as, for 
example, the International Labor Organization (ILO). 
  As far as ecological protection issues are concerned, which 
also became part of the document, particularly at the request of 
the United States and France, Dlouhy noted that even those 
issues should not be discussed within the multilateral 
commercial organization, in the opinion of the Czech Government. 
  Yesterday, Minister Dlouhy also held a number of bilateral 
conversations in Marrakesh. He signed a new commercial agreement 
with Muorad Cherif, Moroccan minister of foreign trade and 
investment. The document, which replaces an old agreement dating 
back to the 1980's, adapts mutual trade between the Czech 
Republic and Morocco to conditions of the market economy and 
fully reflects the standards of GATT. 
  He negotiated regarding the possibilities for eliminating 
antidumping measures aimed at the importation of Czech electric 
motors with C. Kesman, Argentine deputy minister of foreign 
affairs. V. Dlouhy also met for discussions with C. Amorim, 
Brazilian minister of foreign affairs, Panitchpakdi, Italian 
deputy prime minister [as published], and S.B. Joedono, 
Indonesian minister of trade. At the request of the Latvian 
side, he also held discussions with O. Pavlovskis, Latvian 
minister of state for foreign trade. It is expected that today 
the Czech minister will hold discussions with Peter Magvas, 
Slovak minister of economics.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bohuslav Rychtarik, mayor of Straz pod </F>
Ralskem, by hp; place and date not given: "There Is Hope for the 
Ralsko Area"] 
  [Text] About 50 delegates from 16 countries 
throughout the world participated in an international conference 
on the conversion of the weapons industry and revitalization of 
former military areas, which took place at Straz pod Ralskem on 
29-31 March of this year. The conference was organized by the 
Energy Efficiency Committee of the United Nations and 
sponsorship over the conference was adopted by the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic. 
  "Mr. Frederic Romig, the secretary of the UN Energy 
Commission, assured me that the conference signifies hope for us 
and that the model solution for saving energy in Ceska Lipa 
Okres, a project which is designated as an energy-efficient 
demonstration zone in the region of Ceska Lipa, and on which we 
began working with Mr. Romig approximately 18 months ago, 
continues to be alive. Mr. Romig already has in hand the final 
signatures pertaining to the availability of financing and the 
first operations could be initiated by the end of this year," 
said Bohuslav Rychtarik, the mayor of Straz pod Ralskem, about 
the negotiations. 
  [hp] At the conference, you met with representatives of 
entrepreneurial circles and government organizations. What are 
their experiences in revitalizing former military regions? 
  [Rychtarik] They assured us that the basic condition for 
revitalizing military areas is privatization--without 
privatization, we cannot move from the spot. The Czech 
Government has already created the fundamental conditions. A 
budgetary organization has been established for the 
privatization of former military areas at Ralsko and Mlada. The 
organization is called PRIVUM and a part of the property owned 
by the former military area has already been transferred to the 
property holdings of Straz pod Ralskem. We have already 
negotiated with representatives of PRIVUM and we were very 
surprised about how much they were "in the picture" with regard 
to the Ralsko area. They are extremely forthcoming and are 
developing maximum efforts to see to it that the problems are 
finally solved rapidly. We agreed on a precise schedule under 
which the various individual facilities will be transferred to 
PRIVUM, we know who must do what by when in order for matters to 
move forward. 
  [hp] Did the negotiations with representatives of foreign 
firms bring any concrete results? 
  [Rychtarik] In establishing personal contacts, we realized 
that we are not the only ones who must deal with the 
revitalization of former military areas. The U.S. Government is 
releasing enormous financial resources toward the revitalization 
of former military areas. It can afford to do so, much as it can 
afford to finance retraining of individuals and provide some 
advantages to those who are beginning to operate in former 
military areas as entrepreneurs. The Czech Republic, as one of 
the countries of the former Eastern bloc, has progressed the 
furthest in the privatization of former military territories, 
something which was confirmed to us by representatives from 
Belarus as well as from Latvia, who are sincerely envious of us. 
  Revitalization of the Ralsko area was of great interest at 
the conference to the Greeks, but, so far, they have not come up 
with a specific offer. On the other hand, negotiations involving 
Americans look quite promising. Rolls-Royce representatives were 
not only representing the world renowned automobile factory at 
the conference -- one of the divisions of the company is 
oriented toward processing uranium and is focused on ecology. 
The Americans were interested in the program for discontinuation 
of the extraction of uranium ore. In the immediate future, a 
working group from Rolls-Royce is to negotiate the topic with 
Eng. J. Makovicka, the director of the DIAMO state enterprise at 
Straz pod Ralskem.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcela Doleckova: "Russian Partner Makes </F>
Delivery of Nuclear Fuel for Dukovany Conditional on Repayment 
of Debt"] 
  [Text] Skodaexport, which was buying Russian nuclear fuel 
for the Dukovany nuclear power station until last year, owes the 
Russian supplier $5.7 million for the 1992 deliveries. Albert 
Panushkin, chief engineer of the Mashinostroyitelniy zavod 
company, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that, following the bad 
experience with Skodaexport, the Russian fuel producer intends 
only to sign contracts directly with the Czech consumer--that 
is, CEZ [Czech Power Generating Works] company. However, no 
contract will be signed until the debt is settled. In spite of 
the glut on the world uranium market, Mashinostroyitelniy zavod 
is the only company in the world that produces nuclear fuel for 
reactors of the Russian type that are installed in Dukovany. 
Even though CEZ invited tenders for the supply of alternative 
fuel for Dukovany, responses to which have come not only from 
the present Russian supplier but also from a West European 
consortium and the U.S. Westinghouse company, the mere 
development of the production technology for fuel for the 
Dukovany Russian-type reactors would take two to three years. 
Any supplier but the Russian one is thus essentially out of the 
question until then. The new contract between CEZ and the 
Russian supplier concerns this year and the subsequent two 
years. Although it should have been signed in March, it has 
only been initialed thus far. According to Jaroslav Mil, CEZ's 
specialist for nuclear fuel issues, the Dukovany power station 
has enough fuel in stock to last one year. However, it has 
already starting tapping those reserves. 
  Vladimir Lima, Skodaexport's director of finance, admitted 
to 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that "there is some truth" to the Russian 
accusation. He admits, above all, that CEZ had actually paid 
Skodaexport for the purchase in Russia a long time ago. 
Vladimir Cima stresses, however, that Skodaexport is "in 
complex credit relations with Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka 
[Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB]" and suffers from a 
shortage of funds. Asked directly whether Skodaexport uses CEZ 
money to cover its other commitments, the director of finance 
replied in the affirmative. He stressed, nonetheless, that ways 
of settling the Russian claim are being sought intensively. In 
this context, both Cima and Jiri Brudnak, who heads the relevant 
trade division of Skodaexport, use the words "gradually, by 
means of deliveries of goods as well as bank transfers." Cima 
even uses the term "to mutually offset claims and liabilities," 
by which he means not only Skodaexport's claims and liabilities 
toward Mashinostroyitelniy zavod (or, respectively, 
Tekhsnabeksport, a trading company with a license to export 
nuclear fuel), but also toward other Russian companies. 
Overall, Skodaexport's claims in Russia exceed its liabilities. 
  Albert Panushkin told us in this contact that 
Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is 51 percent private (these shares 
are owned by its employees) and does not care about the 
liabilities of other Russian companies toward Skodaexport. 
Neither Panushkin nor Brudnak deny the existence of certain 
partial interests on the Russian side. It seems that the 
management of Mashinostroyitelniy zavod is interested in 
obtaining the company's remaining shares and that the management 
would be more accommodating if the Czech side tried to influence 
Moscow in this direction. The remaining shares of this sole 
supplier of fuel for the Dukovany nuclear power station, on 
which the Czech Republic depends for about 25 percent of its 
electricity production, are still owned by the Russian state.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Skalkova: "Signing the Ingolstadt Agreement </F>
Signals the Beginning of Construction of the Pipeline on the 
German Side"] 
  [Text] Oil could begin flowing into Bohemia from the 
West in the fall of 1995; the site of the tank farm will become 
the property of the Czech Republic. 
  The festive groundbreaking at the tank farm in the refinery 
at Vohburg in the suburbs of Ingolstadt, from where a 
170-km-long oil pipeline will start on the German side, 
yesterday signaled the actual first stage of work on the 
movement of oil from Germany to the Czech Republic. The 
groundbreaking immediately preceded the signing of a 
Bavarian-Czech agreement on the takeover and sharing of 
guarantees for so-called uninsurable damages, an agreement which 
was the culmination of virtually six months of work by experts 
on both sides to obtain the approval of the Bavarian parliament 
regarding the approach to the right-of-way through which the 
pipeline will pass. With a view to the interests of Bavarian 
landowners, the Munich Government is assuming guarantees for any 
damages that could occur, for example, as a consequence of 
natural catastrophes or because of the halting of pipeline 
operations. The Czech side would compensate such claims with an 
amount of 80 million German marks [DM], taken from resources of 
the National Property Fund which it deposited with the Czech 
National Bank. 
  For the Bavarian side, the agreement was initialed by 
Michael 
Schneider, chief of the Office of the Ministry of Economics and 
Transportation; for the Czech side, by Tomas Jezek, chairman of 
the National Property Fund, Jan Princ, first deputy chairman of 
the National Property Fund, and Karel Siedler, director general 
of the corporation for the construction operation of the 
pipeline from Ingolstadt, Mero CR, corporation. 
  Part of the signing also involved a proposal for a letter to 
be exchanged by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus with his Bavarian 
counterpart, Edmund Stoiber, according to which the Czech 
Republic would pledge to fulfill all its commitments, even after 
the possible demise of the National Property Fund or the Mero 
firm. 
  Radomir Sabela, Czech Republic deputy minister of industry 
and commerce, who also participated in the signing ceremony, 
call yesterday's action an important step toward the 
independence of the Czech petrochemical industry from Russian 
oil. According to the deputy minister, the Munich parliament 
should adopt a law on the pipeline construction and on the 
possibilities of temporary access to land parcels of property 
owners who were resisting the project, at the latest by 20 May. 
T. Jezek several times emphasized the forthcoming nature of the 
Bavarian side in that connection. 
  Together with representatives of Czech diplomatic circles in 
Bonn, Jezek expressed his conviction that the German side would 
issue the building permit to initiate construction of the 
pipeline portion in the fall. According to the view expressed by 
a high-ranking official of the Bavarian Ministry of Labor, 
Reinhard Schug, whose ministry grants such permits, Munich is 
not planning to take the step until November or December. Even 
so, the need not be a threat to the deadline for starting test 
operations of the pipeline, which the Czech side optimistically 
is counting on for September of next year. More realistically, 
operations could begin by the end of 1995. The tank farm site, 
construction of which began as of yesterday, thanks to the 
preliminary permit issued by the Bavarian Government, is located 
on 6.5 hectares of land which should soon become the property of 
the Czech Republic. It will even house a repumping station for 
oil fed in from Trieste.

  [Text] Ljubljana, May 11 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia warned 
Croatia that it will undertake measures to move around 1,000 
refugees out from its holiday resorts on the Adriatic coast near 
Novigrad where they are staying. The refugees, predominantly 
Croats from the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
refused to leave Slovenia, where they have been accommodated, by 
April 15, as was envisaged by a Slovenian-Croatian agreement on 
governmental level. In a note to Zagreb, Ljubljana demands that 
Slovenian ownership of the resorts and interstate agreements be 
respected. 
  Failing to specify the diplomatic measures it will resort 
to, 
Slovenia threatened that the refugees would be moved out, with 
the explanation that its future moves are politically and 
morally justified. 
  Slovenian-Croatian relations have in recent weeks again 
deteriorated, as can be seen from Ljubljana's cold response to 
President Tudjman's invitation to Slovenian President Milan 
Kucan to pay an official visit to Croatia. 
  Besides the problem of the resorts, i.e., ownership, 
Ljubljana and Zagreb have also failed to regulate a number of 
other important political and economic issues. The delimitation 
of the border on the Adriatic coast and the delivery of power 
from the Krsko nuclear power plant and the payment for it have 
also been reasons for dispute. The constant drop in the 
exchange of goods between these former Yugoslav republics is a 
consequence of these disputes.

  [Text] Washington -- Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle 
met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 
Washington late this afternoon. A brief news conference was held 
prior to the official talks in the State Department building, at 
which the U.S. secretary of state among other things said that 
Slovenia was an extremely successful country that was advancing 
fast. He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that 
Slovenia had joined the Partnership for Peace. When I asked him 
what was the U.S. stance toward the statements of some Italian 
politicians who have been voicing open territorial demands 
toward Slovenia and Croatia, the U.S. secretary of state said 
that he was not acquainted with such demands but in extremely 
categorical terms stated that the United States is opposed to 
change of borders and resolutely supports the territorial 
inviolability of Slovenia. 
  Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle after the talks said that 
they were very successful. They discussed political and economic 
cooperation, where certain problems exist, for example, the 
issue of debts of the Krsko nuclear plant that were approved by 
the U.S. export-import bank EXIM. The Slovene foreign minister 
also raised the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo for 
Slovenia. Although the United States would not agree to a 
unilateral lifting of this UN Security Council measure, there is 
a growing belief that the United States would consent to a 
partial lifting of this embargo, especially in nonmilitary 
spheres. As an example of this, Foreign Minister Peterle put 
forward the import of explosives used in the construction of the 
Slovene highways. 
  The U.S. secretary of state among other things also received 
an invitation to visit Slovenia. With this, Slovene Foreign 
Minister Peterle ended the talks in Washington.

Partnership began occupying the State Agency for Hard Coal in 
Katowice; the miners are waiting for the results of the talks 
that started between the miners' trade unions and the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade [MPiH] late in the afternoon . Before 
this, the ministry received information from the Office of State 
Protection that the Solidarity ["S"] delegation would be 
accompanied by a large group of miners, who were to arrive on 
several buses. For fear of occupation of the government's 
premises, the ministry placed barriers manned with policemen 
around the building. "S" arrived alone. After five hours, 
decisions were made concerning three out of the four demands of 
"S" upon which the miners determine the suspension of the 
strike. As this issue of the daily was being closed, 
discussions were under way on the main demand--compensation for 
lost remuneration for the period of the strike. 
  On Wednesday [11 May], the "S" National Committee [KK] will 
decide on the further course of the protest action of the trade 
union. In the KK Presidium, three options are becoming 
noticeable. 
  The strike action may be suspended, and it is also possible 
that it will be continued. The third possibility is the staging 
of a one-day nationwide strike following which we will suspend 
the protests, RZECZPOSPOLITA was told by KK Spokesman Piotr Zak. 
<H5>  Ministry Half Open </H5>
  It was agreed that next week the ministry will present the 
trade unions with the economic results of the coal partnerships. 
Afterward, the demand for the liquidation of wage disproportions 
among the individual hard-coal mines will be discussed. As was 
stated by Deputy Minister Herbert Gabrys, concluded were also 
"far-reaching agreements" concerning the annulment of the 
resolution blocking wage moves in the mines and the employment 
policy. According to "S," the resolution conditioned an increase 
in productivity. Agreement was reached concerning the 
introduction into the statute of the coal partnerships a 
provision, in line with which the managements of the 
partnerships will obligatorily consult with trade unions on all 
issues that, in line with the Law on Trade Unions and the Labor 
Code, can be dealt with by them. So far the partnerships have 
only been operating on the basis of the Commercial Code. 
Guarantees were to be given and a provision was to be made, 
whereby employers, as a party, will join the labor collective 
agreements (so far the parties concerned were the unions and 
MPiH). 
  Talks on compensation for the wages lost for the period of 
the strike continued late into the night. The miners condition 
the suspension of the strike on their results. Negotiations 
with the directors of the coal partnerships on the previous day 
did not yield any satisfactory results. According to "S," 
strikers might make up for the protest by "increasing their 
productivity." The government stated that such compensation 
would be a violation of regulations. Despite that, both parties 
were close to circumventing them and reaching an agreement, but, 
according to unofficial information, resistance was put up by 
the representatives of one of the partnerships that had already 
signed the protocol stating that the miners would not get any 
money for the period of the strike. However, if an agreement in 
this area were reached, the Trade Union of Miners in Poland was 
going to submit a demand concerning higher wages. 
  Of the "S" demands, seven were intact, including the one 
concerning the exclusion of any repressions toward the 
participants of the strike. 
  Apart from "S," participating in the talks were also 
employers and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Miners in 
Poland, "Cadre," and "S '80." Contrary to the fears of the 
MPiH, the "S" delegation came to Warsaw without buses full of 
miners. They were surprised to find barriers and policemen 
around the ministerial building. However, "S" did not deny that 
the miners would not come; it would be a joke rather than 
anything else. The buses went to the occupied agency to replace 
the miners of the Jastrzebie Coal Partnership with the employees 
of other partnerships. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Three Options of KK </H5>
  The option of continuing the "S" action is backed by the 
fact 
that other regions are declaring a strike alert. On Thursday, 
the Podkarpacie Region, among others, is supposed to go on 
strike, as well as the Cegielski Factory in Poznan. "Our 
protest has been going on for months now. Employees may feel 
tired already. The government adopted the tactics of ignoring 
the protests. It pretends that nothing is happening. 
Therefore, it is possible that a decision will be made 
suspending the strikes until September. Sooner or later, because 
of nonimplementation of our demands, there will be social 
unrest. Then the union will resume the protest," stated Zak. 
The union's spokesman also did not rule out the possibility 
that "S" may suspend the protest action only after a one-day 
nationwide strike and a several-thousand-people demonstration in 
Warsaw. 
  Zak also stated that most of the KK Presidium members 
believe 
that representatives of "S" should not participate in the work 
of the Trilateral Commission--"These talks will not yield 
anything, and the government may say that it is trying to 
implement demands." 
  Perhaps the Sixth National Congress of Delegates, scheduled 
for late June, will be put off until the end of August and the 
beginning of September. Zak explains that this is because the 
protest action has decelerated organizational work. According 
to other sources, "in the nearest months, the leadership of the 
union wants to work out a strategy for fighting with the present 
political configuration. Krzaklewski has often pointed out that 
this fight is planned for months and years. Such important 
decisions as those concerning a ruthless fight with the leftist 
configuration must be made by the congress, not by the KK." 
  "S" decided to sue the government in the International Labor 
Organization for violating convention No. 122. According to 
"S," it is not effectively combating unemployment. A similar 
complaint was filed by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement in 
1993; however, the union suspended it in January of this year.

  [Text] Warsaw, 11 May--According to Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak, the "strike atmosphere is dying out," which creates a 
good climate for direct talks and for resolving problems. 
  At a meeting with the regional press in Warsaw today, the 
prime minister stated that the government is anxious to preserve 
the basic principle of democracy so that all of the major 
partners-signatories to the enterprise pact would participate in 
talks. That is why the government is attaching importance to 
negotiations within the Tripartite Commission, Pawlak added. 
  Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of 
finance, said that the government will not pay for the strikes. 
Asked about their costs, he said they are "too great, 
inadmissible, and unacceptable from a social viewpoint" and 
that, if they were to continue, all of society would shoulder 
the burden. Then it would be difficult to return to the 
previous income tax rates, he added. 
  In Prime Minister Pawlak's view, in accordance with the law, 
compensatory pay for the strikes should be paid by trade unions. 
This has been the case in one of the collieries. "When 
decisions are made, responsibility for their consequences is 
needed," he said.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 12 May--During a news conference today 
in the Sejm building after a speech by Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski, Lech Walesa confirmed that he agrees with the policy 
line presented by the minister. 
  The president said that he has been working with Olechowski 
for some time, adding: "We have discussed those topics; however, 
we could discuss phrases." According to Walesa, Poland is not 
threatened by any attack at the moment. However, a lack of 
strategy, policy, and vision of the functioning of the states of 
Central and East Europe could be a threat. 
  The president said that he was not surprised by the 
Constitutional Tribunal's decision on the dismissal of Marek 
Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the National Radio and 
Television Broadcasting Council. He "knew what the law is like 
and who created it." Walesa said: "It was created by 
Markiewicz, who knew from me that he would be the chairman, and 
that is why the law is structured as it is." "However, I 
thought the courts would view whether everyone in the country is 
independent and self-governing, and if this really was a balance 
of power seen in a different way," Walesa added [sentence as 
received]. 
  In Walesa's opinion, this is not in agreement with the 
principle of balance, because everyone who has control of the 
press and television has most of the power, and "may even--as it 
happened--not broadcast what the president says." 
  The president said that he is convinced he had to recall 
Markiewicz because he wanted to stress that "there must not be 
absurd situations whereby a workman has no money for bread and 
someone else earns 90 million zlotys, thanks to their 
independence, and the Council is the cause of such financial 
contrasts." 
  The president expects from every chairmen of the council 
"harmony and cooperation." 
  Walesa declared himself in favor of wage control in the 
economy, but, as he said, he did not block the earlier law so 
that he could sign one that is as "weak" as the new one. "I 
wanted to force the government to work out ideas tested in the 
world. So far, I cannot see anything new in this law, and my 
aim has not been achieved," Walesa said. [passage omitted] 
  Asked if he would take up the role of mediator between the 
government and strikers, he said that, at the moment, "there is 
no need for the president to participate in what is happening." 
A proposal to mediate could be seen as the president "wanting 
to heat up the atmosphere" and "score points," said Walesa.

<F P=106> [Article by "(jap)": "CBOS; Europe, Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Almost every second Pole would like to wake up 
tomorrow in a united Europe--so suggests research conducted by 
the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS]. 
  In March 1994, integration with the European Union [EU] was 
backed by 70 percent (three years ago it was 80 percent). Jacek 
Syryusz-Wolski, a government expert on integration, says 
comfortingly that we are more pro-European than the 
Danish--members of the Union. Experts warn, however, that the 
EU's rating will drop unless the Common Market opens up to 
commodities from Poland. 
  Of the respondents, 40 percent believe that we should join 
the Union of Twelve right now. Every fourth respondent would 
prefer to wait five years. 
  At the same time, Poles seem to be forgetting about the EU: 
Right now, 80 percent know what it is, whereas a year ago 86 
percent knew. Only 17 percent of respondents knew about the 
Maastricht Treaty, which established the Union. More than half 
of all respondents were not able to answer this question. 
  Advocates of Poland's integration into the EU are private 
entrepreneurs, managers, and school and university students. 
Indifferent to the EU or negatively disposed to it are peasants, 
inhabitants of rural areas, elderly people, and people with 
elementary education. 
  The research was conducted in late March on a representative 
sample of 1,230 adult inhabitants of Poland.

<F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Lentowicz: "To Live an Officer's Life"] </F>
  [Text] The end of the stereotype that is expressed in the 
well-known saying "Not a diploma, but willingness will make you 
a good officer" is announced by Roman Harmoza, new head of the 
Cadres Department of the Ministry of National Defense [MON]. 
"Within four to six years, the number of officers will be 
considerably decreased (currently we have 43,500 officers, which 
is 49 percent of the cadres). We will again have the summit of 
the hierarchical pyramid, which will be different, more noble," 
declares the general. 
  According to the plans of the General Staff, at the end of 
this century half of the Polish Army should consist of 
professional soldiers. The most numerous group--over 40 
percent--among the "professionals" will be noncommissioned 
officers, who, as it is in the U.S. Army, for instance, will 
carry the main burden for the direct training of soldiers. 
  The officers (30 percent) will deal primarily with the 
martial arts: They will carry the burden of commanding; they 
will be on the staffs; they will leave the offices of military 
administration, doctor's offices, and entire large sections that 
are full of colonels today. Backup services in the Army will be 
headed at some time by civilian managerial cadres. 
  "I do not envision a sudden reduction of officers," stresses 
General Harmoza. "Every year the computer will tell me who has 
already done his stint in the Army and should leave. A few 
years ago, an officer who desperately wanted to leave the Army 
had to do almost impossible, often half-legal things in order to 
be able to go. Today it is enough if he simply puts in a 
written request." 
  In recent years, one has seen a growing longing for the 
prewar ethos based on the aura of "defender of the homeland," 
the feeling of one's own value, being different from other 
professional groups, sometimes contemptuously referred to as 
"civil bands," as well as observing the "gentleman's" code. The 
supporters of a fast restitution of this special tradition of 
the Second Republic cannot easily cope with the difficult 
reality. Very persistent is the 40-year-old hunchback, caused 
by the conscious creation of a plebeian army and the constant 
advertisement of the model of "an officer--a man from among the 
people." The deeply rooted opinions about the Army, which is 
servile toward the political elites, which is associated not 
only with the security of the state but also with that of the 
governing party, have resulted in an alienation of the officers. 
The depreciation of the once-knightly profession increased even 
further as a result of the imposition of martial law. 
Incidentally, quite interesting is the disproportion between 
social trust for the Army as an establishment (76 percent, 
according to the Center for Research on Public Opinion) and a 
mere 35-percent approval for the profession of the officer (data 
are from the end of last year). 
  The general says: "Now we intend to restore the balance, 
which was twisted in the past, in the sphere of customs. In the 
past, the removal of the borders between hierarchies served the 
purpose of compensating for meager salaries. The `new policy' 
in the Army will therefore mean, among other things, that, 
because of the respect for rank, noncommissioned officers will 
not be admitted to commissioned officers' messes and vice versa. 
The custom of meetings in small groups is reviving most visibly 
in small garrisons. "The situation would be better if not for 
the prices, which are still rather high for officers. However, 
it is good that the price of music has not gone up that high," 
Gen. Harmoza left this comforting news for the end.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Wieslaw Piatkowski, chairman of the </F>
Polish Peasant Party Supreme Executive Committee: "Market 
Economy--Yes, but With a Difference"] 
  [Text] There are two main questions at issue in the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] report and program-formulating campaign. 
The first is to sum up the work of our organizations during the 
period under review and to obtain their opinions concerning our 
program tasks. The second question entails the following 
objectives: to assess the extent to which our program was 
realized during the period under review (on both the global and 
local scale); to formulate recommendations concerning the 
realization of our program (also on the global and local scale), 
which could be linked to proposing suggestions for a review of 
individual points in the program. It is the second question 
that I propose to discuss here. 
  I believe that the best method to use will be the comparison 
method: We should compare our program with the tenets of the 
coalition agreement and then compare both these documents with 
the declarations of the coalition government and its actual 
policy. Of necessity, this should be done concisely, so the 
present publication does not pretend to be an exhaustive 
presentation of its subject. 
<H5>  Economic Revival and Struggle Against Unemployment </H5>
  Both the PSL program and the coalition agreement accept the 
general tenets of the market economy and stipulate the following 
goals: revival and consolidation of economic growth; increased 
competitiveness of the Polish economy; priority status for a 
campaign against unemployment; and, to quote, "a different 
approach (from our earlier policy) to the social welfare policy 
and a just distribution of the necessary hardships to be borne 
by different social and income groups in the course of the 
process of reforming the economy." The following principle has 
been formulated: "The social welfare policy will be treated not 
as an onerous appendage to the economy but as a precondition for 
its development." These tenets can be described as the overall 
objectives of the economic transformation. 
  The above aims are accompanied by stipulations whose 
realization will be of instrumental significance in achieving 
the overall objectives. The stipulations, which are also 
included in our program, are: to repair the condition of the 
public finance sector; to develop an industry policy; to 
selectively protect the domestic market; to stimulate investment 
and export initiatives (with the help of investment allowances 
and credits); to reduce enterprises' debts; to accord equal 
treatment to the private and public sectors of the economy; to 
enforce financial obligations toward the state (by refusing to 
tolerate the so-called gray zone); and to work out a "strategy 
for economic growth and development." 
  These shared ideas of our own program and the coalition 
agreement have found reflection in the economic policy pursued 
by the coalition government. This is shown by the 1994 state 
budget. After all, its characteristic features are: orientation 
in favor of the development of production, investment projects, 
and exports, with the associated investment concessions; tax 
concessions linked to the creation of new jobs in regions 
threatened with particularly high unemployment; the more than 
threefold increase of the upper limit of State Treasury credit 
guarantees; the threefold increase of funds allocated for the 
promotion of exports; increased funds for industrial 
restructuring (concentrated mainly in the coal- and 
sulfur-extraction sectors); increased funds allocated for 
additional financing of interest liabilities on preferential 
credits to agriculture; the halting of the decrease in 
expenditure earmarked for the budget-funded sector; an increase 
of the lowest disability and old-age pensions; increased 
expenditure on social welfare assistance schemes; development of 
new forms of active antiunemployment measures, including 
emergency and public works. 
<H5>  The Guiding Principle </H5>
  All of this should be made common knowledge among delegates 
to report congresses. Therefore, the above questions should be 
presented by competent specialists who are thoroughly conversant 
with the PSL program and ideological principles, the contents of 
all coalition agreements, the Sejm acts, and government policy. 
They should be able to demonstrate that government policy is 
subordinate to the specific leading concepts ensuing from our 
program and from the coalition agreements. However, this by no 
means implies that we should suspend our possible criticism of 
that policy. 
  On the other hand, it is necessary to contest the view that 
the PSL allegedly promised a very rapid improvement in the 
population's material circumstances if it won an election 
victory and participation in the government. The PSL maintained 
consistently that all that could possibly be achieved on a 
short-term basis would be a rationalization of the economy that 
would not create a sufficient foundation for any significant 
improvement of the working people's situation, and that such 
chances would have to wait until a long-term economic program 
was first worked out and then put into practice. The same 
position is held by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the 
coalition. 
<H5>  Our Attitude Toward the SLD and the Coalition </H5>
  Discussion of these topics entails the question of our 
fundamental position regarding the SLD, including the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP]. This should be defined 
by two factors: the PSL's attitude toward the doctrine of 
social democracy, which is expressed in our Ideological 
Declaration, and the requirement that we cooperate with the 
social democrats in the interest of keeping a center-left 
government. 
  Let me recall that our Ideological Declaration states 
clearly 
the following: "The ideology of the Polish Peasant Party 
endorses selected aspects of the doctrines of social democracy 
and democratic socialism. This is because the policy of 
agrarianism is characterized by a similar sensitivity to 
questions of social justice and exploitation, political and 
economic democracy, public self-government structures, the forms 
and functions of ownership, and the socialization of the 
economic management processes." It follows from this that our 
potential criticism of the SLD cannot be construed as arising 
from the fact that the latter adopts a social democratic--or, in 
this context, leftist--orientation. It follows further that our 
possible criticism of that formation would be more justified if 
it were seen to betray the ideals of social democracy than if it 
actually cultivated these ideals. There are, in fact, some 
grounds for asking whether the SdRP is, on certain occasions, 
true to the social democratic doctrine. 
  It is worth recalling that, in the light of its Ideological 
Declaration, the PSL is a center-left group. It follows from 
this that any potential right-oriented sympathies on our 
members' part would be incompatible with the PSL's ideological 
principles. 
  The requirement of cooperation with the social democrats in 
the interest of maintaining a center-left oriented government is 
quite obvious. In such a coalition, the PSL is able to preserve 
its ideological identity. A coalition with right-oriented 
groups would result in a significant curtailment of the 
realization of our program and could even lead to a denial of 
the PSL's ideological identity. 
  Where there are any differences of opinion between the PSL 
and the SdRP, it is necessary to apply every effort of will to 
overcome these differences. I believe that this is always 
possible on the basis of a rational (as opposed to emotional) 
set of arguments. The rationality of the arguments should rest 
on the ideological principles of both groups. 
  As regards progress in implementing our program, it is also 
worth noting certain associated restrictions formulated in the 
coalition agreement. 
  The agreement contains the following statement: "As for our 
predecessors, we differ from them not so much in our formulation 
of the general economic objectives as in the methods, tactics, 
and means we recommend for their realization." 
  It could, of course, be said that the coalition intends to 
create a market economy just as the former Solidarity-derived 
governments did. However, the particular models of that economy 
vary in each case, and this should reflect the fundamental 
difference between the aims adopted by the Solidarity 
governments (which were right-oriented) and the center-left 
governments. 
  This very difference in the respective governments' aims 
should find its expression on the plane of forging economic 
relations--that is, so-called ownership relations--and 
distribution relations specific for the coalition. On the first 
point, there is no full consensus between the PSL and the SLD, 
so we should strive to work out an agreement in this matter as 
soon as possible. Here we must be guided by the idea of mixed 
ownership, which stands in direct contrast to the absolute value 
placed on the capitalist concept of ownership. 
  The question of relations of distribution requires a deeper 
treatment. The coalition agreement states: "The state must 
seek to alleviate the sharp contrasts between the incomes of 
various social groups inherent in the essence of the market 
economy, and, in particular, it must counteract the spread of 
areas of destitution in our society." Our objective here is not 
solely to alleviate the differences in peoples' incomes. A 
center-left government should by definition be guided by the 
principle of significantly reducing the imbalance in the 
distribution of national income; it should also seek to exert 
influence on the very model of the relations of distribution in 
the spirit of social justice. 
<H5>  Learning and Labor Before Capital </H5>
  In his 29 December 1993 Sejm address, the prime minister 
said, among other things: "It is necessary to restore balance 
in Poland so that learning and labor take precedence over 
capital.... It is our duty in a civilized country to ensure 
prosperity for society as a whole, and not just for select 
elements of society, even if the latter demonstrate the utmost 
economic activity." I believe that this is precisely the spirit 
that should influence the shaping of government policy. 
  I should like to recommend that we base the long-term 
strategic government program on the fundamental principles of 
agrarianism (and, by the same token, on John Paul II's social 
teaching, on which we draw in our Ideological Declaration). 
  This question should also be accorded particular attention 
at 
the PSL's future report congresses.
