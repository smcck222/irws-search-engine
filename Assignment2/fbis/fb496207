  [Text] We have just received a report from the Croatian 
Assembly Secretariat that Stipe Mesic, president of the Chamber 
of Representatives, has decided to postpone the 18th session of 
the Chamber of Representatives, which was scheduled for tomorrow 
morning. In his brief statement Mesic says that his decision is 
motivated by the fact that at today's session of the House of 
Counties, Deputy Premier Vladimir Seks said that the government 
agrees with the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] proposal to 
withdraw draft legislation items on the proposed agenda of the 
House of Counties from the current procedure. Since this 
proposal also includes some legislation which should be first 
discussed by the House of Counties [words indistinct] he will 
call the next session of the Chamber of Representatives in 
writing.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Interparty Agreement Possible"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- At the invitation of Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman, a meeting of the presidents of the parliamentary 
parties and the presidents of the independent clubs of deputies 
was held on Monday to discuss a proposal of the Croatian 
Democratic Community [HDZ] regarding the need for the election 
of new chairmen of the Sabor chambers, bearing in mind that 
Stipe Mesic and Josip Manolic had left the majority party (HDZ) 
and formed their own party of the Croatian Independent Democrats 
(HND). They discussed the need for changes in the parliamentary 
commissions in light of the newly emerged party breakdown of the 
Sabor, the bureau of the president of the Republic has reported. 
The only person not to turn up at the meeting was HND President 
Stipe Mesic. 
  The representatives of the parties agreed on the need to 
resolve the highlighted problems in a democratic manner, in 
observation of the rules of the statute and the rules of 
procedure, and if possible, with an interparty agreement. It 
was, thus, agreed to continue the consultations, is stated at 
the end of a statement by the bureau of the president.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksa Crnjakovic on a news conference by Stipe </F>
Mesic and Josip Manolic with foreign and domestic correspondants 
preceding the Assembly session in Zagreb on 17 May: "The HND 
Proposes That the Discussion on the Replacement of Assembly 
Figures Be Postponed"] 
  [Excerpts] Claiming at the very beginning that the 
upcoming assembly session would be a routine one, despite the 
desire for creating an illusion of the Parliament activities 
being obstructed, Chamber of Representatives President Stipe 
Mesic and House of Counties President Josip Manolic answered 
many open questions at the news conference held just before the 
assembly session. There is great interest in the upcoming 
session, as the most topical issues, from relieving Josipa 
Manolic of his duties and appointing a new president of the 
House of Counties, to the alleged demand for the resignation of 
Defense Minister Gojko Susak and Minister of Culture Vesna 
Jurkic Girardi, are on the agenda. 
  President Manolic reminded him that the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] wanted to relieve him of his duties as 
president of the Chamber of Counties very quickly. He also 
reminded of the reasons for founding the HND [Croatian 
Independent Democrats], stating that was what changed the 
political balance of powers in the Assembly and the political 
scene in Croatia. Manolic claims that the opposition was thus 
strengthened as a whole, which was the main goal. The 
unsuccessful attempt at replacing him started the parliamentary 
crisis, said Manolic. A resolution can occur either through an 
agreement of all those involved in the crisis, or by holding 
preterm elections, which would not suit anybody. 
  "We have managed to carry out a differentiation process both 
within and outside the assembly, we have strengthened the 
position of the entire opposition, and partly managed to break 
the monopoly of one party and one man. We want the party that 
has had the monopoly until now to continue the differentiation 
process. We accept the challenge. We want to form our own club 
and to be entitled to the same rights in conducting talks." 
  Manolic also told the reporters that the HND had proposed to 
the HDZ that the item relating to replacing the presidents of 
the two parliament chambers be taken off the agenda so that any 
possibility of obstructing the activities of the parliament and 
the expensive marathon-like sessions are avoided. The HND 
further proposed to put the item on the agenda in 15 to 20 days, 
but only after the agreement of all the parties on the 
redistribution of all the important positions is reached. 
Manolic predicted that there would be "pulling and pushing" 
about this issue if the HDZ does not accept the proposal. 
<H5>  Seks' Threats </H5>
  In the introductory part of the news conference, Manolic 
repeated his statement that certain representatives were 
pressured and seriously threatened. He quoted the words of 
Vladimir Seks, spoken in Vinkovci: "Croatia does not have 
capital punishment, but we will take Manolic and Mesic's heads 
off." " Why are there threats and on whose behalf? The times 
of a one-party state are behind us, and the time of real 
parliamentary decision making is ahead of us. We will defend 
the autonomy of the assembly," said Manolic. He mentioned the 
non-democratic behavior during the forming of the State 
Tribunal, explained why some opposition representatives have 
been asking that discussions of topical issues, such as the 
resignations of Gojko Susak and Vesna Girardi Jurkic, and the 
teachers' strike, be held at the Assembly. "The Assembly can 
not neglect these problems," remarked Manolic. 
  He has asked that issues that were up until now untouchable, 
covered by the veil of "military secrets," be discussed at the 
assembly. 
  The questions of the reporters then followed. 
  [Zeljko Peratovic] Did you attend the party meeting at the 
Presidential Palace in the morning? 
  [Mesic] I was invited, but I did not know who it was that 
invited me, so I did not go. I had a short meeting with leaders 
of some opposition parties at the Assembly, and agreed with them 
that we had to discuss the new balance of powers after we 
founded the Club of the HND. I did not go to the meeting -- I 
did not want to go before it was determined what Deputy 
President Seks said, why he openly threatened us. Such 
vocabulary becomes a traveling circus. 
<H5>  "What Resignation?!" </H5>
  [VJESNIK] Why did you write a letter to U.S. congressmen, 
claiming that the Washington agreement is not being implemented, 
when the Vienna agreement had already been signed at that time? 
  [Mesic] The time we sent the letter does not match the time 
of the signing of the Vienna agreement. We sent the letter to 
point out that the arms embargo must be lifted, so that the 
people can defend themselves. We also pointed out that there 
were forces that want to prevent the implementation of the 
Washington agreement. 
  [VJESNIK] Which forces are preventing the implementation of 
the Washington agreement; did you discuss that with Mr. 
Galbraith? 
  [Manolic] At the time we sent the letter, a discussion had 
started in the U.S. Congress regarding the lifting of the arms 
embargo, which was during the time of the fiercest attacks on 
Gorazde, when the international forces were not capable of 
protecting the Muslims. We also asked that the embargo on 
Croatia be lifted, because that is the only way we can defend 
ourselves from the Serb agressor. President Tudjman said at a 
certain point that he opposed the lifting of the embargo, and he 
has not taken it back, although circumstances have changed. 
  [Dijana Rexhepi] When do you expect that a peaceful 
reintegration of the UNPA's [UN Protection Areas] will take 
place? 
  [Mesic] We want rule-of-law in Croatia, in which authorities 
are divided into three parts, in which European standards are 
applied, and in which every citizen will have guarantees that 
they will be protected. 
  [Sead Saracevic] You claim that the HND is the second most 
powerful party in Croatia. How would you account for that? 
  [Manolic] We are the number two parliamentary opposition 
party; 10 representatives have gone over to us. They claim that 
we have a stud of Trojan horses. They are not a stud; they are 
representatives who have names. 
  [Mesic] I would say they are thoroughbreads. 
  [Dejan Jovic] What positions in the Assembly would you 
demand for the HND? Which parties attended the meeting? 
  [Mesic] There is a new reality in the Assembly. Now we have 
to sit down and talk, but without previous conditions. We will 
not accept ultimatums. We want partnership, fair talks, and a 
gentlemen-like agreement. We talked to Savka Dabcevic-Kucar 
[president of the Croatian National Party, HNS], Drazen Budisa 
[president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, HSLS], Djapic 
[leader of the Croatian Rights Party, HSP], Ivica Racan 
[president of the Party of Democratic Changes, SDP], and a HSS 
[Croatian Peasants Party] representative also attended, while 
some were not able to attend. We will meet for a discussion 
again, after the talks in the Presidential Palace are over. 
<H5>  The World Is Breaking Over Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  [REUTER] What does your criticism of the government relate 
to? 
  [Mesic] We have not criticized the government; the 
government has worked within the provided framework, and we 
support it. Our criticism relates to state politics, the 
policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. The HDZ has 
responded to two historical challenges: getting out of the 
Communist-Bolshevist surroundings, and founding a state. Now 
the question arises what kind of Croatia we want. We want 
rule-of-law, in which everyone will be doing their job within 
the framework of the Constitution and the laws. We have 
encountered obstacles there. President Tudjman said that 
rule-of-law would function only when all the territories are 
liberated, and we think that rule-of-law can function in the 
liberated parts. When it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we 
believe it should remain within its borders, and that the world 
should not violate the principle of inviolability of borders, as 
if this is done, the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina could 
be annexed to Serbia and it could pull the occupied parts of 
Croatia along. At the time we were inferior in weapons, we 
opened the front with the Muslims too, although we had a common 
aggressor. The results of this policy are evident: tens of 
thousands killed and exiled, houses destroyed. 
  [Ingrid Badurina] What is your interpretation of the 
disunion in relation to the percentages of the territory that is 
supposed to belong to the Muslim-Croat Federation? In Vienna 
there was talk about 58 percent, while in Geneva 51 percent was 
being mentioned. 
  [Mesic] The international community must take efficient 
action that would make the third side realize what reality is, 
that is not allow that borders be changed through aggression. 
  [Manolic] The world is breaking over Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
this is why this illogicality. However, that still does not 
mean that the Serbs will not find a place for themselves in the 
Federation. 
  [Olga Ramljak] You support legality, but you do not want the 
vote of no confidence to take place, although, in accordance 
with the procedure, the issue was put on the agenda. Why is 
that? Moreover, you have addressed the U.S. Congress, while you 
reproached others for doing so. 
  [Mesic] We have the right to address the international 
public if the Croatian people are in danger, and the arms 
embargo is disadvantageous to the Croat people. We are against 
measures being taken against Manolic only because he expressed 
his opinion. President Tudjman announced there would be 
proceedings before the Court of Honor because Manolic did not 
take back what he said, but while we were in the meeting, there 
was a phone call saying signatures were being collected. 
Manolic should have been given the chance to defend himself 
before the Court of Honor. It is to these methods that we 
object. 
  [Manolic] We have put the issue of the relieving the 
president of the Chamber of Counties on the agenda, but at the 
session we will propose that it be taken off the agenda if the 
proposer -- the Club of the HDZ -- accepts it. If it is not 
accepted, the session will be conducted according to the agenda. 
As far as the accusations, the "traitors addressing the world" 
are concerned, we have not accused Croatia, but the policy that 
has isolated Croatia from the rest of the world, led it into 
social unrest, and almost destroyed it. 
<H5>  "Kuna -- a Concession to the Herzegovinian Lobby" </H5>
  [REUTER] How much influence does the Herzegovinian lobby 
have on Croatian politics, and who is against the Washington 
agreement? 
  [Manolic] It is a large lobby. The Vienna agreement has 
provided answers to Gojko Susak's war aims. However, what is 
left of them? Tens of thousands of dead and exiled. None of 
these war aims have been achieved. We know in advance who will 
oppose the Vienna agreement: the same people who started the 
war against the Muslims. 
  [Jasmina Kuzmanovic] Allegedly, the decision was made that 
the kuna be introduced in Herzeg-Bosna too. Is that correct? 
  [Manolic] The kuna is a minor issue, although it is 
interesting that within one year the Law on the Croatian Bank 
Note has been changed twice. The decision on the kuna was made 
at the time of the greatest conflicts with the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus being a concession to the Herzegovinian 
lobby. 
  [Mesic] There is no mention of Herzeg-Bosna in the 
Washington agreement, and therefore there is no mention of the 
kuna being introduced either. That would not have been support 
to the implementation of the Washington agreement. 
  [Unidentified foreign correspondent] Will you disclose the 
names of the representatives who have become members of the HND? 
  [Mesic] Yes.

  [Text] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic at Zagreb 
airport this afternoon. President Izetbegovic is on a stopover 
in Zagreb on his way to Saudi Arabia where he will be taking 
part in the pilgrimage to Mecca with 400 other Muslims from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. We discussed the implementation 
of the Vienna agreement, President Tudjman's visit to Sarajevo 
-- which is expected to take place very soon -- as well as 
various forms of cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia, such as transport, trade and the power industry, 
President Izetbegovic said after the talks. 
  Minister Granic said that there were no longer any obstacles 
in the way of President Tudjman's visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
He added that the exact date of the visit would be determined 
in a couple of days. Minister Granic said that the talks also 
centered on cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia 
in the area of trade, as well as a joint approach to European 
integration, the system of security and succession. As far as 
the Washington and Vienna agreements are concerned, both sides 
have agreed that their implementation should be ensured as soon 
as possible, Minister Granic said.

  [Excerpts] Since 14 May, Peter Weiss, first deputy chairman 
of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [and chairman of 
the Party of the Democratic Left, PDL] and Milan Ftacnik, [PDL] 
deputy of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, have been 
on a working visit to the U.S. capital. In an interview granted 
to our Washington correspondent Peter Susko, they assessed their 
agenda of yesterday, which was their first full working day, and 
the results of talks they had with U.S. representatives. 
  [Begin recording] [Weiss] We met Senator Claiborne Pell, 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, who has great 
affinity for Slovakia. After the liberation, he was the first 
U.S. consul to Slovakia. He has a reputation of being both a 
defender and an advocate of Slovak interests. [passage omitted] 
Pell's interest centered first and foremost on the position of 
minorities and on their representation in the Slovak parliament. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Ftacnik] The fact that Senator Pell received our delegation 
testifies to the importance the U.S. side attaches to our 
working trip to the United States of America. Of the other 
meetings we have had, I would like to mention the meeting with 
Department of State representatives in charge of the Slovak 
Republic and our discussion with experts on Central and East 
Europe on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has transpired that 
the representatives of the U.S. Administration realize the role 
the Party of the Democratic Left is playing and could be playing 
in Slovak politics even after the early parliamentary elections. 
That is why they showed interest in our policies and positions 
on the key issues of Slovak domestic and foreign policy. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Vegh: "Appreciation for the Slovak Unit"] </F>
  [Text] Daruvar/Lipik--During the second day of the visit 
to Croatia by Slovak Defense Minister P. Kanis and Army 
Commander J. Humaj, our delegation met with L. Kolencik, 
commander of the Slovak engineering battalion in the former 
Yugoslavia, at its base in Daruvar, approximately 120 km east of 
Zagreb. 
  Colonel Kolencik briefed the delegation on the battalion's 
situation and on the work it has done and will do in the very 
near future. He said that our unit has an important position 
within the UN peacekeeping forces in view of its activities, 
which consist mainly of constructing and repairing roads and 
bridges as well as disarming mines. To date, Slovak engineers 
have built eight new bridges, and, in the Lipik district and 
Sarajevo, they have checked for mines over almost 30,000 square 
meters of terrain, have completely repaired 96 km of roads, and 
have built more than 30 watchtowers. In this context, he asked 
Minister Kanis to expand the military hardware to include 
several STRALOM-type tanks, which will make it easier to remove 
mines. Kolencik also emphasized that, in the future, it will be 
necessary to tighten up the criteria for selecting the command 
corps for UN missions. The Slovak ambassador to Croatia, M. 
Kucera, asked the military delegation to make available at least 
one helicopter to the Slovak contingent's command in the former 
Yugoslavia to allow for greater flexibility in supervising the 
individual groups in this large area. The delegation was also 
in Lipik, where the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supreme 
commander, General Bertrand de La Presle, on the occasion of the 
first anniversary of the Slovak engineering battalion's 
deployment in this part of Europe, presented a UN commemorative 
medal to its 144 members for their involvement in the peace 
mission. A further 210 members of the unit were awarded a 
ribbon, second class. B. de La Presle highlighted the high 
morale of the battalion, which a year ago was given the honor of 
participating alongside another 30 armies in resolving the 
Balkans conflict and thus entered into the consciousness of the 
world community. He also added that this is one of the best 
units that has served under his command. The commemoration, 
which, apart from the UNPROFOR supreme commander, was also 
attended by the commanders of other UN units, continued with a 
parade of military hardware and a gala reception.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Maria </F>
Hluchanova; place and date not given: "Talks on Economic 
Cooperation Will Dominate"] 
  [Excerpts] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik will depart 
for an official visit to the French Republic tomorrow. In this 
context, we asked him for an interview. [passage omitted] 
  [Hluchanova] What attitude will you adopt, on behalf of 
Slovakia, toward the stability pact, and how will you justify it? 
  [Moravcik] I have been informed about the results of expert 
talks on this issue that were held in Athens on 10-11 May 1994. 
At these talks, we succeeded in pushing through our standpoint, 
which has opened the path for Slovakia's active participation 
[in the conference on the stability pact to be held in Paris in 
late May]. The only question that remains open is that of the 
modalities of this participation. Regarding the voices that the 
stability pact may lead to a new Munich or a new Vienna 
Arbitrage [in November 1938, by which southern Slovakia was 
ceded to Hungary], I would like to stress that this is 
completely out of the question because one of the conditions I 
have laid down is that the principle of the inviolability and 
unchangeability of borders be fully respected and included in 
the document. This implies an advantageous starting point for 
further negotiations on our part. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "jac": "Nelson Mandela Accepted Michal Kovac's </F>
Invitation to Visit the Slovak Republic"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--President Michal Kovac and his wife 
yesterday returned from a three-day visit to the Republic of 
South Africa [RSA], where he attended the inauguration of new 
RSA President Nelson Mandela, at the invitation of the National 
Inauguration Committee. "We have seen a country with deeply 
rooted hatred and a wide gap between whites and blacks undergo 
significant democratic changes, especially recently, which a few 
days ago culminated in free multiracial elections," the 
president said, adding that the Slovak Republic considered it 
very important to participate in this event in order to confirm 
that we not only continue to be interested in cooperating with 
the RSA, but also want to start a new stage in mutual relations. 
The improvement of economic relations was also the aim of 
Michal Kovac's meeting with the governor of the South African 
central bank, who is expected to visit Slovakia in the very near 
future. Because Michal Kovac also met with Nelson Mandela, 
reporters inquired about the contents of their conversation. 
"Even though the conversation with Mr. Mandela was short, it was 
two or three times longer than his meetings with other 
delegations." Kovac conveyed to the president his thanks for 
his lifelong quest for the rights of blacks and for seeking a 
peaceful path toward solving this problem. "At the same time, I 
made use of the meeting to invite the president to visit the 
Slovak Republic. Mandela accepted the invitation; the date of 
the visit will be specified later. I personally believe that 
the visit might take place next year."

<F P=106> [Article by "bor": "Slovakia's Orientation Toward European </F>
Structures Confirmed"] 
  [Text] "The orientation that we keep stressing and our 
ambition to make headway in political, security, and economic 
integration processes have been confirmed," Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Eduard Kukan said after a meeting of the Western 
European Union [WEU] Consultative Forum, where the Slovak 
Republic was granted the status of associate partner. As of 9 
May, we can participate in meetings of the WEU Council and in 
the work of working groups, maintain contacts with the WEU 
"planning cell," and participate in various peacekeeping 
operations and in the evacuation of the population from 
endangered areas. On the other hand, the status of associate 
partner does not offer the chance to use the WEU's collective 
protection or the right to veto its decisions or vote on its 
supreme representatives. 
  Defense Minister Pavol Kanis drew attention to the fact that 
the WEU was the third international institution in the security 
sphere in which we participate in one way or another. So far, 
we have been most active within the framework of UN peacekeeping 
forces, where a Slovak engineering battalion successfully 
operates. In this context, Kanis "bemoaned" the Army's budget, 
which does not allow us to make sufficient use of all of the 
opportunities provided by such cooperation, not to mention the 
fact that a further cut in this budget is currently being 
contemplated. 
  An interesting view was expressed by Minister Kukan when he 
was asked to explain the fact that last week U.S. political 
scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski again "forgot," in one of his 
articles, to include Slovakia among candidates for NATO 
admission among the Visegrad Four states. According to Kukan, 
all politicians who committed this "mistake" assured him in 
personal conversations that this would not happen again. He 
said that he was unable to explain Brzezinski's repeated 
"errors" but could not resist adding that "his views and 
political analyses do not carry all that much weight in the 
United States today."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by </F>
Antonia Vymazalova; place and date not given: "Bilingual Names 
According to a List"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Vymazalova] Which name of the 
community in the minority language will it be possible to use 
[under the law on the use of bilingual signs in regions with 
ethnically mixed populations]? 
  [Pittner] The names of communities in the language of the 
minority are set down in a list that constitutes a separate 
supplement to the government-sponsored bill. This list includes 
the official name of the community--that is, its name in the 
Slovak language--and its designation in the language of the 
ethnic minority. Under the law, it will only be possible to use 
names that are on this list. This applies to the Hungarian as 
well as the Ukrainian and Ruthenian minorities. Those names 
have been studied by experts from the fields of history, 
geography, linguistics, and other disciplines, whom we assembled 
at the Ministry of the Interior. The names had first been 
discussed with all of the partners in the coalition. 
  [Vymazalova] Does the government recommend in its own bill 
the incorporation of some ideas from the deputies' bill on 
bilingual signs, which it turned down? 
  [Pittner] Not at all, because the deputies' bill only 
repeats the previous government's proposal of November 1993, 
under which the name of the community was to be translated into 
the language of the minority or transcribed according to its 
rules of orthography. The translated or transcribed names are 
not identical to the names used--for example, by Hungarian 
fellow citizens when referring to their community in their own 
language. The names of communities as they evolved in the 
entire historical period until the early 19th century and as 
they are recorded in Jan Lipsky's work Repertorium of 
1808 were used as a point of departure. The names on the list 
are names that have taken shape in the course of historical 
development and that are used by the local population. 
  [Vymazalova] You said at a news conference that the law 
would apply to about 560 names of towns and villages and that 
the signs ought to be financed by the state. A sum of 
approximately 6.6 million korunas is to be set aside for this 
purpose. Who will make and install those signs? 
  [Pittner] This is the responsibility of the district road 
administrations. This obligation arises from the law on the 
designation of communities, and there is a decree that 
stipulates where exactly at the community's entry and exit the 
signs must be installed. The name of the community in the 
language of the ethnic minority will be placed on the 
appropriate traffic sign. 
  [Vymazalova] What impact will this law have on citizens' 
everyday lives? Can the second name be used in the address, for 
example? 
  [Pittner] No. Only the name in the Slovak language is the 
official name. The second name is only for the designation of 
the community in the mother tongue of the ethnic minority.

  [Text] No secret agreement whatsoever exists between the 
coalition government and the Hungarian parliamentary parties in 
Slovakia. This was stated at a press briefing of the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] by Pal Csaky today. 
  Speaking about the forthcoming parliamentary elections, he 
said that the MKDH supported the notion that the Hungarian 
political forces in Slovakia ought to have a joint stand, but he 
did not agree with the idea of establishing a joint party. The 
MKDH wishes to study the proposal of a union worked out by 
Coexistence, but, for the time being, it is supporting the idea 
of creating a tripartite coalition between MKDH-Coexistence and 
the Hungarian Civic Party. 
  Csaky also said that, after the elections, his party will 
support any government that, on the basis of democratic 
principles, continues on the course Slovakia has entered on.

<F P=106> [Article by "(mh)": "The Democratic Union: We Reject the </F>
Opposition's Attempt To Discredit Parliament"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In connection with the merger process, 
it is impossible to specify the exact number of members of the 
Democratic Union of Slovakia (DU), said DU First Deputy Chairman 
M. Knazko, following the party's Republican Council session on 7 
May. He explained that DU has representatives throughout 
Slovakia, apart from in four districts. "I am convinced that we 
will not struggle to enter the parliament," he added in 
connection with the prognosis for electoral preferences. He 
rejected the possibility of discussing open lists of candidates 
in the case of DU; nevertheless, he did admit to negotiations on 
a preelection coalition, but not until after the publication of 
the June public opinion poll. The DU Republican Council 
endorsed J. Kosta as the head of its election team. He is a 
sociologist and an external adviser to the prime minister. 
  In their resolution, the members of the Republican Council 
expressed their distaste at the attempts by the current 
opposition to discredit the parliament by vulgarizing their 
parliamentary appearances. The attempts to scandalize 
government members are nothing other than a well-thought-out 
tactic aimed at deliberately detracting attention from the 
parliament's routine work and, subsequently, at destabilizing 
the situation in the National Council of the Slovak Republic, 
states the resolution. 
  DU Deputy Chairman V. Vaskovic said that, at the moment, 
there is no specific view about the amount of property that 
should be included in the second wave of privatization. 
According to him, it is important to reach an agreement on the 
philosophy of the privatization process; however, in no way 
should the volume of coupon privatization decline below 
one-third of the overall volume of privatized property. 
  In connection with the withdrawal of the trade unionists 
from 
the General Agreement, DU Deputy Chairman R. Kovac described as 
crucial the fact that social conciliation has not been 
endangered. He discounted the possibility that the trade 
unionists will increase the pressure on the government, for 
example, by strike action because they realize that such a 
course would not resolve the issue. The DU Republican Council 
approved a change in the party's logo from the original DEUS to 
the new DU. Kovac justified the change by revealing the 
reservations expressed by linguists and heraldists.

Realistic"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--"Only the offer of the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH] is realistic for the Standing 
Conference of the Civic Institute [SKOI] because it was the 
first such offer and because it came from circles closest to 
us," [SKOI spokesman] Jan Langos told a news conference 
yesterday. He added that an agreement exists between the KDH 
and SKOI that the KDH would not interfere with the selection and 
placement of SKOI candidates on the slates of candidates. 
However, SKOI's candidates will be placed after the KDH's own 
candidates who stand a realistic chance of being elected. The 
KDH Council is ready to recognize the right of SKOI members to 
their own club of deputies in the parliament, Langos said, and 
estimated that the joint ticket might gain the support of 10-15 
percent of voters. Regarding possible differences of opinion 
between the KDH and SKOI, Langos said that these are not 
important at present and that the KDH's offer does not entail 
any obligation for disciplined voting [by SKOI candidates] in 
the future. According to Langos, all parties to whom the KDH 
offer has been addressed must decide autonomously. He warned, 
however, that it is urgent that they make their decision soon.

  [Text] Bratislava--Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic, presented letters of 
appointment to new members of the Slovak Television Council in 
Bratislava yesterday. On this occasion, he mentioned their 
responsibility under the law to check on the quality of 
television broadcasts. He stressed that this would be one of 
the council's crucial tasks in the preelection period and voiced 
the conviction that, in its new composition, the council would 
build on the positive results of its predecessor. The letters 
of appointment were taken over by Peter Kollar, Stanislava 
Benicka, Kornel Foldvari, Terezia Salayova, Kristian Bezak, and 
Jozef Prusak, who became chairman of the Slovak Television 
Council. Jozef Prusak told TA SR that the reconstructed 
council, whose other two members are Eva Kristinova and Dusan 
Jariabek, wants to become thoroughly conversant with materials 
being prepared for the parliament, as well as with documents 
pertaining to the operation of Slovak Television. This applies, 
in particular, to the television statutes and to the code of 
ethics of employees of this public corporation that is to be 
drafted.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 14 May on 
page 4 carries an 800-word interview with legal expert Ernest 
Valko, former chairman of the CSFR Constitutional Court, by Jana 
Pankovcinova, entitled "After 20 January 1994, the Slovak 
Information Service [SIS] Is No Longer Entitled To Issue 
Screening Certificates." In the interview, the place and date 
of which are not given, Valko argues that, after 20 January 
1994, the SIS is no longer entitled to issue screening 
certificates and that any screening certificates issued after 
that date are illegal. As the interviewer observes, the 
continued issue of screening certificates by the SIS was 
admitted by SIS Director Vladimir Mitro in an interview 
published in the 12 May issue of the Bratislava daily NOVY CAS. 
  Valko explains that, on 20 April 1993, the Meciar government 
authorized the SIS to issue screening certificates; the validity 
of the then government resolution was limited to nine months, 
however, so this authorization expired on 20 January 1994. The 
expert asserts that there is currently no body in Slovakia that 
is entitled to carry out screening and that any certificates 
issued by the SIS after 20 January 1994 are "invalid." He even 
contends that those who received a positive screening 
certificate after that date can sue the SIS "because the SIS did 
not have the right to issue those certificates, and it was its 
responsibility to let it be known that it no longer has this 
authority."

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F>
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Oliver Vujovic in Skopje; 
date not given: "`A Balkans War Always Was the Basis for a 
World Conflict'"] 
  [Text] [Vujovic] What is the balance sheet of your 
country's three years of existence since 1991? 
  [Gligorov] We achieved our independence by peaceful and 
legitimate means: by the referendum, a new constitution, and 
democratic elections. This independence has fulfilled the 
national dreams of entire generations. Our people fought for 
this for 150 years. But we live in a region where there is a 
war going on that led to UN sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro, and we have had an embargo imposed on us by Greece. 
These two things make it difficult for the Macedonian economy 
to develop. Our major connecting routes for people, goods, and 
capital have been interrupted. Our future lies in association 
with the European Union. 
  [Vujovic] Balkans experts fear that the conflict might 
spread to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. 
  [Gligorov] As long as there is a war in our region, there is 
obviously some threat. The Kosovo problem is also a danger to 
us. That is why we have called upon the United Nations to send 
us observers for preventive reasons. It has since emerged just 
how correct this measure was. But I would also like to point 
out that we are conducting a clear-cut policy: good relations 
with all our neighbors. Thanks to this policy we have hardly 
any problems with Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia. We even 
have very good economic and cultural relations with Bulgaria and 
Albania. We used to have very good economic relations with the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which we are trying to maintain 
under the embargo today. Everything will certainly be back to 
normal once the war has ended and the sanctions have been lifted. 
  [Vujovic] Recent signals coming from Serbia are not all that 
encouraging. President Slobodan Milosevic's policy is very 
pro-Greek. Many Serbian politicians consider Macedonia to be 
part of Serbia. Is that a real danger or are these just verbal 
threats? 
  [Gligorov] Yes, there are such threats. The independent 
state of Macedonia is a reality in spite of the Greek embargo. 
I am sure that a Balkans war would break out if Serbia or 
another neighbor tried to enforce their claims. And a Balkans 
war was always the beginning of a world conflict. That is why 
it is also in our neighbors' interests to renounce such historic 
burdens. 
  [Vujovic] Greek-Macedonian relations are the biggest problem 
today. 
  [Gligorov] There is no objective reason why there should be 
conflicts between Greeks and Macedonians. There are no 
territorial claims. Cooperation is in both countries' interest. 
None of the things going on between Greece and Macedonia are in 
the interests of our states. It is all just a matter of 
emotions, which unfortunately play a great role in the Balkans. 
  [Vujovic] There have been speculations lately about 
Macedonia wanting to change its flag and coat of arms. Is that 
right? 
  [Gligorov] That is just gossip. But we are determined to 
discuss all the questions with Greece and to find solutions that 
are acceptable to both sides. We will talk this over in the 
next few days. 
  [Vujovic] Many observers believe that the United States is 
using Macedonia as a base in that part of the Balkans. What is 
the role that the United States plays in Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] There are no U.S. bases here; these are mere 
speculations. We asked the United Nations to send peacekeeping 
troops to Macedonia for preventive reasons. That was a good 
move. Even UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has called 
Macedonia a good example, a model that the United Nations should 
use in the future. Preventive measures always achieve much 
better results than war does. At the beginning there were only 
Scandinavian UN troops stationed in Macedonia, but, today, about 
half the contingent are U.S. troops, the other half are 
Scandinavians. That is it, the Americans are here only as part 
of the UN peacekeeping contingent, not as U.S. Army. 
  [Vujovic] The Macedonian Parliament has given the go-ahead 
for NATO membership. Why? 
  [Gligorov] It is not easy for a small country to survive 
today without being part of a collective security system. The 
United Nations is certainly the most important organization. 
But it does not have a military structure of its own, its 
possibilities are limited. NATO is the only collective security 
system that is still in existence. The Partnership for Peace 
offer is a real possibility for all those seeking protection 
today. Our parliament's resolution is to be seen as a statement 
of general orientation. Joining the Partnership for Peace would 
be a first step for us that could be realized as soon as we are 
a member of the CSCE. 
  [Vujovic] Is Greece the only country preventing Macedonia 
from joining the CSCE? 
  [Gligorov] Yes, it is. 
  [Vujovic] What is your view of Austria-Macedonia relations? 
  [Gligorov] We have a tradition of good relations and good 
economic cooperation with Austria. Austria supported our UN 
membership. But Austria is still cautious in establishing full 
diplomatic relations; we are still waiting for an Austrian 
ambassador to come to Macedonia.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime 
minister, who is holding contacts in Skopje, the capital of The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], has held a joint 
news conference with FYROM Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski. 
  Speaking at the news conference, Karayalcin said that the 
relations between the socialists and the social democrats in the 
Balkan countries are very important, adding that these relations 
will, at the same time, contribute to regional peace. Pointing 
to the importance of historic ties of friendship with Macedonia, 
Karayalcin said that there are many Macedonians in Turkey and 
that they are engaged in successful work. Noting that during 
his contacts in the FYROM developments in the Balkan region and 
existing areas of cooperation were discussed, Karayalcin added 
that Turkey will send corn to the FYROM. He recalled that a 
$25,000 [as heard] loan agreement through Eximbank was signed 
between the two countries, adding that this loan will be 
extended in September or October. 
  Crvenkovski, also speaking at the news conference, gave 
details on his meetings with Karayalcin. He stressed that an 
agreement has been reached on the continuation of the existing 
relations. Crvenkovski added that his country received a lot of 
support from Turkey during its difficult periods. 
  Karayalcin attended a dinner in his honor hosted by 
Crvenkovski this evening. He also visited the Turkish Embassy 
in Skopje. He will return to Turkey tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report on a communique from the Ministry of Interior of The </F>
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: "The Explosion Was Caused 
by an M-75 Hand Grenade"] 
  [Text] On 26 April 1994, at approximately 0315, an 
explosion was caused by explosive material placed in an Opel car 
belonging to Boze Neshkovski, which was parked in front of a 
building on Oktomvrinska Revolucija Street in Kumanovo. This 
caused a fire which spread to a Reno-4 GTL and several other 
cars parked in the same area, the Interior Ministry report says. 
  According to the ministry's statement, after visits to the 
site by the examining magistrate of the Kumanovo communal court, 
the public prosecutor, and a team of experts from the Macedonian 
Interior Ministry and the director of internal affairs in 
Kumanovo, it was determined that the explosion was the result of 
the activization of explosive material and that it was a matter 
of a defensive-offensive M-75 hand grenade, known as a 
"Kashikara." 
  The report goes on to say that two cars were completely 
destroyed by the explosion while eight others were damaged. The 
material damage amounted to more than 250 million dinars. 
  The Ministry of Interior is taking intensive and 
comprehensive measures to discover the perpetrators and to shed 
light on this case, the communique concludes.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 17 (TANJUG) -- The implementation of 
the programme of economic stabilization in the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia proceeds well, which is indicated by an industrial 
production rise, reasonably good supply on the market and 
complete stability of the national currency, the dinar. 
  This was concluded at Monday's meeting of Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic and the prime ministers of the republics 
of Serbia And montenegro Mirko Mjrjanovic and Milo Djukanovic 
respectively and Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia 
Dragoslav Avramovic, the Federal Ministry of Information said. 
Industrial output in Yugoslavia has been on a steady rise since 
the beginning of the year and in April it was 3.4 percent higher 
than in March. The Yugoslav currency was on May 13 included in 
the foreign exchange rates quotation of the daily U.S.A. TODAY 
among some 30 strongest currencies in the world, Avramovic told 
TANJUG on Monday. 
  In the period between January 24 and May 12, the National 
Bank of Yugoslavia exchanged and bought cash to the value of 
around 509 million marks and bought around 13-million-dinars 
worth of gold, it was heard at the meeting. The National Bank 
has sold over the period a part of its foreign currency reserves 
to firms and individual persons so that the reserves have been 
enlarged by a total of around 312 marks [as received]. 
  Budget proceeds are also on the rise so that in April the 
National Bank granted credits with foreign currency coverage to 
the value of some 35 million dinars for covering budget 
deficits, it was heard at the federal government session. Under 
the stabilization programme, the budget deficit should be 
completely eliminated by July 24.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 17 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Human Rights 
and Minority Minister Margit Savovic has stated that as 
individuals, members of the ethnic Albanian community in 
Yugoslavia enjoy all rights guaranteed to all the other 
citizens. Savovic told a press conference on Tuesday she had 
written a letter to that effect to U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to refute allegations made in an appeal by 
`Albanian intellectuals'. 
  The appeal, dated May 6, in which `Albanian intellectuals' 
accuse Yugoslav authorities of flagrant human rights violations 
in the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, only testifies to 
the intention of some ethnic Albanian leaders to put an equation 
mark between the status of the ethnic Albanian minority and that 
of a constituent nation, and to alter the existing state 
borders, said Savovic in her letter to Butrus-Ghali. 
  A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in 
Kosovo-Metohija. Its leaders illegally proclaimed the province 
a republic in an attempt to take it away from Serbia and its 
parent country Yugoslavia and subsequently annex it to 
neighbouring Albania. 
  Savovic said there was no need to engage international 
organizations and bodies to monitor the implementation of human 
rights in Yugoslavia. She also said she had invited experts of 
the U.N. Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights to 
visit Yugoslavia and gain a first-hand knowledge about the 
difficult situation in which innocent children are suffering 
because of anti-Yugoslav sanctions. 
  In late May of 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough 
sanctions against Yugoslavia over its alleged involvement in 
civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In her letter to the U.N. committee, Savovic proposed that 
the experts check on the spot whether the problems the Yugoslav 
government would list in a report scheduled for release in June 
were true. Savovic argued that U.N. special human rights 
rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki did not present a true picture 
about the rights of children in Yugoslavia because he had 
covered the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia and drew a 
parallel between children in Yugoslavia and those in war-torn 
areas. `We cannot accept such an approach, because the rights 
of children in Yugoslavia are threatened precisely because of 
sanctions by which the United Nations violate its own convention 
on children's rights.' 
  The sanctions have a devastating effect on the health and 
development of Yugoslavia's 3.2 million children and more than 
193,000 refugee children. 
  The infant mortality rate has increased by 10 percent since 
the sanctions were introduced. The hemoglobin count in some 
children has been seriously affected because of a poor diet, 
with the number of children with hemoglobin defficiency 
increasing to 19.5 percent from the 8.3 percent before the 
sanctions.

  [Owen in English] [words indistinct] had a very good 
conversation with President Milosevic. We focused on the [fades 
into Jankovic's voice] You have just heard Lord Owen, who said 
that they had good talks with President Milosevic, and that they 
focused on the problem of Gorazde, where there have been 
violations recently. They talked about that a lot. Lord Owen 
told the reporters that he would try and get in touch over the 
next 24 hours with Yasushi Akashi and the two warring sides in 
order to reach a cease-fire around Gorazde. This will be one 
small step toward achieving a total cease-fire in the entire 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He also said that the contact group would meet in Washington 
at the end of the week, the well-known contact group, which will 
continue to consider the peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
two cochairmen have just left Belgrade for Zvornik, where they 
are to meet the leadership of the Serb republic and have 
concrete talks. According to Lord Owen, he discussed 
generalities with President Milosevic concerning the 
establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the sanctions, 
and he said that they would be in a package. He will discuss 
concrete details with the leadership of the republic of Srpska.

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 May (TANJUG) -- In his talks today with 
David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic said peace was in the interest of all people and all 
nations in the Yugoslav area. 
  According to a statement issued by the Serbian president's 
office, Milosevic stressed that Serbia wholeheartedly supports 
the agreement on ending all hostilities in the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question of a political 
solution and territorial demarcation should, according to 
Milosevic, be discussed with representatives of the Serb people 
from Bosnia, who are directly concerned, in exactly the same way 
as are the Muslims and Croats in this former Yugoslav republic. 
  Since all elements of the agreement on an overall end to 
hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed with 
UN and UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] delegations in Belgrade 
on 22 April, Milosevic believes that all obstacles and problems 
in reaching [as received] an agreement on ending the hostilities 
can only have been caused by the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army. He believes that the international community is again 
facing a challenge -- either to behave in an impartial way or to 
apply a policy of double standards to the parties in the 
conflict. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic attended the 
talks.

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, immediately on their arrival in Belgrade. As 
expected, the talks focused on the recent ministerial meeting 
(Russia, United States, EU) in Geneva and the agreement on 
ending hostilities in the whole of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was confirmed by David Owen, who gave 
a brief statement after the talks with Slobodan Milosevic, which 
lasted almost three hours. 
  David Owen, who was in an unusually good mood, which is not 
completely irrelevant in such situations, first described the 
talks with Slobodan Milosevic as "very good." 
  "The talks focused on ending the hostilities in the whole of 
Bosnia," Lord Owen said, adding this was "the highest priority 
issue." According to Owen, Gorazde is currently the biggest 
problem, because, as he said, the agreement was still being 
violated there. "We hope these problems will be eliminated 
within the next 24 hours and that the belligerent sides will 
attend talks with the UN secretary general's special envoy, 
Yasushi Akashi, on ending hostilities, to which they had almost 
agreed. 
  The two cochairmen will discuss these and other problems 
this 
afternoon with president of the republic of Srpska Radovan 
Karadzic. Lord Owen said he would "probably" hold talks with 
Karadzic, but did not specify where. It is unofficially 
reported that they are to meet in Zvornik. Owen said he would 
discuss the proposed 51:49 percent territorial division and the 
maps with Karadzic. 
  The issue of sanctions was also discussed in the talks with 
Slobodan Milosevic. Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg 
reiterated the position contained in the Geneva communique that 
"sanctions will be eased after the withdrawal of the Bosnian 
Serb forces from the agreed positions." 
  "There is a very clear link between the agreement on ending 
the hostilities, the withdrawal of troops, and the easing and 
lifting of the sanctions," Lord Owen said. Asked about his 
opinion of the controversial decision by the U.S. Senate 
regarding the lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian 
Muslims, Lord Owen said the decision was "contradictory in some 
way." 
  "It remains to be seen whether this proposal will appear 
either before the House of Representatives or the Senate itself. 
I believe that this will probably not happen," he added. 
  After the talks with Karadzic this afternoon, the cochairmen 
of the conference on the former Yugoslavia are returning to 
Belgrade. According to Owen they are to travel to Zagreb 
tomorrow, where they will meet Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F>
Marko Winter in Belgrade; date not given: "Serbia Hopes for 
Stabilization Despite Sanctions"] 
  [Text] Serbia now has the fifth government since the first 
multiparty elections in 1990. Mirko Marjanovic, who has been 
prime minister since March, was a well-known business manager 
before. He took office in a complicated political and -- 
notably -- economic situation. The program of stabilization, 
which has been implemented since the end of January 1994, has, 
however, already yielded the first positive results. Marko 
Winter talked to the 56-year-old government head in Belgrade. 
  [Winter] You were trying to set up a government of national 
unity, but the majority of the opposition did not participate. 
  [Marjanovic] My main target was a government that would 
implement the program of financial reform and economic recovery 
of the country as successfully as possible, for that is in the 
interest of all citizens, regardless of their political 
orientation. This explains my desire to get people from all the 
parties represented in parliament into the government. At the 
same time, I also insisted in personalities that were not linked 
to any party, but have expert knowledge, and are clearly 
committed to the program of the modern market economy. The 
deputy prime minister and other ministers are, therefore, not 
members of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]. 
  It was a mistake for the most important parties of the 
opposition not to have accepted the offer. Particularly since 
the majority of the population supports the program. 
  [Winter] What are the consequences of the sanctions against 
Yugoslavia in your country so far? 
  [Marjanovic] The direct economic damage currently stands at 
$20-30 billion. Almost 1 million men and women of the total 
work force of 2.2 million are without work. Capacity 
utilization in the industry only stands at 30-40 percent. The 
gross per-capita national product has been halved within a 
period of two years. We have lost many markets in the world and 
on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The standard of 
living, particularly of low- income earners and pensioners, has 
fallen dramatically. Considerable disturbances have been created 
in the spheres of education and social insurance. We had to 
spend a lot of money on taking care of more than 600,000 
refugees. 
  [Winter] And the political effects? 
  [Marjanovic] Despite the severe economic and social 
consequences, the sanctions have not been able to destabilize 
the country politically. In principle, the great majority of 
citizens sticks to its support for that part of the Serbian 
people that now live outside the borders of the FRY. Since the 
beginning of the "Yugoslav crisis" we have struggled for a fair 
and peaceful solution that protects the interests of the Serbs 
in the same way as it protects that of the Croats and Muslims. 
The sanctions have become useless, anyway, because we have 
fulfilled all UN demands. In Serbia and Yugoslavia we are 
creating a democratic society and a modern market economy, which 
is why we have the right to be a member of the international 
community with equal rights. 
  [Winter] What does your program of stabilization focus on? 
  [Marjanovic] Our main objective is to overcome 
hyperinflation and restore trust in the dinar. In addition, 
stable conditions should be created for an increase in 
production and for more jobs. In the first three months we 
managed to put a halt to the increase in prices. Our foreign 
currency reserves are sufficient to guarantee the convertibility 
of the dinar. The state budget is again fed by real revenues, 
and there are first signs for a recovery of production. These 
are encouraging results and great changes compared to 1993. 
  [Winter] What is most important for you now? 
  [Marjanovic] Well, now it is most important to maintain 
discipline in the state budget and to reduce last year's deficit 
radically. The austere financial policy must continue to 
guarantee the stability of the dinar. Third, we will practice 
active social policy to help those that are temporarily without 
work as a result of the sanctions and the transition to the 
market economy. I am primarily thinking of programs of 
reeducation and support for a rapid development of small- and 
medium-sized enterprises. I am an optimist in this connection, 
and expect that we will conclude the year 1994 under 
considerably more stable conditions, with economic growth, and a 
higher standard of living.

<F P=106> [Report by Z. Radovanovic: "To Return What Has Unfairly Been </F>
Taken Away"] 
  [Text] In addition to continuous internal conflicts and 
standstills caused by workers' stoppages and demands for the 
resignation of the management, the oldest Serbian factory -- 
Zastava Special Purpose Production -- has been burdened for a 
long time by irregular conditions of production at various 
levels, as well as by uncertainty regarding the further 
manufacture of arms for the needs of a reduced Yugoslav Army. 
  Last year Zastava Special Purpose Production factory, that 
makes up a quarter of the Yugoslav arms production in terms of 
number of employees and existing capacities, was one of few 
Yugoslav factories that had been working regularly and the 
business had been running rather successfully, despite all 
subjective and objective circumstances and difficulties. Hence 
the rightful demands to the government that it publicly and 
clearly states the prospects of further development of the 
special purpose production, as well as the future of the factory 
itself. 
  "This year almost no capacities of the special purpose 
production have been operative, which is not only because they 
are outdated, but also because the budget does not allocate 
enough funds for this kind of production. I do not think it 
would be good to allow this system to die, because in that case 
almost 1,300 workers would be out of work," Vukasin Filipovic, 
director general of the factory, recently warned Nikola 
Sainovic, deputy prime minister of the Federal Government, and a 
group of republican officials. 
  Director Filipovic underlined that a vital interest to the 
arms manufacturers in Kragujevac is to take over several 
production lines from the arms factory in Travnik, Bosnia, such 
as the production of artillery, howitzers, tank ammunition, and 
so forth. This would be also necessary because nowhere in the 
FRY, except partly in Kragujevac, are there capacities developed 
for such a kind of production, while their development would 
demand new investment. 
  The demands by the arms manufacturers from Kragujevac for 
the 
takeover of a considerable part of the Bosnian program of 
special purpose production also reveal a certain portion of 
nostalgia for the prestigious century-and-a-half tradition of 
the local Military-Technological Institute, which became famous 
throughout the world for the Kokinka rifles and other infantry 
and artillery weapons that were manufactured here. For that 
reason the manufacturers particularly stress that the production 
of artillery, howitzers, and other weapons was moved from 
Kragujevac to Travnik immediately after World War II, so it 
would be fair to return to them what was unjustly and unfairly 
taken away from them. 
  "There are some pressures that the production line from 
Travnik should be relocated to the Lola factory in Zeleznik. 
Lola, however, does not have any tradition, while it is not 
ready either in terms of workforce, or in any other way, to take 
over that sort of production," Filipovic says. 
  In addition, it is also demanded from the government to 
force 
the payment of debts upon Cuba, Ethiopia, Angola, and some other 
countries to which Zastava exported goods worth $71 million. 
"The Yugoslav Government made such business arrangements, so it 
is obliged to make sure that the goods are eventually paid for," 
the arms manufacturers from Kragujevac demand.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Seventy-Eight Percent See Kosova Only </F>

  [Text] According to the results of a polling organized by 
Prishtina-based Albanian weekly KOHA, out of 208 questioned 
Prishtina citizens, 78 percent see Kosova only as an independent 
state. 
  In response to the question of the possibility in reaching 
an 
eventual agreement for Kosova to remain within a possible 
federation or confederation, 69.2 percent of the questioned do 
not see such a possibility in the future, only 8.6 percent think 
that Kosova could be an equal part of any future Yugoslav 
federation or confederation, whereas 8.1 percent think that 
Kosova could never be an equal part in any federation of that 
kind. 
  In answer to the question about the possibility of the 
division of Kosova, 68 percent of the participants think that

think that the division could be done through a dialogue, while 
11 percent could not give an answer to the question.

<F P=106> [Report by R. Barjaktarevic: "A Dialogue Only at a Round </F>
Table"] 
  [Excerpts] Dr. Ranko Babic, federal deputy in the Chamber 
of Citizens, has resigned from his post of president of the 
Serbian Radical Party [SRS] County Committee for Kosovo. He 
told BORBA that there are indications that Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic will soon visit Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija]. 
Why is Dr. Ranko Babic resigning from his function of party 
head for Kosovo? 
  I have resigned for several reasons. They primarily have to 
do with considerable professional obligations at the university 
and in research work. Moreover, there are private reasons 
involved. There is also disagreement with certain moves within 
the party, but I do not wish to discuss this in detail, Ranko 
Babic said curtly. [passage omitted] 
  As a federal deputy, Ranko Babic was ready to talk to BORBA 
in greater detail about indications of "preparations for 
Milosevic's visit to Kosmet." This was prompted by President 
Milosevic's statement in front of the minister of state at the 
British Foreign Office Douglas Hogg in connection with "giving 
full political and cultural autonomy to the Albanians," and "We 
shall have no problems with that." 
  If we are to believe the diplomatic dignity of the British 
minister of state and our interpretations of Mr. Milosevic's 
answer, strengthened by the lack of any denial from his office, 
this statement could mean President Milosevic's full agreement 
with Douglas Hogg's approach that a maximal political and 
cultural local autonomy should be created in Kosmet, similar 
that in the 1974 Constitution. This would mean that Milosevic 
was denying his own position and closing the circle, but from 
below with his well-known statement in Kosovo Polje "no one must 
beat these people." [sentence as published] I wish to believe 
that the statement "we shall have no problems with that" is the 
result of a misunderstanding or a breakdown in communications. 
Otherwise, President Milosevic is attempting a fatal somersault 
that would be catastrophic for him. In connection to this, we 
may mention his penchant for inconsistent political acrobatics. 
  On the other hand, however, increased awareness -- even 
significantly increased awareness -- can be detected in the 
visit of representatives of the Yugoslav Army and the Federal 
Defense Ministry, and in the related demonstration maneuvers of 
the army and police units in Kosovo. Even the elite 63d 
Airborne Brigade from Nis was brought in and executed a 
spectacular demonstration maneuver. I believe that this is 
intended to show the authorities' great interest in the region. 
There are even indications that President Milosevic is 
preparing to visit Kosovo and Metohija in the coming period. 
Looking at this in the context of President Milosevic's earlier 
statement, we would be very disappointed in him if it turned out 
that the purpose of demonstrating such great military and policy 
"interest and allegiance" in and to Kosmet is designed simply to 
temporarily calm the resident Serbian people and dissuade them 
from moving out of Kosmet, while somewhere hidden from view, 
arrangements are being made that would be disastrous for us, 
says Babic. 
  Are not all these preparations for initiating a dialogue 
with 
the Albanians? 
  I would consider it quite abnormal that, in the context of 
all this, Milosevic's arrival in Kosmet would mean the promotion 
or the initiation of a process of dialogue with representatives 
of the ethnic Albanian political organizations, but one that 
would ultimately lead to an unacceptably oversized autonomy.

  [Text] Considering the obvious increase in tensions around 
Sarajevo in the past few days, we have looked at the provisions 
of the NATO ultimatum of 10 February this year to see under what 
conditions the ultimatum is applicable, and came to the 
conclusion that the current situation is unsatisfactory. This 
was stated in a letter that Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, today sent to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, chairman of the Security Council, 
and Manfred Woerner, secretary general of NATO. Although more 
than three months have passed, heavy weapons have not been 
completely withdrawn from around Sarajevo, nor have they been 
placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control, President 
Izetbegovic writes. 
  According to the information of the state leadership of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aggressor still has one tank in 
Zlatiste, one 122-mm gun in the Ilijas area, and one tank in the 
Busile area. In Hadzici, the enemy has one tank and two 
antiaircraft guns. In Grbavica, it has one tank, two armored 
personnel carriers, and two (?three-barrel) antiaircraft guns. 
The Serbs have another tank in Vojkovici. Regarding enemy 
weapons in Vogosca, there are still two antiaircraft guns, one 
mortar, and one hill gun there. 
  Since the responsible officials in UNPROFOR are aware of 
this 
situation, President Izetbegovic continues, but are not doing 
anything against the aggressor apart from issuing appeals and 
pleas, we ask ourselves whether the Security Council resolution 
is binding for them and whether they are empowered to carry out 
their private policy and personally assess what should and 
should not be done. 
  No one has the right to play with the security of the town 
that has suffered so much and with the lives of its residents. 
Therefore, we expect the measures needed to put the situation in 
the Sarajevo exclusion zone in order to be taken without delay. 
This was stated in a letter that President Izetbegovic has sent 
to the UN secretary general, the chairman of the Security 
Council, and the secretary general of NATO.

warplanes buzzed Tuzla Tuesday [17 May] at UN request after 
Bosnian Serbs shelled the Moslem city's airport, but the 
aircraft did not open fire, a UN spokesman said. UN Protection 
Force spokesman here Jen Kirk did not specify how many planes 
took part in the operation. He said the planes were called in 
at 2:00 p.m. (1200 GMT) after seven shells hit the airport of 
the northern Bosnian city while the first plane to arrive in a 
month was being unloaded. No one was injured in the shelling.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] New York, May 17 (TANJUG) -- United Nations 
spokesman for peacekeeping missions Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday 
that the situation in central Bosnia-Herzegovina had 
considerably deteriorated as a result of offensive actions of 
the Bosnian Moslem forces on Serb positions. Bosnian Moslems 
have been attacking for days Serb positions on Mount Ozren east 
of Doboj, Mount Vlasic north-west of Travnik and Mount Majevica 
near Tuzla in north-eastern Bosnia. Cease-fire was also 
violated by intensified sniper fire and fire from other weapons 
in Sarajevo while in other parts of Bosnia the situation is more 
or less normal, only with sporadic clashes, Eckhard told 
reporters. 
  At the ministerial meeting of the United States, Russia and 
the European Union in Geneva on Friday, the participants asked 
Bosnia's warring sides to stop fighting for a period of four 
months. The Serb side accepted the proposal but said it 
preferred a permanent truce while the Moslem leadership rejected 
it. Eckhard said that about eight shells had been fired on 
Tuzla airfield during the landing of an UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] plane which carried equipment for locating mortar 
positions and which will be positioned around the 
Moslem-controlled town of Tuzla and Brcko, a Serb town in 
northern Bosnia around which the Moslem side has been massing 
troops lately. 
  No casualties were reported in the attack, said Eckhard and 
added that the shells were believed to have come from the Serb 
side. While the Moslem offensive is escalating, the U.S. media 
is almost completely ignoring it, which is evidently the old 
recipe of never mentioning Moslem assaults so that a possible 
Serb counter-attack could be later presented as an "act of 
aggression." 
  Such a scenario was applied in the case of Gorazde, where 
the 
Bosnian Serb Army in March stopped a Moslem offensive -- 
launched from the U.N.-proclaimed "safe area" which should have 
been demilitarized last year -- and pushed back the Moslem 
forces towards the centre of Gorazde in a counter-attack.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 17 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem forces on 
Tuesday [17 May] launched mortar and anti-aircraft attacks on 
Serb positions and settlements in the Sarajevo front, Bosnian 
Serb military sources have said. The sources said that in the 
Ilijas area the Moslems fired 82mm mortars on Serb positions, 
and opened anti-aircraft fire on the Krcevine region from the 
Visocica area. In the Ilidza part of the Sarajevo front, the 
Moslems attacked from the stojcevic region on the Luzani 
settlement and Serb positions in the area of the forestry school 
and the Vrucci suburb. Moslem snipers on Tuesday opened fire 
from the direction of the Vojnicko Polje on Nedjarici, from the 
direction of Strupsko Brdo on Kasindolska street, from the right 
bank of the Miljacka river on Grbavica, and from the direction 
of Sokolje on the Rajlovac barracks, the Bosnian Serb Army 
sources said.

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Resuming 
their offensive against the republic of Srpska, Muslim units are 
still using chemical weapons in the Majevica area where they 
have enjoyed UNPROFOR's military backing again, TANJUG learned 
today from republic of Srpska army sources. According to these 
sources, strong Muslim attacks in cooperation with UNPROFOR's 
Nordic unit continued against most Serbian defense positions on 
Mount Majevica, particularly against Serbian villages in the 
Stolice area. Muslim units again targeted Serbs with large 
caliber chlorine-charged shells in addition to artillery and 
infantry weapons. Serbian military sources pointed out that for 
the second consecutive day a part of UNPROFOR's Nordic unit 
continued to provide military back-up for the Muslim side. The 
same unit targeted the Serbs with tank fire yesterday, also 
using armored personnel carriers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 17 (AFP) -- Cease-fire violations are 
becoming increasingly common in Sarajevo where frequent sniper 
fire was reported Tuesday, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
said Tuesday [17 May]. UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said 
shooting in the center of Sarajevo "has been steadily 
increasing" and was of great concern to the UNPROFOR and the 
country's warring factions which means those responsible "are 
probably uncontrolled" elements. He said Bosnian Serb troops 
targeted a French Gazelle helicopter Monday as it was flying 
over Ilijas, some about 15 kilometres (10 miles) northwest of 
Sarajevo, but the pilot and crew were not injured. 
  Two armoured French vehicles were also targeted in the 
capital Monday. The shooting is in violation of a ceasefire 
agreement signed by Bosnia's warring parties in February after 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization threatened air strikes. 
Annink said that elsewhere in Bosnia the military activity was 
centered near the northern town of Tuzla. He said UN military 
observers stationed in the region counted more than 80 
explosions in various areas Monday. Mortar explosions were also 
reported in eastern and western Bosnia.

  [Text] Brcko, May 17 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem and Croat 
forces on Tuesday attacked Bosnian Serb positions in an attempt 
to cut off the Serb land corridor in the Posavina region near 
Brcko in northern Bosnia. Around 15:00 hours local time on 
Tuesday, Moslem forces fired 15 82-mm shells on Serb positions 
in Begovaca in the Brcko area, Bosnian Serb army sources said in 
a statement. The Bosnian Serb army did not return fire, it said. 
  Croat units in Orasje, Posavina, opened fire from 
anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-tank weapons on Serb 
settlements of Lesnici and Jenjici, the statement said, adding 
that the Serb side again did not return fire. Croatian and 
especially Moslem forces have massed heavily armed units around 
Brcko, a town which is situated in the narrowest part of the 
Serb land corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the 
Bosnian Serb republic. Moslem and Croat military commanders 
have announced an offensive on this part of the Serb corridor. 
  Earlier this month, Moslem forces launched artillery attacks 
on central Brcko, killing four civilians and wounding 15, which 
was confirmed by monitors of the United Nations Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR).

supervise the implementation of these Agreements' provisions. 
  Ivo Komsic, president of the council and member of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, spoke about other issues at the 
conference. He stressed that among the Croatian people there is 
a consensus on the implementation of the Constitution of the 
Federation. However, the problem lies elsewhere, in the 
interpretation of the essence of the Federation, Komsic said, 
immediately answering the question on what the Croatian National 
Council considers the essence of the Federation's organization 
and establishment: The Federation is not some final state of 
affairs set by the Croats and the Bosniaks in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is primarily a [word indistinct] or a 
path toward the reintegration of all the occupied territories of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian National Council of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue to interprete the Federation in 
this way, Komsic said. 
  On behalf of the council, Komsic invited the Serbian people 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to join in with the agreements on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a common homeland, stressing that the 
Serbian Civil Council is the true representative of these 
people. He also repeated the view of the Croatian National 
Council, namely that the council opposes the corridor through 
Bosanska Posavina [in the Brcko region], because the corridor is 
not in the interest of the Croatian people as a whole.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rockets From Honeycomb"] </F>
  [Text] The honeycombed rocket launcher, that was used as 
an airborne weapon until now, has recently been modified, and is 
successfully being used in land battles on many fronts in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The army of the republic of Srpska can 
boast more than two years of war experience, and during that 
time the effectiveness of many kinds of weapons has been 
actually tested in battles, while many weapons have been 
modified and adjusted to meet some practical demands. Although 
the military textbooks strictly proscribe the use of certain 
weapons, experience has shown that innovations are always 
welcome. 
  A photograph taken by REUTER news agency several days ago at 
Serbian positions near Brcko shows four of these honeycombed 
rocket launchers (normally used as an airborne weapon) installed 
on a truck, and used for shelling targets on the ground. This 
mobile rocket launcher of middle-ranging destructive power, the 
modified version, contains 48 shells in one charge. 
  This rocket launcher has the greatest effect if it is used 
in 
combination with other standard artillery weapons and rocket 
systems, in fighting across wide front lines, where the distance 
from the enemy is relatively short. Its range is only several 
kilometers, but the effect is great because a great number of 
rockets disperse over a wide area over a rather short period of 
time. The rockets are neither guided, nor self-guided, but this 
does not diminish their effect in any case, because of their 
wide dispersion. Compared with other similar weapons, the 
destructive effect of the honeycombed launcher approximates to 
that of the Osa rocket launcher, but the difference is that its 
one charge contains 48 times the number of rockets in a charge 
of the Osa. 
  The honeycombed launcher's firing system is electrically 
activated, and it is possible to activate several launchers 
linked together on the same platform at the same time. The 
recharging is done relatively simply and quickly, but in order 
to achieve that at least four gunners are necessary. 
  In the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] the honeycombed 
rocket launcher was a part of the equipment of almost all 
fighter aircraft: the Jastreb, the Galeb, the Super Galeb, the 
Orao, and the MiG-29. It was also installed in MI-8 transport 
helicopters. These launchers were also used against ground 
targets. In the storehouses of the JNA in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina a great quantity of such launchers were 
deposited, and in the course of time they have been modified 
quite successfully, and are now being used for fighting on the 
ground. At the beginning the launchers were manufactured in the 
former Soviet Union, but it was quite a long time ago that the 
manufacture was taken over by Yugoslav arms factories.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Lipold: The Government Wants To Present </F>
NATO a Clear Idea of Partnership"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Foreign Ministry expects no need for 
major changes by the North Atlantic Alliance to the Czech 
Republic presentation document on the Partnership for Peace plan 
that will be handed over to the NATO center in Brussels. 
  On the basis of the report approved by the government on 
Wednesday [11 May], the NATO leadership will draft the specific 
program of cooperation with the Czech Republic and submit it to 
Prague. 
  "The proposal for cooperation with NATO is realistic," Ivan 
Busniak, director general of the Foreign Ministry Euroatlantic 
Section opines. According to the experience of the diplomats, 
the ideas of certain other states that signed the Partnership 
are too ambitious for NATO. 
  In the end, there will apparently be fewer than 20 countries 
that join the project. Although the plan of close cooperation 
with the North Atlantic Alliance facilitates an individual 
approach on the part of the Alliance to each of the countries, 
it is expected that the mutual relationship that each of the 
Central European countries will have with NATO will be analogous 
and closer than that of the East European countries or the 
former Soviet Union. 
  "NATO will not wait with the cooperation plan for Central 
European countries until it is clear what the position of Russia 
will be with respect to the Partnership," Ivan Busniak concludes. 
  The Partnership for Peace does not give the countries that 
join it any security guarantees from NATO; rather, it assures 
them of security consultations with the Alliance in the event 
their independence or territorial integrity are threatened. The 
outcome of the consultations could be, above all, diplomatic 
activities of the NATO countries. Direct military assistance is 
considered only as the last recourse. 
  The expenses arising from the participation of the Czech 
Republic in the Partnership are estimated at tens of millions 
annually. According to Busniak, however, the Czech Republic is 
one of the few states that have realized from the very beginning 
that they will have to pay the necessary costs. 
  The Czech Republic offered NATO in the presentation document 
the UN base near Cesky Krumlov and training facilities in 
Boletice. This year, the Czech military zones are to be used for 
exercise purposes also by French and German soldiers. 
  The joint training and cooperation with the NATO armies 
should also facilitate the participation of Czech soldiers in UN 
peace operations. After all, the core of UN peacekeeping forces 
is often the units of the NATO-member countries.

<F P=106> [Article by "ajk": "According to Devaty, BIS Still Needs </F>
Former StB Agents"] 
  [Text] Prague--Approximately 5 percent of the employees at 
the Security Information Service [BIS] are former State Security 
[StB] agents. Stanislav Devaty, acting director of the secret 
service, said at the meeting with the members of the Defense and 
Security Committee of the Chamber yesterday that, although he is 
not completely satisfied with BIS personnel, the office 
continues to use the expert knowledge of some agents of the 
communist secret police. 
  "I employ them because they are experts particularly on 
intelligence technology and are therefore qualified to provide 
training for new employees," Devaty explained and added that not 
a single one of them worked at the StB in the Department for 
Combating the Internal Enemy. 
  Devaty illustrated this by the example of one of the top men 
in the BIS Economic Department who accompanied him yesterday to 
the parliament. 
  Devaty also informed the deputies that BIS spent 489 million 
korunas [Kc] from the State Treasury last year.

  [Excerpts] Czech Cabinet ministers held a meeting today. 
Ales Hermanek reports. 
  [Hermanek] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Klaus expressed 
his disappointment with regard to the progress of talks on 
Russia's debts to the Czech Republic. He said that the 
accommodating attitude the Russian prime minister demonstrated 
with regard to this problem during Klaus's recent visit to 
Russia had not been reflected in concrete deeds by Russian 
Government officials. Because the deadline of 30 May, when the 
methods of debt repayment were due to be resolved, is 
threatened, Prime Minister Klaus plans to telephone Russian 
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin on 18 May and agree on further and 
more vigorous action with him.

<F P=106> [Article by rum: "The Government Is Expected To Approve Last </F>
Year's Budget Today"] 
  [Text] Prague (rum)--The proposal for the final accounting 
for 1993 shows an overall surplus of 1.08 billion korunas [Kc]. 
At the same time, the asset side of the state budget showed 
Kc99,000 short of being Kc358 billion, and the expenditure side 
was Kc356.91 billion. This is included in the report on the 
final state accounting, which was to be approved today by the 
government session. 
  In the proposal for utilizing the above-listed surplus, the 
largest amount is destined for strengthening the reserves set 
aside for solving social problems. Almost Kc340 million is 
proposed to establish an authority to administer and control 
taxes, including legal protection for individual data in the 
hands of the tax authority. The budget for last year had been 
voted on an as being balanced in the original amount of Kc342.2 
billion. Because of favorable developments, the government 
increased the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget by 
Kc9.2 billion at midyear. During the last adjustment of the 
budget, it was raised to Kc354 billion. According to the 
proposal for the final accounting, actual revenues had thus 
amounted to 101.1 percent. On the other hand, expenditures were 
drawn down at the rate of 100.8 percent [as published]. 
Moreover, the results of territorial budgets for 1993 ended up 
with an overall surplus of more than Kc11 billion, with revenues 
of Kc101 billion and expenditures of Kc90 billion.

"The Economy of the Czech Republic Developed in the First 
Quarter According to Expectations"] 
  [Text] Industrial output of the Czech Republic was 0.9 
percent higher in March than in the same period last year. In 
the first quarter, industrial output fell 0.7 percent short of 
last year's level. A marked increase, by a quarter, was 
recorded by small organizations and individual businessmen. The 
volume of merchandise production in organizations with 25 or 
more employees was 3 percent lower than in the first quarter of 
last year. The production of goods increased in the paper and 
printing industries by 15.1 percent; in coking and refinery oil 
processing by 5.9 percent; in the food and condiments industry 
by 2.7 percent; in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry by 
1.4 percent; in the glass, ceramics, china, and construction 
material industries and the industries that manufacture 
electrical and optical instruments by 0.5 percent. It declined 
in all other areas. 
  The number of employees in larger industrial enterprises 
declined by 5.5 percent in the first quarter in comparison with 
the same period last year, to 1,353,000 people. Average monthly 
wages reached 6,102 korunas [Kc]--i.e., 13.8 percent (real wages 
3.1 percent) more than in the first quarter of 1993. 
  Construction output was 4.1 percent higher in March, 6.2 
percent higher in the first quarter than in the same period last 
year. It was 8.2 percent higher in the first quarter in 
organizations with 25 or more employees. The number of 
employees in these organizations was 219,000 in January-March 
1994--i.e., 1.2 percent more--and their average monthly wages 
reached Kc6,674--i.e., 14.4 percent (real wages 3.3 percent) 
more. 
  The public freight forwarded 43.4 million tonnes of 
cargo--i.e., 7 percent less than in the first quarter of 1993. 
  Sales of slaughter hogs were 0.9 percent higher in the first 
quarter, while sales of slaughter cattle declined by 8 percent, 
poultry by 28.4 percent, milk by 6.7 percent, and eggs by 4.7 
percent. 
  The cost of living in white-collar workers' households rose 
in March 2.6 percent from December 1993, in farmers' households 
by 2 percent, and in pensioners' households by 2.8 percent. 
Expenditure on services grew the fastest. 
  The overall volume of retail sales in current prices was 
16.4 
percent higher in the first quarter and, in physical terms, rose 
by 7.4 percent in comparison with the same period last year. 
  The number of job seekers seasonally declined in March to 
184,500 and was 32,900 higher than a year ago.

<F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "The Constitution According to </F>
the SLD--Weakening the President"] 
  [Text] What will the president be doing if the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] manages to push through its 
constitutional draft? He will be awarding medals and shaking 
diplomats' hands. 
  In April of 1993 (in the previous Sejm), the SLD submitted 
its own constitutional draft. Since then, Lech Walesa 
successfully made life miserable for the SLD several times 
already. 
  As soon as Walesa signed the Budget Law, a group of Sejm 
deputies for the SLD made an attempt to amend the Small 
Constitution. They wanted to severely limit presidential powers, 
but the Belweder reacted in strong terms: The president even 
made a declaration that he "will dissolve the Sejm" even if he 
is "subsequently charged by the Tribunal of State." 
  In the end, however, a cease-fire came into force: 
Aleksander Kwasniewski promised that the SLD will not tinker 
with the Small Constitution, and Walesa promised to accept the 
SLD's new candidate for finance minister, as well as allow 
deputy ministers coming from the SLD into the Ministries of 
Defense, Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. 
<H5>  Corrections After a Lesson </H5>
  But, after this lesson, the SLD changed its previous draft 
of 
the "big" constitution. It blows a strike, first of all, to the 
president, whoever he happens to be (presidential elections are 
scheduled for fall 1995). 
  The SLD draft suggests cutting short the president's term of 
office from six years (the old version) to five years. Instead, 
the Sejm's term would be expanded: It would last until the 
first session of a new Sejm. The SLD wants to avoid a case 
similar to that of Hanna Suchocka, who was in power without the 
Sejm's supervision. 
  The point is also to make it impossible for a future 
president to block governmental nominations (as happened in the 
case of Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's initial candidate for the post 
of finance minister), to drag his feet over signing the budget, 
or to try to avoid accepting individuals from the governing 
party or coalition into the presidential ministries. 
<H5>  Almighty Prime Minister </H5>
  The SLD now wants the Sejm to appoint a prime minister, with 
the president having a say only after four unsuccessful attempts 
by the Sejm (he could also order early elections in such cases.) 
Under the previous draft, it was the president who made a 
motion in the Sejm to have a candidate approved. 
  The SLD also changed its mind concerning ministers: They are 
to be appointed not by the president but by the prime minister 
(under the old version, the president was to perform the role of 
a notary public; he would sign a nomination at the request of 
the government's chief). The president would lose the privilege 
of appointing the attorney general. According to the SLD's new 
draft, this would be done by the Sejm, which would also appoint 
a chancellor of the law, who would supervise the conformity of 
draft laws with the legal system. 
<H5>  A Lesson Over Budget </H5>
  The Polish Peasant Party and the SLD were scared until the 
very last moment that Walesa might not sign this year's budget. 
The SLD wants to avoid such traumas in the future: Under the 
proposals, the president would have to either sign the budget or 
veto it within seven days. However, the Sejm could overrule 
such a veto by a three-fifths' majority, thus forcing the 
president to sign the budget anyway. 
  Under the previous draft, the SLD treated the budget almost 
the same way as other types of laws: The president could sign 
or veto the budget within 15 days; he could also address an 
inquiry to the Constitutional Tribunal over the budget's 
conformity with the Constitution. 
<H5>  Concordat, Work, Personality </H5>
  The SLD has been saying for a long time that the Concordat 
with the Vatican is discriminatory vis-a-vis non-Catholic 
churches. In the new constitutional draft, the party makes 
things perfectly clear: Nobody can be placed at an advantage by 
any kind of law or international agreement. 
  The SLD declares a regime of a "social market economy" (even 
though the statute of Social Democracy of the Polish People's 
Republic speaks of democratic socialism), it wants to provide 
legislative guarantees for a 40-hour workweek (which the 
striking miners demanded recently), and it guarantees a right to 
organize strikes, but it also leaves a safety valve in the form 
of the possibility of banning strikes, for instance, in 
strategic sectors of the economy. 
  The SLD declares in its draft that work is "the fundamental 
precondition for the development of the human personality," and 
it wants to give every citizen the right to "unrestricted 
development of his or her personality" and to "freely chosen 
work done for just remuneration." 
  The SLD promises free education in public schools, free 
health service at public clinics and hospitals (but only such 
services as are "necessary for health protection"), and the 
right to a dwelling.

<F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "Trade Unionists Have Come Up With Their </F>
Own Constitutional Draft--Constitution by Solidarity"] 
  [Text] In accordance with the principles of a 
constitutional draft prepared on the initiative of Solidarity, 
the president of the country would be authorized in special 
cases to declare martial law or a state of emergency during 
which some human and civil rights could be suspended, as well as 
some laws, such as the budget law, tax laws, and laws concerning 
monetary and credit policies. If the National Commission of 
Solidarity decides today to adopt the draft, Solidarity, in line 
with a new law on the proceedings for the preparation and 
adoption of a constitution, will have to collect 500,000 
signatures under the draft before the trade union submits it to 
the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission. 
  The draft puts emphasis on the country's democratic nature 
and on the chief position in the nation, which is the source of 
all power. The draft also stresses the role of work as the basis 
for the country's development, and also the role of the right of 
ownership and a right to inheritance, as well as the economy's 
free market nature. The draft envisages a division of power 
between three branches and says that exercising power takes 
place through representatives, a referendum, and a citizens' 
legislative initiative that would be supported by votes of at 
least 200,000 voters. 
  The president would be the head of state and would perform 
the role of an umpire between the Sejm and the government. He 
would order parliamentary elections, and he would enjoy the 
right to veto laws that have been adopted. Such vetoes could be 
overruled by the Sejm with a three-fifths majority (according to 
the Small Constitution, the Sejm can overrule a presidential 
veto with a two-thirds majority.) The draft also says the 
president could be brought to justice by the Supreme Court 
performing the function of a Tribunal of State, based on a Sejm 
resolution adopted by a three-fifths qualified majority. 
(According to the Small Constitution, the president may be 
brought to justice by a resolution of the National Assembly 
adopted by a majority of at least two-thirds of votes of the 
total number of members of the National Assembly, on a motion of 
at least one-fourth of the total number of the total number of 
members of the Assembly). 
  The trade union's constitutional draft guarantees the right 
to education to everyone, but only public schools are listed as 
free of charge. The draft also says everybody has a right to 
health protection, while the public authorities create the right 
conditions, making it possible to implement the right in 
practice.

<F P=106> [Article by "D.S.": "Finance Ministry Proposes Shares in </F>
Return for New Bonds"] 
  [Text] Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, has announced that he will initiate new 
proposals for special State Treasury bonds, which would be 
indexed on the basis of an indicator of industrial prices and 
that people will be able to exchange for shares in enterprises 
subject to capital privatization. Such instruments should make 
the offer of sales of enterprises, banks, and insurance 
institutions being privatized more attractive. 
  According to Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, the operation should 
contribute to decreasing the level of public debt: "We cannot 
tolerate a situation where, as a result of the transformation 
process, the state will be left without any assets and with a 
huge public debt," Kolodko stated. At this stage of the 
initiative, the Finance Ministry refuses to reveal details of 
the introduction of this new instrument. Dariusz Kostyrka, 
deputy director of the Public Debt Department at the ministry 
only reported that the ministry prepares plans for new bond 
issues every year, after the Budget Law is adopted. This year, 
there are plans for the following: a one-year issue in June (a 
prospectus has already been signed), the continuation of 
previously issued bonds (one is a two-year issue and the other a 
five-year one), and a three-year issue scheduled for August. 
  The Securities Commission [KPW] has noted with satisfaction 
the announcement of introducing yet another debt instrument. 
However, according to KPW Press Spokesman Jacek Jonak, before 
issuing such bonds, the ministry should consider whether all of 
the commitments arising out of the second issue have been 
implemented in accordance with what had been announced. The KPW 
noted that, despite the creation of a legal framework (an 
ordinance issued by the finance minister in 1989), there are 
problems with exchanging bonds for shares. The legal provisions 
provide that people can pay for State Treasury-owned shares with 
bonds at a 20-percent discount in relation to the bonds' face 
value plus interest payments. 
  Civil Rights Spokesman Tadeusz Zielinski has addressed the 
finance minister and asked him to undertake decisive measures to 
make the implementation of such operations possible. According 
to Zielinski, the situation undermines citizens' confidence in 
the state apparatus. "It is outrageous that, throughout the 
four years, no proceedings were ever worked out that would 
enable citizens to implement their claims on the basis of bond 
ownership," Zielinski stated.

<F P=106> [Article by "J.K.K.": "GUS on April Economic </F>
Situation--Higher Inflation"] 
  [Text] The Central Office of Statistics [GUS] 
reports that, in April, prices for merchandise and consumer 
services were, on average, 2.9 percent higher than in March. 
Over the same period, prices for output sold in industry rose 
by 1 percent, which was mainly the result of an increase in the 
cost of industrial activity (by 1.7 percent) and of increases in 
the cost of supplying electricity and water (by 1.1 
percent). 
  Inflation in January, February, and March was 1.8 percent, 
1.1 percent, and 2 percent, respectively. In the first 10 days 
of May, prices for merchandise and consumer services rose by 1 
percent. 
  In April, compared with March, prices on services rose the 
most--that is, by 4.3 percent. In the same period, prices on 
food products rose by 2.8 percent, on nonfood products by 2 
percent, and on alcohol by 1.7 percent. 
  According to GUS, the increase in prices on services was 
influenced mainly by the April increases in prices for central 
heating and hot water and also by increases in prices for Polish 
State Railroads monthly passes, prices for one-time tickets on 
the State Motor Transport system, and an increase in fees for 
stays in convalescent houses, which tripled. On the other hand, 
the increase in food prices was influenced by seasonal price 
rises with regard to potatoes, vegetables, and fruit (by 9.2 
percent) and by an increase in prices for meat and similar 
products, which were higher than in the preceding months (by 1.6 
percent). 
  Throughout the first four months of this year, prices rose 
by 
30.9 percent compared with the same period last year. Over the 
time period, prices on services rose the most (32.7 percent), 
followed by nonfood products (31.7 percent). Prices on food 
rose by 30.1 percent and on alcohol by 22.5 percent. 
  As GUS reports, the biggest impact on the price changes in 
the production sector came from a price increase in those 
sectors that have a high value of sold output (products made 
from nonmetal raw materials, chemicals, chemical products, and 
artificial fibers). 
  The average monthly salary in the enterprise sector was 
5,319,900 zlotys [Z] in April, which represents a drop of 1.8 
percent from March, while the average salary computed without 
payments from profits and without a balance surplus in 
cooperatives, was Z5,088,700, which is an increase of 1.9 
percent from March.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Kurek, director of the Petrobaltic Oil </F>
and Gas Prospecting and Extracting Company, by correspondent 
Grzegorz Jasny; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Jasny] Last month, after several years of 
investigation, hard work, and negotiations, Petrobaltic was 
granted a license to extract petroleum from under the Baltic Sea 
floor. Initially, more than 100,000 tonnes of oil were extracted 
from Sector B-3 in a so-called test production operation. 
Full-scale industrial production is beginning now. How much 
oil is there in the area designated Sector B-3? 
  [Kurek] The size of our oil deposits is an official secret. 
One of the reasons for this is that these resources constitute a 
part of our strategic reserve. All I can tell you is that, 
during the first stage of operations, we will extract 500 tonnes 
of crude oil per day from four wells. Once the field is fully 
operational, we should be able to obtain 1,500-1,700 tonnes of 
oil per day. 
  [Jasny] Petroleum extraction is one of the more profitable 
economic undertakings, but it must be remembered that you have 
had to bear very considerable costs associated with developing 
the site for industrial extraction. Has this money been 
recouped yet? 
  [Kurek] The money we made from the sale of the oil obtained 
in the test production stage is not the only sum we have earned 
so far. Our vessels also earned money by offering contract 
services to North Sea oil-extraction enterprises, and the 
profits from these operations were used to partly finance our 
own current expenses. However, it is true that, recently, the 
major proportion of our financial resources has come from the 
sale of our own oil. We not only recouped the equivalent of the 
outlays made to date but we were also able to ensure that the 
company is largely independent financially, using little outside 
assistance, and that we discharge all of our obligations in 
respect of the state budget. 
  [Jasny] I understand from this that you ended the last 
financial year with a profit. Is that correct? 
  [Kurek] It is. 
  [Jasny] As far as I know, extraction from the oil field you 
are working at the moment is planned to continue for 
approximately a dozen years. What will Petrobaltic do when that 
is finished? 
  [Kurek] Our company's very name indicates two different 
types of operations. The first is prospecting for crude oil and 
other raw materials, identifying deposits, and estimating the 
amount of raw materials found there. The second is extracting 
these raw materials. Apart from developing the B-3 sector for 
extraction, we have been carrying out parallel operations in 
prospecting for and identifying further deposits of hydrocarbon 
materials. We already know that there is a rather small oil 
deposit north of Rozewie that could be economically viable for 
extraction. To recap: Apart from our extraction operations, we 
also carry out a program of identification and documentation of 
further crude oil deposits, which we may develop for extraction 
at some future point. 
  [Jasny] Your company intends not only to operate in the 
Baltic area but also to extend its offer to the Asian seas. 
Could you tell us a bit more about this project today? 
  [Kurek] A petroleum extraction company should not be run as 
a provincial firm. It must be expansive and aim to actively 
extend its field of operation. We are currently in the course 
of negotiating cooperation in our particular business field with 
the Baltic states. Everything indicates that we will be able to 
work together with other oil companies in developing new 
extraction sites belonging to these countries. Perhaps we will 
also--together with other countries--search for and extract oil 
deposits in the Asian seas. That would be an excellent start in 
turning our company into an international business. Naturally, 
I cannot release any details concerning the aforementioned 
negotiations because these are always confidential. 
  [Jasny] Is your company sufficiently prepared to enter the 
international scene? 
  [Kurek] We must meet three essential preconditions if we 
want to be taken seriously in the international oil market. We 
must employ credible professionals, we must have considerable 
previous experience, and, finally, we must have sufficient 
financial backing. Any bank will lend money to a healthy and 
prosperous oil-extraction company. We do indeed meet all of 
these conditions. 
  [Jasny] Nevertheless, your plans of expanding your business 
operations to include other seas around the world are still at 
the project stage, although I hope they will come true. But to 
come back to the concerns of the present day, we should also 
remember that all extraction operations carry with them an 
ecological risk of damage to the environment. Have you made 
sufficient precautions against--God forbid--some unwelcome 
developments in that area? 
  [Kurek] From the very first stage of our operations--that 
is, the gathering of information on potential deposits and the 
designing of the proposed prospecting work--we pursue an 
integrated environmental protection program. Our equipment 
comprises machines and technical appliances that permit the 
extraction of crude oil without damaging the natural 
environment. We meet all of the requirements imposed on our 
particular kind of operation by the Helsinki Convention. We 
have at our disposal a range of state-of-the-art oil extraction 
technologies. There are no better solutions anywhere in the 
world. The system we use in Sector B-3 is fitted with multiple 
safeguards, and there is practically no possibility that the 
waters of the Baltic could become contaminated as a result of 
our operations. 
  [Jasny] Thank you for talking with us.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacek Czarnecki: "Arms Industry; Empty Pockets"] </F>
  [Text] The arms industry today employs half as many people 
as it did in 1988. Exports have dropped by 85 percent, and 
orders from the Polish Army have plummeted catastrophically. 
Over the past four years, the arms industry has lost its 
"traditional" markets in the Middle East and East Asia, as well 
as in the former Soviet Union. One year ago, the indebtedness 
of the special enterprises came to 12 trillion zlotys [Z]; today 
it already exceeds Z15 trillion. 
  It is difficult to see any chance to change this situation. 
Exports are still effectively blocked by the so-called negative 
list of countries to which arms cannot be sold, as well as by 
the atmosphere of scandal related to the Polish arms trade. The 
Ministry of National Defense will spend only about Z4 trillion 
for the purchase of new equipment. Experts from the Central 
Planning Administration say that, to improve the condition of 
the arms-industry sector, the Army should buy Z7 to 8 trillion 
worth of equipment in 1994. 
<H5>  Exports Without Significance </H5>
  The arms industry is not getting any money for 
restructuring. 
The production potential, the maintenance of which requires 
billions of zlotys a year, would be sufficient to meet the needs 
of a 500,000-member army. Only 20 percent of this potential is 
now being used. It is not known what should be done with the 
rest, as well as with the people employed at defense industry 
enterprises. 
  Before 1990, as many as 80 companies worked to meet the 
needs 
of the defense industry. The main recipients of armaments were 
the almost 500,000-member Polish Army, the armies of the Warsaw 
Pact, and the countries of the Middle East and East Asia. From 
1965 to 1990, the Polish arms industry supplied 11,000 tanks, 
5,800 self-acting howitzers, 1,600 artillery tractors, 8,600 
armored transports, 6,000 helicopters, 1.5 million guns and 
machine guns, as well as vast quantities of ammunition. Between 
1984 and 1991, Poland exported armaments worth $1.8 billion and 
7 billion transferable rubles. In the years 1979-89, tank 
exports alone yielded $2.5 billion. Over 80 percent of the arms 
were sent to the former Soviet Union. 
  The disintegration of the Council for Economic Mutual 
Assistance and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact spelled the 
end of the "golden times" for our arms industry. As a 
consequence of the imposition of a UN embargo on Iraq, Libya, 
and Serbia, the arms-producing factories have lost hundreds of 
millions of U.S. dollars. Sejm deputies have recently been 
trying to force the idea of suspending the negative list, which, 
according to the arms-industry enterprises, is too long. It 
includes countries not found on the UN embargo list, such as 
Burma, Somalia, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Mozambique, Sudan, and 
Taiwan. 
  Polish arms are no longer playing a major role on world 
markets. According to the Stockholm-based Peace Research 
Institute (SIPRI), Poland's share in the world arms trade does 
not exceed 1 percent. Former "fraternal armies," which once 
received a large portion of our products, now have arms 
surpluses of their own. 
<H5>  Arms Industry to Civilian Life </H5>
  Arms-producing enterprises could not endure such a sudden 
and 
drastic limitation of their markets. Currently working for the 
Army are 31 companies that have acquired special status. They 
are burdened with the task of maintaining the defense reserve 
(RO) in the event of a war, as well as the production of 
equipment to meet current needs and--most willingly--for export. 
The other factories must switch over to production for the 
civilian market. This task is also imposed on the enterprises of 
the "thirty." Easier said than done, the directors of the 
companies say. The factories do not have enough money for 
investment in the civilian sector of production; however, some 
of them get on somehow. 
  The Mesko factory in Skarzysko-Kamienna manufactures, aside 
from ammunition and rocket missiles, light agricultural machines 
and electric-light fixtures, among other products. The Machine 
Enterprises in Tarnow, aside from small guns and heavy machine 
guns, produces machine tools and cooling aggregates, also for 
the civilian market. The Kasprzak Radio Company, in addition to 
military electronics, also manufactures cassette recorders and 
radios. To maintain a given company's positive earning 
capacity, production for the civilian market in arms-producing 
factories should constitute approximately 60 percent, whereas 
military production, along with RO, no more than 40 percent. 
The snag is that most of the arms industry companies do not 
have appropriate technologies that would allow them to 
manufacture "civilian" commodities competitive as far as their 
quality is concerned. 
  In most of the companies, adjustment of the production 
volume to the volume of orders and limitation of manufacturing 
capacities resulting from the lack of demand for the "civilian" 
products, often entail considerable limitations in employment. 
For example, in the Machine Enterprises in Tarnow, only some 
900 workers will remain, out of the 2,400 working there now. 
This is at least what is suggested in the program of 
restructurization and conversion prepared at a cost of 690,000 
German marks by the German company Cognos AG and the Institute 
of Organization and Management in Industry (ORGMASZ). 
  The arms industry is not guaranteed any social protection 
for 
the laid-off employees; therefore, it is hard to predict the 
course of practical implementation of the program of conversion 
to civilian production. 
  The Department of Defense Affairs in the Ministry of 
Industry 
and Trade has not revealed the expected costs of conversion of 
the defense industry as calculated for the entire industry 
branch. The scale of the financial needs is shown in the 
estimated data concerning the costs of the implementation of the 
program of restructurization and conversion in Tarnow. ORGMASZ 
estimates that this company will require approximately Z2 
trillion. Similar sums are also needed by other plants. 
However, it is no secret that there is no money in the budget. 
<H5>  Poor Ministry of National Defense] </H5>
  Over the past four years, the volume of Polish Army orders 
for the industry's products has decreased four times. Even 
though, during that time, the manpower of the Polish Army has 
decreased from 500,000 to fewer than 300,000, some experts say 
that the decrease in expenditures was relatively much larger 
than the reduction in manpower. 
  In 1990, MON [Minstry of National Defense] spent Z13.8 
trillion (in comparable prices) for new equipment and technical 
outfit. In 1993, the ministry could allocate for this purchase 
only Z3.4 trillion--that is, approximately 74 percent less. 
  This year's budget envisions Z47.1 trillion for MON. It was 
assumed that no more than Z4 trillion can be spent for 
purchases. In practice, this means several Orliks and 
approximately 10 Hard tanks. The purchae of two modern MiG-29 
fighter planes, of which we have too few to be able to defend 
ourselves effectively, would cost us approximately Z1.5 trillion. 
<H5>  To a Superior Instance </H5>
  MON, whose budget is less than modest, has not yet put in 
its 
full orders for 1994. The lack of orders from the Army, which 
made it impossible to begin the production process, was the 
indirect reason for the protest of union activists of the arms 
industry (staged on 6 May--the demonstration on the streets of 
Warsaw). Military officials who were present at the meeting with 
unionists at Skarzysko-Kamienna in early May of this year 
promised that 100 percent of the orders would have come to the 
factories by the end of this May. 
  The unionists also demand that the costs of maintaining RO 
from 1990 to 1991 (several billion zlotys) be returned to them; 
more specifically, they want the government to compensate the 
mutual debts of the arms industry, the budget, and the Social 
Security Agency. In 1992, the government earmarked 
approximately Z1 billions for RO; in 1993, a little more. The 
arms-producing factories claim that they must pay for the 
state's security with the money from their own, empty pockets. 
The arms industry merely managed to obtain compensation for the 
losses incurred as a consequence of the imposition of an embargo 
by the United Nations on Iraq and to retrieve some of the money 
for the equipment sold to the former Soviet Union. 
  Some more desperate factories, with a view to retrieving the 
money they lost through exports to the former Soviet Union, 
decided to sue the Government of Poland. In early March of this 
year, the Warsaw Rawar company won a trial case against the 
Office of the Council of Ministers [URM]. The company demands 
that the government give it back Z125 trillion, which Rawar lost 
after the Bielecki government broke the contracts with the 
Russians. URM has appealed the ruling.

  [Text] During today's news conference at Cotroceni Palace, 
Presidential Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu made several 
remarks on the open letter addressed to President Ion Iliescu by 
the Liberal Party '93 [PL'93] containing allegations against 
cabinet ministers. He pointed out that, in the absence of a law 
on ministerial responsibility, one cannot talk of legal 
proceedings unless proof can be supplied that a legally 
envisaged crime has been committed. Chebeleu said that the delay 
in submitting a law on the budget, due to objective conditions, 
cannot be considered a crime; therefore, one can only talk of 
political responsibility, at best. However, it is up to the 
Parliament to examine these aspects. 
  The presidential spokesman also denied rumors according to 
which the relations between President Ion Iliescu and Chamber of 
Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase have become cooler. He said 
that the current slander campaign against Nastase is politically 
motivated and aimed at weakening the government party. 
  In answer to another question, Chebeleu reiterated the hope 
that, after the elections in Hungary, the new government will 
adopt a realistic approach toward bilateral relations, thus 
removing the artificial tensions that have emerged in recent 
years.

  [Text] Regardless of the expected results, the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] is thinking in terms of a coalition 
government, MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn told MAGYAR HIRLAP. Gyula 
Horn pointed out that the Socialists will agree to govern alone 
if their partners get scared. Personally, Gyula Horn regards 
the position of prime minister as a great challenge; reacting to 
the reservations of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Horn 
said that the victorious party chairman is also usually given 
the prime minister's post according to West European practice. 
  [Szombathy] Leading SZDSZ politicians have recently 
indicated that the SZDSZ would not form a coalition with the 
MSZP if the party nominates you as prime minister. Will such 
messages affect your intentions? 
  [Horn] I find it strange that one of the opposition parties 
is dealing with such personnel combinations two weeks before the 
second round of elections. Let us wait for the election 
results, and then the distribution of posts can be part of the 
coalition talks. SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto visited me over the 
weekend and kindly expressed his sympathy regarding this... 
should I say?... accident of mine. Both Peto and other SZDSZ 
leaders expressed the view that, starting from the experience of 
the past four years, it would not be a good thing to have the 
party chairman also as prime minister. This was the basic 
objection of the Free Democrats. I answered that we constantly 
mention Western examples and a party chairman-prime minister set 
up prevails almost everywhere in the West, in the case of both 
social democratic and conservative governments. The head of the 
party that won the elections is generally the one who forms a 
government. Besides, this is an issue that we will have time to 
deal with after 29 May. 
  [Szombathy] Would you accept a possible nomination as prime 
minister? Do you have such ambitions? 
  [Horn] I have never asked for any position in my life; nor 
will I do so this time. If the MSZP decides to make me the 
candidate for prime minister, I will naturally accept this. 
This is a great challenge for anyone, and I have always liked 
challenges. One can only meet such a challenge with very tough 
and consistent work. Together with my party, I put my entire 
life at stake to see this country somehow prosper at long last. 
Hungary also suffers because there are few who care about 
others' problems. The past four years has shown the 
superabundance and harmful consequences of individual and 
personal ambitions. If I can live for the interest of this 
country, and we can do this, and if we can see to it that the 
overwhelming majority of our population live better, it would be 
a pity to reject such a task. 
  [Szombathy] Have you considered the possibility of forming a 
government of experts by obtaining an adequate majority, 
including experts of parties outside parliament? 
  [Horn] We have not thought of this, but essentially I 
support the idea of having two or three members in the next 
government who do not belong to any political party. This does 
not necessarily mean a government of experts; it only means the 
inclusion of figures that are professionals. One should not 
distribute the positions by mathematically counting the 
proportion of victors. I have an open mind on this issue. 
  [Szombathy] Could it happen that you become the Socialists' 
candidate for prime minister, but someone else becomes prime 
minister? 
  [Horn] We will not allow any of our partners to blackmail 
us. If the MSZP gets an absolute majority in parliament, the 
president will obviously ask us to form a government. I am 
almost certain that there will be no shortage of coalition 
partners. Regardless of the expected results, the MSZP thinks 
in terms of a coalition government. However, this does not mean 
a condition to which we stick by all means. If we get an 
absolute majority and there are no parties that, fearing a 
socialist imbalance, agree to form a coalition, the MSZP will 
accept governing responsibility alone. This is its duty because 
this is what it has worked for for four years! We have been 
struggling for the use of a better policy all the time. We 
would be deceiving the voters if we made a retreat with an 
absolute majority in Parliament. But the MSZP is a force that 
is acting responsibly. 
  [Szombathy] You said that there would be no shortage of 
partners. Why? What other party can you count on, except the 
SZDSZ? 
  [Horn] We are open toward every democratic force. At the 
same time, we do not want to cooperate in the next government 
with parties that are responsible for the current situation in 
Hungary, forces that lost the elections, and the current 
government coalition is such a force. I also said earlier that 
we are open to a Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] that 
gets rid of its extremists, although the KDNP is also 
responsible for the current situation. I continue to say that. 
As for the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], they should 
decide whether to continue the very extremist line of recent 
months or to do what they have done in Parliament very well for 
the past three years, namely followed a pragmatic policy based 
on a rational ability to evaluate things. If such debates take 
place in the Fidesz, we will naturally also be open to them. 
  [Szombathy] Would you accept a minority MSZP government if 
you fail to find a partner and you fail to obtain a majority? 
  [Horn] I do not think that we should accept forming a 
minority government, because I am convinced that we will have a 
partner even if we do not obtain an absolute majority. If the 
trend of 8 May continues, the MSZP needs very little to achieve 
very serious results.

  [Excerpt] Croatia's international position has recently 
improved significantly -- this conclusion was reached by Mate 
Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, the Croatian 
ambassadors to the United Nations, the European Union, the CSCE, 
and the Council of Europe, and by members of the Foreign Policy 
Committee of the Croatian Parliament's Chamber of 
Representatives. 
  [Correspondent] The Republic of Croatia has never been held 
in higher international esteem, says Minister Granic. There are 
no serious pressures from foreign countries. We have completely 
adjusted our position regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina to that of 
the international community. The Washington agreement is the 
foundation for future relations between the Croats and Muslims. 
Now that the Vienna agreement has been signed, there are no 
significant obstacles to the establishment of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  As regards the UN protected areas [UNPA's], the cease-fire 
agreement has been fully implemented by the Croatian side. We 
expect that the Serbian side will do the same. After that the 
talks on economic issues and, finally, on political issues 
should follow. 
  [Begin Granic recording] Our relations with Serbia are 
perhaps the only thing I would like to underline. If Serbia 
does not make its position regarding the UNPA's very clear, we 
will insist on the sanctions, in keeping with [UN Security 
Council] Resolution 871. There will be no meeting in Belgrade 
and I will not travel there until the agreed conditions are met.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the </F>
Yugoslav National Bank, by Dusko Petrovic, following reports 
that the FRY dinar has been listed on the foreign currency 
exchange list in USA TODAY; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Avramovic] That is great. Thank you for finding 
that report. It will help here for the people to realize that 
someone actually trusts us with something, after all the 
doubting Thomases we have here. Their mistrust is unfounded. 
But you see, there are other people who can see it from a 
distance and who can see that everything is all right. The 
minute I got here a magazine from Israel telephoned me asking 
for an explanation of all this, citing the article from THE 
ECONOMIST, you see. 
  [Petrovic] Can we expect an Israeli economic or financial 
magazine to publish soon an exchange list that will have our 
dinar on it? 
  [Avramovic] I am certain that this will go further. The 
next paper to carry it will be THE HERALD TRIBUNE. 
  [Petrovic] Can you please comment on the fact that this [USA 
TODAY] exchange list literally carries our exchange rate 
concerning the dollar, that is, the German mark? 
  [Avramovic] Yes, yes. Exactly. They have put here foreign 
currency [two words in English], it says 1.71 per dollar, which 
is our official exchange rate. The dollar has weakened against 
the German mark, so this is exactly right, according to parity. 
  [Petrovic] What does this mean in practical, concrete terms? 
  [Avramovic] In practice it means that we will most likely 
appear -- at this price, or very close to this price -- in 
exchange offices worldwide. This practically means that when 
you travel to Switzerland and so on, you will be able to go to 
the Union de Banque Suisse and sell your dinars there, and not 
at some scandalous price either. First it will appear, then 
there will be some margin, and then the margin will drop -- if 
everything continues to go well here. It also works the other 
way around. You will buy dinars there. They will become a 
thing to buy and sell in the world. That will solve the problem 
of the internal convertibility -- and I do not know who invented 
that -- that is stupid, you see. It is either convertible or 
not, it either has value or not. If it has value, then it has 
value both here and in Milan. If it has no value, then it has 
no value either here or in Milan. 
  Then soon, it will inevitably appear in Vienna, in Zurich, 
then it will appear in New York.

  [Text] Zvornik, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Serb Republic, and David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the Conference on Former Yugoslavia, 
had talks in Zvornik this evening. Their talks focused on the 
Geneva meeting between the ministers of foreign affairs of the 
United States, Russia, and the European Union, and the work of 
the contact group for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to a 
report broadcast this evening on the Serb TV-Sarajevo Studio, 
the Serbian side presented to the cochairmen its views on the 
resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina war and told them that the 
Muslims were continuing their spring offensive. The talks, 
which were also attended by Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the 
people's assembly of the republic of Srpska and Nikola Koljevic, 
vice president of the republic of Srpska were assessed as being 
very important and useful for the continuation of the peace 
process in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Patriarch of Moscow and 
All-Russia Aleksiy II, Serbian Patriarch Pavle, and Zagreb 
Archbishop Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, signed the Sarajevo 
declaration for peace at Sarajevo airport today. The 
declaration says: 
  It is high time to say that the nations in this area must no 
longer destroy each other and that such action aginst the life, 
rights, freedom and dignity of other nations is predominantly 
directed against one's own nation, against one's own 
grandfathers, fathers, sons and grandsons. It is high time one 
understood that it is only a peaceful and just solution of all 
conflicts and misunderstandings present in relations between 
nations in this area that can bring real happiness to people; 
their future will be salvaged only when we offer each other the 
possibility of living as we are accustomed and as our ancestors 
used to. It is time for us to recall that the present tragic 
conflict in the Balkans is a sin against every religion, because 
it is in no way compatible with any religious principles 
whatsoever. Taking advantage of religion for the sake of 
justifying hostility and divisions is an immoral and unlawful 
act. 
  True believing Christians and true believing Muslims are 
striving toward peace. This is their genuine desire and this is 
also in conformity with the Creator's commandments. And what 
can we do, we who believe in the one God? 
  We should and must pray and work and keep on believing that 
our prayers will be answered. We are also appealing to everyone 
in the world who believes in God to join us in our prayers for 
peace, and all those responsible for political decisions to 
re-examine their conscience before God and history. What will 
prevail and how can peace be attained? 
  May the Lord bestow peace, progress, wealth, and success in 
the pursuit of righteousness on all those divided today by 
deadly animosities.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Igor Blazevic; </F>
place and date not given: "Indifference to Violence Makes Me 
Angry"] 
  [Text] Igor Blazevic is a Saralian journalist and, among 
other things, is last year's recipient of the Frantisek Kriegel 
Prize, which is awarded by the Charter 77 Foundation. His 
interview with President Vaclav Havel, recorded at the beginning 
of May 1994, is being prepared for the Saralian magazine B-H 
DANI. Igor Blazevic offered the Czech version of the transcript 
to LIDOVE NOVINY and the English version to the INDEX ON 
CENSORSHIP magazine. 
  [Blazevic] Mr. President, despite the political risk, you 
have many times expressed an opinion on the Bosnian issue. You 
have made repeated calls for a more resolute stance by the 
international community toward Bosnia. Can you tell us why? 
  [Havel] There are three basic reasons that I air my views on 
this issue. I am firmly convinced that, in today's so 
manifoldly interconnected world, it is necessary to strengthen 
and systematically expand the feeling of universal 
responsibility. The fact that we are all actually responsible 
for the whole world applies not only in the case of military 
conflicts but also in ecology and many other spheres. I feel 
somewhat that the existence of an attitude of global 
responsibility is lacking in world politics. That is a kind of 
politico-philosophical reason. There is another more specific 
reason: The Czech Republic has had its own rather unfortunate 
historical experience of democracy's diminished ability to 
commit itself on behalf of the values that are intrinsic to it 
and upon which it is based. We saw this most explicitly in 
Munich. After the Munich diktat, Chamberlain said that he did 
not see why English boys should risk their lives for a far away 
country of which they knew little. We know the repercussions. 
The hope that human lives would be saved and the view that it 
is necessary to sacrifice some values in the name of peace 
turned out to be a sheer illusion. The result was the exact 
opposite. No lives were saved. In the end, many more were 
sacrificed. We can see certain parallels today, when the 
reluctance of the international community to enter more 
decisively into the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
throughout the former Yugoslavia may again have suicidal 
consequences, especially for Europe. The integrating Europe is 
founded on the principle of civic coexistence, the coexistence 
of different peoples, cultures, and religions. If, within an 
area that is an impermeable element of Europe's political 
actuality, these very values are in a brutal fashion being 
denied, trampled upon, and flouted in the name of nationalism 
and the principle of ethnic purity, this presents a direct 
threat to the values upon which Europe itself is based and upon 
which it is becoming integrated. The issue here does not involve 
mere solidarity with the suffering. It involves solidarity with 
one another because the principles for a secure life are 
endangered by indecision. The other reason lies, perhaps, in my 
character. I am simply one who gets angry about indifference to 
violence and lawlessness. 
  If I sometimes air my views on this issue, I have to say 
that 
it is always accompanied by a certain shamefacedness that I am 
not one who can enter more forcibly into the situation and, even 
less so, one who will risk his life; it is accompanied by the 
shamefacedness that I am not the one making the decisions, but 
that this role falls to the international community--the North 
Atlantic Alliance, the European Union, and the United Nations. 
It is a little peculiar if the person giving the advice is not 
the one to bear the consequences of his decisions. Of course, 
if we envisage an international operation with the involvement 
of many states, it is possible to consider a form of 
participation by a Czech unit. Nevertheless, it is easier for a 
person not directly involved in decisionmaking to give advice on 
something than it is for the person who will bear the 
consequences of that decision to decide. 
  However, it is true that, despite these moments of 
indecision, for some time now I have been pointing out, during 
various occasions on international forums, that the issue in 
Bosnia involves more than a local squabble, that it indeed 
involves the elementary values upon which not only European 
integration is based but upon which coexistence among people on 
the planet should be based in the future. Given the constantly 
increasing number of people on the planet, conflicts between 
nations or communities that feel their differentness with regard 
to others present a major threat, and that very differentness is 
the reason for conflicts. 
  [Blazevic] You have criticized the Geneva talks. In a joint 
statement with Slovene President Kucan, you said that it is 
necessary for the international community to redefine its 
political aim in Bosnia. Do you think there is still a 
requirement and opportunity to change this aim? 
  [Havel] I was made uneasy by the course of the Geneva talks. 
This unease grew with the impression that various uncontrollable 
warriors were capturing all sorts of territory and drawing 
different maps and that the Geneva conference was accepting 
their drawings, adopting them, and supplying and looking for 
maps of ethnic division that would suit all of the warring 
sides. I consider this to be a typical example of surrendering 
the defense of the values that should be the issue here. It 
created the impression that Karadzic was, in fact, suggesting to 
the Geneva negotiators the agenda for the negotiations. 
Therefore, I was quite skeptical; I was aware of a certain 
hypocrisy. 
  It was as if the Geneva talks were held merely so it could 
not be said that nothing was being done. At the same time, they 
were based on the very logical and fundamental argument that the 
warring sides must sit down at the negotiating table and that it 
is necessary to agree upon a truce and ultimately peace by 
peaceful means. Moreover, in fact, the negotiators acceded to 
something that should be intrinsically alien to the institutions 
at such negotiations. What I mean is that borders cannot be 
changed and states cannot be divided by force. In this case, it 
even involved an internationally recognized state. 
  At the same time, it is impossible to recognize a state 
within its existing borders and also conduct negotiations with 
uncontrollable armies on how it will be turned into several 
other states. 
  Nevertheless, it seems that, since then, the situation has 
moved forward a little. The concept of a Muslim-Croatian 
federation, which would enjoy a kind of confederal relationship 
with Croatia, is, it seems, accepted as a solution by the 
citizens. If it were possible to eventually involve the Serbs 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina in this federation as a recognized state 
and to restructure it on the federal principle--and I have grave 
doubts about this--this could be a way forward. We ourselves 
know what it is like to be two nations that sense their 
individuality and try to express it in a specific constitutional 
and legal manner. We tried to establish a just federation, 
which, as you know, did not succeed. So, we decided to separate 
by peaceful means. I understand that peoples here and there 
want to have their own state; I am not so lacking in 
understanding. There is a great deal of intermingling and 
affinity among the communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
network of coexistence here was so rich that division on the 
ethnic principle would never end. Each home, each family, and 
each village could draw a border. This is simply dragging 
things out ad absurdum. 
  [Blazevic] Following your meeting with Lord Owen, you said 
that your views were not entirely harmonious. I would rather 
say that your views are entirely unharmonious. For many 
Bosnians, Lord Owen has become the symbol of a hesitant and 
pragmatic policy without vision. On the other hand, you, Mr. 
President, have become the symbol of a politician who insists on 
values but seems a little like a dissident who can raise his 
voice repeatedly but cannot fundamentally influence the 
decisions on "major" policy. Would you comment on this? 
  [Havel] First of all, let me speak about Lord Owen. We 
indeed agreed that we have a somewhat different view. This does 
not mean that I do not respect him. This is a man who has good 
intentions and who has expended a great deal of energy. 
Nevertheless, I have very grave doubts about the road he is 
following. 
  When he was here, we had a very friendly conversation. He 
said that he was going to Belgrade, where he wanted to meet 
President Milosevic, Karadzic, and others and that he wanted to 
conduct another dialogue with them from which something could be 
expected. This reminded me a little of the illusion that it is 
possible to convince a nondemocrat of something by charm alone. 
This is what Munich and Lord Runciman remind us of. The latter 
also had good intentions and came here to see how he could 
reconcile us with Hitler. 
  This does not mean I am placing an equal sign between anyone 
and Hitler, of which, as I read, I am suspected of doing. I 
have even been suspected of being an enemy of the Serbian 
people. That is absolute nonsense. The very opposite is true: 
I disapprove of any kind of collective condemnation of nations, 
and I cannot be, from my very marrow, an enemy of any nation. I 
am the enemy of certain policies and certain actions taken by 
the Serbian leadership, especially Karadzic's Bosnian-Serb 
leadership. I condemn violence, fanaticism, and brutality. I 
do not condemn any nation, however. 
  As far as my position is concerned, of course, I am not the 
one who will make the decisions. Nevertheless, I think that 
each voice has its own significance. When a person is a 
president, albeit of a small state that does not make decisions, 
his voice may perhaps be listened to more than if he were a 
private individual. And it makes sense to repeat certain 
things. I was criticized a year ago for recommending a more 
emphatic approach by the international community; it ultimately 
adopted this approach. It may have been a year later and, 
again, it was a little inconsequential, imperfect, and 
befuddled; nevertheless, it happened. I do not think this was 
because I made a statement a year ago. However, many people 
referred to this situation, and newspapers throughout Europe and 
America again and again subjected the indecisive and befuddled 
policy to critical reflection. This, undoubtedly, had an 
influence on the decision to issue threats of an air strike, 
whether in Sarajevo or later around Gorazde. In this instance, 
it was, of course, a little ambiguous. 
  [Blazevic] The democratically oriented people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina who were in favor of a multi-ethnic state now 
feel defeated by the nationalists and fascists. At the same 
time, they feel betrayed by the Western democracies. 
  [Havel] I absolutely understand these feelings, and I know 
that, apart from the three warring sides, there is a powerful 
fourth side here--the side that does not want a war and that 
does not feel the need for confrontation among the individual 
ethnic groups. I am on the side of these people. However, 
whenever we say that someone has betrayed us, and when we are 
angry at someone, we have to associate this with certain 
self-reflection. After all, the leaders of the current conflict 
were once elected by someone. Karadzic was elected as the 
representative of a certain side in elections in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Society must reflect on its own mistakes or 
breakdowns and not only shoulder all the responsibility onto 
others. 
  [Blazevic] When you speak about Bosnia--now, however, we are 
speaking not only about Bosnia--do you perceive a conflict 
between Havel the intellectual and Havel the politician? 
  [Havel] I admit that this issue perhaps bothers certain 
commentators more than it bothers me. I do not feel that it is 
such a major problem. Fate has placed me in a role in which I 
must express my views--which I would have even if I were not 
president--in a manner corresponding to the responsibility 
arising from my position. I often have to choose other words, 
perhaps more diplomatic or cautious words, but I have to remain 
true to myself and say what I really think. I accept this as a 
new challenge and as a task that I am faced with, a task with 
which I have to come to terms. This is nothing new because life 
and fate have always confronted me with all sorts of strange 
tasks. And, perhaps, their novelty will, to a certain extent, 
encourage and provoke me into performing them.

<F P=106> [Article by Ryszard Zabinski: "Grzegorz Kolodko, or </F>
Production and Investment"] 
  [Text] Poland Anno Domini 1990 was the first historical 
example of a country moving from socialism to capitalism. We 
became a quite unique experimental laboratory for a variety of 
advisers like Jeffrey Sachs. But there was too high a price to 
pay for some of those experiments--in the form of the collapse 
of many state enterprises, extensive unemployment, and so on. 
  That is, more or less, the line of reasoning adopted by 
Grzegorz Kolodko, the new "father" of our economy. Does it 
signify a departure from the liberalism represented by the 
Gdansk school--that is, the policy we have attempted to put in 
practice for the past four years? 
  Grzegorz Kolodko has a long-term concept of our future 
economic development. As a fertile publicist and author, he 
often presented and interpreted his vision for the public's 
benefit. It must be admitted that, despite the passage of 
years, his program has remained almost unchanged and is still 
very good. 
  However, we still have many legitimate doubts as to whether 
he will be able to translate it into practical terms. The 
foundation of his idea is rapid production growth, which should 
in turn cause an increase in the national income. In the next 
four years, production should grow by as much as 26 percent and 
national income by 23 percent (that is, approximately 5.6 
percent annually). 
  We should be able to achieve this through exports, the 
development of the economic infrastructure (transport and 
communications), and an inexpensive housing-construction 
program. At the same time, as we carry out major capital 
investment projects, we should achieve a reduction of 
unemployment figures. 
  Exports should be the number-one priority. They are the 
principal economic growth tool of any state that wants to become 
an economic tiger. The state must support exports through 
credit guarantees, export tax and tariff concessions, the 
development of free trade zones, and so on. 
  The development of the infrastructure is achieved primarily 
through building superhighways and investing in the growth of 
telecommunications networks. As regards the first of these 
goals, Poland would find its chief opportunity by joining in the 
EEC Growth Initiative Scheme. I will deliberately avoid 
discussing the question of housing construction here because 
this sector was supposed to serve as the main "flywheel" of the 
Polish economy ever since the Gierek era. 
  There is no doubt that a program that places such strong 
emphasis on capital investment and production is bound to be 
very expensive. Who is going to pay for it? Any major budget 
deficit will be made good through the issuance of special State 
Treasury bonds. It is envisaged that a system of incentives 
(based on special tax allowances) will be introduced here to 
encourage the public to buy these bonds. 
  Another method, the simplest, would be to increase taxation 
rates. However, Grzegorz Kolodko proposes an alternative 
solution here: to increase the number of taxpayers in the 
country by, among other things, bringing the economic "gray 
zone" into the open and subjecting it to the normal fiscal 
regulations and obligations. Consequently, we can expect to see 
the introduction of many radical measures in this area. I must 
admit that this element of Kolodko's program raises the greatest 
doubts in observers' minds. If it does not succeed, which could 
happen very easily, we will have to review that section of the 
whole program quite radically and burden honest taxpayers with 
the obligation to help with the budget deficit. 
  The expected deepening of the budget deficit will not be 
the result of more money having been pumped into the so-called 
budget-funded sectors of the economy (administration, education, 
health service, and so on), so the latter will not benefit from 
it at all. Instead of linking their pay increases to the 
inflation rate and reviewing their pay structure, they will be 
offered alternative compensatory pay in the form of 
"zero-interest" State Treasury bonds, which, however, will be 
index-linked to the movement of production prices. 
  An additional source of budget revenues should come from, 
among other things, increased excise charges, the introduction 
of border duty (approximately $10-15 per person for crossing the 
state border), and the introduction of stock market tax for all 
investors. 
  This last idea entails a particular risk because the 
proposed 
stock market tax would not be charged on individual transactions 
but on stock market investment gains. Such an unfortunate move 
would doubtless scare investors away from the stock market and 
induce them to place their money in, say, the bonds and 
securities market. I strongly suspect that that is what the new 
deputy prime minister is after: to get people to make good--at 
least partly--the budget deficit by buying State Treasury 
securities. 
  Kolodko's concepts are not presented in the form of an 
official document. Nothing has yet been decided beyond the 
possibility of change. They are simply the new prime minister's 
views on the state economy, but he will doubtless set about 
putting them into practice. 
  The economic reforms of the past four years have been 
implemented under the motto of liberalization of the market; the 
next four years are supposed to be devoted to the goals of 
production and investment. However, it is quite likely that 
this program will prove too hard on employees and workers of the 
budget-funded sectors of the economy. The populists will still 
have a good chance of acceding to positions of power on the 
pretext of creating the mythical "third way."

  [Text] Tirana, May 17 (ATA) -- President Sali Berisha met 
on May 16 with president of Kosova Ibrahim Rugova. They 
discussed the conditions in which the Albanian nation is at 
present, the grave situation in Kosova and the development of 
democratic reforms in Albania, the President's Press and 
Information Office reports. 
  Both presidents were of the opinion that the establishment 
of 
dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade, in the presence of a 
third party is imperative for the measures to normalize the life 
and for a political solution of the Kosova issue. 
  They pointed out that the stability and the independence of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] are 
important for the peace and stability of Albanians and other 
nationalities of the Balkans. They encourage the Albanian 
political forces to cooperate with each other for the 
consolidation of the stability of the Macedonian Republic as 
well as for a guarantee of the human rights and freedoms of the 
Albanians as a condition for the stability of this republic. 
The meeting was conducted in a spirit of full understanding.

Ministry" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, May 17 (ATA) -- A report by the spokesman 
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Albania 
issued on May 16 says that the Albanian Foreign Ministry 
expresses the satisfaction for the fact that the Albanian 
proposal for a forthcoming Albanian-Greek meeting in Tirana, has 
had a positive response from the Greek foreign minister, 
Papoulias. The report adds that the freedom and the rights of 
the Greek minority in Albania are and will be guaranteed and 
invulnerable. This reality of the Greek minority in Albania has 
been acknowledged and esteemed by relevant international 
organizations as well. 
  The Albanian deputy foreign minister, Arjan Starova, had a 
meeting on May 13 with the ambassador of the Greek Republic in 
Tirana, Mr. Tsalikis. He forwarded the Albanian proposal for a 
meeting in Tirana between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries. Such an idea was expressed some days ago by the 
president of Albania, Sali Berisha, in an interview with the 
Albanian Radio and Television at the end of his visit to Romania 
last week.

  [Text] Sofia, May 13 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Berov today 
submitted in parliament the intentions of his cabinet till the 
end of 1994 which are to be realized by a new government team. 
The intentions, received at BTA, fall into three stages -- 
May-June, July-September and October-December. The prime 
minister warned that the government would resign if parliament 
fails to pass a package of important laws by the end of June. 
  The government will observe its agreements with the 
international financial institutions on anti-inflation and 
monetary restrictions but this would not suffice to create 
conditions for economic recovery. That is why the government 
intends to use market mechanisms in encouraging entrepreneurship 
while a more active investment policy for encouraging individual 
productions could be provided for in the draft budget for 1995. 
  According to the prime minister, the annual inflation in 
1994 
will be lower than that in 1993. Adhering to the principles set 
forth in its programme declaration of December 30, 1992 (when it 
was elected), the government will continue its strict 
restrictive policy to curb inflation. 
  The measures which the government will take against 
speculative pricing eating away the incomes of the population 
will include confiscation of proven speculative profit in favour 
of the national budget. 
  By the end of May the government shall adopt measures to 
protect local producers against dumping imports from some 
countries as well as a stand for its tariff negotiations with 
Turkey, the United States, Canada and other countries. 
  By the end of June the government shall adopt a national 
programme for combating crime which, however, will come into 
force after the passing of a Judiciary Act. At the same time 
the Council of Ministers will support temporary restoration of 
capital punishment or its alternative. 
  The Council of Ministers will also move in parliament a 
simplified design of a state coat of arms strictly conforming 
with the respective text in the Constitution and without any 
monarchist symbols. 
  Following the inflation processes, the government will 
continue to implement its decrees on cost of living adjustments 
concerning minimum wages, pensions, minimum incomes for public 
relief and compensation of wage funds in enterprises of majority 
state holding. The Council of Ministers will continue its 
cooperation with its social partners in the Tripartite Council. 
  The negotiations with the European Union on the loan for 
financing Bulgaria's balance of payments and with the World Bank 
should be held by June 15. Together with the National Bank of 
Bulgaria (BNB) the government shall draft the foreign debt deal 
and a special unit shall be set up to manage the national debt. 
Negotiations with the IMF on additional funding of the debt deal 
are forthcoming. 
  By the end of May the Finance Ministry will establish strict 
control over the worst loss-makers. It will introduce a system 
sharply increasing the amount of collected budget revenues. 
  The Industry Ministry will adopt and assess the programmes 
for financial rehabilitation and restructuring of state-owned 
enterprises, after which they will be divided into three groups: 
profitable units, loss-makers and enterprises which must be put 
into liquidation. Thirty-four state-owned industrial 
enterprises will be wound up. 
  By mid-June the cabinet will be approving the action plans 
of 
the largest enterprises, which cannot be privatized as yet, such 
as the Neftokhim oil refinery, the Kremikovtsi Metallurgical 
Works, Bulgargas, etc. The cabinet will require their 
managements to make progress reports. Eleven enterprises 
subordinated to the Council of Ministers are expected to be 
privatized by the end of June. 
  By May 15 the minister of labour and social affairs will 
have to submit to the cabinet a report on the goals of the 
reform in social insurance. The Ministry of Labour and Social 
Affairs will give priority to the drawing up of projects for 
adjusting incomes to inflation. 
  The Transport Ministry will carry through a deal for the 
privatization of the SO MAT international road haulier according 
to a cabinet-approved scheme, and will continue work on the 
privatization of 68 more transport enterprises and 12 units. 
Talks will continue with potential investors in the 
privatization of the national air carrier Balkan Airlines. 
Projects will be drawn up for the border checkpoints in Vidin, 
Ruse, Kulata and Gyueshevo, financed by the PHARE [Economic and 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme and the 
governments of the United States and Sweden. Tenders will be 
organized for the construction of a tunnel under the Shipka 
Peak, as well as for the development of the ports of Burgas (on 
the Black Sea) and Ruse (on the Danube). Deals for the 
privatization of nine enterprises are expected to be completed. 
150 km of road will be renewed between July and September and 
the construction of a railway link between Bulgaria and 
Macedonia [the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
will start. 
  The cabinet will propose to the parliamentary groups 
supporting it to sign a framework agreement on the passage of 
urgently needed legislation. The Council of Ministers will do 
its best for parliament to pass, by the end of June, amendments 
to the Privatization Act; a Scheme of Composition Act; a 
Bankruptcy Act; to approve the final structure of the foreign 
debt deal with a view to the ratification of the signed deal and 
agreements on balance-of- payments financing and financing for 
the foreign debt deal. 
  Unless this legislation passes by the fixed time limit, it 
will be impossible for the government to carry on and it will 
resign. 
  The government will seek to finalize agreements on 
additional 
financing for the foreign debt deal between July and September. 
Budget utilization will be analyzed during this period and 
amendments are to be expected while the parameters of the 
projected budget deficit will remain unchanged, the document 
says. Additional funds will be appropriated to certain 
departments, giving priority to the army, should the collected 
budget revenues allow this, Prof. Berov said. 
  A list of 500 enterprises due for mass privatization will be 
published upon the passage of amendments to the Privatization 
Act. Privatization vouchers will be printed by July 17, and 
subscription for them will end on August 18, the cabinet says in 
its programme. 
  Between July and September the Trade Ministry should carry 
out its duties under the law on the settlement of non-performing 
loans contracted by December 31, 1990. The Industry Ministry 
should adopt a programme for company rehabilitation and 
restructuring. During that period a second group of loss-making 
state-owned enterprises will be proposed for liquidation. 
  The government will be implementing the land reform by a new 
flexible system combining land lease and cooperatives in view of 
the unwillingness of many owners to cultivate the land, the 
document says. The government will seek ways to provide support 
to part of the farmers from internal bank resources and from the 
expected U.S. financing to the amount of $50 million. 60 
percent of the land claimed by its owners has been returned in 
real boundaries and through land distribution plans, the 
document says. 300 more plans for the distribution of 430,000 
hectares of land will be approved in the second quarter. Over 
72 percent of the land will be returned to its owners by the 
year's end, the document says. 
  The Health Ministry will have to carry through the 
restructuring of the network of health care establishments. 
  The Defence Ministry is to put off until September personnel 
and structural changes among senior officers in view of the 
critical situation in the Balkans. 
  The government attaches great importance to the performance 
of the Finance Ministry in the last quarter of 1994. It is 
assigned to draft a 1995 agreement with the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  The Privatization Agency is expected to conclude 70 deals 
worth 5,000 million leva by the year's end. 
  Foreign investment to the amount of 2,700 million leva is 
expected to be channeled into the country through joint ventures 
subordinated to the Industry Ministry. Twenty-six privatization 
deals are expected to yield some 400 million leva in proceeds. 
If the Industry Ministry accomplishes its programme, industrial 
output can be expected to rise 2-3 percentage points from 1993 
at comparable prices.

  [Text] Prague, May 13 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
admitted today that the issue of the Temelin nuclear power plant 
in south Bohemia, some 80 kilometers from the Austrian border, 
complicated Czech-Austrian relations. Klaus made his remarks at 
a meeting with Austrian Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek. Busek had 
stressed the sensitivity of the question for Austrian citizens, 
Klaus told journalists. 
  "On the other hand the vice-chancellor is also aware that 
the 
Czech power situation is not easy, no easy solutions exist and 
that the issue cannot be allowed to complicate and hamper future 
Czech-Austrian relations," Klaus said. 
  He said he discussed with Busek measures aimed at the 
revival 
of mutual relations, including those on an official level. He 
pointed to his planned visit to the Salzburg festival in August 
at which he could meet several Austrian politicians. Klaus 
stressed that Czech and Austrian views on many European problems 
were "very close."

  [Text] Vienna/Prague, May 15 (CTK) -- Czech Trade and 
Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told the Austrian news agency 
APA today he welcomed the statement by Austrian Vice-Chancellor 
Erhard Busek that the Austrian Government considered the issue 
of completion of the Temelin power plant "closed." Austrian 
(and Czech) environmentalists, supported by political parties, 
have been strongly protesting against Temelin's completion. The 
Soviet-type plant, to be equipped with Westinghouse safety 
technology, is located about 100km from the Austrian border. 
  "I have known this position of Busek for several weeks. It 
was reiterated during our working breakfast on Friday morning 
[13 May]," Dlouhy said. Busek, who has attended the Prague 
international conference Europe and Us, told the APA after the 
talks with Premier Vaclav Klaus that he understood that the 
energy situation of the Czech Republic did not give the country 
any option but to complete the Temelin plant. 
  Dlouhy said that the Czech Republic was refusing the 
Austrian 
proposals to convert the Temelin plant to the use of gas "simply 
because it would be too expensive." He pointed to the fact that 
Austria, too, had refused on economic grounds to rebuild the 
finished Zwentendorf nuclear plant to gas fuel. 
  He expressed the doubts that the "atomic" law, which was 
being prepared, could delay the Temelin completion. "Quite the 
reverse. The government bill makes it possible to continue in 
the construction works, planned in Temelin for 1994- 1995," 
Dlouhy said. The government is trying to finish the law before 
the Temelin plan is commissioned. The parliament could approve 
the "atomic law" during 1995, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Sophia Coudenhove: "Seven Presidents Strive for </F>
Unity"] 
  [Text] Litomysl, east Bohemia--Their mission was to 
redefine Central Europe. Their powers were practically nil. But 
the seven presidents meeting in the provincial town of Litomysl 
may have achieved more than anyone could have expected. 
  The meeting brought Austria, Germany and Slovenia into the 
Central European fold, a step toward regional integration that 
went beyond the traditional--and unpopular--Visegrad Four 
countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
  Former Czech Premier Petr Pithart said that this strengthens 
the Central European case for European unity by demonstrating 
the countries' ability to cooperate. He said the meeting was an 
important signal to Western Europe that the countries are ready 
to work with each other and with the West. 
  "Of course," Pithart said, "it matters to Europe whether a 
lone rider shows up or whether it's a group that is prepared to 
solve even those problems that seem unsolvable." 
  In a 90-minute televised debate, the presidents discussed 
regional cooperation, alluding to Russia, the Balkans and 
integration to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
European Union. Most of the debate, however, was devoted to 
mutual declarations of friendship, cooperation and goodwill. 
  While Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and others have 
criticized Visegrad on the grounds that it classifies a group of 
countries as a whole rather than recognizing their individuality 
and differing rates of progress, the Litomysl meeting showed the 
Visegrad Four's ability to work together without forcing them 
into a single category. 
  Though concrete results were insubstantial, supporters of 
the 
meeting said this did not matter because the presidents' aims 
were broad and long-term. 
  "From experience, I know how important and underrated 
personal meetings are," said Pithart. "The more meetings there 
are, the better relations can be and the more problems can be 
avoided in the future. Obviously, that applies even if people 
aren't affected straightaway." 
  The predominance of ceremony and symbolism, however, did not 
keep the presidents away from more topical issues. For 
instance, Slovenian President Milan Kucan said that Western 
Europe had made critical errors in not understanding that the 
Yugoslav Federation was bound to fall apart. 
  Additionally, all the leaders vehemently rejected Russian 
attempts to exert influence over Central Europe, even through 
the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace. "Russia does not 
want to be a partner and does not understand what partnership 
is," said Polish President Lech Walesa, the most outspoken of 
the group. 
  Richard von Weizsacker said that while the West wanted to 
cooperate with--rather than provoke--Russia, it would not do so 
on terms dictated by Moscow. Czech President Vaclav Havel 
stressed the importance of categorically rejecting any claim 
that "Russia has a special right to advise us on what we may and 
may not do." 
  The televised debate was moderated by French political 
scientist and historian Jacques Rupnik, who accidentally 
overlooked Slovak President Michal Kovac in the first round of 
questions. 
  Klaus, who along with Czech parliamentary Chairman Milan 
Uhde, declined an invitation to dine with the presidents April 
15--an invitation they had previously accepted--said that the 
meeting broke down barriers between East and West and rectified 
the impression often given by the media that there is little 
understanding among some of the countries involved. 
  On a local level, the meeting was perhaps the biggest event 
to hit the 10,000-inhabitant town of Litomysl since the birth of 
its favorite son, composer Bedrich Smetana. Portraits and 
biographies of the presidents hung in store windows--Havel's was 
in a bookshop, Kovac's at a travel agency--and thousands of 
supporters clamored to see them. 
  "It's a huge honor that this is happening in our town," said 
Jan Schejbal, who works at the Zlata hvezda hotel, where Havel 
spent the second night of his stay. "Seeing top-level politics 
before our eyes makes us feel that we're a part of them, too. It 
brings us up to a higher level, and it makes us forget our own 
problems." 
  The presidents of the seven countries are to meet again in 
Hungary next year and in Poland in 1996.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Bonn, Vienna, London: Klaus </F>
Usually Knocks on Western Doors"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' recent visit to Moscow 
was a rare exception to the rule that has guided Czech foreign 
policy since 1992: "Go West, Mr. Prime Minister." The April 4-5 
trip was the first time the Czech prime minister has set foot in 
a former Soviet republic since his party gained control in the 
1992 elections. 
  Out of Klaus' 52 trips abroad as prime minister, 37 have 
been 
to Western countries. His visits to Germany outnumber those he 
has made to the Czech Republic's fellow Visegrad 
countries--Poland, Slovakia and Hungary--combined. His scheduled 
trip next week to the far-flung capitals of Argentina, Chile and 
Brazil, to foster commercial contacts, is an even more unusual 
departure from his usual Western itinerary. 
  Klaus has been singled out for criticism in the Central 
European press for his alleged neglect of the Visegrad countries 
and his generally non-cooperative and competitive relationship 
with them. 
  "It's not true," Klaus shot back in an interview with the 
daily LIDOVE NOVINY, published April 8. "I meet with Polish 
politicians more than anyone else." 
  But the fact that Klaus has made three official visits to 
Poland as prime minister--and has met with Polish government 
representatives both here and in other countries--is 
overshadowed by the overall pro-Western drive of his government. 
  "The orientation of the Czech Republic is clear," said Jan 
Zahradil, a foreign advisor for Klaus' Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS). "It's our aim to get into the Western European 
structures, so of course the frequency of visits [to the West] 
would be higher than, say, to Hungary or Poland." 
  As might be expected, Germany tops Klaus' destination list 
with 13 official, unofficial and working visits in the past 21 
months. Second on the list is Austria, with five visits. In 
comparison, the closest he has come to visiting an Asian or 
Middle Eastern country was a three-day working trip to Israel in 
February. He has visited the Czech Republic's fellow Visegrad 
countries a combined total of eight times. 
  The unabashed pro-Western push of Klaus' foreign policy was 
apparent even in his seemingly less important visit to Finland 
last month. "Finland is important because it's waiting to get 
into the European Union. So Mr. Klaus sent there to see how the 
preparations are getting along. To see it with his own eyes," 
said Zahradil. 
  The prime minister's trip to Russia caused a minor stir in 
Moscow. The Izvestia news agency requested an article from him 
on economic reform, and he gave a well-attended lecture at a 
Moscow university on systemic reform in former communist 
countries. When it was all over, Klaus walked away with a 
promise from the Russian side to sign an agreement within two 
months on paying off its $3.4 billion debt to the Czech 
Republic. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said his 
country can learn something from the Czech experience. 
  But even in this cheery diplomatic setting, Klaus made it 
clear that he was mainly in the East to collect debt from the 
Russians, not to work out any sort of alliance. The closest he 
came to officially complimenting Russian leaders was to say that 
he "found the political and economic situation a bit more stable 
than anticipated." 
  By contrast, a Russian television report on Klaus' life was 
filled with compliments. "Klaus is a born polemicist, armed with 
well-considered arguments, erudition and irony as well." 
  It is clear that there is also a personal dimension to the 
government's strongly Western policy. Klaus seems far more 
comfortable in the company of Western leaders and business 
people; his visits to Western countries don't necessarily have 
to hold a direct political or economic aim. 
  Last month, he personally brought a huge bouquet of flowers 
to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and stood 
beaming beside her as camera shutters clicked. "They are very 
good friends," said Lucie Weissova, a journalist for Czech Radio 
who occasionally covers Klaus' trips abroad. "He couldn't let 
this meeting go by. They agree on everything." Later, Klaus 
wrote a lovingly nostalgic article for LIDOVE NOVINY about 
London and British right-wing politics, titled "English 
Conservatism Is Close to Us." 
  But Klaus doesn't let politics get in the way of good 
relations with important Western neighbors. So when Rudolf 
Scharping, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party and a 
strong candidate for German chancellor, passed through Prague, 
he met with both Klaus and President Vaclav Havel. 
  The ODS' Zahradil said this is an honor not afforded most 
other countries' opposition party leaders during an election 
year. However, since Scharping might be the leader of the Czech 
Republic's most important economic partner by year's end, usual 
procedures were waived. 
  When deciding which countries to pay an official visit to, 
the Klaus government has the advantage of a world-renowned 
president in Havel. So while the prime minister has never been 
to Asia, Havel has. Other politically problematic invitations, 
from countries such as Syria or Iran, are normally given to 
other government ministers or deputy ministers, Zahradil said. 
  But as far as Western Europe is concerned, 
invitations--whether to meet a head of state or to visit a 
university for an honorable doctorate--are always given special 
consideration. "One of the aims of the Czech Republic is to 
have good relations with all our neighbors," said Zahradil. "Of 
course, Hungary isn't as important as Germany."

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Feuding Over a Senate That Only a </F>
Few Seem to Want"] 
  [Text] The very same political leaders who made an 
81-member Senate part of the Czech constitution now seem to be 
wondering why anyone would have done such a thing. Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus, who in 1992 lauded the new constitution 
as "superstable," now calls the Senate wasteful and claims he 
would have fought against its inclusion if he wasn't so busy 
working on the split of Czechoslovakia. Klaus' Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS) played a dominant role in drafting the constitution 
and getting it approved. 
  President Vaclav Havel says he only supports the Senate 
because it's in the constitution. The opposition parties are 
absolutely opposed to it. 
  Originally conceived as a basis for a stable democratic 
system and a possible compromise post for outgoing deputies of 
the Czechoslovak federal parliament, it has now become a thorn 
in the side of the political establishment. 
  Despite the lack of political will to establish a Senate, 
the 
upper chamber seems firmly on its way to being formed in 
late-1994 elections. 
  The three small parties that ensure Klaus' coalition 
government a majority in parliament are pushing for a Senate 
electoral system that will benefit non-mainstream parties by 
having three representatives elected from each district. 
Although he says he would rather not deal with the issue, Klaus 
is holding out for a one-senator-per-district system that will 
clearly benefit his popular Civic Democratic Party (ODS). 
  The issue has rocked the four-party governing coalition with 
stormy meetings and no easy resolution in sight. 
  The origin of the Senate dates back to late 1992, when the 
federation was falling apart. Federal parliamentary deputies 
agreed to vote themselves out of their jobs, as long as they 
could be included in a new Czech Senate or have some other 
political function. 
  When the Czech National Council--by then the supreme 
elective 
body of the new independent country--turned around and voted the 
proposal down, Klaus seemed to favor the inclusion of federal 
deputies in a new Senate. Instead, the federal deputies were 
sent packing, and the Senate remained nothing but a few lines in 
the new country's constitution. 
  In a regular Sunday radio address, Havel said the 
constitution should be upheld at all costs but couldn't help 
adding that he has "never been a friend of the bicameral 
parliamentary system." As president, Havel has roughly the same 
powers that a Senate would have under the Czech constitution--if 
it existed. 
  According to article 46 of the constitution, the Senate can 
veto laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies, the existing lower 
house of parliament. However, as in the case of a presidential 
veto, the lower chamber can override the decision with a simple 
majority vote. Apart from that, the Senate can do little. It 
has no say on budgetary matters and cannot adopt constitutional 
laws, election laws or international agreements. 
  Politicians from both the government and opposition ranks 
have questioned the need to spend more money in order to set up 
such a weak upper chamber in a relatively homogeneous country of 
10 million. 
  The opposition Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) has 
proposed that the Senate be abolished from the constitution 
altogether. "It's too expensive for our state and wasteful for 
our parliamentary democracy," said CSSD deputy Eva Fischerova. 
"We don't think it's necessary." 
  No cost estimate exists for the new body, according to 
Miroslav Havel of the Finance Ministry. "For now," he said, 
"they can all philosophize at the political level, but we don't 
have any figures [on how much] it will all cost yet."

<F P=106> [Article by Sophia Coudenhove: "National Union Congress </F>
Displays Egoism, Hatred--and a New Leader"] 
  [Text] Less than 24 hours after being voted head of the 
Czech Republic's trade unions, a sad and tired Richard Falbr 
said he already envied his predecessor for having quit the post. 
After supporting him with an overwhelming majority, the 
Congress of the Czech and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions 
(CMKOS) spent almost six hours furiously debating whether Falbr, 
his deputy and the members of the CMKOS management committee 
should be screened for possible association with the 
communist-era secret police (StB). 
  "In a way, this congress has been a reflection of the 
situation in this country," Falbr said in his closing speech. 
"It would be hard to find as much egoism and hate as has arisen 
in this room in the last two hours, and I'm very sorry about 
that." 
  The whole issue of screening had barely come up at all until 
just before the vote, when Falbr told delegates that in his 
early 20s, he had taught Spanish and English at the Interior 
Ministry and might therefore appear on a list of alleged StB 
collaborators. He denied ever having signed anything for the 
secret police. "If these personal attacks on me continue, I 
will re-evaluate my continuation in this position," Falbr said. 
  Eventually delegates voted that their leaders should be 
screened, but not made to resign if the results were positive. 
And while union members hurled insults at each other across the 
congress hall, sometimes whistling and swearing, leaders cringed 
as they remembered that one of the aims of the meeting had been 
to show unity and cooperation for the future. 
  Although the congress succeeded in drawing up a 
constitution, 
a program for the next four years and an outline of their 
current demands, Falbr and his colleagues will face discord and 
confusion on more than merely personal fronts. 
  Falbr's greatest challenge remains bridging the gap between 
members who favor the moderate approach to the government that 
has so far prevailed, and those who would prefer to take more 
radical steps. 
  The country's transition to a market democracy has deprived 
workers of many privileges they enjoyed under communism. Union 
leaders have generally accepted these changes, causing 
opposition among many rank-and-file members. 
  Outside labor circles, the government and much of the Czech 
media has labeled the unions as "extremists," often comparing 
them to their communist predecessors. 
  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus is among those most eager to 
condemn the unions. At the opening of the congress March 8, he 
did not hesitate to connect the unions' activities with their 
supposed political beliefs. 
  Referring to a speech given by Falbr's predecessor Vladimir 
Petrus at the March 22 union demonstration on Old Town Square, 
Klaus denied Petrus' allegations that employees were made to 
feel superfluous in the workplace. "I don't believe that this is 
the dominant feeling among union members," Klaus said, "except 
perhaps those who during the communist era got used to the fact 
that little was demanded of them at work." 
  Although Klaus' remark was met with whistles at the 
congress, 
Petrus was quick to forgive his previous attacks. Brushing aside 
Klaus' earlier comparison of the demonstration to the 1948 
communist coup, he said that the prime minister's presence at 
the congress could be considered as an apology. 
  Meanwhile, Falbr, while promising that he would take a more 
radical approach than Petrus, failed to specify what form this 
new radicalism would take. 
  Asked about parliament's and President Vaclav Havel's 
approval of the new labor code, against which the unionists had 
demonstrated, Falbr said that while he was not happy with the 
law, he understood that it would have been difficult for Havel 
to pit himself against the entire government coalition by not 
signing it. 
  Of all the speakers at the congress, the foreign 
representatives made the strongest attacks on the Czech 
government. 
  The head of the International Confederation of Free Unions, 
Enzo Friso, said that Czech politicians, especially Klaus, still 
had a lot to learn about democracy. And Andreas Botsch, a 
representative of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), said that if the Czech government was 
interested in entering the organization, it would have to bear 
in mind that the OECD binds its members to dialogue with trade 
unions.

<F P=106> [Article by Lubomir Sedlak: "Transport Ministry Prepares To </F>
Privatize Czech Railways"] 
  [Text] Between 20 and 30 percent of the Czech railway 
system could soon wind up in private hands, according to 
Transportation Minister Jan Strasky. Speaking at a conference 
on the railway system sponsored by the Konrad Adenauer 
Foundation, Strasky noted that three railway lines are already 
slated for sale during the second wave of privatization. 
  "It is not yet clear whether the state will actually sell 
the 
tracks of these or any other lines to those interested, or just 
lease them out," Strasky said, stressing that any new owners 
"would always have to respect the right of the state" to buy the 
line back if the owner should go bankrupt. 
  Josef Bazala, who is in charge of commerce at Czech 
Railways, 
said that about 20 entrepreneurs are interested in operating 
private freight lines. The railway has not begun discussing 
private ownership of passenger lines, as parliament has yet to 
settle some of the legislative issues involved. 
  With 10,000 kilometers (more than 6,000 miles) of track, the 
Czech Republic has one of the densest rail networks in Europe, 
but the infrastructure is largely obsolete. Only 5 percent of 
Czech tracks allow a train speed of more than 120 kilometers (75 
miles) an hour. 
  Partly due to growing problems within the rail network, 
trains are losing business to other forms of transportation. The 
volume of freight carried by railways dropped 11 percent in 
1993. "To make [railways] more efficient, we have to introduce 
competition onto the tracks," said Josef Zatloukal, head of the 
Transport Ministry's policy-making department. 
  Vlastimil Hlidek, who heads the railway department at the 
Transport Ministry, says that the absolute priority for Czech 
Railways in the near future is modernizing the Czech segment of 
the Berlin-Prague-Vienna line. Among possible sources of 
financing for this project are such prestigious institutions as 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the 
European Investment Bank and possibly the World Bank.

<F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Bond Issue Bodes Well for Economy </F>
and Bears Out Government Optimism"] 
  [Text] The city of Prague made $25 million in one hour 
April 14 after Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik floated a huge 
issue of city bonds on the international capital market through 
the Japanese bank Nomura. The positive response to the bond 
issue would seem to bear out last week's announcement by an 
ever-confident Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus that the Czech 
economy is on a steady course to post-transformation stability. 
  International credit rating institutions have been singing 
the same tune for over a year now. Standard and Poor's 
assessment for the second half of 1993 put the Czech Republic on 
the same level as Turkey and Israel, a full three points above 
European Union member Greece. Last year, Moody's awarded the 
Czech Republic a higher credit rating than any other 
post-communist state. 
  And now the results of a poll last week of the 100 foremost 
international banks published by the American finance magazine 
INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR placed the Czech Republic 40th out of 100 
states on the world scale of credit stability. Hungary, which, 
until the split of Czechoslovakia, ranked at the head of the 
post-communist countries, wound up in the 43rd position in the 
magazine's tables. Slovakia came in 59th place. 
  But while the numbers are revealing, they don't quite tell 
all, according to some observers. "There's no real value in 
comparing Eastern European countries' credit ratings," said 
Richard Kriz of the Delegation of German Business in Prague. 
"It's more a matter of an overall regional growth." 
  Most Czech financiers were guardedly optimistic about the 
results of the international poll and of the ratings garnered by 
another magazine, EUROMONEY. The publication also placed the 
Czech Republic in 40th place out of 100, this time relating to 
investment risk. 
  Martin Svehla of the Czech National Bank (CNB) cited 
macroeconomic influences as the main reason for the credit boom. 
Specifically, he mentioned a low but stable exchange rate 
supporting exports, the low rate of inflation and the 
bottoming-out of performance decline. All have made the Czech 
Republic a honey pot for international investors, as have low 
production costs and a skilled work force, he said. 
  Josef Dufil, Client Service Department manager at 
Czechinvest, said the main areas of foreign investment are at 
present car parts manufacturing, light industry, 
electrotechnology and, in particular, mechanical tool 
production. In that field, foreign participation jumped from 4 
percent in 1992 to 10 percent last year. "These areas all take 
precedence over consumer goods production at present," said 
Dufil. 
  The glowing results and even rosier forecasts do not mean 
that all will be easy sailing in the future, warned the CNB's 
Svehla. "I think the hardest times may still be ahead of us," he 
said. This pessimistic view reflects the fact that the Czech 
Republic is in many ways more liberal than the Western European 
economic models it aspires to emulate. As Klaus continues to 
boast about the country's macroeconomic performance, public 
attention is turning to non-economic matters, such as the 
environment and the standard of living. 
  "Mr. Klaus says we must earn environmental improvements," 
said Dufil. "This will be very expensive, and with elections 
approaching there will be increasing pressure on the government 
to do more about it." Svehla agreed that the environment will 
prove a costly thorn in the government's side, especially when 
other key economic factors must inevitably change in the future. 
  "Exchange rates and costs cannot remain as low as they are 
indefinitely, especially as the active role of government is 
being reduced through privatization," he said. 
  The reduction of the government role in industry will take 
longer than the mere completion of the second wave of 
privatization that commenced two weeks ago. "That is only part 
of it," said Svehla. "Once legally privatized, it still takes 
time for large structures to restructure themselves and become 
truly private enterprises. I hope we are powerful enough to cope 
in the future."

  [Text] Budapest, May 13 (MTI) -- "Having the country's 
interests at heart, I sincerely hope those who won a majority at 
the first round of elections have the strength to keep their 
promises and carry out their programme," Prime Minister Peter 
Boross told an election rally in Szombathely (W Hungary) on 
Friday. He said governing had been difficult so far and would 
continue to be so in the future. 
  Boross described the present cabinet as kamikaze, due to the 
lack of adequate means for full accomplishment of its tasks. 
The government is now busy creating conditions for a smooth 
transfer of affairs, he said. 
  Analysing the country's situation, the prime minister cited 
the consolidation of democratic institutions and the basic 
change in property relations as solid reserves for the future. 
  Regarding first-round election results, he said his party, 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], acknowledges the potential 
Free Democrat-Socialist alliance. It is ready to assume the 
role of opposition, but, as he said, the number of seats they 
have in parliament will be of significance. Accordingly, he 
called upon national forces to coordinate their efforts, and 
electors to vote for candidates of the MDF, the Christian 
Democratic People's Party and the Independent Smallholders Party 
in the second round on May 29.

  [Text] Budapest, 15 May (MTI) -- The Independent 
Smallholders' Party (FKGP) has become legitimate in the course 
of the first round of parliamentary elections in Hungary on May 
8. Based on votes cast for the party lists, the FKGP has 
entered parliament, and is preparing for a constructive 
parliamentary opposition role, FKGP Chairman Jozsef Torgyan said 
on Sunday, at an election rally held in Lenti (SW Hungary). 
Torgyan said his party wishes to become the conscience of the 
nation and wishes to call to account the election programmes and 
promises of all political parties in parliament in this spirit. 
  The FKGP chairman said that among their first tasks will be 
to press for putting the economy in order, transforming the bad 
distribution systems and privatization, and preparing for a 
bicameral parliamentary system. Torgyan said the smallholders 
will fight for the enforcement of Hungarian interests in all 
walks of life, particularly in economy, and on an appropriate 
level. 
  As regards the second round of elections on May 29, Torgyan 
was of the opinion that those who cast their votes for the 
Socialists and the free democrats, vote for the strengthening of 
a liberal-communist policy. Those who vote for the smallholders 
support the genuine strength of the right-wing. He added the 
FKGP counts on the votes of the Christian Democrats and "the 
honest members of the Hungarian Democratic Forum".

  [Text] Budapest, 13 May (MTI) -- This was the first time 
in Hungarian history that the country freely voted for the left, 
Lajos Fur, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), 
told a news conference today. In the first round of the 
elections on May 8, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) gained 
a considerable lead, while the MDF finished in third place. In 
Fur's view, the outcome of the first round will cause many 
voters to reconsider their position, or at least revise their 
passions. 
  Fur claims the failure of the MDF and other conservative 
parties was mainly due to objective factors, including 
unfavorable external conditions and the special hardships of 
transition in Hungary, which were exacerbated by the opposition 
and the left-wing press that discredited Hungary. Of course, 
discontent was also generated by the errors of the governing 
coalition, Fur said, adding that the MDF's internal affairs were 
not perfect either. 
  Most people were shocked to learn the outcome of the 
elections. Nor is a triumphant feeling manifest among the 
winners, Fur said. 
  The MDF chairman qualified as unacceptable the statement of 
the left-wing press and some politicians that the failure of the 
MDF and the conservative forces was due to their ivory-tower 
arrogance, aristocratism, and lack of expertise. After the 
second round, the MDF will analyse the causes of the failure, 
Fur said. 
  The MDF chairman announced that the party presidium had 
approved a strategy for the second round, including local deals 
between conservative candidates still in contention. At 
present, 99 MDF candidates are preparing for the second round, 
he said. Fur said voters should be made aware that all votes 
cast for the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats would 
strengthen the left- wing coalition.

  [Text] Budapest, May 13 (MTI) -- Hungary's National Police 
Command (NPC) dismissed as completely groundless the article in 
Friday's issue of the Belgian LE SOIR about a coup being plotted 
for the second round of Hungarian elections. LE SOIR said, 
quoting well-informed sources, that during an attempt to thwart 
the sale of 30kg of false gold, Belgian security forces 
discovered documents allegedly referring to plans of purchasing 
weapons for use in a "coup attempt" at run-off elections on May 
29. 
  The Belgian newspaper has not yet provided concrete details 
or evidence confirming the news. Police will do their utmost to 
prevent the second round of parliamentary elections from being 
disturbed by any unexpected events, the NPC said.

  [Text] Budapest, 14 May (MTI) -- On authorization from the 
Hungarian Government, the Hungarian Embassy in Brussels 
forwarded an official communique to the Belgian news agency 
BELGA on Saturday, in connection with the articles carried in 
the Friday and Saturday issues of the LE SOIR newspaper. 
  The communique states that the primitive allegations made by 
those persons arrested recently by Belgian police in a gold 
selling case form a mix of crude lies and fabrications. The 
Hungarian authorities firmly reject these, as attempts that are 
suited to disrupt the ongoing Hungarian election process, and at 
creating a bad reputation for Hungary. 
  As MTI reported on Friday, Hungary's National Police Command 
(NPC) dismissed the Friday news in the Belgian LE SOIR of a coup 
being plotted for the second round of Hungarian elections as 
totally groundless. LE SOIR said, quoting well-informed 
sources, that during an action to thwart the sale of 30 kg of 
false gold Belgian security forces had found documents allegedly 
referring to plans of purchasing weapons to be used in a "coup 
attempt" at run-off elections on May 29. 
  The Belgian newspaper has not yet provided concrete details 
or evidence confirming the news. Police will do its utmost to 
prevent the second round of parliamentary elections from being 
disturbed by any unexpected events, the NPC said on Friday. 
  According to a Saturday report filed by MTI's Brussels 
correspondent, following the brief report on Friday, LE SOIR 
continued the false gold sale affair, and the alleged related 
weapons purchasing action, in a more detailed article on 
Saturday, but still relying on unofficial sources. Saturday's 
article specially mentioned the alleged Hungarian implications. 
It was in connection with this that the Hungarian Embassy in 
Brussels issued its official denial, based on authorization from 
the Hungarian Government. 
  The article in Saturday's LE SOIR repeats that in the course 
of a search carried out in the home of one of the persons 
concerned in the selling of false gold, police found a telefax 
message about orders for large amounts of ammunition, grenades 
and missles, that bore the name of an American weapons trading 
firm. 
  According to the article, two of the five persons arrested 
in 
the false gold case were Hungarians (a woman and a 50-year-old 
man), however, it is not clear from the article if they are 
Hungarian citizens or of Hungarian origin only. (The Hungarian 
consulate in Belgium does not believe the persons concerned are 
Hungarian citizens, as Belgian authorities have in no way 
contacted the Hungarian foreign representation in the matter by 
Saturday noon, although the arrests were made on Wednesday.) 
  The article attributes a central role to the "Hungarian" 
woman, who heads an export-import office in Munich. The article 
mentions as an example that the Belgian man in whose home the 
fax message was found confessed that this woman was behind the 
order, and that she said she was organizing the transaction on 
behalf of the Hungarian Government. 
  According to LE SOIR, the Belgian man also added that the 
woman held out the prospect that the order would be realized 
after the second round of the Hungarian parliamentary elections 
on May 29. 
  The Belgian security organs and Interpol are carrying out 
coordinated investigations into the affair, writes the Belgian 
newspaper. Similary to Friday's LE SOIR article, the Saturday 
report also lacks any official confirmation or sources.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The visit of the Russian 
prime minister to Budapest at the end of March, and the six 
agreements signed, could promote Hungarian-Russian trade and 
capital transfers already taking place between the two countries. 
  Hungarian exports to Russia were valued at $945 million in 
1993, imports from there $1.7 billion. This was compensated for 
by the delivery of 28 MiG-29 fighter jets, to a value of $713 
million, as the first tranche of Russian, ex-Soviet, state debt 
owed to Hungary. 
  Russia is Hungary's second largest foreign trade partner, 
after Germany, while Hungary is seventh among Russia's partners. 
  In 1991, Russian-Hungarian turnover fell by some 70 percent 
when the trade switched to U.S. dollar accounting. In 1992, 
turnover rose by 17 percent, mainly due to Hungarian grain 
deliveries of 3 million tons. Last year, total turnover was 
valued at $3.35 billion, 6 percent less than in 1992. Hungarian 
imports remained at the same level, but exports to Russia 
declined by 17 percent. 
  In 1993, three-quarters of Hungarian imports were petroleum 
(6 million tons), natural gas (5.3 billion cubic meters), and 
electric energy; 15 percent was other raw materials, 
semi-finished products, and components. The proportion of 
imported consumer goods rose slightly, to 6 percent. 
  The structure of Hungarian exports shows a major change. In 
1992, food accounted for about 50 percent, and the proportion of 
machines and equipment did not even reach 20 percent. Last 
year, the proportion of agricultural and food products declined 
to 30 percent, while that of machinery rose to 30 percent, and 
consumer products stood at around 20 percent. Compared to 1992, 
the Russians purchased 40 percent more machinery, vehicles, and 
medicine. The decline in Hungarian exports in 1993 was wholly 
due to the drop in agricultural exports. 
  Hungary has independent economic agreements with 20 
territories within Russia, also helping trade. In 1994, Hungary 
made such agreements with the Komi and the Udmurt Republics, 
Bashkiria, and the Ivanovo territory. 
  Exports to Russia accounted for 10.6 percent of Hungary's 
total exports in 1993, imports from there for 14.3 percent of 
total imports. The Hungarian Ministry of International Economic 
Relations prepared a development program to promote trade and 
investment with the former Soviet successor states, mainly with 
Russia. The program provided some $1 million to Hungarian 
exporters in 1993. 
  Prime Ministers Peter Boross of Hungary and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin of Russia signed an agreement in Budapest at the 
end of March on avoiding double taxation. The sides are 
negotiating an investment protection agreement. Both aim at 
increasing mutual investment, currently at a low level. At 
present, 1,000 Hungarian firms trade with Russia, where 900 
Hungarian-Russian joint ventures also operate, mainly engaged in 
trade. There are 50 Hungarian-Russian joint ventures in 
Hungary. The products of several major Hungarian joint ventures 
-- Orion telecommunications plant, the Petroleum Equipment 
Factory of Nagykanizsa (southwest Hungary), and the Ikarus Bus 
Factory of Szekesfehervar (west Hungary) -- have Russian buyers. 
  A government agreement of outstanding importance concerned 
the settlement of the remaining, some $900 million worth, of 
debt owed by the former Soviet Union. The agreement on 
repayment designates five areas: military technology, civil 
transport, Hungarian participation in Russian privatization, 
Russian participation in Hungarian privatization, and the 
expansion of tourism links. 
  The Hungarian side would like to participate in Russian 
privatization to a value of at least $200 million. Hungarian 
entrepreneurs would invest in Russian petroleum or natural gas 
firms, or possibly in railway vehicle reconstruction, as a form 
of debt repayment. Talks are in progress on setting up trading 
houses. The Russian side is considering the delivery of iron 
structures for the Budapest World Expo, and participation as 
sub-contractor extending the Budapest underground. In civil 
transport, the Hungarian side would mainly welcome ships, 
machinery and chemical products. 
  The ministers in charge signed cooperation memorandums 
covering telecommunications and post, and a supplementary 
protocol was signed to the 1966 agreement on setting up the Paks 
Nuclear Power Plant in Hungary. The most important parts of the 
latter agreement are that Russia will take back the burnt-out 
fuel rods from the power plant, for which Hungary will pay some 
$40 million, and it will deliver nuclear fuel to the Hungarian 
plant for an additional annual $45 million. 
  The foreign trade ministers signed a protocol on mutual 
deliveries in 1994, which, unlike earlier agreements, no longer 
contains quantitative stipulations, merely recommendations for 
each product group. 
  The Hungarian side wishes to match 1993's trade volume in 
1994, and believes Hungarian exports could go up by 10 percent 
with deliveries of agricultural products, food, medicine, and 
buses.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 15 (CTK) -- "I consider this 
cheek," Milan Ftacnik, deputy chairman of the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL), commented on the advertisement on competition for 
posts published by the HZDS (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) 
in public offices in Friday's edition of the daily PRAVDA. "This 
proves that the HZDS is still striving to become a 
`state-party'," Ftacnik told the Slovak Radio, thus referring to 
the ruling role of the Communists in the previous regime. 
  He said he would not object if the HZDS won the elections 
and 
from the governmental posts organized this sort of competition. 
"But to conduct a competition for the public offices as a party 
has breached the Constitution which stipulates separation of the 
parties from the state. The HZDS has proved that it pushes for 
a party-state in which a party instead of constitutional bodies 
would decide," Ftacnik added, "categorically protesting" against 
making this sort of advertisements. 
  "Those who successfully pass the course for the public 
offices in Slovakia will enter them in October-December 1994," 
the HZDS advertisement promises. The applicants for top 
positions in industry, tertiary sector, state administration, 
foreign service, banking and financial sphere must be Slovak 
nationals under 38, university graduates with organizational 
abilities and mastery of foreign languages. The competition 
will take place on September 9. The parliamentary elections are 
held on September 30-October 1.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 14 (CTK) -- The leadership of the 
Slovak National Party (SNS) decided to recommend to its June 
congress to enter the autumn parliamentary elections 
independently, not in coalition with its current ally, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the SNS Chairman Jan 
Slota announced yesterday. The SNS leadership will recommend to 
the June congress to return to the the original statutes which 
prefer the national to the civic principle, Slota said. The 
April poll showed that the SNS (9 deputies in the 150-member 
Slovak Parliament) is favoured by some four per cent of voters, 
while the HZDS by 32 per cent. 
  The observers have suggested that the decision is connected 
with alleged internal feuds regarding Slota. He enjoys the 
reputation of a radical politician, not acceptable for Meciar's 
HZDS. The press has speculated that the June SNS congress could 
lead to a split into three factions. One could be headed by 
Slota, the second by deputy chairmen of former Meciar's 
government Jan Prokes and Marian Andel, and the third by Juraj 
Molnar who has recently espoused the Pan-Slavic idea of the 
Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky.

  [Text] Bratislava May 16 (CTK) -- Matica Slovenska [Slovak 
Heritage Foundation] considers disturbing the efforts of the 
present government coalition to meet ethnic minority claims and 
adhere to Slovakia's commitments to the Council of Europe (CE) 
by changing the language law and the law on the country's 
administrative and territorial set-up, and adopting a new law on 
registers of births and deaths, Matica representatives declared 
today. Matica Slovenska is a cultural and educational 
organisation founded in 1863. 
  Matica's secretary, Stanislav Bajanik, said that mainly the 
government bill to provide for bilingual names of almost 600 
towns in Slovakia's regions with mixed population, which is soon 
to be presented to parliament, "threatens state sovereignty and 
recalls the Horthyan occupation" (Hungary, ruled by regent 
Miklos Horthy, occupied a considerable part of Slovakia's 
south-eastern territory in winter 1938-39). 
  Bajanik said he insisted on minority claims to be solved 
only 
after the autumn elections, otherwise they could be subject to 
pre-election machinations. According to Bajanik, the names of 
the almost one-fifth of Slovak towns to have multilingual names 
should be decided in a referendum. 
  Matica is resolutely opposed to the re-naming of the towns 
carrying the names of significant figures of Slovak history and 
culture. "Nor does it want that originally Slovak towns and 
villages, which were Magyarised over the past century, bear 
Hungarian names," he stressed. 
  Matica urges parliament to adopt a law which would enable 
the 
minorities to use only the towns' Slovak names transcribed into 
their mother tongue, and only in the communities where 
non-Slovak population form a simple majority. Matica also 
demands that all official documents be consistently written in 
Slovak, which is the "state language". 
  The Slovak Government has already approved amendments to 
relevant laws providing for bilingual names of towns and 
villages in the regions where the ethnic minority forms more 
than one-fifth of the population, in line with minority claims 
and Slovakia's commitments to the CE. The government has also 
approved the bill enabling ethnic minority members to use 
Christian names and surnames in their original form, and the 
free of charge official change of these names from their Slovak 
version. 
  The two legislative changes, now to be discussed by 
parliament, rank among Slovakia's most important commitments to 
the CE undertaken before the country was admitted to the Council 
last June. Their fulfillment is to be evaluated by the CE 
Secretariat in Warsaw on May 17.

<F P=106> [Article by Kevin Drew: "Slovakia Pushes Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--Slovak leaders are stepping up their 
economic reform program, pledging to put 100 billion Sk ($3.3 
billion) worth of companies on the market when the second wave 
of privatization is launched in September. Around 300 
companies, representing 33 percent of all state-owned property, 
are slated to go on the auction block this fall. In comparison, 
only 3 percent privatized between June 1992, when Vladimir 
Meciar was elected prime minister, and last month, when 
parliament forced him out of office. 
  The drive towards privatization, timed to hit on the eve of 
the national elections scheduled for Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, is 
being urged along by government officials and economists who 
want to reinstill in the international community the confidence 
that Slovakia is committed to reform. "The aim is to push 
privatization so far that no future government could reverse it, 
not even Meciar," said one Western advisor who wished to remain 
anonymous. 
  Inheritors of the poorer half of the former Czechoslovak 
nation, Slovak leaders have managed to make some progress 
towards a market economy. The private sector now accounts for 
nearly 40 percent of economic activity and government debt is 
low compared to many other post-communist countries. 
  "It's not that Slovakia has backpedaled or done poorly," 
said 
Andreas Georgiou, resident representative of the International 
Monetary Fund. "Slovakia hasn't progressed as rapidly as it 
could have, but it has progressed." 
  Between 1989 and 1992, 30 percent of the Slovak economy was 
privatized. But soon after Meciar was elected prime minister in 
June 1992, the Slovak government announced it was slowing the 
pace of privatization, arguing that rapid reforms could backfire 
by creating skyrocketing inflation, unemployment and public 
discontent. 
  A number of the privatization projects carried out under 
Meciar's government have since been attacked as illegal. Early 
this month, for instance, the parliamentary committee for 
privatization found that 13 projects approved by the Meciar 
administration in February violated the government's own 
privatization rules by giving advantages to a select group of 
buyers. 
  The former government approved the direct sale of state 
companies to pre-selected buyers, even though the buyers of some 
firms such as Tesla Stropkov, Skloobal Nemsova, ZOS Vrutkz and 
ZOS Trnava could not demonstrate that they had enough financial 
resources to develop the companies. 
  The slowdown in privatization never achieved its goals, 
however. Under Meciar, unemployment and inflation shot up 
because the government never implemented a clear reform path. 
Budget deficits began to mount. 
  Unemployment in Slovakia now stands at 15 percent, compared 
to 3 percent in the Czech Republic; inflation is 15 percent, 
compared to the annualized Czech rate of 10 percent; and the 
average monthly income is $160, compared to over $200 in the 
Czech Republic. 
  The slowdown of privatization also sent warning signals to 
international investors initially eager to capitalize on 
Slovakia's well-trained and cheap labor poor. By mid-1992, only 
122 Slovak companies had U.S. investment, totaling just $20 
million. 
  "Investors don't like uncertainty," said Douglas Swaim, 
senior investment officer of the Slovak-American Enterprise 
Fund. "From the inside, we're convinced that Slovakia will 
stabilize. But from the outside, you have to wonder." 
  In the six months left before the fall elections, the new 
government hopes to assuage such fears. "We must finish our 
attempts at macroeconomic stability as well as microeconomic 
stability," Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus told reporters 
recently. 
  Government leaders intend to reduce this year's projected 
budget deficit from 23 billion Sk to 6 billion Sk, lower 
inflation to 13 percent and keep unemployment under 17 percent. 
Courting foreign aid and smoothing trade relations with the 
Czech Republic are also priorities. 
  "To some degree, Slovakia is a diamond in the rough," said 
Swaim. "If the country can get its act together with 
privatization and articulating a clear economic policy, it will 
have no trouble attracting investors."

  [Text] Trencianske Teplice, West Slovakia, May 13 (CTK) -- 
Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner and his Czech 
counterpart Jan Ruml today agreed on a common Czech-Slovak 
border administration, the conclusions of the joint border 
commission, and on the delimitation of personal files of former 
StB (secret police) members. 
  Ruml told journalists after the meeting that the two 
countries' governments would confirm the conclusions of the 
border commission which agreed on an exchange of the villages of 
U Sabotu and Sidonie and on the compensation for territorial 
losses due to the regulation of the course of the Morava River. 
The controversial Czech cottage owners' colony of Kasarna will 
be discussed by the Czech and Slovak premiers, Vaclav Klaus and 
Jozef Moravcik. Ruml praised Slovakia's willingness to speed up 
customs clearance at road and railway border crossings. 
  Pittner informed his colleague of the Slovak cabinet's 
intention to "gradually introduce a standard regime on the 
common border." Both ministers also agreed on the joint use of 
the personal files of former StB members until their 
transportation to Slovakia. 
  After the meeting with Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml, his 
Slovak counterpart Ladislav Pittner told journalists that as of 
May 18 measures aimed at speeding up customs clearance would be 
introduced at one road border crossing, and gradually they would 
be used at all road and railway checkpoints on the common 
Czech-Slovak border. 
  Pittner said that the introduction of a standard regime on 
the common border would not concern the two countries' citizens. 
"In this way the protection of both states against immigrants 
from third countries will be guaranteed," he said, and added 
that Slovakia decided to take this step after it found out that 
the signing of a Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement was in 
sight. 
  "Slovakia is also interested in the guarding of the open 
countryside border, but our financial means are limited," 
Pittner said. He said he agreed with Ruml that the Czech 
Ministries of the Interior and Defense would help Slovakia in 
the search for people who were forcibly taken by the former 
Soviet secret police KGB to the Soviet Union after the Second 
World War.

  [Text] Bratislava May 16 (CTK) -- "The fact itself that I 
am an acquaintance of Zhirinovskiy does not mean that I am his 
follower. I disagree with many of his views," Jozef Lauko told 
CTK today. Lauko, an entrepreneur who, along with Ladislav 
Mojzis, the owner of West-Club restaurant in Bratislava, invited 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia (LDPR) for a private visit to Slovakia. [sentence as 
received] Zhirinovskiy, accompanied by six aides, is to arrive 
in Slovakia on Saturday, May 21. 
  "I favour him because of his effort to return respect and 
authority to the Russian nation and all Slavs," Lauko said of 
Zhirinovskiy. He said he "invited Zhirinovskiy to Slovakia 
merely as a private person", and assured that "no Slovak 
political party stands behind" his invitation. He added he had 
known Zhirinovskiy for more than 15 years. The Russian 
politician wanted to visit Slovakia mainly to have a rest, he 
added. Lauko himself is not a member of any political party. 
  "After all, I do not expect any Slovak politician to afford 
meeting him now, before elections," Lauko said. The elections 
in Slovakia are slated for September 30 and October 1. However, 
Lauko pointed to the importance of the opportunity of meeting a 
man, who he claimed would most probably be the next Russian 
president. 
  Lauko said that the West perceived the idea of pan-Slavic 
mutuality, promoted by Zhirinovskiy, as an element dangerous to 
its (Western) interests. The West has beat the economic bloc in 
the economic sphere, but now it has come to an understanding 
that it has caused great problems to itself at the same time, 
Lauko said. 
  "I am convinced that the time is not far away when the West 
will start to raise political and administrative obstacles so 
that visits by Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians and Belarussians... be 
reduced to the least possible frequency and number," Lauko 
stated. 
  "What is the difference between our suffering under the yoke 
of the West and of Russia?" Lauko reacted to the question 
whether the idea of "pan-Slavism" would not lead to Central and 
Eastern Europe's return under the Russian yoke. He said 
Slovakia was now in a worse economic situation than when it was 
a part of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and 
the Warsaw Pact within the Czechoslovak Federation. However, 
Slovakia remains dependent on Russian energy sources, he stated. 
  "Zhirinovskiy won the Russian elections because he gave hope 
to his nation," Lauko said, adding that Zhirinovskiy had built 
his electoral victory on the inability of his political rivals.

  [Text] Bratislava May 16 (CTK) -- The Slovak Police do not 
prepare "any extra measures" in connection with the envisaged 
visit by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDPR), to Slovakia, Slovak Interior Minister 
Ladislav Pittner told CTK today. Zhirinovskiy is to arrive for 
a private visit to Bratislava on May 21, at the invitation of 
Ladislav Mojzis, the owner of West-Club restaurant in 
Bratislava, and Jozef Lauko, who attended the LDPR April 
congress as an honorary guest. 
  Any Russian citizen can arrive in Slovakia when invited, as 
Slovakia has visa-free relations with Russia, Pittner said. 
"The situation would be different if the visitor did not keep 
to Slovak laws," Pittner said, adding that in this case police 
would act according to the law.

  [Text] Tirana, May 14 (ATA) -- The president of the 
Republic of Kosova, Ibrahim Rugova, considered as very dangerous 
the warning made by the Serbian authorities for banning the 
Democratic League [LDK], the main Albanian party in Kosova. 
Speaking at a press conference in Prishtina, President Rugova 
said yesterday that "this is a tendency for disintegration of 
the political life in Kosova and if the Democratic League will 
be banned, this act would have been one of the grave provocation 
to the Albanian population in Kosova. Mr. Rugova said also that 
"it will not be a good step nor for the Serbian regime nor for 
the Serbians. 
  President Rugova pointed out that the Democratic League of 
Kosova is the biggest party of Albanians in Kosova and it has 
been registered since 1990 in the former Yugoslav Federation in 
which Kosova was a constitutive unit. 
  President Rugova spoke also of the Serbian military 
exercises 
in Kosova in which the Serbian defence minister, Bulatovic, 
participated. Mr. Rugova considered the exercises as "a grave 
signal at this moment."

  [Text] By a decree of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, Deputy 
Defense Minister Grigor Khandzhiev has been relieved of his 
post. The date of his release is 20 May 1994. 
  The dismissal is on the basis of Article 328-A, which states 
that the labor contract of a person who has a responsible post 
can be discontinued when this is in the best operational 
interest. This was reported by reporter Khristo Khristov, who 
will try to learn more details about this rather surprising 
dismissal of the deputy defense minister.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Varshava Maksimova on the general </F>
strike declared by the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions 
in Bulgaria on 18 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] According to information supplied by the 
National Strike Committee of the KNSB [Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria], over 130,000 people took 
part in the first day of the general strike; they included 
workers from the health care, educational, transportation, 
trade, and light industry sectors, as well as state employees. 
  As of today a further 24 enterprises throughout the country 
began indefinite all-out strike actions. Doctors in hospitals 
in Sliven, Berkovitsa, Ardino, Ivaylovgrad, and the Higher 
Medical Institute in Sofia suspended medical examinations for 
one hour. In Plovdiv the city transportation workers stopped 
work from 0600 to 0900, while public transportation services 
were suspended for one hour in Gabrovo, Dobrich, and Razlog. In 
Svishtov the dockers blocked the river port for one hour. 
  According to information from the strike committee, the 
strike attracted the heaviest mass support in 11 towns 
nationwide, including Turgovishte, Kazanluk, Razlog, Sandanski, 
and Blagoevgrad. Marches and rallies were held in a number of 
towns, while in Sofia workers from the Kremikovtsi Metallurgical 
Plant and the engineering plants in Sopot protested in front of 
the Council of Ministers building and the National Assembly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F>
by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: 
"Our Kamikaze Government"] 
  [Text] [LIDOVE NOVINY] Mr. Minister, how do you explain 
the fact that the voters dumped you after four years? 
  [Jeszenszky] We made a mistake in communication; we did not 
manage to put across our successes. Some people have claimed 
that, during the past month, we have been conducting a clumsy 
propaganda campaign of success. However, we were merely 
informing the people of what we have achieved. For instance, 
many people got back their property, something they did not even 
dream of in 1990. 
  Moreover, a campaign was waged in our country for four years 
claiming that we were not succeeding. It was also claimed often 
that we have no experts. At the same time, no Hungarian 
Government has ever had so many educated people, people with 
academic titles. It was thought that the previous communist 
government had the experts and that these people would be 
necessary. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Did you not lose because you behaved in too 
authoritarian a manner, because you, for instance, discharged 
hundreds of journalists critical of the government from public 
radio and television? 
  [Jeszenszky] In no way; these journalists were not 
discharged by the government or the Hungarian Democratic Forum. 
The government cannot interfere in these media. Many people, 
especially Hungarians living abroad, are not satisfied with 
television and radio. They complain that these media only 
present our country in a bad light. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your opinion of the victorious 
Socialists? Is it possible to talk about the return of the old 
communist structures or is there a young, liberally endowed left 
wing at the head of this party as there is in Poland? 
  [Jeszenszky] There are about 20 more of these Hungarian 
Socialists than Polish socialists and, according to some 
observers, they are in an even worse situation than in 1990. 
That is, they have no Pozsgay or Nemeth. However, I am keeping 
my fingers crossed for them and hope that they come up to 
scratch and keep their promises. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Why did people vote for them? 
  [Jeszenszky] This was a typical protest vote against the 
government; the people did not want us to carry on. They 
succumbed to illusions. Hungarian communism was, during its 
last 10 years, more moderate than in your country. Gas and 
bread were cheaper then than they are today and people believe 
that they will again become less expensive. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What will you do after the elections? Will 
you return to history, to your original field? 
  [Jeszenszky] I would like to. I have given a lecture once a 
week for four whole years. However, I will probably have to 
remain in parliament and supervise government policy. Former 
Prime Minister Antall was my history teacher, I had known him 
since I was 15, and I feel obliged to carry on his ideas.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Democratic Forum Spokesman Karply </F>
Herenyi by Janos Papp; place and date not given: "The MDF's 
Hopes Are Justified -- One Has To Be Able To Step Down"] 
  [Text] It is very quiet right now between the two rounds 
of elections; reports are only coming in from the two 
prospectively victorious parties. Our correspondent interviewed 
Karoly Herenyi, spokesman for the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF]. 
  [Papp] The MDF has become quiet in the current period of the 
election campaign. Why? 
  [Herenyi] I do not think or claim that the MDF has been 
pushed into the background; the focus of the election campaign 
has simply been moved somewhere else. Up until now, the MDF has 
been thinking in national terms, while we are now concentrating 
on local campaign tasks. 
  [Papp] Does the performance of the 99 MDF candidates who are 
still in the contest have any import? 
  [Herenyi] Naturally, very much is at stake in the second 
round. It will be decided here whether the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will 
form a coalition and whether the two parties will acquire 
two-thirds of the mandates. If the electors decide that the 
Socialists alone are to govern the country, then the specter of 
one-party governing will again emerge. On this basis, I can 
also say that if the MSZP and the SZDSZ together manage to form 
a two-thirds majority coalition, then the same tendencies may 
prevail that I have already mentioned. In my view, the best 
solution would be if the MSZP was not able to form a government 
on its own, and, even with the SZDSZ, its only possible 
coalition partner, they were not able to reach a two-thirds 
majority of mandates in parliament. 
  [Papp] A deputy of the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] announced that he would not adhere to the agreement 
signed by [MDF Chairman] Lajos Fur and [KDNP Chairman] Laszlo 
Surjan [on withdrawing some candidates in favor of the other in 
the second round]. Will the MDF continue to observe the 
agreement? 
  [Herenyi] The MDF is naturally adhering to the former 
decisions. It has to be known that the MDF has more faith in 
the electors' wisdom than in ill-considered statements of 
certain politicians. People who place individual interests 
above all else do not meet the approval of the large masses of 
society. It is a fact that the individual view of one person 
cannot influence or change an agreement that was made between 
gentlemen. 
  [Papp] Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP], has distanced himself from the MDF 
several times recently. What are your views on relations 
between the two parties? 
  [Herenyi] In spite of Torgyan's various statements, we ask 
the voters who have national sentiments to strengthen the FKGP 
candidates' access to parliament in places where they are still 
in the contest in the second round of the election struggle.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas by </F>
Aniko Kobli; place and date not given: "One Should Not React to 
Stupidity by Hitting"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kobli] Regardless of 
society's judgment, do you think it was a mistake to only make 
use of your popularity in the campaign? Although this did not 
make the Republic Party look like a one-man party, it 
nevertheless was based on your person. 
  [Palotas] We probably need more time to analyze the campaign 
strategies, but I do not think this played a role in the 
election results. The citizens did not want to choose between 
people. No one was interested in what the programs of various 
political parties contained. 
  [Kobli] But one could not know in advance that this would be 
the case. 
  [Palotas] In that case, one cannot know for sure that the 
strategy would have failed either. The Republic Party 
deliberately placed the responsibility on one person, while it 
presented its professional programs with the help of its 
experts. I do not want to argue, but the Republic Party 
presented the largest number of experts to the public. It is 
impossible to tell whether this was a good campaign or a bad one 
according to the election results. Therefore, the concept did 
not fail; it is another matter whether our campaign could have 
focused on other things. It is possible that a simplified 
program would have received greater attention. This is where I 
see possibilities for analysis. [passage omitted] 
  [Kobli] Irrespective of the fact that your party has not 
made it into parliament, in your view is there any justification 
for a nonideological party in Hungary? 
  [Palotas] The present situation shows that there is no 
justification for such a party. We created a political 
formation that will be characteristic in Western Europe only in 
five or 10 years. I wanted not only to catch up with the 
Western processes but also to precede them. However, the 
present elections in Hungary were like the ones in the developed 
democracies 20 years ago. I do not want to lose my optimism, 
and I hope I will not have to come to the conclusion that there 
are no chances for such a political formation in Hungary. 
  [Kobli] According to some views, the small parties should be 
gathered together. 
  [Palotas] It was said at our National Committee meeting that 
the appearance of the Entrepreneurs' Party, the Agrarian 
Alliance, and the Republic Party as some kind of a common force 
would increase the voters' confidence in us. One should not be 
hasty, but perhaps we can talk about this after the elections. 
However, this requires the will of all the aforementioned 
parties, and we should also know better what we want. 
Therefore, although I do not want to make a positive result out 
of a negative election result, I must nevertheless say that 
several quite well-known political parties that have been 
present on the Hungarian political arena for four or five years 
fared considerably worse than the Republic Party. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Anca Lazarescu: "What Is the Special </F>
Telecommunications Service, What Does It Aim To Do, and To Whom 
Is It Subordinated?"; all figures as published] 
  [Text] On 7 June 1993 MONITORUL OFICIAL published 
Government Decision No. 229 of 27 May 1993 "on certain measures 
related to the organization and functioning of the Special 
Telecommunications Service" [Serviciul de Telecomunicatii 
Speciale -- STS]. Assuming the very likely hypothesis that our 
readers have never heard of that so-called "special" service 
before, we have to reassure them that there is no reason for 
them to be excessively worried or surprised, because it had 
already functioned before the aforementioned government decision 
was published -- originally within the DIE [Department for 
Foreign Intelligence] and, after the revolution, within the 
Ministry of National Defense. Aside from this, our readers can 
be "relaxed" also considering that our parliamentary 
representatives know exactly as little about STS as they do. 
Or, at least, that is what some of them claim. Being aware or 
not of what the STS actually is, quite soon our representatives 
will have to take a vote on the budget of that institution. In 
the draft law on the state budget, the government earmarked 21 
billion lei for the STS. Is that a lot or is it little? It 
depends on the angle from which one looks at it. Making a 
simple comparison, let us merely remark that for the Ministry of 
Telecommunications the 1994 state budget allots 8.4 billion lei. 
I let you reach your own conclusions. 
  Article 1 of the government decision signed by Prime 
Minister 
Nicolae Vacaroiu, Finance Minister Florin Georgescu, [former] 
Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu, and Telecommunications 
Minister Andrei Chirica stipulates: "The STS is a special 
central body in the domain of special telecommunications." 
  Thus, as a "central body," the STS is actually a kind of a 
governmental structure. As a matter of fact, Article 4 
stipulates: "The STS is led by a director, the office of whom is 
equivalent to those of secretaries of state, while the office of 
his deputies to those of undersecretaries of state." 
  Basically, "the organization, the functioning, and the 
principal attributions of the STS are established by the Supreme 
Defense Council of the country." (Article 2) 
  The STS cooperates with the institutions belonging to the 
national defense system, but also with the Ministry of 
Telecommunications, in accordance with Article 3, carrying out 
the following activities: 
  a) Administers, develops, and exploits special telephone 
communication networks and data transmission networks; 
  b) Administers, develops, and exploits the TO 
[Telecomunicatii Operative] interurban teleconference network; 
  c) Administers, develops, and exploits the special 
radio-communications network, which consists of stationary and 
mobile radio-communication networks and radio relays; 
  d) Manages the radio-electric frequency spectrum used by the 
government; 
  e) Ensures the protection of the telecommunication networks 
being responsible for the carrying out of the activities of 
radio-electronic surveillance, special technical checking 
measures, and the introduction of appropriate codifying 
[aparatura secretizata] equipment; 
  f) Carries out or approves all investments and equipping 
works in the domain of special telecommunications listed in the 
appendix of the present decision; 
  g) Carries out collateral activities needed for the 
achievement of the goals of its activity: Ensures its own 
technical-material supplies, including importations in 
concordance with the current legislation, engages in technical 
and informational research and design, and ensures training, 
medical assistance, and social-cultural activity for its 
personnel; 
  h) Ensures liaison with international bodies in that branch. 
  To this lengthy list of clouded and uncontrollable 
activities 
(the National Defense Council can supplement them by assigning 
it further tasks!) the STS is to carry out, let us add the 
explanations given by Tatiana Francu, the head of the STS 
Department for Relations with the Public, explanations that were 
published in the review EXPRES in virtue of the right to reply: 
"The STS is a special military body in the domain of 
telecommunications, working for the public authority and the 
central and territorial bodies of the state administration, and 
which ensures the cooperation link among the institutions 
belonging to the national defense system."

<H5>  Will the STS Take Over One Part of the "Tasks" of the </H5>
Romanian Intelligence Service? 
  Everything would be all right, as it is normal that such a 
service should exist, if there were no doubts in connection with 
the way in which the STS was founded and the goals it actually 
pursues. The mystery surrounding it and the lack of any 
democratic control over its activity obviously generate 
suspicion. 
  According to the report elaborated by the APADOR [expansion 
unknown] Association--Helsinki Committee, Government Decision 
No. 229 of 1993 is unconstitutional, because according to 
Article 107 of the Constitution, "government decisions are 
issued to organize the carrying out of laws." However, in this 
case there is no law the implementation of which would make 
necessary the setting up of the aforementioned service. What is 
even more, Article 1 of the government decision does not even 
mention the setting up of the service, but rather resumes purely 
and simply to define it. 
  On the other hand, if this service is really a military body 
working for the institutions of the national defense system, in 
that case, according to Article 117 of the constitution, the STS 
could not possibly have been set up without Parliament's passing 
an organic law on its establishment. However, if the STS does 
not have a military nature, then why does the government 
decision fail to define what "special telecommunications" are 
and why is it that "the special telecommunication networks 
detailed in the appendix to the present decision are sent to the 
interested persons, only"? Regardless of how one looks at it, 
Government Decision No. 229 contradicts the Constitution. 
  Unfortunately, Parliament can in no way exert control over 
this service. According to the Law on National Security, the 
number of intelligence services is limited to six. The STS is 
not mentioned among them. Until now Parliament has been 
exerting control solely over one of them, namely the SRI 
[Romanian Intelligence Service]. 
  Could it be that the STS was founded especially to take over 
one part of the SRI's activity (such as the wiretapping of 
telephone conversations) and thus bypass any control? Under the 
circumstances of the total lack of openness and the numerous 
ambiguities they make use of, everything is possible.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and his entourage 
returned from a two-day official visit to France late last 
night. The talks demonstrated that the French partners have been 
very well informed about the political situation in Slovakia. 
They have expressed sincere interest in cooperating with us in 
numerous spheres. Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik granted 
an interview to our editor Magda Pospisilova last night, after 
his arrival by air from Paris. 
  [Begin recording] [Pospisilova] When you were received by 
French President Francois Mitterrand, it took almost an hour 
instead of the planned 35 minutes. This attests to the success 
of your trip. Can you tell us something specific? 
  [Moravcik] I was very pleased by the president's interest in 
the events in Slovakia and our foreign policy, especially 
Slovakia's endeavors to integrate with the European Union. I 
had enough time to explain our policies to the president. I 
stressed that the presence of France in the center of Europe, 
and Slovakia as well, was very important from the point of view 
of stability in Central Europe and that of the stability of all 
Europe. 
  The president was also intensely interested in our relations 
with our neighbors--he was, above all, interested in relations 
with Hungary. I explained our policy aims in this sphere in 
great detail, and I can say that my explanation met with great 
understanding on the part of the president. 
  [Pospisilova] The result of all this is also the fact that 
Mr. Mitterrand accepted an invitation to visit Slovakia. 
  [Moravcik] Yes, I conveyed an invitation from our president, 
and I can say that the president accepted this invitation with 
genuine and real interest. 
  [Pospisilova] When will this official visit take place? 
  [Moravcik] We assume that it will take place in September. 
It is now a technical question--we must agree on a suitable 
date for both sides. 
  [Pospisilova] You said during all of your meetings in Paris 
that we ourselves were capable of agreeing about bilateral 
questions with Hungary and that we did not need the mediating 
role of the European Union. How did the French side accept your 
words? 
  [Moravcik] With great respect, above all, when we explained 
our approach toward the solution of the open questions that 
remain between the two countries. There are no problems in this 
respect. 
  [Pospisilova] You had talks with former French President 
Giscard d'Estaing about the significance of political parties in 
creating stability in Central Europe. What should our political 
entities do for this? 
  [Moravcik] The basic idea is very simple. I think it is 
being implemented in practice in our political life. A 
political party structure similar to that in Western Europe 
should be created. It is very important because the 
significance of direct cooperation between the political parties 
is growing. 
  [Pospisilova] How many of the big economic projects that you 
discussed in Paris will be started by the end of September--that 
is, by the beginning of the elections? 
  [Moravcik] It would be good if there were as many as 
possible. 
  [Pospisilova] Which ones specifically? 
  [Moravcik] We would be very glad if we could make progress 
in 
completing the building of Mochovce [nuclear power station]; 
there is also a chance that cooperation in the sphere of the gas 
industry will become more dynamic. We are interested also in 
cooperation in the automobile industry and in the participation 
of French firms. 
  [Pospisilova] So far, you have talked only about what you 
agreed with the French representatives. What are the open 
questions? 
  [Moravcik] [passage omitted] As for the Bratislava metro, I 
expressed our view--that we considered this project very 
interesting because it was of a high technical standard, but, in 
view of our current economic situation, we had to consider in 
greater detail whether the economic possibilies existed for it. 
  [Pospisilova] You also had talks with Minister of Defense 
Leotard. Did you discuss possible cooperation in the arms 
industry? 
  [Moravcik] Such cooperation is being considered. I think it 
would be for the benefit of our industry. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by Martin Krno; place and date not given: 
"Hatred Is a Poor Counselor"] 
  [Text] I suppose it would not be far from the truth if we 
were to state that the most bitter exchange to date between 
representatives of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] and 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] took place during 
the most recent "Kroky" television program. Their mutual 
relations seemed different two years ago. Why have they 
worsened considerably? We turned to SDL Chairman Peter Weiss and 
asked him this question. 
  [Weiss] Our relations were never ideal. 
  [Krno] Now you can say it openly: Did the prime minister 
really rip your jacket at the U.S. Consulate in the summer of 
1992? 
  [Weiss] No. It was merely a verbal tussle. We respected 
the results of the elections, but we always tried to formulate 
an independent policy. We rejected the "Join us!" philosophy 
and all of the sermonizing aimed at us. We have our own 
objectives. We did not cause the domestic political crisis; it 
was caused by the gradual differentiation in the Slovak National 
Party and the HZDS. This movement has still not adopted a 
profile. It does not belong to any European political family, 
it has no allies abroad, it does not know exactly what it wants, 
and it is inscrutable. Therefore, again and again it inclines 
toward social and national demagoguery. The reasons for the 
crisis can also be seen in the way the HZDS leadership treated 
its own deputies. One-quarter of them refused to subject their 
honor to any more humiliation and left. We proposed early 
elections in April 1993. The HZDS rejected this proposal, 
although, given the ratio of forces in the National Council at 
that time, we could have put the early elections far behind us. 
The crisis culminated in the intensifying conflict between the 
prime minister and the president, a conflict that began to 
threaten our constitutional system. 
  [Krno] Parliament adopted its well-known decision on 11 
March. Some people have called it a parliamentary putsch... 
  [Weiss] The idea is being foisted on our citizens that, in 
the last elections, they did not elect 150 deputies but one man 
who was given carte blanche to govern for four years and that 
parliament did not have the right to recall him. The art of 
politics is not only to win the elections, but also to maintain 
a majority in the parliament. I see no political, policy, or 
moral reason that the SDL deputies should be obliged, by means 
of their votes, to patch up the hole the HZDS chairman created 
by not being able to keep his parliamentary club together. 
  [Krno] The SDL had already had particular experience with 
the former prime minister. Why were you considering, until the 
last moment, whether or not to enter into a coalition with the 
HZDS? 
  [Weiss] I personally was not in favor of this, but ways were 
being sought of bridging the period until the early elections. 
However, it was impossible to reach a compromise with the HZDS 
on a date for the elections. Following Michal Kovac's speech in 
parliament, it was essential to consider whether we would take 
the side of those who, on Zupne Square, were chanting the slogan 
"Rather a civil war than the president!" or of those who wanted 
to resolve the crisis by democratic means. Not only our grave 
reservations about the government's inept policy but also its 
very bad image abroad played a role in our decisionmaking. 
Support for the former prime minister would have complicated 
our position abroad and our chances of being accepted into the 
Socialist International. Despite this, I said in the National 
Council on 11 March that we were willing to enter into an open 
coalition with the HZDS for the transitional period, but on the 
condition that there would be no political elite in the Cabinet. 
The prime minister, however, placed his personal interests 
above the HZDS remaining in power. 
  [Krno] Information was made available at an HZDS meeting in 
Bratislava last week about the visit made to Washington last 
year by Jan Carnogursky. Apparently, he reached an agreement 
there with President Clinton that, along with you and Milan 
Knazko, he would tear down Meciar's government. Are we to 
understand your coming visit to the United States as the 
culmination of this agreement? 
  [Weiss] I would view this as a political joke, with the 
addendum that the U.S. Democratic Party has swollen the ranks of 
HZDS traitors.... But, seriously, I am going to the United 
States with Milan Ftacnik to hold talks on the opportunities for 
economic cooperation and the development of political relations. 
We will meet with representatives from Congress, the Department 
of State, the National Security Council, and business circles. 
  [Krno] Will you ask them what is happening with regard to 
the flow of money to Slovakia? When the prime minister returned 
from New York last year, he claimed that he had been told there 
that, if the SDL enters the government, we can wave good-bye to 
U.S. capital. 
  [Weiss] The SDL is now a governing party, and the atmosphere 
of the talks with the IMF and the World Bank being conducted on 
behalf of the Slovak Republic by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita 
Schmognerova, who was nominated by our party, is favorable. I 
recently toured the most crisis-hit regions, Gemer and Spis, and 
I am preparing to visit others. 
  It is depressing for a left-wing politician to look into 
the eyes of unemployed workers and high school and university 
graduates and, at the same time, feel that they want to hear 
from you something that would give them immediate hope. 
However, I will not promise them the earth, as the former prime 
minister did last year at a meeting in Spisska Nova Ves. Not 
one heller of the 250 million korunas promised to revitalize the 
district has materialized. It is necessary to place the economy 
as a whole on its feet, but, at the same time, it is essential 
to draw up special programs for the most threatened regions. 
Some activities can be financed from foreign aid. Therefore, 
in the United States, we will also discuss guaranteeing the 
political conditions for expanding investments in Slovakia. 
  [Krno] What is the situation regarding the accusations from 
Pavol Hagyari and, most recently, Vladimir Meciar that you are 
not a left-wing party? 
  [Weiss] The first does not know how to win support for his 
own right-wing party, so he is at least dreaming that the SDL 
has deviated to the right. The shadow prime minister is not a 
political scientist; he contradicts himself very often. There 
are also other statements made by him--for example, that the 
HZDS forms the pragmatic center between the SDL and the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The truth, however, is 
that HZDS deputies have on many occasions voted in the 
parliament along with the Christian democrats. For example, on 
agricultural policy, on the restitution of church property, and 
on the law on national holidays. At that time, our 
left-wingedness presented a major obstacle to the HZDS. Meciar's 
movement pursued, especially as far as satisfying the interests 
of its functionaries' aktiv was concerned, a vulgarly 
egotistical, elitist right-wing policy based on controlling the 
state apparatus by the system of "winner takes all." The 
reproaches aimed at us, that we do not pursue a left-wing 
policy, are part of the normal preelection propaganda, and are 
an element of the scenario to destroy the SDL. The HZDS 
chairman is peeved that only our party has resisted his ability 
to break up political entities. 
  [Krno] Divide et impera, maintained the ancient Romans.... 
It was interesting to observe on the aforementioned program how 
Kroky tried to bring you into conflict one after the other with 
Roman Kovac, the KDH, the SDL membership base, and even your own 
ministers. Is there really such cantankerousness between you 
and your coalition partners in the government? 
  [Weiss] The wish is father to the thought. I know that we 
are troublesome because, in an election coalition with the 
Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, the Green Party in 
Slovakia, and the Farmers' Movement, we will be the most serious 
opponent of the HZDS in the elections. Naturally, it is not 
easy to work in the current coalition government. However, we 
have agreed on a government program that also proceeds from the 
SDL's fundamental policy aims. Many supporters of the left wing 
are not reproaching our deputies so much for expressing no 
confidence in the former prime minister as for entering into a 
coalition with the KDH. This coalition, born of reason and 
aimed at getting Slovakia out of its plight, has an important 
aspect: All of us participating in it have stopped looking back 
at the past and have begun to emphasize the future. Slovakia is 
marked by feelings of hatred among those who, from 1945 to the 
present, have experienced major political defeats. Now it must 
decide whether to challenge the intensity of intractable hatred, 
the setting of people against each other, and the concoction of 
enemies. Left-wing policy can also be formulated in a coalition 
government. If this were impossible, the Austrian Social 
Democratic Party, which is already serving a second term in a 
government with Christian democrats, would not have the right to 
call itself left-wing. We will go into the elections on the 
basis of an agreement among the left-wing forces. We also want 
to achieve the results that would enable us to continue all the 
positive things our ministers have begun in the current 
government. 
  [Krno] Reports have been leaked to the public that disputes 
have erupted among your ministers. Were there threats of 
resignation in the air? 
  [Weiss] There is a need for a consistent dialogue in every 
government. We have had some lively discussions in the SDL 
ministerial club. They concerned, in particular, the 
negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank, the measures for 
stabilizing the state budget and creating the financial 
resources for education, health care, and the judiciary. It is 
quite natural that, during these discussions, views were 
expressed that had to be harmonized on the basis of reasoning. 
We had such a useful discussion in Malanta on 5 May. In the 
end, an agreement was reached between the deputy prime minister 
and the agriculture minister and between the deputy prime 
minister and the defense minister. 
  [Krno] The election campaign is already under way 
unofficially. The HZDS has set a specific tone from the 
beginning. What are your views on the preelection struggle? 
  [Weiss] We did not conduct privatization. Therefore, we 
certainly will not have enough money to place a full-page 
advertisement in the press every week from today until the end 
of September. We will present our political values and aims to 
the citizens, and we will explain how we intend to assert them. 
We intend to offer a modern European and, at the same time, 
patriotic left-wing alternative to resolving Slovakia's 
problems. That is, we will not embark on a black campaign, 
denunciation, scandal, and manipulating public opinion. Of 
course, if it is necessary to react to attacks, scandal, and 
gossip, we will do so. It is natural that we want to publish 
the SDL program in the form of advertisements in PRAVDA, as an 
independent daily with a high print run and a well-known 
structure of readers, but these will certainly not be articles 
scandalizing our political partners. That would be beneath us.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Klepac Took a Risk"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--"The extraordinary nature of this 
period, in which the further orientation of independent Slovakia 
is being decided, requires extraordinary decisions and deeds. 
The formation of a Christian bloc in Slovak politics would 
constitute such a deed. Unfortunately Jan Carnogursky [chairman 
of the Christian Democratic Movement, KDH] proved unable to rise 
above the feeling of having been personally hurt and to give 
priority to a higher moral principle." This is stated in a 
statement issued by the Christian Social Union [KSU] in response 
to the KDH chairman's remark that the KSU should not run in the 
parliamentary elections. KSU Chairman Jan Klepac informed 
reporters about this statement yesterday. The KSU is of the 
opinion that Slovakia, where 70 percent of the population 
declares itself Christian, needs a strong Christian political 
party. It would be a response to the formation of the left-wing 
bloc and the ethnic Hungarian bloc, in which Hungarian 
communists, Christians, and liberals managed to join forces. 
The KSU chairman submitted this proposal to Jan Carnogursky 
three weeks ago, even though he was taking the risk of arousing 
the disagreement of some KSU members who have still not 
forgotten that KDH deputies voted against the Declaration of 
Sovereignty and the Slovak Constitution. 
  [Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 May on page 3 carries a 
250-word "dos"-signed report on the KSU briefing. The report 
includes the following passage: "Jan Klepac assessed negatively 
the fact that the KDH is offering places on its slate of 
candidates to `cosmopolitans and exponents of Czechoslovakism.' 
In his opinion, by opening up to atheism, the KDH is losing its 
Christian character. The KSU chairman also reacted to reports 
according to which the Slovak National Party Central Council 
considers a coalition with the KSU possible only without its 
chairman and deputy chairman. `Should this be the case, it would 
be intolerable interference in the internal affairs of another 
political entity,' the KSU chairman said."]

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Krno: "Preferences for Possible </F>
Coalitions"] 
  [Text] Yesterday we managed to obtain the fresh results of 
a representative survey of preelection preferences conducted by 
Slovak Radio's Methodological Research Department from 2 to 10 
May 1994. A total of 1,065 respondents were asked to reply to 
several questions, of which the following attracted our 
attention: "Several parties and movements consider forming 
coalitions for the parliamentary elections. How would you vote 
if the parties and movements contested the elections grouped 
together in the following coalitions....?" 
  Three political groupings would acquire more votes than if 
its individual components went into the elections independently. 
The coalition of right-wing and liberal parties--Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH], Democratic Party [DS], National 
Democratic Party [NDS], Democratic Union [DU], and Party of 
Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen [SPZ]--would receive 13 percent of 
the votes of all respondents (15.7 percent of the votes of those 
who are determined to vote). The coalition of left-wing and 
social democratic parties--Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], 
Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], Green Party in 
Slovakia [SZS], and Farmers Movement of the Slovak Republic [HP 
SR]--would receive 15.1 percent (18.2). And the coalition of 
ethnic Hungarian parties--Coexistence, Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement [MKDH], and Hungarian Civic Party 
[MOS]--would receive 7.5 percent (9.1). The bloc of nationally 
oriented parties--Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], 
Slovak National Party [SNS], and Christian Social Union 
[KSU]--on the other hand, would receive 19.9 percent of the vote 
(24.1 percent); that is less than if the HZDS, the formerly 
ruling movement, opted for an independent ticket. Some "other 
coalition or party" was preferred by 4.7 percent of respondents. 
  As many as 22.5 percent of respondents were unable to state 
their preferences. Obviously, a fierce preelection struggle 
will be waged for this more than one-fifth of undecided voters.

elections was signed in Kosice yesterday by representatives of 
the five largest Romany parties and movements from east and 
central Slovakia. In concluding the agreement, the chairmen of 
the Romany Congress, the Romany Civic Initiative, the Union of 
the Romany Civic Initiative, the Romany Party of Social 
Democracy, and the Party of Integration of Romanies proceeded 
from their parties' failure in the last elections, which was 
caused by their own fragmentation. There are at present eight 
political parties and 12 cultural associations of Romanies in 
Slovakia associating almost 90 percent of the 520,000 Romanies, 
most of whom live in eastern Slovakia. According to the parties 
to the agreement, they also contemplate joining an electoral 
coalition but have not yet decided on a partner.

active again," states a statement issued by the Green Party in 
Slovakia (SZS), which SZS Deputy Chairman Pavol Fabian made 
available to the TA SR yesterday. Three party members decided 
to leave the SZS before the coming elections and have launched a 
petition campaign, the aim of which is to register the 
"genuinely Slovak Green Party." One of the founders of the new 
party is a former SZS member, who was recently caught as she 
unlawfully manipulated the registration cards of SZS members. 
[passage omitted] Only 17 days after this incident, she set up 
the new party. According to the SZS Presidium, the three 
signatories of the appeal for the establishment of the new party 
distinguished themselves by minimal activism in protecting the 
environment, and their departure represents no loss for the SZS 
from this viewpoint.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Prekopova: "Still Marxist-Leninist"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Levice--The welcoming of delegations of 
communist and workers parties from the Czech Republic, China, 
the DPRK, Vietnam, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Russia, Ukraine, 
and Cuba marked the opening of the First Congress of the 
Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS] in Levice on 14 May. The KSS 
was established in 1992 through the merger of the KSS '91 and 
the Union of Communists of Slovakia. 
  KSS Chairman Vladimir Dado stressed that the party's 
membership base has considerably increased of late, with many 
young people joining the party. According to Dado, 6,123 
members are working in the party's more than 200 primary 
organizations. The congress approved the preservation of the 
party's orientation toward Marxist-Leninist principles and 
subscribed to the program of the Lubochna congress [of 
Marxist-Leninist Social Democrats from Slovakia] of 73 years 
ago. The KSS regards itself as a party of workers, farmers, and 
the intelligentsia and relies, in particular, on "the workers' 
class and the youth." It assesses the post-1989 development as 
a path of class-motivated revenge and the restoration of 
capitalism by force. Vladimir Dado regretted the unwillingness 
of the Party of the Democratic Left, the Social Democrats, and 
the Association of Workers of Slovakia to set up a left-wing 
bloc with the KSS. "If we do not succeed in forming a bloc, we 
will go into the elections independently," he said. During the 
debate, the media came repeatedly under heavy fire because they 
supposedly refuse to provide scope to the party. [passage 
omitted] The delegates to the two-day congress approved the 
party's program and statutes and reelected Vladimir Dado as KSS 
chairman. 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 16 May on page 2 
carries a 300-word TA SR report on the First KSS Congress. The 
report notes that the newly approved party statutes include "one 
major change in that the Executive Committee has been replaced 
by a 15-member Presidium" as the party's steering body. The 
report also mentions that "Ladislav Jaco was elected KSS central 
secretary."]

last week, the trade unionists withdrew from the General 
Agreement for 1994. Before yesterday's extraordinary Assembly 
of the Confederation of Trade Unions (KOZ), it was rumored that 
some trade union leaders disagree with this step. 
  Yesterday, KOZ changed its original statement and, in a 
statement of the KOZ Assembly that was, according to KOZ Vice 
President Vladimir Stevko, approved "by all chairmen of 
indiviudal trade unions, with one or two exceptions," it 
declared: "On the basis of the nonfulfillment of the General 
Agreement by the Slovak Government in the preceding years, KOZ 
of the Slovak Republic regards the continuing nonfulfillment of 
the General Agreement for 1994 as a reason for KOZ to cease 
being a guarantor of social peace." As KOZ representatives 
specified at a subsequent news conference, the statement does 
not imply any immediate organizing of strikes or demonstrations. 
A decision on specific steps should be made by the next 
assembly, which will be held next week. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Slovaks Balance the First Quarter"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--Over the first three months of this 
year, Slovakia reached a surplus of 2.2 billion Slovak korunas 
[Sk] in trade with the Czech Republic, Stefan Condik, chairman 
of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic (SUSR), said at 
a news conference in Bratislava yesterday. Imports from the 
Czech Republic amounted to Sk14.3 billion during this period 
(30.2 percent of the total imports to Slovakia), and goods worth 
Sk16.5 billion were exported to the Czech Republic (37.9 percent 
of total Slovak exports). These data do not include reexports, 
however. Using the statistical method according to the trading 
country, Slovakia had a deficit of Sk3.6 billion in trade with 
the Czech Republic. 
  Stefan Condik said that the trend of deceleration of the 
growth of prices emerged in Slovakia in the first quarter of 
1994. Inflation rose on the whole, according to the SUSR data 
for the first quarter, by 2.6 percent in comparison with 
December of last year, and it was to a certain degree affected 
by the development in wages. Wages in industry rose by 16.3 
percent from February to reach Sk6,291, and in construction by 
15.7 percent, to Sk5,919. Salaries in retailing rose 10 percent, 
to Sk4,714, and in transport 6.7 percent, to Sk6,119. The 
average monthly wages for the entire national economy reached 
the amount of Sk5,400 in the first quarter, which is 14 to 15 
percent (Sk700) more than in the same period last year. 
  There were 370,500 unemployed in Slovakia in March, which is 
approximately 14.7 percent of those able to work. In comparison 
with February (14.8 percent rate of unemployment), the number of 
unemployed declined by 5,500 people. 
  The effect of the introduction of the import surcharge 
became 
obvious in March, and the trade deficit rose by only Sk35 
million. The overall balance of trade ended with a deficit of 
Sk3.7 billion for the quarter. Goods worth Sk47.2 billion were 
imported to Slovakia during the first three months of the year, 
which is 1 percent more than in the same period of 1993. 
Exports amounted to Sk43.5 billion, which is a 2.6-percent drop 
in the year-to-year comparison. 
  The value of foreign capital in the Slovak economy reached 
Sk11.5 billion at the end of March. That is a 6.7-percent 
increase in comparison with the last quarter of 1993. Austria 
is responsible for the main share of investments in the Slovak 
economy (23.4 percent), followed by Germany (21 percent). The 
Czech Republic (whose share rose to 13 percent) recently passed 
the United States (12.1) percent). Foreign capital is invested 
in 5,719 companies. Since the beginning of the year, 35 firms 
with foreign capital participation closed down in Slovakia, and 
another 80 firms are being liquidated.

  [Text] The Croatian Government has not resigned and will 
not resign despite [break in transmission] as Prime Minister 
Nikica Valentic began today's government session. Nenad Stazic 
has the report. 
  [Stazic] The government has displayed a principled and 
responsible approach to its duties over the past 14 months. It 
is still a factor of stability, so the prime minister and the 
government in general will not do anything to destabilize the 
situation in Croatia. What fuelled yesterday's rumors about the 
government's possible resignation was the decision to drop items 
from the agenda of the House of Counties -- which was not the 
most ingenious solution -- so the government will not propose 
that any items be dropped from the agenda of the Chamber of 
Representatives [break in transmission].

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stijepo Martinovic: "Bosnia Is Paying for </F>
Peace in Its Neighborhood?!"] 
  [Text] The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina could last for years, 
just as the one in Lebanon, but the United Nations has done much 
by containing it within Bosnia-Herzegovina and preventing it 
from spreading outside "former Yugoslavia." The UN secretary 
general recently reiterated that statement, thus contributing -- 
along with many others who hold that view -- to cementing the 
stupid but utterly lethal thesis: that the war in the former 
central Yugoslav republic was preordained owing to the 
republic's multiethnic and multicultural situation. That it is, 
therefore, an internal war, and that no one stoked up the fire 
under the "Bosnian pot," and that nobody can do anything apart 
from containing the tragedy within its "natural and ethnic 
borders." 
  First of all, that "revelation" is nothing more than a poor 
excuse, for it is more than obvious that it is most often used 
by exactly those so-called international mediators whose entire 
range of activities in the "Yugoslav crisis" is calculated to 
a crawling rehabilitation of memorandum goals and 
thereby also of means used by the greater Serbian program 
headquarters in their conquest. For, regardless of the risk 
that the war might last as long as the one in Lebanon and be 
equally destructive for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Butrus-Ghali, 
Akashi, Juppe, Hurd..., not to mention Kozyrev, say it is OK as 
long as it is contained within the borders of "former 
Yugoslavia." Even the most naive observer, though, realizes at 
least three things: 
  First, that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of 
the developed phenomenology that came later on -- did 
not begin as a tribal conflict of everybody against everyone, 
but as an aggression (both in terms of ideas and implementation) 
of joined greater Serbian forces, from outside and 
inside, against Bosnia-Herzegovina as a territorial and 
political whole and against two indigenous nations which 
unambiguously opted for its survival at an independent address 
at a referendum. 
  Second, the Bosnia-Herzegovina war did not spread 
to other areas of "former Yugoslavia" -- and to areas of early 
Yugoslav territory in particular -- only because that is 
theoretically not possible. The greater Serbian onslaught on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is conceptually significantly different from 
the staged Yugo-army aggression against Slovenia, it 
is different from the Yugoslav-Serb assault on 
Croatia, and from the Serb-allied aggression that 
Milosevic's regime designed for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. On the other hand, with regard 
to Kosovo, Sandzak, Vojvodina, Montenegro... as victims of 
greater Serbian aggression, those areas were occupied without 
war, "integrated" and Serbianized by means of a mixture of 
political and police terror and economic and social apartheid. 
The UN secretary general's fear -- and not only his -- that the 
war will spread beyond the borders of "former Yugoslavia" is 
based on utterly stretched speculations about the Balkanization 
and, subsequently, full internalization of the escalation of 
Serb state terror over the Kosovo Albanians and (or) the attempt 
to divide Macedonia among (all of) its neighbors. 
  However, neither the Kosovo Albanians give any indications 
as 
to the limits of their humiliation, nor is Macedonia -- with 
U.S. (para-)UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] soldiers 
deployed along the border with Serbia -- the prey one is allowed 
to reach for. 
  All in all, Butrus-Ghali's going into raptures over 
containing the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Croatia was evidently 
forgotten as the side to which the UN owes everything but the 
protection of the terrorist part of its Serbian minority!) is 
nebulous, to say the least. His real purpose is to convince the 
victims of greater Serbian aggression that they have the 
privilege of using their misfortune (even if it is of a Lebanese 
kind) to contribute to peace in the neighborhood of former 
Yugoslav territory. 
  True to such interpretations of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. of the "Yugoslav crisis" in general, 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali justifies the impotence of the UN to 
alleviate the suffering of the people and destruction caused by 
Serb acts of savagery by saying that, instead of 35,000 "blue 
helmets," he was only given 10,000. This is, again, not just a 
poor excuse but a very hypocritical one indeed, for as long as 
the secretary general himself is toying with the definition of 
the war, identification of the aggressor, and with imperative 
resolutions of his own house, being very careful not to smear 
his hands with truth, and as long as his plenipotentiary holds 
bandit leaders on Pale and in Knin to be "peacemakers" (and they 
have, naturally, became his "friends"!), it is more than obvious 
that the number of peacekeeping soldiers is not important, but 
the induced impotence of political decisions about using those 
soldiers on the ground is. 
  Of course, it would be wrong -- considering the number of 
people who should be given credit -- to lay all the blame for 
"Yugoslav mistakes" of international factors on the UN secretary 
general. However, his is the grandiose contribution to the 
tragedy on the territory of former Yugoslavia in that his 
actions were clear and biased and especially in the fact that he 
gave himself the privilege, as the first secretary of the world 
organization, to make independent decisions on the level of 
the president of the government of the world, which 
gives a special meaning to his lethal, though sincere, delusions.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential economic adviser Franjo </F>
Greguric by Tihomir Dujmovic; place and date not given: "We Are 
Still Offering the Serbs Oil"] 
  [Excerpt] Dr. Franjo Greguric still does not want to talk 
about current events in the incumbent party, events involving 
his party colleagues. It is quite certain that he is still 
firmly behind President Tudjman, although some in the HDZ 
[Croatian Democratic Union] say that up to now he has been close 
to what is called the left wing. Greguric is a successful 
businessman, an advocate of privatization, managing director of 
the most important firm in Croatia, and the president's economic 
adviser, and therefore always an interesting and relevant source 
of information, even when he is evading "hot" political topics. 
  [Dujmovic] Do you agree with the critics who say that 
transformation is showing that the adopted model is defective? 
Is there truth in the speculation that Croatian emigres are 
being prevented in various ways from taking part in the 
transformation? 
  [Greguric] Debate on the proposal for transformation of 
socially owned firms was conducted very temperamentally among 
the experts, in the Croatian Government, in the Croatian 
Parliament, and in many public discussions before the law was 
adopted in regular proceedings. The Law on Sale of Socially 
Owned Housing and other laws regulating the issue of commercial 
space were adopted at the same time. The law was debated during 
1991, and then it was adopted toward the end of the year. 
  The law has also been supplemented and amended on several 
occasions. When military operations spread in Croatia, new 
relations were created on Croatian soil, and they required 
serious changes in the law; among other things they have 
resulted in the gratis distribution of shares to disabled 
veterans of the homeland war and families of fighting men who 
were killed, and also exemptions in making regular payments that 
have come due for shares already purchased. That is why the law 
should be viewed dynamically over the period from its adoption 
to the present day, and it needs to be said that the Croatian 
Government and Parliament have shown an appreciation for the 
position of small shareholders, whose position actually is more 
and more difficult, and for Croatia's impoverished economy. So, 
I cannot accept the assertion that the Law is defective, 
especially since there is no ideal law for this subject matter, 
just as there is no optimum model of transformation of socially 
owned property. Every country that had a socialist system has 
been resolving the issue of transformation of ownership of 
socially owned and government-owned firms in its own way, 
adapting it to its own material and political conditions. 
  Nor is there any basis for speculation that Croatian emigres 
are being prevented from taking part in the transformation. It 
is quite certain that there has been a great deal of 
misunderstanding on both sides; the emigres expected to receive 
better information about possible purchase of shares of small 
and medium-sized firms, but the Fund and the firms involved in 
transformation proceedings did not have all the necessary 
documents prepared for quality transformation. Today the 
situation in this area is much better than it was a year or more 
ago: The Fund has put together a team of specialists, the 
enabling regulations are in place, and there is a readiness to 
quickly process the applications of our emigres. For instance, 
the Karlovac Brewery was sold to Mr. Luksic in the United 
States, Mr. Radosevic has become the owner of the former Zagreb 
Bus Factory, and many others have found ways of becoming owners 
of real estate in Croatia. 
  I mentioned the Law on Sale of Socially Owned Housing. Under 
that law 157,000 units of socially owned housing have so far 
been sold out of a total of 393,000, which under wartime 
conditions has also been a considerable contribution to 
resolving more rapidly not only the issue of privatization of 
the housing stock, but also the issue of replenishing the state 
budget. 
  [Dujmovic] As the president's adviser for the economy, 
please 
tell us whether there is any serious intention to undertake the 
process of denationalization, which has been announced for 
months now? 
  [Greguric] The process of denationalization has been debated 
in recent days by the HDZ presidium, at the request of the 
Government of the Republic of Croatia. I must say that there are 
no good reasons to fear denationalization and that too much 
mystery is being made of this term. I would like to recall once 
again that in 1991 all private applications for recovery of 
nationalized property were recorded in the government office for 
denationalization, and an immense job was done, and that is the 
basis for material assessment of the consequences of 
denationalization. Be that as it may, there is no reason for 
initiating a broad debate of the criteria for denationalization, 
especially since the beginnings of denationalization were 
envisaged by laws adopted in 1991 and 1992 -- the Law on 
Transformation of Socially Owned Enterprises and the package of 
housing laws. I think that the government has a good concept and 
it should be analyzed disinterestedly and submitted to regular 
public and parliamentary proceedings. 
  There is no ideal solution, and it cannot all be given back; 
denationalization ought to be carried out in both forms, i.e. 
the natural form, the return of real estate and property, where 
this can be done without creating new injustices; when that is 
not possible because of interests of the state and public 
interests, material compensation should be used, as is done by 
all countries in the world. In other words, we should not flee 
from denationalization but undertake a public debate and 
adoption of the law as soon as possible. 
  [Dujmovic] Will foreign oil companies be allowed to open 
service stations, and when might that happen? 
  [Greguric] The INA [Petroleum Industry] is not alone in 
marketing petroleum products on the Croatian market. You know 
that during the last quarter of last year we rented out 30 
service stations in Croatia, and after the experience we have 
had in that connection, we are thinking of renting out another 
80 service stations, subject to certain criteria. The criteria 
have been published in the daily press. Commissions consisting 
of representatives of INA, the zupanijas, and the trade unions 
have made the selection, so that in this way we have protected 
not only our own interests but also the interests of the 
employed personnel and the interests of the local authorities on 
whose territories the service stations are operating. At the 
same time, you have seen for yourself the emergence of private 
service stations; we think that this is a good thing, that it 
strengthens competition, raises the quality of services, and 
offers something more than what was offered by our stations 
alone. The Galic service station as you leave Zagreb on the 
Varazdin road is an example; along with a beautiful design, 
quality service, and facilities from a restaurant to a small 
motel, it offers everything that might attract the public. In 
addition to pumping gas, the individual may need to have his car 
washed, to buy things he needs on the trip, and to rest. This is 
also good because it stimulates a rise in the quality of 
services at our service stations. 
  Now, we already have foreign oil companies in Croatia, for 
example OMV Istrabenz, which is owned by three oil companies: 
INA, OMV and Istrabenz. Other foreign oil companies will 
probably also come, since most expect a definitive peace on our 
territory and cessation of the war in our neighborhood. Just as 
soon as lasting peace is established in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we 
are preparing to undertake intensive reconstruction and 
development of service stations on this territory as well as in 
the temporarily occupied regions of Croatia. 
  [Dujmovic] During the debate about tax regulations, some 
deputies proposed higher taxation of oil and petroleum products 
after the pattern of the Western countries. Are the estimates 
accurate that this would augment the budget by 40 percent? 
  [Greguric] There is a bill in Parliament proceedings 
concerning a special tax on petroleum products calling for 
taxation of all types of motor gasoline, diesel fuel, heating 
oil, mazut and LP gas. We consider it quite natural as part of 
the new tax system for value-added taxes to be adopted in the 
manner envisaged by the law. We can only speak about whether the 
rates of the special tax on petroleum products, so-called excise 
taxes, are comparable to similar taxes in other European 
countries. I think no reasonable person can object to payment of 
the tax, just as no reasonable person can fail to take into 
account the available technological condition of refinery 
installations for the production and refining of petroleum and 
the distribution system. It is often forgotten that we need to 
bear in mind that every country in the world must have a minimal 
energy independence and self-sufficiency, just as we must have 
it in the areas of defense and protection of the state. Under 
such conditions Croatia must have secure sources of all types of 
energy, from electric power to petroleum products. If that were 
not the case, of course, we would have had a hard time during 
this war --which, we hope, is behind us -- obtaining sufficient 
quantities of energy sources. 
  Unfortunately, the former system and Yugoslavia 
systematically depleted the Croatian oil industry. They put 
pressure through the price system on domestic oil and gas 
production and favored cheap energy on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, especially in parts which did not have 
sources of oil and gas, which means in Serbia, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Now that petroleum production in Croatia 
is practically stagnant, and the refineries are worn out because 
of low investment, we face a decision on more intense oil and 
gas exploration and rapid reconstruction and modernization of 
the refineries so that we can make optimum use of the 
professional potential and international reputation of the 
Croatian oil industry to plug it back into the advanced European 
countries. Many say that this is not necessary, since we can buy 
oil and petroleum products more cheaply, but I think that such a 
simple and one-sided short-term policy would destroy that 
industry and make Croatia completely energy-dependent, which 
must not be the policy of the young state of Croatia. 
  [Dujmovic] With respect to peaceful reintegration of the 
UNPA 
[UN Protected Areas], the issue of INA's entry into the occupied 
areas will certainly be raised soon. Do you have a program 
prepared? 
  [Greguric] In late November 1993 we submitted to the 
Parliament's commission for relations with the Serbs in the 
temporarily occupies aread of Croatia a proposal for gradually 
opening service stations. Specifically, we proposed for a start 
that service stations be opened in Okucani and Petrinja to 
supply the public in that area with INA's assortment of fuel, 
obviously at the prices in effect in the other parts of our 
homeland. We proposed payment in Croatian dinars or any other 
convertible currency. Unfortunately, there has been no response 
to that proposal. Now, we are continuing to offer it, we are 
reiterating it even through this interview. At the same time, we 
offer to use our service stations in the temporarily occupied 
areas to market fertilizer and other products that would fill 
out the shelves of our stations. It is now up to the Serbs in 
the occupied territories and the negotiating teams. The program, 
which does not need amendment, envisages delivery of the fuel 
and fertilizer and consumer goods in our vehicles, with or 
without the support of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].

<F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "What Has the State Done to </F>
Caktas?"] 
  [Excerpts] Sinisa Caktas, engineer and businessman from 
Split, co-owner and managing director of the firm Nova, is in 
custody under investigation for alleged misappropriation in the 
transformation of the Split Dairy. Caktas had big plans and 
announced a sensational purchase of Split firms undergoing 
transformation, but his arrest has halted him in creating his 
business empire. He was at the center of a conflict between the 
Fund for Privatization and the commercial courts on additional 
capitalization, which is what got Caktas into trouble, an 
unconstitutional act in the transformation process, although the 
Croatian Parliament has passed a law allowing it. The 
Constitutional Court will decide the fate of the 120 firms which 
have been sold under arrangements for additional capitalization 
and in which a great deal of money has been invested, with 
certain foreign firms among the investors. This has even been 
debated by the Fund's board of directors, and it seems that yet 
another farce in the transformation process is on the horizon. 
At the center of it is a man who announced the purchase of "half 
of Split," a man who could have become the employer of 
one-fourth of Split's employed labor force. [passages omitted] 
<H5>  Caktas' Plans </H5>
  Caktas came into prominence when he bought or announced the 
purchase of certain firms in Split that were being transformed. 
Nova first bought a complex of commercial space for 2 million 
German marks [DM] on Gunduliceva Street in Split. Then it 
purchased the firm Transsped and Adria Color by paying the 
workers cash for the shares of that firm, so that it became its 
100-percent owner. All those transactions, if we ignore rumors 
in the city, were regarded as ordinary transactions in the 
transformation until Caktas and his firm aroused public interest 
by offering to build a pontoon bridge over the Novska Gorge, 
seeking concessions for operation of the bridge in return. Aside 
from the pontoon bridge, the offer also called for building a 
new bridge above the Novska Gorge. Sensational announcements 
followed on the economic environment of Split in which Nova 
would buy shares to round out its business empire. Caktas 
announced that he was going to buy from the Fund for 
Privatization shares in Pomgrad, Dalmacijavino, the construction 
firm Lavcevic, the fishing firm Jadran, Neptun, and 
Auto-Dijelovi, with the Dairy at the end of the list. The value 
of those transactions was greater than DM150 million, and Caktas 
would have become employer of one-fourth of the employed labor 
force of Split. 
  This of course aroused great interest in Caktas, and it is 
only logical that resistance and enemies should have emerged. 
Those familiar questions began to be asked: Who is Caktas? Who 
is he working for? Whose money is it? Soon Caktas himself, in a 
statement for the media, revealed some of his business plans and 
announced that he would be buying all the industrial plants 
around the Municipal Port and moving them elsewhere to build a 
commercial center on the quay. This was one of the key 
statements that set in motion resistance to Caktas' business. 
Caktas confidently presented his plans for all these firms, and 
it is interesting that no one contested those plans with 
arguments, but there was constant speculation that Caktas would 
buy all those firms to grab up the attractive commercial space 
and construction sites in the center of the city and make money 
by doing so. Incidentally, he said that himself. However, no one 
explained what would be wrong with moving the factories from the 
center of the city to the outskirts and building commercial 
centers in the center according to urban planning and 
architectural designs prescribed by the city executive 
authority. It seems the only thing in dispute was the 
possibility of someone making money with a good idea and money 
invested. That was a bad thing in the former system as well. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Additional Capitalization Contested </H5>
  This is only one of the drastic conflicts between government 
agencies and the courts, which are sometimes waged over the 
backs of the businessmen and small shareholders. This time the 
dispute is over additional capitalization of the firms, an issue 
on which the courts and the Fund cannot agree. The Fund feels 
that additional capitalization is acceptable and indeed 
desirable, since it stimulates investment in the firms. The 
buyers can in this way enlarge their capital holding and gain 
the controlling block of stock, but the firm also gets equipment 
and money to facilitate its operation. The small shareholders 
and the trade unions in particular consider this form of 
purchase thievery and a threat to the rights of the small 
stockholders. The presiding judges of the commercial courts have 
met to debate this problem, since some courts have refused to 
enter such firms in the court register. That is what happened to 
Caktas in connection with the purchase of the Dairy. In short, 
the courts judged that this was unconstitutional and a flagrant 
violation of the rights of the other shareholders. The Fund of 
course defended the entire idea, and the decision on all this is 
to be made by the Constitutional Court. This has also been 
debated by the Government, and after that session the Supreme 
Commercial Court ordered the lower courts to resume entering 
those firms in the court register, and if the Constitutional 
Court proclaims this unconstitutional, the firms will be deleted 
from the register. But the Commercial Court in Split did not 
want to enter the Dairy in the court register even after that 
intervention. 
  So far there have been about 120 cases of additional 
capitalization. The Parliament has in fact allowed this in 
amendments to the Law on Transformation, but now this 
privatization procedure, which involves the investment of a 
great deal of domestic and foreign capital, is in jeopardy. If 
the Constitutional Court says that additional capitalization is 
unconstitutional, 120 various investors will be in a fix. How is 
the money invested to be returned and interest paid on it, and, 
especially, how are they to collect for the time and work 
invested in the firm's business operation? Or, if the court 
decides otherwise, who is going to compensate Caktas, and how? 
  The sale of firms is debatable anyway, since this right has 
been left to the "magnificent 13" on the Fund's board of 
directors, who can sell or preserve for the state the shares of 
the great majority of Croatian firms as they see fit, with no 
accountability and without any clear strategy for development of 
the Croatian economy. The case of additional capitalization 
calls into question once again the way in which Croatian firms 
are being transformed, and it could greatly diminish the 
interest of domestic businessmen in making an investment. Not to 
mention foreign investors.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Beric: "The Guards Have Gone, the Company Has </F>
Remained"] 
  [Text] Erdut, 25 April -- While the Serbian Volunteer 
Guards [SDG] of Zeljko Arkan Raznatovic were on the territory of 
the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and its main body was 
stationed at the training center in Erdut, a gasoline station 
was built at the approach to Erdut, a new commercial building 
was built, and Dafina Milanovic promised additional investments. 
  A firm named Dafiment Centar was established in a joint 
venture with Dafina Milanovic, and Dafina Milanovic herself 
visited Erdut twice, where she met representatives of the RSK 
government. In the presence of then RSK president Goran Hadzic 
and Zeljko Arkan Raznatovic, she promised to invest large 
amounts to update industrial and agricultural production, 
primarily on the territory of eastern Slavonia and western Srem. 
  Following the well-known events that befell Dafiment Bank, 
there was no longer any talk about any investment, but the 
business facility at the entrance to Erdut was entirely 
completed. However, when the training center in Erdut was 
abandoned, and when the SDG left the territory of the RSK, 
especially after the feature article published in DUGA and 
certain statements by Dafina Milanovic, stories emerged in 
public about the fate of the facility that had been built, about 
its origin, about its present owner, and so on. 
  Various stories began to circulate in the local population 
even before the SDG left Erdut. According to some, the investors 
and owners of the facility no longer wanted even a financial 
presence in the RSK, and they were looking for a buyer for that 
facility to recoup at least some of their money. According to 
others, the owners of the facility had up to that point already 
been making maximum use of their presence in the RSK and had 
derived financial gain, so that the fate of the facility was not 
even very important to them. However, Stojan Novakovic, who owns 
90 percent of the shares and is president of the SDG Company in 
Erdut, categorically denies all such stories. 
  "The SDG is the Guards, and SDG Company is a company, and 
there is no connection between them," says Stojan Novakovic. 
"The company is registered with the economic court of the RSK in 
Beli Manastir as SDG Company Erdut, Joint-Stock Company. With 
its presence in this area, the company plans to work for 
improvement of the RSK economy by changing the old style of 
economic management, above all in agriculture. The company has a 
plan for doing that, but real economic relations have not yet 
evolved in Krajina, above all because of the danger of war and 
battles between political parties." 
  According to Stojan Novakovic, the SDG Company began in 1992 
to build a business facility and invested more than $3 million 
in it. This is a business facility consisting of a gasoline 
station with a capacity of 400,000 liters, a railroad junction 
immediately alongside the facility, and a commercial building 
built to all European standards with 2,300 square meters of 
floor space. The commercial building itself, according to Stojan 
Novakovic, consists of a production shop with an area of 760 
square meters intended for wood manufacturing, and then a large 
warehouse and office with an area of 760 square meters. There 
are also a duty-free shop, a restaurant, and a bank in the 
building, and the entire project is appraised at $10 million. 
  "In a joint investment Dafina Milanovic and I established 
the 
firm Dafiment Centar, but Mrs. Milanovic did not fulfill all her 
obligations," says Stojan Novakovic. "Under the contract Mrs. 
Milanovic was supposed to invest $3 million. We will continue to 
invest, but as for the funds and debts of Mrs. Milanovic, we 
will have to talk about that with her and straighten out 
relations." 
  Stojan Novakovic, the company's president and investor, says 
that he plans to build a greenhouse with an area of 40 hectares 
in the vicinity of geothermal springs, where he will be 
concerned with plant genetics and the development of new 
varieties of highly profitable farm products. The president of 
this company also says that he personally did the design of the 
free trade zone and port in Vukovar and that he is ready to 
offer business associates the best terms for construction of the 
zone. In a very short time the duty-free shop, bank, restaurant, 
production shop, and warehouse will also begin to operate in the 
new commercial building in Erdut. 
  "I am saying all this because certain political parties and 
individuals, pursuing their own petty political points, misuse 
construction of this business facility, referring to us all as 
war profiteers," Stojan Novakovic says. "But I wonder whether 
any war profiteer invested $3 million in an unsafe area. If I 
had built this facility on the Belgrade-Novi Sad highway, I 
would have had 1,000 times more traffic, and the facility would 
have been worth 50 times more. Once again I put the question -- 
is that war profiteering or patriotism?"

  [Excerpt] At a session chaired by Mirko Marjanovic, the 
Government of the Republic of Serbia concluded that the stable 
conditions for economic activity have been successfully 
maintained in the three and a half months since the beginning of 
the implementation of the economic program. The exchange rate 
of the dinar is unchanged and is accompanied by a gradual 
increase in foreign exchange reserves and industrial output, 
which was up 2.7 percent in April. 
  The deficit in the republican budget is being reduced, as is 
total public expenditure. Average wages and other earnings have 
increased in real terms. In the first two weeks of May there 
was a slight increase in retail prices and the prices of 
agricultural products at vegetable markets. 
  Accepting the report on the results achieved in the 
implementation of the program of reconstruction of the monetary 
system and the strategy of economic recovery of Yugoslavia, the 
government concluded that the faster adaptation of companies and 
banks to the requirements of the market, the strengthening of 
financial discipline and legal security, the elimination of 
illegal financial transactions, and the rationalization in the 
sphere of public spending are of key importance in the second 
stage of the program's implementation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Radovan Pavlovic: "Bokan and Pelovic on </F>
Volunteers' Difficulties"] 
  [Text] One of the anecdotes retold most frequently during 
the fierce conflicts in Croatia and having to do with the role 
and participation of some of the Serbian volunteers in the 
homeland war went something like this: "Have you heard that ... 
was badly wounded?," with the blank filled in with the name of 
one of the many commanders of volunteer units. The uninformed 
would of course answer in the negative and ask in surprise: How 
and where? "Well, on the front, in a mopping-up operation a 
television set fell on his foot." 
  This anecdote, with its obvious moral, is like a summary of 
the criticism that has been publicly expressed about the 
participation of volunteers in military operations. It did of 
course go further than that, and the Serbian fighters were 
accused of having gone off to war with a single motivation 
--looting. To some extent a climate was even created to the 
effect that those going off to battle voluntarily were mainly 
people from the wrong side of the law and that under the guise 
of "mopping up" they were collecting for this operation, which 
is the most dangerous operation in a war anyway, by hauling off 
expensive and valuable things -- gold, equipment, and 
automobiles. 
  In some battle areas there were even special units, not made 
up exclusively of volunteers of course, whom observers 
scornfully referred to as "vultures." When the forces of the 
federal army passed, "patrols" would arrive equipped with 
special peacetime vehicles for loading up plundered booty. There 
is no doubt that all the belligerents suffered from this virus, 
and the credit for this kind of "mopping up" should go not only 
to the volunteers, but also to the local people where the 
battles were waged, as well as to certain units of the former 
JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], which a military court has been 
and is now concerned with. 
  What is said about the behavior of the fighting men by some 
of the commanders and responsible officers of the numerous 
volunteer units which, under various names and referred to as 
Serbian guards, with chetnik insignia and other national 
symbols, waged war in Croatia and Bosnia? 
  Major Borislav Pelevic of the Serbian Volunteer Guards 
[SDG], 
better known as Arkan's Tigers, says that there is looting and 
crime in every war, but that the volunteers who put their lives 
at risk because of Serbian ideals should not be sullied because 
of the acts of a few. Pelevic says of the Tigers that they came 
out of every action with their honor bright and that there were 
no cases of looting or any crime against civilians and prisoners 
in the ranks of the SDG. Our informant explained that iron 
discipline was enforced among the Tigers. There was a soldier's 
code which all had to abide by. The most popular penalty for 
those who messed up was the old and well-known folk punishment: 
25 lashes on the bare buttocks. Alcohol was strictly 
prohibited. If anyone was found to have had a drink, he would 
get the prescribed "ration" of lashes in front of the entire 
formation, Pelevic said, illustrating it for us. But anyone who 
got drunk would be expelled from the guards. 
  In three years of waging war, Pelevic relates, there was one 
Guard member who took some gloves. This Tiger received 25 lashes 
at the point where the back loses its honorable name, and he was 
expelled from the Guards. 
  Dragoslav Bokan objects to volunteers returning from the 
battlefield never being asked where and how they waged war, but 
what they brought back. He says of the White Eagles ("because of 
what I said, they died for Serbia, while others only called for 
war in fiery nationalistic speeches"), but they did not fight a 
war between whites and blacks. "We did not distinguish who were 
Muslims and Croats, which houses were theirs. The local people 
where we fought knew that, both who was rich and where people 
were hiding things." Bokan says that the local people in those 
areas formed their own militia, a new military-police caste 
which issued permits for carrying away goods, weapons, and 
automobiles. 
  Bokan says that the looting occurred in three waves and that 
the thieves were not confined to the volunteers. In the first 
wave the looters were deserters, those who were fleeing from the 
whirlwind of war; the regular army benefited from the second 
phase and took away some things under the guise of transferring 
military equipment and armament; and after them the local people 
and their militia made their contribution. 
  Our informants agree that those returning from the front 
encounter spiritual chaos -- no one asks you about your wounds, 
but what you stole, Bokan says. Instead of welcoming words, they 
are met with accusations; hungry fighting men, discharged from 
their jobs, look upon them with suspicion; and the peacetime 
thieves deliver moral lectures to them, Bokan believes, adding 
that that is why many fighting men "crack" and have difficulty 
adapting. The only survivors will be the volunteers who are 
ideologically aware and who are ready to put up with all that, 
Bokan warns.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Stojkovic: "Heroes on the Wrong Side of the </F>
Law"] 
  [Text] The civil war, disintegration of Yugoslavia, 
economic crisis, and the crisis of ethics have led to the 
emergence of what is called the Vukovar syndrome, the domestic 
version of the post-Vietnam era in the United States. Many 
people, mostly young, have fought these last years on 
battlefields, some as volunteers and others as members of 
military units, where they have witnessed horrors, massacres, 
killings and destruction. When some of them return from the 
battlefield, they face unsurmountable problems of unemployment 
and feelings of rejections and of being unable to fit into 
society, so that many often decide to try their luck at fitting 
in by operating outside the law. Many have been charged and 
convicted of serious crimes in our country: murder, grand 
larceny, unlawful possession of firearms. 
  The most recent example is that of Ilija Vujic, accused of 
having murdered Vera Zidic and her son in an apartment in 
Pohorska Street in Belgrade. The Pohorska Street case stirred up 
the public, especially after Vujic's statement in the 
investigation that he fired at Vera Zudic without reflection, 
deliberately wounding her so that she would tell him where the 
foreign currency was. From what we have learned in the Palace of 
Justice, he has stated that he fired at Vera Zidic's son without 
deliberation, as soon as he saw him. This is only one example 
but the experts, the legal theoreticians and practitioners, say 
that a new and still more cruel crime wave generated by the 
Vukovar syndrome we mentioned threatens our country only when 
the war is entirely over. 
<H5>  Unaware of Crimes </H5>
  "I think this Vukovar syndrome has grown beyond the limits 
of 
the post-Vietnam syndrome, since these boys, at least those whom 
I have defended before the court, are not even aware that they 
have committed a crime. I think we are dealing with a big 
problem of society here, and I think we ought to organize 
collective treatment of many volunteers and members of the 
military who took part in this war. They have witnessed 
horrifying massacres. The problem is that the police meet many 
of these returnees from the war at the border, take away their 
weapons and question them, although they have a permit from the 
Srpska republic to carry them. It is no wonder that they are 
often charged with the crime of assaulting an official. A large 
number have also been convicted of unlawful possession of 
firearms and of creating a general hazard. There have been 
frequent examples of shots being fired in restaurants and the 
like," says lawyer Borivoje Borovic. 
  According to him, there are even examples of disabled 
returnees from the battlefield being convicted of some of these 
crimes. Since many of them, Borovic says, do not have a job or 
anything to live on, they feel rejected and are unable to adapt. 
There have been many cases, Borovic says, when those who have 
been convicted, wounded and disabled unfortunates, go back to 
the battlefield after serving their sentence and lose their 
lives there. 
  "All the lads I have defended were actually real heroes on 
the battlefield. However, the horrors they experienced and the 
welcome they received from our authorities had such an effect on 
them that they have rebelled. I feel that the weapons permits 
issued to the boys in the Srpska republic should be honored here 
in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] as well. However, 
the view of the court applying the famous Article 33 of the Law 
on Firearms is that those permits are not valid, and thus many 
of them have been convicted of this. The police do not issue 
weapons permits to many of these lads, and they take them into 
custody for questioning. There is the well-known case of Zvonko 
Osmajlic, whom the police in Subotica tried to frame in a murder 
case. Even when he was released and the charges dropped, the 
police took away his passport, supposedly because they were 
unhappy with the court's action," Borovic says. 
<H5>  Sad Tales </H5>
  He says that the penalties for the crimes of inflicting 
serious and light physical harm are increased in decisions of, 
say, the Superior Court when returnees from the battlefield are 
involved. Borovic says that under the influence of the Vukovar 
syndrome the young men commit serious crimes with elements of 
violence, and he says that in these cases forensic psychiatric 
evaluation often finds that they were in a pathological 
emotional state at the time they committed the crime. 
  In the past few years "blunderbuss" grenades have flown 
around in Belgrade, immense quantities of arms have been found, 
and many serious robberies have been committed. The question is 
what is the main reason for this. 
  "These lads are returning from the battlefield, but actually 
they have nothing to come back to. The first contact with the 
state is in practice the encounter with the police. They are 
treated as though they have come from another country. The case 
of Nebojsa Markovic, for example, is interesting. He is a 
volunteer who returned from the battlefield and was sentenced to 
4 1/2 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter in the death 
of his friend Vladimir Tadic. They were together in a group, 
there was drinking, there were some verbal exchanges. Nebojsa 
had a Scorpion automatic pistol and that is how this tragedy 
occurred. Those returning from the battlefield should be told as 
soon as they enter the country what awaits them here with 
respect to the law, the possibility of fitting into normal life, 
and weapons regulations. One man who was convicted provides a 
typical example. He was carrying a grenade because he did not 
know where to turn it in. He did not dare to leave it at home, 
fearing someone might get hurt, and so in the end it was 
activated when he was carrying it around and caused an 
accident," says Miroslav Todorovic, judge at the Belgrade 
District Court. 
  According to Todorovic, the veterans are usually convicted, 
and the crimes are usually serious cases of robbery, murder and 
unlawful possession of firearms. He emphasizes that the Law on 
Weapons treats this area too severely, since an individual need 
only have in his possession a pistol planted on him by someone 
else, say, or one he is carrying, say, with papers from the 
Srpska republic, and he will be convicted and punished very 
severely, although it has not been established whether he had 
any intention of using it for any purpose whatsoever. 
  All of these problems -- the legal confusion, war in the 
vicinity, the disorganized state of society, and the 
insufficient attention paid to the many young people who through 
no fault of their own were compelled to take up arms and 
participate in a bloody war with the blessing of the state -- 
threaten, once the civil war is over, to engender a still larger 
number of crimes and turn many sound and able young men into 
potential criminals on the wrong side of the law.

  [Text] Podgorica, 18 May (TANJUG) -- Talks were held today 
between Momir Bulatovic, Montenegrin president and member of the 
Supreme Defense Council, and top Yugoslav Army officers. At the 
talks, they concluded that officers and commands of the Yugoslav 
Army have displayed a high degree of responsibility for the 
overall combat readiness of their troops under very complex 
circumstances. 
  As it has been announced, the commanders of the First, 
Second, and Third Armies -- Generals Jevrem Cokic, Bozidar 
Babic, and Dusan Samardzic respectively -- General Ljubisa 
Velickovic, commander of the Air Force and anti-aircraft 
defense, and Navy Commander Admiral Dojcilo Isakovic informed 
Bulatovic about the level of combat readiness of the strategic 
formations under their command, the implementation of measures 
set by the Supreme Defense Council relating to the security of 
the state territory under present conditions, further 
transformation of the Yugoslav Army, and other issues. 
  Stable financing, in line with the capabilities of the 
state, 
will enable the speedier resolution of problems in supplying 
units with state-of-the-art equipment and in securing better 
living standards for the Yugoslav Army.

<F P=106> [Report by Novak Vulic: "From Loser to Accomplice"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The merchant navy is in agony! We reported 
this almost eight months ago, yet the spasm and fear of losing 
the fleet is increasingly great. The immense effort of the 
Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidba companies and the state 
to improve the position of the shipping trade with loans 
essentially boils down to buying time. Chances of the fleet 
surviving until the end of the year are realistic only if the 
government decision on a $30 million loan is implemented. In 
addition to the loan, saving the installations that are of 
strategic interest for Montenegro (and therefore, for the 
federal state) also call for the immediate end of the embargo. 
Since chances for a change of policy are slim, there remains 
only a glimmer of hope that perhaps one day at least a part of 
the vessels of the current fleet will sail under our flag. 
  On the eve of the second anniversary of UN Security Council 
Resolution 820, the Montengrin fleet is poorer by four vessels, 
while the threat of a mortgage and auction is looming over the 
bow of the remaining 37. Ships age faster than people, they 
diminish in value, sailing ability, and the ability for equal 
market competition. Debts, on the other hand, like all 
misfortunes, progressively multiply and oppress. It was warned 
long before the first results of the international isolation 
were apparent that a moored boat was the most expensive for its 
owner. It was also warned that a loss of sailors would ensure. 
And that the moorings in the Bar harbor and the docks of the 
Bijela Shipyard were already too quiet, even without boats. In 
the course of last year, the amount of goods that passed through 
the "southern gates of the Balkans" corresponded to the amount 
that in normal circumstances is unloaded in a matter of 15 days. 
For the sake of not completely forgetting work after the 
overhaul of the Sumadija [name of vessel], in Bijela nowadays 
they keep themselves busy with occasional interventions on 
smaller vessels. The majority of employees are on compulsory 
leave. Since there is no way of charging fees for services 
rendered, the shipyard regularly applies for assistance with 
payment of the minimal salaries. All development programs have 
been postponed and are already covered with a thick layer of 
dust. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  The Effect of the Sanctions </H5>
  Up until the sanctions, the maritime economy contributed to 
a 
fifth of the foreign currency revenue in the republic. 
  The information on losses accrued under sanctions still 
treats results achieved after surveying the situation at the end 
of October as current. The amount involved is $217 million, but 
only for maritime companies. However, we need at least to add 
to this the $60,000 for daily maintenance of vessels and loans 
from domestic sources, which also need to be repaid. 
  In line with a decision of the Montenegrin and Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia's governments, by the end of October and 
on various bases, the maritime economy was granted almost $15 
million. 
  It is interesting, for example, that former Montenegrin 
companies Jugooceanija and Prekookeanska Plovidbva (in the 
meantime they changed their flags, reregistered, and changed 
their mooring port), in addition to calculating losses on 
freight which amounted to almost $100 million, also registered 
and calculated losses incurred by devaluation of property. The 
result can only surprise the uninformed. By the end of October 
1993, it surpassed $35 million. This will rapidly increase, 
because after two years of being moored, vessels are more ruined 
than if they had been in use for five years.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 19 (TANJUG) -- The speaker of the 
Bosnian Serb republic parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, said on 
Wednesday that the cochairmen of the conference on the former 
Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, have agreed with 
the stand of the leadership of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) 
that the maps, determined in Geneva on May 13, significantly 
encroach upon the integrity of the R.S. and promised they would 
work on a better solution. 
  The formula of the European Union on the division of the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina was accepted at 
the ministerial meeting in Geneva, where agreement on a joint 
strategy towards the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina was reached. 
Under the E.U. formula, 51 percent of the total 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory would go to the Bosnian 
Moslem-Croat federation, agreed in Washington under U.S. 
pressure, while the Serbs would get the remaining 49 percent. 
  "With regret I conveyed to the cochairmen the conference on 
former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, the stand that the 
presented maps seriously encroach upon the vital interests of 
the Serb people because they have been made to satisfy the 
Moslem-Croat side and not all three sides," Krajisnik said in a 
statement to Radio Jagodina. 
  Taking into consideration that the proposed maps encroach 
upon the integrity of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the fact 
that they are a poor solution if quality is taken into 
consideration, it will be, as Krajisnik said, very difficult to 
arrive to a just solution, i.e. a consensus. 
  The cochairmen promised they would convey the objections 
voiced by the Serb side to the contact group for Bosnia, 
Krajisnik said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak by Amir </F>
Hodzic in Geneva; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Zubak, [words indistinct] of the 
negotiations between the Bosniak and the Croatian sides? 
  [Zubak] I think that the issues that we discussed in Vienna 
were in fact the most difficult ones, and the most testing ones 
for the implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, for 
the implementation of the Federation Constitution. This is of 
utmost significance since we have now overcome the most 
difficult problems. 
  [Hodzic] You were here in Geneva for the meeting of the 
contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina. How would you comment on 
their joint statement? 
  [Zubak] That communique issued by the European Union, that 
is, [words indistinct] and the United States, is completely in 
line with what we agreed on. However, it is questionable in 
those parts where it refers to possible territory for the 
Federation after the demarcation, that is, if the [word 
indistinct] accept to join it. As far as I personally am 
concerned, I think that the Federation has to be a geopolitical 
whole, to be tenable, that is, that it can function as a state 
community. It has to have communications and road connections, 
it has to be economically strong enough to provide security for 
its citizens, and a standard of living that is normal, that is, 
a standard of living that is equal to the European one. 
  [Hodzic] In your view, what are the next top priority tasks 
[words indistinct] in order to implement the Federation 
Constitution and the Vienna Agreement on the ground? 
  [Zubak] You see, I have maintained [pauses] I am one of 
those who is against deadlines of six months for the 
implementation of the Constitution since I believe that this is 
unrealistic. I still believe that [word indistinct] the cease- 
fire holds, and then we can [words indistinct] for the 
Federation. Anything hasty or ill-prepared [words indistinct] 
could possibly cause incidents [words indistinct]. That is why 
I believe that we should -- as agreed in Vienna -- first adopt 
[word indistinct] at the Constitutional Assembly, then explain 
to the people the advantages of the new political and 
territorial demarcation, and then go into further implementation 
of the Vienna Agreement. 
  [Hodzic] Do you think there will be problems on the ground 
in implementing the Vienna Agreement? 
  [Zubak] Well, you see, there is a need to talk to the 
people, give them information, provide them with explanations 
[words indistinct] the Constitution, and everything that we have 
agreed on. Once the people are told, I do not believe that 
there will be any problems with the implementation, either with 
the Bosniak people or the Croatian people. 
  [Hodzic] Thank you very much.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 18 May (TANJUG) -- Eleven members of 
the French humanitarian organization Premiere Urgence were 
released from detention on bail today, although criminal charges 
against them have not been dropped, [Bosnian] Serbian military 
sources in Lukavica told TANJUG today. Following a decision by 
the republic of Srpska military authorities, they were released 
from detention and left the territory of the republic of Srpska 
at around 1600. According to the republic of Srpska's military 
tribunal, the French aid workers released today must neither 
leave their place of permanent residence nor go into hiding.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 18 (AFP) -- Eleven French aid 
workers detained for over a month by Bosnian Serbs for alleged 
arms trafficking were freed and flown out of Sarajevo on 
Wednesday [18 May] after payment of $44,000. In Paris, a 
spokeswoman for the charity group Premiere Urgence (Emergency 
Aid), which sent them into Bosnia-Hercegovina, denied that the 
4,000 dollars a head paid by the organisation for their release 
was a ransom. 
  The sum was "too small to be considered as a ransom," said 
spokeswoman Pascale de Lomas. She said rather that the money 
was "bail" which allowed the Bosnian Serbs to "save face." The 
Serbs' demand for payment, which "resembles a racket," had 
caused much heart-searching at the charity, she added. [passage 
omitted] 
  A communique issued by the French Foreign Ministry said the 
release came after "direct pressure from Paris and (Bosnia) on 
the main parties concerned." French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe had several contacts with the authorities of rump 
Yugoslavia and sent the foreign ministry's general secretary, 
Bertrand Dufourq, to Belgrade to negotiate a release. 
Ambassador Jacolin had daily contacts with the group, the 
statement added. 
  The Foreign Ministry said contacts had also been made with 
France's main western partners as well as Russia, European Union 
president Greece, and the cochairman of the peace conference on 
the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, and UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali to help end the aid workers' 40-day ordeal. 
France "thanks those who helped," the statement added. [passage 
omitted] 
  On Tuesday, a day before the release, Patricia Ettouati, the 
only woman in the group, wrote to the bishop of the Normandy 
town of Evreux, Jacques Gaillot, that the Serbs were "champions 
in psychological destruction."

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 19 (AFP) -- A UN 
flight landed safely at Tuzla airport Thursday, two days after 
Bosnian Serb artillery shelled the airport when another UN plane 
landed there, UN spokesman Jens Kirk said. No damage was caused 
in that incident, but the plane took off abruptly as the eight 
shells thudded in. Captain Kirk, of the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR), said another plane would land at the airport 
Thursday afternoon if no shelling took place. The mainly Moslem 
Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the UNPROFOR 
on March 22. Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for UN 
forces stationed here landed at the airport through April 14, 
but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.

in the Travnik area as grenades launched from the aggressor's 
positions in Mt. Vlasic started to fall on the town. Residential 
buildings and civilians were targeted. In the Zenica region the 
aggressor launched 17 grenades that have injured two people 
since morning. It has also been noticed that the aggressor is 
integrating new forces. The joint aggressor was attacking Bihac 
and nearby towns this morning. He was joined by the members of 
the paramilitary forces of the so-called Serbian autonomous 
region of Krajina. The civilians targets and the forward lines 
of combat in the Cazin region and in other towns have been 
attacked by Fikret Abdic's paramilitary formations.

  [Text] The enemy offensive on Mount Majevica is not 
abating. What is more, it is becoming increasingly intensive by 
the day. Civilian houses are increasingly being targeted by the 
enemy. According to reports that arrived this afternoon from the 
East Bosnian corps of the army of the Serbian republic, today, 
the 8th day of the offensive, the enemy has fired more than 200 
shells at the Stolice relay station and stepped up 
infantry-artillery attacks on Piperi and Miroslavci, north of 
Lopare, from the direction of Celic. Members of NATO today 
wholeheartedly extended help in the latest Muslim offensive on 
Majevica. They have been carrying out intensive reconnaissance 
flights and breaking the sound barrier by flying low around this 
mountain. Despite the strong attacks, the Serbian positions 
have remained unaltered. As we have learned, there were no 
casualties among the Serbian fighters. As we report, which is 
shortly before 1500, the fighting is still going on.

  [Text] Doboj, May 18 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces were on 
Wednesday [18 May] attacking Bosnian Serb positions on the 
fronts in northeastern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serb 
army command in Doboj reported the most violent attacks as being 
on the Teslic front in the northeast, where Moslems launched two 
abortive infantry attacks. Doboj's residential areas came under 
artillery fire, which fortunately claimed no casualties. 
  Moslem troop movements were reported south of Doboj, on the 
Ozren front and along the Banovici-Olovo line. The U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is increasingly blatantly supporting 
the Moslems, the statement said. During Moslem attacks on 
Tuesday night, UNPROFOR armoured cars would light the Serb 
positions in the Bradinja area, which would then be subjected to 
strong small-arms fire, the statement said. The Moslem 
offensive on Mt Majevica in the vicinity of the U.N.-designated 
Moslem 'safe area' of Tuzla shows no sign of abating, with 
civilian facilities becoming the favourite targets, the local 
Bosnian Serb army command said. On Wednesday, the eighth day of 
the Moslem offensive on Mt Majevica, the Moslems fired more than 
200 shells on the Stolice television relay and intensified 
artillery and infantry assaults on other points in the area. 
  Bosnian Serb positions were not moved, however, nor were 
there casualties among the Serb troops. The statement further 
said that the Moslem offensive was receiving wholehearted 
support also from NATO, whose planes buzzed the area on 
low-flying reconnaissance missions, breaking the sound barrier. 
  The area of Bijeljina in the east, 20 km from the border 
with 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), was on air-raid alert until 
around 8 P.M. 
  In central Bosnia, two Moslem units attempted attacks on the 
Serb positions 15 km from Kupres in the morning, but sustained 
heavy casualties and retired in disorder in the direction of 
Bugojno in the southwest. The local Serb army had no losses in 
life or limb, army sources said.

  [Text] Sarajevo has had another relatively quiet day. The 
chetniks fired with small arms at members of the UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] in Kozija Cuprija, but they returned fire. 
Apart from the use of a portable rocket launcher against 
Dobrinja Five, several explosions were also heard near the 
airport. Regrouping of enemy forces has been reported in 
several locations. 
  In the 1st Corps theater of operations, the fiercest attacks 
by the Serbian occupying forces was registered on the 
Olovo-Vares front. The enemy keeps retaliating for his losses 
in the clashes with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army by shelling 
civilian targets from a safe distance. The chetniks have been 
shelling Olovo and Vares with 120-mm and 82-mm mortars. From 
[words indistinct] the aggressor has been firing anti-aircraft 
machine guns and M-84 machine guns at the defense lines in 
Gradina and Gornji Kopaci. 
  After several days of preparations and after concentrating 
new forces and bringing in heavy artillery to Nisici Plateau and 
Olovske Luke, the chetniks this morning launched a fierce 
combined artillery and infantry attack on our defense lines. 
Despite hundreds of shells fired in only a few hours [words 
indistinct], our lines remain stable and firm, and impenetrable 
for the chetniks. Despite several warnings by UNPROFOR, the 
chetniks have again used artillery against civilian targets 
[words indistinct] within the 20-km zone around Sarajevo. 
  According to the latest information, there are daily 
conflicts on the Nisici plateau between the local military and 
the population, and forces that have arrived from other parts of 
the so-called republic of Srpska. In order to calm the 
situation in this area at least a little, and to prevent the 
increasingly open clashes between the [word indistinct] police 
-- who even use weapons to express their dissatisfaction with 
the [words indistinct] of the local Chetniks, which culminated 
in the killing of some 10 policemen [words indistinct] -- a 
military delegation of Karadzic's parastate creation arrived 
last night. 
  On the Visoko front the chetniks keep firing with M-84 
machine guns at the road Visoko-[word indistinct]. The chetniks 
are also using portable rocket launchers and 60-mm mortars to 
fire on our positions in [words indistinct]. 
  This is stated by the 1st Corps Information Service.

<F P=106> [By Pascal Barollier] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, May 18 (AFP) -- The United Nations will 
launch a campaign next week to raise the $530 million it 
estimates is needed to rebuild the war-torn Bosnian capital, 
according to a confidential report obtained by AFP Wednesday [18 
May]. The report said the fundraising operation would kick off 
in Vienna on May 24 and 25. The figure of $530 million was just 
set here after a year-long study by the Interim Coordination 
Board (ICBO), a body created last April under UN Resolution 908 
to determine Sarajevo's needs, handle the fundraising and 
attribute the reconstruction contracts to international firms. 
  The ICBO assessment was led by its chairmen, William 
Eagleton 
of the United States and Edouard Rousselot of France. Rousselot 
said their report estimated $270 million was needed to get 
emergency services in working order within six weeks, and 
another $260 million for what were called medium-term needs over 
the next two years. 
  It is to be officially presented to the special UN envoy on 
ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, in Zagreb on Friday, then go on 
to Vienna for the actual start of the campaign, he said. The 
report is divided into seven broad chapters: water, gas, 
electricity, city services, civil engineering, city planning and 
health and education, according to Rousselot. 
  City services covers public transport, telecommunications 
and 
garbage collection, while civil engineering includes airport 
management, railroads, bridges, highways and public buildings. 
  Rousselot said that reinstating water, gas and electricity 
services "will represent about 30 percent" of the $530 million. 
But he said the hardest task will be to persuade governments to 
commit themselves to investing in Sarajevo's reconstruction. 
  The ICBO functions like an American-type trust. It now has 
no funds at all and has operated up to now entirely off the UN 
budget in New York. Its chairmen will present their proposals 
to donor countries and institutions at the Vienna meeting next 
week. Contributors will then be called to New York in June to 
detail their offers to the ICBO, which in turn will open bidding 
on reconstruction contracts. Several international officials 
involved in the project have said the Vienna meeting will be the 
first "moment of truth" to gauge how willing states involved in 
the peace effort in Bosnia are to take part in the next stage, 
post-war reconstruction. 
  "A certain number of Moslem countries are not even asking 
questions and already have their money ready," said one of these 
officials who asked not to be named. But another raised doubts 
about French and British participation in rebuilding Sarajevo 
after more than two years of war, saying he feared a "return to 
the good old French way of saying 'everything will work out' 
while not putting any money on the table." 
  Rousselot said in talks between ICBO and Bosnian officials, 
the Bosnians have already questioned why France has shown no 
great interest in getting as involved in the trust project as it 
has been on the ground, where its forces form the largest 
contingent in the UN peackeeping force. 
  Recession-hit France has already spent three billion dollars 
-- nearly six times Sarajevo's estimated reconstruction cost -- 
for maintaining its troops in Bosnia and Croatia over the last 
two years of warfare, according to military sources here who 
requested anonymity.

  [Text] Upon returning from their visit to the Russian 
Federation, the members of the Serbian Civic Council [SKV] held 
a news conference, at which they informed reporters about the 
contacts that they had made with the representatives of the 
Russian Government and the Russian Patriarchy. During this 
visit, Russian Federation representative Churkin was informed 
about the views of the SKV that the Bosnian issue can be solved 
through political negotiations. The best evidence of that is 
the agreement signed in Washington, stressed Mirko Pejanovic, 
member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and SKV chairman. 
The Russian Federation is firmly committed to the sovereignty 
and the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its 
internationally recognized borders, and the unity of the city of 
Sarajevo, he said. 
  During their visit to the Russian Federation, the members of 
the SKV had meetings with the representatives of the Russian 
Orthodox Church, and informed them about the extent of 
destruction of the Bosniak religious shrines in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  An invitation was extended to Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin during their stay in Moscow to visit Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Kecman: "Preparations to Build Road from </F>
Banja Luka to Cadjavica Via Manjaca: Half a Million Marks for 
Initial Work"] 
  [Text]The Executive Committee of the SO [Serb 
Opstina] in Banja Luka has provided 500,000 German marks [DM] 
for the construction of a road which will shorten the trip to 
Knin by 60 km; the people of Manjaca enthusiastically welcomed 
around 300 engineers from the First Corps with 50 machines; 
petroleum, spare parts, and projects for shorter section 
provided. 
  Banja Luka, 28 Apr--The Executive Committee of Banja Luka 
Opstina, at the suggestion of chairman Rajko Kasagic, has 
decided to pay DM500,000 to the fund for construction of a 
highway between Banja Luka and Cadjavica from the opstina 
budget, as the initial amount necessary for 50 machines and 300 
soldiers from engineer units of the First Krajina Corps to carry 
out preparations and begin cutting the section from Kocic Han to 
Cadjavica, 15 km in length, over Easter. 
  "The Executive Committee has provided this money to secure 
spare parts for machines, tires, batteries, and other necessary 
goods, so that the start will be successful. An adequate 
quantity of petroleum has also been acquired. Responsible for 
the acquisition of the petroleum are `Sinekop,' owned by Slavko 
Roguljic, PP `Djukic,' owned by Momo Djukic, and MP 
`Poljoeksport' in Banja Luka. The road should be completed by 21 
September," read the announcement by Rajko Kasagic, who is also 
coordinator of the construction of this road, which will shorten 
the connection between Knin and Banja Luka by 60 km. 
  Engineer Radoslav Brdjanin, minister for urban planning and 
construction, and part of the ministry in Banja Luka are 
providing project documentation for a shorter variant (in 
addition to the longer one to be built); completion of the 
shorter route, across the military firing range at Dobrnja, 
would shorten the Banja Luka section by more than 5 km. 
  Engineers from the First Krajina Corps are already on site 
in 
Stricici, and the 300 soldiers are being provided for by hosts, 
including the president of the local community, Dragan Vulin, 
who says that the soldiers building the road will have 
everything they want because the people are finally getting the 
road promised to them back during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. 
  "By connecting the town, by building small properties and 
dwellings in Manjaca, and through work in Banja Luka, we have 
the opportunity to move the city to Zmijanje and Manjaca," says 
Petar Savarevic from Stricici. 
  Father Nikodin Cavic of Pervan feels that this road will 
bring the cultivated land of Manjaca to life, and with the 
industrious Krajinans it will become like the cultivated land of 
Sumadija. 
  "From the production of healthy food, unlimited 
possibilities 
for raising cattle and meat packing, a return to old trades in a 
modern way, to the production of furniture, naturally in small 
workshops--cottage industries, as `Simpo' in Vranje is 
doing--and then possibilities for three swathes of grass a year 
and raising sheep like before the war, with this road this 
region has the opportunity to revive and become a significant 
factor for development in the republic of Srpska, because 
together with Lijevce Polje and the food producers there, food 
from Manjaca is the mainstay of development," says Father Cavic. 
  Something that has not been done in the last 100 years, 
something about which Petar Kocic wrote, something that the 
authorities of the former SFRY and Bosnia-Herzegovina did not 
succeed in doing, something that neither Mamula nor Kadijevic 
succeeded in doing, but that they promised to do: It appears 
that this will now be corrected and that the Banja 
Luka-Cadjavica road (intersecting the Mrkonjic Grad-Kljuc road) 
will finally be built. It remains to be seen whether all this 
will be happen according to schedule, before the Nativity of the 
Virgin Mary, under the difficult conditions of sanctions and 
minimal production in an economy that has no market.

<F P=106> [Article by CTK and "(bor)": "The Collapse of East Europe </F>
Has Caused More Problems for the West, Says Zieleniec"] 
  [Text] Prague--The collapse of the communist bloc perhaps 
caused greater problems for Western Europe than for East Europe, 
said Czech Foreign Minister J. Zieleniec on 14 May in Prague in 
a speech delivered at an international conference called "Europe 
and Us." Zieleniec pointed out that, while the danger in the 
East had previously been the adhesive of West European 
integration, the European Union [EU] must now look painstakingly 
for a firm integrating vision. He described the influence of 
the crisis of the so-called social state, which put down roots 
in Western Europe, as a major problem for European integration. 
The effect of this crisis has been that more and more 
discussion is being devoted to quotas or subsidies than to the 
political substance of Europe. "We think more about what 
divides us than about what unites us," said the minister with 
regard to the EU and its operation. In an exchange of views 
with German Social Democratic Deputy Glotz, Zieleniec expressed 
the opinion that Czech-German relations are better than they 
were following the CSFR's breakup last January. Glotz, on the 
other hand, thinks that these relations are worse than they were 
two or three years ago. 
  The Czech Republic is now in many respects better prepared 
to 
enter the EU than the EU is to admit it, said Kurt Biedenkopf, 
prime minister of Saxony, at the conference. According to him, 
Germany will fully support the Czech Republic's entry into the 
Union, not only by voting for it but also by means of real 
cooperation and support for the Czech economy. 
  In the interest of creating a genuinely integrated Europe, 
the EU states must put an end to manifestations of rampant 
egoism, said Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek at the 
conference. "We do not have enough common European values. We 
lack a European spirit," he said in the debate. 
  The conference, held from 13 to 15 May, was attended by 
important European political figures.

  [Text] Temelin--The date for putting into operation the 
first block of the Temelin nuclear power station, originally 
scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year, will probably be 
postponed until mid-1996. In connection with the envisaged 
delay, the timetable for the work was on the agenda of 
yesterday's supervisory meeting held to discuss the Temelin 
nuclear power station project, which was attended by Minister 
Dlouhy. Engineer Petr Karas, chairman of the Czech Energy 
Enterprises board, told LIDOVE NOVINY that one of the reasons 
for postponing the date for bringing in the nuclear fuel is the 
change in the technology, and processing the documentation 
associated with it. "Of course, there are other reasons. For 
example, the government's talks on whether to say yes or no to 
Temelin lasted almost two years, which, naturally, had an 
influence on commencing certain activities," added Eng. Karas.

<F P=106> [Article by "(mfs)": "The State Guarantees Have Made It </F>
Possible To Obtain Better Credit"] 
  [Text] Prague--Of the overall budgeted costs, amounting to 
68.8 billion korunas [Kc], for the completion of the Temelin 
nuclear power plant [JETE], a total of Kc35.1 billion had been 
invested by the end of last year. 
  In this context, Miroslav Novak, director of communications 
at the Czech Energy Enterprises [CEZ] power company, which is 
the investor for the JETE project, told a CESKY DENIK reporter 
that the final budgeted costs, even with the implementation of 
the U.S. safety system from the Westinghouse company, should in 
no way exceed the sum of Kc70 billion. The Czech Government's 
state guarantees for the delivery of automatic control systems 
and nuclear fuel for the first two JETE blocks amount to Kc12.2 
billion. This involves, first and foremost, a loan from 
Citibank, with a guarantee from the U.S. EXIM bank and the 
Belgian ON'D. The state guarantees made it possible to obtain a 
longer-term dollar credit with a date of maturity of 14 years 
given the lower interest of up to 5 percent. The other costs, 
apart from the loan from Investicni banka [Investment Bank] 
amounting to Kc1.1 billion, which is already more than half 
exhausted, come from CEZ's own resources.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec "prepared </F>
by" Jan Bednar; place and date not given: "Our Recipe for 
Reform Is `Quicker and Simpler'"] 
  [Text] Following the recent elections in Hungary, the 
Czech Republic is the last country in the former Eastern bloc in 
which the left has not yet come to power. We asked Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec to assess the elections in Hungary: 
  [Zieleniec] The Hungarian elections and their course and 
results reflect the complexity of the changes taking place in 
Central and East Europe. I think that the consistency of 
government policy in the Czech Republic will stand out better 
against these elections and also against the elections in the 
other countries of Central Europe. Although we have a distinct 
"plotted" course, a direction in which our state's 
transformation should proceed, we are also pursuing a policy 
that will not lead to social tension and social crises. I think 
that it is terribly important that the outlook, which a state 
undergoing our country's kind of transformation has, is clear 
and credible to the voter. On the other hand, the chosen path 
must be viable. And there are things a responsible politician 
must know how to balance. He must know how to maintain 
credibility even under the conditions of complex political 
decisionmaking, which concerns not only the far-off vision but 
also the immediate future. Perhaps this sounds a little like 
praising our policy to the skies. But, believe me, during the 
whole of the period I have been in politics, our discussions 
have always concentrated on how to go straight after our vision 
of society and, at the same time, maintain the prospect of 
realizing this vision. This means, among other things, 
conducting the kind of policy that will not bring about an 
upsurge in left-wing forces, especially the extreme left wing. 
  [CESKY DENIK] The Hungarian elections, in which the 
socialists triumphed, will certainly mean a slowdown in the 
reforms in Hungary or, in any case, a shift from a more 
right-wing policy to a more left-wing one. We have already seen 
something like this in Poland and elsewhere to the east of our 
republic. Do you have the impression that we are now isolated? 
  [Zieleniec] I would not say that we are isolated. I would 
like to emphasize one thing: The vision is important for us, as 
I have said, and we must measure our path toward it by our 
potential. It is the same for the parties now in power in 
Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia--their vision is important to 
them, and they are choosing the means to achieve it. From the 
short-term point of view--that is, for this day, month, and 
year--the differences between the Polish, the Slovak, and the 
Hungarian, and also, to a certain extent, our policies, do not 
have to be of a fundamental nature. Political differences tend 
to crop up in the longer-term outlook. If we take economic 
development, differences will perhaps crop up in two or four 
years, not in a few months. 
  [CESKY DENIK] The differences between the states will not 
perhaps be of a fundamental nature, but our republic will 
obviously proceed faster in transformation than Poland or 
Hungary... 
  [Zieleniec] This is the situation regardless. The principle 
methodical approach for our reform was always the endeavor to 
proceed as fast and as simply as possible. Speed is important 
because the faster we leave the transformation stage, the faster 
we rid ourselves of its burdens. Otherwise, there is a danger 
that these burdens will turn into an avalanche that will crash 
down on reform. Simplicity is important from the point of view 
of social acceptance of reform. It is possible to think up all 
sorts of complex privatization procedures that, in certain 
theoretical considerations, may be a bit more convenient. On 
the other hand, however, the transparency and intelligibility, 
for example, of coupon privatization have made it politically 
acceptable to our voters, as opposed to the very complicated, 
often dubious privatization schemes being applied in other 
countries. From this point of view, the policy of "quickly and 
simply" is a recipe we stand by.

<F P=106> [Article by "(gag)": "An Elite Military Brigade Is Being </F>
Formed in the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague--Establishing the rapid deployment brigade 
is one of the Czech Army's priorities. This is one of the few 
development programs the military can undertake in view of the 
tight budget (27 billion korunas [Kc]). 
  It will cost Kc800 million to establish the rapid deployment 
force of 3,000 men (they will begin to fulfill their tasks on 1 
July). Colonel Karel Hejzek, of the General Staff, who has been 
entrusted with establishing the brigade, rejects the view that 
this ambitious project, like the grandiose but unprepared plans 
to professionalize the Federal Army, will also fail. He 
maintains, among other things, that by yesterday, when the 
recruitment centers closed, 600 reserve soldiers had signed up 
for the rapid deployment force. Nevertheless, he envisages 
that, after the medical examinations and psychological and 
physical tests, one-third of the men will be rejected. "We are 
not an institute for fallen aristocrats," says the colonel. "We 
do not intend to moderate the strict selection criteria, even if 
we have to begin training with less than the full complement of 
personnel in the units." Until now, two-thirds of the planned 
number of men have been serving in the brigade. However, if 
Col. Hejzek's group were to apply the standards governing the 
selection and training of the elite U.S. Army units, the public 
would probably accuse it of tyrannizing people. "I am 
disappointed by the physical prowess of the recruits that have 
joined up," admits the colonel. The Army would like to pay the 
professionals in the rapid deployment force well and also offer 
them language and specialist training. The one thing that 
worries the experts is the reaction of the soldiers recruited 
for further service to the standard of accommodation, which does 
not even reach the normal standard. There are also problems 
with apartments for the families of career soldiers. Because of 
this situation, very capable professionals are refusing to move 
to the elite brigade's garrisons.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Gian Franco </F>
Svidercoschi; place and date not given: "The Fall of Communism 
in the East: A Wasted Opportunity for Europe"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Svidercoschi] Mr. President, 
is the "logic of Yalta" really a thing of the past? Even the 
pope emphasized during his visit to the Baltic states that "the 
great peoples and the small peoples must enjoy the same respect 
for their rights." 
  [Walesa] Once the opposition between the two blocs, with 
their symbol, the Berlin Wall, had disappeared, the vision of a 
single Europe of free, democratic nations seemed just around the 
corner, a foregone conclusion. Sadly, reality has turned out to 
be just the opposite. Like the other Central and East European 
countries that have regained their freedom and sovereignty, 
Poland is experiencing difficulty in asserting its status as a 
partner on an equal footing. Our path toward European economic 
and security structures looks long and tortuous. European 
solidarity is lacking. We are running up against policies 
steeped in protectionism, particularly economic protectionism. 
It is difficult to get the West to realize that leaving our 
countries to their own devices may mean placing the whole of 
Europe in jeopardy. It may mean a relapse in the reforms. Nature 
abhors a vacuum, hence our campaign to widen the European 
security area, which in turn will only become possible with a 
gradual entry of the Central and East European countries into 
the European structures. 
  [Svidercoschi] Is there danger of a new bipolarity? 
  [Walesa] I have been saying for months that attempts to 
reestablish the old, bipolar order can now be seen. Indeed, 
what other conclusion can we draw, when others want to decide on 
our behalf, when Russia can lay down conditions to NATO? A 
situation in which the great impose their will on the small is 
unacceptable. The rights of all must be respected in the same 
way if we really want to talk about freedom and sovereignty. 
The highway code is the same for everyone, for large cars and 
small ones, but different standards are being applied here 
according to individual interests. How can we talk about 
equality in the face of so many examples of disparate treatment? 
Poland is experiencing this, too, and my admonition to the West 
is that it should beware of these shortsighted, selfish 
policies. I see that, despite a lot of fine words and 
declarations, there are still divisions in Europe, as if Europe 
lacked a vision, a concept of how to handle the great victory 
that the collapse of communism represented. 
  [Svidercoschi] Do you fear Russian expansionism? 
  [Walesa] The free, democratic Poland clearly defined its 
foreign policy priorities from the outset, adopting as its 
primary goal membership in the European economic and security 
structures. Russia is an extremely important neighbor of ours, 
and we attach great significance to bilateral relations, 
provided they are rooted in the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit. Economic cooperation with this enormous market is a 
must for us. I do not fear what you call Russian expansionism, 
despite the fact that Russia dictated conditions to us for many 
years. What is more, had this expansionism continued, it would 
not have stopped at a country like ours; it would have gone 
further. However, I believe that the policies of a democratic 
Russia will not be dominated by the imperialist designs of the 
past. It will find its rightful place among the other 
democratic countries, respecting the rules of the international 
community. We intend to develop every form of cooperation with 
a Russia of this type. This is essential for the common Europe. 
  [Svidercoschi] But it would appear that Western Europe has 
not yet realized the urgency of seizing the present historical 
and political moment. 
  [Walesa] As I have already said, my warning to Europe is not 
to let this moment slip through its fingers. History will judge 
us on this basis. We have never yet had such a chance to build 
a single free, democratic Europe, the Europe of the "little 
homelands," the Europe that, in its unity, will nevertheless 
allow each state and nation to preserve its own identity, the 
Europe where no one lays down the law for others, where the 
rules of the game are clear, accepted by all of the players and 
obeyed to the last. 
  [Svidercoschi] You once said that the former communists won 
in Poland not on the strength of the old ideology but because 
they were more active and better skilled in the wielding of 
power. Do you still think so? 
  [Walesa] I confirm what I said when I predicted this trend. 
I would add that the victory of the postcommunists is also due 
to the fact that our societies have had to bear the weight of 
reforms, which many people find hard to stand. The free market 
and capitalism have brought a lot of serious problems: 
unemployment, uncertainty about the future, and fewer social 
safety nets. Not everyone can become a capitalist overnight. 
Pockets of poverty have sprung up alongside the rapid rises to 
fortune. Many people see the closure of their unproductive 
factories, when economic figures supplanted ideology as the 
criterion, as unfair. Once upon a time, we all had equal shares 
of the poverty, but things have changed now. The rules of the 
market economy are paramount. 
  [Svidercoschi] Have mistakes been made? 
  [Walesa] In our inexperience, we, too, made mistakes when 
we came to power. In any case, the transformations in the 
system were quite unprecedented. Perhaps we wanted to make up 
for the lost years too fast, sometimes losing sight of the 
individual, his anxieties, his fear of the unknown. Anyway, you 
cannot change people's mindset overnight, and it is in this 
mindset that communism has its stronghold. It takes years for 
people to realize the extent to which the future depends on 
their own capacity for action, for running things, so the 
reaction of people who are disappointed and look back with 
longing at their former security, regardless of the poverty, 
comes as no surprise. But they will have to get it into their 
heads that you never jump into the same river twice, and there 
is no going back. This is already evident in Poland, as the 
recent wave of strikes has shown. Our chances lie in reforms. I 
know they are difficult, but we have to pay this price. We have 
to do everything to ensure that the price remains as low as 
possible, particularly for the weaker layers of society. 
  [Svidercoschi] Can Solidarity have exhausted its entire 
potential in terms of ideals? 
  [Walesa] Solidarity, which came into being in 1980, has 
ensured a place for itself in history. It was a social movement 
that enjoyed an incredible strength and role in Poland and 
Europe. But the time for fighting is different from peacetime. 
It poses different challenges. Solidarity continues to seek 
its identity, whether to take on the role of a political force 
or to remain a union defending the interests of the grass roots, 
which are now made up mainly of workers in the major factories. 
Solidarity has encountered great difficulty in resolving this 
dilemma over recent years. As a movement that contributed to 
the collapse of the communist system and launched the process of 
economic, political, and social reforms, it has often found 
itself at a crossroads: Should it act as a protective umbrella 
for the various governments that have emanated from it or as an 
opposition in the event of government policy diverging from the 
interests of the union grass roots? 
  [Svidercoschi] And what has it decided? 
  [Walesa] The turning point came with the Solidarity campaign 
that culminated in the fall of the government led by Hanna 
Suchocka and cleared the way for the postcommunists. Solidarity 
is now increasingly opting for a union role, but I believe that 
the country's sense of responsibility and the overriding 
national interest will prevail over the particularisms of the 
union and its leaders. I believe that Solidarity will not 
discount what it has fought for, and it will remain moderate and 
circumspect in its demands. 
  [Svidercoschi] Mr. President, you will be attending the 
commemorations at Monte Cassino [Italian World War II 
battlefield]. What significance does that 50-year-old page in 
history have today? 
  [Walesa] For many Polish soldier-exiles, the journey to 
their 
homeland, from which they had been forcibly uprooted, ended at 
Monte Cassino. Before reaching it, they had crossed half the 
world, surviving the concentration camps and prisons of the 
"inhuman land." However, their dream of a return to Poland faded 
in Italy. All they had left was a last wish engraved in stone: 
"Passerby, tell Poland we fell in its loyal service." Poland 
has not forgotten, even though there have been those who have 
tried to wipe out the memory. 
  [Svidercoschi] There were the communists in Poland... 
  [Walesa] Many of those who decided to return were 
persecuted, 
humiliated by the new power imposed on the Poles. General 
Anders, who had led them back to Poland, was stripped of his 
citizenship. But people's memories and hearts do not change by 
decree. The spirit of a nation cannot be imprisoned, nor can 
its freedom be taken away. 
  [Svidercoschi] They had fought for the freedom of Poland and 
Europe. 
  [Walesa] Although the battle of Monte Cassino did not change 
the course of our history, the sacrifice was not made in vain. 
It was part of Poland's contribution to the victory of 
democracy and freedom over Nazi barbarism. It was a 
contribution to the rebuilding of a free, democratic Europe. 
Sadly, there was no place for us in this Europe. But, had it 
not been for that battle, we would have found it much more 
difficult many years later to transform the dream of a free 
Poland into reality. We always remember it, and it is our wish 
that Europe remember it, too. Our wish is that no one should 
ask whether we are entitled to a place in the community of free, 
democratic European countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Herbert Hupka, chairman of the Silesian </F>
Expellees Union and president of the East German Culture Council 
Foundation, by correspondent Anna Fastnacht-Stupnicka; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Was the East German Culture 
Council Foundation, of which you are president, established by 
members of the Expellees Union? 
  [Hupka] Its first president was a native Pomeranian, the 
second was a Sudeten German, and I, the third, am a Silesian. 
The foundation is governed by Article 96 of the Expellees 
Union, which states that the expellees' cultural heritage should 
be documented, cultivated, and kept alive in an ongoing process. 
It is often said that the year 1945 was "year zero" for the 
Germans, that some new process began at that time. I do not 
hold that view. The expellees carried with them invisible 
baggage of their own culture. It is our task to keep that 
culture alive. We are not interested in preserving it in 
museums, and we do not deal exclusively with the past. Among 
other things, the foundation organizes competitions for the best 
short stories and academic dissertations that deal with the 
present time and look into the future. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Apart from organizing lectures on the 
architectural heritage in Poland, do you also envisage helping 
financially to restore cultural heritage sites? 
  [Hupka] Of course, money is needed if we are to save such 
places as, for instance, Lubiaz Castle from falling into ruin. 
But first and foremost we are concerned about making everyone 
aware of the importance of this cultural heritage site and 
informing the public about its present condition. We could 
mobilize financial assistance through well-planned joint action. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Many such sites in Poland suffered 
neglect in the past decades, but we must not forget that the 
most extensive damage to material and intellectual cultural 
goods was done by and during the war. Is the concern that 
Germans show over these goods now an attempt at atonement? 
  [Hupka] Perhaps we should formulate this problem 
differently. For us, the originating force behind our action is 
the Polish-German good-neighbor treaty, which, among other 
things, obliges Poles and Germans to assume joint responsibility 
for goods representing cultural heritage. Jan Jozef Lipski was 
aware of this obligation when he wrote: "The principal duty is 
to prevent deterioration and destruction of material objects of 
cultural heritage. To tolerate and allow their deterioration, 
to undervalue their cultural significance only because they do 
not belong to `our' culture, or to attempt to `erase' their 
German origin is to show Polish patriotism in a very unfavorable 
light." So our concern for these goods is not some kind of 
atonement on our part, as you suggested, but attests to our 
determination to put into practice the provisions of the 
Polish-German treaty. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Before the treaty was signed, the 
Expellees Union protested against it very strongly. Have you by 
now accepted its provisions on good-neighborly relations and 
inviolability of the existing borders? 
  [Hupka] Once a treaty is signed by both sides, it must be 
respected. It must be acknowledged, recognized, and accepted. 
We are all opposed to the sort of thing that is currently 
happening in Yugoslavia and to the ethnic cleansing taking place 
there. In the same way, I am opposed to the idea of expelling 
people from their homeland. Let me recall here the words 
spoken by Vaclav Havel, who said that the expulsion of the 
Germans was not an act of squaring accounts for the wrongs 
suffered but one of revenge. It is my wish to see Poles and 
Germans jointly condemn the expulsion of the Germans as a 
criminal act. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] But was not the war that led to it 
the ultimate crime? 
  [Hupka] Of course, the war was a crime perpetrated against 
us all by Hitler and Stalin. Nevertheless, you must remember 
that the invasion of France and Belgium was a crime, too, yet no 
one was expelled from those territories. One crime should not 
generate another. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Do the expellees want to return here? 
  [Hupka] The right to one's homeland and to 
self-determination is a recognized right and, as such, should be 
respected. Once Poland has become a member of the European 
Union, everyone will be able to decide where they want to 
settle. The problem will automatically cease to exist. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Is this why Germans are so eager to 
see Poland join the European Union? 
  [Hupka] We are all Europeans. We cannot place Poles lower 
than the Danes, or any other nation. Everyone in Europe should 
belong to the Union, and there are no hidden agendas in what I 
am saying. However, some people in Germany, just as in Poland, 
are opposed to the idea of "accelerated" integration. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] People in Poland associate your name 
unequivocally with revisionism. However, for some time now your 
utterances have seemed to acquire a more conciliatory tone. 
Does this mean that you are changing your views? 
  [Hupka] We have never been advocates of revanchism. I have 
not changed, nor have I ever expressed anti-Polish sentiments. 
It was just that my views were presented and interpreted by 
others in that way for the past 40 years. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] How do you like what you see in Polish 
Silesia nowadays? Have you noted any changes for the better in 
recent years? 
  [Hupka] This is my fifth visit here since 1990. Of course, 
many things have changed for the better. But I should say that 
things are still not changing fast enough. It could be that 
this assessment is colored by my temperament. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] What do you think of the recent 
incident provoked by skinheads in Dziewkowice or the disruption 
of the celebrations commemorating the 3 May Constitution and the 
Silesian uprisings, which happened recently at St. Anna's Mount? 
  [Hupka] We are, of course, very critical of these incidents. 
We call such phenomena nationalism and chauvinism, but we do not 
generalize their occurrence and claim that they represent a 
specifically Polish trait. Those people are simply extremists. 
We are equally opposed to similar things happening in Germany 
now, such as attacks against the Turks, and we would not like 
these phenomena to be generalized and held against all Germans, 
either. We want to bring down barriers, not erect new ones. 
  [Fastnacht-Stupnicka] Thank you for talking with us.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Roman Harmoza, head of the Cadres </F>
Department in the Ministry of National Defense, by Tadeusz 
Mitek; place and date not given: "The First Principle Is 
Justice"] 
  [Excerpts] [Mitek] General, during one of your press 
conferences not long ago, you spoke about a new cadre policy for 
the Defense Ministry. This is a very broad and general term. 
Let us, then, explain right at the beginning our cadre policy 
and its inherent novelty. 
  [Harmoza] We should, perhaps, replace the word "policy," 
which, indeed, is very voluminous, with the word "strategy," 
which means preparation for something we may face. It is 
necessary to take a look at the cadre issue from such a long 
perspective because the entire political system of the state and 
of the Armed Forces is being transformed. Therefore, we must 
think about what kind of soldiers we will need, with what 
professions and personalities, so that they will be able to find 
their niches in the European security structures we are 
entering. Thus, one of the goals of our activities is to 
prepare a new model of the professional soldier. We are doing 
this starting with the military education system. 
  [Mitek] More specifically, what concrete cadre activities 
make up this novelty you have mentioned? 
  [Harmoza] We have introduced establishments and rules 
typical of an army in a democratic state, such as the apolitical 
character of the Army, ensuring freedom of religion and 
religious practices, granting the right for a soldier to 
resign--that is, the right of terminating the service 
relationship. We have created the possibility for appealing 
many personnel decisions related to the rights of the soldier, 
including decisions on dismissal from the professional military 
service. We have introduced a system of contract service and 
inactive state. These are all modern solutions that correspond 
to those that exist in the armies of Western countries. 
  [Mitek] However, is what we are discussing now not an 
abstract idea? Activities relating to cadre issues must be 
correlated with the entire structure of the Armed Forces, with 
the concept of restructurization, and with legislature 
concerning the defense system. All this is still in the stage 
of creation. How certain can we be, then, that the solutions 
that have been accepted are correct? Do we know where we are 
heading? 
  [Harmoza] You need not worry about that. The ministry, the 
General Staff, and the Polish Army know how the final structure 
of the Armed Forces should look. We are now going through the 
stage of discussions concerning how it should be reached. There 
is no use in concealing the fact that money is behind all of the 
problems that are arising. This is a costly operation. Even 
the operation of decreasing the number of professional soldiers 
is expensive because people do not just disappear--they still 
receive money from the state budget as reservists. Even the 
rich country of Germany has recently been experiencing the same 
problems, which only proves the scale of these difficulties. 
There is also the question of how to implement reform, the 
goals of which we know, and keep costs low, and also how to do 
this in such a way as to not be unfair to people. 
  [Mitek] That is correct. This feeling of injustice and 
concern is not uncommon among the cadres. There are also still 
doubts concerning the criteria of cadres activities. They were 
often interpreted as varying with the situation, dependent upon 
the configuration of power, calculated to meet the temporary 
interest of the ministry. Our daily receives many letters that 
suggest that it is still not certain whether the person who 
serves honestly and satisfies all of the criteria required will 
achieve the goals he has placed before himself in the service. 
Another restructurization idea or a new personnel configuration 
in the ministry will not stand in his way. 
  [Harmoza] I agree with you that there are such concerns 
among the cadres; I have recently visited many units, and I can 
confirm this. I want to say that one of our chief goals is to 
calm such moods. No one in the Ministry of National Defense is 
going to change the criteria that were in effect when a given 
professional soldier came into the Army. He concluded an 
agreement with the Army, and it is our duty to stick to it. The 
Army ensures every professional soldier the opportunity of 
working long enough to be entitled to a retirement pension. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Mitek] General, you have announced that you will make the 
Army younger. This statement has raised various fears, among 
others, because some are afraid that pretexts will be sought to 
make the Army younger. I will ask you bluntly: Are we going to 
witness dismissals among the cadre? 
  [Harmoza] I want to stress, as I have already done, that we 
will not seek any pretexts or methods to dismiss someone because 
he is nearing some age limit. However, there must be an 
awareness that rules will be applied rigorously--for example, 
the obligatory age limit for cadre dismissals, which is 
envisioned in the pertinent law. Everyone knows this 
regulation, and no one should be surprised that he ought to go. 
  At the same time, conditions must be created for individuals 
who want to leave earlier to be able to do so, after obtaining 
certain rights, and to arrange their lives anew. 
  I will stress once again that there will be no restrictions 
in the form of earlier dismissals. The rejuvenation of the Army 
will be a complex process, scheduled to take place over at least 
eight to 12 years. [passage omitted] 
  [Mitek] I think, General, that our readers would be 
resentful if I did not ask you whether there are any guarantees 
that there will no longer be the principle of promotion in line 
with the popular rule called PMF--passive, mediocre, but 
faithful. Is it really a thing of the past? 
  [Harmoza] The popularity of what you have just mentioned 
concerns the realm of jokes rather than reality. There was a 
time when such jokes were given publicity--perhaps for some 
deeper purpose... 
  [Mitek] Just as about every sphere of reality--however, 
there is no smoke without fire. What I was referring to were 
guarantees of objectivity in the promotion criteria, optimal 
selection for posts. 
  [Harmoza] As I have said, we have rejected the ideological 
criteria for evaluation. We will take into account universal 
criteria pertaining to professional expertise, to the morale of 
an officer. They are concrete and verifiable, and not much can 
be faked or concealed here. This provides the guarantee, or at 
least a considerable probability, that those who are indeed the 
best in the military will be promoted. 
  [Mitek] The entire Army would also like to have one more 
guarantee--independence of the decisions, trends, or the cadre 
policy in the Defense Ministry of the politics spelled with a 
capital P, of personal configurations in the upper structures of 
authorities, and of the subjectivity of these authorities. 
  [Harmoza] It is obvious that we are exerting efforts to make 
the cadre practice in the ministry apolitical. I believe, 
however, that certain rules of activities and behavior are 
already obvious. They will also be forced by our participation 
in Western military structures, where certain standards have 
been set. This does not mean that we must learn or imitate 
everything in the cadre work. Our Western partners consider many 
of our solutions to be model solutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "RYCH": "Private Sector Is the Winner; Poland </F>
in the Period of Transformations"] 
  [Text] The Polish economy is in a transitional 
period, which by its very nature makes assessments of phenomena 
occurring in the economy difficult. Depending on the viewpoint, 
the same indicators may be interpreted in a number of different 
ways. An unclear picture emerges as a result of positive 
phenomena intertwining with negative ones, say the authors of a 
report entitled "The Polish Economy in the Period of 
Transformations in 1993," which was prepared by the Development 
and Strategic Studies Institute. 
  Among the unquestioned positive phenomena, one should list 
an 
increase in the GDP, the increasing profitability of 
enterprises, growing labor productivity, and a halting of the 
process of declining employment levels. Among the negative 
phenomena, one must mention inflation, which remains too high, a 
foreign trade deficit, and a crisis in public finances. 
  In discussing the report, Professor Marek Lubinski said that 
growth in individual consumption is the main source of economic 
revival. Last year, the indicator was 7 percent, with a 
3.6-percent growth in income. This happened at the cost of a 
decreased willingness to save and as a result of using 
consumption credits (the society's debt level is on the 
increase). Undocumented income from the "gray area" has also 
definitely influenced the market. On the other hand, however, 
one must consider the fact that Polish society's consumption is 
overvalued. About $2.5 billion worth of merchandise per year 
leaves our country primarily in the suitcases of visitors from 
Germany, and recently from the CIS as well. 
  Among the positive phenomena, one should list a change in 
the 
structure of the economy, which is reflected in the economic 
indicators. The private sector has been playing an ever-growing 
role in the economy. The sector demonstrates a higher level of 
investment activity and increases the employment level, and its 
contribution to the GDP has been growing. As Jerzy Kropiwnicki 
has noted, this happens, among other reasons, because of the 
process of a shrinking public sector. But there is no doubt 
that private entrepreneurs are not wasting opportunities that 
arise in this way. 
  Investments in real terms did not decline in 1993, but what 
did happen was a certain shift in these investments. The 
biggest increase was reported in the telecommunications 
industry, trade, and the wood and paper industry, while the 
smallest increase was reported in the metallurgic and 
electromachine industries. Expenditures on machinery and 
equipment have been clearly rising, while expenditures on 
industrial buildings have been declining. This trend is a 
reflection of a leaning toward modernizing machinery and 
equipment. 
  Unfortunately, the crisis in public finances has been 
holding 
steady. True, in 1993, attempts to halt a decline in budget 
revenues were successful, but the contribution by so-called 
rigid expenditures (financing the budget sector, subsidizing 
social insurance, servicing the public debt) has been rising. 
This makes it impossible to make rational choices in the 
process of managing public finances. 
  Throughout 1993, the rate of increase in unemployment was 
declining. In previous years, the rate of increase was 
associated with reductions in employment, whereas, in 1993, it 
was associated mainly with an increased labor supply, which 
enterprises found impossible to absorb. In this regard, the 
situation in agriculture continues to be very difficult; 
concealed unemployment has been gradually rising there. 
  The report's authors are of the view that there is untapped 
production potential in the Polish economy, despite a very clear 
improvement in how fixed assets are utilized.

<F P=106> [Article by "kob," "wk": "Barrier to Privatization"] </F>
  [Text] Every third person polled in an April survey 
conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] thinks 
that, six months into left-wing rule, privatization is 
continuing at too slow a pace. 
  When Pawlak's government was being formed, over one-third of 
respondents were afraid that the rate of privatization might be 
slowed down. Currently, almost 70 percent think the government 
has neither speeded up privatization nor slowed it down. 
  Let us recall that, over the first quarter of this year, 
only 
three enterprises were subjected to capital privatization (the 
smallest number since 1990.) Between the beginning of 1990 and 
September of last year, 76 companies were sold through capital 
privatization. The biggest number (23) changed owners in the 
first half of 1993. 
  Twelve percent of the CBOS respondents think that the 
government's lack of interest is the main obstacle in the 
privatization process. 
  A definitely larger number of respondents think that 
politics 
is not the main reason behind reducing the rate of 
transformations. According to those people, privatization is 
being slowed down first of all by lack of Polish capital (47 
percent), poor legislation (44 percent), and the bad economic 
situation of enterprises (41 percent). 
  Those who think privatization is beneficial for the economy 
come primarily from the managerial cadre and intelligentsia. 
They also reside in large cities, have higher education, are 
well-off financially, and sympathize with right-wing political 
parties. 
  Every fifth respondent is convinced of the harmful effects 
of 
privatization on the economy. This view is predominant among 
farmers, the poorest members of society, and those holding 
left-wing views. 
  A significant proportion of respondents remain afraid of the 
effects of privatization on the company where they work. 
  For almost half of all employees of state-owned enterprises 
who were polled, privatization brings along more fears than 
hopes for a better future. They are afraid that privatization 
will mean the end to guaranteed employment and that the level of 
social benefits will deteriorate. Respondents who view as 
positive the effects of transformations on the company where 
they work say that labor discipline and labor efficiency will 
increase. 
  "The poll's results may mean an increase in social support 
for a continuation of policies of Solidarity-derived 
governments. Respondents are beginning to reconcile themselves 
with the notion that the election programs of the Democratic 
Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party were just part of the 
election game," write CBOS commentators in their concluding 
remarks. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The poll, entitled "Society's Position on Privatization 
After 
the First Six Months of Left-Wing Rule," was conducted between 
14 and 18 April on a sample of 1,207 adult Poles.

<F P=106> [Article by "K.P.": "KERM Adopted a Program of Cooperation </F>
With the East; Fifty Percent of Export Growth by 1997"] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers' Economic Committee 
[KERM] has prepared a time schedule for measures that are 
necessary for an increase in Polish exports. Speeding up the 
rate of trade with the East is regarded as especially 
important. 
  KERM adopted a program entitled "Principles of Economic 
Cooperation Policies With Countries of the East and East Asia," 
which is an integral part of "Programs Supporting Eastern 
Policies," which is being recommended to the Council of 
Ministers. 
  In recent years, our trade exchange with countries of the 
former USSR and some countries of the East has suffered a 
substantial decline. 
  According to the principles adopted by KERM, at least a 
partial reconstruction of our economic relations with the East 
is to become an important element of Poland's trade policies 
(this applies also to the fast-growing countries of the Pacific 
region and China). As Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko 
said, Polish exports in that direction should be increasing at a 
clearly faster rate than exports to the remaining countries of 
the world. The deputy prime minister insists that we should 
continue trading despite the fact that sometimes transactions 
are dangerous and that there are problems with payments, while 
barter constitutes a significant portion (35 percent) of the 
exchange. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko's assumption is that Poland's 
economic growth will be occurring through increased exports. He 
said he believes that growth will continue at a level of 
approximately 4.5 percent. But, for exports to be "the motor" 
of general economic growth, the rate of development of exports 
must exceed by half the rate of development of the economy in 
general. The structure of our exports should be changed toward 
greater participation of investment goods. A negative balance 
of payments in merchandise and monetary exchange (which is in 
the range of $700 to $800 million) is also a disadvantageous 
phenomenon. Kolodko expects trade exchange with that region of 
the world to reach the amount of $7.6 to $7.8 billion by 1997 
(as compared with approximately $5 billion currently, which is 
40 percent of the amount from 1990). 
  In the assessment of KERM, direct reserves of increases in 
exports eastward have already been exhausted. It was announced 
that a review of procedures applied in returning taxes (VAT 
[value-added tax], customs duties, investment breaks) associated 
with financing cooperation with that region shall be implemented 
over the next five weeks. Interest rates on credits in 
investment exports shall be subsidized. Principles of payment 
with Eastern partners will also be put in order. Systemwide 
protection of the exchange is being prepared (setting in motion 
guarantees provided by the Corporation for Export Credit 
Insurance). A fund for state-provided guarantees in this kind 
of trade is said to reach the amount of $1.1 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by "E.W.": "Trilateral Commission Debates Energy </F>
Industry and Budget Sector--A Meeting Without Decisions"] 
  [Text] After more than five hours of debate, 
representatives of trade unions, employers, and the government 
failed to come to common decisions regarding prices of energy 
carriers and the level of salaries in the budget sector. The 
commission will return to the problem of the budget sector 
before the end of the week, while specific decisions regarding 
prices of energy carriers are to be made on 6 June, which is 
when the Main Statistical Office, the Central Planning 
Administration, and trade unions will present materials 
regarding the proportion of Polish families' budgets spent on 
energy expenditures. 
  An increase in prices of energy carriers is a life-or-death 
issue for the energy industry, Deputy Finance Minister Waldemar 
Manugiewicz stated after the debate was over. He reported that, 
in line with government plans, the level of economically 
justified prices shall be reached in the energy industry in the 
year 2000. Before that date, however, investments necessary for 
modernizing the branch will total approximately 3,000,000 
billion zlotys [Z]. The trade unionists reminded participants 
in the meeting that over 40 percent of Polish families spend 
between 12 and 18 percent of their incomes on energy, while, in 
families whose incomes do not exceed Z1.2 million [per month], 
the amount reaches 20 percent. Solidarity is of the view that 
official regulation of energy prices has an inflationary effect: 
Enterprises are aware of planned increases in advance, and they 
decide to increase prices on their products beforehand. The 
trade union suggested that energy prices be frozen for a year 
against inflation. 
  The government's proposal of a law regarding the regulation 
of salaries in the budget sector raised reservations of the 
trade unions and employers. According to the document, the 
Council of Ministers is supposed to present to the Trilateral 
Commission proposals for percentage-based remunerations in the 
budget sector for a following year,. The commission would then 
have a month in which to arrive at a joint position. If no 
agreement were to be reached within 30 days, the government 
would take into account the amounts in line with its proposals 
in the budget for the following year. The government also 
presented a proposal for regulating the powers of the Trilateral 
Commission. As A. Baczkowski informed, the principle of 
consensus is supposed to be the main principle of decisions. If 
the parties do not reach an agreement, the position worked out 
by them would only be of an opinion value for the Council of 
Ministers and the parliament; it would not influence the shape 
of the final decisions, Baczkowski explained. We do not agree 
with the proposition because we think the government may come up 
with a low level of salaries, Solidarity argued. The All-Poland 
Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] also opposed the proposal by 
saying that the issue of salaries in the budget sector cannot be 
a reason for problems that occur every year. According to the 
OPZZ, the only acceptable solution would be to design minimum 
financial guarantees for the budget sector.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov to the National </F>
Assembly in Sofia; monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] To implement this cabinet's 
intentions until the end of the year, I propose the following 
structural changes to the cabinet: 
  First, in addition to the existing post of one deputy prime 
minister who coordinates the solving of comprehensive tasks, I 
propose to appoint another deputy prime minister, who will not 
be responsible for a specific ministry. He will coordinate the 
implementation of the structural reform in our economy and will 
facilitate the implementation of the general policy aimed at 
finally halting the production decline in industry, agriculture, 
forestry, construction, and transportation, under conditions of 
protecting the environment. He will also be in charge of 
monitoring the utilization of loans received for the purpose of 
investment, and the use of the resources of the Reconstruction 
and Development Fund. 
  Second, I propose to appoint a deputy prime minister to 
control the country's financial situation, money circulation, 
and the implementation of deals and agreements. He will also 
monitor prices in the country and the foreign exchange market, 
in cooperation with the National Bank. In addition, he will 
control trade activity and help to create conditions for 
attracting foreign investment. He will also develop the 
government's relations with private business organizations. 
  Third, I propose to adopt an approach of gradually 
eliminating the committees which have not been envisaged by the 
Constitution, except for special cases, when the committees are 
created by a special law. Therefore, at this stage I propose to 
form two new ministries -- a Ministry of Power Supply and a 
Ministry of Communications -- on the basis of the payroll and 
budget of the corresponding existing committees. Three other 
committees will be reorganized without transforming them into 
separate ministries. 
  In the final analysis, as a result of all these measures the 
Council of Ministers will include 19 members. It will encompass 
17 ministries, one of which will be led by a deputy prime 
minister, plus a deputy prime minister without portfolio and the 
prime minister, making 19 members in all. Until now the cabinet 
has had 16 members. 
  Four agencies, instead of the existing three, will function 
at the Council of Ministers, and three committees instead of the 
existing eight. 
  The government will review also the activity of the Agency 
on 
Foreign Aid and the Committee on Bulgarians Living Abroad, with 
a view to improving their work. 
  Within the framework of these structural changes, I propose 
the following personnel changes in the cabinet: 
  First, to release Valentin Stefanov Karabashev from the 
posts 
of deputy prime minister and minister of trade. 
  Second, to release the minister of justice, Petur Zakhariev 
Kornazhev. 
  Third, to appoint Docent Rumen Vasilev Gechev as deputy 
prime 
minister without any specific ministry under him, in accordance 
with the first item of these structural changes. 
  Fourth, to appoint Kiril Petrov Tsochev as deputy prime 
minister and minister of trade, in accordance with the second 
item of the structural changes. 
  Fifth, to appoint Nikita Georgiev Shervashidze as minister 
of 
power supply. 
  Sixth, to appoint Gospodin Atanasov Atanasov as minister of 
justice. 
  Seventh, to appoint Krustyu Ivanov Mirski as minister of 
communications. 
  I propose that the National Assembly approves these changes 
to the cabinet. Ladies and gentlemen, you may approve or reject 
the specific program proposed by the cabinet for the period 
until the end of the year. The approval of this program must be 
supported next week by an agreement between the cabinet and the 
parliamentary factions or individual deputies that support it. 
This will be a sign that this cabinet is supported by a solid 
parliamentary majority, without which it cannot function 
successfully. Thus, the cabinet will not be a hostage to any 
parliamentary faction. 
  The failure to approve this submission will cause the 
resignation of the cabinet, the failure of the reform, the 
nonimplementation of the mass privatization, and serious 
disruption of the country's economic development. In practice, 
this will mean assuming an orientation toward early 
parliamentary elections. 
  I have done everything possible to find the best solution 
for 
the country. I and my team have served Bulgaria to the best of 
our abilities. We will continue to serve so in the future if 
the parliament so wishes. Thank you for your attention.

  [Excerpts] There will be a change of personnel in the 
leadership of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] after the 
second round because there is a need for new faces in the party. 
This will be decided at the party's national convention, Peter 
Boross has said at an MDF press briefing. Levente Sukosd 
reports: 
  [Sukosd] There will be no hidden or destroyed papers in the 
ministries and government offices. The registered [iktatott] 
files are stored and safeguarded and thus will be accessible to 
the next government, Prime Minister Peter Boross said. [passage 
omitted] 
  One of the mistakes of the existing government, for example, 
was its excessively strict implementation of the bankruptcy law, 
the prime minister said, adding: One should not just charge 
headlong at the economy. [passage omitted] 
  The expectations of the electorate are impossible to fulfill 
and this will become clear in the near future. All that has 
happened was inevitable -- people have been disappointed in 
their illusions and now they have new illusions, Prime Minister 
Peter Boross said. I am not interested in a position, he said, 
but he added that he is willing to continue work within the 
party.

  [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] 
welcomes the recent decision of the Western European Union [WEU] 
Council of Ministers to grant Romania the status of WEU 
associate partner -- a faxed communique signed by PDSR Executive 
President Adrian Nastase states today. The communique points 
out that, thanks to this decision, the Romanian Government has 
taken yet another step along the road to the country's 
integration into European structures. 
  Romania's admission to the WEU's political and military 
structures, the communique reads, proves that Western Europe has 
adopted a nondiscriminatory approach and is promoting a 
significant opening toward the countries in this part of the 
continent. 
  In conclusion, the PDSR wants to reiterate once more that 
Romania's full integration into European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures is a priority goal and that not only Romania's 
security but also the success of the transition process toward 
the social market economy, the establishment of the rule of law, 
and the country's socioeconomic progress depend on achieving 
this goal.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu by </F>
Cristina Trepcea in Strasbourg on 11 May: "Romania at the 
Council of Europe"] 
  [Text] The ceremony to sign Protocol 11 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms took place 
in Strasbourg on 11 May during the session of the Committee of 
Ministers of the Council of Europe. This is a key document of 
the Convention, which, among other things, stipulates the rights 
of citizens to turn directly to the Court for Human Rights -- 
obviously, only after all rights to appeal in the national legal 
courts have been exhausted. The court in Strasbourg has the 
right to cancel their decisions. On behalf of Romania the 
document was signed by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. 
Immediately after signing the document, the minister gave the 
following interview to the daily ADEVARUL: 
  [Trepcea] Minister Melescanu, what does the signing of this 
protocol mean for Romania? 
  [Melescanu] The signing of Protocol 11 for us fortunately 
coincides with the ratification by the Romanian Parliament of 
the European Convention on Human Rights. The signing of the 
protocol completes an effort that started on the day when 
Romania was admitted to the Council of Europe, an effort aimed 
at connecting Romania to a system not only of international 
standards on the issue of human rights, but also of verification 
of the way in which these standards are being observed. For us, 
there will be certain advantages in starting to apply the 
convention -- after a very short period of adaptation -- to the 
new system with a single and permanent European Court and with a 
much simpler mechanism to solve all cases that refer to Romania. 
It will also be a very interesting challenge because, as the 
rule demands it, first of all, one should exhaust all means of 
internal appeal and thus, we, as citizens, will have to resist 
the temptation to bring every difficulty or problem to 
Strasbourg. I hope that once this system comes into effect, we 
will receive the necessary assistance in order to make known all 
the advantages for us and beneficial conditions of this system. 
For us, this is an extremely important step on the road of 
connecting Romania to the European democratic standards. 
  [Trepcea] Protocol 11 is considered to be the most important 
protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights and it is a 
complex instrument that controls the respect of individuals' 
rights. How will this instrument function in Romania and when do 
you believe that it will be ratified? 
  [Melescanu] As a first stage, I would like us still to be 
able to use the old system in two stages. If the government 
accepts it, in the near future we will try to adapt to the 
requirements of the convention, from the viewpoint of the 
internal legislation as quickly as possible. Then, I believe 
that it will be two years before Protocol 11 comes into effect. 
My recommendation would be that, in this first period, we 
should make preparations so that we can be among the first 
countries that will ratify the protocol. There is no point in 
making a gratuitous gesture, such as ratifying it before it 
comes into effect. Let us concentrate on the fastest possible 
integration of the current system and of the Romanian 
legislation in the provisions of the convention, as it is today. 
  [Trepcea] Here one gets the impression that the officials in 
Strasbourg would like the period that separates us from the 
coming into effect of the protocol to be as short as possible, 
because of the presence of the Russian Federation at the gates 
of the Council of Europe. 
  [Melescanu] Yes, this is true that there is this political 
desire. There are also practical reasons, because the current 
difficult mechanism lessens the credibility of the system for 
protecting human rights.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik by </F>
Frits Schaling in Bratislava on 17 May: "Moravcik: A Race 
Against Time"] 
  [Text] The silence in the reception room of Slovak Prime 
Minister Moravcik is broken only by the insistent noise of a 
large, standing 19th-century clock, whose pendulum slowly and 
provocatively ticks the seconds away. Every half-hour, the 
mechanism makes a grinding noise, reminding everyone that the 
time is slipping by for Moravcik and his coalition government. 
Installed in mid-March, the government now has just a few 
months until the early elections on 30 September and 1 October. 
  It is not an enviable position to be in. Moravcik and his 
government, which comprises three politically very heterogeneous 
parties, must create some order in the economic, administrative, 
and political mess left behind by Vladimir Meciar, the populist 
and just as popular leader of the HZDS (Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia), which, following a frontal assault on his 
politics by Slovak President Michal Kovac, had to leave the 
field. 
  True, the new prime minister knows how to get nice figures 
in 
the popularity polls (about 25 percent), but that is still 9 
percent less that his HZDS rival, who has long been busy with 
his election campaign, in which, as is customary, he tackle not 
so much the issues as the people. 
  Jozef Moravcik, who in 1992 was the last Czech foreign 
minister and the Slovak foreign minister in Meciar's Cabinet, 
remains confident. He still has no time to conduct a campaign. 
He leads his Cabinet and does it conscientiously, soundly, and 
even a bit dully. 
  He feels that his most important task is to quickly mend 
Slovakia's dilapidated image. The biggest obstacle to this is 
the time factor. So how big are the chances of the Slovak 
Government's winning this race against time? 
  Moravcik answered the question with apparent reluctance. "It 
is indeed a race for which we have little time. There is only 
one way to win this race: Be consistent and systematic. First, 
the problems must be solved. These decisions were always 
postponed by the last government. The most important thing in 
this respect is privatization. We have to solve the problem of 
coupon privatization. We have already approved the time frame 
for this: The voucher booklets will be sold to the people in 
early September. Another problem is the budget. We are trying to 
maintain the deficit at 4 percent of the GNP. We want more 
favorable conditions for loans from businesses. The situation 
is not at all rosy as regards the financing of education and 
health care." 
  Later this month, an IMF delegation will investigate the 
possibility of giving Slovakia a stand-by loan of $230 million. 
The condition for this loan is that Slovakia bring its budget 
deficit down from 23 to 6 billion krone (1.3 billion guilders 
[G] to G360 million). That will seem daring to a great many 
Slovak voters. 
  Moravcik said: "The only way is to convince them that these 
resources are needed to stabilize the country's financial 
situation. Everyone feels the problems in this area very 
acutely." 
  One of the government's most important goals is to restore 
international confidence in Slovakia and to attract foreign 
capital and investment. "We feel that people accept us and that 
we are successfully creating a positive attitude about 
ourselves. However, there is one problem: On the one hand, 
people are showing understanding, but, on the other, they are 
playing a waiting game. The crucial moment will come at the end 
of June, when the IMF makes a decision on the standby loan." 
  "For Slovakia, it is not just a question of the standby 
loan," Moravcik said, "but also of the IMF's approval of its 
entire economic policy." 
  During Vladimir Meciar's government, the impression was 
often 
given that Slovakia was a besieged fortress surrounded by 
enemies. What has Moravcik done to change this? 
  "We do not at all have the feeling that we are enemies or 
that we have enemies. Our goal is to bring peace to the 
situation and not to get embroiled in counterproductive 
controversies. We are going to convince the voters that 
antagonistic politics does not offer any prospects for this 
country." 
  One of the most controversial problems in Slovak domestic 
and 
foreign policy is the position of the Hungarian minority (11.5 
percent of the population) and relations with Hungary. The last 
government tried to limit minority rights and took a tough 
confrontational stance vis-a-vis Budapest. The new government 
has taken a completely different tack: Not only was Moravcik's 
coalition government set up with support from the Hungarian 
minority party, but it also immediately began to improve the 
climate between Bratislava and Budapest. After much to-ing and 
fro-ing, this resulted in a talk between Moravcik and Hungarian 
Prime Minister Boross. "We wanted a meeting on a higher, 
official level, but we could not agree on the content of the 
communique, so we sought out another forum and decided on an 
informal meeting. In this way, we wanted to demonstrate that, 
although we are not currently in a position to resolve a number 
of open questions, such as the immutability of borders, the 
political will is there to seek out solutions in a friendly 
atmosphere."

  [Text] News just in from the Croatian Assembly. Branimir 
Bilic has a report: 
  [Bilic] Dear viewers, good evening again. The Croatian 
Democratic Union [HDZ] and opposition parties are currently 
giving a news conference in the Croatian Assembly. A short 
while ago a final agreement was signed between the ruling and 
opposition parties. The result of the agreement is the 
following: 
  The posts of the speakers of the Chamber of Representatives 
and the House of Counties will go to the ruling HDZ; the current 
speakers of the two chambers, Stjepan Mesic and Josip Manolic, 
have placed their posts at the disposal of the Croatian Assembly 
in line with this agreement. 
  In the Chamber of Representatives, two posts of deputy 
speaker will go to the parliamentary opposition parties, two to 
the deputies of the Croatian Democratic Union, and one to a 
deputy from ethnic communities or national minorities. 
  In the House of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, one post 
of deputy speaker will be occupied by the HDZ, while two posts 
of deputy speaker will go to parliamentary opposition parties. 
Posts of the first deputy speaker in both chambers will go to 
deputies of parliamentary opposition parties. 
  The number of parliamentary committees will also increase to 
reflect the newly-created situation between the number of 
deputies and individual parties in the chambers. This means 
that there will be a reshuffle of committee chairmen and their 
deputies and as a result the number of chairman positions to be 
occupied by the HDZ and the parliamentary opposition parties 
will be in proportion to the number of their deputies in the 
Croatian Parliament. 
  If a committee is chaired by a deputy from the HDZ, its 
deputy chairman will be from the parliamentary opposition and 
vice-versa. In the committees where the chairman comes from the 
ranks of the HDZ, the HDZ will have the majority -- in 
proportion to the number of deputies in the parliament. The 
committees where the chairman is from the parliamentary 
opposition will have the same number of HDZ and opposition 
deputies. The status of the ethnic community and national 
minorities is not subject to proportional representation. These 
elections will take place at the next session of the 
parliamentary chambers. 
  New procedure books for the Chamber of Representatives and 
the House of Counties will be drawn up. Draft procedure books 
will be formulated by a working group to be set up on a parity 
basis and in accordance with the procedure books used by 
European countries with a highly-developed level of democracy. 
The working group will also be appointed at the next session of 
the parliament. The deadline for drawing up both procedure 
books is 90 days from the day the agreement was reached. 
  According to the agreement, the House of Counties will 
resume 
work on Monday, 23 May 1994, and the Chamber of Representatives 
on Tuesday, 24 May 1994, with the election of the presidents of 
the chambers and their deputies on the agenda.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 18 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of 
the Yugoslav Federal Government, Zeljko Simic, said on Wednesday 
[18 May] that the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) should once 
again adopt an impartial position in performing its peacekeeping 
mission on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. During talks 
with UNPROFOR director for civil affairs, Serge de Melle, and 
with the coordinator for civil affairs at the Belgrade 
headquarters of the "blue helmets", Vladislam Gerasev, Simic 
said that UNPROFOR should do everything possible to inform the 
U.N. and world public opinion in a timely manner about the real 
situation in war-torn regions. 
  By so doing UNPROFOR will restore the credibility it needs 
to 
take part in appeasing tension and establish lasting peace in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. The Yugoslav Ministry 
of Information announced that the representatives of UNPROFOR 
informed simic about the implementation of the agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities in the region of Gorazde, a Moslem 
enclave in the east of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] in which war has been raging between 
local Serbs, Croats and Moslems for over two years. 
  The agreement was signed here on April 22 by representatives 
of the U.N. and the Bosnian Serb republic, a state of Bosnian 
Serbs. 
  Simic told UNPROFOR representatives that the civil war in 
B-H 
should not be viewed only from the angle of certain hotbeds, 
such as Gorazde, since there are other areas, such as Brcko (in 
the north-east of B-H) which, he said, are potentially more 
dangerous and which are directly provoked by the Moslem side 
whose political and military acts are often kept secret and 
hushed up. Simic pointed out that Bosnian Serbs have objective 
reasons for dissastifaction and caution towards UNPROFOR due to 
certain indiscretions committed by the "blue helmets". He cited 
as an example the direct participation of the Nordic battalion 
of UNPROFOR on the side of Moslems in clashes in the region of 
Tuzla (north-east B-H), last week. Simic stressed that the 
Yugoslav Government will continue to extend its help to UNPROFOR 
to stabilize the situation in B-H in order to create 
pre-conditions to continue talks for finding a lasting political 
solution to the conflict, in accordance with the foreign policy 
of the country. Finally, Simic expressed his gratitude to 
UNPROFOR representatives and to the special envoy of U.N. 
secretary general, Yasushi Akashi, for their efforts to overcome 
the crisis in B-H.

  [Text] The latest Geneva declaration and the division of 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina into two parts is acceptable for 
the Serbian side in principle, but there will be many 
difficulties concerning the envisaged percentages. This was 
stated for SRNA by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the people's 
assembly of the Serbian republic. I do not want to prejudice 
any solutions, but at this moment I do not see any way of 
satisfying Croatian-Muslim demands, Krajisnik said. 
  The Serbs do not want anyone else's land. We are defending 
our ethnic regions in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
following this principle, the Serbian side is prepared to give 
up part of the territory that is holding at present, even some 
land that it owns, which amounts to 64 percent, for the benefit 
of creating the compactness of the state, Krajisnik said. 
  For the principle, the Serbs will give up parts of the 
territory, but only up to the percent that will not endanger the 
vital interests of the Serbian people. These interests are the 
definitive separation from the Croats and the Muslims and a 
compact state territory, which above all means a corridor 
through the Posavina region, the chairman of the Serbian 
republic assembly explained, adding that other strategic 
interests of the Serbian people, which cannot be given up at any 
cost, are the ethnic regions along the Una, Drina, and Neretva 
Rivers. 
  The Serbian side has many objections to the Geneva 
declaration, but we are currently ignoring them for the benefit 
of the positive shifts, thus leaving room for ending hostilities 
and searching for a mutually agreed solution, Momcilo Krajisnik 
stressed in his interview with SRNA.

  [Text] An inaugural meeting of the government Committee for 
Defense Matters has been in progress for an hour. The committee 
is discussing a report on the state of Poland's defense prepared 
by the Ministry of National Defense. Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk said before the meeting that it would be a bad 
thing if the NATO states give Russia a privileged position in 
the Partnership for Peace program. 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Such a solution would 
contradict the idea of the Partnership. It is true that Russia 
still remains a superpower and has the right to negotiate 
various treaties with the United States and with NATO as a 
whole, but not within the framework of the Partnership for Peace 
initiative, which would then become doubtful. [end recording] 
  According to Minister Kolodziejczyk, the reduction of 
Russian 
troops from 200,000 to 25,000 in the Kaliningrad district may be 
carried out soon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F>
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Ryszard Bilski and Maciej 
Lukasiewicz; place and date not given: "Our Border Is Open to 
the Greeks"] 
  [Excerpts] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A great achievement is the 
fact that talks have finally been held between Greece and 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
(in New York, with the participation of Cyrus Vance) -- you told 
RZECZPOSPOLITA in late August of last year. You also expressed 
great satisfaction with the fact that both parties had 
unanimously agreed that they would continue talks until the 
dispute was settled. Unfortunately, the talks were soon broken 
off. What is more, Greece once again imposed a blockade on 
Macedonia -- first of all it denied it the access to the seaport 
at Salonika. What led to this sudden increase in the tension 
between Athens and Skopje? 
  [Gligorov] The Republic of Macedonia has all along believed, 
and it still does, that direct talks are the only way to settle 
any disputes. I do not know any more effective method. Only 
political dialogue at a common table can help reach a compromise. 
  Last year's talks at the United Nations were indeed very 
promising. Unfortunately, Greece unilaterally broke them off. 
It justified this decision with the holding of parliamentary 
elections, which, incidentally, was true. One could accept this 
argument if, after the elections, the dialogue had been resumed. 
Such a course of events might then be considered normal. 
However, this did not take place. 
  It is worth recalling that as early as the election 
campaign, 
Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] supported slogans that 
were very radical and not conducive to the climate of 
reconciliation; when the new authorities came to power, they did 
not only make no any attempts to resume the talks, but in 
addition a decision was made to further flame the political 
atmosphere, which was already very hot and unfavorable for us. 
  Thus, populist undertakings were chosen. At great rallies 
the nationalistic passions were further excited. This method 
could only lead to the radicalization of public opinion, to the 
decreasing of maneuverability, and to the limiting of the role 
of the Greek delegation in further talks. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Exactly. Can you see any chances of 
resuming the Macedonian-Greek dialogue? What concessions is 
Skopje prepared to make, and what concessions does it expect 
from Athens? 
  [Gligorov] The Greek economic embargo has considerably 
deteriorated our economic situation, which was already 
difficult; this poor economic situation was caused by the 
sanctions slapped against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
which was one of our important economic partners. We have not 
retaliated and will not retaliate by imposing a similar embargo. 
We will not organize any rallies intensifying the anti-Greek 
atmosphere in Macedonia in reply to the Greek rallies. Our 
borders are wide open to the Greeks and to Greek commodities. 
[passage omitted] 
  The dispute between Macedonia and Greece is irrational. It 
is emotional and does not make any sense. We are, after all, 
close nations, with a common religion and possibly good 
prospects for economic cooperation. Macedonia is the Greek road 
to Europe and Greece -- the Macedonian access to the sea. We 
are a small, peaceloving country. We have made it clear in our 
Constitution that we have no territorial claims on any of our 
neighbors. We are not a military superpower that might threaten 
Greece, which has five times as many inhabitants as we do. 
Moreover, Greece is a member of NATO and the European Union. 
Thus, if one takes into account all these things, one cannot 
help but draw the conclusion that it is possible to resolve this 
irrational dispute through rational means. [passage omitted] 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What hopes do you pin on Macedonia's 
participation in the Central European Initiative? 
  [Gligorov] My country is definitely pro-European. We 
believe that the integration of the Republic of Macedonia with 
this European association is the most important, fundamental 
goal for us. We link it to the process of Europeanization of 
the entire Balkans and Eastern Europe. We believe that it 
results from the internal need of the individual states -- from 
the new European architecture. The Central European Initiative 
may be of great assistance in the process of accelerating the 
introduction of European Standards, in the integration of states 
of the post-socialist region with the EC. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] It is here, in Skopje, that we heard of the 
idea of forming a Slavic-Orthodox alliance. What is your 
opinion on this initiative and would Macedonia join such a union? 
  [Gligorov] I believe that any ideas concerning new 
alliances, such as Slavic-Orthodox, Muslim, or others, are 
detrimental; they may prove tragic for the Balkans and for 
Europe. Along with the downfall of socialism and the division 
into blocs, Europe had a great chance to overcome and curb the 
process of creating new ethnic, religious, and other divisions. 
Such alliances mean a return to painful experiences, as well as 
the creation of new conflicts and a road leading to calamities. 
The Republic of Macedonia would not decide to enter into such 
alliances, today or ever. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Macedonia was the first country to which UN 
peacekeeping forces were sent before -- as it is most often 
called -- the "fire" broke out. What is your evaluation of the 
preventive policy of the West in this part of Europe? Do you 
feel safe? How can lasting peace be ensured in the Balkans? 
  [Gligorov] The preventative mission of UN forces in 
Macedonia is of great importance, which extends beyond our 
borders. It was a wise, far-reaching decision. The settlement 
of conflicts, the prevention of fires makes far greater sense 
than putting them out only later on. The UN forces in the 
Republic of Macedonia, which also include a U.S. contingent 
(almost half of the soldiers), give us a feeling of greater 
security. The presence of the said units is interpreted as 
proof of UN and U.S. support for the maintenance of Macedonia's 
territorial integrity, peace, and stabilization. Lasting peace 
in the Balkans can be guaranteed first of all through respect 
for and maintenance of the present borders, prevention of any 
attempts to alter them by force, countering of the policy of 
ethnic cleansing, and the granting of rights to national 
minorities. The policy of territorial claims, breaches of human 
rights and the rights of minorities, as well as the cultivation 
of historical myths and territorial appetites may only lead to 
new conflicts. Tragic proof of this is the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Every now and then there appear disquieting 
reports about preparations on part of the Albanian minority 
(according to official data, they constitute 20 percent of the 
population, whereas the Albanians claim that they represent 40 
percent) to gain -- even with the use of force -- considerable 
autonomy. In this connection there are rumors about the danger 
of the outbreak of civil war, about the danger of drawing the 
Albanians from Kosovo and from Albania into such a conflict. 
Also, the possibility of an armed intervention by Serbia is 
taken into account. How can "the writing" of this tragic 
scenario be prevented? 
  [Gligorov] In the Republic of Macedonia, aside from the 
Macedonian people (approximately 69 percent of the population), 
live many national minorities. The most numerous is the 
Albanian minority (approximately 21 percent of the population). 
There are also Turks, Gypsies, Romanians, and Serbs. This year 
we will conduct a national census, under the auspices of 
European establishments, to once and for all dispell the myths 
and end the speculations about the size of the minorities, 
especially the Albanian minority. This minority has several 
parties, two of which are represented in parliament and 
constitute the third most numerous political force. 
Representatives of this minority are also members of the 
coalition government. 
  It is true that certain radical groups or individuals are 
making attempts to establish semi-military organizations, but 
they do not meet with great support from the Albanian community 
in Macedonia. I believe that this is mainly because the 
Albanians and the Macedonians have never in their history been 
in a conflict. Thus, prevailing is the striving for 
coexistence, mutual respect, tolerance, and dialogue. 
  All the predictable "black scenarios," which you have 
mentioned, will be real as long as the Bosnian "fire" is raging. 
They will be dangerous until the situation in Kosovo is normal. 
Also, one cannot rule out the possibility of any outside 
attempts to destabilize the situation in our Republic. Each of 
these dangers threatens an all-Balkan fire, which might soon 
spread to the whole of Europe. Frankly, I hope that this will 
not take place. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Crvenkovski Moderate Optimist"] </F>
  [Text] Reserved optimism for the course of the 
Macedonian-Greek negotiations was expressed by Macedonia's [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign 
Relations Minister Stevo Crvenkovski in his statement for 
MAKPRESS after yesterday's one hour meeting in New York with the 
UN and U.S. mediators Cyrus Vance and Matthew Nimitz. 
  Reminding of the agreement reached with the [words 
indistinct] details of the negotiations, Crvenkovski did not 
want to comment on the basis for this feeling that "there are 
possibilities" that things will move from the standstill. 
  Commenting on the proposal for a new name, "Northern 
Macedonia," that was allegedly made by the American mediator 
Matthew Nimitz, Crvenkovski said: "In this phase we have as yet 
not reached any concrete proposals, especially not about the 
name," but ways are being sought out to continue the dialogue 
which is in the interest of both sides. 
  It is reported from New York that, depending on the results 
of the meeting with Vance scheduled for late last night, 
Minister Crvenkovski may leave for Washington for several 
meetings. 
  Up until today no progress has been made, stated yesterday 
in 
New York the Greek ambassador Zaharakis after the meeting with 
Cyrus Vance. Zaharakis denied the speculations in the press 
according to which the U.S. mediator Nimitz presented proposals 
for the name: "New" or "Northern" Macedonia. Replying to a 
question Zaharakis said: "Mr. Nimitz has not presented any 
proposals, he simply participates in the procedure for the 
exchange of opinion."

<F P=106> ["m.t."-signed interview with Ferenc Kosa, parliamentary </F>
deputy of the Hungarian Socialist Party; place and date not 
given: "Ferenc Kosa: The Socialists Do Not Want a Clear-Up"] 
  [Text] The media law, which is one of the first to be 
passed by the new parliament, will define the operation of Radio 
and Television and the appointment of their leaders. The 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] instructed Ferenc Kosa to draw 
up the Socialists' media law concept when the party went into 
opposition in 1990. We interviewed Kosa on the media plans of 
the MSZP. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is the MSZP adhering to the basic principles 
that it professed when it was an opposition party? 
  [Kosa] Already in the transitional period before the 1990 
elections, the MSZP was aware that an unbiased, honest, and 
socially supervised operation of the information system -- 
especially public service radio and television -- is a necessary 
prerequisite for democracy. I would like to remind people that, 
after the 40 years of party state dictatorship, the Nemeth 
government set up the Public Supervisory Committee, which, with 
the participation of experts and parties that had national 
lists, ensured television's impartiality during the elections. 
As for the media law, the MSZP's concept has three cardinal 
points: public ownership, public supervision, and clear and 
unequivocal public service statutes. In respect to public 
service media, we rejected both state ownership and free market 
ownership. If the radio and television are in state ownership 
then the government of the day can influence their operation. 
We do not support the free market, either, because foreign 
interests can endanger national sovereignty. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Who should own the public service media? 
  [Kosa] The MSZP considers socialist ownership in its 
classical sense appropriate, namely public ownership. Legally, 
the public foundation corresponds to this. The public 
foundation is a form of ownership that cannot be sold, which is 
created by a two-thirds majority decision of Parliament, and 
which does not operate under the government's or any party's 
influence, and not even solely under Parliament's influence. 
Its Supervisory Board consists of a broad social basis: The 
delegates of political forces, professional trade unions, 
independent personalities, trade unions, and churches. Its 
members can be replaced. This way, it is possible to eliminate 
disproportionately large personal or group interests that can 
appear in the public service media. The Board cannot exercise 
censorship rights. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] Is there any chance for the MSZP's media 
plans to be accepted by parliament? 
  [Kosa] Even in the past, the MSZP's media policy was a 
consensus-making alternative to the government's state ownership 
and the liberals' free market solutions. If the MSZP comes to 
power, it will continue to insist on its basic principles. 
Accordingly, it wants a media and press that are independent of 
the government and political forces. It is a precondition of 
democracy that the press be able to operate freely as a 
criticizing counterbalance to the governing power. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] In recent days, a list of names has come to 
light that foreshadows the dismissals in television that are to 
follow the change of the government.... 
  [Kosa] The Socialists do not have any intentions to clear 
up; the MSZP does not want to replace the personnel in the 
media. We would like the country to be among the leaders in 
Europe as regards democracy and the independence of the public 
service media. The draft bill proposed by us serves this goal. 
  [MAGYAR NEMZET] What are the MSZP's views on the rules of 
appointing radio and television chairmen? 
  [Kosa] The appointment of the chairmen is one paragraph in 
an 800-paragraph draft bill. In accordance with the 
constitutional rules in this area, the prime minister proposes 
the media chairmen, the parliamentary Cultural Committee hears 
them and forms an opinion on them, and finally the president of 
the republic appoints them. In our view, this system is 
democratic. The freely elected responsible government of the 
day should have the possibility to make a proposal on the 
people, but it should not have the sole right to appoint them. 
In this sense, the president of the Republic and the Cultural 
Committee form a counterweight to the government. The basis of 
the process of appointment should not be changed, but it is 
expedient to make minor amendments. It would not be fortuitous 
if parliament appointed the chairmen because it cannot have the 
rights of an employer. The fact that we do not have a legal 
order in this area is the reason for the speculations 
surrounding the issue of media chairmen. When we have a media 
law, the appointment of the chairmen will be a natural procedure 
without any hysteria. This is the reason the MSZP insists that 
the issue of the media chairmen only be put on the agenda once 
the media law is passed.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "The Involvement of the </F>
Romanian National Unity Party in the Caritas Game"] 
  [Text] For some time now the leaders of the Romanian 
National Unity Party [PUNR] have been making desperate efforts 
to prove that their party has nothing to do with Caritas. 
Moreover, in their efforts to dissociate themselves from 
[Caritas Director] Ioan Stoica, they went so far as to claim 
that it was not the PUNR, but rather another party, the 
Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] that had 
been the protector of the great nationwide con. Why the PD(FSN) 
and not another political grouping? Because [PD(FSN) President] 
Petre Roman's party is being used by the current government 
coalition worse than the kulak subject was exploited in 
proletarian literature. Whenever a post-December 1989 disaster 
occurs, it is immediately blamed on the Roman government. The 
proletarian writers were always blaming the fat kulak for all 
the mishaps in the village: for the threshing machine being 
offbeat, for the wheat failing to sprout, and even for the lack 
of rain. For the propaganda machine of the current left-wing 
coalition, Petre Roman's party is responsible for all past, 
present, and future evils. The PD(FSN) is to be blamed for the 
scope of corruption, for the huge number of unemployed, and for 
the holes in the pavement. Therefore, in blaming the PD(FSN) 
for Caritas, the PUNR leaders cannot boast that they have shown 
a great amount of originality. At best, they have showed a bit 
of cowardice. 
  The whole country was and is aware of the fact that the 
responsibility for the setting up and expansion of Caritas 
belongs to the PUNR. As shown by the group of items published 
on page 3 of today's issue of our newspaper, Ioan Stoica enjoyed 
the unconditional and direct support of PUNR President Gheorghe 
Funar. Without his decisive support, Caritas would have never 
reached such fame, which went even beyond Romania's borders. 
The Caritas kind of game relies on the constant difference 
between the number of people who deposit their money and those 
who cash it. The more the number of depositors exceeds the 
number of receivers, the better the game can ensure the 
multiplication of the sum of money due to be cashed. This vital 
difference requires that increasingly more citizens take the 
company's cashier desks by assault to deposit their money. 
However, this requires that the citizens must have trust in the 
seriousness of the game. Consequently, the explosion of Caritas 
was made possible by the much greater trust put in this game, 
than in other similar games throughout the country. This was 
due both to Ioan Stoica's ability to project himself as a 
messiah and to the categorical support lent to Caritas by a man 
of Gheorghe Funar's caliber: PUNR president and Cluj mayor. 
Therefore, no matter how hard the other PUNR leaders tried to 
prove to the contrary, Gheorghe Funar's responsibility stands 
beyond any doubt. As a matter of fact, since he is a correct 
man, the PUNR president reiterated his public support for 
CARITAS at the end of last week. What else can his eulogy of 
the bankrupt Cluj game be -- at a time when everybody has 
realized that it is a swindle -- other than a declaration of 
public support for it? Even though it was done pretty much 
indiscreetly, the PUNR leaders have tried to distance the party 
from Gheorghe Funar in the matter of the Caritas affair. For 
instance, they said that the PUNR president's support for 
Caritas does not mean that the party also supported it. They 
also maintain that the Cluj mayor's involvement in this affair 
has nothing to do with his capacity as PUNR president, but that 
he did it as a private person. However, these are but sophisms 
of people with their backs to the wall! The trust of the 
Caritas depositors relied on the fact that the game was 
supported not by just anybody, but by a prominent political 
figure. If the party had dissociated itself from CARITAS and 
Gheorghe Funar at the appropriate time, by publicly condemning 
not only the game, but also the Cluj mayor's involvement, the 
people would have been more prudent before giving away their 
shirts to enrich Ioan Stoica. But then, the PUNR was quiet at 
the time, thus conveying the impression that all of it supports 
the Caritas scheme. The current gesture comes too late. 
Gheorghe Funar's involvement throws the burden of 
responsibility onto the whole party. Any public trial of the 
disaster called Caritas will have to examine the PUNR's 
involvement in the affair, as it will also be unable to avoid 
examining the dubious role played by certain journalists in the 
dissemination of the swindle. 
  Nevertheless, there is still a salvation for the PUNR, 
namely 
to publicly condemn, in particularly firm terms, Gheorghe 
Funar's guilt in the Caritas affair. Likewise, it should rid 
itself of its president, by invoking the legal proceedings 
against Caritas. But this is a difficult, if not impossible, 
thing to do, without risking a major convulsion within the PUNR.

<F P=106> [Nord-Est Press report: "Russian Ultranationalist Leader </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy Will Not Receive Entry Visa to Romania"] 
  [Text] On 14 May the leadership of the PNT [National 
Peasant Party]-Lambru, a small political group that withdrew 
from the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party], 
made public its intention to invite Russian ultranationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to visit Romania, parliamentary 
sources announced. The reason for this invitation, according to 
the PNT-Lambru, is the fact that the Russian politician is "a 
person who has a thorough knowledge of the true history of 
Romania." Authorized sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
informed us a few days ago that it is out of the question that 
the Russian extremist can receive an entry visa to Romania. We 
wish to remind our readers that a few months ago the Russian 
leader sketched a "map of Europe" in which Romania is not 
included at all as a state.

  [Text] The National Assembly today voted to reject the 
proposed structural changes to the Council of Ministers. The 
deputies debated the proposed personnel changes to the cabinet 
but did not take a vote. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov asked for 
a vote of confidence in his government. The National Assembly 
deputies will take the vote next Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Zhan Videnov, BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader, told a 
BTA correspondent that the BSP rejected President Zhelyu 
Zhelev's proposal to meet to discuss the government's problems 
because the party considers that the country has a cabinet. 
According to Videnov, the BSP would support the vote of 
confidence in the cabinet if Professor Berov keeps to his 
earlier proposals for changes in the executive. 
  Meanwhile, the parliamentary groups of the BSP and its 
coalition and the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] are 
holding meetings in parliament to discuss the situation that has 
developed.

relations with the Russian Federation and wants to have friendly 
relations in all areas, President of the Republic of Croatia 
Franjo Tudjman said in an interview with reporters of leading 
Russian media in Zagreb today. 
  Answering questions by reporters from Russian state 
television, ITAR-TASS, and the newspaper MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 
President Tudjman stressed that relations which existed before 
the formation of the sovereign, independent, and democratic 
Croatia only continued following the establishment of diplomatic 
ties between the two countries. He said that Russia had so far 
played a positive role in the search for a political solution to 
the crisis in the region. He particularly stressed the role of 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Russian president's 
special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, at the Geneva conference. They 
tried to exert influence on Serbia and the Serbs in Croatia to 
honor Croatia's internationally recognized borders. 
  President Tudjman also spoke in favorable terms about the 
economic relations between the two countries and said that great 
successes had been made in that sphere.

TV-BEST showed. After the breaking up of the ruling Croatian 
Democratic Union (HDZ) which resulted in a parliamentary crisis 
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, the poll was 
conducted on a representative sample of 2,000 people. As many 
as 50.7 percent of Croatian citizens said they were dissatisfied 
with the situation in Croatia and 32.8 percent that they were 
very dissatisfied. The major cause of dissatisfaction for more 
than 85 percent of Croatians is a drop of living standard and 
theft while for 60 percent of the polled said the major cause of 
all troubles was incompetence of the country's leadership. The 
Republic of Croatia proclaimed independence in January 1992 
after violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation.

  [Text] Warsaw, 20 May--European Commission President 
Jacques Delors met this morning with members of the Sejm and 
Senate Presidia and with the chairmen of the Sejm Commissions 
for Foreign Affairs and for European Treaty Matters. 
  After the meeting, Jan Borkowski, chairman of the Commission 
for European Treaty Matters, said that the most important issue 
discussed today was a proposal by Polish parliament members for 
Poland to participate in the work of setting up the new European 
Union [EU] institutions that are to emerge after the states of 
Central and East Europe are accepted as members of the 
organization. 
  According to Borkowski, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy suggested 
during the talks that Poland should gain permanent observer 
status in the European Parliament. Borkowski said Delors agreed 
that an initiative should be taken to enable Poland to cooperate 
in reforming the EU. He added that Poland does not want only to 
be a recipient of EU decisions and to stand outside, but that it 
also wants to contribute to the creation of new structures in 
which it is going to participate in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by </F>
correspondent Paolo Borrella; place and date not given; Walesa 
speaks in Polish with superimposed Italian translation--recorded] 
  [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa was present at the 
Monte Cassino celebrations. Walesa remembered the sacrifice of 
thousands of his fellow countrymen who took part in that battle 
along with Allied forces in this way. 
  [Walesa] The Polish people fought on every front during 
World 
War II. They fought, above all, for the liberation of Europe. 
They fought for the people of Poland only in the second 
instant. As early as 1939, we knew that not only Poland but 
also the destiny of Europe was at stake, but they did not listen 
to us. In this way, we had to fight to put right the errors 
made by others. 
  [Borrelli] But do you not run the risk of creating a Europe 
based solely on business interests rather than a Europe based on 
those values that everyone wanted during the struggle against 
Nazism? 
  [Walesa] Obviously this risk exists, but the principles will 
always win in the end. Some questions are of common interest. 
I am thinking of the question of nuclear power stations. The 
safeguarding of the environment must be the responsibility of 
everyone. Europe cannot allow situations like that in the 
former Yugoslavia to arise. When I hear people say that in 
order to allow Russia to join the security organization named 
"Partnership for Peace" different rules to those of other 
countries will be applied, I cannot see how this will work. 
  [Borrelli] In Russia, your powerful neighbor, Boris 
Yeltsin's 
power is threatened by Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy. Does this 
worry you? 
  [Walesa] We do not constitute a desired object for Russia. 
If 
anything, you run this risk. The only solution is for Europe to 
extend in order to include the countries of the former communist 
bloc. In this way, common security and wealth are increased and 
uncertainties are reduced.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 19 May--On 19 May, Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak received Josef Lux, deputy prime minister and 
agriculture minister of the Czech Republic, who is in Poland on 
a one-day visit. Issues connected with "the intensification of 
trade in agricultural and food products between our countries 
and the repayment of Polish debts in the Czech Republic" were 
among the subjects of the talks, Andrzej Smietanko, the Polish 
minister of agriculture, told journalists after the meeting. 
  The Polish debt in the Czech Republic amounts to 
approximately $57 million. At the meeting, it was agreed that 
we would be repaying it by investing in areas on the Czech side 
of the border. Construction of border crossings and ecology 
projects, mainly sewage-treatment plants, are envisaged. 
  The Polish minister reported on work on agreements on 
cooperation in the field of veterinary medicine and plant 
protection, as well as an agreement on cooperation between the 
Polish and Czech agriculture ministries. [passage omitted] 
  Lux gave an assurance that land belonging to Polish farmers 
but lying on the Czech side of the border and land belonging to 
Czech farmers but lying on the Polish side would not become a 
subject of tension between the governments. "We will not allow 
any border changes," Lux said. "Irrespective of which citizen 
owns land in Poland or the Czech Republic, he will be subject to 
the law of the country where his land is," he added. 
  Lux expressed the hope that the law on subsidies of certain 
groups of goods that had been adopted by the Sejm "would not 
lead to any restrictions in trade between our two countries."

<F P=106> [From the "Wiadomosci" newscast; relayed by Warsaw TV </F>
Polonia Network in Polish] 
  [Text] [Announcer Grazyna Bukowska] The Defense Affairs 
Committee of the Council of Ministers decided at its first 
meeting that, until the time of changes in the Constitution, the 
chief of the General Staff will continue to be subject to the 
national defense minister. President Lech Walesa, on the other 
hand, wants the chief of staff to be directly subject to him, as 
the head of the Armed Forces. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Ministers 
explained that they were unable to make another decision because 
the president has agreed with the ruling coalition that there 
could be no changes in the structure of power before the 
adoption of the new constitution. 
  [National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk] Today, the 
committee decided to indicate to the Council of Ministers the 
second option--that is, that option in which the chief of the 
General Staff remains subject to the national defense minister. 
That is the option that has been in place hitherto. 
  [Walesa] This is still under discussion. I will be speaking, 
I will be demonstrating, that the first option is the better 
one. And I think we will find a compromise. 
  [Correspondent] During the deliberations today, the 
government Defense Affairs Committee created an interministerial 
crisis team that will permanently observe all threats to the 
security of the state. The National Defense Ministry deems one 
of the greatest dangers to be the presence of a large number of 
Russian forces in the Kaliningrad District. Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk said today that he had obtained a promise from 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of a significant 
reduction of forces in this district. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] As a final figure, there are to be 
altogether 
25,000 soldiers and sailors stationed in this region--a clear, 
far-reaching reduction of the present state of affairs, which is 
about 200,000. If this stated intention is sincere, the problem 
ceases to exist. 
  [Correspondent] According to the National Defense Ministry, 
Poland has no strategic reserves in the case of war. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The mobilization reserves are significantly 
reduced. We are eating them away by virtue of the miserliness 
of the budget. 
  [Correspondent] The Defense Ministry claims that the Polish 
Army, in wishing to measure up to the armament levels of the 
NATO states, will have to spend $2.5 billion [word indistinct] 
up until the year 2010. The Defense Ministry feels that, during 
this period, it is appropriate to exploit the favorable 
international circumstances and prepare for eventual threats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michal Strak, chief of the Office of the </F>
Council of Ministers, URM, by Agnieszka Kublik and Wojciech 
Zaluska; place and date not given: "Government's Time-Slot; 
Conversation With URM Chief Michal Strak"] 
  [Text] [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Is it true that you want to see 
an amendment to the Law on Radio and Television to enable the 
government to have its own program on television? 
  [Strak] Yes, it is. I suggest that the government have its 
own time slot on public television a few times a week and at an 
appropriate time. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Meaning? 
  [Strak] Meaning a time when information programs are 
broadcast. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] What kind of program is it supposed to be? 
  [Strak] It would be the kind of program where the government 
would be able to portray itself the way it wants. In the 
program, the government would speak about itself and its 
responsibility. This way, we will prevent situations such as on 
"Wiadomosci" [main television newscast] on 17 May, where I had 
spoken a sentence out of which television people selected only 
half, thus completely changing the meaning of the statement. We 
continue to be the target of unprofessional or intentional 
maneuvering. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So, in this government program, there will 
be just the camera and a minister? 
  [Strak] I can guarantee you that we will utilize experts. 
After all, it was precisely GAZETA WYBORCZA that said that the 
Polish Peasant Party's election campaign on television was one 
of the best. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] And where were your experts when the prime 
minister decided to fly to Italy with his wife and two children, 
when the government insisted it did not have enough money to 
transport war veterans? 
  [Strak] Let us not go back to that. Everything has already 
been said on the subject. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So you want to have your own "Directly 
from the Office of the Council of Ministers"? 
  [Strak] The name is irrelevant. It is going to be like in 
the case of election programs... 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] ...Polish Television is not responsible 
for 
the program's contents? 
  [Strak] Exactly. I am hoping that a program like this will 
ease tensions between politicians and television reporters. For 
instance, "Wiadomosci" on Tuesday showed clips of the prime 
minister visiting the pope, and, of course, neither his wife nor 
his children were shown. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Is that a terrible mistake? 
  [Strak] Yes, it is because the prime minister repeatedly 
explained that he was taking the family along with him on the 
Italian trip precisely because of the meeting with the pope. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So, in this government time slot, the 
prime minister would be shown along with his wife and children? 
  [Strak] Exactly. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Such government programs do not enjoy 
enormous audiences. 
  [Strak] I am not saying this is going to be a "Dynasty," but 
those who are interested in politics will definitely watch the 
program. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So the government wants a time slot for 
itself because it does not like "Wiadomosci"? 
  [Strak] There is a popular view that the media portray the 
government in a biased way. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Why is that? 
  [Strak] There are three possible reasons: both we and the 
journalists are not professional enough; we differ in our 
political views; or there is bad will. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] How do you think the "Wiadomosci" people 
should have reacted when the prime minister sent over his 
two-page communique? 
  [Strak] That was the first case in which the government 
wanted its communique to be read. Strikes were in progress and 
the situation was abnormal. The point was to ease the tension. 
At such points, journalists must not arbitrarily select certain 
parts from the prime minister's speech. They think they are 
holding just a gun in their hands, whereas, in fact, it is a 
cannon. 
  The force of influence that "Wiadomosci" has is enormous. 
  In my view, a professional journalist should consult the 
government over what he will read on the program. I am 
absolutely certain of that. This is what would have happened in 
any civilized country. 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] But this was a very poorly written text. 
Besides, it would have taken four minutes to read it. 
  [Strak] She could have said: "We are not responsible for 
what is in the text, and we are hereby extending this edition of 
`Wiadomosci' by four minutes." How is the prime minister 
supposed to rule the country if it is journalists who decide 
what he is supposed to say? 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Does this "government time slot" idea mean 
that the government intends to give up its fight with the 
National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT]? 
  [Strak] There are some who think that personnel replacements 
would be the answer to the current problems... 
  [GAZETA WYBORCZA] You mean, for instance, replacing Polish 
Television's Chairman Wieslaw Walendziak as well as KRRiT? 
  [Strak] Exactly. But, as for myself, I tend to lean toward 
the idea that it would be enough just to design a decent 
television program for the government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol by </F>
Piotr Andrzejewski and Piotr Gabryel; place and date not given: 
"Political Economics"] 
  [Text] [WPROST] You have completed negotiations with the 
striking unionists of the hard-coal-mining branch. You have 
also ended negotiations with the "lignite" branch. What other 
negotiations remain? 
  [Pol] There is still the sector of liquid fuels, the 
shipbuilding industry, heavy chemistry, the fertilizer industry, 
perhaps the metallurgy... I hope, however, that the talks will 
not be held with strike committees. I suppose that we will 
discuss the necessity of restructuring these branches with the 
directors of enterprises and the unionists. 
  [WPROST] The agreement reached with the striking lignite 
miners does not change the fact that the establishment of coal 
partnerships has not curbed the growing costs of coal 
extraction. The earning capacity of the mining sector has been 
decreasing since the beginning of the year and so has coal 
extraction, the demand for which is rather limited in the 
country. As a matter of fact, the 300,000 employees might lose 
their jobs. 
  [Pol] I do not think the future is as black as that. Due to 
the scale of employment, production, and exports, mining is 
still one of the most vital sectors of our economy. In the 
future, it will be able to maintain itself and to make 
investments from its own resources. 
  [WPROST] For the time being, the profitability of the coal 
partnerships is "negative." 
  [Pol] Their financial results are still affected by an 
enormous indebtedness, which is now being reduced. The program 
of restructuring the mining sector has not ended at the stage of 
establishing new organisms. It already resulted in a decrease 
in employment by 20,000 people last year, and this process is 
being continued--without any pressure or group layoffs, which is 
important. Every year 20,000 people begin to receive retirement 
pensions. The miners working in the mines that are being 
liquidated are offered jobs at other mines, or the system of 
social protection is built up for the period in which the 
laid-off workers acquire new skills. We are trying to see to it 
that economic requirements do not come into too great a conflict 
with the social ones. 
  [WPROST] Demand for coal today is only half as great as it 
was in the times of "prosperity," when the yearly extraction 
volume neared 200 million tons. 
  [Pol] As far as domestic demand is concerned, it will not 
really increase in the next few years. However, exports and 
profitability will be very important. 
  [WPROST] Our extraction costs are two or three times as high 
as those borne by American, Australian, or South African 
exporters. 
  [Pol] The Australians have their coal a few meters under the 
ground; they often need nothing more than a good bulldozer to 
get free access to it. To get our coal, we have to dig deeply 
into the ground, hundreds of meters, which costs a lot of money. 
However, in the western German union lands, for instance, in 
mines that are geologically comparable to ours, the extraction 
process is "overmechanized," and, as a consequence, their 
extraction costs are higher than ours. Thus, figures are not 
always "fair." As exporters, we also have an edge over others 
thanks to the "geographic rent," which lowers the cost of 
transportation from Poland. All things considered, I would not 
demonize the situation. 
  [WPROST] However, are we not creating a dangerous "museum" 
by setting up coal partnerships in which the low efficiency of 
some mines is "neutralized" by other mines of a given group? As 
a result of agreements with the European Union and the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in a few years, after reducing 
or entirely lifting tariffs, we will become defenseless against 
our competitors, whose products will be much cheaper. 
  [Pol] I do not think our mining sector is a museum. Please 
note that extraction is subsidized in many countries but not in 
Poland. Subsidies concern only the costs of mine liquidation 
and social protection for those who are forced to change jobs. 
It is certainly one of the duties of the coal partnerships to 
protect some of the unprofitable mines. In mining, one mine is 
never profitable forever. As a result of only one cave-in, a 
mine may lose its earning capacity for several years. Thus, the 
partnerships are made up of both good and poor mines. In the 
long run, however, the partnerships will want to lower costs, 
and, naturally, they will "push out" the latter, the poorest 
ones. They will want to close them down, especially the mines in 
which deposits have already been almost entirely exploited. 
  [WPROST] For the time being, however, extraction costs are 
not observed to be decreasing considerably, and the earning 
capacity of mines is becoming increasingly lower. 
  [Pol] My advice is: More patience. Coal partnerships are 
now at the stage of concluding agreements with their creditors 
and with the budget; they are all working on a system of paying 
off the mines' debts. Apart from that, mining is gradually 
getting rid of the nonproductive property. So far, it has been 
burdened with the duty of maintaining streets, stadia, 
hospitals, sanitariums, health centers. This year, all of this 
should yield a financial result that is slightly positive or 
near zero. 
  [WPROST] Now that you have signed an agreement with miners, 
are you not expecting an escalation of pressure from other 
"vital" branches? 
  [Pol] In many countries much more developed than Poland, the 
restructurization of strategic sectors was accompanied by great 
tensions, discussions, and conflicts. Success was or was not 
achieved through compromise. There are countries where 
restructurization of the power industry was suspended because 
the initial attempts brought about such tensions that the 
authorities decided to wait for a better atmosphere. 
  [WPROST] Should the 40 percent of industrial enterprises, 
whose financial results are negative today, wait for a better 
atmosphere, as well? What do you intend to do with the 
"socialist dinosaurs" of our economy? 
  [Pol] Unfortunately, you are now repeating stereotypes. 
When you are speaking about "socialist dinosaurs," you mean... 
  [WPROST] The FSO Automobile Factory, for instance. 
  [Pol] This "dinosaur" contributes well over 1 trillion 
zlotys to the state budget annually. 
  [WPROST] The demand for these products is protected by 
outrageous customs duties, excise, and import tax. 
  [Pol] The customs duty is not all that outrageous at all. 
In India, for example, it is as high as 150 percent of the 
value of a given car. I would like to caution against the 
vision of "let us plough this all up and create a beautiful, 
modern automobile industry meeting world standards." This is 
utopia. Unfortunately, we live off what we have. If some day 
we really opened our borders--and there were such attempts in 
1991 and 1992, when the customs duty did not exceed 4 
percent--the Polish economy would collapse immediately. It is 
worth recalling that thousands of enterprises whose debt burdens 
we are now trying to reduce somehow found themselves in trouble 
in that particular period. You can certainly say: Let us not 
reduce the debts; let them collapse. The problem is that, along 
with them, the whole of Poland would collapse because no one 
would be able to maintain such a large army of unemployed people. 
  [WPROST] Is it not utopia, as well, that all of this can be 
rescued? 
  [Pol] Certainly not all enterprises will make it. I 
believe, however, that, in the case of the sectors that are 
subjected to the restructurizaiton process, the situation will 
be similar to the second year of studies: Generally, everyone 
should survive it, but there is always some percentage that 
fails the exams. In the case of companies, this is an extremely 
slow and difficult process. First, they must come up with "a 
survival idea," and then they can count on the state to help 
them. Unfortunately, the state has also contributed to the 
difficulties they are going through. This is the result of 
certain mistakes that were made in the preliminary stages of 
free-market reforms. 
  [WPROST] However, it is probably difficult to support 
enterprises without finding ways to communicate with their 
employees. In recent weeks, you have been at the forefront of 
the battle between the government and the unions. Did you not 
get the impression that Poland is becoming increasingly more 
deeply divided into two separate worlds, the interests of which 
it will be increasingly harder to reconcile? 
  [Pol] It is certainly difficult to reconcile interests. I 
believe, however, that it is still one Poland with one way of 
thinking. It is obvious that, if you suddenly begin "tampering" 
with the labor-and-wage system of someone who considers his 
situation to be stable and his future to be safe, this will make 
him protest. Concrete information gets across to some people 
more easily than to others. If you add to this such factors as 
politics and the activities of competing trade unions, all of 
this will make for an explosive combination. 
  [WPROST] However, I cannot see the government trying to 
effectively scatter these fears by presenting a coherent and 
clear activity schedule. You were practically alone in 
negotiations with the striking lignite miners. 
  [Pol] I think this looked worse than it really was. Because 
the demands of the strikers concerned one of the strategic 
branches of the industry, I moved to the foreground of events. 
However, later there was cooperation. I cannot really complain 
about being alone. 
  [WPROST] What will the talks on the restructurization of 
other branches look like? Will they be held under a threat of 
strikes? 
  [Pol] We are striving to maintain the configuration that was 
agreed upon in the last negotiations: the government-trade 
unions-employers. 
  [WPROST] However, Solidarity ["S"] is demanding separate 
talks with the government. 
  [Pol] I believe that "S" will finally understand that we are 
not in a position to talk with each union separately. Each of 
them is quite strong, and favoring one of them triggers a chain 
reaction that consists of demands for separate negotiations. 
This is unacceptable to the government. 
  [WPROST] The use of the "trilateral" model at the nationwide 
forum of the commission, which is supposed to be set up by a 
separate law, also creates a danger: It may lead to some kind of 
"corporationism" if not "unioncracy." As a matter of fact, the 
most vital social decisions may be made outside the government 
and the parliament. 
  [Pol] No. I think that it is simply a slow and difficult 
procedure for reaching the final shape of the configuration of 
influence on state affairs. Neither the government nor the 
parliament will agree to be substituted for by the trilateral 
commission; they will not agree that the unions should decide 
issues that are of utmost importance to the state. It so 
happens that it is the government and the parliament that bear 
all responsibility. On the other hand, however, no government in 
a country that has such large union structures as ours can make 
decisions exclusively on its own. It should discuss with the 
unions any moves they are by nature interested in--from social 
issues to issues related to wages. 
  [WPROST] Much seems to suggest that the consecutive 
governments, both the "S" governments and the present Cabinet, 
have not worked out any strategy for resolving the problems of 
"the vital" branches. It seems that the strategy has been 
replaced by the tactics of deferring conflicts and gradually 
neutralizing them in negotiations and strikes. 
  [Pol] Definitely not. Programs concerning restructurization 
have been prepared in detail. They were worked out partially by 
my predecessors, who, however, did not manage to accomplish much 
because they were frequently recalled too soon. Today we are 
preparing a program of restructurization of the liquid fuels 
sector. If this program fails, the Polish fuel industry, which 
is today in pretty good condition, may be obliterated from the 
face of the earth within just a few years--when the contingents 
for fuel imports are lifted and the customs duty is lowered. 
  [WPROST] However, the consciousness of this fact is not 
common. 
  [Pol] Hence the scale of social opposition, whose 
enormousness I realized during negotiations with the lignite 
miners. Hearsay, false information, and mistrust were so 
concentrated there that the union activists, even though they 
realized that the threat caused by the restructurization is not 
really great, did not have the courage to be frank with the 
strikers. Thus, there is a great need to make everyone realize 
the necessity of transformations; people must realize that they 
bring not threats but possibilities for surviving.

  [Text] Koper, Slovenia, May 19 (TANJUG) -- Slovenian Prime 
Minister Janez Drnovsek said on Thursday that the main dispute 
in connection with the state border between Slovenia and Croatia 
in the Bay of Piran in the northern Adriatic might be put to 
international arbitration, because Croatia was not interested in 
a speedy solution of territorial disputes. Slovenia recognizes 
only the republican borders of former Yugoslavia, whereas 
Croatia insists on the Cadastral border between the two former 
Yugoslav republics. The Cadastral border entitles Croatia to 
the entire Bay of Piran, which the republican border bisects 
into two halves. 
  The Slovenian-Croatian border dispute has nearly ruptured 
bilateral relations. Close political cooperation maintained at 
the time of their violent secession from former Yugoslavia [word 
indistinct] has been eroded by numerous economic disputes, 
division of property and mutual debts amounting to hundreds of 
millions of U.S. dollars. 
  Speaking in the port town of Koper in the northern Adriatic, 
near Slovenia's border with Italy, Drnovsek said that Slovenia 
was anticipating a tougher position of Italy concerning its 
territorial claims, which he said would jeopardize Slovenia's 
sovereignty. He explained that the views of the other European 
Union states, and not just Italy, were also relevant in 
connection with this issue. 
  The clamouring of the rightist parties which form the new 
coalition government in Rome for revising the Osimo Accords 
(signed between Italy and former Yugoslavia) are beginning 
seriously to worry the Slovenian leadership. 
  The subject has lately gained prominence in the Slovenian 
media, which are sharply critical of what they see as the 
authorities' docility and are warning that any procrastination 
in dealing with the issues may mean incalculable damage to 
Slovenia. The 1973 Osimo Accords regulated all territorial 
disputes which had existed between Italy and former Yugoslavia 
since World War II.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The </F>
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Ian Mather in Skopje; 
date not given: "The Nation Nobody Will Listen To"] 
  [Text] President Kiro Gligorov heads Europe's most 
beleaguered state. The road to his country from Greece tells 
the story. It is a super-highway built as the main opening to 
the Aegean by Tito's Yugoslavia. Today, you have the road to 
yourself. 
  Since Greece imposed its unilateral embargo against the 
"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" over its claim to use 
the name of Macedonia, the fledgling state has been cut off from 
Thessaloniki, the main port for its trade. 
  As I approached the Macedonian border the eerie silence was 
shattered by rifle shots. Could this be it, I wondered -- the 
start of the next widely-predicted Balkan war in which the 
Macedonian state's predatory neighbours, Albania, Bulgaria, 
Serbia and Greece, and even Nato itself, are likely to become 
embroiled? In the event it turned out to be a Macedonian border 
guard whiling away the time by using a metal advertisement as 
target practice. 
  Apart from that, the only sound on a sunny afternoon was the 
swishing of the wings of house martins which had built their 
nests in the eaves of the huge Customs shed. In the two hours I 
waited for transport at the border only one vehicle, a Danish 
refrigerated truck, appeared. 
  Yet, as President Gligorov pointed out in an interview in 
his 
Skopje office, this is one of the European Union's [EU] borders. 
Greece is a member of the EU, and in the single market uniform 
rules are supposed to apply at all the EU's borders. 
  He is a quietly spoken grey-haired man in a brown suit. The 
large new blood-red flag behind him with its gold Sun of 
Vergina, which is such a red rag to Greece, seems 
inappropriately flamboyant for such an apparently unassuming man. 
  Yet Gligorov's voice rises in passion as he outlines the 
desperate risks his country now faces. Much of his anger is 
reserved for the EU, which he believes has yet another 
potentially disastrous failure in the former Yugoslavia on its 
hands. 
  From his point of view it is all the more galling because 
Greece is an EU member, and should therefore be held accountable 
for its action by the other members, or suffer the consequences. 
When Greece unilaterally imposed a blockade on Macedonia on 14 
February following U.S. recognition of the state, an outraged 
European Commission took Athens to the European Court. Since 
then, nothing has happened. 
  Gligorov said: "This is the first major infringement of the 
Maastricht treaty: the border between Macedonia and Greece is 
not only a national border but a border with the European Union. 
If this precedent is tolerated, it will have consequences for 
the future of the Union." 
  But legal action alone is not enough he says. "More 
efficient measures could be taken to force Greece to lift the 
embargo. The EU has the means and mechanisms. Since it 
allocates a large amount of funds to support Greece it would be 
logical to expect it to withdraw some of those funds." 
  Neither is he satisfied with the European Court's handling 
of 
the case. The reason for the delay, he believes, is that the 
court is waiting for the end of the Greek presidency of the EU 
on 30 June before making a pronouncement, so as to avoid 
censuring an EU country while it holds the presidency. 
  It is normal for legal processes to take a long time, I 
suggested. "True," he replied. "But we were first told by the 
EU that they expected a concrete decision in two to three weeks. 
It has now been three months. If by the end of June a 
temporary decision is reached on lifting the embargo then we 
will be all right. However, if the court then decides to 
undertake a full legal process it could take two years or more. 
  "Then if the embargo caused the destabilisation of this 
region, what use would it be to us if we were to receive 
compensation or some other help later on?" He said that he had 
been told informally that the court would make its position 
known soon after the end of June. "But if the court process is 
prolonged we will have a situation in which the EW can wash its 
hands and say it did all it could in this matter." 
  With industries being forced to close and living standards 
plummetting, the burden which ordinary people have to bear is 
heavy, he said. 
  "There is a great danger of a rise in social tension, and 
the 
continuation of the present situation with Greece could feed the 
appetites of our other neighbours," he added. "This situation 
does not contribute to the stability and peace of the region." 
  The row with Greece is over four points: the name Macedonia, 
which Greece claims as its own; the flag with the Sun of 
Vergina, the emblem of Philip of Macedonia, Alexander the 
Great's father; the Macedonian constitution, which Greece says 
betrays expansionist aims; and what Greece considers to be 
anti-Greek propaganda. 
  Mediation efforts by Cyrus Vance for the UN, and by the US 
special envoy, Matthew Nimetz, have so far got nowhere. 
Gligorov said: "We are convinced that no settlement can be 
reached unless there is a willingness by both sides to make 
compromises. I believe the embargo cannot be linked with this 
process, and should be lifted immediately. Without the lifting 
of the embargo we will not sign any settlement." 
  If there is no settlement, one unexpected result of the 
Greek 
embargo could be the construction of a combined east-west rail 
and road corridor linking Albania to Turkey, and traversing 
Macedonia and Bulgaria. 
  Paradoxically, the new project would isolate Greece. The 
so-called "east-west corridor" has been placed at the top of the 
European agenda for new communications since Greece declared its 
embargo. 
  Then there are the international sanctions against Serbia, 
with whom Macedonia conducted 57 per cent of its trade. The 
Sanctions Committee of the UN visited Skopje to assess the 
damages of the previous two years and came up with the figure of 
over $3 billion. On top of this has come the Greek embargo. 
  "So far we have succeeded in maintaining our peace and 
stability. But, and I say this with great regret, despite all 
the sympathy and the moral support we have been getting from the 
EU, we have received no substantial financial support which 
would enable us to be more calm until the situation improves." 
  And how much had his country received from the EU since the 
current Greek embargo began? "Nothing," he replied. It was the 
only word he uttered in English.

  [Text] Skopje, 19 May (TANJUG) -- "My visit to Macedonia, 
in the company of French General de Laprsle, UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] commander for former Yugoslavia, is aimed at 
gaining a first-hand insight into the country's internal and 
external stability," head of UNPROFOR's mission in former 
Yugoslavia, Japanese diplomat Yasushi Akashi, said this 
afternoon. 
  We had a very fruitful discussion with President Kiro 
Gligorov and Defense Minister Vlado Popovski. We wished to hear 
their opinions, which will also help the United Nations 
determine future moves -- especially as regards the stability of 
borders and the improvement of economic and political stability, 
Akashi said. 
  I discovered, unfortunately, that Macedonia was in an 
unenviable economic situation due to its strict adherence to the 
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, and because of the 
embargo imposed by Greece against Macedonia. I will convey 
President Gligorov's message to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. President Gligorov has suggested that the 
Greek-Macedonian dispute be examined by the UN Security Council. 
Akashi particularly stressed that the talks provided an 
opportunity for a thorough analysis of the situation along 
Macedonia's borders -- especially the sections monitored by 
UNPROFOR. 
  Akashi also met UNPROFOR representatives in Macedonia in the 
course of his one-day visit.

  [Text] A new Hungarian interest protection organization is 
to be formed in Vojvodina, Arpad Madarasz reports from Ujvidek 
[Novi Sad]: 
  [Madarasz] According to the initiators, following the 
General 
Assembly of the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina 
[VMDK] in Zenta [at the end of March] it became clear that the 
Hungarians of Vojvodina were left without an organization to 
protect their interests. 
  To remind you, this was the General Assembly which was 
convened to clarify the financial involvement of Sandor Hodi, 
the organization's deputy chairman, in the matter of receiving 
money from the Illyes Foundation, and where, at least seemingly, 
the wing led by [VMDK Chairman] Andras Agoston won the upper 
hand. 
  According to a communique published in MAGYAR SZO of 
Ujvidek, 
the founding members of the new organization pledge to represent 
the real interests of Hungarians in Vojvodina. Their priority 
task is to unite the Hungarians in Vojvodina and to create the 
conditions for them to remain there. One of the participants in 
the founding session, Sandor Egresi, told the Ujvidek newspaper 
that there is a need for an interest protection organization 
which is not exclusive and which allows for different opinions. 
  Among the members of the founding committee are hitherto 
VMDK 
leadership members and present and former parliamentary deputies 
such as Dr. Sandor Hodi, (Ferenc Csubela), and Dr. Zoltan Varga. 
They intend to hold the organization's founding session within a 
month.

  [Text] London, May 19 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic on Thursday rejected a statement by 
British Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg that the 
Moslems in the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should 
admit a military defeat. Speaking to BBC's reporter in 
Sarajevo, Silajdzic firmly rejected claims that the Moslems had 
lost the war in Bosnia and said that the main reason for their 
losses so far is the international embargo on arms deliveries. 
The United Nations banned the delivery of weapons to the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia in September 1991. 
  Addressing the Royal Institute in London on Wednesday Hogg 
said that the peace process in Bosnia would begin only if the 
Serbs give up a part of the territories and the Moslems admit 
military defeat. The Moslems must be reconcilled with this and 
realize that a foreign military intervention in Bosnia is out of 
the question, he said. Hogg warned the warring sides in Bosnia 
that in the next eight weeks a peace agreement should be reached 
because the alternative is the withdrawal of the U.N. 
peacekeepers and the halting of international humanitarian aid. 
The pullout of the international troops from Bosnia could 
seriously be considered if the Moslems continue nurturing hopes 
that the embargo on arms deliveries could be lifted, as the 
United States promised in the face of British and French 
opposition, Hogg said. 
  The Moslem government in Sarajevo rejects a four-month 
ceasefire called for by the meeting of foreign minsiters of 
Russia, the United States, European Union and the United Nations 
held in Geneva last Friday. Hogg recalled that early this year 
Great Britain and France announced they would not forever keep 
their troops in Bosnia and had started looking for ways to 
withdraw them. According to Hogg, this was cut short by NATO's 
military scenario and the U.S. diplomatic initative for 
supporting the Sarajevo Moslem authorities. 
  British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Wednesday 
that so far there does not exist a plan for the withdrawal of 
the British U.N. contingent from Bosnia.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 19 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the republic of Srpska's national assembly, has 
said that the Bosnian Serbs have pointed to the shortcomings of 
the contact group for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "However, it 
failed to seriously convey all the remarks we had voiced during 
the last talks in Pale," Krajisnik said in a statement for 
TANJUG prior to the beginning of the Bosnia contact group's 
two-day work in Washington. 
  Our first remark, Krajisnik went on, is that the Serbs 
cannot 
take part in the continuation of the conference without 
receiving equal treatment, meaning that the sanctions should be 
lifted and that the pressure now being exerted on the Serbs 
should end. "The second thing concerns territorial demands put 
to the Serbs so the Muslims could get 51 percent of the 
territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina--this was demanded of 
us without explanation and was not backed by any arguments," 
Krajisnik said and expressed hope that the contact group will 
acknowledge these remarks on the basis of new information at its 
disposal, and find an acceptable solution. "True, there will be 
problems with the territories because our remarks will be 
construed as a condition for continuing the talks--which would 
be a mistake because we are not setting any conditions for the 
cessation of hostilities and the continuation of the conference. 
Hope lies in negotiations, but we cannot allow ourselves to be 
under pressure while the Muslims and Croats are not, and this 
only makes the continuation of the talks more difficult," 
Krajisnik added. 
  Commenting on reports of a new international conference on 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said that thorough 
preparations must be carried out ahead of such a meeting, and 
certain dilemmas must be settled because which part of Bosnia 
belongs to one or the other side is not immaterial. 
  What is good and provides a good basis for talks is the fact 
that the stance has finally been agreed that Bosnia must finally 
be divided into two parts. Attempts to create obstacles to 
division by calling for a unified Bosnia, and by linking its 
parts either into a federation, a confederation, or a union--all 
these things are, in fact, attempts to turn back the clock, 
although it is clear that it cannot be turned back, Krajisnik 
said. In his opinion, the most important problem has been 
resolved and that is that Bosnia must be divided into two parts, 
while the West has resolved the problem of what it will do with 
the Muslims. 
  Speaking about the current Muslim offensive, the National 
Assembly speaker expressed his disappointment with the role of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] because, he said, "we have 
noticed bias on the part of the peacekeeping forces." Not only 
do they tolerate the Muslim offensive, but they fail to react at 
all to their offensive actions, hoping that the Muslims will 
improve their position, and that this will be a good basis for 
the continuation of negotiations. We must accept and 
realize--and this is the most difficult thing in this war--that 
there is no justice for the Serb people either, because we are 
an obstacle to the realization of major interests, but we must 
hold out because we have a great chance of achieving our goals, 
although the road to accomplishing this will be difficult, 
Krajisnik said. 
  Momcilo Krajisnik also hinted at a new session of the 
republic of Srpska's parliament, most probably next Tuesday or 
Wednesday [24th or 25th May]. Owing to large-scale diplomatic 
preparations for the upcoming international conference on 
Bosnia, the assembly session--instead of being held this 
week--has been postponed until the beginning of next week, 
Momcilo Krajisnik, concluded in a statement he made to TANJUG 
today.

Tells AL-HAYAH: Expect Tangible Change; We will Not Allow More 
Concessions To Be Imposed on us"] 
  [Excerpts] Jeddah, Zagreb -- Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic arrived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at dawn 
yesterday, Wednesday, to perform pilgrimage. He is accompanied 
by 500 citizens, including some war wounded and handicapped. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Bosnian president spoke about tangible progress in the 
Bosnians' defense of their rights. He said: "You will see a 
change in the coming days." 
  Izetbegovic announced his country's total rejection of 
occupied Brcko's inclusion in the safe areas. He said: "Brcko 
has a Muslim majority and this will continue to be the case. If 
it is not possible to retrieve it peacefully, we will work to do 
so by force of arms." He added that declaring it a safe area 
perpetuates the Serb occupation, which controls half of it. 
  On the recent peace initiative, he stated sternly that "the 
international community cannot put further pressures on us, as 
we have offered sufficient concessions. We now believe that the 
shape of our future relies on our strength, God's help, and the 
support of our friends throughout the world, especially the 
Islamic world." 
  Asked about the Bosnian Army's ability to liberate the Brcko 
area, he told AL-HAYAH: "I can now confirm that I am certain 
that we are capable of doing that, that the successes achieved 
by the Bosnian Army in recent days prove it, and that conditions 
are now different from past conditions." 
  He announced his opposition to lifting economic sanctions on 
Serbia, even it accepts the new peace initiative. He said: 
"The real boycott is imposed on us through the arms embargo on 
us. Nevertheless, we have stood fast and begun to break the 
shackles, and you will see a tangible change in the coming days." 
  On the contradiction between the powers to be exercised by 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina president and the federal union 
[al-ittihad al-fidrali] president, which will be held by a 
Croat, he said: "I am the president of all unified and 
internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. The federal 
state is part of this state." 
  The Bosnian president warned about the Serb forces' 
increasing violation of the fragile cease-fire agreement in and 
around Sarajevo. He added that the Serbs are exploiting 
international laxity to seize more Muslim territory in Bosnia, 
especially in central and north Bosnia. They are currently 
planning to initiate battles to seize Tuzla, as the day before 
yesterday Serb forces shelled the city of Kladanj, which is 
situated between Sarajevo and Tuzla to the north. 
  Izetbegovic belittled the importance of the new European 
initiative, warning of overoptimism, as "the Serbs have 
persisted in breaking their promises as a result of Europe's 
sympathy with them." He appealed to the Islamic states to offer 
more material support and exert diplomatic efforts to try to 
lift the "arms embargo imposed on Muslims, in order to enable 
them to defend themselves." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [by Pascal Barollier] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, May 19 (AFP) -- Bosnia's Moslem-led 
army has stepped up offensives on several fronts, UN officials 
said Thursday [19 May], as Western governments issued fresh 
warningins that they will pull their peacekeepers out of Bosnia 
unless serious peace negotiations resume. UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] spokesman Rob Annink said the Bosnian Army was 
strengthening its positions on both the eastern and western 
fronts in central Bosnia and "feels ready to launch an attack" 
against Serb forces. He said the heaviest fighting Thursday was 
around Brgule, Olovo and Kladanj, towns located between Sarajevo 
and the northern city of Tuzla, where UN military observers 
counted up to 200 explosions Wednesday. 
  The UNPROFOR has not been allowed to visit the combat zone, 
Annink said. He said the larger Bosnian Army has an advantage 
over the Serbs along the eastern front because the hilly terrain 
favors ground troops over the Serbs' stronger artillery. "The 
Bosnian Army is an infantry army while the Bosnian Serbs have 
mostly artillery," Annink said. He said the army would have a 
tougher time along the western front where the Serbs control the 
high ground overlooking the town of Turbe. But, he added, the 
army has managed to concentrate its troops in the region thanks 
to the federation plan signed in February between the country's 
Moslems and their former Bosnian Croat enemies. The pact has 
allowed the government army to redeploy troops from previous 
zones of conflict with the Croats. 
  The upsurge in fighting came as Britain and Spain joined 
France in raising the possibility they will pull their 
peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia in the absence of progress 
toward peace. 
  British Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg said 
the Bosnian Moslems "have to recognize military defeat when it 
stares them in the face... 
  "I recognize this is extraordinarily unpalatable," he told a 
private group Wednesday night in remarks reported Thursday. 
"Time is running out," he said. "We have eight weeks or so" to 
see positive developments in the peace process. A Foreign 
Office spokesman stressed that Hogg was not referring to a 
withdrawal of troops within any set time limit. 
  Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas meanwhile said 
in Madrid that it was "probable in the coming months we may 
consider reducing our troops in Bosnia... The UN peacekeepers 
cannot stay on a mission forever." 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday that 
France "cannot leave our UN peacekeepers indefinitely (in 
Bosnia) if the people they are trying to help have governments 
that don't want peace." Juppe said Thursday in Paris that the 
foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five Western 
European countries may hold a meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina June 
13. He said the meeting may be decisive in terms of future 
French policy in Bosnia. France has warned in recent days that 
it would consider pulling out its 6,800 troops stationed in the 
former Yugoslavia unless there was a breakthrough in the peace 
process within six months. Britain has about 3,000 troops 
stationed in ex-Yugoslavia while Spain has 1,487. [passage

  [Text] Belgrade, May 19 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces on 
Thursday morning followed strong artillery fire with major 
infantry attacks on Serb positions west of Brcko (northeast 
Bosnia), but were repelled by the Bosnian Serb Army, the Bosnian 
Serb Army Press Centre in Brcko said on Thursday. On Wednesday 
evening the Moslems launched another offensive in Brcko by 
opening mortar fire on Serb positions five km to the west of 
this town. Intensive Moslem massing of forces has also been 
reported in the Sava River valley where the Moslems are bringing 
reinforcements from the region of Tuzla, Moslem-controlled town 
south of Brcko. 
  According to Bosnian Serb sources, two brigades of the First 
Moslem Army Corps have been transferred from the Sarajevo area. 
The Moslems continue violating the ceasefire agreement in the 
region of Sarajevo by opening strong sniper fire on the Serb 
settlements of Ilidza and Grbavica and the Local Rehabilitation 
Institute, the Bosnian Serb Army said. 
  Along the entire front line close to Orasje, Bosnian Croat 
forces (HVO) on Wednesday opened infantry and artillery fire on 
Serb positions. Troop movements towards Serb positions were 
also recorded on the left bank of the Sava in the territory of 
Croatia, as reported by U.N. monitors stationed in Brcko, the 
Bosnian Serb Army sources said. 
  A general artillery and infantry attack launched by the 
Moslems on Wednesday along the Serb defence lines on Mt. Vlasic 
(central Bosnia) continued on Thursday, TANJUG reported from 
Zvornik citing Bosnian Serb Army sources.

<F P=106> [By Bernard Estrade] </F>
  [Excerpts] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 19 (AFP) -- A UN 
plane made two safe flights in and out of Tuzla airport Thursday 
[19 May], flying the first humanitarian mission to the northern 
Moslem enclave since the reopening of the airport in March, UN 
officials said. NATO stepped up air cover of the airport, with 
an AC-130 Spectre hovering above the airport in the morning and 
several fighter planes flying over at low altitude, particularly 
during unloading of the white Ilyushin 76 transport plane. It 
landed two days after Bosnian Serb artillery shelled the airport 
when another UN plane landed there, UN spokesmen said. [passage 
omitted] 
  The first plane Thursday brought in material and equipment 
-- 
including radar -- for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in 
Tuzla, a UN-declared safe area. On its second trip out of Tuzla 
the plane evacuated five people needing medical treatment, 
accompanied by nine members of their families, on behalf of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was the first 
time since the solemn reopening of the airport by special UN 
envoy Yasushi Akashi that a UN humanitarian mission has taken 
place at the airport. UNHCR spokeswoman Radna Vikoren said the 
agency hoped "security conditions will allow the airport to be 
used again." 
  A third flight was expected to take place later in the day. 
[passage omitted] The United Nations said there were no 
problems Thursday and no Serb artillery fire when the Ilyushin 
76 made two successful trips in and out of the airport, on a 
circuit from Split to Tuzla to the Croatian capital Zagreb then 
again through Tuzla before heading back to Split. The mainly 
Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the 
UNPROFOR on March 22. Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for 
UN forces stationed here landed at the airport through April 14, 
but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.

  [Text] Bratislava--A new objection to the budget of the 
Ministry of Education has emerged in the ethnically mixed 
territories. Under the ministry's pedagogical and 
organizational instructions and teaching curriculums, an extra 
one to two hours of Slovak language and conversation [per week] 
are to be added in schools with a non-Slovak language of 
instruction. Moreover, preference is to be given to the 
division of classes during Slovak language lessons. Lubomir 
Harach, minister of education and science, informed us that the 
ministry has released from its budget a reserve of 100 million 
korunas to secure education [in the Slovak language] in the 
ethnically mixed territories.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Karol Wolf: "Slovak Hungarians Are Looking </F>
Across the Danube"] 
  [Text] It is no secret that shifts on the Hungarian 
political scene tend to be carried over to the countries 
inhabited by Hungarian minorities. This holds even more true 
for Slovakia, with its politically differentiated Hungarian 
minority. 
  The electoral defeat suffered by the ruling Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] will find its expression in Slovakia in 
the loss of influence of Miklos Duray, chairman of the 
Coexistence movement, who directly participated in the MDF's 
election campaign. Both the chief of the victorious Socialists, 
Gyula Horn, and the leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
Gabor Kuncze, do not conceal their distaste for Duray's 
positions. Horn even used the word "dummy" [hlupak] when 
referring to Duray during his last visit to Slovakia before the 
elections. 
  The second Hungarian political party in Slovakia, the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], will probably 
retain its former standing after the change of power in Hungary 
and will continue to strive for the integration of all Hungarian 
ethnic parties. 
  The chances of the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS], which is not 
represented in the present parliament, have improved. It is a 
member of the Liberal International and a direct partner of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which will probably 
participate in the new government in Budapest. Similar to the 
MKDH, the MOS pursues as its basic political goals the formation 
of a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition and the weakening 
of the influence of Coexistence. 
  However, the Socialists' victory in Hungary offers yet 
another alternative concerning the political evolution of the 
Hungarian minority in Slovakia. It is no secret that the Party 
of the Democratic Left [SDL], which does not conceal its joy 
over the success of its colleagues on the other side of the 
Danube, has long been trying to gain broader support in the 
south of the country. Compared with other political parties, the 
SDL is purposefully building its structures there, and, today, 
when SDL Chairman Peter Weiss can boast of his friendship with 
Horn, its chances are growing bigger. The Hungarians in 
southern Slovakia wish calm and peace, which is exactly what the 
Weiss-Horn duo offers. 
  The political evolution of the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia 
thus offers two alternatives. The propaganda of Horn's 
Socialists can help the SDL, which will most probably open its 
ticket for ethnic Hungarian candidates. The second alternative 
is that, with the MOS's entry into the Hungarian coalition, more 
liberal ideas will appear in the policy of this minority, and 
right-wing currents will come to prevail in it. In view of the 
permanently proreform attitudes demonstrated by Slovak 
Hungarians in sociological surveys, the second alternative is 
more likely. It needs to be said, however, that both 
alternatives bear in themselves the potential to introduce 
greater calm into the Slovak-Hungarian dialogue.

<F P=106> [Article by Emil Bajanek: "First Slovak; A New Pistol for </F>
the Slovak Army"] 
  [Text] In the second half of the year, the range of 
short-barreled small arms on our market will be extended with a 
9-mm pistol, the model PS 93 Parabellum, manufactured by the 
Povazske Strojarne [Vah Valley Engineering Works] a.s. at 
Povazska Bystrica. This individual automatic weapon is intended 
for firing at targets within a range of 50 meters, but it can be 
used for firing at more distant targets, as well. The pistol 
has a 15-cartridge magazine. 
  Engineer Dusan Melioris, director of the Povazske Strojarne 
Research Institute, says that this top-quality product builds on 
the company's production of small firearms that was discontinued 
in 1954. The Army of the Slovak Republic currently does not 
have a pistol of this caliber in its arsenal. The weapon had 
been developed for sports shooting, particularly for combat 
shooting enthusiasts. The well-balanced pistol is distinguished 
by its extraordinary precision. The most up-to-date technical 
methods have been applied in its design. The pistol has a 
locked breech system [uzamknuty zaverovy system] and the 
automatic repeat function is secured by a short recoil of the 
barrel. The pistol has a push-pull triggering mechanism 
[mechanizmus napinania bicieho kohuta pistole je dvojcinny] and 
is equipped with a manual safety catch, and, after the last 
cartridge has been fired, the breech mechanism becomes locked in 
the rear position, says Melioris. From the head of the Research 
Institute's Technical Department, we have learned that once 
production reaches full capacity, some 300 employees will be 
involved in the implementation of this supplementary production 
program of Povazske Strojarne. He also mentioned that, 
following the federation's partition, the development of the 
pistol was not without certain hitches. 
  Povazske Strojarne will exhibit the pistol model PS 93 
Parabellum in several modifications at the specialized IDET 
[expansion unknown] exhibition in Brno at the beginning of June. 
In cooperation with the Syndicate of Slovak Journalists and the 
Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, the manufacturer is 
preparing a demonstration of the weapon on 8 June. The 
demonstration will take place in the Turecky Vrch military 
training compound. 
  During our visit to Povazske Strojarne, our hosts also 
acquainted us with the first Slovak pistols equipped with an 
optical or laser direction finder. The creatively designed 
wood-lined butt attracted our interest because it is perfectly 
adjusted to the anatomy of the hand and is a comfortable fit. 
Povazske Strojarne will also be manufacturing ammunition for 
the pistol. Until recently, local engineers produced some 50 
different types of cartridges.

<F P=106> [Article by "lr": "Investment Funds Heard Out; Wage Growth </F>
in Loss-Making Companies and Banks Will Be Limited to 15 Percent 
This Year"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--Following a six-month delay, wage 
regulation will, after all, become the reality for the state and 
semistate sector as of 1 July, in accordance with the 
recommendation of the International Monetary Fund. This was 
announced by Julius Brocka, minister of labor, social affairs, 
and the family, in the course of yesterday's consultative 
meeting of economic ministers. 
  The aim of wage regulation is not to freeze wages at their 
current level. As Minister Brocka stressed, under the proposed 
limit for wage growth [smerny rast], even companies that will be 
subject to the decree will be able to retain the real value of 
their employees' earnings. This means that, because an overall 
17-percent growth of consumer prices is expected this year, even 
in wage-regulated organizations wages will be permitted to rise 
17 percent. Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova 
specified, however, that the upper limit will be between 15 and 
17 percent, so as to utilize the motivating nature of the 
restriction for labor productivity improvements. In compliance 
with the demands of social partners laid down in the General 
Agreement, the government decree will not apply to organizations 
that operate at a profit. Equally, it will have no impact on 
already transformed entities--that is, entities in which the 
stake of the state and of shareholders from coupon privatization 
is lower than 50 percent as well as entities in which foreign 
capital has an ownership stake in excess of 30 percent. 
  There is one exception, however. Even profitable 
organizations in banking, the energy sector, and the water 
economy will not be permitted to exceed the set limit for wage 
growth because, as Julius Brocka said, the development of wages 
in these branches has broken loose. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland

European Union [EU] assistance to the Czech Republic, was signed 
by Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka and Leopoldo Giunti, 
the EU Commission's emissary to the Czech Republic, in Cernin 
Palace [in Prague] yesterday. 
  The program covers new trends in cooperation between the 
Czech Republic and the EU. The principal change is the PHARE 
shift from only technical assistance to support for specific 
projects, particularly in transportation and the environment. 
Great attention will also be paid to the preparation of Czech 
institutions for future integration into EU structures. 
According to Pavel Bratinka, the key sphere is private 
business, with an emphasis on restructuring industry and 
developing small and medium-size enterprises. Another sphere on 
which PHARE will concentrate is education. The project also 
intends to assist in reinforcing the social net. It is expected 
that a total of 60 million ECU's (approximately 2.04 billion 
korunas) will be spent on new obligations of the PHARE program.

<F P=106> [Report prepared by the Czech Statistical Office Department </F>
of Prices Statistics and Foreign Trade: "Foreign Trade Turnover 
Has Increased in the First Quarter"] 
  [Text] During the first quarter of 1994, the Czech 
Republic's foreign trade generated a surplus balance of trade, 
and the changes in the territorial structure and the structure 
of imports and exports according to the individual categories of 
goods continued. 
  The territorial structure changed, in particular, as a 
consequence of trading with the Slovak Republic, where, during 
the first three months of 1994, the tendency toward a gradual 
decline in mutual trade began to manifest itself. The measures 
adopted by the Slovak Government, which consisted of introducing 
an import surcharge and tightening legislative and technical 
conditions for imports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak 
Republic, were reflected in a reduction in mutual turnover. In 
imports, the proportion of mineral fuels, lubricants, and 
related materials increased, while the proportion of machinery 
and means of transportation declined. In exports, the 
proportion of various finished products increased, while the 
proportion of machinery and means of transportation declined. 
  The overall foreign trade turnover in the first quarter of 
1994, compared with the same period of last year, increased by 
4.8 percent; of this, imports rose by 15.9 percent, but exports 
fell by 4.3 percent. The value of overall imports amounted to 
83.3 billion korunas [Kc] and was Kc11.5 billion higher than in 
the first three months of 1993. The overall value of exports 
amounted to Kc85 billion, which was Kc3.8 billion less. The 
balance of trade ended with a surplus of Kc1.7 billion. 
  From the territorial point of view, states with an advanced 
market economy took a 60.8-percent share in overall foreign 
trade turnover (European Union [EU] states--42.8 percent and 
members of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] 12.3 
percent). The Slovak Republic took a 15.2-percent share, the 
countries of the former Soviet Union 10.3 percent, developing 
countries 7.3 percent, European states with a transitional 
economy (excluding the countries of the former USSR) 5.6 
percent, and states with a state trading system 0.8 percent. 
  In trade with the Slovak Republic, the value of imports in 
the first quarter amounted to Kc12.5 billion, which was Kc2.5 
billion less than in the same period of last year, and the value 
of exports amounted to Kc13.2 billion--that is, Kc6.6 billion 
less. Imports declined to 83.4 percent of the level of the 
first quarter of 1993, and exports declined to 66.5 percent. 
The balance of trade had a surplus of Kc0.7 billion. Ties 
established within the former CSFR, when a substantial part of 
the exchange of goods was accounted for by complementary 
shipments, are still being reflected in the mutual exchange of 
goods. However, they are becoming gradually weaker. In the 
mutual exchange of raw and processed materials and goods, 
industrial goods were predominant, with a 37-percent share of 
overall imports and a 31-percent share of overall exports, while 
machinery and means of transportation had a 20-percent share of 
overall imports and a 26-percent share of overall exports. 
  Imports from states with an advanced market economy in the 
first quarter of 1994, compared with the previous year, rose by 
23.3 percent, and exports to these states rose by 12.2 percent. 
The rise in imports, compared with the same period of last 
year, amounted to Kc9.2 billion, and the rise in exports 
amounted to Kc5.9 billion. The balance of trade had a surplus of 
Kc5.2 billion. The trade surplus with EU countries amounted to 
Kc4.4 billion and with the EFTA member states to Kc1.3 billion. 
The most important trading partner from these countries was the 
Federal Republic of Germany, with a 26.1-percent share of the 
Czech Republic's overall foreign trade turnover. It was 
followed by Austria (8.6 percent) and Italy (4.8 percent). In 
imports from states with an advanced market economy, machinery 
and means of transportation were predominant (42 percent of all 
of the goods and materials imported); in exports, industrial 
goods were predominant, with a 30-percent share of overall 
exports. Czech trade with OECD states flourished; imports from 
these countries during the first quarter amounted to Kc48.6 
billion, and, compared with the same period of last year, had 
increased by 23 percent; exports amounted to Kc54.9 billion and 
had increased by 13.8 percent. The balance of trade had a 
deficit of Kc6.3 billion. 
  Imports from developing countries increased by 28.4 percent, 
and, compared with the first three months of 1993, exports to 
these regions increased by 28.8 percent; the balance of trade 
ended with a surplus of Kc3.4 billion. Machinery and means of 
transportation accounted for 37 percent of imports, and 
foodstuffs and live animals accounted for 32 percent. 
Industrial goods accounted for 59 percent of exports and 
machinery, and means of transportation accounted for 29 percent. 
The so-called Asian Tigers--Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, 
Singapore, and Malaysia--have become interesting trading 
partners. These countries had only a 4.4-percent share of 
overall Czech foreign trade turnover, but the exchange of goods 
with them is increasing dynamically; imports rose by 44.3 
percent and exports by 71.4 percent. 
  In trade with the European states with a transitional 
economy, excluding the former Soviet Union, imports rose by 32.7 
percent and exports declined by 10.5 percent. The balance of 
trade achieved a surplus of Kc0.6 billion. The largest trading 
partner from this group was Poland, with a 2.9-percent share of 
overall foreign trade turnover; it was followed by Hungary, 
whose share amounted to 1.5 percent. Industrial goods, with a 
32-percent share of overall exports, and machinery and means of 
transportation, with a 21-percent share, made up the bulk of 
goods exported from the Czech Republic to these countries. 
  The surplus generated in trade with states with a state 
trading system--the DPRK, Laos, China, Cuba, Vietnam, and 
Mongolia--amounted to Kc0.3 billion. The volume of imports from 
these states was 44.2 percent higher than in the first quarter 
of 1993; of course, exports declined to a mere fifth of the 
level during the same period of the previous year. This 
development was a result of the equally large decline in the 
value of exports to China. The dominant items in overall 
imports were various finished products (almost 50 percent); in 
exports, they were machinery and means of transportation (82 
percent). 
  Imports from the former Soviet Union increased by 25.1 
percent; however, exports declined to 80.3 percent of the level 
of the first three months of 1993. The balance of trade deficit 
amounted to Kc8.5 billion. The largest trading partner from 
this group of countries was Russia with a 13.8-percent share of 
overall imports; however, it had only a 3.2-percent share of 
overall exports. In the structure of imports according to the 
categories of goods, imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and 
related materials were predominant because oil and natural gas 
come into this category. The share of this category of goods in 
overall imports was 78 percent. The largest goods category in 
exports was machinery and means of transportation, which had 
more than a 35-percent share of overall exports. 
  In the structure of imports according to the categories of 
goods, in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same 
period of last year, the share of imports of mineral fuels, 
lubricants, and related materials rose by 1.5 points to 15.5 
percent of overall imports. During the first three months of 
1994, 1.7 million tonnes of oil (1.5 million tonnes in the same 
period of the previous year) and 3.1 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas (1.7 billion cubic meters) were imported. The share 
of imports of various finished products increased by 0.9 points 
to 11.1 percent, and the share of chemicals and related products 
increased by 1.6 points to 12.9 percent. The share of imports 
of machinery and means of transportation declined by 3.5 points 
to 30.3 percent, and the share of industrial goods declined by 
1.6 points to 15.7 percent. During the first quarter of 1994, 
compared with the same period of last year, imports in all 
categories of goods increased, apart from the beverages and 
tobacco categories. 
  The structure of exports according to the categories of 
goods 
in the first three months of 1994 was, compared with the same 
period of last year, characterized by an increase in the share 
of exports of various finished products by 3.0 points to 15.2 
percent of overall exports. On the other hand, the share of 
exports of machinery and means of transportation declined by 2.4 
points to 23.7 percent. The share of exports of the most 
significant items, 31.8 percent of which were accounted for by 
industrial goods, declined slightly. Compared with the first 
three months of 1993, exports in all categories declined, with 
the exception of the raw-materials category, excluding fuels and 
raw materials for the food industry and the various finished 
goods category.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Kulin, head of the parliamentary </F>
group and deputy chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by 
Tibor J. Keri; place and date not given: "The MDF's Tone Did 
Not Prove To Be Expedient"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Keri] According to the 
election results, the whole society has rejected your party, 
when the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] won the first round everywhere.... 
  [Kulin] You should not say more than the figures show, and 
the figures show that almost 70 percent of the citizens 
participated in the vote, including more than 30 percent who 
voted in favor of the MSZP. This shows that our society is 
equally divided into socialist, liberal, and national trends. 
  [Keri] In your opinion, what did the MDF do wrong in the 
past four years? 
  [Kulin] The reasons for the defeat of the MDF and of the 
coalition are not subjective. The process of change in the 
regime in the whole region is taking place much more slowly and 
with more conflicts than society expected. It is almost an 
automatic development that the parties carrying out the change 
in the regime in our region lose the elections. 
  [Keri] The MDF and the government have often been accused of 
arrogance, haughtiness, "mission-awareness," and lack of 
sensitivity in the past years. 
  [Kulin] These accusations of arrogance and loftiness were 
created by the mass media. However, I admit that the MDF 
leaders were crude to the press and some intellectual circles 
from the very beginning, but not with society and the common 
people. Therefore, it is not true that the government led by 
the late Jozsef Antall disregarded the people or the citizens. 
It is, however, true that the MDF turned its back and became 
rude to those who wrote and spoke of the MDF with hatred even 
before the 1990 elections. The accusations of arrogance 
originate from this circle of journalists, and some Hungarian 
intellectuals picked up this accusation, people who had lost 
their public offices in the wake of the change in the regime. I 
would look for the mistakes somewhere else. The tone with which 
we addressed the society did not prove to be expedient. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Keri] In your view, did the negative television campaign 
against the MSZP chairman influence voters? Did the dismissals 
carried out in the Hungarian Radio have any effect on the 
election results? 
  [Kulin] I am very curious to know, but I cannot judge this. 
I would welcome a thorough and objective opinion poll about 
these issues. My personal experiences are controversial: A 
similar number of people agreed with those dismissals and said 
that it harmed the MDF. As for the MSZP and its chairman, Gyula 
Horn, he must be aware that his name and his past symbolize 
forces that constantly led to conflicts in Hungarian political 
life. 
  [Keri] In your view, what can we expect from the Hungarian 
Radio and Hungarian Television after the elections? What can 
the heads of News, Panorama, or Sunday News expect, programs 
that the public regards as too ardently pro-government? 
  [Kulin] I firmly believe that a new phase of the media war 
is beginning now. Obviously, the political forces which now 
have the right to make personnel decisions will reorganize the 
leadership of these two institutions in accordance with their 
taste and will. 
  [Keri] The present government also formed the media 
according to its own image.... 
  [Kulin] No, it failed to do so. The ideas and the balance 
of intellectual forces that emerged in the past 40 years have 
such a preponderance in the media that the changes that 
pro-government leaders could make were only the tip of the 
iceberg. The News, Panorama, and other programs can only be 
regarded as the tip of the iceberg. 
  [Keri] Will there be scapegoats for the expected election 
defeat of the MDF? Do you think that you might be such a 
scapegoat, since you were the one who worked out the party's 
program? 
  [Kulin] I do not think so because I do not believe that the 
program decided the fate of the party. I believe, of course, 
that an analysis of responsibility, including personal 
responsibility, will take place in the party. Nor do I think 
that the defeat could lead to a split in the party. It is 
possible, however, that, after the establishment of the new 
parliament, the leading bodies of the MDF will offer the 
possibility of personnel changes at the national meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by LE FIGARO reporter </F>
Jean Mirot; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Mirot] Thank you, Mr. President, for granting me 
some moments of your precious time. It was very important for 
LE FIGARO to interview you before you arrived in Paris, to 
discuss a number of topical issues with you. I am very 
impressed that you have accepted -- which to my mind is a sign 
of confidence -- that this interview should take place in the 
form of a conversation, which will be more interesting for our 
readers than mere answers often formulated in formal and dull 
words. So, once more, I feel very honored and, at the same 
time, also much indebted to you. Of course, I would like to ask 
you some questions. I think that they have already sent you a 
list of them. 
  My first question refers to a question that crops up in the 
heads of the French people, who saw the Romanian revolution from 
a great distance and got a tragic impression, and who today 
wonder whether it was actually a real revolution and not merely 
a case of certain people changing offices. 
  I will entrust you with a personal experience: I have not 
been to Romania since 1986; yesterday I had the occasion to meet 
with some fellow journalists and I have to tell you that the 
image that I gained about the freedom of press here, to my mind, 
represents the sign of a genuine democracy; that is what it all 
boils down to. However, it is also true that, in the eyes of the 
French, Romania to a certain extent continues to be an enigma. 
Has a revolution taken place? Could the former communist 
leaders really become today's democrats? 
  [Iliescu] What is revolution? It means a radical change in 
social life. Here we should not advance subjective judgments, 
but rather look at the facts as they are and make an objective 
analysis of the real facts. 
  I believe that there are two fundamental elements that 
determine whether or not a movement is a revolution. First, the 
participation of the population in bringing about the change. 
In Romania, it was a genuine popular movement, it was a popular 
explosion. Of course, one can discuss the violent nature of the 
Romanian revolution as compared with all the changes that 
occurred in the other countries in Eastern Europe. What was the 
origin of its violent nature? This was determined by the very 
nature of the regime, of the old system, which made it 
impossible to discuss even a few possible changes, as was the 
case in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev and his "perestroyka." 
To what extent "perestroyka" really led to changes is a 
different matter. But many changes occurred all over Europe and 
even in the Soviet Union. However, those were changes confined 
to the system. 
  In Hungary they begin to prepare the changes while still 
under the Soviet occupation. During the Kadar regime there was 
an opening toward a market economy. In Czechoslovakia there was 
an inner process for a generally more balanced society, because 
that was one of the most developed countries in that part of 
Europe and, before the war, anywhere in Europe. This was so 
because Czechia used to be the industrial center of the former 
Austro-Hungarian Empire and between the two world wars in terms 
of its general economic and industrial level Czechoslovakia was 
ahead of France, Belgium, and Germany. This conferred a certain 
kind of balance to its development even under the communist 
regime, and it also led to the Czechoslovak revolution, defined 
as the "velvet revolution." 
  In Romania such a thing was not possible. There used to be 
an extremely rigid system, which made any changes from the 
inside impossible, and which accumulated very grave tensions in 
the economy, social life, and in one's ability to express 
oneself. You said that you last visited Romania in 1986. You 
know very well that the people used to be suffocated. There was 
no way in which they could freely express themselves. What a 
pity, because in the 1960's Romania had been among the vanguard. 
The first step came in 1958 with the pullout of the Soviet 
troops. I believe that it was a success of the then political 
leadership of Romania, which in subsequent years created the 
alteration in the political orientation of the country. 
  In the years of 1963-1964 the well known dispute took place 
between Romania and the Soviet Union in connection with 
Khrushchev's plan to integrate the economies of the satellite 
countries within the economy of the USSR. In 1964 an official 
declaration was issued against such dominating tendencies of the 
USSR. Thus, all these things contributed to certain alterations 
in the political thinking and, generally speaking, in the 
political climate in our country. During this period the release 
of all political prisoners took place, as well as an 
intellectual and cultural opening up, an opening up toward 
Western Europe, and an opening up in technology, achieved 
through numerous accords and acts of scientific, technological, 
and industrial cooperation. They began with Renault, then with 
Citroen, and then the helicopters. There was a certain kind of 
penetration of modern technology and numerous attempts were made 
to modernize the economy. 
  In 1967 a discussion even took place related to the need 
for our orientation toward the market economy within the 
framework of a "socialist-type" economy, as they used to term it 
in those days. But a fundamental discussion did take place in 
connection with this issue. At that time it was solely the 
Romanians and the Czechs who were openly discussing the 
objective need for changing the way in which the national 
economy was being run. There were discussions on issues 
connected with modern management. In economics and social life 
a special school was set up to train management. Informatics 
was being promoted, Romania being among the vanguard in that 
trend. Cooperation was initiated with the French for the 
production of Romanian-made Felix-type computers, the first of 
this type of computer, and for the assimilation, in general 
terms, of this kind of technology. All this means that there 
was an opening up in the 1960's, which Ceausescu managed to 
crush after 1971 and especially in the 1980's. Thus, it was the 
harsh nature of this regime that determined the change in 
Romania, with its violent popular explosion as a consequence of 
the very grave internal tensions within society, to which one 
can add the influence of the movements that had already begun in 
neighboring countries. This is one of the distinctive features. 
  Here is the second: A popular movement could have taken 
place, it is true, without bringing about any changes 
whatsoever, as you said. A few individuals could have taken 
over the leadership of the country and everything would have 
stayed the same. But is this the case here? An objective 
analysis, rather than a subjective one, has to be done of what 
has happened in Romania over the past four years. One can also 
assess these things by relating to the manifesto of the Romanian 
revolution, to the 10 points of the Proclamation that I read out 
on television in front of the entire society, and which found 
unanimous support. One would find that all those points have 
been put into practice and have been included in the new 
Constitution of the country. In everyday life, as you said, 
there is total liberation, freedom of expression, organization, 
and assembly, new parties have emerged, and there is the idea of 
the multi-party system, in which our political life, generally, 
has been conceived. We even have 200 registered parties. Over 
90 parties... [punctuation as published] 
  [Mirot] This is an aspect pertaining to the Latin character: 
Like France, politics is also considered a sport and an art. 
  [Iliescu] But it is also an objective aspect. After quite a 
long period of suffocation, people wanted to manifest their 
diversity. I consider this an objective phenomenon. It is a 
natural reaction. Human society is an entity consisting of 
diversity, even personal ones; there are about 6 billion of us 
living on this planet, that is, about 6 billion different 
personalities. To suffocate them is stupidity. Therefore, the 
normal reaction of the people was to express this diversity of 
theirs -- hence the explosion in the number of parties and 
newspapers. 
  [Mirot] Exactly as in France after its liberation. 
  [Iliescu] It is a general phenomenon. After this, I believe 
we took very great steps toward structuring a law-governed 
state. Immediately after the revolution, within the first month, 
there were already 30 parties. We set up a kind of a 
provisional parliament, the Provisional National Unity Council 
[CPUN]. We discussed and passed an electoral law, which also 
included certain constitutional principles, because we had 
abolished the old constitution. Then, in May 1990, the first 
elections took place for Parliament, which also had the role of 
a constituent assembly. 
  Our first task was the drafting of a constitution. A modern 
and democratic constitution was devised. This was a democratic 
process in itself, as it was done on the basis of general 
consultations -- we organized a commission of deputies, 
senators, and experts in constitutional law; three months' work 
was spent just on research on our national experience, studying 
all the constitutions that we ever had, contemporary 
legislation, and the most characteristic, the most significant 
constitutions existing in the world; a great number of 
discussions and consultations with experts took place; in 
Bucharest they organized an international seminar on current 
tendencies in the domain of constitutional rights. On this 
basis the first draft of the constitution was drawn up. It was 
then published and discussed for two months; following this, 
over four months, Parliament discussed it point by point, 
article by article, and about 1,000 amendments were made. A new 
draft was then drawn up, which incorporated all these 
amendments. This again was followed by two and a half months of 
debates, discussing even details of the way in which it was 
formulated. This was followed by a vote and a nation- wide 
referendum for the adoption of the Constitution. All this means 
that we have a Constitution that is the expression of a 
democratic process and that expresses, by its contents, our 
lining up with the most modern tendencies in the life of 
democratic states. On the basis of this Constitution local and 
national elections were held in 1992. 
  This means that we have gone through a number of radical 
changes in the last four years and have restructured the state 
in all its components, proceeding from the principle of the 
separation of powers in the state. In this respect, we set up 
new institutions on the basis of the new Constitution. This has 
been done on the political plane. 
  On the economic plane, an instinctive tendency to destroy 
the 
centralized state system that coordinated the entire national 
economy has been manifest. The first months were characterized 
by a general dismantling of these centralized structures, 
something that obviously had negative consequences as well, 
since major disruptions occurred everywhere, which cost us quit 
a lot. However, that was a reaction to the very centralized 
system of our national economy. A decisive turn was taken 
toward promoting a profound economic reform and the transition 
from a supercentralized economy, with its own structures, 
mechanisms, legislation, and institutional forms, to a market 
economy. However, the economy and economic system contain 
greater inertia than the political system and this is the most 
difficult sphere for all of us. We have made many changes and 
have created a new economic framework. We worked out new 
legislation; I believe that we have more than 150 laws on the 
economic changes. Nevertheless, there are still many things 
still to be done. 
  We took steps to liberalize prices, foreign trade, and trade 
in general. We took steps to promote privatization and 
encouraged investment from abroad. We took steps to liberalize 
the national currency -- total liberalization will follow 
shortly -- but it all takes time. On the other hand, all these 
abrupt changes have led to some very serious internal 
disruptions, to which one should add foreign international 
factors, such as the dismantling of CEMA [Council for mutual 
Economic Assistance] and the disappearance of our traditional 
markets, partners, and sources of energy and raw materials. 
  It is obvious that this has had a directly negative effect, 
particularly on industrial production. We are currently working 
at half capacity in industry. Then there followed the Gulf 
crisis, the embargo against Yugoslavia, and the world and 
European recession, all of which are influencing this process. 
Hence, this decrease in production, to which one should add 
that we were confronted with a very tough drought for three 
years and with the dismantlement of the agricultural cooperative 
farms -- that was another reaction to an objective situation, 
namely the state's brutal interference in the life of the 
cooperative farms, which led to a reaction against them. But 
these structures have nothing to do with communist structures, 
despite the fact that there are even some primitive slogans 
claiming that they are communist structures. 
  Cooperatives have existed for thousands of years in all 
countries with agricultural traditions. The cooperative 
movement is very strong in France, Italy, and other European 
countries. On the other hand, you have the people's normal 
reaction against the cooperatives, which were looked upon as 
state structures. On the other hand, there were political 
forces which made a lot of hullabaloo about this problem of the 
"old structures." However, this cost us, since the cooperatives 
were dismantled. We worked out a Land Law, but we could have 
preserved the extant organizational and management structures. 
You see, there is this confusion between the ownership 
structure and management, that is, the administration of 
agricultural fields. We have abolished all this, with the end 
result that we now have more than 5 million owners of 9 million 
hectares, which means an exaggerated fragmentation of the land, 
with all its implications for the activity in agriculture and 
the possibility of using mechanization, chemicalization, and 
technologies. 
  [Mirot] Please tell us something about the belated process 
of privatization, where it seems that you have made rather slow 
progress. 
  [Iliescu] First of all, let us wind up the first question. 
From a popular point of view, all this was a characteristic 
feature of the Romanian movement and the Romanian revolution. 
As far as changes are concerned, profound modifications took 
place, which transformed the physiognomy of Romanian society. 
Therefore, I believe that the two basic requirements for 
determining the nature of a revolution have been met; any other 
arguments are but slogans, politicking, and political struggle. 
Regarding political maneuvers, Iliescu is a "nobody," since for 
20 years I have been removed from any political decision-taking 
process. I came into conflict with Nicolae Ceausescu in 1971, 
after his visit to Asian countries, particularly Korea. So, 
anything else is nothing but concoction and slogans. 
  When one examines social phenomena, one should look at 
things 
from an objective angle, without hidden political and 
ideological motives and without ideological prejudices in this 
respect. 
  [Mirot] What about the slow pace of privatization, since I 
do not want to call it a failure... 
  [Iliescu] I do not think one can speak of a slow pace. 
There are two aspects involved here: the private sector and 
the privatization of large state-owned companies. 
  I believe a great deal has been done with respect to 
privatization and the sustaining of the private sector. 
Immediately after the revolution, the CPUN passed a law, a 
law-decree, on the sustaining of the private sector of our 
economy. Currently there are half a million various private 
companies, which consist of one individual or one family, or 
they are small or medium-size companies. The opening was made 
especially in commerce. They are criticizing the somewhat 
oriental aspect of the small boutiques, the small booths in 
which things are sold. An explosion is taking place in this 
field. One could also regard it as a historic phenomenon, in 
the sense that capitalism is being rebuilt, and capital is being 
accumulated in the commercial sector; a small-scale initiative 
has manifested itself especially in the domain of commerce and 
services, but at the same time small and even medium-size 
companies have begun to emerge in industry, especially in the 
processing of agricultural products and food. Thus, there are 
currently about 500,000 such enterprises, with over 2 million 
employees, which represents a third of the labor force in our 
economy. So it is a sector that has become quite active and 
important. Currently these enterprises are also very active in 
the domain of exports. 
  But there is a second aspect as well: the privatization of 
the state-owned companies. At the end of the first year after 
the revolution a law was passed on the reorganization of the 
former state-owned companies and two different sectors were 
established: public corporations and commercial companies -- we 
used the French model. The public corporations relate to the 
domain of infrastructure, and I think they will persist there 
for a long time -- in energy, the mining sector, railroads, and 
telecommunications. Then there is the industrial sector, with 
over 6,000 state-owned companies, among which are the great 
enterprises in the iron and steel industry, the oil processing 
industry, and so on. They are organized in the form of 
autonomous commercial companies. They are not led by ministries 
or other central bodies as they used to be; they will be 
subjected to the "great privatization." A law was passed on the 
privatization of those 6,000 companies and on the method that 
should be used to do it. The most difficult problem in the 
selling of those companies is the lack of capital. On the other 
hand, we thought of a kind of a social compensation, as all 
those enterprises have been built over the past 40 years by the 
efforts of the entire nation, of the people. Then Parliament 
included a stipulation in the law that says that 30 percent of 
social capital is to be distributed free among adult citizens 
who are over 18, and so ownership certificates have been 
distributed among all the citizens. Now we are all holders of 
such ownership certificates, which will have to be turned into 
shares as the privatization process goes ahead. 
  Two institutions have been set up: One is the State Property 
Fund, controlled by Parliament, which is managing the remaining 
70 percent of the social capital of those enterprises, and which 
also has to supervise the way in which those enterprises are 
being managed; the second is the Private Property Fund, which is 
managing the ownership certificates and the process of turning 
them into shares. These are the principal institutions dealing 
with the process of privatization. In addition to these, a 
government National Privatization Agency has also been set up, 
which in the beginning took care of the issue of these ownership 
certificates and their distribution among the citizens, and 
organized the first privatization, as a test, in the case of 30 
enterprises, until the State Property Fund was set up, which 
took over from it, and so far it has privatized 450 companies. 
This means that out of those 6,000 enterprises 450 have already 
been privatized. However, as I have already said, the principal 
difficulty is the lack of capital. 
  We are hoping for two things. First, a solution is currently 
being sought to boost the process of turning the ownership 
certificates into shares in the privatization of 2,000 
enterprises. Second, we have the private sector that I already 
mentioned and to a certain extent capital has already 
accumulated there, so people might use it for that purpose. 
  The banking sector has been reorganized. In the old system 
we merely had four commercial banks; under the circumstances of 
a state-planned system, the banking system plays quite a limited 
role. But now, after the explosion of the number of commercial 
and economic companies, banking operations have also expanded; 
currently there are 25 commercial banks and they still cannot 
cope with the demand for banking operations. And there is 
another difficulty, too, namely: the lack of capital of the 
banks on the one hand, and, on the other, the lack of capital of 
the enterprises. The enterprises have to resort to bank loans. 
The banks do not have the necessary resources, which results in 
a hindering, to a certain extent, of the whole process. Our 
case is different from that of Germany, where the eastern 
laender are being economically integrated... 
  [Mirot] With the help of West Germany... 
  [Iliescu] Yes, annually they inject $120 billion into that 
region. We requested a mere $1-billion loan from the Group of 
24; they discussed it for over two years, and finally we were 
granted just half of this. Now we are again holding talks with 
the IMF and the Group of 24. We are holding talks related to 
certain preconditions; over the whole past year there was 
nothing but negotiations. We lack support from abroad. Our 
domestic resources have dropped together with a drop in 
production. Under the all these negative international 
circumstances, our foreign trade has also dropped. Our foreign 
trade has still not managed to become a source of hard currency; 
on the contrary, until now, over the past four years, our 
foreign trade balance has been continuously in the red. This 
means that we lack the necessary hard currency to sustain our 
national currency. The drop in production, the drop in the 
value of our national currency, all of this has acted to fuel 
inflation, and inflation and unemployment are two of the most 
serious social phenomena. 
  [Mirot] Do you have a feeling that Western Europe has tended 
more toward Central Europe while setting you somewhat aside? Do 
you believe that you have really been invited to join the 
European Economic Community, or rather that you are being 
handled a little... 
  [Iliescu] In this connection I believe that everyone is 
dissatisfied, and not just us; even the Czechs are, although 
their situation is the best among all the other countries in the 
transition period -- they have a favorable economic situation, a 
hard currency surplus of $5 billion in their national bank, 
their foreign trade earns about $2 billion to $2.5 billion each 
year, which has created the conditions to have a stable national 
currency and keep inflation under control and unemployment low, 
at about 2-3 percent -- and yet even they are dissatisfied with 
the circumstances under which they have to cooperate with the 
West. 
  The Hungarians and the Poles have no major reasons to be 
dissatisfied, since four years ago their national debt was 
already very large. Meanwhile they have doubled their debt, 
which means that they had access to already open financial 
sources, credits at commercial banks, and so they could double 
their foreign debt. You must remember that two years ago Mr. 
Walesa went on a marathon tour to obtain the rescheduling of 
their debt, and he managed to obtain $8 billion and a certain 
reduction of the debt. 
  Romania has obtained nothing of this kind. So we have 
reasons not to be satisfied. We cannot reproach anyone with 
anything, because in the field of economics there is no such 
thing as human generosity; those are merely phrases used by 
politicians. In economics there is no criteria other than that 
of interest. We do not want disinterested assistance; however, 
we wish a stance of normal partnership, lacking all ideological 
bias, because all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe 
are going through the same process, which is a normal process of 
contemporary society and of our continent. It lies in the 
interest of all European countries that this general integration 
process should be facilitated within the framework of a joint 
process; because now there is not just a crisis among these 
countries. This is a period of general crisis in the European 
economy and the world economy, and owing to this, only 
integration achieved on the basis of a partnership among equals 
can lead to us jointly solving the problems facing all the 
countries. Even the developed countries have their own problems 
-- unemployment, with all its very serious social consequences 
-- but also entirely positive phenomena, that is, technological 
progress. However, technological progress that has very much 
penetrated the service sector has eliminated a great deal of the 
labor force from commerce and services of all kinds. Services 
represented the best alternative and chance for the Western 
European economies after the war. Under the circumstances of 
technological progress, which made many people superfluous in 
agriculture and industry, the third sector [services] 
represented the sole chance; now the third sector has been 
affected. This why even in the case of the developed countries, 
the sole chance is represented by integration, I mean normal 
integration without protectionism, without the arrogant stance 
adopted by the rich with respect to the poor, of the strong with 
respect to the weak, and without ideological bias, but rather by 
establishing the framework for a normal partnership. 
  [Mirot] Before approaching foreign policy, let us exchange a 
few words about domestic policy. According to an IRSOP 
[Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Polling] poll, the 
opposition is rated as having 43 percent support, I believe. 
However, one should not rely too much on opinion polls as they 
are nothing but a snapshot. We could ask ourselves the following 
question: Does this mean that early elections will take place? 
Is this a fact that could persuade you to try and set up a 
coalition government -- recently you had contacts with certain 
parties -- or would you rather continue with the current formula 
until the end of your mandate in 1996? 
  [Iliescu] To my mind both alternatives are acceptable. 
Regardless of the circumstances and the evolution of the balance 
of forces in our society, all governments, regardless of whom 
they consist of, will have to solve the same problems. They are 
problems related to Romania's transition, the continuation of 
the process of strengthening democracy, state structures, the 
efficiency of the state, and, especially, to solve the economic 
problems that currently represent the key issue: the 
restructuring of the economy on the basis of the laws of the 
market and the restructuring of industry in connection with the 
process of privatization. All these are mandatory elements for 
any government. 
  Of course, nuances do exist, and there are differences 
between ways in which these problems can be solved. However, at 
the same time I believe that everything also depends on the 
status of each, of each party and of each person. 
  One has one perspective when one belongs to the opposition 
-- 
it is always easier to criticize and one can always reveal new 
problems, concrete problems. However, the view of the people 
undergoes a fundamental change whenever they change this 
position. From this point of view I would prefer it if a change 
took place. Even after the last elections, in which we did not 
manage to have any party gain a majority in Parliament, I 
addressed an appeal to all the party leaders to find a solution 
or to set up a government of national unity. This was my first 
proposal and it was not advanced for any demagogic purposes. 
  In the current difficult period, because we have lived 
through the harshest years over the past three years, I believe 
in the need for the unity of all political forces and for them 
to assume responsibility. However, my proposal was rejected by 
the leaders of a number of parties. Some of them even said, in 
a cynical way, that during very difficult times it would be 
extremely dangerous for them to assume the responsibility of 
governing. In that case they would be better advised to let 
others assume the responsibility, and, as far as they are 
concerned, perhaps they should wait, criticize, and accumulate 
political capital for the future. I proposed a safe coalition 
in order to have a stable majority. However, owing to the 
circumstances of the period, such a thing proved impossible. 
  I then proposed a political pact, regardless of the 
government's structure, as that may change, in order to achieve 
an agreement on behalf of all the parties, following the example 
of Spain. I even appealed to the party leaders and distributed 
among them the text of the Moncloa Pact, which was a political 
pact concluded among all the political parties represented in 
Spain's Parliament, comprising a rather large array, ranging 
from Fraga Iribarne of the Falangists, to Santiago Carillo, the 
communist leader. It had never even crossed anyone's mind that 
a coalition could be established between the Falangists and the 
Communists. However, they all signed the joint document, which 
was an expression of a national platform and the political 
pledge of all of them to ensure normal development and a normal 
solution to the grave political, economic, and social problems 
that the country was facing. The pact had precisely three 
chapters: a political, an economic, and a social one. 
  I expressed that idea of mine about having to try to 
establish a joint platform. We even began work on a draft for 
such a platform. However, when we began approaching the concrete 
problems, such as the organization of the government, of 
Parliament, and so on, it became impossible to reach an 
agreement. Now we are discussing those issues all over again. 
In December we resumed our negotiations with all the parties 
and also took up that idea again. Currently negotiations are 
taking place among the parties. We will see what happens. 
Anything is possible. They are even talking about early 
elections, although I do not believe that there is much 
enthusiasm in that direction. Everyone is talking about 
elections, but, at the same time, everyone considers that no 
essential changes would occur compared with the current 
situation. 
  [Mirot] For one part of your electorate this would represent 
a risk. 
  [Iliescu] Yes, it would be a risk. But above all, it would 
not be beneficial for the country. The electoral campaign would 
cause time to be wasted and it would generate general social 
tension. From this point of view I believe that our politicians 
are sufficiently realistic; they are talking about early 
elections, but, at the same time, they also express certain 
reserves. 
  The current government is a minority government. This 
represents a difficulty. Thus, the government is compelled to 
negotiate continuously with everyone on each draft law. This 
process also causes tension in Parliament. Discussions are 
taking place without anyone knowing what the final conclusion 
will be. Probably solutions will be found that will be 
extremely difficult to put into practice, but I do not think 
that early elections will be held; not this year, anyway.

head of the Bureau of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 
Zagreb, the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced. 
Their talks focused on the current situation in the UN 
protected areas in Croatia as well as on the implementation of 
the Zagreb cease-fire agreement signed on 29 March. The 
Croatian foreign minister and his guest concluded that 
negotiations between the Croatian Government and the Serbs from 
the UN protected areas should continue as soon as possible. 
  They also discussed the possibilities and conditions for the 
speedy normalization of relations between the Republic of 
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In their talks 
Minister Granic and envoy Knezevic discussed developments in 
former Yugoslavia. In this context it was said that 
negotiations between the Bosnia-Hercegovina federation and the 
Bosnian Serbs should start soon. The Croatian foreign minister 
emphasized that these negotiations and a cease-fire would enable 
talks on a definite territorial and constitutional arrangement 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina to be resumed as soon as possible. 
  Minister Granic also pointed out that searching for a

  [Text] A new proposal to broaden political cooperation 
between the EU [European Union] and Poland has probably been 
brought to Warsaw by EU Commission President Jacques Delors. 
However, he will not reveal the details until tomorrow, after 
ending talks with Polish politicians. 
  [Correspondent] Delors's proposals will be a response to 
earlier suggestions by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. The 
Polish foreign minister sees a possibility of speeding up 
Poland's integration into the EU, particularly in the areas of 
security, foreign policy, and legislation. Delors himself said 
yesterday that he could see our country in the EU by the end of 
the century. He wonders, however, whether the Polish economy 
will stand up to direct confrontation with the West European 
economy. 
  Delors did not want to reveal the details of his proposals 
yet. I have come here to listen to Polish opinions. Our 
cooperation is developing well, nevertheless. We already have 
the association agreement, after all. 
  The EU Commission president admitted, however, that he 
wanted 
primarily to discuss Central European matters in Warsaw. [video

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dejan Lukovic] </F>
  [Text] The behavior and intentions of Vojislav Seselj, 
leader of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], to create his own set 
of values in the order of the political scene of Serbia -- along 
the lines of a holy and infallible inquisition -- both toward 
individuals and institutions, oversteps the limits of true 
endurance and tolerance. Like a genie from the lamp, he 
appeared on the political scene, where -- instead of activism -- 
he has very frequently and deliberately displayed aggression, 
and -- instead of respecting other protagonists in political 
life -- he has practiced the skill of passing judgment without 
evidence. 
  Yesterday's scandal -- that has to be the right word for it 
-- in the FRY Assembly is only a continuation of a string of 
similar acts by Mr. Seselj. Let us remember how he tried to use 
violence against the taxi drivers, how he showed his strength in 
the close encounter with the teachers, and how -- instead of 
presenting arguments -- he told his female colleague, the deputy 
from Montenegro, that she should go to a gigolo club. He has 
been using language devoid of all the basics of decency to keep 
smearing people and vulgarizing the public scene in Serbia, all 
under the guise of political activity, in which the measure of 
truth is only what he says or does. 
  His publicly displayed inclination toward violence or -- to 
be more precise -- toward extreme radicalism, is deeply 
contradictory to democratic and political pluralism, and it 
cannot justify itself through violent confrontation. To accept 
such methods is the limit that, if exceeded, leaves room for no 
surprise, including physical clashes with those who have 
different political views. The behavior of Radical leader Mr. 
Seselj irresistibly reminds one of a mutation of democracy. It 
is no exaggeration to say that, rather frequently, he has 
skillfully combined elements from the political grey area and 
his status of inviolability to leave a large number of ordinary 
people with the feeling of real fear. Never was anything good 
achieved through bad means. Particularly not when the first 
signs of the improvement in the situation in former Yugoslavia 
are to be seen, and when a climate is being created that is not 
favorable to the political options and methods of Mr. Seselj. 
  The leader and some of the SRS deputies can of course 
continue to behave in the manner of smashers of civilized 
dialogue, proposers of the abolition of other political 
organizations and different views. The question is, however, 
whether more indifference and contempt as a moral stand can be 
our alibi for our reluctance to define clearly and decisively 
the pathological in the political and everyday life. The later 
it is done, the higher the price to be paid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Xavier Gautier in Paris; date not given: "We Will Abolish The 
Border"] 
  [Text] Former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik was in 
Paris early this week. His message was clear: Even though 
Slovakia has broken off its relations with the Czech Republic, 
it not does not want to be ejected outside Europe. 
  [Gautier] Your government, which opposed the nationalist 
policy of Meciar, managed to convince the Bratislava government 
to deal with the issue of the Hungarian minority. How did you 
do that? 
  [Moravcik] We had prepared an acceptable solution for the 
Slovaks, the Hungarians, and the other minorities. It was not a 
problem to convince the deputies. 
  [Gautier] Will you be the first prime minister to take down 
the "iron curtain" that has appeared between the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] The two republics of the former Czechoslovakia 
are 
young countries. They are going through an unnecessary period 
of restricted freedom of movement. It is difficult to persuade 
Prague to avoid that kind of obstacle. There is a real problem 
of migration. But we will abolish the border as soon as it has 
become unnecessary. 
  [Gautier] Within the framework of a Slovakia integrated into 
Europe? 
  [Moravcik] Yes. This is the message that we have brought 
with us to Paris. Slovakia envisages an integration into the 
European Union. My message is clear: Bratislava must not be 
ejected outside Europe. This is very important for the 
stability of the region. 
  [Gautier] Why did you chose France for you first visit as a 
head of government? 
  [Moravcik] I chose your country because France has 
understood 
the importance of Central Europe within Europe. 
  [Gautier] What was your message to President Mitterrand? 
  [Moravcik] We want relations with France to be fruitful for 
both countries. I stressed that we are working to establish the 
basis of a stable economy and political system. 
  [Gautier] The elections are scheduled for the end of 
September. The deposed prime minister has already launched his 
campaign. Do you think you will survive the election next fall? 
  [Moravcik] A large number of the electors have not made up 
their minds. Vladimir Meciar's popularity, which had been 
falling, has started to rise again since he was evicted by the 
parliament. But this time, it seems that a large part of the 
electors support our European and democratic policy. 
  [Gautier] What do you think of the scheduled return of the 
communists and Gyula Horn to power in Hungary? 
  [Moravcik] I have just had very interesting talks with Gyula 
Horn. I can envision cooperating with him. 
  [Gautier] Better than the cooperation with his predecessor, 
Peter Bross? 
  [Moravcik] (laughing) The search for solutions to the 
problems between Bratislava and Budapest is in our mutual 
interest. 
  [Gautier] Does Slovakia, which sent Blue Helmets to Bosnia, 
intend to follow the example of France and withdraw its troops? 
  [Moravcik] No. We want to continue with our peacekeeping 
mission in that region. It is in our interest. 
  [Gautier] Do you have a solution to the Bosnian conflict? 
  [Moravcik] It is a simple solution. We intend to apply the 
principles of a multiethnic society in Slovakia. These 
principles must be reintroduced in former Yugoslavia, as they 
have been in South Africa and the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Article by CTK and "(stk)": "Baudys Supports Russia and </F>
Defends Its Role in the `Euro-Asian Balance'"] 
  [Text] Prague--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys declared 
yesterday that it is necessary to respect Russia's special 
interests with regard to the North Atlantic Alliance. Russia is 
still, apparently, a superpower and has always been an important 
element of the Euro-Asian balance. "It is in the interest of 
the whole of Europe to ensure that this continues to be the 
case," said Baudys. 
  Baudys made this statement at yesterday's seminar on 
"Security in Central Europe--The Public's Views." The three-day 
seminar, which is being held in Prague, is organized by the 
North Atlantic Assembly in cooperation with the Czech Chamber of 
Deputies. The defense minister also said that it is most 
important for European security to ensure that cooperation 
between the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) and the former 
socialist bloc develops not only on a military basis, but, first 
and foremost, on an economic one. The foundation stone for 
peace apparently is economic prosperity. According to Baudys, 
the Visegrad Group should not be perceived as a political 
instrument for exerting pressure on NATO because Visegrad cannot 
be an alternative to or preparation for membership in the pact. 
"The issue of entry into NATO is so important that 
comprehensive economic, political, and social reforms within the 
state must be given precedence in dealing with it," said Baudys. 
In connection with the Partnership for Peace plan, the minister 
referred to the Czech presentation document, which contains 
offers of exercise areas, training, and so on. According to 
Baudys, the first step in this was the joint exercises with the 
Dutch marines. 
  According to Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka, who 
also 
took part in the conference, a Russian policy offensive is, on 
the other hand, now under way. "The possible renewal of 
Russia's influence in Europe can only be confronted by a 
consistent policy from NATO and the Western European Union," 
added Bratinka.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on opinions of officials from various </F>
political parties on the need to reorganize the government: 
"Party Opinions About Government Reorganization"] 
  [Text] Would you reduce the number of ministries and would 
you change the system of ministers without portfolio? Do you 
plan to set up a top economic ministry? 
  Gabor Kuncze, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]: 
  Yes, but this will depend on the coalition negotiations. 
  Tamas Isepy, Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]: 
  We can give the same answer to both questions because, in 
addition to streamlining the system of government institutions, 
our political program also includes the creation of an economic 
ministry in charge of carrying out a uniform management of the 
economy. The reduction in the number of ministries is a direct 
consequence of the implementation of this program. 
  The KDNP would definitely change the system of ministers 
without portfolio. Ministers without portfolio can be put in 
charge of carrying out tasks that can adjust to the tasks and 
authority of various ministries only with difficulty. The 
presence of a minister without portfolio in charge of national 
security services continues to be justified, but the institution 
of minister without portfolio should be eliminated in places 
where their task can be adjusted to the authority of a given 
ministry. 
  Zoltan Gal, Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]: 
  In every country, the number of ministries and the number of 
government members was also determined by political 
considerations, in addition to government rationale. Therefore, 
for the purpose of a rational government, the MSZP would reduce 
the number of ministries, but it is also ready to face the fact 
that the coalition agreement would not permit this. This 
applies to a reduction in the number of ministers without 
portfolio and to the setting up of a top economic ministry 
alike. A strong and coordinated government activity is our goal. 
  Karoly Herenyi, Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]: 
  The reduction or increase in the number of ministries is a 
practical question. The decisive viewpoint is which way the 
government operates the most efficiently. From this viewpoint, 
it seems rational today to merge certain ministries. The MDF 
agrees in principle with the setting up of a top economic 
ministry because we endeavored to do this in 1990, but the 
crisis management at the time demanded the special treatment of 
certain "areas." Today, after the elections, the conditions for 
a top economic ministry have matured. 
  Laszlo Urban, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]: 
  Yes. We are planning to set up a top economic ministry on 
the basis of the current Ministry of International Economic 
Relations, the economic policy department of the Finance 
Ministry, and the Industry Ministry. We would even subordinate 
the government institution in charge of carrying out the 
privatization to this top economic ministry. We also suggest to 
eliminate the position of minister without portfolio.

<F P=106> ["Speech of the President of the Republic Sali Berisha on </F>
the Inauguration of the Factory of Coca-Cola" in Tirana on 19 
May] 
  [Excerpt] Tirana, May 19 (ATA) -- [passage omitted] Two 
years ago Albania was freed through deep convulsions from one of 
the most brutal dictatorships Europe has known. Communism, with 
its "scorches earth policy" left us the consequences of the 
bunker type isolation as inheritance, an economy in collapse, a 
totally paralysed production, almost complete unemployment, 
outdated technology, the long queues, hunger, a budget 60 per 
cent of which was covered by the donation and humanitarian aid, 
a galloping inflation of 400 per cent a year. 
  In two years the Albanian Government was engaged in a course 
of radical and difficult reforms. On a retrospective analysis, 
we could say that in two years Albania managed to reduce 
inflation from 400 per cent to 30 per cent, to have a stable and 
practically convertible currency, to forget the long queues, to 
privatize the land, the flats, services, trade, transport and 
thousands of enterprises. 
  Exports increased 50 per cent in 1993, whereas imports rose 
only 7 per cent and the production increased 11 per cent, which 
is the highest growth rate in Europe. It is significant that 
even this year we are walking with such rapid strides, only the 
volume of construction increased 150 per cent without 
calculating individual construction. Albania until yesterday 
the country of forbidden cars, has imported during 1993, 50 
thousand vehicles, in the country of total television jamming 
about 30 thousand satellite dishes have been installed during 
one year alone. All these changes are accompanied by deep 
transformations in psychology of the Albanians who, according to 
recent studies, 79 per cent support the market economy; so they 
feel free from the state, have complete faith in the free 
initiative. We have quite another situation today as regards 
foreign investments. They have increased from 60 million 
dollars in 1992 to 290 million in 1993 and they are surely 
expected to be doubled in 1994 as a response to the stable 
finance conditions, free exchange, and trade operation. 
  Albania in its course of compensation for the lost time and 
integration into Europe has not a road covered with flowers. On 
the contrary, sacrifices, obstacles and difficulties lie ahead. 
But the case of Albania clearly testifies that the shock 
therapy, in spite of the pains it inflicts, is the safe road and 
the most successful for the transformation of a centralized 
economy into market economy. It is painful, but its marrow is 
freedom; that is why it must be accepted. Its fruit at the 
beginning is bitter, but when it is ripe, it is delicious as the 
freedom itself. 
  On the occasion of inauguration day of Coca-Cola, I would 
like to avail myself of this opportunity to say some words about 
the really favourable climate of investments that foreign 
friends now find in our country. It is true that Albania is a 
small country, but I would say that it displays serious real 
possibilities for foreign investors. The geographic position, 
the young age of the population, good qualification and 
education of the people, the very favouable labour market, the 
great natural resources in minerals such as chromium, copper, 
nickel, energy sources, water reserves and petroleum, the highly 
fertile land full of water and sunlight, its natural beauties 
and clear environment which also constitutes a great touristic 
potential, the political and economic stability, the policy of 
peace and prevention of the conflict, of the noble spirit and 
the hospitality of the Albanian make Albania, according to my 
opinion, a country really attractive to foreign investors. 
  But I think that more than all of these, importance is to be 
laid on the economic and liberal trade policy of the Albanian 
Government which aims, without doubt, at creating a much more 
attractive climate and the most favourable conditions for the 
free initiative and foreign investments which we consider to be 
an essential element of economic progress. The government and 
the parliament have established today an institutional framework 
and a legislation to ensure foreign investments and free 
initiative which reduce very much the so called country risk. 
  The Civil Code is sent to the parliament today, it completes 
the package of laws compatible on the banking system, fiscal 
management, the legislation of the companies, accounting and the 
like. The Law on Foreign Investment which has a special place 
in this package is in accordance with international standards 
for the protection of investors. The essential feature of this 
law is its liberal character and the freedom of action for 
foreign investors. It is intended also at eliminating 
bureaucratic procedures, it allows the transfer of the capital 
and profit, land-lease for 99 years at modest rates and in some 
cases even buying it. It provides guarantees for foreign 
investors against nationalization, expropriation, or other 
actions with similar effects. It is in compliance with 
generally recognized principles of international law and it is 
accompanied by a number of changes in easing the customs 
regulations. 
  I would like to recall here that today about 45 per cent of 
the values entering Albania are exempted from the customs. In 
order to stimulate foreign investments, the government has 
programmed the privatization of medium and large-scale 
enterprises which will facilitate the wide participation of 
foreign investors in these prices. In the same way, taking into 
consideration the role of infrastructure and its lacking, the 
government has decided 37 per cent of public investment for 
1993-1996 to go for infrastructure. The analysis of foreign 
investments in Albania indicates the real investments and 
commitments of the Albanian Government to do everything in its 
power to help foreign investors. We invite them to come to 
Albania, they are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by Kiril Vulchev] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofia, May 18 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov submitted structural and personnel changes of his cabinet 
to parliament. He did it when taking the vote; the MP's decided 
that the first item on today's agenda would be the debate on 
last Wednesday's no-confidence vote motion of the parliamentary 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). The SDS motivation for the 
no-confidence vote is "the prime minister's inability to 
organize and direct the activities of the government." This is 
the sixth no-confidence vote tabled by the parliamentary SDS so 
far. [passage omitted] 
  Following the opening of the debate on the no-confidence 
vote, the Prime Minister surprisingly introduced the intended 
cabinet changes. He nominated two deputy prime ministers. If 
approved by parliament, Assoc. Prof. Rumen Gechev, an economist, 
will be a deputy prime minister without portfolio coordinating 
the structural adjustment of the country's real economy, helping 
in the implementation of the government's general economic 
policy, acting as a coordinator for the PHARE [Economic and 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme and 
supervising the utilization of loans for the investments they 
are designed for, as well as the allocations of the State Fund 
for Reconstruction and Development. 
  Kiril Tsochev is Prof. Berov's nominee as a deputy prime 
minister who will supervise Bulgaria's balance of finances in 
connection with the foreign debt deals and the fluctuation of 
prices and the lev's exchange rate. This deputy prime minister 
will have to work for attracting foreign investments and promote 
the government's relations with private business. Mr. Tsochev 
will also be the minister of trade. When reporters asked the 
MP's who Mr. Tsochev is, nobody seemed to know anything about 
him; the prime minister was heard saying in the parliamentary 
lobbies that Mr. Tsochev had not been promoted by the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party]. 
  The prime minister asked the MP's to accept Valentin 
Karabashev's resignation as minister of trade he filed on April 
28. According to Prof. Berov, he and Mr. Karabashev have had 
differences over the variant of privatization to be implemented 
in Bulgaria since last spring. 
  The prime minister declared himself to be for the 
elimination 
of committees because the Constitution adopted in 1991 does not 
provide for such institutions. Prof. Berov proposed to set up 
two new ministries instead -- of energy and of communications, 
and promised to reorganize another three committees without 
setting up new ministries to replace them. He nominated Nikita 
Shervashidze, so far chairman of the Power Engineering 
Committee, as minister of energy, and Krustyu Mirski as minister 
of communications, specifying the latter was an expert in this 
field. 
  Prof. Berov proposed to dismiss Minister of Justice Petur 
Kornazhev and replace him by NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] MP 
Gospodin Atanasov. 
  If parliament approves the proposed changes, Prof. Berov's 
new cabinet will have 19 instead of 17 members, and four 
government agencies instead of three. 
  If his proposals are accepted next week, the prime minister 
would like a framework agreement between the government and the 
parliamentary forces or the individual MP's supporting it that 
will guarantee the adoption of the bankruptcy and the scheme of 
composition legislation as well as a bill amending the 
Privatization Act by the end of June at the latest. If the 
agreement is not signed, the cabinet is going to resign. The 
resignation will spoil the foreign debt deal, the mass 
privatization project will fail and Bulgaria's economic 
development will be seriously troubled, Prof. Berov told the 
MP's. 
  While Prof. Berov was introducing the cabinet changes, the 
DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement] MP's walked out of the 
parliamentary hall. Sherife Mustafa of the DPS told BTA that 
the DPS MP's were utterly surprised by the personnel changes 
which Prime Minister Berov had not discussed with the 
parliamentary DPS. According to Mrs. Mustafa, the nomination of 
Mr. Gechev as a deputy prime minister is unacceptable for the 
DPS because of his BSP affiliation. Holding a joint meeting 
later on, the DPS, the NSD and the group of independent MP's 
assessed the proposed changes as renunciation of the original 
government formula. 
  The DPS and NSD parliamentary groups came out with a joint 
declaration stating they would not vote for Prof. Berov's 
cabinet changes. In their opinion, Prof. Berov's are political 
appointees rather than experts as was the original formula of 
the government. The new formula is actually a coalition 
government with the BSP prominently represented in it. 
  By submitting his project for structural and personnel 
cabinet changes at a time when a procedure for debating a 
no-confidence vote has already been opened Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov, succumbing to pressure by the BSP, violated the 
Constitution, Petya Shopova of the Civil Alliance for the 
Republic (GOR), a left-of-centre formation, said after a meeting 
of the GOR and DPS parliamentary leaderships. 
  BSP leader Zhan Videnov said that most of Prof. Berov's 
nominees were entirely new for him. The BSP will discuss its 
attitude to the submitted cabinet changes at tomorrow's plenum 
of the party leadership and the leaders of its parliamentary 
group. 
  Asked if he considers his resignation as a possible option, 
the prime minister said he would go if parliament voted no 
confidence in him. The no-confidence motion will be put to the 
vote after 1800 hours tomorrow because under the Constitution, 
24 hours should elapse between the debates and the voting 
procedure.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 19 May "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- "Prime Minister Stuns 
Parliament" (the trade union daily TRUD), "Prime Minister Gets 
Mixed Up Kicking His Own Chair" (ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of 
the Bulgarian Agrarian Party), "MP's to Boycott Berov's Cabinet 
Overhaul" (the private daily STANDART NEWS), "Berov May Fall 
Today" (the private daily 24 CHASA) -- this is a sample of 
newspapers front-page headlines on Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's 
proposals for structural and personnel changes to the cabinet 
which he unveiled in parliament yesterday. Prof. Berov read his 
proposals at the beginning of debates on the sixth vote of no 
confidence in his cabinet the parliamentary Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS) moved for last week. The no confidence motion is 
to be put to the vote after 18:00 hrs today. 
  The private daily OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK stresses that "the New 
Union for Democracy (NSD, set up by breakaways and expelees from 
the parliamentary SDS), and the ethnic Turks' Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms (DPS, on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet 
was formed at the end of 1992), have withdrawn their political 
and parliamentary support for Prime Minister Berov." "The 
problem is whether the NSD and DPS joint declaration is mere 
words or actual intention," a signed commentary in the same 
daily says. 
  Citing Socialists, the SDS daily DEMOKRATSIYA writes that 
the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is expected to adopt a decision 
on toppling Prof. Berov and his cabinet at a plenum today. 
  "It is worth talking about a new cabinet if some six million 
Bulgarians have their say on it first", the socialist daily DUMA 
writes referring to a statement by BSP leader Zhan Videnov. 
Commenting on the NSD-DPS joint declaration, Mr. Videnov said 
that "the two parliamentary groups refuse to give credit to 
Lyuben Berov after he fulfilled all their wishes". 
  TRUD predicts that Prof. Berov's Cabinet will be succeeded 
by 
a government formed by centrist forces -- the DPS, the NSD, the 
independent MP's and the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR, 
part of whose members broke away from the BSP). Prof. Todor 
Vulchev, governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, is expected to 
head the new cabinet, the paper writes. The MP's' unwillingness 
to dissolve themselves before the expiry of their term is a 
guarantee for the appointment of a new cabinet, the paper says 
adding that the centrists and the moderate in the SDS and the 
BSP are expected to conclude an agreement. 
  "The SDS and the BSP would better admit that the bogging 
down 
of reform and the disintegration of the state is their fault, 
and not the fault of that cabinet of figure-heads," a signed 
commentary in 24 CHASA says. According to the publication, 
"more than four years have passed but the SDS, the BSP and the 
president still do not dare publicly name the price of the 
transition to a market economy which Bulgarians have been paying 
through the constant drop in their incomes, living standards and 
social status". "They say nothing about the price because they 
do not dare take the responsibility and govern the country in an 
open and honest way," the author points out. 
  "75 percent of Bulgarians disapprove of Parliament, 65 
percent are against Berov", 24 CHASA reports publishing the 
results of a representative opinion poll conducted by the BBSS 
Gallup International in May. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman 
today denied a REUTER report from Ankara, concerning a stand 
taken by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov on the 
commitment of Turkish troops to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At a news conference in Ankara, cited as 
a source by the authoritative news agency, Foreign Minister 
Daskalov confirmed Bulgaria's principled position against the 
involvement of neighbouring and Balkan countries in UNPROFOR in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, says a press release received at BTA. It 
was also stressed that this position was directed neither 
against Turkey nor against any other country in the region, the 
spokesman said. 
  On May 17 REUTER reported: "Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov said Bulgaria in principle opposed the 
involvement of Balkan countries in the conflict but did not 
object to Turkey sending troops to join a UN peacekeeping force 
in Bosnia."

  [Text] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- I state most categorically 
that Bulgaria is lagging more than two years behind all former 
socialist countries in the training of civilian experts for the 
needs of national security, Lieutenant General Stoyan Andreev, 
who heads the Military Training Reform Commission with the 
Defence Ministry, told journalists today. This is due to the 
stupidity shown in the taking of many important decisions by 
ignoramuses who for various reasons found themselves at the top 
after the fall of the totalitarian regime in 1989, the general 
said. The destructive attitude to the military industry led to 
its almost complete rout, General Andreev said. The system of 
scientific technological intelligence has also been ruined, 
according to him. There are no guarantees that there will be no 
painful experimenting with the fate of the state by the method 
of trial and error in the period before and after elections, 
General Andreev believes. 
  At a recently held meeting President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov and Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov 
agreed to set up a centre for training civilian personnel for 
the army and for the military training of civilian specialists, 
General Andreev said at a briefing today. The centre will work 
with the assistance of the G.S. Rakovski Military Academy in 
Sofia. The Defence Ministry intends to invite for training at 
the centre officials of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church because of 
its important role in raising the morale of the Bulgarian Army, 
General Andreev added. 
  From 6 to 10 senior officers will compete for a place in the 
one-year general staff courses which will start this autumn at 
the Military Academy, Major General Kiril Ermenkov, chief of the 
academy, said at the briefing. The training of Bulgaria's 
future strategists is an event of prime importance, General 
Andreev said. In this field too Bulgaria, whose generals were so 
far trained only abroad, is lagging behind the other former 
socialist countries, the Defence Ministry believes. The courses 
will be conducted by foreign and Bulgarian lecturers and leading 
specialists, politicians and scientists of the Bulgarian Academy 
of Sciences and of other institutes, the chief of the Military 
Academy said.

  [Text] Prague May 19 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
will not react to unofficial reports that NATO has conceded to 
pressure from Russia and offered it "special relations" with 
NATO alongside participation in the Partnership for Peace 
programme. Ministry spokesman Vit Kurfurst told CTK no official 
information on the offer had been received from Brussels. 
  Kurfurst reminded reporters of Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec's speech at the Charles University Law Faculty in 
Prague a month ago when he "said clearly that we signed the 
Partnership for Peace in the form of 16+1 (i.e. the 16 NATO 
states plus the Czech Republic), and not 16+1+Russia". 
  At his meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko on March 17, Zieleniec said that if Russia insisted on a 
special status in the Partnership for Peace programme, as 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had done several times, 
new negotiations on the programme would have to be launched. He 
said the Czech Republic was satisfied with the form of the 
programme and did not regard alteration as realistic. 
  According to unofficial information from Brussels, NATO's 
special relations with Russia are separate from the Partnership 
for Peace, offered by NATO in January to former communist bloc 
countries with an unspecified possibility of future alliance 
membership. 
  Besides the Czech Republic, 17 countries have so far joined 
the Partnership programme. At the beginning of the year, 
Russian representatives expressed willingness to join the scheme 
but later revised their view and accused NATO of not taking 
sufficient account of Russia's status as a great power.

  [Text] Prague, May 15 (CTK) -- Tomas Jezek is a brilliant 
economist and honest man, President Vaclav Havel commented on 
the speculations about Jezek's dismissal from his post of the 
chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM) in connection with 
his alleged mismanagement. Speaking today in his regular radio 
programme "Talks in Lany", Havel said that it was not up to the 
government, the political parties, let alone the president, to 
decide whether Jezek should remain in his post. The decision is 
in the powers of the FNM leadership, he added. 
  The bankruptcies of little banks can be a sort of appeal to 
those who quickly, and perhaps too quickly, have entered the 
world of the market economy, Havel said about the critical 
situation of the Bohemia a AB Mlada Boleslav banks. He 
expressed his conviction that the Czech bank sector was healthy 
as a whole. 
  Havel said that all the work of previous four years to 
improve the image of the Presidential Office and Prague Castle 
collapsed within two days because all the media have reported 
"how we steal here." This has created the situation when it will 
be difficult to find new sponsors, he said. "However, the 
articles are not based on real knowledge of the ruling by the 
inspecting office," Havel stated. 
  He said he considered this "a certain disaster." Havel said 
that the administrative mistakes (in the management of the 
Presidential Office) had not robbed the taxpayers of a single 
crown. 
  Asked whether journalists should be blamed for the 
misinterpretation of the report on management, Havel replied 
that the current situation has not been caused only by 
journalists. "The very unfortunate way of presenting the ruling 
without the relevant protocol," i.e. without an analysis or 
commentary, must be taken into account, too, he added.

  [Text] Prague, May 20 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel has 
signed the law on the restitution of Jewish property, Havel's 
spokesman Ladislav Spacek told journalists last night after 
Havel's meeting with the chairman and deputy chairmen of the 
Chamber of Deputies (parliament). 
  Spacek said that more detailed information concerning the 
signing of the law would be provided by the Presidential Office 
on Friday. The law, passed by parliament on April 29, was 
handed to the Presidential Office on May 5. Havel could have 
applied suspensive veto on the law. Some deputies said after 
its passing they would submit the law to the Constitutional 
Court as they believe it defined the victims of Nazism on the 
basis of racial aspects, and that it thus contradicts the 
Constitution. 
  At a dinner last night the prepared law on the Senate, the 
as 
yet non-existent upper chamber of the Czech parliament, was 
discussed, parliament Deputy Chairman Karel Ledvinka told 
journalists. He said the parliament officials had informed the 
president of the fact that "there is a good will in parliament 
to pass the law." 
  Spacek added that Havel prefers a two-round system for the 
Senatorial elections.

  [Text] Prague May 16 (CTK) -- If the elections were held 
today, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, the major government 
coalition party) would get 26 percent of the vote, according to 
a May survey conducted by the Institute for the Public Opinion 
Research (IVVM) among 788 respondents. The Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD, an opposition party) would get 11 
percent, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA, a member of the 
government coalition) 10 percent, and the Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM, opposition) and the Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL, a member 
of the government coalition) each five percent of the vote. 
  Support for the ODS has continued to fall, reaching an 
all-time low for the second time this year, whereas more people 
would vote smaller parties. The number of people who would vote 
the CSSD, ODA and KSCM generally remains stable. 
  The ODS tends to attract university-educated people (41 
percent), entrepreneurs (30 percent) and other employees (33 
percent), and it would obtain most support from towns with 
between 5,000 to 20,000 residents (34 percent) and the East 
Bohemian region (34 percent). Social democrats would get most 
of their support from villages with between 2,000 and 5,000 
residents (17 percent). The ODA would be chosen by 
university-educated people (20 percent and entrepreneurs (21 
percent) most often aged between 30 and 44. 
  The Communists would obtain most support from people with 
elementary education (9 percent) and by over-60's (10 percent). 
The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU- CSL) also has most supporters among the elderly (8 
percent). Fourteen percent of people from villages with up to 
500 inhabitants would vote this party. 
  The survey found that 71 percent of the respondents would go 
to the polls if the election were held today and 19 percent 
would not go, with 10 percent not knowing.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- Emphasizing the similar 
and complementary features of both of their parties' policy 
goals and fostering dialogue rather than debate was the main aim 
of today's electoral forum hosted by prime minister candidate 
for the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) Gabor Kuncze and the 
top economic specialist of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), 
Laszlo Bekesi. The forum, held in Budapest, was intended as a 
preliminary to the May 29 run-off of the parliamentary elections. 
  Bekesi and Kuncze said they see no obstacles to a governing 
coalition being formed between the two parties, and they both 
agreed that the new government should be led by a pragmatic and 
active prime minister. 
  Bekesi said the new prime minister should be a diplomatic 
personality with a great deal of tolerance, who would be able to 
introduce even the bitter pills by making people understand the 
sweetness they will bring in the future. The two men also feel 
that the Hungarian economy will reach its deepest point of 
recession next year. 
  Analysing the current state and prospects of the Hungarian 
economy, Bekesi said the next government would have a much more 
limited scope of action and resources for tackling much heavier 
tasks. "Despite the extremely strict measures the next 
government will have to take, Hungary's economic performance may 
decrease even next year," Bekesi said. 
  Kuncze added that, due to the erroneous or belated decisions 
of the outgoing government, the new one would have to adopt a 
forced course on seeking solutions for the economic ills. "The 
Hungarian economy is in a worse situation than it was four years 
ago," he said. He stressed the need for creating a more 
cost-efficient state, and phasing out all useless offices and 
functions. Kuncze forecast a 5 percent drop in real incomes 
next year, and Bekesi expects a 4 to 5 percent decline.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) will not change the tone of its campaign 
preceding the May 29 run-off of the parliamentary elections. 
Instead of slinging mud at its main rival, the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP), it strives to emphasize differences 
between the two parties and demonstrate why it would be 
advantageous for the country to vote for the Free Democrats, 
SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a party meeting at Budaors today. 
  "The SZDSZ fared well in the first round and retained almost 
all of its electoral base," Peto said, attributing his party's 
success to its unique reliability and well-founded policy. 
  "In the first round, voters cast their ballots on parties 
rather than candidates because they wanted to dismiss the 
governing coalition. Now they will rather consider which 
candidate would better fit the post," Peto said. 
  "For this reason, it would be advantageous for SZDSZ 
candidates to expound their views to the broadest possible 
audience, in various forums covered by local TV stations. In 
this competition, the SZDSZ has excellent chances because it has 
fielded plenty of highly qualified candidates," Peto said.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- It is uncertain what kind 
of governing coalition, if any, will be formed after the May 29 
run-off of the parliamentary elections. One thing is certain: 
Voters have dismissed the coalition that governed the country 
over the past four years, Gabor Kuncze, prime minister candidate 
of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), told a news 
conference in Papa, western Hungary, today. What will be at 
stake on May 29 is whether voters will authorize the Free 
Democrats to represent their interests with an appropriate 
weight, Kuncze said. 
  In his view, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) insists on 
a strategy which gained plenty of votes for the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP), the winner of the first round of the 
elections. 
  Failing to withdraw its candidates without any chance in the 
second round and frightening voters with a communist 
restoration, the MDF plays into the hands of the Socialists, and 
proves that it gives priority to party interests over national 
ones, Kuncze said. 
  SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar, meeting reporters in 
Miskolc today, said the second round would decide whether a 
balanced political culture emerges which makes it possible to 
form a stable government and a coalition based on partnership 
for the next four years, or the MSZP gains an absolute majority 
in parliament. For a balanced governing coalition to be formed, 
the SZDSZ must fare well in the second round of the elections, 
Magyar said.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- Commenting on the latest 
accord between the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) and 
the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP), FKGP Chairman 
Jozsef Torgyan said the Christian Democrats have recognized the 
need for inter-party cooperation in pursuing a national-oriented 
and populist policy which may be joined by all who wish to 
prevent a communist restoration and a shift to the left in 
Hungary. 
  Addressing an FKGP rally at Soltvadkert, southern Hungary, 
Torgyan said that his party, which won almost 9 percent of votes 
in the first round of the parliamentary elections and thus 
remained a parliamentary party, has clearly demonstrated that it 
is the only legitimate smallholder party which is accepted by 
the Hungarian people. 
  Torgyan qualified the outcome of the first round, the great 
rout by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), as a tragic 
development. In his view, "after four and a half decades of 
communist rule, four years were enough for the Hungarian nation 
to vote communism back in voluntarily." 
  Torgyan said that although the MSZP leaders do not seem to 
seek the restoration of communism, the party carries a mass of 
dead-weight, 99 percent of which came from the former state 
party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The FKGP 
chairman pressed for every possible step to be made to prevent 
the MSZP's further strengthening. 
  "Since the nation has not time to wait for four years and 
put 
its hope in changes, the Smallholders offer their support for 
the winners if they truly act in the interest of the Hungarian 
people. However, should the winners worsen the fate of the 
people, who already carry unbearable burdens, the FKGP will 
become a tough opposition," Torgyan said.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- "In keeping with its 
previously declared principles, the Independent Smallholders' 
Party [FKGP] will make no election pact with any party calling 
for the withdrawal of its individual candidates in favor of 
other parties' candidates in the second round of parliamentary 
elections from May 8 to 29. 
  A Smallholder alliance with the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] is out of the question: Smallholders feel that after the 
first round (May 8), MDF deputies with seats in parliament from 
party lists are closer to the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats 
than to the Smallholders. 
  However, the FKGP is discussing possible long-term 
cooperation with the Christian Democrats, FKGP Deputy Chairman 
and campaign chief Mrs. Nagy G. Agnes Maczo told reporters in 
Budapest on Thursday.

  [Text] Budapest, May 18 (MTI) -- "We believe that those who 
voted for the Socialist Party in the first round of 
parliamentary elections on May 8 wanted a change and considered 
us to be a predictable, open and expert party," Hungarian 
Socialist Party (HSP) [MSZP] deputy chairman Imre Szekeres told 
a press conference in Tiszaujvaros (E Hungary) on Wednesday. 
  The HSP would like to see Hungary ruled by a coalition 
government pursuing three major foreign-policy aims: rapid 
integration with European structures, including NATO; normalized 
relations with neighbouring countries; and ensuring autonomy for 
cross-border Hungarian minorities. 
  "It would be good if the country had a fully-formed new 
government by late June or early July. The HSP is ready to 
conduct expeditious coalition talks in public," Szekeres said.

  [Text] Budapest, May 18 (MTI) -- "The new parliament will 
need a strong opposition so as to be able to the preserve 
democratic achievements of the last four years," Prime Minister 
Peter Boross, who is heading the Hungarian Democratic Forum"s 
national election list, told an election forum in the west 
Hungarian village of Gyor on Wednesday. 
  He warned that if the Socialists gain a supreme government 
position in the parliamentary elections, living conditions will 
not improve, against all promises. Boross said that those who 
voted "left" in hope of a better life are set to face a bitter 
surprise. In the years to come, less will be spent on research, 
culture, sport and urban development, he presumed.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- "The Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] has quickly recovered after the shock which the May 
8 election result caused to its voters and organizers," MDF 
acting chairman Sandor Lezsak told the party's news conference 
in Budapest on Thursday. He said he believes broad cooperation 
between conservative forces could obstruct a Socialist-Liberal 
majority in the new parliament. 
  According to Lezsak, many people want to vote on May 29 for 
fear of an overwhelming ruling power leading to autocratic rule 
and a constitutional dictatorship. On June 4, the MDF's 
National Board will look into the reasons behind the party's 
poor election performance. It will also decide whether to 
discuss past and current affairs with delegates of the 8th 
National Convention, or to elect new delegates, and select a 
date for the next national meeting sometime before October.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- In the first leg of the 
two-round Hungarian general elections, held on May 8, two seats 
were won in individual constituencies and 125 from party lists 
out of the 386 seats of Hungary's one-chamber parliament. The 
race is to continue until May 29 to win the remaining 259 
mandates, of which 174 will be distributed to individual 
candidates. (Altogether, there are 176 individual constituencies 
but in two of them the first round ended with final results -- 
bringing victory to Socialists in both seats.) 
  Left-over votes cast on party lists in the first round will 
decide the future of 27 parliamentary seats, which are to be 
allocated proportionately between the 6 parties that reached a 
minimum of five percent of the votes in the first round. Five 
percent is the threshhold that has to be passed by a party to 
get into parliament. The allocation itself is to be carried out 
only after the second round, when all results are known. As 
many as 58 deputies are to be elected from national party lists, 
based on the proportion of fractional ballots received by the 
parties' individual candidates in the first round. The two 
types of fractional votes will be added up, processed, and 
distributed by the National Election Committee after the second 
round. 
  The run-off should give conclusive results in 174 individual 
constituencies where no candidates received more than half of 
the valid votes in the first round. The second round will 
feature candidates who received at least 15 percent of the valid 
votes in the first round (if there fewer than three candidates 
poll 15 percent, the three with the highest numbers of votes), 
which will be won by the candidate who receives most valid 
votes. (First round votes will not be added into run-off 
results.) Results will be valid in a district if the turn-out 
is at least 25 percent plus one voter. In case the turn-out is 
lower somewhere, by-elections are expected to follow in 1995. 
  Of the maximum 152 seats obtainable through party lists, 125 
have been allocated and 27 are to be filled after May 29. 
Altogether, 259 mandates will be distributed on the basis of 
the second round. 
  The ratio of the 125 party-list seats decided in the first 
round is as follows (with the proportion of votes in brackets): 
  1. Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP): 53 (32.99) 
  2. Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ): 28 (19.74) 
  3. Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF): 18 (11.74) 
  4. Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP): 14 (8.82) 
  5. Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ): 7 (7.02) 
  6. Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP): 5 (7.03) 
  Although these votes will not be added in, numbers of seats 
where each party was in first place give some idea of how voting 
might go in the second round. The MSZP had candidates in first 
place in 160 constituencies in the first round, while the SZDSZ 
had 12, and the MDF and the KDNP one each.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- On Tuesday [17 May] 
journalists received a written statement on the Monday meeting 
between Hungarian Foreign Minister Jeszenszky and Yugoslav 
Deputy Prime Minister Simic, denying that Hungary saw sanctions 
against Yugoslavia as useless. The foreign affairs spokesman 
said that Simic's remark about his complete agreement with 
Jeszenszky that UN sanctions against rump Yugoslavia have become 
absurd was inaccurate. "Hungary's position on the embargo is 
unchanged," the spokesman said. 
  Simic also indicated that, in keeping with the January talks 
of President Milosevic and Jeszenszky, concrete steps will soon 
be taken to resolve problems for Hungarians in the Serbian 
region of Vojvodina. There will be negotiations between the 
Serb Government and the Democratic Hungarian Community of 
Vojvodina (VMDK). Hungary asked Yugoslavia to demonstrate its 
commitment to promoting peace, lessening tension, and settling 
the crisis. 
  The United Nations would see licensing of CSCE missions in 
Yugoslavia, ensurance of free navigation on the Danube, easing 
of tension in Kosovo, and progress in guaranteeing the rights of 
Serbia's minorities, including ethnic Hungarians, as gestures 
towards peace. The Hungarian side was happy at Serbia's 
readiness to open talks with the VMDK.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 16 -- Commenting on the decision of 
Minister Michal Kulesza to resign from the post of government 
commissioner for public administration reform, Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak said on Monday that he "expected more 
responsibility in these actions." Pawlak added he hoped "a 
slightly different outlook on introducing reforms might be 
helpful in working out final solutions." 
  "We are supporting decentralisation but at the same time we 
are not going to put responsibility on local governments in a 
way which is making it impossible for them to fulfil these 
tasks," the prime minister stressed, adding that for instance it 
was local governments which decided whether to take over 
schools. The prime minister also said the cabinet was 
supporting the plan to grant more powers to local authorities. 
  Commenting on Kulesza's statement that the assumptions of 
the 
socio-economic policy for the years 1994-1997 and draft laws on 
state administration prove that the cabinet is not interested in 
Poland's decentralisation, the head of the cabinet office, 
Minister Marian Strak, said: "I think that this opinion is 
resulting either from incomplete knowledge of the documents or 
ill will." Strak stressed the documents proved the cabinet 
wanted to increase powers of local governments and to 
consolidate the position of a governor. "The point is to make a 
governor a host in a province and not one of the parts of the 
state administration," he added.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 18 -- According to a forecast prepared 
by the Agriculture Ministry and the Agricultural Market Agency 
grain crops will amount to about 25.1 million tons this year and 
will be higher by over 1.5 million tons than in 1993, Deputy 
Agriculture Minister Jerzy Pilarczyk told the Senate Agriculture 
Committee on Wednesday. 
  If the forecast proves true farmers will want to sell some 3 
million tons of grain this year. However, according to the 
Chairman of the Agricultural Market Agency Kazimierz Gutowski 
grain storage and processing plants will be able to purchase 
about a million tons and the agency a further 800,000 tons. 
Other enterprises will have to be found to purchase the 
remaining 1.5 million tons that can be offered by farmers, he 
told the senators. 
  The State Atomic Energy Agency will prepare within a year 
and 
present to the government a programme of ecologically safe 
storage of radioactive waste materials, the agency's president 
Jerzy Niewodniczanski told the senate's Environment Protection 
Committee on Wednesday. 
  During the discussion on the subject the senators focused on 
the activity of services responsible for monitoring the level of 
concentration of radioactive substances in the air, water and 
soil as well as the preparation of border guards in discovering 
and foiling the attempts at smuggling hazardous substances into 
Poland.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 13 -- Deputy Defence Minister Jerzy 
Milewski on Friday reported to the Sejm about the main points of 
the Defence Ministry policy toward the Polish arms industry. He 
said that sixty to seventy per cent of the Defence Ministry 
orders would be placed with the home arms industry. He added 
that the Defence Ministry cannot assume responsibility for debts 
from the previous period. 
  There is an agreement between the Polish Defence Ministry 
and 
the United States Defence Department providing for promotion of 
a programme of the Polish Armed Forces modernization. The 
cooperation in this field envisages production based on U.S. 
latest technologies, Milewski said. He added that Poland had 
not concluded any other agreement with the U.S. Polish arms 
industry cooperates also with arms industries of France, Sweden 
and Israel. 
  Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the defence minister in the Hanna 
Suchocka Government, said that Poland has large facilities for 
overhauling military equipment becuase such were the tasks 
Poland performed within the Warsaw Treaty. 
  Deputies of different groupings demanded that a general 
debate on issues related to the defence be held in June.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/5/1994 -- A return to 
communist regime "is no longer possible. The old totalitarian 
regime has been demolished. It is a dialectical process and it 
is our duty to adjust to other rules, the rules of the end of 
the 20th century, when the tendency to integrate all national 
economies into the world economy is a dominant," President Ion 
Iliescu stated during a meeting at the Oradea Municipality City 
Hall. 
  President Iliescu admitted that adjustment to the new 
situation has generated severe social issues, but pointed out 
that the causes of such phenomenon must be traced down and 
eliminated, rejecting the wish of some to return to the old 
totalitarian rule. President Iliescu pleaded for dialogue as a 
means to solve most of the social issues: "It is good to listen 
to each other and to learn from the experience of each other. 
This is the fundamental element that rules our democracy, for a 
society keeps developing when all human potentials are being 
capitalised," Iliescu said. 
  The meeting at Oradea City Hall took place after a visit 
paid 
by President Ion Iliescu to the Bihor County. "It has been a day 
of fruitful contacts and dialogues that were beneficial for me, 
for I had the possibility to directly get acquainted with the 
issues confronting people and with their thoughts," President 
Iliescu told a ROMPRES editor. "As a general feature, I would 
mention the people's concern for the really big issues 
confronting our economy, such as the financial blockage, 
inflation and unemployment, as well as their wish for an 
economic revival." 
  President Ion Iliescu's fact-finding trip is to include on 
Thursday the Satu Mare County.

  [Text]) In an open letter published in several dailies of 
19 May Ioan Stoica, owner of the Caritas money-spinning scheme, 
has announced the closing of the game. Parading self-assurance, 
Ioan Stoica says that work is going on "on the overall accounts 
of the scheme," which, once completed, will allow him to give 
"details on the normal way of shutting it down in all localities 
where the company has subsidiaries." Without being overly 
explicit about the way how he will pay back the investors' 
money, Ioan Stoica says in his letter: "I promise I will do 
everything in my power to close this scheme in such a way as to 
satisfy every person." 
  The Caritas owner blames the failure of the scheme on the 
press, terming it "that important force that has savagely hit 
the Caritas." Caritas was started more than two years ago, in 
Brasov, as a limited commercial company, including in its 
activities also the pyramid money-spinning scheme which Stoica 
calls "financial mutual-aid circuit for charity purposes." 
Briefly, the scheme functioned like this: Intensely 
advertised, Caritas promised investors they would be able to 
collect eightfold the initial deposit after three months. 
Cluj-Napoca was the city where Caritas took on unsuspected 
proportions soon. The well advertised success of the first 
months turned the Caritas into a genuine social phenomenon. 
Chain-letter schemes of the kind mushroomed soon all over the 
country, with unscrupulous "enterprisers" cheating an impressive 
number of investors. Sooner or later, all ended up in courts of 
law. The longest-lived has been precisely the one that started 
this wide-scale scheme: Caritas. After being forbidden by 
court decision to open a subsidiary in Bucharest, the scheme 
became undesirable in almost all counties of Romania. 
  The catastrophic failure of the money-spinning schemes, 
finally disclosed as a tremendous nation-wide fraud, also 
induced a concrete parliamentary reaction: the promotion of a 
bill to ban them. 
  The Caritas also fuelled fierce political duels between the 
Romanian National Unity Party leader Gheorghe Funar and the 
Democratic Party/National Salvation Front leader Petre Roman, 
each blaming the other for having backed Ioan Stoica's 
"initiative." The press assesses that the Caritas' victims 
count some four million. It is hard to predict how this big 
scandal will end.

  [Text] Moscow May 19 (CTK) -- The visit of leader of the 
ultra-national Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, which was to take place at the weekend, has been 
postponed indefinitely, the party's representatives told CTK 
today. They said the decision had been made at today's session 
of a faction of the Liberal Democrats, adding that the reason 
was a bribery scandal involving members of the faction. 
  "Vladimir Volfovich must stay in Moscow for the time being. 
This is a fault of the irresponsible journalists who are as 
always slandering the Liberal Democratic Party," head of the 
party's faction in the State Duma (lower house of parliament) 
Andrey Losev told CTK. "The visit has been postponed at the 
moment. It is difficult to say when it will take place," he 
added. 
  Commentator Nikoli Svanidze said last week on Russian 
Television that Zhirinovskiy had promised each member of his 
party $500 if they voted in favour of the government-submitted 
draft state budget. The Liberal Democrats want to lodge a 
complaint against Svanidze and they demand that he be barred 
temporarily from the television screen at least. 
  Zhirinovskiy was to come to Bratislava at the weekend at the 
invitation of private businessman Ladislav Mojzis and Jozef 
Lauko, who was a guest at the April congress of Zhirinovskiy's 
party in Moscow. 
  Originally Zhirinovskiy was also to visit Prague on March 
20, 
but the visit at the invitation of the extreme-right Assembly 
for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) was 
cancelled after a representative of the Liberal Democrats met 
with a Czech Embassy official. 
  According to unofficial sources in Moscow, the 
representative 
informed the Liberal Democrats that the Czech Government 
considered their leader's visit to Prague "most inappropriate" 
and that it would use all legal possibilities to prevent it. 
Zhirinovskiy explained the indefinite postponement of this 
visit by the SPR-RSC's refusal to finance his trip.

  [Text] Bratislava May 19 (CTK) -- The European Pact of 
Stability, or the Balladur Plan, is acceptable for Slovakia in 
its proposed form, Igor Liska from the Foreign Ministry told CTK 
today. The acceptability of the working version of the pact was 
also confirmed by Slovak Ambassador to Geneva Jan Kubis who had 
led the Slovak delegation to the talks on the pact. The pact 
has also been supported by Premier Jozef Moravcik during his 
visit to France this week. 
  Kubis said that the latest version of the document ruling 
out 
border changes suited Slovakia. Of late voices could be heard 
in Hungary urging a revision of the Slovak-Hungarian border to 
the benefit of Hungary. A strong Hungarian minority lives in 
southern Slovakia. 
  Slovakia has also welcomed the deletion of that part of the 
text which bound Slovakia and Hungary to conclude an inter-state 
treaty under the auspices of the European Union. 
  Bratislava sticks to the civic principle on ethnic 
minorities, which means that it would not recognise minorities' 
collective rights. Collective rights for ethnic minorities are 
also rejected by most Western countries. The Czech Republic 
rejects the principle as well. 
  Kubis said on Wednesday [18 May] that the Czech and Slovak 
Republics had not coordinated their policies on the pact, 
because the Czech Republic unlike Slovakia did not have any 
minority problems. Kubis also pointed out Slovak diplomacy's 
effort to broaden the pact's goals to embrace economic, 
environmental and cross-border cooperation as well.

  [Text] Bratislava May 19 (CTK) -- Katarina Tothova, the 
ex-minister of justice and a member of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), does not think that public 
competition for the posts of state officials, the conditions of 
which the HZDS published in the form of an advertisement in the 
daily PRAVDA on Friday [13 May], was incorrect or even illegal. 
"Everybody may do everything which is not forbidden by the 
law," Tothova said today at a press conference of the "shadow 
cabinet" of the HZDS leader and former premier, Vladimir Meciar. 
  She said she considered it highly moral that the HZDS was 
preparing its own potential of experts, and recommended other 
parties to follow suit. She said she expected the HZDS to be 
represented in the government after the autumn elections. 
  Although polls have shown a decline in the HZDS's 
popularity, 
the movement still enjoys the highest confidence of voters (27 
percent), and has great election ambitions. 
  On Wednesday [18 May], PRAVDA rescinded the contract with 
the 
HZDS for its "not keeping to the advertising rules." The 
full-page advertisements worth almost 2.5 million crowns 
($80,600) will not be published any longer. Besides the 
conditions of public competition, they also included attacks 
against Slovak President Michal Kovac and some members of the 
present cabinet of Jozef Moravcik.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak National 
Party (SNS) is returning to its original national principles 
because the young Slovak Republic is a thorn in the flesh of 
certain foreign forces and Slovaks nostalgic for the federation, 
Party Chairman Jan Slota tells today's edition of SLOVENSKA 
REPUBLIKA, close to ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  Although entering the elections independently the SNS will 
still "cooperate closely" with Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota says. "We decided on 
independent candidacy in the elections because with joint 
candidacy our party would lose its identity." "In every nation 
state a real political force should exist that protects the 
interests of the nation. In the case of Slovakia it is the 
SNS," he tells the paper. 
  Slota says he is disturbed by the attempts of Hungarian 
politicians to declare the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia 
to be part of the Hungarian nation. "From the SNS point of view 
we can only talk of Slovaks who speak Hungarian," he says. 
  Accordingly the party intends to defend the Slovaks living 
in 
the south, where Hungarians form a majority: pushing for a law 
protecting Slovak as the main language in all schools, armed 
services, in the population register and other documents. They 
also vow to reject an ethnic conception in the envisaged 
reorganization of local government. 
  Speaking of SNS rivals in the run-up to the elections (to be 
held on September 30-October 1), Slota denounces parties of the 
right as being either manifestly pro-Czech or mere vehicles for 
the "personal ambition of bankrupt turncoats from the SNS and 
HZDS." The latter, however, will not be able to form a 
coalition because "they lack unified political foundations, even 
though many have shown that, enticed by a vision of personal 
gain, they are capable of selling out." He says the SNS is 
united and dismisses rumors he might be ousted from the position 
of chairman as disinformation.

  [Text] Bratislava May 18 (CTK) -- If parliamentary 
elections were held now, 27 percent of voters would support for 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), according to a 
poll conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office (SU SR) whose 
results were handed to CTK today. In April, 32 percent of those 
polled said they would vote for the HZDS. The HZDS-led 
government fell in March following a parliamentary no-confidence 
vote in former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  The Democratic Left Party (SDL) with 16 percent support 
fares 
three percent better than in April. 
  The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), led by ex-Premier 
Jan Carnogursky, with 11 percent support also gained three 
percent against April, followed by the coalition between 
Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
supported by seven percent of voters. 
  In contrast, Premier Josef Moravcik's Democratic Union of 
Slovakia (DEUS) with current support of five percent was the 
only party in the current government coalition to receive less 
voter preference than in April (seven percent). 
  The Slovak National Party (SNS) and the Greens Party would 
each obtain four percent of the vote, the Social Democratic 
Party in Slovakia (SDSS), the Slovak Workers' Party and the 
National Democratic Party -- New Alternative (NDS-NA) each three 
percent of the vote and the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party 
of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SSPZ) each two percent 
of the vote. Eight percent of the respondents did not know for 
whom they would vote.

  [Text] Bratislava May 17 (CTK) -- The time has come for 
Slovakia to make good the promises it made a year ago when 
entering the Council of Europe, Pal Csaky, a deputy for the 
ethnic Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH), told CTK 
today. Next week the parliament will deal with governmental 
bills designed to satisfy the basic demands of the ethnic 
minorities. In Slovakia there are 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (10 
percent of the population). 
  "Deputies have a great opportunity to show their willingness 
to be tolerant and their ability to think democratically," Csaky 
commented on the amendments to the laws on registration offices, 
official language and administrative set-up. 
  The laws will make it possible for the ethnic minorities to 
use their first and family names in their original form. 
Moreover, towns and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic 
minority members will have the right to a place-name in the 
minority's language. 
  The opposition and Matica Slovenska [Slovak Heritage 
Foundation] have protested against the proposals approved by the 
government. Matica Slovenska is a cultural and educational 
organisation which strives to preserve Slovak legacy and 
national feelings. Its leadership stated that the prepared 
bilingual names of 560 towns and villages were reminiscent of 
the "Horthyite occupation" (by Hungary between 1938 and 1945) of 
south Slovakia and that it feared a threat to integrity of the 
young state. 
  "The issue can be abused for an all-out struggle between the 
current and past coalitions," Csaky said. "Matica is playing a 
negative role in shaping modern society. It is not able to get 
rid of prejudice and people with political ambitions," he 
stated, adding that Matica, being a cultural institution, should 
not meddle in politics. 
  Csaky described as "pure nonsense" the statement by Roman 
Hofbauer, former transport minister in Vladimir Meciar's 
government, that the bilingual names would require modifying of 
all official documents, while people would have to master, use 
and respect all the variants of the names. "The laws will not, 
of course, harass anybody," Csaky stated. 
  On the decision of the Slovak National Party (SNS, 9 
deputies 
in the 150-seat Slovak parliament) to allow only native Slovaks 
to join the party Csaky noted: "I regret this, but it is no 
surprise in a party with views from the 18th or the 19th 
centuries." 
  Csaky pleaded for the formation of a coalition of three 
ethnic Hungarian groupings, Egyutteles (9 deputies), the MKDH (5 
deputies) and the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS, 
extra-parliamentary) for the forthcoming elections (September 
30-October 1). He dismissed the proposal by Egyutteles Chairman 
Miklos Duray for creation of a union. "The election law mentions 
only parties and coalitions, not unions," Csaky stated, adding 
that the MOS had its electoral base so that neither the MKDH nor 
the Egyutteles would be damaged by the three-member coalition.

  [Text] Tirana, May 14 (ATA) -- A fierce debate is 
continuing in the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] parliament in regard to the census. 
Referring to sources from Skopje, the Albanian Television 
reported that the Albanian deputies requested on May 13, that 
the document of the citizenship be presented during the census 
because the Interior Ministry is not able to provide them; 
Albanians who work abroad be treated as citizens of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and also be included in the 
general number of the population, not in special categories. 
  The Albanian deputies requested also that several Albanian 
people be employed at the Statistical Enterprise and a formulary 
sample should remain at the families who have been registered. 
  The amendments of the Albanians deputies did not find 
support 
and caused uncontrolled reactions by the Macedonian deputies. 
According to the Macedonian deputies, these amendments request 
the legalization of the Albanians who have come from Kosova, 
Serbia, and Albania. The Macedonian deputies supported 
indirectly the thesis that the Albanians of Macedonia have 
Macedonian citizenship and should be declared as Macedonians. 
The parliament stopped its proceedings because of the tense 
atmosphere created by partial and dissuading discussion.

  [Text] Tirana May 20 (ATA) -- The parliament of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], approved the Law on the 
Census of Population, after a long debate and also in the 
presence of the experts of the Council of Europe, reports the 
Albanian TV correspondent, from Skopje. The census will be 
conducted from June 21 to July 1st of this year. 
  The commission of the Council of Europe that is staying in 
Skopje, met with the Albanian representatives and the VMRO 
[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization] group, 
regarding the draft law on population census, before the holding 
the parliament's session. The content of the talks is not yet 
known but the chairman of the experts' team, Vener Hog [name as 
received], declared that they support the draft law and their is 
no room for any change in it. The law, said he, is a 
compromising setting, where each side wins something, but none 
of them all. 
  The Albanians declared that they support the general census 
of population only under the international supervision.

  [Text] Prishtina, May 18 (ATA) -- A considerable number of 
Serb soldiers are deployed recently in the border area between 
Albania and Kosova so banning the Albanian farmers from using 
the pasture land. They have declared it "forbidden area," 
because it is near the border zone. The army has blocked the 
roads that lead to the pasture land and conducts a severe 
search, prohibiting so the free pass of people. 
  Against such measures, have reacted the Albanian political 
subjects of Decan commune and has appealed to the farmers to be 
cautious not to fall into the trap of the Serb militaries.

  [Text] Prishtina, May 19 (ATA) -- Mirko Cupioi, chairman 
of the regional council of criminal Arkan's party, based in 
Prishtina, declared in the newspaper JEDINSTVO that "one can not 
even think of dialogue with the Albanians." According to him, 
the Kosova status will be negotiated with no one, less so "with 
those residing in the foreign land," alluding to the ethnic 
Albanians of Kosova. Further on, he reveals that the Serb Unity 
Party has a wide and detailed program on Kosova, which predicts 
the fast establishment of national parity with the settling of 
500 thousand Serbs in Kosova and the expulsion of 465 thousand 
Albanians to Albania. 
  On the other hand, the leaders of Seselj's radicals in 
Kosova, Miodrag Jevric, declares in the newspaper BORBA that the 
participants of national minorities should not be provided with 
weapons during military service, whereas those who do not 
respond to the order for military service "can buy the military 
term" at 5,000 U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Tirana, May 18 (ATA) -- The Prishtina Albanologist 
Institute violently banned by the Serbian authorities on March 
8, 1994, resumed today its activity in a private house, Behlul 
Jashari, the ATA correspondent in Prishtina, reported today. 
The institute director, Dr. Sadri Fetiu, said in an interview 
with ATA, that the institute will publish this year 32 
scientific works. 
  Mr. Fetiu said: "The greatest difficulty is the isolation of 
the institute from the scientific and intellectual world 
especially with the scientific institutions of Albania because 
of the obstacles put by the Serbian authorities who do not allow 
the world literature to pass to the Prishtina Library and vice 
versa.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The trial of former communist 
President Ramiz Alia and nine high Communist Party and state 
functionaries began today. Here is Marrash Mirashi. 
  [Mirashi] [passage omitted] The primary former heads of the 
communist nomenklatura were again gathered together, but this 
time not to give directives but to render account to Albanian 
justice. [passage omitted] 
  After presenting the defendants and their counsels, they 
were 
asked whether they agreed with the judicial body or not. 
Defense Counsel Kleanthi Koci and his client, defendant Ramiz 
Alia, did not agree with the judicial body, claiming that it is 
not of high stature and lacks experience. This was followed by 
other defendants and their counsels. Koci asked that the trial 
be suspended for defendant Alia. 
  Their respective defense attorneys asked that the trial of 
defendants Zylyftar Ramizi and Veiz Haderi be set apart from the 
rest of the group, because they had been soldiers and cannot be 
judged by a civil court. They also asked for new witnesses. 
  Defendant Alia requested that television broadcast the trial 
in full, saying: I have been head of state and the people should 
know what I have to say. In response, the chairman of the 
judicial body stressed that the media is free. 
  The prosecutor was asked to change the security measures for 
defendant Simon Stefani. Later, the presentation of witnesses 
was held. There was a great number of witnesses, among whom 
were old state and party apparatus workers, dependents or 
colleagues of the defendants, but also people harmed by the 
activity of the defendants in this trial. 
  The judicial body withdrew to make decisions on the demands 
put forward. Mr. Celiku, chairman of the judicial body, then 
took the floor. He found the aforementioned demands not based 
on law and rejected them. 
  Prosecutor Neshat Thana read out an approximately 60-page 
indictment. Defendants Ramiz Alia, Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu, 
and Rita Marko are facing charges of conspiring to 
misappropriate state property for a total amount of 2,883,502 
leks and of the abuse of power, resulting in the illegal 
violation of the fundamental rights of citizens and financial 
damages amounting to 484,778 leks. 
  Defendants Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai were charged with 
conspiring to abuse their positions, resulting in the illegal 
violation of the fundamental rights of citizens to the detriment 
of the lives of several persons, murders committed at the 
border, and violation of the equality of citizens through the 
creation of privileges. 
  Aranit Cela and Rrapi Mino are charged with conspiring to 
abuse their positions, resulting in the illegal violation of the 
fundamental rights of citizens. 
  Zylyftar Ramizi is charged with conspiring to abuse his 
position, resulting in the illegal violation of the fundamental 
rights of citizens to the detriment of people's lives. 
  Veiz Haderi is charged with conspiring to abuse his 
position, 
resulting in humiliating acts against citizens detained or 
killed at the border. 
  The indictment contained concrete examples of genocide, 
violence, and abuse. After the indictment was read, the 
chairman of the judicial body took the floor: 
  [Begin recording] [Celiku] Did you hear the indictment? Did 
you understand it? What is your position on it? Do you accept 
it or not? [end recording] 
  [Alia] The indictment? I do not accept it. [end recording] 
  Just like the defendant Ramiz Alia, none of the other 
defendants or their counsels accepted the indictment. 
  At the end of today's trial hearing, the order in which the 
defendants would be questioned was decided. The chairman of the 
judicial body then closed the hearing. The next session will 
begin at 0900 tomorrow morning with the interrogation of the 
defendants.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Foreign Ministry of Albania"; place and </F>
date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Being informed that the Greek Government 
representative blocked the decision to grant 35 million ECU's to 
Albania for assistance with the balance of payments at the 16 
May 1994 meeting of the EC economy and finance ministers, the 
Foreign Ministry expresses its regret over this action, which 
runs counter to the European Union [EU] Commission 
recommendations and the unreserved approval of the European 
Parliament. Besides this, no other representative from the 12 
EC countries present in the aforementioned meeting had any 
objection to granting this assistance. We stress that this 
assistance was recommended by the IMF. 
  We would like to point out that such an act is neither in 
conformity with the EC's revolving presidency, which Greece 
holds, nor with the relations of good-neighborliness that Greece 
professes to have with Albania, and the efforts made to improve 
the relations between Albania and Greece. 
  The claim that the Greek authorities are dissatisfied with 
the respect for the rights of the Greek minority in Albania 
cannot be taken as sincere and serious, as these cases have been 
examined by the EU Commission and Parliament and no other 
country of this community that is interested and informed on 
developments in Albania presented such observations. 
  Over the last two years, dozens of international commissions 
of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the EU have come and 
they have made no significant observations, apart from asserting 
the great improvement in the situation and in the rights of the 
Greek minority. 
  We also express our regret that, because of political 
passions, the Greek Government does not hesitate to penalize, 
with this act, the Greek minority, by blocking assistance aimed 
at the development of reforms in Albania, from which the 
minorities would profit along with all other Albanian citizens. 
  Considering its timing, such an action is prejudicial for 
the 
meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, 
proposed by the Albanian side and accepted by the Greek side. 
  We hope that the EC's 12 other member countries, which have 
given great assistance to Albania in this difficult period of 
transition, will not comply with such a stance, which aims at 
blocking reforms and will influence the approval of this 
assistance. We believe that the blocking policy does not do 
honor to Greece, the EC's revolving president, from whom its 
neighbors are waiting for concrete assistance in the common 
interest of integration, stability, and peace in the region.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Tirana branch of the Committee for 
the Protection of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church 
intends to put an end to the temporary stay of [Archbishop] 
Janullatos in Albania. This was stated at a joint meeting that 
this committee organized with the Tirana branch of the 
Association of Political Persecutees. For more details we go 
over to our correspondent, Arben Karapici: 
  [Karapici] It seems that Archbishop Anastasios Janullatos 
has finished his stay and temporary religious mission in 
Albania. This is, at least, the opinion of the Committee for 
the Protection of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, 
which was confirmed at a joint meeting with the branch of the 
Association of Former Political Persecutees in Tirana. 
  Several cases were reported on at this meeting. The latest 
was in Elbasan, where the Orthodox believers of this city asked 
Janullatos to consecrate Nikolla Marko from Elbasan as 
archbishop of the city's Orthodox Church. As a response to this 
demand by the Elbasan Orthodox believers, Janullatos was 
reported to have said that he had taken advice from God, who 
ordered him not to hurry in such affairs, i.e., the ordaining of 
Albanian Orthodox priests. 
  Petrit Bidoshi, chairman of the Committee for the Protection 
of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, informed those 
present at the meeting that Janullatos has maintained the same 
stance toward the demand to ordain the priest Arian Koja from 
Tirana. 
  Bidoshi said that both Orthodox priests from Elbasan and 
Tirana have high theological backgrounds and, according to him, 
they should be appointed as soon as possible. But Janullatos's 
stance in this case runs counter to his own religious mission, 
Bidoshi stressed. 
  For the intellectuals present and all the believers who 
filled the hall, these two cases were sufficient argument for 
the meeting to conclude that the conditions had been created to 
terminate Greek Archbishop Janullatos's temporary stay in 
Albania.

  [Text] As we have already reported, President Zhelev this 
morning invited representatives of the parliamentary groups to a 
meeting to discuss the political situation in the country. Only 
Stefan Savov [leader of the Union of Democratic Forces 
parliamentary group] showed up for this meeting. 
  At lunchtime President Zhelev met with Professor Nikolay 
Vasilev and Georgi Kostov, representatives of the NSD [New 
Alliance for Democracy], and with Ruslan Semerdzhiev and Ivan 
Pushkarov of the Assembly for Democracy [SD]. At the meeting 
they discussed possible ways out of the present political 
situation. President Zhelev suggested that a definite date 
should be fixed for holding early parliamentary elections, 
which, in his view, should take place at the end of September or 
the beginning of October. Once this date had been determined, 
the political forces should reach an agreement on electing a 
government. During this period parliament should concentrate on 
passing the most urgent economic legislation. Two months before 
the date fixed for the elections, the government should become a 
caretaker and start preparing for early parliamentary elections. 
  President Zhelev also explained his views on the way out of 
the present political situation with Aleksandur Tomov, GOR 
[Civic Alliance for the Republic] leader. As Tomov said a few 
minutes ago after the meeting had ended, they discussed the 
possibility of signing an agreement on early parliamentary 
elections within the next 10 days and of ensuring a smooth 
transitional period until the elections are held.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev </F>
in Sofia on 20 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots: During the last few days a farce 
has developed in Bulgaria that poses a threat to the foundations 
of parliamentarianism. Guided by personal and party interests, 
many deputies have involved themselves in lobbying machinations 
and bargaining that are well on the way to finally destroying 
the people's trust in the institutions of state. I do not have 
the right to judge anyone, but I am convinced that democracy, 
apart from merely being a form of procedure, also means a sense 
of responsibility, which some people have forgotten. The 
deepening political crisis has led to a complete paralysis of 
state life. In my view, we can extract ourselves from this 
situation only with the determination of all the responsible 
political forces in the country. 
  This conviction led me to invite the chairmen of the 
parliamentary groups to a meeting. Yesterday and today I held 
talks with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov; with 
Stefan Savov, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Union 
of Democratic Forces [SDS]; with representatives of the NSD [New 
Alliance for Democracy] and the Independence parliamentary 
group, Georgi Kostov, Nikolay Vasilev, and Ivan Pushkarov; and 
with Aleksandur Tomov, chairman of the GOR [Civic Alliance for 
the Republic]. For reasons outside my control, no meetings took 
place with Nora Ananieva, parliamentary group leader for the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] and its coalition, or with Ahmed 
Dogan, leader of the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] 
parliamentary group. 
  I will now propose to the nation what I proposed to the 
politicians: the reaching of an agreement between the 
parliamentary forces on early elections. The agreement should 
define the following: 
  First, the exact date of the elections. 
  Second, it should guarantee the passing of laws that will 
ensure the conclusion of the agreement on our foreign debt and 
create conditions for carrying through real reforms. 
  Third, the agreement should lead to the formation of a 
government that will enjoy the confidence of all the 
parliamentary forces, guarantee responsible government in the 
pre-election period, guarantee the fairness of the elections, 
and continue the reforms that have begun. 
  If such an agreement is concluded and such a government 
elected, I shall assume the obligation to entrust this 
government with the additional task of carrying out the 
functions of a caretaker government during the final two months 
preceding the elections. I hope that this will put an end to 
the dirty speculations concerning the role of a future caretaker 
cabinet and will enable us to emerge from the crisis, because 
what we are now putting at risk is not merely the instability of 
one government or another, of some parliament or other, but 
faith in parliamentarianism and democracy. 
  Dear compatriots, I want to believe that the parliamentary 
forces will find the courage, responsibility, and goodwill to 
conclude such an agreement on early elections, an agreement for 
preserving democracy and parliamentarianism. However, at the 
ballot box the decision lies with you.

  [Text] A short time ago the Council of Ministers Press 
Center disseminated the view of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov on 
the debates in the National Assembly and the tasks facing 
parliament during the next few days. 
  The prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria declared once 
again that the government has invested and continues to invest 
much effort in maintaining a parliamentary majority that will 
support the cabinet, without any change to its formula of a 
cabinet of experts entrusted with addressing the most important 
national tasks: combating inflation, fighting crime, settling 
the foreign debt, and other priority tasks. 
  However, with great regret, Prime Minister Berov noted that 
changes have evidently occurred in the positions held by the 
parliamentary groups, which until now have supported the 
cabinet. The prime minister intends to attempt once again to 
achieve a unification of the parliamentary groups that are now 
in opposition to one another, so as to conclude the most 
important tasks on which work has begun, which any Bulgarian 
Government is bound to complete without fail. If the prime 
minister fails to achieve this before 25 May, he will consider 
that his mission of preserving political equilibrium in the 
country has been exhausted. He is firmly convinced that unless 
this is achieved, Bulgaria is on the road to early parliamentary 
elections.

  [Text] The Executive Committee of the KNSB [Confederation 
of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria] decided today to call 
off mass strike actions until parliament reaches a final 
decision on the fate of the Lyuben Berov cabinet, but the KNSB 
structures are to remain ready to strike. 
  The protests that are planned to begin on 25 May in various 
parts of the country are to be supported by KNSB union 
federations and regional structures. This decision was adopted 
after the Executive Committee had reached the view that at the 
moment no parliamentary majority exists and that the country has 
no legitimate government able to adopt responsible decisions.

<F P=106> ["Resolutions of the Sixth National Conference of the Union </F>
of Democratic Forces"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 1. The only real solution to the deepening 
political and economic crisis in the country is to hold early 
parliamentary elections. 
  2. It is impossible in the present parliament to formulate 
positive goals for carrying through the reform. The SDS [Union 
of Democratic Forces] unequivocally declares that any attempt to 
extend the life of the government or to form a new government 
within the term of this parliament will lead to irreparable and 
disastrous consequences for the country. 
  3. The SDS links its participation in the work of the 
present parliament with the fate of the government. If the 
government is retained or altered or a new one formed, the SDS 
National Coordinating Council and parliamentary group are to 
take immediate actions to provoke early parliamentary elections 
-- rallies, marches, demonstrations, a boycott of parliament, 
and civil disobedience within the law. 
  4. When candidates are proposed for seats in the National 
Assembly, it is essential to observe the principles of party 
political responsibility, eligibility for election, and the 
effectiveness of the candidates. 
  On the basis of the resolutions of the SDS's Fifth National 
Conference and the proposals made by the Sixth National 
Conference, the National Coordinating Council is to draft, in 
collaboration with the local coordinating councils and full SDS 
members, mechanisms to ensure that the above principles are 
observed in the best possible way and to prevent any new 
substitution of the electoral vote. 
  The following persons may not be proposed in the lists of 
SDS 
parliamentary candidates, be members of the National 
Coordinating Council and municipal councils, or be proposed by 
the SDS as mayors and oblast administrators: sons and daughters 
of active fighters against fascism and capitalism, of members of 
the Politburo or Central Committee of the BCP [Bulgarian 
Communist Party], of communist generals and colonels, and of 
secretaries of BSP okrug and city committees, or persons who 
have applied for membership in the BCP. 
  5. The following new Paragraph No. 2 is added to Article 1 
of the SDS Statute: 
  The leading political organs of the SDS are the national 
conference and the National Coordinating Council, whose 
decisions are binding on all SDS structures and institutions. 
  Sentences two and three in Article 36 of the SDS Statute are 
deleted. (Editor's note: "He has the right to postpone the 
adoption of decisions by the National Coordinating Council that 
have to be implemented by the SDS parliamentary group until they 
are discussed by the parliamentary group, until the next meeting 
of the National Coordinating Council. In the event of any 
differences in views, the decision is adopted following joint 
discussion of the issue between the National Coordinating 
Council and the SDS parliamentary group.") 
  6. The aim of the SDS to increase to the maximum its 
influence in Bulgarian society and politics remains the leading 
trend in its development. The chief criterion governing the 
attitude of the SDS to other democratic formations is the idea 
of real decommunization of society.

radiation situation in the country. The defect will be repaired 
by the end of the week. Even with the No. 1 reactor out of

  [Text] Geza Jeszenszky is worried that the Socialist Party 
[MSZP], which is leading in the elections, might want to change 
the direction of foreign policy. In a statement to a Ukrainian 
paper, the foreign minister mentioned as an example the fact 
that the Socialists, contrary to the six-party agreement, are 
urging a referendum about joining NATO. Geza Jeszenszky also 
criticized the MSZP for thinking that relations more balanced 
than the present ones are possible with Romania, Slovakia, and 
Serbia. According to the Hungarian Democratic Forum government 
member, the political directions and minority policies of these 
countries preclude rapprochement.

  [Text] The Szonda Ipsos Media and Opinion Poll Research 
Institute made the following forecast regarding the second round 
of parliamentary elections to be held on 29 May: 
  The most probable national participation in the elections 
will be around 50 percent (among the people eligible to vote). 
  Both the participation proportion and the number of votes 
per 
candidates could differ considerably from the expected figures 
if an event takes place in the remaining time that considerably 
affects the evaluation of the political parties that enjoy 
greater support, namely the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. [MSZP Chairman] Gyula 
Horn's car accident before the first round of elections was such 
an event. On the basis of this, it is possible that the current 
chances of the MSZP might change considerably if the public's 
ideas connected with the aforementioned accident become 
stronger. Such a change would also affect the chances of 
parties that can still count on obtaining individual mandates. 
  At the time of this forecast, namely 10 days before the 
elections, it is not yet fully known who will really run in the 
second round from among the candidates who made it to the second 
round. Withdrawals, the parties' call to the voters of 
candidates that have withdrawn from the race, and the campaign 
finish will also have an effect on the real election results and 
the differences in forecasts. 
  In its first prognosis regarding the second round of the 
elections, the Szonda Ipsos took into consideration the results 
of the first round as well as the trends and connections 
emerging from the opinion polls of recent months. We mainly 
considered the following factors among the research data: the 
voters' readiness to participate in the elections and the 
firmness and nature of their party affiliation; secondary 
preferences; the viewpoints and motivations of choosing among 
various individual candidates; the extent to which the 
candidates are known and their evaluation; and the personal 
factors that affect their chances. We modelled the voters' 
expected attitude in the second round of elections by comparing 
the composition of remaining candidates in various districts, 
the results they achieved in the first round, and the main 
parameters that determined the voters' decisions. 
  According to the results based on the aforementioned 
considerations and the stipulations of the electoral law, we 
calculated the mandates of the national list according to the 
parties. The parliamentary mandates obtained in the first round 
and the most probable individual and compensatory mandates show 
the expected composition of the new parliament according to our 
current knowledge. 
  In addition to its two mandates already obtained, the winner 
of the first round, the MSZP, is leading in 158 electoral 
districts and it will also emerge as the strongest parliamentary 
party after the second round. However, it will be unable to 
preserve its advantage in some of the electoral districts and 
turn this advantage into mandates. The extent of this drop is 
decisive regarding the possibility of obtaining the majority of 
parliamentary mandates or having to share two-thirds of the 
mandates with the SZDSZ. Regarding the possibility of an 
absolute majority, 10 days before the elections we cannot 
provide a firm answer, because the most probable figure of the 
MSZP mandates falls precisely on the critical border line. This 
means that, at the moment, we see equal chances of the MSZP 
falling behind the 50 percent by a few percent, and crossing 
this border by a few percent. Regarding the two-thirds border 
equally important for coalition and legislation considerations, 
the chances seem to be clear: There is a high probability of 
the MSZP and SZDSZ filling up at least two-thirds of the 
parliamentary places. 
  At the same time, we must also consider the fact that a 
large 
number of citizens have double preferences, their party 
commitment is generally loose, and their current approach to the 
stronger parties has proved more unstable than previously. Just 
like before the first round, this time too, various media 
effects lead to greater uncertainty and unpredictability than 
usual in the voters' decisions. Along with all this, it is 
justified that, together with a prognosis of the election 
results, we should provide the realistic values of difference 
from the most probable values. 
  The electoral law bans the publication of opinion poll 
results eight days before the elections; therefore, we will make 
our next forecast public on 29 May, immediately after the 
closure of the polls.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "According to the Modus, 33 Percent </F>
Wish Horn To Be Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] Modus Inc., which is actually not very well known 
for its political public opinion polls, has provided a flash 
report to the newspapers. 
  On 16-17 May, after the 1994 parliamentary elections, the 
Modus Economic and Social Marketing Advisory Inc. prepared a 
flash report on possible prime ministers. The survey was 
effected in four cities (Budapest, Miskolc, Gyor, and Szeged) on 
a sample of 520 people. The sample represented the full 
Hungarian population over the age of 18 according to gender, 
age, and education. 
  Modus was trying to find out whom people would welcome as 
prime minister. All the questioned people were aware that 
parliamentary elections had taken place on 8 May. The party 
preferences of the sample basically corresponded to the results 
of the first round of elections. The small differences compared 
to the first round can be attributed to the fact that the survey 
did not extend to all types of settlements. 
  In reply to the question "if the decision was up to you, to 
which politicians would you give the prime ministerial post," 
the following five names were mentioned in the first five 
places: Gyula Horn [Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] 33.1 
percent, Gabor Kuncze [Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] 23.7 
percent, Peter Boross [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 9.4 percent, 
Jozsef Torgyan [Independent Smallholders Party] 6.5 percent, and 
Viktor Orban [Federation of Young Democrats] 6.5 percent. It 
is interesting that, of the MSZP's voters, 84.9 percent would 
like to see Horn as prime minister, and 73.1 percent of the 
SZDSZ's voters would like Kuncze as prime minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F>
Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary, MSZOSZ, by Gabor Karsai; 
place and date not given: "Pragmatism Instead of Liberalism? -- 
Pact Psychology -- Interview With MSZOSZ Chairman Sandor Nagy, 
Member of the New, Probably Government Party MSZP Parliamentary 
Group"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Karsai] In the autumn of 
1993 you considered it possible to form an election alliance 
with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP], the Republic Party, the 
National Democratic Federation [NDSZ], and the Agrarian 
Federation, but not with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], 
the MSZP's probable coalition partner. How will you find your 
place in the coalition of the two government parties that 
advocate a liberal economic policy? 
  [Nagy] I can only tell you my personal opinion, which does 
not -- and should not -- influence the MSZP's decision in 
choosing its partner. 
  As a trade union leader, I would not be happy if it was 
possible to describe the government's economic policy with one 
attribute, namely liberalism, because, in a simplified way, this 
would mean that the strong remain functioning while the weak 
fail. It would lead to conflicts if all this was even amplified 
by shock therapy ideas. As a matter of fact, in my view, the 
MSZP's economic policy is characterized by pragmatism rather 
than liberalism. 
  [Karsai] I assume that the acceptance of the MSZP's 
nevertheless liberal-type economic policy concept prepared by 
Laszlo Bekesi was a condition of you becoming a deputy candidate. 
  [Nagy] I have said many times that this program can be 
welcomed by the trade unions -- naturally, together with the 
employment, welfare policy, and other programs linked to it. At 
the same time, no one asked me to countersign every line of this 
program for the trade unions, as if giving a blank check to the 
future government. 
  [Karsai] The MSZP finally accepted the fifth version of the 
Bekesi program. To what extent are the amendments a result of 
the agreement made with the National Federation of Trade Unions 
in Hungary [MSZOSZ]? 
  [Nagy] We did not participate in the detailed preparation of 
the program, but, naturally, our views were known to the MSZP's 
leaders. During the debates within the MSZP, the formulations 
that are more attractive to us were included in the program. 
For example, the final version is more socially sensitive to 
the problems of the groups of society that are in the worst 
position and it sees the reduction of unemployment as a direct 
goal. [passage omitted] 
  [Karsai] Do you agree with Bekesi's statement that it is 
impossible to give social democratic answers to the problems 
under the circumstances of the current crisis? 
  [Nagy] I do. This period is not good for social democratic 
values; nevertheless, they have to be represented. The most 
serious social problems have to be remedied. 
  [Karsai] Do you accept that the main goal of the next few 
years is to stop the deterioration of the financial balance and 
then to improve it? 
  [Nagy] It is possible that we have to say this because of 
the timing of the tasks. However, it is more attractive for me 
to say that we have to strive for establishing the conditions 
for a financial balance and a boom, for improving the 
employment, reducing inflation, and handling the social 
problems. More precisely, for optimizing these partially 
contradictory goals. 
  [Karsai] According to Bekesi, the reform if state finances 
will attract an annual 4 to 5 percent reduction of real incomes, 
and some half of this could be compensated for. What do these 
figures mean to you? 
  [Nagy] According to the MSZP's economic policy program, for 
the majority of society, the reform of state finances has to be 
accompanied by full compensation. If the government does not 
consider this feasible, then it will have to discuss this with 
the trade unions. It would be too early to talk about numbers. 
It is certain that, in our view, it is indispensable to stop 
the reduction of the real value of incomes within a foreseeable 
time and to increase the real value of the lowest pensions. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Karsai] In the autumn of 1993, the MSZOSZ published a 
statement on privatization in which it primarily emphasized the 
need for a more marked regard for employment considerations. Do 
you really feel that unemployment within the doors has already 
ceased to exist in the case of enterprises facing privatization, 
and they now structurally match the market requirements, in 
other words, further dismissals are unavoidable? 
  [Nagy] We are against the current privatization practice 
that strives for maximizing the -- later actually wasted -- 
revenue, ignoring the future fate of the enterprises. 
Therefore, in our view, buyers who guarantee an employment 
level and the increase of capital should be given preference. 
  [Karsai] On the one hand, I do not believe that buyers 
paying cash are generally not interested in the efficient future 
operation of the enterprises. On the other hand, the broader 
access of employees to ownership, which you also require, 
contradicts your concern about the future of the enterprises. 
The employees usually do not have any money to invest, and the 
delay of possibly necessary dismissals might lead to the 
bankruptcy of the whole enterprise. 
  [Nagy] It is a misunderstanding to conclude that we are in 
favor of dominant ownership by the employees just because we 
support the employees' share program. In our view, it is more 
important for the enterprise to be in good hands and for the 
people to get well-paid jobs than for them to become owners. At 
the same time, we would find it expedient if the relevant 
industry's trade union representatives could be present at 
privatization decisions. Many misunderstandings could be 
avoided purely by exchanging information. [passage omitted] 
  [Karsai] In recent months the current opposition parties 
and the MSZOSZ have advocated an economic-social pact. In your 
view, is there any difference in the issues the various trade 
unions wish to agree on? 
  [Nagy] At the moment we can only talk about initial and 
rather fluid intentions. Obviously, the economic problems we 
have already mentioned -- namely nominal wages and pensions, 
inflation, taxes, the burdens of the reform of state 
administration, welfare benefits, and a predictable real value 
of incomes for many years -- will all be topics. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 21 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
agreed Saturday to pull 150 armed policemen out of the eastern 
town of Gorazde, a month after the expiry of a NATO deadline 
ordering the complete withdrawal of Serb forces from the town. 
Under the agreement, due to come into force at 6:00 p.m. (1600 
GMT) Sunday, the armed Serbs will pull back from a UN-declared 
three kilometre (two mile) exclusion zone around central 
Gorazde, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said here. 
  "The Bosnian Serb forces have pledged to redeploy all armed 
personnel outside the exclusion zone," Annink said. The Serbs 
also agreed to "cease all hostilities around Gorazde" and 
guaranteed UNPROFOR "complete freedom of movement" in the zone, 
he said. UNPROFOR said 150 armed Serbs had remained in Gorazde 
after the expiry of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
ultimatum at the end of April. Serb sources said the men had 
remained as "policemen" to protect the town's Serb population. 
Moslem sources said they were soldiers who had changed uniform.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 23 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb commanders 
failed to pull 150 armed policemen out of the eastern town of 
Gorazde this weekend, as agreed, the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) reported Monday [23 May]. The Serbs' failure to 
abide by the Gorazde accord could torpedo the resumption of 
peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, obervers warned. 
  "There is no change in the deployment inside the 
three-kilometre (two-mile) total exclusion zone," UNPROFOR 
spokesman Rob Annink said Monday, referring to a UN-declared 
exclusion zone around the valley town, which is populated mostly 
by Moslems, including thousands of refugees from Serb "ethnic 
cleansing" of nearby villages. 
  "It is a disappointment that the Bosnian Serb army did not 
react to the agreement," Major Annink said. 
  Under the agreement signed Saturday between Lieutenant 
General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, 
and Bosnian Serb military leader Manojlo Milovanovic, the Serbs 
were to redeploy the 150 men outside the exclusion zone by 6:00 
p.m. (1600 GMT) Sunday. The Serbs also pledged to guarantee the 
UNPROFOR freedom of movement within a 20-kilometre (12-mile) 
heavy weapons exclusion zone around Gorazde. 
  Annink said the Serbs told UN military observers that they 
would not be granted freedom of movement within the exclusion 
zone until 570 Serbs were allowed to leave the town and the 
mainly Moslem Bosnian army withdrew from a hill overlooking 
Gorazde. He said the overall situation in Gorazde was stable 
Sunday with Bosnian Serb and Bosnian army troop movements 
reported northwest of the town.

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 May (TANJUG) -- The UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] command in former Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
officially informed the republic of Srpska army's main 
headquarters that the Muslim side did not sign an annex to the 
agreement on the cease-fire and cessation of hostilities within 
the 3-km zone around Gorazde which was supposed to come into 
effect at 1800 this evening. This was reported by the 
information service of the republic of Srpska army's main 
headquarters late this evening. 
  According to a public statement received by TANJUG, the 
information service points out that the annex to the agreement 
was signed by the republic of Srpska army and UNPROFOR 
representatives but that it cannot be implemented because the 
Muslim side rejected it. "By refusing to sign the agreement 
mentioned above, the Muslims have assumed all responsibility and 
once again confirmed their military option for resolving the 
crisis on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina," the 
statement issued by the information service of the main 
headquarters of the republic of Srpska army said in conclusion.

  [Text] In response to the agreement on the 
demilitarization of the exclusion zone 3 km east of the Drina 
River, which UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the Serbian 
aggressor's side signed on 21 May, the press center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has been authorized to announce the 
following: 
  Representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not take 
part in the signing of the agreement, although an offer was made 
to them. They were not obliged to take part because the 
agreement is not in line with UN Resolution 913 and NATO's 
ultimatum, which clearly specify the obligations assumed by 
UNPROFOR and the Serbian aggressor side. This makes it clear to 
UNPROFOR representatives that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will 
be ready to discuss the implementation of UN Resolution 913 and 
NATO's ultimatum in the future. 
  The situation in the field shows that the Serb aggressors 
have not fulfilled all obligations specified in the above 
mentioned documents. Among other things, they have not 
withdrawn military units and weapons from the 3-km exclusion 
zone around the town center. Furthermore, the aggressors' heavy 
weapons are still in the 20-km zone around Gorazde and are not 
under UNPROFOR's control. There are one tank, six howitzers, 
seven [word indistinct], one self-propelled weapon, one 100-mm 
cannon, and three antiaircraft guns in the 20-km zone. The 
complete evacuation of the wounded has not been made possible, 
and living conditions of the residents in the protected area 
have not improved. 
  We stress that representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army 
[break in reception] are ready to discuss the resolution of the 
situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields and other 
decisions that will be based on UN and NATO resolutions.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- BBC radio on Monday 
quoted U.N. sources as saying that the Bosnian Serbs are fully 
respecting the ceasefire agreement for Gorazde, Muslim enclave 
in southeast Bosnia, which the Muslims refused to sign. The 
representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) on Saturday signed an annex to the agreement on 
a ceasefire and the cessetion of hostilities in the region of 
Gorazde. But the Muslims refused to sign it, as confirmed by 
the UNPROFOR Command for Bosnia. 
  In a program monitored in Belgrade, BBC radio cited an 
unnamed senior U.N. official in Sarajevo that the respect of the 
ceasefire in Gorazde `enables the deployment of the U.N. troops 
in areas from where the Serbs have withdrawn.' The only 
potential problem is the attempt of the local Muslims to use the 
withdrawl of the Serb forces and sieze the regions they 
previously controlled, which is not allowed under the relevant 
U.N. resolutions, the radio said. 
  It quoted UNPROFOR as saying that armed Bosnian Serb police 
has pulled out of the northern part of Gorazde to 3 km from the 
exclusion zone, while the remainder of the Serbs in the eastern 
parts should withdraw within the next 24 hours. The Bosnian 
Serbs in late April pulled out their heavy weapons to 20 km and 
the infantry to 3 km away from the centre of Gorazde with the 
aim of reaching a peaceful solution to the crisis caused by the 
Muslims who launched a major offensive from this 
`U.N.-designated safe area' in March. 
  Only the Bosnian Serb police remained in the Serb villages 
near Gorazde to allow the local inhabitants to safely return to 
their homes. Some 15,000 Muslims from Gorazde, which should 
have been demilitarized last May, in late March launched an 
offensive on Serb territories. In the face of a total defeat 
from a Serb counterattack, NATO on April 10-11 bombed Serb 
positions close to this town.

  [Text] Brcko, May 22 (TANJUG) -- Positions of Bosnian Serbs 
in northern Bosnia were attacked on Sunday [22 May] by Bosnian 
Croats and Moslems, the Bosnian Serb army (VRS) sources 
reported. The forces of Bosnian Croats from the area of the 
Croat enclave of Orasje in the Sava valley northwest of Brcko 
opened fire from mortars and infantry weaponry. The Croat 
attack caused no effects on the Serb side and the Serb units did 
not respond. 
  The forces of Bosnian Serbs also did not respond to fire 
opened towards them on Sunday by Moslem troops in a location 8 
km southwest of the Serb town of Brcko in the Sava valley. A 
narrow strip of Serb territory in northern Bosnia which links 
the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb republic 
(R.S.) is only a few kilometers wide near Brcko. 
  The Moslems have been for weeks amassing their troops to the 
south, and the Bosnian Croats to the north of the corridor in an 
attempt to cut it. The Republic of Croatia has also been 
concentrating its troops on the northern side of the corridor, 
on the Croatian bank of the Sava. Both Moslems and Croats have 
for days continued with offensive actions against the Serb 
positions and settlements in spite of the presence of U.N. 
observers. Brcko was shelled in such an action on Saturday 
evening, when 5 civilians were wounded, including a one-year-old 
girl. 
  While Sunday was completely calm in Sarajevo, at the far 
west 
of Bosnia, in the Cazin Krajina region, inter-Moslem clashes 
between the followers of the radical Moslem authorities in 
Sarajevo and those of Fikret Abdic do not stop. Abdic advocates 
peace with the Serb and Croats. The Moslem Radio Sarajevo said 
that Abdic's followers, who proclaimed the autonomous province 
of western Bosnia, from early morning were opening fire from 
infantry and artillery weapons along all lines on the positions 
of the forces loyal to Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.

  [Text] Brcko, May 22 (TANJUG) -- Colonel Slavko Guzvic of 
the Bosnian Serb Army on Sunday insisted with the command of the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to publish an official report about the attack on the Serb town 
of Brcko in northern Bosnia on Saturday [21 May]. A team of the 
U.N. military observers in Brcko, headed by British Captain Sean 
Fawcett, on Saturday inspected the scene of the attack and 
established from where it had come, Colonel Guzvic told TANJUG. 
  While inspecting the place where the first shell had landed, 
Captain Fawcett and his team found the remnants of a rocket 
fired from a multiple rocket launcher which had visible Croatian 
Army markings on it. Five people were seriously wounded, 
including a one year-old girl, in the simulataneous shelling of 
Brcko from the Croat-held village of Vucilovac eight kilometres 
west of Brcko and from the territory of neighbouring Croatia. 
  Brcko is situated at the neck of the strategic corridor 
along 
the Sava river which links the western and the eastern parts of 
the Bosnian Serb republic. The material damage from the latest 
attack is considerable. 
  Captain Fawcett declined to comment on the attack and said 
he 
would submit a detailed report on it to his command.

  [Text] In the Sarajevo area the aggressor violated the 
cease-fire today with small arms fire and light artillery. He 
fired from Nedzarici at Mojmilo and Dobrinja, from Brekin Potok 
at Kosevo stadium and Jezero, and with an antiaircraft gun and 
machine gun from (Orlovac) at the Kosevo stadium and Grdonj, 
while an M-84 machine gun was firing indiscriminately from 
Kromolj at Brekin Potok and Pionirska Dolina. 
  By the way, in the 100 days since the [NATO] ultimatum, the 
Serb aggressor has violated the cease-fire exactly 1,375 times. 
The consequence of this is 11 killed and 106 wounded members of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps. 
  Today started on the Ilijas front with artillery attacks by 
the chetniks. One tank and three howitzers from (Ubare) and 
mortar batteries from Srednje fired at Korita and Jasen. Two 
howitzers from (Medojevici), and a tank and howitzer from 
(Nabozici) fired all day at Jasen and Meskovac. Infantry 
attacks followed. On two occasions the chetniks attempted to 
break through our defense lines at Jasen and (Polom), but 
without any success. In these attacks the aggressor suffered 
serious losses, with about 20 chetniks killed and a number of 
others put out of action. Despite the serious losses the 
chetniks did not abandon the attacks. They had attempted a 
further three breakthroughs at Jasen by late afternoon, while 
other parts of the front were exposed to artillery attacks. 
These are still under way but with reduced intensity. 
  This has been a statement by the 1st Corps Information 
Service.

<F P=106> [by Pascal Barollier] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, May 20 (AFP) -- Sarajevo marked its 100th 
day of a ceasefire to the sound of steady gunfire Friday. UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Rob Annink noted that 
between 100 and 200 violations of the truce were recorded daily. 
  The 100-day anniversary of the ceasefire agreement signed 
February 10 by Bosnia-Herzegovina's warring parties was greeted 
overnight Thursday with "the usual ceasefire violations" in the 
capital consisting this time of heavy machine-gun fire, the 
United Nations said. 
  The shooting lasted for more than an hour in the capital's 
Serb- held downtown neighborhood of Grbavica. Major Annink 
added, however, that the violations did not amount to a breach 
of the 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone 
imposed by the United Nations around Sarajevo. He said the 
ceasefire violations were perpetrated with "rocket launchers, 
hand grenades, mines, machine-guns and small arms," which, he 
added, "do not pose a direct threat to the city." But although 
the city itself may not be threatened by the continuous 
violations, several of its residents seek treatement for bullet 
wounds at local hospitals each day. Soldiers from both camps -- 
the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army and Bosnian Serbs -- are also 
killed daily by sniper fire. 
  Although the UNPROFOR says that the exclusion zone 
forbidding 
heavy weapons within a 20-kilometre (12-mile) radius around 
Sarajevo is generally being respected, it admits to various 
violations in that area. Annink said the Serbs had deployed six 
heavy guns inside the zone along with several tanks which were 
not placed under UN control at various collection centers. The 
Serbs managed to sneak one of the tanks into Grbavica earlier 
this month as it was being transported from Bosnian Serb 
headquarters at Pale. 
  Annink said the UNPROFOR did not believe the heavy weapons 
were a threat to the city and preferred "negotiation to force" 
in resolving the matter. 
  In other developments Friday, Annink said the Bosnian Army 
was continuing its offensive along several fronts in central 
Bosnia. He said UN peacekeepers counted 140 explosions Thursday 
in the region of Kladanj, located midway between Sarajevo and 
the northern town of Tuzla. 
  The situation was also tense in the regions of Travnik and 
Turbe where Annink said the Bosnian Army burned a Roman Catholic 
church. He did not have any further details on the incident, 
but Roman Catholicism is the religion of Bosnia's Croats, who 
engaged in bitter fighting aginst Moslem troops earlier in the 
war but recently reached an agreement to set up a Moslem-Croat 
federation in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  The latest fighting came as several Western countries 
threatened this week to pull their troops out of ex-Yugoslavia 
unless there was a breakthrough in the peace process. France, 
Spain and Britain, together supply around 35 percent of the 
33,253 UNPROFOR troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] The Muslim-Croat peace agreement is mostly being 
respected in central Bosnia. However, HINA [Croatian news 
agency] has learned from the command of the HVO [Croat Defense 
Council] Vitez operational zone that certain events in the field 
warn about resistance to the peace agreement and the 
establishment of the Bosniak-Croat federation. An official 
government delegation of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, 
headed by Vice Prime Minister Perica Jukic, was last night 
harassed and threatened at gunpoint between Gornji Vakuf and 
Novi Travnik, an area under the control of the armed forces of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Another official HVO delegation was stopped 
and mistreated in the same area yesterday.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 21 (TANJUG) -- Tension between Croats 
and Moslems in northern Herzegovina is rising again, with the 
two sides exchanging accusations for a series of armed 
incidents. Two Bosnian Croat soldiers were shot dead on a local 
road northeast of Prozor on Friday, Croatian Radio on Saturday 
quotes U.N. sources as saying. The Moslems, on the other side, 
say the Croats are to blame for renewed tension between the two 
sides. Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo says that Bosnian Croat 
forces on Saturday sprayed Moslem positions in the Neretvica 
River valley with small arms fire. 
  The same source reports heavy Croat troop concentrations in 
the area of Doljani near Jablanica, which serves as a buffer 
zone between the Moslem and Croat troops in northern Herzegovina. 
  Bosnian Croats and Moslems, erstwhile allies in the war 
against the local Serbs, first started fighting each other in 
northern Herzegovina in October 1992. The conflicts escalated 
in full-size war in the spring of 1993. 
  After a year of fierce fighting for territories with mixed 
populations in southern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Moslems and Croats yielded to U.S. pressure and on March 18 
signed an agreement to form a binational federation. In 
practice, however, the two sides have renewed hostilities and 
their federation agreement seems to be nothing but a dead letter.

  [Text] Banja Luka, May 21 (TANJUG) -- A mosque in the 
Moslem settlement Grbavica in the central Bosnian town of Vitez 
was levelled with the ground on Friday evening, on the eve of 
the Moslem religious holiday of Kurban Bairam, the Croat radio 
of Herzeg-Bosnia reported on Saturday [21 May]. 
  The destroyed mosque was in the area controlled by the 
Bosnian Croats Army (HVO). There are no details about 
perpetrators but an investigation is expected, the announcement 
said. `This terrible incident, which happened on the eve of the 
major Moslem religious holiday of Kurban Bairam, has 
deteriorated the already tense relations between Moslems and 
Croats in the area of Vitez,' the Croat Radio said. Only a few 
hours before explosive was planted, Moslem troops were 
celebrating the coming of Kurban Bairam by shooting on the 
positions of a HVO brigade in the area of Vitez, the radio said. 
  The Bosnian Croats and Moslems were fighting fiercly from 
last spring (over territories with mixed population in central 
and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina) to early February, when, under 
strong U.S. pressure, they signed an accord on their federation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina supposed to grow into a confederation with 
neighbouring Croatia. 
  Relations between Croats and Moslems are, however, still 
very 
strained, and clashes and incidents do happen increasingly 
often. Apart from Vitez, mosques had been destroyed by Bosnian 
Croats in Zepca, Kiseljak, western Mostar, and Livno, all in the 
Croat republic of Herzeg Bosnia.

  [Text] A joint statement issued by the Joint Command of 
the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council 
[HVO] points out that the work of the Joint Command so far is 
characterized by a high degree of accord on the most significant 
matters on which the successful establishment of peace between 
Bosniaks and Croats depends. 
  Members of the Joint Command completely concur in 
assessments 
that armed conflicts between the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the Croatian Defense Council are not in the interest of Bosniaks 
and Croats and that significant results have already been 
achieved in implementing the Washington agreement, but that the 
basic problem lies in the fact that [word indistinct] of the 
Army of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council in 
central Bosnia and Herzegovina have the character of armed 
conflicts of the formations. There are identical assessments 
regarding the need to begin work on bringing the forces of the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council onto 
positions that would mean a real peace between Bosniaks and 
Croats. This would be achieved by deploying units in the 
barracks, training grounds, and the like. 
  Members of the Joint Command are also in agreement about 
adopting measures that would improve the situation in Mostar, as 
well measures to establish free movement along all roads under 
the control of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian 
Defense Council. The greatest attention will be devoted to the 
measures of protecting roads from all forms of threat, 
particularly robbery [word indistinct]. 
  All activities of the Joint Command, in conformity with the 
[word indistinct] built and coordinated assessments, will be 
performed with a view to having the most complete peace possible 
between Bosniaks and Croats, especially to prevent distrust and 
suspicion about the political will for implementing the 
agreements in practice. The readiness to implement the measures 
ensuing from the plan of activity of the Joint Command will be 
the best indicator of the degree [word indistinct] of the 
political will. 
  This is stated in the joint statement by the members of the 
Joint Command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian 
Defense Council signed by Brigadier General Fikret Muslimovic 
and Army General Ante Roso.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 22 (TANJUG) -- The government of the 
Bosnian Croat republic of Herceg-Bosnia [as received] has 
decided to introduce a new currency as of June 1 -- the kuna. 
The kuna, which is the national currency of neighbouring 
Croatia, will replace the Croatian dinar, which has so far been 
in circulation in Herceg-Bosnia too. 
  Despite strong protests, the government in Zagreb has 
decided 
to reintroduce the kuna, the national currency of the Nazi 
puppet independent state of Croatia which existed during World 
War Two. The opponents of the Croatian Government's decision 
argue the kuna will only link Croatia with its infamous Nazi 
past. The Moslem government in Sarajevo has still not reacted 
to Herceg-Bosnia's move. 
  After almost a year of fierce battles, Bosnian Moslems and 
Croats in mid-March yielded to U.S. pressure and signed a 
federation agreement. The constitution of their binational 
state in Bosnia, which should subsequently form a confederation 
with neighbouring Croatia, envisages a single federal currency.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "The Home Guard as a Basis"] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo -- "The Joint Command of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is 
organizing a contemporary type of defense based on the examples 
set forth by the military organization of West European 
countries with the ultimate aim of joining organizations such as 
the `Partnership for Peace'. As a federal army, we could be 
among the first to be accepted into this organization," General 
Ante Roso, HVO representative in the Joint Command of the 
Federation that has recently become operational in Sarajevo, 
told Sarajevo OSLOBODJENJE on Thursday [19 May]. 
  According to General Roso, the Croatian side has proposed 
that the home guard be the basis of the Federation's future 
defense. "In this way, neither would the Croats disarm the 
Bosniaks, nor would the Bosniaks disarm the Croats." The other 
component of the defense system would be the regular army, in 
which 18 to 25 year olds -- male and female -- would serve a 10 
to 12 month term, said General Roso, and added that, for 
example, a student could serve his or her term in some 
institute, because "carrying arms is not the only way to serve 
in the army...." 
  The third component of the Federation's defense would be 
professional brigades for interventions and border units. The 
Joint Command of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in 
Sarajevo is for the time being not making any decisions on 
combat activities, and it does not have the authority to 
directly command the forces. The Command creates conditions for 
maintaining the current cease-fire, the safety of 
communications, and the restoration of trust between people, 
said General Roso.

  [Text] Srbinje, May 22 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Parliament 
President Momcilo Krajisnik said on Sunday that the Bosnian 
Moslems and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina could make agreements 
and tailor the future federation to suit them, but they could 
not do that on Serb ethnic territories. 
  The Serbs would not allow a Moslem-Croat federation to be 
formed on their own land, Krajisnik said in Srbinje (formerly 
Foca) at a local ceremony. The Bosnian Moslems and Croats on 
March 18, without the participation of the Serb side and under 
strong U.S. pressure, signed an accord on a dual federation 
which would later enter a confederation with neighbouring 
Croatia. A federation was set up in this way, with no clearly 
defined territory. 
  Work is in progress on settling the issue of territorial 
division in Bosnia. In Vienna, the Moslems and Croats agreed on 
a proposal allocating 58 per cent of the territories to a 
Moslem-Croat federation and 42 per cent to the Serb side, but 
this was not accepted by the Serbs. According to the prewar 
land registers, the Bosnian Serbs owned 64 per cent and after 
the two-year old war they now control about 70 per cent of the 
Bosnian territory.

  [Text] Novi Sad, 21 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
speaker of the People's Assembly of the Serb republic, said in 
an interview for DNEVNIK of Novi Sad -- to be published tomorrow 
-- that the latest arrangement by the West on the division of 
Bosnia was detrimental to the Serbs. "How else would one 
interpret the 51-49 agreement given that Serbs own 64 percent of 
the entire territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
control even more land than that?, asked Krajisnik. 
  "The proposed percentage could in the future create a real 
chaos with far-reaching consequences, and the Serb republic 
parliament will discuss everything in detail at its next 
session," he announced. 
  The world has finally realized that the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be divided, Krajisnik said, warning that 
the Serb republic would not allow its territorial integrity to 
be disturbed. 
  Commenting on reports of a possible withdrawal of the 
peace-keeping forces, Krajisnik said that the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] should remain in this former Yugoslav 
republic, but that it must adopt a completely neutral stand 
which, unfortunately, has not been the case so far as the 
UNPROFOR has even openly been siding with the Muslims, Krajisnik 
said.

  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 20 (AFP) - Bosnian 
Croat "bandits" have blocked a convoy of about 100 trucks loaded 
with humanitarian food aid south of Sarajevo for the last two 
days, a Bosnian military spokesman said Friday [20 May]. 
Colonel Ekrem Advic said the convoy, with 200 tonnes of food 
supplies, had been heading to the hard-hit Tuzla region in 
northeastern Bosnia. He said the assailants holding it up near 
Grude, south of Sarajevo, were Mafia-like "criminals" and said 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "should get rid of them." 
  The Grude region is a stronghold of Croat extremists who 
back 
Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban. The spokesman said should the 
recent accord for a federation between Croatia and Bosnia be 
applied, the assailants "would face execution." He was 
referring to an agreement reached this month in Washington 
planning for a federation to end conflict between Bosnians and 
Croats, erstwhile allies in Bosnia against the Serbs. The 
accord in time calls for a joint army.

<F P=106> [By Rebecca Maer, PA News] </F>
  [Text] A British Army officer was forced at gunpoint by 
Bosnian Serbs to read a filmed confession which was shown on 
local television, a United Nations spokesman said today. The 
Ministry of Defence [MoD] tonight confirmed details of the 
incident at the notorious Rogatica checkpoint near the Muslim 
town of Gorazde, but said it was not officially releasing the 
name of the officer involved. The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] in former Yugoslavia said the incident happened a 
week ago when Major Tony Randall of the Royal Engineers and five 
soldiers were detained at the checkpoint for 10 hours by 40 
Bosnian Serb troops. 
  Their weapons were taken and they were forced to sit with 
hands on head at gunpoint. Then Major Randall was forced to 
read an apology to the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic of 
Srpska after local troops alleged his convoy failed to stop at 
the checkpoint. They were eventually released unharmed but the 
only confiscated weapon to be returned was the Major's pistol, 
minus ammunition. The confession was screened on local 
Serb-controlled television near Sarajevo on Thursday night and 
was video taped by REUTERS Television. 
  The MoD added that UNPROFOR made an official complaint to 
the 
Bosnian Serb Army and asked for the weapons back. A Ministry 
spokesman said the British convoy, a Land Rover and two lorries, 
passed through an unmanned checkpoint as they left Gorazde 
having obtained prior clearance. 
  The soldiers attempted to make contact with local forces and 
waited 20 minutes but received no response. They then moved on 
to a second point where they were stopped, searched and 
disarmed. The Major was forced to write a statement of apology 
but when this failed to satisfy the Serbs he was made to rewrite 
it and read it out in front of a camera. 
  Reuters quoted Major's "statement" as saying: "I realise by 
my actions I have insulted the Rogatica Brigade, the army of the 
Republic of Srpska and the state of the republic of Srpska." He 
added that "in my rush to get through the checkpoints I was both 
rude and incautious". 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Major Dacre Holloway dismissed the 
dictated apology and said there had been many problems at this 
checkpoint, including the hold-up for almost a week of a convoy 
from French charity Medicins Sans Frontieres. "Our 
understanding is that the Major believed he and his men were in 
danger and the price to pay by writing this statement was 
relatively small," Major Holloway said, adding that it was not 
the first time this had happened to UN forces at checkpoints in 
Bosnia. 
  -- Earlier this month 168 soldiers in the Duke of 
Wellington's Regiment were delayed at the Rogatica checkpoint 
while trying to make their way to Gorazde.

<F P=106> [B.M., Lj.C. report: "Mt. Ozren Remains Serbian"] </F>
  [Text] "Mt. Ozren will remain forever Serbian," were the 
words that Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of 
Srpska, spoke two nights ago in Vozuca, a village from which 
Serbian forces are defending the approach to the mountain's 
southern slopes. 
  Dr. Karadzic was accompanied by General Ratko Mladic, 
commander of the Serb republic army, General Momir Talic, 
commander of the 1st Krajina corps, and Mr. Vasilije, bishop of 
Zvornik-Tuzla. Dr. Karadzic also visited Doboj. 
  In stressing that "Mt. Ozren will remain forever Serbian," 
Dr. Karadzic was effectively denying rumors that the republic of 
Srpska leadership had accepted the surrender of this territory 
to the future Muslim-Croat federation. These rumors about the 
alleged surrender of Mt. Ozren have been particularly widespread 
after the fall of Vijenac, one of the most important strategic 
points on the mountain. Vijenac was captured by the 117 Lukavac 
Brigade of the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army during a brief 
clash, in which most of the members of the Krnjinska Brigade did 
not even try to defend it properly! 
  According to the reports of the Muslim radio of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the capture of Vijenac must have been one of 
the greatest, if not the greatest, victory of Alija 
Izetbegovic's army so far in the war against the Serbian forces. 
The Command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 2nd Corps claims 
that its troops on Vijenac captured 70 and killed 21 fighters of 
the Krnjinska brigade. According to Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army captured a tank, a Bofors, 
eight mortars, several antiaircraft guns and some machine guns. 
  In capturing Vijenac, the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is 
now in a position to attack Serb villages on the eastern slopes 
of Mt. Ozren, particularly Orahovica, Badinovici, and Savicici. 
At the same time, by capturing Vijenac the Muslim 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has removed the pressure from this 
direction from the Serbian forces on Alija Izetbegovic's troops 
in Lukavac, Zivinice, and other places in the Tuzla basin. 
Simultaneously, the Muslim troops have now created the 
conditions for a "spread" in a possible wider attack on Mt. 
Ozren from its southeastern side. 
  Considering that the people of Mt. Ozren had resisted all 
the 
attacks on Vijenac by the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army for two 
years, and that it fell at a time when it was supposed to be 
defended by the Krnjina people, the rumors about surrendering 
this region to Alija Izetbegovic could easily turn Mt. Ozren 
into another Bilogora: To make the people flee the region, and 
the Serbian fighters desert their positions! That would allow 
the Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to achieve more than it has 
achieved in the entire war so far against the republic of Srpska 
army! 
  The Serbian forces did suffer defeat on Vijenac, but the 
loss 
of this significant point does not mean that they have lost Mt. 
Ozren, let alone the war!

<F P=106> [Report by Vlado Trisic from Mt. Majevica front] </F>
  [Text] Muslim forces, supported by the international 
forces, are today again attacking Serbian positions on Mt. 
Majevica with increasing intensity. On two occasions, at 0500 
and 0800, NATO planes made a low altitude flyover, a mere 100 
meters above the woods, and provoked Serbian defense forces, 
which did not respond to the provocations. This seems to have 
been an introduction to yet another attack of the Muslim forces, 
who, from strongholds in Donje Hrasno, the region of the Stolice 
transmitter, and Banj Brdo, showered the area with shells of 
various caliber, at the same time regrouping for infantry 
assaults. 
  The information service of the republic of Srpska army east 
Bosnian corps this afternoon announced that the Muslim forces 
were carrying out an artillery and infantry attack in the area 
of Jablanica and Piper, north of Lopari. The Muslims from 
Horozovina -- southeast of Tuzla -- are targeting ambulances and 
Serbian positions in Banj Brdo with a Broving gun. As we report 
this, and it is now just after 1400, NATO planes have again 
begun carrying out provocations on Mt. Majevica [words 
indistinct] did not cause the Serbian troops to waver in their 
goal to defend their territory from the latest Muslim aggression.

  [Text] The Serbs launched attacks last night and this 
morning from small arms and mortars on eastern defense lines of 
the free Orasje zone [northern Serb corridor]. [Unidentified 
correspondent] We have found out from the Orasje operational 
zone command there were no casualties in this attack, but 
considerable material damage was caused. 
  General Milivoj Petkovic, the Bosnian Croat Army commander, 
is currently visiting the units on Orasje-Samac front. 
  [Begin Petkovic recording] Judging by what we have seen so 
far the people have realized how serious the situation is, and 
both the Army and the people are behaving accordingly. The 
general opinion is that there is no danger to this area, judging 
by what we have seen so far. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The most frequently used word in all reports 
from Bosnian Posavina is the corridor. There is no need to 
explain what it means to the Serbs. But another question arises 
here. 
  [Begin Petkovic recording] What are we waiting for? This is 
the question we are asked everywhere we go. The Army cannot 
raise itself above politics. The Army has to follow political 
decisions and it will behave accordingly. All units here, both 
the Croatian Defense Council's and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 
2nd Corps--the Tuzla Corps--are in a state of full combat 
readiness. I do not think the Serbs have any chance of widening 
the corridor here. Whether we will try to cut it--you will be 
told when the time comes. [end recording]

  [Text] Tonight, on the second anniversary of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina's United Nations membership, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV welcomes Haris Silajdzic, prime 
minister of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. He talks to Enes 
Musabasic. In this program we have selected the prime 
minister's views on UN efforts to put an end to the aggression 
against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] We have demanded that the United 
Nations follow the rules laid down in the UN Charter. Namely, 
it should help. There are [word indistinct] rules in this world 
that should be complied with. Unfortunately, not only have the 
United Nations and the UN Security Council in particular, and 
the five permanent members which for all practical purposes 
formulate its policies, failed to help us but they have made 
things worse for us. Although the international community says 
it does not want to intervene it has already intervened by 
imposing an arms embargo. Hence, having said that the United 
Nations is doing its job today, it is in fact saying that it is 
redressing to a certain degree the historic mistake it had made 
regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina--there is no such precedent. 
  There is no precedent, as far as I know, there has been no 
repeat of the systematic violations of the UN Charter, such as 
in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, when we ask 
the international community to help us we want it to do what it 
should have done a long time ago. Because of these mistakes, 
the arms embargo above all, this intervention in helping the 
aggressor should come to an end. We have lost 200,000 people as 
a result of these mistakes. We have a ruined country and the 
kind of situation you all know too well. Hence, when we demand 
that the international community do something we are not begging 
for charity, but are demanding just a little bit of what belongs 
to us. Nothing can make up for the lost lives and the 
sufferings we have experienced over these two years. [end 
recording] 
  [Musabasic] The very same international community has over a 
long period of time come up with a number of peace proposals, 
mainly based on an ethnic division of our country. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] Europe has found solutions 
appropriate to its own nature, this has to be understood. 
Europe consists of national states, not of multicultural, 
multiethnic societies such as ours. Europe is not 
cosmopolitan--Europe only tolerates minorities. They are 
applying their own model to Bosnia. 
  Europe says it wants to become like Bosnia, but at the same 
time, it allows the model of what it strives to become to be 
destroyed before its eyes. These are the dilemmas Europe is 
facing. As I said, Europe is looking for a solution in 
Bosnia--a solution that would be Europe-like and not a solution 
that we see as a good one. For this reason, the division into 
ethnic groups--although it is quite clear and we have always 
stressed that Bosnia is live tissue and cutting it along ethnic 
lines that have never clearly existed--means war, means 
bloodshed. It is live tissue, which has to bleed when cut along 
imaginary ethnic lines. 
  Despite this, we have up till now failed to persuade Europe 
that this is the case, except for the act of the creation of the 
[Bosniak-Croat] federation, which to a certain extent makes a 
significant contribution toward the solution of the question of 
the restoration of Bosnia. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Serb republic, told SRNA today that "the Serbs 
are ready to start negotiations on the cessation of hostilities 
immediately and without any preconditions" but that they would 
"favors a permanent and not a temporary peace." 
  Commenting on the appeal issued to the Serb and Muslim sides 
last night by Yasushi Akashi, UN secretary general's special 
envoy in former Yugoslavia, calling on the warring sides to 
begin negotiations on a global cessation of hostilities, 
Karadzic said that the Muslim forces ar launching major 
offensive operations along the entire front. 
  "We want the international community to warn the Muslim side 
to stop the attacks because if this does not happen the Serbs 
have a legitimate right to defend and to counterattack," 
Karadzic told SRNA. Karadzic said that he does not know the 
details of Akashi's draft plan for an urgent cessation of 
hostilities, but he added that an earlier draft made by Akashi 
and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin represent a 
good basis for further negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] After half a century, Europe is again facing a 
familiar monster: fascism. And Europe is again behaving in the 
same way and making the same mistake. Its politicians are again 
capitulating and, what is even more pathetic, they are covering 
up the crimes and siding with the criminals [words indistinct]. 
  Half a century ago Chamberlain travelled to Munich to sign 
the shameful agreement that handed Czechoslovakia over to 
Hitler's bloody embrace. His name is written in the pages of 
history in large letters of fear, as a warning to future 
generations that failing to confront fascism can bring only a 
deceptive peace of perhaps a few months, but then claim millions 
of lives. Instead of Chamberlain, we now have Lord Owen, who 
has emulated the former in every respect. Chamberlain would 
most certainly not have dared visit a place from which the Nazis 
had expelled and murdered the population of other nationalities, 
nor would he have held talks with the man who ordered it. With 
his visit to Zvornik and his talks with the demented 
psychiatrist and mass murderer [Radovan Karadzic], Owen has 
desecrated the graves of thousands of Muslims from Zvornik, and 
also the graves of those Serbs who tried to protect their 
neighbors. Having no understanding of Karadzic's tricks, this 
English lord has himself sinned against the victims, depriving 
them of peace even in the next world. These victims left this 
world in 1992 as innocent children would, in the mistaken belief 
that the Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] and civilized Europe would 
never allow any harm to come to them. Those Zvornik people who 
survived, and all other Bosnians, realized after Zvornik whose 
the JNA was, who stood behind it, and with what intentions. 
  With his visit to Zvornik, Lord Owen has revealed the 
essence 
of the European silence in the face of the Bosnian bloodshed. 
In other words, Europe wrote off the people of Zvornik just as 
it did the Czechs before the Second World War. Some in the West 
are still trying to find excuses for Owen and Stoltenberg, in 
the style: Let them be, they are just after the spotlight. 
They have to do something to justify those high salaries of 
theirs [word indistinct]. Their bad name could not be mended 
even if they were to do a complete U-turn. The bad name of 
Europe can be mended only by anti-fascists, and just such a 
movement is beginning to rise. 
  Hemingway went to Spain half a century ago, primarily as a 
fighter against fascism. Bernard-Henri Levy has been touring 
fighters against fascism in Bosnia now, trying to make Europe 
and the world see that a new modern fascism is at work here. He 
has been making films, and he has formed the Party of United 
Europe, which he calls the Sarajevo List. Bosnia is the last 
chance to halt the onslaught of this new fascism and a 
catastrophe that will be incomparably worse that the one 
elicited by Chamberlain, as this time the fascists will have 
nuclear weapons, Levy says. 
  To remind you, Hemingway -- to the detriment of mankind -- 
lost the battle against Chamberlain. Is Levy to suffer the same 
fate? Or perhaps we should believe that Owen's name will be the 
last one in the history of the shameful [word indistinct] of 
Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Andrzej </F>
Jelenski and Marek Kassa on 21 May; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Jelenski] Mr. Prime Minister, we are talking on 
the eve of Peasants Day. 
  [Marek Kassa] It's a 100-year old tradition: Major 
celebrations this year will take place in Raclawice -- and 
Raclawice means Tadeusz Kosciuszko, Bartosz Glowacki, and 
scythe-bearers. Which of those traditions and slogans we are 
discussing have continued to have significance today? 
  [Pawlak] In those years banners carried a slogan: "We feed 
and defend." Today, we write on our banners: "We manage, feed, 
and defend," which somehow reflects the essence of our actions 
today. [passage omitted]. 
  This 200th anniversary of the Kosciuszko insurrection 
coincides with celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the 
peasant movement and the creation of a party that began to work 
in the age of partitions, when prospects of freedom were bleak. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kassa] In your opinion as prime minister and leader of the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL], is there a chance to begin to think 
about the unification of the peasant movement, which continues 
to be split in Poland? 
  [Pawlak] To a large extent, the recent elections have 
prejudged the situation. Integration is taking place at the 
moment but in a different manner. I think that it is important 
that in our actions we seek respect for a different look at the 
future, at the way the peasant movement is organized. In the 
PSL we do try to pay attention to this matter, whereby different 
milieus can have a significant participation in activities and 
decisionmaking. This is connected with a broader cooperation 
with political and unionist milieus. Involvement of all the 
sides is required here. This is also an indicator for those 
politicians who work in rural areas, so that we can interplay 
together in this sphere of essential interests of both the 
countryside and Poland. During my foreign trips, I am often 
struck by the fact that in external relations in many countries 
I encounter an unequivocal stand, irrespective of the fact 
whether it is a government coalition or the opposition. In 
foreign relations they represent one stance. This should teach 
us both in internal and external relations. 
  [Kassa] Your government and you personally were heavily 
criticized for the organization of the 50th anniversary 
celebrations of the battle of Monte Cassino. President Lech 
Walesa said that the organization had failed and the current 
government had a different option. [sentence as heard] In this 
way he indicated that it was no accident that the organization 
of these celebrations was not a success. 
  [Pawlak] I think that we are concentrating on the emotional 
and technical side. I would begin with my own personal 
reflection on the anniversary itself. In my view, Monte Cassino 
shows that you can fight for Poland and for the future in 
different places in the world. [passage omitted] As far as the 
organizational and technical level is concerned, I am glad that 
different milieus became involved and I do not think that this 
pinching of the government should disturb anyone. It is 
important that in addition to what the government organized 
there were independent social initiatives. Everyone should 
become involved in such situations, events, meetings, and 
celebrations which concern our widely understood national 
tradition. We will soon have the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw 
Uprising, and I can say today that I would like to expect such 
activity in organizing it by various milieus but now, at the 
moment, when there is still time to organize many useful 
activities. I would only like to point out to the fact that the 
whole ceremony was organized by the organizational committee 
consisting of different structures and representatives of 
different milieus. The government supported it, first and 
foremost, from the financial side and granted over 3 billion 
zlotys for the organization of this ceremony securing the money 
for the former servicemen's' lodging and partly for transport. 
A very important and useful thing was the involvement of 
different local milieus. I could see that the former servicemen 
had a completely different approach to it. 
  In their approach you could notice a military approach going 
back to the time of the battle, irrespective of the fact whether 
the resources were sufficient or not. These celebrations were 
simply organized to the best of those people's abilities. And a 
paradoxical final of the meeting was when it started to rain 
heavily -- the Italians say that this is a blessing from heaven 
-- and maybe this rain reconciled all those present there and 
showed that you have to look forward on such occasions and look 
for the things that unite, especially in the face of such 
experiences and circumstances as the battle of Monte Cassino. 
  [Jelenski] Minister Michal Kulesza, the government 
plenipotentiary for administration reform, has resigned, 
accusing your government of halting local self-government 
reforms and aiming at the centralization of power. Does it mean 
that you are, using such an inappropriate word, the first 
brakeman of the Polish Republic? 
  [Pawlak] I value cooperation with Mr. Kulesza very much. I 
think that his different approach to these matters was also 
important at the time when we were seeking the best solutions, 
but I also value the opinion of local self-governments. This 
is, I suppose, where we should start: During the meetings with 
local self- governments you could not find such unequivocal 
opinions as regards the reforms Mr. Kulesza had been putting 
forward. Centralism is not the point here because we are far 
from it, and our suggestions that more prerogatives be 
transferred to provincial governments and give them greater say 
in coordination of regional administration prove that we are 
aiming at the decentralization of decisions, that they be as 
close to the grassroots as possible. But neither do we want to 
transfer responsibility from local self-governments to the 
center, especially in a situation when they have no chance to 
fulfill their tasks. The situation in education can be a 
symbolic example, where, as you know, there was a decision by 
the previous political arrangement whereby the whole of issues 
connected with education be transferred to local self- 
government parishes as of 1 January. We treated this matter 
very democratically, I believe. Well, local self-governments 
were to take resolutions themselves if they wanted or did not 
want to take over schools. It turned out that in such a 
situation the opinion was not at all unanimous, because 
everybody knew the reserves and financial capabilities. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Jelenski] You have been working with Grzegorz Kolodko, 
deputy prime minister and head of the Finance Ministry, for 
almost a month now. How does the cooperation look? Earlier on, 
fears were fairly widespread that you have, putting it mildly, 
fairly divergent views on the creation of the Polish economy. 
  [Pawlak] When I put forward a nomination to the president 
for 
the appointment of Deputy Premier Kolodko, there were even these 
reports about the fact that these contradictions reach back to 
the period of the creation of the coalition, which is not 
altogether true. And I think that a very important matter that 
is worth stressing is the fact that Deputy Premier Kolodko 
[words indistinct] approach to his activities. And I think that 
he has a similar approach. He speaks here of this formula of 
escaping forwards, and so the seeking of solutions through 
looking to the future. And we will surely be striving to 
resolve today's problems quickly -- tomorrow there will be new 
problems, new tasks, new challenges. And this creates 
conditions, both for there to be a good and considerable level 
of activity, and this creates good conditions for many people, 
especially in the economic sphere, that of enterprises, for 
development, for a dynamic look ahead. And I would not hide the 
differences, but would also not treat it as a problem. The 
differences might be a motivating factor, if we are but capable 
of exploiting them so as to find better solutions. 
  [Kassa] Over the last few weeks it has been possible to 
observe that the tensions in relations between the government 
coalition, and the parliamentary coalition, and the president 
have decreased. Do you judge that this gives an opportunity for 
us muddling through up to the presidential elections with such 
an arrangement? 
  [Pawlak] I think that the relationships are multifaceted. It 
all depends on the matters we are dealing with. And, assuredly, 
there will still be various interesting events here in the 
future. But I hope that this approach -- the seeking of 
compromises, the seeking of solutions -- will bear fruit in the 
fact that we will be able to exploit these relationships and 
these often differing views for the seeking of such decisions 
and such activities as, nonetheless, perceive this complicated 
and specific situation in Poland [sentence as heard] And it 
seems to me that in this respect a view of this in such a way as 
to weed out all these decisions and stances that ensue from 
concern for the future is also necessary here, irrespective of 
which side they come from. 
  [Jelenski] The strikes by Solidarity are probably the most 
important component of political and social life in this country 
at the moment. In your opinion, has the government succeeded in 
putting an end to the last wave of strikes? And is an 
understanding with the trade unionists possible? Let us recall 
that a Solidarity demonstration is planned for Warsaw on 27 May, 
and that the union continues to claim that the government does 
not want an accord. 
  [Pawlak] The strikes are an important component, surely, of 
our public and political life, but surely not the only one of 
these important or most important factors. Here, the situations 
are very complicated, and a moment ago you spoke of 
relationships with the president. And within the coalition 
there are, after all, dependent on the matter at hand, various 
approaches at times, various methods and proposals for 
solutions. And if this was solely a matter of strikes and 
solely a matter of negotiations with Solidarity, then perhaps it 
would be easier to find solutions here that could satisfy 
everyone. But this situation is far more complicated. And I 
think that the strikes at the moment... [pauses] A tendency 
towards a certain calming of the situation is seen at the 
moment, as regards the strike situation. I am aware of the fact 
that in many concrete situations there are reasons and that 
there are causes that give conviction to many people that it is 
necessary to reach for very radical methods of protest. But 
also, many people have convinced themselves that a method for a 
solution of these difficulties is not so much protest as 
well-organized work, and the seeking of effective solutions, 
both for internal use and for expansion and activity outside. 
And as to the main problem, then I think that this main problem 
is the approach to the termination of the strikes. For, after 
all, as regards the postulates, and these detailed branch 
postulates, they have been signed in accords with both the brown 
coal sector and the hard coal sector. General postulates have 
become the subject of the decisions of the trilateral 
commission. A timetable for their implementation has been 
adopted, these main ones regarding the taxation of incomes are 
already being implemented. The matter of the control of 
remuneration -- here there is a clear divergence as to the time 
and rate of departure from these administrative methods, but as 
to the aim there is full agreement. And the government has also 
made a clear declaration in this respect. The point is just 
that, in departing from one set of solutions we should not bring 
about economic destabilization. 
  So, if we look at problems instead of postures a good 
perspective may be seen. 
  There is a problem getting out of the protest calmly, 
without 
losing face. I think Solidarity had a few good opportunities to 
end the whole strike action at this stage with some success. 
Now the situation is becoming a little blocked, because there 
is too much concentration on positions, so to speak, and too 
little regard for the problems; but I hope we are able to 
resolve the matter calmly. All that is needed here is an 
accommodating approach by both sides. It is difficult for us to 
accept the formula, that we enter into negotiations with 
Solidarity only, and leave aside the other trade unions, which 
have after all been taking part in these negotiations, in 
agreements -- for in a moment we will have similar demands from 
the other trade union organizations. I think it is also a 
matter here of mutual respect in the trade union milieu. We 
must recognize the fact that there are several important trade 
union organizations, respect their position, their views in 
specific situations, and with this kind of approach there will 
be no problem with finding solutions. 
  I stress once again that to end the whole process 
positively, 
we need good will on both sides, and sometimes it is hard to 
find a good solution which would fully satisfy everybody, but I 
hope we will bring it about. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] At a news conference, Prime Minister 
Pawlak pointed out the following problems: 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] We had the opportunity to brief 
President Delors on Poland's political and economic situation. 
We told him Poland puts the goal of integration with the EU 
first, but is not neglecting other actions streamlining 
cooperation, particularly regional cooperation, chiefly with the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and the CEFTA [Central 
European Free Trade Agreement]. We have intensified our work in 
this sphere. A very important part of the talks concerned the 
infrastructure in the broad sense, including communications, but 
also concerning the information infrastructure. These are the 
areas that will decide the future, on the conditions for the 
economy and our society's development. This enables us to look 
with greater faith at Europe's future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Krzysztof Gacek: "A Return of PRL?; Pawlak's </F>
Government Proposes Centralism"] 
  [Text]The slowing down of the work on administrative 
reforms and the government's centralist tendencies are the 
reasons behind the resignation of Minister Michal Kulesza. 
According to the opposition, the government not only has no 
ideas for changes, but it outright reaffirms the ways of the old 
Polish People's Republic [PRL]. A majority of the parties is 
against abandoning the reforms. 
  On Friday [20 May], Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak accepted 
the resignation of Minister Michal Kulesza from the post of the 
government's plenipotentiary for reforms of public 
administration. Kulesza announced his resignation from the post 
a week earlier in Poznan, during a Second All-Poland Conference 
of Territorial Self- Governments. 
  "The reason for my resignation is the current government's 
decision to slow down the work on reforming the country's 
administration" -- Kulesza said this past Saturday. "The 
governing coalition has no plans for any kind of system-wide 
transformations of the state, it ignores self-governments, it is 
against powiats [small administrative units], and it strives to 
achieve centralized management." 
  According to the former minister, the government not only 
has 
no vision or plans for changes, but it outright proposes a 
return to solutions deriving from the PRL period. This is 
demonstrated by draft laws being prepared by Michal Strak, chief 
of the Council of Ministers' Office [URM], on URM, on 
governmental and territorial administration, on employees of 
state offices (an amendment to the 1982 law), and a superficial 
law on state civil service. 
  "I cannot reconcile a loyalty towards the government with a 
faithfulness toward a program of decentralization and reforms of 
public administration" -- Kulesza says. "I do not want to be 
responsible for disassembling the program of reforms." 
  In a statement issued to journalists, the former minister 
said that decentralization is required in Poland because an 
overly centralized state is managed inefficiently, with taxpayer 
money being spent irrationally, and at times it is even outright 
wasted. 
  The current governing team is returning not just to the old 
personnel, but also to the old way of thinking, as exemplified 
by the practice of "booty sharing" which was introduced in the 
clerical sector of the territorial administration. 
  "There are many marvelous mayors and chief officers of 
groups 
of villages [wojtowie] in the Polish Peasant Party, whose 
managerial skills are as good as those of wojtowie coming form 
other parties" -- Kulesza told journalists. "The misfortune is 
about the fact that is not they that are the intellectual basis 
for the party's leadership, and that it is an apparatus which 
strives only at strengthening its own position that has the 
upper hand in the party." 
  In Kulesza's view, the other participant in the coalition -- 
the Democratic Left Alliance -- does not transform its 
reform-oriented program into specific measures. 
  The former plenipotentiary expressed his concern over the 
subsequent fate of some draft laws which were prepared by his 
office -- these concern public orders [zamowienia publiczne], 
economic activities by gminas [small administrative units], and 
self-governmental appeal collegia.

<F P=106> [Report by Ryszard Choroszy: "The First Session of the </F>
Defense Affairs Committee of the Council of Ministers; A Defense 
Document Is Being Prepared"] 
  [Text] At the first session of the Defense Affairs 
Committee of the Council of Ministers, chaired by Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, problems related to the country's defense 
system were discussed. A pertinent document was presented by 
National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. After it is 
supplemented with recommendations and conclusions, it will be 
discussed at the next government session on Tuesday [24 May]. 
  The committee was set up by a 12 April government 
resolution. 
The government issued a positive opinion on the bill submitted 
by the chairman of the Council of Ministers concerning the 
establishment of a Standing Inter-Ministerial Team of the 
Committee for Defense Affairs of the Council of Ministers for 
Countering Threats and Other Crises. Its chairman will be the 
minister of internal affairs and his deputy -- the minister of 
national defense. 
  It is worth recalling that in early May the Council of 
Ministers, at a secret session with the participation of 
President Lech Walesa, dealt with the document called "Problems 
of the Country's Defense System and Military Aspects of the 
Security Policy of the Polish Republic." As National Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said, at that time certain 
controversial problems were supposed to be resolved by the 
Defense Affairs Committee of the Council of Ministers before the 
document was submitted to the Sejm. 
  At the Thursday session the minister of national defense 
submitted the basic problems that needed to be resolved -- those 
related to the country's defense system, such as problems linked 
to the division of powers between the Ministry of National 
Defense [MON] and the head of the General Staff of the Polish 
Army. The committee supported a variant which does not require 
any changes in the Small Constitution. 
  The submitted document concerning Poland's defense policy 
consists of three parts. The first one includes the legal 
foundations of the functioning of the Armed Forces, such as the 
amendment of the existing law or the preparation of a new law on 
the general duty of defending the Polish Republic, the bill on 
martial law and a state of emergency, on military discipline, on 
responsibility for material damages (now in force is the decree 
of 1955), and on the billeting of the Armed Forces; the document 
is now being reviewed by the individual ministries. 
  The solutions proposed in the bill will not only make it 
possible to resolve the most urgent problems of the cadres 
related to housing; they will also help the Army to manage more 
rationally the property that it owns. 
  Organizational changes in the Army would lie in the 
establishment of three types of forces: Land forces, naval 
forces, and air forces. They would be subordinated to the chief 
commander, who is now the head of the General Staff of the 
Polish Army, but in the future it will be the Chief Inspector of 
the Armed Forces. He is supposed to be responsible for the 
training and mobilization of the Army. 
  Another section of the document deals with concepts of the 
division of power between the minister of national defense and 
the head of the General Staff of the Polish Army. There are two 
options for resolving this issue. In the first option, the new 
office of the chief commander of the Armed Forces would be under 
the president, and the MON head would then fulfill controlling 
functions. 
  In the second option, the president would exercise 
supervision over the Army; he would not, however, interfere with 
the civilian section. Also, the National Defense Committee 
should be replaced by the National Security Office in such a way 
as not to make it necessary to change the binding Basic Law. 
  The document also includes a report on the technical 
condition of the Army. The MON leadership estimates that this 
condition is dangerous. As a consequence of the continuation of 
the present financial policy concerning the Army, our country 
may entirely lose its defense credibility. Already today the 
parameters of our equipment are worse than the parameters of the 
equipment of the Western Armies. This may also lead to the 
lowering of the Army's morale. 
  The authors of the document believe that it is necessary to 
adopt the principle that the condition for rational planning of 
expenditures of the defense system is prior knowledge about how 
much money needs to be spent on the Army. NATO states plan 
their expenses for three periods: for 10-15 years, for three to 
five years, and for one year. 
  In a situation when work is under way on the main points of 
the socio-economic policy until the end of 1997, and on the 
predicted expenditure in the budget sphere, including national 
defense, the decisions that are made in this period may greatly 
influence the financial condition of the Army, the level of 
armament, and the security of the state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuri Matochkin, head of the administration </F>
of Kaliningrad Oblast, by Wieslaw S. Debski; place and date not 
given: "Kaliningrad--A Special Town"] 
  [Text] [Debski] Cooperation between Kaliningrad Oblast 
and Polish voivodships located near the border is most commonly 
associated with two "roundtables" and several seminars 
concerning this topic. However, are there any concrete results 
of those discussions? 
  [Matochkin] We believe that "roundtables" are a good 
organizational form of keeping up cooperation in our region. 
They were necessary at the beginning of our cooperation--they 
created conditions for its foundation. The most important 
matter is the fact that both entrepreneurs and politicians have 
already been participating in talks at those tables; they have 
shared the necessary information with each other. 
  [Debski] More specifically, could you tell us how many joint 
Polish-Russian companies there are in the oblast and what the 
size of Polish investment there is? 
  [Matochkin] Twenty-eight percent of the trade is with 
Poland. We have 742 joint-venture companies; the largest portion 
of them, 275, are joint-venture firms with Polish companies. 
  You are also in a good position as far as investment is 
concerned; you occupy the second position, close behind the 
Germans, whose financial possibilities are certainly much 
greater, and we understand this. For us, Poland is attractive 
not so much for the size of its investment but because it has 
people who are energetic and entrepreneurial. It is they who 
are establishing companies in the oblast and conducting trade. 
  [Debski] Kaliningrad Oblast has been announced as a special 
economic zone. What does this mean to foreign businessmen? 
  [Matochkin] By virtue of the decision by the president and 
the government, the oblast has obtained a number of allowances: 
  --Tariff concessions--all merchandise coming to us is exempt 
from the import customs duty, and merchandise manufactured in 
the oblast is exempt from the export customs duty. 
  --Tax allowances--foreign companies or companies with mixed 
capital are exempt from taxes entirely or partially, for a 
specified period. The size of the allowances and the time of 
their being in force is found on a special scale that depends on 
the type of production. 
  [Debski] According to businessmen, however, not all of these 
allowances can be found in practice. 
  [Matochkin] I can say that tariff concessions are, in fact, 
already in force. Indeed, the tax system is not functioning as 
it should yet, also because there are still only a few companies 
that meet all of the conditions. For example, if a company 
wants to get a 50-percent reduction of its income tax, it must 
export 50 percent of its products. 
  We are now dealing with this problem--we are analyzing what 
results the allowances and reductions do or do not yield. 
  We are also analyzing the functioning of tariff concessions 
and their influence on the level of our prices. It turns out 
that the tariff concession for food, where the tariff to be paid 
is approximately 30 percent, decreases the price of food 
commodities by 10-15 percent. Thus, reductions are more 
beneficial to businessmen than to the inhabitants of the oblast. 
We understand, of course, that the profit rate must be higher 
here than in other regions of the Russian Federation; however, I 
do not think the proportions between the profit and the 
reduction of prices are correct. 
  All things considered, I can say that the special zone is 
functioning and yielding results, even though they are still not 
the results we would like to see. This is understandable. We 
have not been working in this system long. The most recent 
allowances and reductions came into effect in February 1994 and 
the first ones in late 1992. What is needed, then, is patience, 
all the more so because we want to further develop the concept 
of this zone. 
  [Debski] People in Poland are deeply concerned about the 
accumulation of troops in the oblast. Some say that there are 
as many as 200,000 of them. Why so many? 
  [Matochkin] I could ask those who say such things to prove 
that there are really 200,000. 
  [Debski] How many soldiers are there really, then? 
  [Matochkin] If we were to count the soldiers and the 
officers along with their families, then, if we assumed that 
each of the families consisted of three persons, we would 
estimate the figure at 200,000. 
  [Debski] Along with the families? 
  [Matochkin] Yes. Along with the families. 
  [Debski] However, you yourself said once that the military 
people constitute 10 percent of the oblast's population, which 
is 920,000 people. 
  [Matochkin] That was the case when I said this, a year and 
a half or two years ago. Since that time, we have been 
witnessing the process of limiting the armed forces. Standing 
units are being liquidated, such as the 24th Brigade of Rocket 
Cutters that has arrived here from Poland. Other units are 
being reduced in size--for example, divisions are being 
transformed into brigades. Moreover, each of the type of troops, 
apart from the border-protecting units, has too few soldiers. 
Simply, there are not enough draftees. 
  Russian Defense Minister Pawel Gratchev has announced that 
we 
are planning, or, more specifically, that we are discussing, the 
idea of establishing the so-called Kaliningrad defense region. 
It is supposed to save money through the liquidation of 
parallel services. Today both the Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army 
have their own units of material supply, for instance, even 
though it would be cheaper if they were joint. This will lead 
to a further reduction in the number of troops. 
  [Debski] Is there a program for these reductions? 
  [Matochkin] Yes, there is. 
  [Debski] For how long is it scheduled? 
  [Matochkin] Until the year 2000 for the time being. The 
fact that your authorities keep repeating the figure 200,000 
only proves how poorly your intelligence services are working. 
After all, it is not all that difficult to count soldiers. 
  The Russian Federation does not have the possibilities to 
develop its armed forces; it has no money for that. It can only 
maintain them on a level that is necessary for our defense. 
  I believe that the issue of the size of our armed forces is 
a 
political card that is being played on purpose. There have been 
proposals recently, such as the one by Algirdas Brazauskas that 
a demilitarized zone be set up here. But why? What are the 
arguments for this? Does the oblast threaten anybody? 
  [Debski] Apparently such are the feelings... 
  [Matochkin] If so, there must be further logic. If we 
demilitarize the oblast, will Lithuania and Poland be 
demilitarized as well? Otherwise, we will feel threatened. 
  [Debski] This is a fundamental problem in our relations as 
the Polish president sees it. Now, what problems can you see? 
  [Matochkin] There are no serious problems. We should try to 
cooperate more effectively, more openly; this cooperation should 
be more advantageous to both sides. I consider our relations to 
be normal. Cooperation with our Polish partners is very good. 
  There is only one matter we want to complain about. We have 
started building the Kaliningrad-Elblag highway, which, 
incidentally, was a Polish initiative. We will complete our 
portion this year; we will reach the border. And what next? 
When will the Poles complete the rest? 
  [Debski] So the issue of the Vistula Lagoon navigation is 
not a problem for you? 
  [Matochkin] It certainly is. But, all right, let us discuss 
problems if you want to. I believe that controversial issues 
should be resolved, such as the issue of the Vistula Lagoon or 
the highway. Who most wants to see the issue of the Visula 
Lagoon navigation resolved? You do. And who wants to see the 
construction of the highway completed? We do. Let us, then, 
help each other on both issues. Otherwise, it looks like we are 
relenting on the issue of the Vistula Lagoon, but you are not 
budging on the issue of the highway. 
  We can see three controversial issues: 
  a) The Kaliningrad-Elblag highway: What is needed is a clear 
answer to whether the Poles want to build it. If you have no 
money for it, we will look for some together. For example, we 
can visit the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
together and try to get the money there. 
  b) The Goldap-Gusiew border-crossing site: I want to know 
what our side will get out of it and what you will get. Poles 
know that this border crossing will increase traffic near the 
border. We want it to be the second variant of the road to 
Grodno--not through Lithuania. 
  c) The Vistula Lagoon: Right now, the situation at the 
lagoon 
is satisfactory as far as we are concerned. I understand, of 
course, that Poles have a differing opinion. 
  What we should do, then, is sit down and discuss all of 
these 
problems at the same time. In one issue we will make a 
concession, in another you will. On all of these issues, the 
time for discussions has ended: Specific problems must be 
resolved now. 
  Postscript: When we were saying goodbye to each other, Yuri 
Matochkin said: If President Lech Walesa does not believe the 
figures we submit, he might come and visit us. I am inviting 
him. We will show him all of the places, all of the units he 
wants to see. He may see for himself that 200,000 soldiers are 
not there.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ondrej Dostal: "`Pro-Government' Versus </F>
`Opposition' Parties: 35.8 Percent to 25.1 Percent"] 
  [Text] Yesterday we published the results of a 
representative survey of public opinion that was conducted by 
Slovak Radio's Methodological Research Department at the 
beginning of May. It transpires that, at the time of the 
survey, only three political entities -- the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], the Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL], and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] -- managed to 
cross on their own the threshold of 5 percent of votes needed to 
enter the parliament. However, apart from them, there exist 
another nine political entities that are preferred by more than 
2 percent of voters (after subtracting those who do not want to 
go to the polls or who did not give a reply). From the total 
number of respondents, 50 percent supported one of the 
parliamentary parties and 16.8 percent one of the 
extraparliamentary parties. Parliamentary parties supporting 
the government gained 26.2 percent, opposition parliamentary 
parties 23.8 percent, extraparliamentary parties cooperating 
with the government parties 9.6 percent, and extraparliamentary 
parties cooperating with the opposition parties 1.3 percent. 
Hence, the overall ratio of preferences of "pro-government" 
versus "opposition" parties is 35.8 percent to 25.1 percent. 
  If the election results coincided with the results of the 
survey and if no pre-election coalitions were formed, the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic would be composed as 
follows: HZDS -- 84 deputies; SDL -- 35 deputies; KDH -- 31 
deputies. If we took into consideration also the actually 
functioning Hungarian parliamentary coalition, the HZDS would 
have 72 deputies, SDL 30 deputies, KDH 27 deputies, and the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH]- Coexistence 
coalition 21 deputies. 
  The electoral preferences of coalitions made up of entities 
with a similar orientation were also ascertained during the 
survey. The following composition of the parliament would arise 
from replies to this question: Coalition of nationally oriented 
parties (HZDS, Slovak National Party, Christian Social Union) -- 
54 deputies; coalition of left-wing and social democratic 
parties (SDL, Social Democratic Party in Slovakia, Green Party 
in Slovakia, Farmers Movement) -- 41 deputies; coalition of 
right-wing and liberal parties (KDH, Democratic Party, National 
Democratic Party-New Alternative, Democratic Union, Party of 
Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen) -- 35 deputies; and coalition of 
Hungarian parties (Coexistence, MKDH, Hungarian Civic Party) -- 
20 deputies.

<F P=106> [Report by Judit Brogyanyi: "Is Coexistence at a </F>
Crossroads?"] 
  [Text] The results of the first round of elections in 
Hungary had a great impact on the politics of Hungarians in 
Slovakia. The coalition talks on joint participation with the 
Coexistence at the autumn elections which was initiated by the 
Hungarian Civic Party and the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement [MKDM] still have not brought any results. In fact, 
the reluctant Coexistence has even postponed the signing of the 
expired agreement on a two-party coalition with the Christians 
which was first made two years ago. 
  The concern of the electors is shown by the facts that the 
local organizations of the three political parties have made 
agreements of their own will, and an action to collect 
signatures is in progress which was started with the signatures 
of renowned personalities of the nearly 600,000-strong Hungarian 
community to win the support of people who are in favor of the 
coalition. The Coexistence's latest statement that called for 
making a union rather than a coalition appears to have ignored 
the obvious intentions of the citizens. According to the MKDM, 
this statement proclaims generalities, it lacks concept, and 
there is not even time to detail the ideas and to draw them up 
precisely, and it rejected the idea. 
  The seriousness of the situation is shown by the fact that 
the chief editor of UJ SZO, the only Hungarian weekly newspaper 
in Slovakia, one that strives for balance between the parties 
and carefully maintains its independence, wrote a rather open 
analysis headed "Crossroads," turning to the Coexistence and 
especially its chairman, because -- as Jozsef Szilvassy writes 
-- "the conductor's baton is still in Miklos Duray's hands." 
Acknowledging Duray's truly unique merits in the actions 
against the previous regime, he points out that "the politician 
who had a keen perception and made excellent analyses even at 
the beginning of the 1990's," and who quickly realized Meciar's 
serious mistakes, perhaps came under the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum's [MDF] influence too much and committed himself as a 
staunch adherent of the Hungarian government party -- "it can be 
assumed for what kind of ideological, current political, and 
financial reasons." According to UJ SZO, Duray did not learn 
from the MDF's politics fraught with mistakes; in fact, "due to 
his bias and his nostalgia for the false ideas of the last 
century, he did not even manage to dispel the suspicion among 
the small group of well-intentioned Slovak intellectuals that 
territorial autonomy is not the only one of his final goals." 
  According to UJ SZO's chief editor, in politics, the merit 
of 
yesterday does not excuse the mistakes of today. Therefore, the 
Coexistence, whose politics disappointed many people, should re- 
examine its past actions and especially its links with Hungary 
because we would all suffer the consequences if the "political 
movement that has a significant basis remained within the 
constraints it had created." 
  The Coexistence's union plan is presumably guided by the 
thought that the new political unit would integrate all four 
Hungarian parties in Slovakia and, within the union, it would 
vindicate the political leadership to itself, the experts 
believe. The reluctant party leadership is visibly worried 
that, recognizing the requirements of political realism and the 
consequences of the Hungarian Socialist Party's victory in 
Hungary, the Hungarians who make up 11 percent of the population 
would be happy to support Weiss's left-wing party that also has 
Hungarian deputies, or the sober Hungarian civic liberals who 
learned from the mistakes of the former government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by Karol Wolf; </F>
place and date not given: "Patient Politician Michal Kovac"] 
  [Excerpts] [Wolf] Prior to becoming president, you held 
the post of the chairman of the last Federal Assembly and you 
took part in practically all important talks between the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Civic 
Democratic Party as an HZDS representative. Which of the Czech 
politicians with whom you worked do you remember most fondly? 
And with which one would you not want to work again? 
  [Kovac] I will avoid the second part of the question but I 
must say that there are many Czech politicians whom I respected 
and still do today. They are particularly the ones who, in 
addition to professional qualities, had the ability of human 
rapport with the political partner, even an adversary, and could 
offer trust for trust and sincerity for sincerity. I must say 
that I knew many of the present Czech politicians personally at 
the time of normalization. They are Messrs Kocarnik, Dyba, 
Strasky, but also Mr. Klaus. These human contacts certainly 
helped us at the time when understanding and patience were 
needed. [passage omitted] 
  [Wolf] You have certainly spent a substantial part of your 
political career in the HZDS and in cooperation with the former 
Slovak Prime Minister Meciar. When did you two first meet and 
how do you remember it? 
  [Kovac] We first met in the first Slovak post-November 
Government, which I joined a little earlier. We were all 
waiting for an interior minister, and Mr. Meciar was appointed 
to the post. I liked him as interior minister, and my then 
colleagues felt the same way. Apparently, he made a good 
impression also on the Public Against Violence Movement 
coordination center, for they nominated him for the prime 
ministerial post after the first free elections in 1990. When 
Vladimir Meciar became prime minister, I admired his work 
enthusiasm and his ability to grasp the essence of an issue. I 
remember that he led the government session at a tremendous 
speed, and not all of us could keep up with him. Nevertheless, 
his negative features had also already been demonstrated at that 
time. He acted unfairly, for instance, more than once towards 
First Deputy Prime Minister Carnogursky, and later, when he 
learned that some colleagues like another deputy prime minister, 
Kucerak, demonstrated their independence, he was quick-tempered 
and often arrogant in his reaction. I often had the feeling 
that Mr. Meciar is lacking more tolerance. At the time, 
however, it was easily explained by the tremendous stress and 
the large quantity of work that overwhelmed us all. It was a 
tremendous feeling of responsibility, and I did not perceive the 
negative features of Mr. Meciar -- and they were not just the 
ones I listed, others appeared later -- as something that could 
be potentially dangerous. 
  [Wolf] Have you also met with Vladimir Meciar privately? 
  [Kovac] I do not know him well as a person. There were not 
enough opportunities for friendly meetings and discussions. 
After all, these posts mean that one constantly thinks only 
about the work, and does not have the time to get to know even 
the fellow workers with whom he is in daily contact. 
Nonetheless, I remember that I made several attempts at a 
friendly relationship, because I believe that even for a cabinet 
team it is good to know one another. I learned, however, that 
Mr. Meciar feels differently. He avoided sitting down over a 
glass of beer or wine and discussing something that could not be 
directly linked to politics. He never accepted an offer, for 
instance, to spend a holiday with families of his colleagues. 
He was probably happiest with his family, and did not like 
company. I respected this. With other fellow cabinet members, 
however, I enjoyed closer contacts that carried over in our 
families, and have in most instances survived until now. 
  [Wolf] Just before Meciar's cabinet was recalled, Slovak 
Parliament Deputy Chairman Cernak said that people in Slovakia 
are scared to use the telephone and speak aloud in enclosed 
rooms. Were you scared, too? 
  [Kovac] Several deputies and members of the former cabinet 
shared with me their suspicions of being watched and of having 
their telephones bugged. Although I could not verify it, I 
considered it unnatural that constitutional officials should 
fear wiretapping. Later I learned that it was possible even in 
my case, but I did not follow through to find out who, 
wherefrom, and what. To answer your question, however, no, I 
was not scared. 
  [Wolf] Can you imagine the duo Meciar-prime minister and 
Kovac-president to work again in Slovakia? 
  [Kovac] Theoretically, everything is possible. As far as I 
know, however, it is unimaginable according to Mr. Meciar. He, 
himself, declared several times that if he accepted the 
commission to form the new government from my hands, he would 
immediately ask for my resignation. There have even been 
reports that a referendum should decide on my post. I am ready 
to accept the decision of my fellow citizens but insist that 
these rules must also be respected by others. So, I could 
imagine even such a situation as to which you referred but I 
have a feeling that Mr. Meciar cannot imagine it.

<F P=106> [Antonia Vymazalova report: "Execution of Posts Under </F>
Control"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava -- Yesterday's 11th meeting of the 
government was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac 
because Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is paying a state visit to 
France. [passage omitted] The government approved a National 
Council of the Slovak Republic bill on the issue of state bonds. 
Its passage will make it possible to gain on the capital market 
the necessary financial resources to cover the state budget 
deficit on the Slovak Republic's state closing account for last 
year. The state bonds should be issued by the Ministry of 
Finance in a total amount of 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. 
Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that, in view of the low 
level of liquidity of Slovak commercial banks, the bonds would 
not be issued all at once. A wide range of entities, from 
individuals to bank consortiums, will have access to them. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Ministry of Finance submitted to the government meeting 
a 
report on the use of budget resources in the second half of 1992 
and in 1993. According to the report, individual government 
departments last year drew Sk248 million and in 1993 Sk543 
million without justification. The ministries, particularly the 
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, 
and the Family, used the resources to purchase computers and 
passenger cars without preceding public tender. The relevant 
government members were asked to draw conclusions from the 
results of the inquiry within a month and to report about them 
to the government. 
  Draft amendments to the law on the value-added tax, the law 
on the administration of taxes and fees, and the law on changes 
to the system of territorial financial authorities as amended by 
subsequent regulations were added to the agenda of the 
government meeting. The submitted draft amendment to the law on 
the value-added tax changes the list of goods and services 
subject to the pertinent rate of value-added tax. According to 
Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, under the amendment, the 
taxation of about 10 percent of goods that are currently subject 
to a value-added tax of 6 percent will be raised to 25 percent. 
The higher tax will not apply to any basic, vitally important 
goods. [passage omitted] 
  [Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 May on page 1 carries a 
300-word interview with Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus by Ivan 
Stulajter entitled "Final Talks with IMF on Stand-By Loan Will 
Be Held in a Few Days." In the interview, which was conducted 
the day before the cabinet meeting, Filkus says that the planned 
increase in the number of items that are subject to a 
value-added tax of 25 percent, instead of 6 percent, should 
generate extra budget revenue of "Sk3.5 to Sk4 billion."]

Included in Coupon Privatization"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Slovak arms factories will not be 
included in the second wave of coupon privatization, Ivan 
Kovacik, director of the engineering section at the Slovak 
Ministry of Economy, said. 
  Proposals for the privatization of arms factories are to be 
submitted to the government only by the end of July, whereas the 
list of companies for coupon privatization is to be ready in the 
second half of May, he added. According to Kovacik, the volume 
of weapons production has dropped to one-tenth of the 1989 
level. Arms factories' production worth 2 billion Slovak 
korunas, consisting entirely of spare parts, was exported last 
year. Although more than 20 companies in Slovakia trade in 
weapons, their activity is not being coordinated in any way, he 
noted.

responded on Wednesday [18 May] to the observation made by RUDE 
PRAVO that the tense relations between the president and the 
prime minister are being thrashed out, and that the statement 
"No comment," so popular with both of them, results in even more 
speculation. 
  Klaus was already refusing to comment on the claim that he 
behaves arrogantly towards President Havel on Tuesday [17 May]. 
Targeting Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social Democratic 
Party, who had made this claim, the prime minister said in the 
Czech Radio Radizurnal program, among other things: "Regarding 
famous and world renowned arrogance, he should consider himself 
and let others live their own lives." Zeman said at the Czech 
Social Democratic Party conference on 13 May: "We have a 
certain empathy with the lonely man in Prague Castle, who is now 
and then bombarded with arrogant telephone calls from the Czech 
prime minister." Free Democrats (Civic Movement) Chairman Jiri 
Dienstbier replied to the RUDE PRAVO question concerning 
Friday's conference: "There are political forces here that are 
attempting to keep the president in the Castle as isolated as 
possible."

  [Excerpt] The 45th Sudeten German Congress ends in 
Nuremberg today. At its opening on 21 May German and Austrian 
politicians called on the Czech Republic to enter into a 
dialogue with the Sudeten Germans. Theo Waigel, German finance 
minister and leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, 
welcomed and expressed his support for the progress of the 
Czech Republic toward joining the European Union. However, he 
also said that the Czech Government should officially distance 
itself from the Benes decrees of 1945 [ordering confiscation of 
Sudeten Germans' property] and declare them invalid. 
  As he did in a recent article in the weekly newspaper 
SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock 
again drew an indirect parallel between the postwar expulsion of 
Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia and ethnic cleansing in the 
present Balkan war. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Sudeten German congress culminated in 
Nuremberg today. Our correspondent Jiri Halousek reports from 
there. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] In his speech today Franz Neubauer, chairman 
of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft, rejected Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus's view that Sudeten Germans might be 
individually granted -- in some circumstances -- the right to 
return to their former homeland. Franz Neubauer said this was 
not sufficient as the Sudeten Germans had not been expelled 
individually, but collectively. 
  The congress concluded with a speech by Bavarian Prime 
Minister Edmund Stoiber. He said relations between Germany and 
Bavaria on one side and the Czech Republic on the other had 
developed significantly in the last few years. However, a 
political dialogue of the Czech cabinet and parliament with 
elected officials of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft was 
still missing. Only its introduction would make these relations 
really good. This is why Edmund Stoiber proposed to open such a 
dialogue next year, exactly 50 years from the end of the Second 
World War and the start of the Sudeten Germans' expulsion from 
our country.

  [Excerpts] The 45th Sudeten German Days culminated in 
Nuremberg in Bavaria today. Our correspondent in Germany, Jiri 
Halousek, filed this telephone dispatch. 
  [Begin Halousek recording] [passage omitted] One of the 
first 
speakers to address the main gathering in the Franken Halle at 
the Nueremberg trade fair was Imrich Kruzliak, adviser to the 
Slovak president. Kruzliak conveyed to the Sudeten Germans' 
greetings from Slovakia and said that the Sudeten German issue 
must not be swept under the carpet for political reasons. 
  Afterward, Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
emphasized that Sudeten Germans had to be included, in the 
spirit of friendship, in future German-Czech relations. At the 
same time, he gave them an assurance of support by the 
Bonn-based Federal Government. 
  Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber also voiced 
support for the Sudeten German Landesmannschaft. He recalled 
that this year it was precisely 40 years since Bavaria took over 
the patronage of Sudeten Germans. Edmund Stoiber went on to say 
that in recent years there has been a comprehensive development 
of relations between Bavaria and Germany and the Czech Republic. 
In order to describe them as good, it is apparently still 
necessary that the Czech Government and parliament open a 
political dialogue with the elected representatives of the 
Sudeten German Landesmannschaft. 
  The Bavarian minister-president went on to say that he 
discussed this issue with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in 
August last year. At that time he gained the impression that 
Vaclav Klaus was going to give serious consideration to his 
proposal. That is why he is supposedly waiting for a signal 
from the Czech side. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Jan Ruml by Jiri Stastny; </F>
place and date not given: "The Publication of Files Is a Tool 
for Learning One's Own Past"] 
  [Text] Relations between the police and the 
judiciary, the work of the Office for the Documentation and 
Investigation of the Crimes of the StB [former State Security], 
and making hitherto classified information accessible to the 
public were the main topics of a CESKY DENIK interview with 
Interior Minister Jan Ruml. 
  [Stastny] Mr. Minister, upon her appointment as attorney 
general, Bohumira Kopecna set as her first task improving 
cooperation between the Bureau of Investigation and the State 
Attorney's Office. How does the Interior Ministry intend to deal 
with that problem? 
  [Ruml] Even the police and frequently the courts come into 
conflict with the Bureau of Investigation. I believe the 
tension between these entities, which represent conflicting 
interests, is completely natural. It is important, however, 
that it does not go beyond a certain level of tolerability. 
Last week, a meeting took place on this issue that was attended 
by the minister of justice, the Supreme Court chairman, the 
attorney general, the police director, the director of the 
Bureau of Investigation, and I. We agreed at this meeting that 
the State Attorney's Office would prepare a binding instruction 
for its staff on how it is to deal with problems concerning 
criminal activities, and, at the same time, similar memoranda 
will be prepared for the police and the Bureau of Investigation. 
These bodies are often inundated with work and have the 
tendency to return individual cases for additional investigation 
just to gain time. Frequently, problems are caused by the human 
factor and can be solved by an accommodating approach. 
  It is necessary that the Criminal Code amendment currently 
in 
effect meet expectations and that most of the process of 
obtaining a conviction take place before the courts and not with 
the police or the Bureau of Investigation. 
  [Stastny] Are there similar problems in communications 
between the Police Presidium and lower police units? 
  [Ruml] The problem is much more serious between the police, 
whether enforcing order or investigating crime, and the Bureau 
of Investigation, which often duplicates the work of the police. 
Policemen always see evidence differently from the examiner, 
know more than they can prove, and are assessed on the basis of 
solving cases. That is different from the examiner, who is 
responsible for establishing clear-cut crimes. These interests 
do not always coincide. It often is a matter of the appointment 
of personnel so the people involved get along together. 
  [Stastny] Are you planning to augment the powers of the 
Office for the Documentation and Investigation of the Activities 
of the StB? 
  [Ruml] I do not believe it necessary to augment the powers 
of that office. It would be more expedient to make sure that 
its work is more effective. It has all the powers necessary 
because it can collect documentation as well as investigate, so 
it is also a body active in investigating criminal activities. 
There is nothing to prevent this office from initiating 
criminal proceedings if it obtains the necessary evidence. We 
should focus on the question of whether there are the resources 
within the institution itself. Its powers are sufficient, and 
the 50 employees, I believe, provide it with the conditions 
needed to bring to light many things of the past. 
  [Stastny] How do you feel about the proposed way to publish 
the names of StB collaborators? 
  [Ruml] So far, only the outline of the system has been 
agreed upon. According to this, every citizen has the right to 
know what type of information has been obtained on him. In 
response to a citizen's question, the ministry will either 
report that the specific files do not exist and explain why, or 
the citizen will be given the opportunity to view them, copy 
them, etc. It is a tool for learning about our own past so we 
will not leave blank spots on the map of the past 40 years. It 
should also contribute to a relaxation in society, and every 
citizen should have the right to obtain information on himself. 
  [Stastny] Has the problem of blotting out the names of other 
people referred to in these files been solved? 
  [Ruml] It has not been solved in principle, and no law is in 
the legislative process. Apparently the government will have to 
make a decision on this. Personally, I believe that only the 
names of people who do not belong in the file and appear there 
by some coincidence should be blotted out. If the names of 
agents were blotted out, the law would lose any meaning. Let the 
people know who reported on them! I do not believe that it 
would cause a "witch hunt." We can see from the example of 
Germany that it has more of a purifying effect. 
  [Stastny] How are the police equipment tenders progressing? 
  [Ruml] Some have been closed--the one for jeeps and the one 
for digital fingerprinting systems, for instance. Tenders are 
in progress on a standard police vehicle, an FM radio system, 
and vehicles with speed-gauging equipment for the traffic 
police. The Interior Ministry is inviting its own tenders 
because, so far, there is no law on public orders. We are 
trying for the maximum objectivity and also include on the 
selection commissions experts from other sectors so that not 
even a shadow of suspicion of bribery can fall on the 
commission. This is a very demanding method but the only 
feasible one because the public sphere must be subject to 
control, and open public tender is the best form of control over 
financial spending.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by </F>
correspondent Gyoergyi Orban; place and date not given; Kucan 
speaks in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed Hungarian translation 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Orban] On the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia, war is being waged for the state borders. 
Slovenia would also like a border revision with Croatia. 
[passage omitted] In your view, where will all these border 
battles lead? 
  [Kucan] The war against Bosnia-Herzegovina is being waged 
because of the nationality problems. The striving to resolve 
the nationality issues is justified at all events; but the means 
are not justified. The method that Serb politics have chosen 
for the solution is antidemocratic, and the revanchist voices 
being heard from the direction of Italy luckily reflect only 
certain peoples' stances on the matter of Slovenia's borders. I 
hope that Europe, in the interest of its own future, will make a 
stand for its own position and will defend the principle that 
European borders are inviolable and cannot be altered by force, 
by war. 
  As for the Slovene-Croatian border, on land this is 
definitive; but the marine frontier has not been designated. We 
have now set up a joint commission; I hope that this 
professional committee will recommend to the politicians 
solutions with which the Croatian-Slovenian marine borders can 
also be designated definitively. 
  [Orban] Mr. President, you personally still know a lot of 
leaders from the former Yugoslavia, but also from the new 
successor states. You see events from the inside. What will be 
the outcome of this war? 
  [Kucan] I am mostly acquainted with those leaders who also 
held office in former Yugoslavia. My opinion is that the Balkan 
crisis does not really depend on personalities. It is true that 
in Serbia, for example, most of the threads are held in the hand 
of President Milosevic; but Milosevic is not the intellectual 
author of the concept of greater Serbia. The history of this 
idea goes back to much older times. [passage omitted] Also, 
Milosevic, from Serbia's point of view, is a really successful 
implementer of this concept. As you see, a lot of people support 
this concept, even from the ranks of the opposition. So, not a 
lot depends on personalities. The fate of the war depends on 
whether the opposing sides will accept or not the logical 
European norms that are also included in the Helsinki documents. 
  [Orban] What is your opinion on Central European 
cooperation? 
Do regional relations of this kind have a future? 
  [Kucan] Central Europe is an objective reality, which 
stretches from the Baltics to the Adriatic. I consider this as 
an intellectual position. Let me quote one of your compatriots, 
Gyoergy Konrad [writer], who said that Central Europe 
constituted a world outlook. I agree with him, by all means. 
Central Europe is a spiritual quality, a life situation, a 
stance, a value system. This is where these countries' mission 
lies. They have to bring these values into the common Europe. 
I am convinced that the European ideal can be realized. But, 
if it turns out in the end that an associated or joint Europe is 
not possible after all, Central Europe will gain a new sense and 
meaning. Then we will have to consider the idea of an 
association in an institutional form, from the point of view of 
Central Europe, as against Western and Eastern Europe. 
Naturally, the question of where the borders of Central Europe 
begin is still to be answered.

  [Text] Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the federal 
government, especially for this Radio Prishtina Daily News 
program, assessed the effects of [FRY National Bank governor] 
Avramovic's program so far. He also spoke about further steps 
to be taken in its implementation. Slobodan Nikolic talked to 
Premier Kontic. 
  [Begin recording] [Kontic] I believe we should not be 
satisfied with the results that we have achieved so far. They 
are not definite, they are not final, and they cannot secure the 
achievement of those strategic goals of the economic 
stabilization that we have set ourselves. We are currently at 
the end of one phase -- the reconstruction of the monetary 
system -- and at the beginning of another phase -- the recovery 
of the economy, that is, the increase in production -- and 
parallel to this, certain structural changes. I believe that in 
the coming period it will be extremely important and unavoidable 
to maintain the stability of prices and the exchange rate. 
Moreover, in this context, we have to secure the strengthening 
of [words indistinct] activity. If I were to pinpoint the basic 
problem of the economic policy at the moment, then I would 
define it as revival of production in conditions of price and 
foreign currency stability. 
  [Nikolic] From month to month, the [words indistinct] is 
greater and greater. Can we expect this [word indistinct] in 
the future as well? 
  [Kontic] It is true that in the course of the three or four 
months since the beginning of the implementation of the program, 
the rate of increase in salaries and wages was quite rapid and 
that they have now reached a level that -- in comparison to the 
social product at our disposal -- is quite serious. According 
to [words indistinct] salaries have already reached a level of 
17 to 18 percent in the social product, which is considered to 
be the borderline of salaries in the social product. [sentence 
as heard] Anything that would exceed this level or increase the 
participation of net salaries in the social product would at the 
same time mean upsetting the balance that is really necessary to 
our economic aspirations at the moment. 
  [Nikolic] How do you assess the [words indistinct] incidents 
that have led to a situation that makes it difficult to adopt 
laws, for example, the law on companies, and other legislation? 
  [Kontic] The federal government is conducting an independent 
internal and foreign policy, therefore, it can -- within the 
authority granted it by the Constitution -- adopt, institute, 
and implement all policies that are relevant, but it is quite 
certain that without intense legislative activity by the 
Assembly, it is very difficult to find the appropriate framework 
for the federal government's activity simply because we are 
currently faced with building a new economic and political 
system, and these are coordinates within which we need to 
maneuver, particularly if we keep in mind that the old economic 
system has been transcended, the new one still has not been 
established. This transition of the economy from one state to 
another certainly suffers in a certain sense, because the 
legislative activity of the assembly is not progressing the way 
we expected it to. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 20 May (TANJUG) -- At today's news 
conference for foreign and Yugoslav reporters at the Palace of 
the Federation, Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic 
said that the priorities of Yugoslavia's current foreign policy 
activities are the search for a political solution to the 
Bosnian crisis, the resolution of other aspects of the crisis in 
the region of former Yugoslavia, and the strengthening of trust 
and cooperation with neighboring countries. 
  At the start of the news conference, the Yugoslav foreign 
minister recalled that the government reviewed and adopted three 
reports at its session today -- on the announcement from the 
meeting of the five foreign ministers (United States, Russia, 
Greece, France, and Belgium) devoted to the resolution of the 
Bosnian crisis, on the meeting of the economic group within the 
framework of the international conference on former Yugoslavia, 
and on the recent visit by Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and Vladislav Jovanovic to the 
Republic of South Africa. 
  According to Jovanovic, the Federal Government today 
expressed a positive stance on the announcement of the five 
ministers in Geneva, especially the part renouncing the war 
option. "However, we pointed to the practical shortcomings that 
have faithfully accompanied earlier initiatives of this kind: 
the unequal treatment of all the protagonists in the Yugoslav 
crisis, certain remaining forms of hostility, and the fact that 
the international community should take a more balanced approach 
in the process of establishing full equality and lifting the 
sanctions." 
  The first question to Jovanovic (APA) concerned his recent 
statement about war cries from Austria and Albania. Jovanovic 
replied that it would be best if there were no such cries from 
any country. "Unfortunately, Austria and Albania were involved 
in the process of the disintegration of former Yugoslavia in the 
most flagrant and aggressive way, just as they are now involved 
in exerting pressure on the FRY," he said. Jovanovic added that 
this also refers to their insisting that the sanctions should 
stay and be further tightened and to their "very aggressive 
attitude toward Kosovo and Metohija, Sandzak and Vojvodina." 
  "We would like this hostile attitude to end," the Yugoslav 
foreign minister said. Jovanovic was then asked to present 
Yugoslavia's position on the proposed territorial division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina based on the 49- 51 percent principle. 
  Having recalled the recent meetings with important 
international factors, he replied that everyone was clearly told 
about Yugoslavia's vital interest -- the immediate and permanent 
cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and, as far as the percentage 
is concerned, "it is a matter for the three warring sides to 
agree on." 
  A reporter of the Slovene news agency was almost astonished 
about the greetings which the federal prime minister and the 
foreign minister extended to their Italian colleagues clearly 
alluding to the victory of the Right. Jovanovic first said that 
such greetings from Belgrade are not at all unusual. As for the 
victory of the Right, Jovanovic said, Yugoslavia is not going to 
get involved since this would mean interfering in Italy's 
internal affairs. 
  "We do not have a single serious problem in our relations 
with Italy and we wish to develop cooperation with this country 
and all other countries," Jovanovic said." 
  Commenting on the position adopted by the five foreign 
ministers on the sanctions, voiced at the recent meeting in 
Geneva, Jovanovic stressed that this was the first time that 
Europe, Russia and the United States expressed a joint position 
on the issue. 
  According to him, the fact that the lifting of the sanctions 
is not linked with a final solution to the Bosnian conflict is 
also positive. "That is a certain step forward, but not big 
enough, because it does not lift the sanctions which are a huge 
obstacle to peace in Bosnia," Jovanovic said. 
  A STUDENT correspondent asked Jovanovic: "Up to when will 
the 
Africanization of Yugoslavia continue, considering that the 
nonaligned countries were among the first to stab our country in 
the back, and when will Yugoslavia return to where it belongs -- 
to Europe." 
  "First, speaking about stabbing in the back, the blow did 
not 
come from Africa, but from Europe," Jovanovic said. "Second, 
African nonaligned countries wanted to help Yugoslavia, but the 
former federal government tactically prevented that by turning 
its back on those countries and asking for assistance from the 
European Community." 
  "And third, our activities are not leading to the 
Africanization of the country. We are a European country 
although we are now excluded from Europe," Jovanovic said. 
  The next question referred to "the halt" in relations 
between 
the FRY and Croatia. 
  "The reasons for the halt, if that is true, lie with 
Croatia. 
I would like to remind you that the Deputy Federal Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic visited Zagreb without any preconditions," 
Jovanovic said. "We expected, and continue to expect Croatian 
Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic to come to Belgrade, but he 
has set conditions for his visit. That means that the FRY is 
not slowing down the development of relations with Croatia," the 
Yugoslav foreign minister said. 
  Asked by the Macedonian radio correspondent about relations 
between the FRY and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia], Jovanovic said that "we, on our part, have done 
nothing to make these relations what they are today." 
  "All problems were caused as a result of Macedonia's 
activities. Macedonia opted for secession and got into trouble 
with Greece. It is denying our right to succession by 
advocating secession. This is at terrible loggerheads with 
reality," Jovanovic said. 
  "The moment Macedonia resolves its problem with Greece and 
acknowledges our right to succession and continuity, 
normalization will ensue." 
  Are there any differences in the U.S. and European approach 
to the process of resolving the Yugoslav crisis? 
  "As far as we are concerned, Europe neither has the same 
interests as the United States nor does it view the future 
development of the former Yugoslavia in the same way, because it 
is aware that if the crisis drags on, with all its elements -- 
including the sanctions -- this will also be fatal for Europe. 
The destabilization of the Balkans poses a threat to the whole 
of Europe," Jovanovic said. 
  A German correspondent asked whether the federal foreign 
minister was consulted before the decision was made to withdraw 
certain foreign correspondents' credentials. At the same time 
he expressed his "surprise" that not one German correspondent 
had been put on this list. 
  Jovanovic replied briefly that the decision on the 
withdrawal 
of credentials was under the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Information Ministry. 
  Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic dealt with the 
surprise. "I am pleased that you are surprised that credentials 
were not withdrawn from German correspondents. This strengthens 
my conviction that you too are aware of the objectivity, or the 
lack thereof -- displayed by certain reporters. This does not 
mean that we are pleased with the objectivity of what certain 
reporters are writing. There are limits."

  [Text] Belgrade, May 20 (TANJUG) -- Firms founded with 
foreign capital in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will have 
to adjust by the end of the year their operations to the new law 
on foreign investments which was adopted by the Yugoslav 
parliament on Thursday [20 May]. Full effect of the law is 
expected after the alleviation or lifting of the economic 
sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council on May 
30, 1992. 
  As explained by the federal government, the new law is 
expected to ensure greater legal security for foreign investors, 
grant additional facilities for those who are ready to invest in 
the Yugoslav economy and simplify the investment procedure. The 
law rules that foreigners can found firms in Yugoslavia, invest 
capital in domestic firms, open company branches and buy shares 
and concessions for exploitation of natural resourses. 
  Foreign investors will also be able to import equipment and 
materials for building firms in Yugoslavia tax-free. Foreigners 
are only not allowed to hold more than 49 percent of the shares 
in strategically important branches of industry, such as the 
miltiary industry.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 20 (TANJUG) -- After nearly two years 
of international sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, about one million children in the Yugoslav Republics 
of Serbia and Montenegro live below the subsistence level. 
According to reports of the Yugoslav Commission for Cooperation 
With the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), 
another 200,000 children who have fled from the war-torn former 
Yugoslav republics are on the brink of starvation. 
  "Due to the dramatic fall of the personal and overall social 
standard of living, morbidity and death rates have almost 
quadrupled in only two years", Ljiljana Stojanovic, assistent 
federal health minister told TANJUG. Only 80 percent of the 
children in the F.R.Y. last year received obligatory vaccines. 
According to the Ministry's information, the worsening of the 
conditions in the health system is evident: 1.45 in every one 
hundred hospitalized children died in 1989 and as many as 2.07 
in 1993. 
  The University Children's Clinic, the largest in the F.R.Y., 
gets almost all supplies from the humanitarian aid provided by 
organizations and individuals, the Belgrade daily VECERNJE 
NOVOSTI writes on Friday. 
  "The aid comes neither timely nor in sufficient quantities. 
At the surgery department the number of check-ups and 
operations has been reduced by 92 percent, while the number of 
postoperative infections has increased by 30 percent", director 
of the clinic, Dr Dusan Scepanovic said. At the clinic's 
pediatrics and surgery departments, 141 children died last year, 
which is an increase of as much as [word indistinct] percent to 
the 1991 figure. 
  As in previous years, five percent of the social product is 
being earmarked for the health service. In 1989, it amounted to 
two billion U.S. dollars on the territory of Serbia and 
Montenegro but last year it was merely around 300 million 
dollars.

    [Editorial Report] Ljubljana MLADINA in Slovene in its 17 
May edition on pages 37 and 38 carries a report by Svetlana 
Vasovic, entitled "Perfidious Resourcefulness," about the 
financial machinations that led to the collapse of Dafiment Bank 
and the alleged involvement of the state and the Serbian 
politicians. 
  As Vasovic says, "an affair has broken out in Belgrade these 
days that unveils how Serbia and Montenegro managed to raise 
enormous funds needed for the financing of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia into a truly unusual detail. The 
entire action was based on rapid emergence and an even faster 
collapse of private banks, primarily Jugoskandik of Jezdimir 
Vasiljevic and Dafina Milanovic's Dafiment Bank. In short: 
Naive savers, be it out of need or greed, entrusted several 
thousands (even hundreds of thousands) of German marks to these 
private banks, which either lent their money or invested it in 
such a way that the state got it and then collapsed. The top 
representatives of the Serbian political elite and Milosevic's 
sympathizers received the money, including enormous interests, 
prior to the collapse of these banks." As Vasovic proceeds, 
"the fact that this is a dangerous affair is also seen in that 
as soon as the biweekly DUGA published a confession by the owner 
of collapsed bank Dafina Milanovic and the photocopies of 
receipts that prove the large amounts of money that individual 
Serbian and Montenegrin officials drew from their accounts, the 
Federal Parliament placed the Law on Protection of Privacy on 
its agenda, which would prevent further publication of such 
documents." 
  The correspondent also writes that when the opposition 
weekly 
SRPSKA REC published "the documents that proved that great 
quantities of German marks from the bank were also withdrawn by 
Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic (278,411 Swiss francs), her 
son Marko Milosevic (330,769 German marks), the editor of 
Television POLITIKA Aleksandar Tijanic, and numerous other 
influential potentates, the public prosecutor, just like in the 
old times of socialism, simply banned the issue of the magazine." 
  Going back to the history of the creation of private banks, 
Vasovic writes that the National Bank of Yugoslavia "in 
violation of numerous laws and with the assistance of some state 
inspectors" at the end of 1991 and in the beginning of 1992 
issued licenses for work and the so-called "major authorization" 
to several private banks. At a time of enormous inflation, 
these banks offered higher interest rates than anyone else in 
the West, ranging from 15 to 18 percent per month, Vasovic 
continues, recalling the days when people stood in line for 
hours to deposit their money. "Private banks without any 
appropriate state guarantees naturally worked "successfully" for 
nearly a year and then rapidly folded one after another," she 
says. 
  Her report then analyzes in more detail the collapse of 
Dafiment Bank, whose owner publicly disclosed some of the people 
and the projects that her bank had financed. "In August 1991, 
for example," Vasovic writes, "Dafina Milanovic equipped 500 
Knin special troops led by Captain Dragan [Vasiljkovic]. She 
paid 1.5 million German marks in cash to Brana Crncevic, a 
Serbian ideologist and president of the association of the 
Serbian refugees." "To bribe the Serbian politicians in the 
hope that she would receive concessions for investments in 
important projects," the correspondent continues to write, 
Dafina Milanovic decided on "charitable" acts that were 
"completely at odds with common sense." A comparison between 
"Dafina's sobbing apologies to the public" and "the list of 
illogical investments" of her bank further convinces Vasovic 
that "Milosevic's regime set up Dafina Milanovic to play its 
role." "For the 'Fast Serbian Railroads' project, even though 
she knew 'this could not be lucrative,' she -- allegedly only so 
the railroad workers could 'at least get their salaries' -- gave 
40 million German marks to the Serbian state," Vasovic writes 
"which were in armored cars transferred from her safe to the 
Serbian National Bank safe. She gave 10 million German marks to 
Simpo enterprise (which is one of the most important companies 
that is even today successfully dodging the embargo) that 
vanished into thin air." As it is further stated, "for several 
months, Dafiment Bank, just as it would have been a social 
welfare service and not a private bank, was also paying for 70 
percent of all pensions in Serbia, allegedly out of pure 
compassion of its owner." 
  "Dafiment Bank also directly financed the war in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. The bank gave millions of German marks to 
[President] Radovan Karadzic and [presidency member] Biljana 
Plavsic from the Serbian Republic in Bosnia, and [President] 
Goran Hadzic from Krajina." Vasovic quotes Dafina as saying: "I 
would give them cash. They used to take it away in sacks, 
either Hadzic and Karadzic or Klara Mandic for them." The 
article claims that Arkan's center in Erdut received 3 million 
German marks, while Dafina Milanovic also paid nearly 34 million 
German marks in "special" taxes to the state. "Finally, only 
212 million German marks were left, which were then withdrawn by 
the most prominent Serbian politicians and officials," while, as 
Vasovic writes, "thousands of small account holders remained 
empty handed." 
  The author concludes her article by drawing a comparison 
between the fate of Dafiment Bank and the unexpected success of 
Avramovic's monetary reform, which has prompted numerous people 
to sell their foreign currency for new "convertible" dinars. 
She observes that the praise for Avramovic "uneasily reminds 
one of similar praise for Dafina Milanovic, a failed banker who 
a year ago boasted in front of the very same people with her 
safes, filled for the state budget."

  [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- Serbia's underground 
coal mines will probably have to shut down unless they receive 
bank loans for emergency purchases of raw materials and 
semi-manufactures. In May, eight mines, which ordered and 
received six tonnes of explosives, were notified there would be 
no further deliveries until the mine managements settled 
oustanding debts with the explosives manufacturers, TANJUG 
learns at the Serbian Chamber of Commerce. 
  Most of the mines have had to go back to manual operation 
and 
minimum use of equipment. In order to maintain the output, they 
would have to invest about 135 million dollars in technical 
improvement this and the following year. Negotiations with 
bankers are underway, but it is still uncertain whether they 
will aprove the credits, the Chamber of Commerce says. 
  According to the targeted energy output for 1994, Serbia's 
underground mines are expected to produce 760,000 tonnes of 
coal, and open-pit mines a further 31,6 million tonnes. It is 
highly certain now that this year's coal production will hardly 
reach the expected demand, which is usually at its peak in 
September. Since the Serbian power industry has conducted 
minimal power network overhauls over the past three years, the 
grid will hardly endure an increased load in winter. 
  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) has had to become 
self-reliant 
in power production since the U.N. Security Council imposed 
tough sanctions against it in late May of 1992. The embargo 
also includes a ban on crude oil deliveries.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>
  [Text] Intense diplomatic activity in international 
metropolises, prompted by the crisis in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, do not for the time being offer any [word 
indistinct] solutions, although -- so to speak -- diverse 
activities are being undertaken. In addition to the activity of 
the recently established contact group for Bosnia, comprised of 
high-ranking representatives from the United States, Russia, 
United Nations, and the European Union, attention should be 
given to last week's meeting of diplomatic heads from the United 
States, Russia, Great Britain, and France in Geneva, including a 
three-member delegation of the European Union which included the 
former, current, and future presiding members of this 
association from Belgium, Greece, and Germany. 
  Judging by everything, at this meeting, the Bosnian hot 
potato was again passed into the hands of the Europeans, who, 
after all, lit the fire underneath it, but the Unites States has 
retained the cooking utensils and the spices. Representatives 
of the European Union did not hide their satisfaction with the 
fact that a consensus was reached on the territorial division of 
the former Bosnia- Herzegovina -- 51 percent for the 
Croat-Muslim federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs -- 
with the mighty ally across the ocean. Actually, this 
constitutes a return to its earlier plan. At the meeting of the 
seven ministers in Geneva, the warring sides were called upon to 
begin negotiations on a four month cease-fire within the next 
two weeks. On this occasion, it was established that the 
Bosnian conflict could not be solved militarily, but rather 
through negotiations. The agreement also envisaged the 
maintenance of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union within the 
internationally recognized borders. 
  All of these positions have their flaws, regardless of the 
concepts behind them; they were called into question precisely 
by those who proposed them. Namely, it is known that official 
Washington quickly rushed to placate the powerful Islamic lobby 
by saying that it would not pressure the Muslims, but that it 
would rather attempt to compel them to be more realistic in 
their demands. The Russians, however, were given the far more 
thankless role of convincing the Serbs to accept the plan as a 
whole and all the details. Strange criteria for justice and 
chivalry. In the history of warfare so far, there is no record 
of the defeated side dictating terms to the victor, even going 
so far as to expand territories, which is what is being 
authorized for the Bosnian Muslims who started the brawl in the 
smoke-filled, Balkan tavern. 
  It is certain that the diplomacy of unequal treatment of the 
warring sides is incapable of changing the situation on the 
ground in the direction of peace. It can only worsen it. There 
can be no doubt that such treatment has encouraged the Muslim 
leadership to insist on the war option, because it has perceived 
this as a green light for a new offensive against Serbian 
positions in central Bosnia, Posavina, and Podrinja, which is 
gaining momentum in full view of the UN forces and numerous 
observers. The latest Muslim offensive has made ridiculous the 
international media's lamentations of the allegedly dreadful 
fate of the poorly armed Bosnians which is what Alija's 
mojahedin are also called. The foreign press is proof that the 
arms embargo imposed on all the states in the region of the 
former Yugoslavia by the United Nations back in September of 
1991 does not concern them. [Words indistinct] has recently 
informed its readership about a large shipment of arms for the 
Muslims in Bosnia that was flown into Zagreb Airport by an 
Iranian Jumbo Jet. 
  Aware of the danger of armed conflicts flaring up if the 
Serbian Republic Army is forced to launch a counteroffensive, 
even the most loyal of U.S. allies in Europe are threatening to 
withdraw their blue helmets from the Bosnian vortex, and are 
sincerely -- or so we believe -- striving for a definite, 
peaceful end to the conflicts. [Word indistinct] also suits 
Russia, so that it can devote more attention to potential crisis 
flashpoints in its own country and in the immediate 
neighborhood, in the area of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, 
it is up to the United States to make the next move. Washington 
is expected to finally clearly warn its proteges in Bascarsija 
[part of Sarajevo] that by continuing the war, they cannot get 
more than they have been offered at the negotiating table.

  [Excerpts] Budva, 22 May -- After almost two years everyone 
knows that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia [FRY] are absurd and unjust. However, even if they 
were just, they need to be more flexible, at least enough to 
acknowledge the basic humanitarian needs. Montenegrin Prime 
Minister Milo Djukanovic said this at a news conference today 
with a group of international journalists who have been in 
Budva, Montenegro, for three days. They go to Serbia on 23 May. 
  Djukanovic said that the negative consequences of the 
sanctions on the Montenegrin economy have caused more than $5 
billion in damage, with the greatest repercussions on the 
humanitarian situation because Montenegro is supporting about 
50,000 refugees, 20 percent of whom are Muslim. He said 
Montenegro has been coping with a serious humanitarian crisis 
for months. UN bodies have not yet aproved a single request for 
the import of certain goods which would ease humanitarian and 
other problems. 
  The Montenegrin prime minister was frequently asked about 
the 
effects of the sanctions and how long Montenegro will be able to 
endure them. Djukanovic said that the international blockade 
has been a complete fiasco, but if someone is interested in 
testing our ability to suffer, the nation is resilient and can 
endure the imposed hardships. 
  Illustrating the deadly effects of the sanctions, the 
Montenegrin prime minister said the government had already sold 
several vessels from the republic's relatively opulent fleet. 
However, a number of vessels are in danger because they are 
trapped in foreign ports, and the costs of their anchorage are 
growing alarmingly day by day. [passage omitted] 
  Djukanovic was also asked repeatedly about Montenegro's 
position in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Djukanovic said 
that most citizens of Montenegro would be in favor of a joint 
state with Serbia; others are iin favor of that, but only with 
absolute equality between the federal members. Montenegro will 
not back up on that position by a millimeter, the prime minister 
said. He added that there are secessionist and unitaristic 
political forces in both Montenegro and Serbia. In this context 
he mentioned certain political trends from within the Serbian 
Academy of Science and Arts and certain political views voiced 
at the recent congress of Serbian intellectuals. However, he 
stressed that official policy does not support those views, 
either in Serbia or in Montenegro. 
  Any denial of Montenegro as a separate entity and the denial 
of its equality has a very destructive and destabilizing effect 
on the FRY, Djukanovic warned, and said that the overall 
constitutional commitments do not threaten Montenegro's position 
in any way. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Reports from Prishtina confirm that at about 1100 
today, large Serbian forces blocked all entries and exits to the 
market of the capital of the Republic of Kosova. Thousands of 
people were in the market simply trading, the majority preparing 
for the [Muslim] festival of Bairam. This Serbian police 
operation lasted for more than four hours. It is reported that 
the Albanian traders had more than 500 German marks stolen. In 
addition to this thievery, the Serbian police arrested many 
young Albanians and sent them to the command headquarters of the 
Serbian security bodies in Prishtina.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] 
held a news conference today presided over by Deputy Chairman 
Dr. Fehmi Agani. A report by Skender Durmishi: 
  [Durmishi] Commenting on the possible ways for a solution to 
the Kosova issue, the LDK deputy chairman told the reporters 
that only a solution on the basis of the recognition of the 
right to self-determination of the Albanian people of Kosova in 
a form of political relations and institutional implementation 
can be considered as acceptable solutions. All other forms of 
solution, apparently easier, which are sometimes suggested in 
the framework of Yugoslavia and Serbia, will only create new 
forms for permanent crises and conflicts. 
  LDK Deputy Chairman Fehmi Agani briefed the reporters on the 
importance of the meeting of Presidents Berisha and Rugova, 
which testified to the identity of viewpoints and Albania's full 
support to the solution of the Kosova issue through dialogue and 
in the spirit of the fair demands of the people. Both chairmen 
also encouraged the initiatives and efforts by Albanian 
political parties in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] to achieve a common way of action. 
  Further on, Dr. Fehmi Agani highly appreciated Denmark's 
understanding and readiness to assist in resolving the Kosova 
problem. He greeted the initiative of 11 U.S. congressmen who, 
in a letter sent to President Clinton, asked that the Kosova 
issue be treated in the first summit on problems in former 
Yugoslavia. In the letter, they asked solutions not only 
through eliminating the discrimination and repression made 
evident by all international organizations, but on the basis of 
the right of the Albanian people of Kosova to self-determination. 
  In continuation of his comments on the present Kosovar 
reality, Dr. Fehmi Agani pointed out that despite the Serbian 
power attempts to create a false impression for the domestic and 
international public on the reduction of tension and repression, 
the Serbian repression and violence has continued in Kosova, 
even with increased intensity. 
  Providing data and concrete names, Agani informed reporters 
about numerous cases of raids, mistreatments, pursuits of 
political prisoners, employees of our self-management 
institutions, culture workers, etc. 
  Protesting all these cases, Dr. Fehmi Agani found out that 
through such an increase of repression and despite its verbal 
readiness to resolve the problem of Kosova through an agreement, 
which has been confirmed several times, the Serbian power is 
consciously ruining the preliminary conditions and main premises 
for an eventual dialogue.

  [Text] Skopje, 20 May (TANJUG) -- Macedonian Foreign 
Minister Stevo Crvenkovski returned to Skopje this evening after 
a several-day visit to New York, where he had several meetings 
with Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in the dispute with Greece, and 
with the U.S. President's special envoy, Matthew Nimitz. In a 
statement for the press immediately on arrival at Skopje 
airport, Crvenkovski said that certain progress has been 
achieved in the dispute with Greece. Namely, the talks are 
focused on overall bilateral relations and contacts between the 
two countries are being maintained without Greece's three 
well-known conditions. However, Crvenkovski concluded, it is 
hard to say how things will develop further. He also announced 
that Nimitz will soon be visiting Skopje.

  [Text] Skopje, 21 May (TANJUG) -- The Skopje air base 
Petrovec will soon become a mostly civilian airport. At a 
meeting with the president 20 May, representatives of the 
Macedonian Transport and Defense Ministries agreed that two out 
of three airstrips will be used for civilian purposes -- one for 
passenger and the other for cargo air traffic. After the 
departure of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], the Petrovec air 
base was mostly taken over by the army of the recently formed 
state. This impeded development of civilian air traffic, while 
the military section of the airport was insufficiently 
exploited. Modernization plans have been announced for next 
year, primarily the reconstruction of the runway and signaling 
system.

  [Excerpts] President of the Republic Franjo Tudjman 
unveiled a statue of Don Mihovil Pavlinovic, a leader of the 
Croatian national revival, in Podgora today. President Tudjman 
spoke about the work of Don Mihovil Pavlinovic and the current 
situation in Croatia. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] [passage omitted on details of 
Pavlinovic's life] If it were not for the greatness -- both 
intellectual and political -- of men such as Mihovil Pavlinovic 
we would not have Croatia as it is today. His ideas, similar to 
those of Ante Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual], 
were the foundation for the thoughts of later cultural and 
political players in Croatia, and we have used his ideas today 
as the basis for the movement for the creation of the 
independent and sovereign Croatian state. They have enabled us 
to conduct Croatian state policy, as we have done, on all 
issues, including the Serb problem in Croatia, the general south 
Slav problem, and especially policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
[end recording] [announcer's remarks indistinct] 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] We have proved to the world that 
we 
are in favor of a peaceful solution. The world has seen that 
Croatia is a peace-loving country, but also a resolute country. 
Consequently, if we have to, if our efforts to normalize 
relations by peaceful means and gradually to introduce the 
constitutional and legal system into the occupied territories 
fail, the world will have to understand that Croatia has used up 
all possibilities and that it can no longer support a situation 
in which more than 250,000 Croatian people, refugees live 
outside their homes, even if those homes are destroyed and 
ruined. We will build new ones, we will build everything all 
the way to Vukovar and Baranja [words indistinct] [applause] 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Croats from Australia, Canada, America, and 
Europe are coming back home. The unity and reconciliation of 
all Croats here and in the diaspora have been achieved. Despite 
the war we have managed to conduct a stable economic policy, and 
it is thanks to this that we will manage to introduce our money, 
the Kuna, on Statehood Day. The president said that economic 
experts have recognized our achievements: 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] You have achieved this despite the 
consequences of the war and without a single dollar or mark in 
foreign loans. You have achieved this because you knew what you 
wanted both in the political and economic spheres. Croatia had 
a leadership that knew what it wanted, that led its people, and 
gained the people's trust. [passage indistinct] 
  Let us be worthy of Mihovil Pavlinovic and other great men 
of 
Croatia, and of all Croatian victims who have laid their lives 
on the altar of the homeland. Let us be worthy of everything we 
have achieved in the past four years, worthy of the achievements 
the world has recognized and admires. The world is ready to 
lend assistance to our stable Croatia. As a democratic and 
stable country, we needed allies in the world, but, I assure 
you, the world also needs this stable Croatia as a factor of 
peace and democracy, as one of the important players in the 
creation of the new international order in this part of 
southeastern Europe. 
  Dear brothers and sisters, men and women of Croatia [words 
indistinct] Croatian navy, and the Croatian armed forces. I am 
convinced that the Croatian people will know how to complete 
their historic task, that they will strengthen their sovereignty 
and know how to build the Croatian homeland into a country of 
well-being and progress for all people of Croatia, a homeland 
which Croats in the diaspora, throughout the world, will come 
back to, because today they can be proud of being the sons of 
the Croatian people and of a democratic Croatia. 
  Long live Croatia! [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman unveiled a 
monument to Mihovil Pavlinovic, a 19th-century Croatian 
politician and publicist, in Podgora today. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Speaking about the current 
state 
of Croatian state policy, Franjo Tudjman had the following to 
say about relations with the Serbs: 
  [Tudjman] ``As the head of the Croatian state, and assuming 
full responsibility, I declare here that they cannot count on 
such a policy [not further specified]. Croatia will try to do 
its utmost to integrate the occupied Croatian areas into 
Croatia's constitutional and legal system in a peaceful way on 
the basis of UN Security Council resolutions and the deployment 
of the peace forces. But, if this cannot be implemented within 
the current mandate of the peace forces, Croatia will use all 
means -- to which it is entitled as an internationally 
recognized and sovereign country -- to establish its 
constitutional and legal system on every inch of Croatian soil.'' 
  [Correspondent] Speaking about Croatian state policy on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian president said that its 
continuity resulted in the Washington agreement, the 
implementation of which will contribute to improving Croatia's 
already good status in the world. 
  [Tudjman] ``The Bosniak Muslims have no other way to survive 
in Europe than to rely on and ally themselves with the Croats. 
They have no other way to join democratic Western civilization 
than with the Croats. The Muslim leadership understood this, 
and this has made possible the end to the war and the agreement 
which, as I said, is in our interest, but also in the interests 
of the Muslims. It is therefore in the interest of the Croatian 
people and the Croatian state. This must be clear even to our 
Croat people who, in those terrible events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, first suffered huge losses inflicted by the 
Serb aggressor, and then in the war with the Muslims at the time 
when they were orientated towards the creation of their 
independent Muslim state.'' 
  [Correspondent] President Franjo Tudjman also spoke about 
the attempt to create a parliamentary and government crisis in 
Croatia. He said: 
  [Tudjman] ``Croatia's political pluralism has showed its 
maturity. Croatia will come out of this temporary parliamentary 
crisis stronger. The departure of a few deputies to another 
party will not dent its reputation. On the contrary, this will 
further reinforce democratic Croatia and prove the stability of 
our system, which has enabled us to achieve what we have 
achieved in establishing an independent Croatia and in the 
economy.'' [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Jure Radic: Confirmation of Principles That </F>
Exist in a Multiparty System"] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- The Presidency of the Croatian Democratic 
Community [HDZ] unanimously approved the agreement that was 
signed in the parliament on Wednesday [18 May]. This was stated 
by HDZ Secretary General Jure Radic for Croatian Television's 
Dnevnik [news] program on Thursday night. Dr. Radic appeared as 
a guest on the Dnevnik program shortly after the voting on the 
aforementioned agreement at the session of the HDZ Presidency. 
  "Considering that, according to the HDZ Statute, the 
Presidency makes all important political decisions and is 
accountable for them, it is quite clear that the HDZ accepts the 
agreement signed on Wednesday without any reservations, and that 
it will carry it through," the HDZ secretary general said. 
<H5>  Parliamentary Crisis Avoided </H5>
  Radic said that "a possible parliamentary crisis had been 
avoided in the best way," with the signing of an agreement. He 
stressed that the HDZ had approached the agreement with clear 
stands and the desire to offer to the opposition parties the 
number of leading posts in the assembly to which they are 
entitled to according to the percentage of their deputies in the 
Assembly of the Republic of Croatia. He said that the same 
principle applies to the HDZ, which means that posts of the 
chairmen of both assembly chambers belong to the HDZ. 
  Commenting on the view expressed by Drazen Budisa, leader of 
the Croatian Social Liberal Party, that thanks to the signed 
agreement, the Croatian Assembly will no longer be able to 
function as a mouthpiece [transmisija] of the ruling party and 
the president of the state, Dr. Radic said that the Assembly had 
not been the mouthpiece of anyone in the executive authority nor 
of the president of the state in the past either. He said that 
the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia has the constitutionally 
regulated powers and tasks, and it has been and will be 
functioning in a democratic way as a multiparty assembly. Dr. 
Jure Radic said that the agreement signed on Wednesday is "yet 
another confirmation of the principles that exist in a 
multiparty system founded on the results of the elections." 
<H5>  New Names by the End of the Week </H5>
  In response to a question by the Dnevnik editor concerning 
the election of the future leading people in the assembly, Dr. 
Radic said that the representatives of the parliamentary parties 
have agreed to complete all the necessary consultations in 
connection with that this week, and after that they will inform 
the public on who the new assembly officials will be. 
  Replying at the end of the interview to a question on 
whether 
the assembly, following the signing of this agreement, will 
begin its work and deal with the vital issues for which it has 
the mandate of the Croatian electorate, Dr. Jure Radic said that 
he thought that the public was pleased with the signing of the 
agreement and that the public was in fact one of the reasons as 
to why the agreement was signed. The HDZ secretary general 
repeated that the starting points of the agreement were that the 
election results, which stipulate that the top posts in both 
assembly chambers belong to the HDZ, be taken as the criterion.

<F P=106> [Report by Sonja Modric: "Parliament Is No Longer Mouthpiece </F>
of HDZ and President Tudjman"] 
  [Excerpt] Zagreb -- After yesterday' first round of talks 
between the opposition leaders on the distribution of assembly 
posts that the opposition is entitled to have according to the 
agreement with the ruling party, the Liberals held a news 
conference in the assembly building yesterday. All members of 
the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] tacitly supported in 
front of journalists the view of their president Drazen Budisa 
that all the participants in the negotiations on the 
distribution of power in the assembly and the settlement of the 
parliamentary crisis "had demonstrated a high degree of 
political maturity and responsibility." Budisa expressed the 
hope that the agreement would indeed be respected by all sides. 
He guaranteed on behalf of the opposition that this would be all 
the opposition would do. 
  Budisa declined to reveal the details of the talks on the 
opposition's candidates and the tactics of future moves in the 
assembly. Stressing that he was not authorized to talk about 
that yet, Budisa only conveyed the HSLS' view: Damir Zoric 
should remain the vice chairman of the Chamber of Counties. The 
Liberals are also demanding the post of the deputy chairman in 
the Chamber of Representatives for their candidate Goran Granic, 
who was nominated in a secret ballot. As Budisa said himself, 
he is not a candidate for any of the available posts in the 
assembly as he is involved only in the work in the party. 
  Asked by the NOVI LIST journalist to comment on the view 
held 
by a section of the opposition that the opposition did not 
profit as much as it could have from the agreement, Budisa used 
the allegory: A rope can be stretched to the maximum, but then 
there is a danger of it snapping. It is better to have some 
kind of assembly than not to have one at all. A chaos and the 
collapse of the system do not suit the opposition. Only the 
undemocratic forces could wish a chaotic situation. So, Budusa 
takes the view that the opposition has gotten as much as it 
could, and that the consequences will be significant. The 
situation in the assembly, as he said, has already changed. The 
Croatian Assembly can no longer function as the mouthpiece 
[transmisija] of the ruling party and the president of the 
republic. The rift in the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] 
will continue. 
<H5>  Croatian Democratic Community Has Lost Power </H5>
  The Croatian Democratic Community has lost the power it had 
and one should hope that it will behave accordingly in the 
future. Budisa mentioned the upcoming election of the assembly 
leadership, which will include chairman and deputy chairmen of 
the chambers and the heads of committees and commissions. Since 
the opposition is getting a significant number of places in this 
way, it is clear that its influence will be much greater.

  [Excerpt] The 14th session of the Chamber of Counties is 
expected to resume within an hour. Josip Manolic is expected to 
finally resign at this session. A new speaker and new deputy 
speakers of the chamber will also be elected. This is what the 
Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] deputies have been discussing 
since 1000, that is 1100 [as heard], in state president and 
party chairman Tudjman's residence. 
  Opposition leaders, too, are talking behind closed doors at 
the Croatian Assembly. Both sides are outlining their strategy 
for implementing an interparty agreement. The opposition must 
come up with their candidates for deputy speakers in the Chamber 
of Counties by 1400. As yet, no one is willing to make any 
official statement. This is why we can reveal only an unofficial 
and unconfirmed piece of information: the deputy speaker posts 
in the Chamber of Counties should be allocated to the Croatian 
Liberal Democratic Party and the Croatian Peasants' Party.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador </F>
to the United Nations, by unidentified announcer; place not 
given; from the "Picture vs Picture" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] In your letter to 
the UN Security Council you warn of something that causes fears 
here in Croatia, too -- the freezing of the situation. Judging 
by all appearances, the Serbs from the occupied territories 
accepted the negotiations, but only in order to procrastinate, 
that is, to complete the first phase aimed at separation. This 
in a way threatens to become a Cyprus-style problem. Are you 
afraid of a Cyprus-like situation in Croatia? 
  [Nobilo] I think that such a danger is always there if this 
status quo continues. If it continues throughout this year, 
Croatia should cancel the Zagreb agreement. In other words, the 
Zagreb agreement is valid only if the next step toward economic 
and political issues is made. Failing that, Croatia will have 
to make completely different decisions. I belive that a 
political solution will be reached as a result of the efforts of 
the international community to find a tripartite agreement -- a 
bilateral one now in Bosnia. However, if Knin's position 
becomes tougher, Croatia will have to make completely different 
decisions in completely different circumstances. 
  [Announcer] What deadline would you consider reasonable to 
cancel the Zagreb agreement? 
  [Nobilo] At the moment, I am not advocating that solution. 
All negotiations and the stabilization of the situation follow 
the same dynamics. First, the forces must be separated and 
peace restored. However, I am speaking about a possible final 
scenario. If all serious solutions fail to materialize and if 
there is no implementation in the four months that the 
international community gave itself, and which coincide with the 
UN Protection Force mandate, Croatia should make completely 
different decisions than now. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kragujevac, 22 May -- Borislav Mikelic, prime 
minister of the Republic of Serb Krajina, told Kragujevac Radio 
today that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "has become 
nervous," about the internal problems in his party and that 
"there is nothing else for him to do but to take up the war 
option." 
  Commenting on Tudjman's threat that "he will use all 
available means to reintegrate the rebel Serbs into Croatia," 
Mikelic said that the Republic of Serb Krajina would also use 
all of its available resources to defend all things Serbian and 
which have been Serbian for centuries. Adding that the defense 
of the republic of Serb Krajina "is not what it was when 
Miljevci plateau and Divoselo were attacked," and that Serbs 
would no longer lodge complaints with the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] if Croats attack any of their villages, 
Mikelic said: "Our strength is now tenfold compared to earlier 
years." 
  Dwelling on the statements from Croatia that it would not 
extend UNPROFOR's mandate, Mikelic said the territory in 
question did not belong to Croatia but to the republic of Serb 
Krajina and that the international forces could stay there for 
two years because the Serbs want peace. "Croatia's behavior as a 
whole best illustrates why Serbs cannot and do not want to live 
with the Croats any longer," he said.

Croatian Army's 5th A Brigade marked the forthcoming Statehood 
Day of the Republic of Croatia today. Despite the fact that it 
was formed on 25 October 1992, the 5th Guards' Brigade Hawks has 
an impressive list of military achievements and it is made up of 
experienced soldiers from Slavonia. As General Janko Bobetko 
[chief of the Croatian of General Staff] stressed, this brigade 
earned its historic diploma in Vukovar and all the battlefields 
where Croatia was defended. [passage omitted] [video shows

<F P=106> [Article by Andi Bejtja: "Berisha and Rugova Under the Same </F>
Denominator -- Dialogue With Serbia Unavoidable"] 
  [Text] "...At this moment, it is imperative to establish 
dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade in the presence of a 
third party, to determine measures to normalize life and to 
achieve a political solution to the problem of Kosova." This 
was the essence of the most recent meeting between President 
Berisha and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of 
Kosova. 
  Rugova reaches this verdict three years after the 
proclamation of the republic of Kosova and about two years after 
the start of his political carreer under the title of president 
of a country that no European country recognizes. At every 
meeting with foreign diplomats, he has continually insisted on 
the independence and neutrality of the republic of Kosova and 
the need to place it under a civil protectorate of the United 
Nations, perhaps doing all that is possible to internationalize 
this issue, which in all probability will soon be put forward 
for a settlement. 
  Meanwhile, Berisha, the Albanian nation's other president, 
comes to this point after his harsh statements about NATO forces 
bombing Belgrade and his flexible remarks in this context that 
"Albania is not in favor of changing borders by force, but of 
respect for the rights of Albanians wherever they are." 
  Contradictions are noticeable in these two excursions of the 
two Albanian presidents toward a solution for the question of 
Kosova, which have perhaps resulted from the stagnation of 
European diplomacy over this issue. The entire international 
diplomatic commitment has remained stuck at the limits of the 
autonomy afforded by former Yugoslav President Tito in 1974, 
while Albanian diplomacy has committed itself much further to 
the idea of the republic. It is nevertheless indisputable that 
the two presidents have now reached a common denominator in the 
shape of dialogue with Milosevic. 
  Did Rugova move toward Berisha or did Berisha move toward 
Rugova? 
  It must be said that there has been a basic contradiction 
between the statements of the two Albanian presidents in recent 
years, which, although resolved, cannot fail to leave a scar. 
Berisha has continually declared that he supports Rugova's 
policy, which means he supports the idea of the republic of 
Kosova, at a time when at his meetings with leaders of foreign 
diplomacy he has said that "Albania is not in favor of changing 
borders by force but of respect for the rights of Albanians 
wherever they are," which can imply all sorts of things but not 
an independent and neutral Kosova. 
  This is understandable. Rugova has sat longer in the chair 
given to him by his people than in the seats of European 
diplomacy, whereas Berisha, as the president of a country 
seeking to involve itself in European organizations, has 
necessarily taken up the seat given him by international 
diplomacy. 
  One can therefore firmly say that it was Rugova who moved 
toward Berisha, which means that it was Rugova who could not 
overcome the barriers imposed by those who lead the world and 
decide what will happen to Bosnia. However, can it at the same 
time be Rugova, who mediates in the Albanian-Serbian talks, at a 
time when his theory has been shown to be obsolete and worthless 
in a dialogue with Belgrade, which does not recognize him in the 
capacity of president of Kosova? 
  At a time when no fresh figure who could mediate the 
Albanian-Serbian talks is emerging in Prishtina, it seems that 
in Tirana it is the Albanian Socialists, who long ago came out 
in favor of dialogue with Belgrade, who are attempting to play 
this high-value card. Well-informed sources report that Luan 
Hajdaraga and Bashkim Zeneli, two of the Socialist leaders, held 
a meeting lasting more than two hours in the Yugoslav Embassy in 
Tirana, at which the central topic was precisely the problem of 
Kosova and Rugova's policies. With the help of the 
contradiction between the statements of the two Albanian 
presidents, the Albanian Socialists perhaps wish to acquire a 
proprietary interest in the cause of Kosova in Albania, hoping 
that, if the title-deeds can pass to them, early elections may 
become a reality.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Ivan </F>
Scipiades; place and date not given: "The Hungarian Democratic 
Forum Did Not Fare Badly"] 
  [Text] [Scipiades] How will you hand over the ministry? 
  [Jeszenszky] In harmony with the government decision, we 
have prepared a detailed report on our activity of four years 
and on the current affairs. After the second round of 
elections, when we know the party and officials providing the 
new ministers, we will personally present all the important 
issues, answer every question and, if necessary, make proposals 
regarding the tasks ahead. 
  [Scipiades] Personally, what will you do after the 
elections? 
  [Jeszenszky] I have a rather good place on the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] national list and most probably I will 
make it into Parliament. I think that it is my moral and 
political obligation to continue to deal with Hungarian foreign 
policy and to participate in Hungarian public life as an MDF 
politician. 
  [Scipiades] Do you intend to work in the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the Hungarian Parliament? 
  [Jeszenszky] Yes. I would be a parliamentary deputy first 
of all, and naturally I want to continue my teaching career at 
the university. 
  [Scipiades] In view of the fact that you had the possibility 
of better comparing various foreign countries than your party's 
leaders, in your opinion, what is the reason for your party's 
defeat? 
  [Jeszenszky] It is not yet possible to evaluate the election 
results before the second round. Although I do not think that 
we can count on miracles and a complete turn in the results, the 
fate of the majority of individual deputies has not yet been 
decided. We hoped for a better result in the MDF; I expected a 
few percent more and a more balanced proportion among the 
various parties. I knew that a lot would depend on the mood of 
the last days and even last minutes, and this made the results 
of the first round impossible to forecast. At the same time, as 
a party, the MDF did not fare badly, because it has a firm basis 
and this could show in the second round too. I also believe 
that we can become a well-functioning and professional party in 
the coming period. 
  [Scipiades] Something that the MDF has not been so far. 
  [Jeszenszky] No, because we could not have such experiences 
and we were only a few people. The party's heroic age ended 
with the forming of its government. However, it was difficult 
for the MDF to get used to the role of "government party" and it 
was even more difficult to fulfill the tasks of such a party. 
  [Scipiades] Among the MDF leaders, you must have known best 
the extent to which the left was assisted in its victory in last 
year's Polish elections by the brutal anti-left propaganda 
carried out by the Polish right. The situation is extremely 
similar in Hungary. Have you drawn the attention of the MDF 
leadership to the dangers of such propaganda? 
  [Jeszenszky] I analyzed the Polish elections in detail to 
the MDF national committee, and I drew their attention to the 
lessons. As a party, the MDF understood these lessons. The 
phenomena you have mentioned did not characterize the central or 
local MDF campaign. Perhaps there were elements in the campaign 
that seemed to refute this, but these elements were definitely 
not the results of a strategic decision. 
  [Scipiades] To what lessons did you draw the attention of 
the MDF leaders? 
  [Jeszenszky] I drew their attention to the fact that it is 
not enough to emphasize our achievements, because the former 
Polish Government also achieved rather good results, just like 
the Hungarian Government. Actually, our less-than-expected 
results were not caused by our occasional mistakes; they were 
rather caused by a trend that is characterizing every former 
communist country: the people's exaggerated expectations, their 
lack of readiness to face the burdens, and continued 
expectations of a miracle. Thus, there is a historic trend here 
which seemingly was impossible to confront. Besides, the MDF 
fared better than the leading force of the Polish Government 
coalition in September 1993, and I regard this as a considerable 
achievement, just like the fact that the small parties that 
split from the MDF put up an insignificant presence in the 
elections. Thus, our stable basis of supporters understood the 
Polish lesson. 
  [Scipiades] Certain MDF foreign political experts are trying 
now to drive home the lesson that the Socialists and the 
Liberals will not be able to do different things either 
regarding Hungary's policy toward its neighbors and regarding 
the issue of ethnic Hungarians beyond our borders. 
  [Jeszenszky] I regard the criticism of the Socialists and 
the Liberals as only a campaign trick. In my opinion, in his 
first interview, Imre Szekeres, Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
deputy chairman, formulated their foreign policy program as this 
government did on many occasions in the past four years. Yes, I 
believe that other parties will not be able to represent other 
goals either. If they thoroughly analyze the criticism 
addressed to the MDF, they will find out we have done what could 
be done and what had to be done. If other parties can come to 
an agreement with our neighbors, an agreement that the MDF 
called upon in harmony with the ethnic Hungarians beyond our 
borders in 1989, I will only congratulate them. We are not to 
be blamed for the failure to achieve such an agreement. 
  [Scipiades] Is there anything you would do differently now 
with your present experience? 
  [Jeszenszky] Regarding the main lines and concrete steps, 
there is hardly anything that I would do differently now. 
Although it is possible that it would not have led to any 
results, we should have made more efforts for progress until the 
autumn of 1991, a time when a new age began after the big 
changes of 1989. If, for example, the Balladur plan had emerged 
then, it could have led to some results. Generally, our 
communication with the society was our weak point and, thus, we 
also failed to bring our foreign policy closer to the people. 
  [Scipiades] The interest was there on the part of the 
journalists. 
  [Jeszenszky] Yes. I am not talking about the dailies. 
There are still analytical commentators there, although fewer 
people read these columns. However, there are many more foreign 
policy programs in the foreign television programs, including 
much more analysis. A lot of ministers, politicians, and 
ambassadors are facing very well-trained journalists on CNN!
