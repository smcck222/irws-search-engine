  [Text] During a businessmen's dinner commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry], President 
Rafael Caldera said "for the private sector of the Venezuelan 
economy, a public official who steals money through the 
construction of public works is as reprehensible as a member of 
the private sector who purchases dollars at the Central Bank of 
Venezuela to resell them for an illegal profit, or he is as 
reprehensible as a businessman who raises prices astronomically 
under the pretext of inflation because this will increase social 
groups' exasperation." 
  The president believes it is necessary to understand this 
and 
reach an agreement of solidarity "because when a salesman 
disproportionately increases prices ahead of time, based on a 
report that inflation may affect a specific sector of the 
economy, he is engaging in an act of corruption against which we 
must all fight." Corruption has invaded all sectors of 
Venezuela, and we must struggle against this, not only for its 
effects in the public sector but also for its effects in the 
private sector, he said. 
  During the event, the president said "the country is 
demanding a complete reorganization of public expenses, and this 
entails a long, in-depth, and very serious task that must be 
assigned to experienced people, but they must also have a social 
sensibility and be aware of the country's reality." 
  Caldera said: "It is a fact we are facing very critical 
economic problems, and the Fedecamaras chairman has cited a 
particularly critical issue: A decrease in actual income for 
Venezuelan families. This presents a series of questions, and 
people often wonder about what economic policy my administration 
adopted. I could answer with a quote from Simon Bolivar, the 
liberator: A government's excellence does not reside in its 
theory; instead, it must be adequate for the nature of the 
country in which it is implemented." 
  He said: "We do not believe, nor do we want to believe, in 
the implementation of a dogmatic policy, zero orthodoxy. We are 
prepared to accept all the recommendations, formulas, and 
solutions that are adequate for the current situation, the 
country's nature, and its advisability for the people." 
  The head of state added that we are trying to overcome the 
nearest obstacles, including the terrible fiscal deficit that 
has compelled us to reduce public expenditures and strive to 
overcome, through various formulas in our revenues sector, the 
deficit provoked by a drop in oil revenues. Caldera explained 
the reduction in public expenditures had to be implemented in a 
short time "with a very complex budget in whose preparation we 
do not participate." 
  He mentioned the so-called Sosa Plan, which includes tax 
reforms and "demands a special sacrifice from our fellow 
citizens. We know a tax on bank debits is a transitory burden; 
it is like the taxes that war economies establish in certain 
countries. They are essential for achieving a reasonable 
balance in the area of fiscal expenditures." 
  President Caldera said: We have clearly announced and 
sustained that position, and we said it is part of a commitment 
that involves all Venezuelans: the struggle against inflation, 
the defeat of inflation, or at least its reduction to acceptable 
levels. It is a primary goal and not an aim per se. 
  The president also mentioned the need to increase domestic 
and foreign private investments, and added "we are aware that in 
order to accomplish this, we must try to create the necessary 
conditions to attract these investments to our country." This, 
he added, undoubtedly demands safety, legal as well as genuine. 
We are taking great steps to improve, swiftly but also 
efficiently, the problem of individual and property safety. 
This is an essential objective not only of the central 
government but also of the regional and municipal governments. 
We are also aware that one of the obstacles to investments in 
any country is inadequate safety as provided by the legal system. 
  He said he intends to present an initiative before Congress 
that includes reforms to the Constitution, reforms "such as the 
one that failed last year due to parliamentary details. The 
initiative includes in-depth reforms to the judicial branch that 
will allow corporations to operate without the need for a lot of 
paperwork. The judicial branch will intervene when the 
interests of the corporations do not correspond with those of 
the justice system or the Venezuelan people." 
  Likewise, the president highlighted the importance of 
promulgating the Concessions Law because "we have great hope in 
that law, and we are preparing to launch several initiatives 
aimed at encouraging investors to take on risks through this 
concession system with certain guarantees." Caldera said his 
government is determined to encourage an awareness of tourism 
"because this sector offers great opportunities to our country 
in every aspect." He invited investors to invest in the 
country's tourism resorts. 
  Caldera cited the need for a strong and effective industrial 
policy and pointed to the special commission established to 
recommend steps to be taken by the government to orient and 
stimulate the industrial sector. 
  The country is willing to proceed with the process of 
privatization with regard to the Venezuelan Corporation of 
Guayana [CVG] and other industries dependent on this 
corporation. We are perfectly willing to enter into joint 
ventures. Caldera said the government is also disposed to 
encouraging investments in crude oil and gas ventures that may 
be beneficial to the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Fabiola Vecchionacce from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera attended an event held to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan 
Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry]. President Rafael Caldera criticized price increases 
of certain products as well as profiteering in the sale of 
dollars, which are acts of corruption that should be fought. 
That was part of Caldera's speech during the celebration of the 
50th anniversary of Fedecamaras. President Caldera pointed out 
that all sectors of society must join Solidarity's efforts so it 
can make progress. 
  Caldera also talked about the importance of opening up 
opportunities for foreign investment by providing greater legal 
guarantees. He said private and public corruption must be 
fought. Let us listen to excerpts of what Caldera said. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] We have seen how the prices of 
certain products have been increased. The Venezuelan people are 
undoubtedly being hurt by this. It is an act of corruption that 
we have to fight. We know that [words indistinct]. That is why 
an atmosphere such as this, with a spirit of friendship and of 
solidarity, can lead us to expect that we can all make an 
effort. Just as the Venezuelan private sector condemns a 
government official who steals the people's money through public 
works that are built, it should also condemn a private sector 
member, who buys dollars to resell them for an undue profit. 
[end recording] 
  In addition, President Caldera agreed with Fedecamaras 
President Edgar Romero Navas that the fight against inflation 
must not be stopped because, according to Romero Navas, the 
country requires a series of changes. Romero Navas also said 
coherence and compromise are needed in the executive cabinet. 
He said our business and political criteria on the handling of 
the country's resources should also be taken into account.

  [Text] The public transportation strike called to take 
place on Monday was observed throughtout the entire Caracas 
metropolitan area, even though the president of the Single Union 
of Independent Vehicles, the labor organization that convened 
the strike, reached an agreement at noon with the Transport and 
Communications Ministry on the payment of student subsidies. 
  Simon Ladera, president of the Single Union of Independent 
Vehicles, met with Transport Minister Cesar Quintini Rosales and 
reached an agreement, supposedly to end the strike, but the 
strike occurred anyway. 
  Ladera, after signing an agreement with the transport and 
communications minister stating that the public transportation 
sector would begin to charge the subsidized student bus fare 
rate starting this week, called on all labor union affiliates to 
return to work, but his request was not complied with. 
  Only buses operated on Monday afternoon. The subway operated 
with extra units. There were many pirate taxi cabs operating as 
well. The public transportation situation in Caracas and part 
of the interior of the country is expected to return to normal 
on Tuesday.

  [Text] Caracas, 10 May (NOTIMEX) -- Violent student 
protests to demand the restoration of subsidized bus fare rates 
occurred for the fourth consecutive day today, police sources 
have reported. The protests on Monday were concentrated in the 
western part of Caracas, where groups of students seized at 
least two mass transit buses and clashed with riot police. It 
was unofficially reported that the young students, most of them 
high school students, set one of the vehicles on fire. 
  The disturbance, which spread to five areas west of the 
Venezuelan capital, is the most serious distubance reported so 
far in the government of Christian Democratic President Rafael 
Caldera, who took office last February. 
  The students, between the ages of 16 and 19, were also 
demanding punishment for those responsible for the murder of a 
fellow classmate. The student was shot three times by a 
policeman during the protests that took place in downtown 
Caracas. 
  On Monday, transportation sector workers went on strike to 
demand a 50-percent increase in bus fares and to protest the 
government's delay in the payment of student bus fare subsidies. 
  Similar protests resulted in the deaths of dozens of 
students 
during the administrations of social democrat Jaime Lusinchi 
(1984-89), Carlos Andres Perez (1989-93), and Ramon Velasquez 
(1993-94).

<F P=106> [Report by Gustavo Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Caracas, 5 May -- Eight more military officers, who 
were charged with participating in the second military coup 
attempt, were released after President Rafael Caldera signed 
their discontinuances. 
  Rear Admiral Luis Cabrera Aguirre, the highest-ranking 
officer still being held, left San Carlos Garrison accompanied 
by Colonel Higinio Castro, Air Force Col. Jorge Garrido, 
Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Delon Romana, Lt. Col. Jose 
Villarroel, Major David Monagas, Maj. Oscar Perez Escalona, and 
Navy Captain Carlos Reyes Rodriguez. A large number of relatives 
were at the doors of the stockade waiting for the order to be 
carried out. 
  The soldiers reported to their commanding officers to submit 
a six-month leave request of sorts. During this six months the 
officers will remain under the orders of the Defense Ministry 
and will not be given operational duties of any kind. The terms 
of the discontinuance orders state that once the leave period is 
up, they may request their discharge. Because of this, the 
soldiers refused to make any statements to the media. 
  Rear Adm. Luis Cabrera Aguirre said that the defense 
minister 
gave them his word of honor that he would allow other implicated 
soldiers to return to active duty. Maj. Pedro Alastre and Lt. 
Eliecer Otaiza accepted the leave order. 
  [Alastre] We have left active duty and are simply going on 
leave. 
  [Otaiza] The leave is for six months and I will decide on 
whether to request dismissal or not later. My generation 
retires in January of next year. 
  He said that the minister of defense is studying the current 
situation of other officers involved in the second coup attempt. 
It boils down to whether President Rafael Caldera agrees to 
sign these new acquittals. 
  Col. Higino Castro is in the Military Hospital suffering 
from 
a difficult illness. 
  In Fort Tiuna's Lino de Clemente Battalion there are six 
officers under arrest who could receive their discontinuances in 
the next few hours.

export 300 tons of cocaine overseas. "I have come to discuss 
and announce the discovery of a major drug-trafficking network

hollowed-out coconuts in which the drug, presumably cocaine, 
would be hidden.

<F P=106> [Report by Alonso Zambrano] </F>
  [Text] The financial events that occurred in the country on 
Friday, when the U.S. dollar exchange rate closed at 124 
bolivares, alerted intelligence organizations that drug 
traffickers were offering dollars for between 80 and 100 
bolivares. Military intelligence sources are currently 
investigating the criminal activities carried out in Caracas, 
Maracaibo, Merida, San Cristobal, Puerto Ordaz, and Porlamar. 
  Confidential reports, which are being thoroughly 
investigated, warn about the presence of intermediaries used by 
leading cartels from the neighboring country, who reportedly 
offered dollars for between 80 and 100 bolivares, taking 
advantage of the confusion unleashed by a sudden increase in the 
dollar's value. The transactions involved attempts to launder 
large amounts of money that international drug organizations 
keep stashed along the Venezuelan border and introduce to the 
market in small amounts. 
  The confidential report talks about the mobilization of a 
considerable sum of "dirty" dollars resulting from drug 
operations carried out in Medellin, Cali, and Cucuta. The 
report indicates that, in a process like this, Venezuela is 
essential for illegal dollar transactions carried out by such 
criminal organizations.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 10 May. 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank issued a communique the night of 
2 May indicating that the Consumer Price Index registered a 3.3 
percent increase in April. This increase, added to the figures 
accumulated through March, reveals a 12.6 percent inflation rate 
for the first quarter of 1994. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 3 
May 94 p 11) 
  Today, Venezuelan Central Bank sources revealed that the 
drop 
in international reserves for April was estimated at $900 
million. According to these sources, the drop in reserves during 
the first quarter of 1994 was due to falling oil revenues, 
mistrust unleashed by the Banco Latino scandal, and huge foreign 
debt payments. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1604 GMT 5 May 94) 
  During the first quarter of 1994, Citgo Petroleum 
Corporation, a subsidiary of Venezuelan Petroleum in the United 
States, registered net profits of $43.300 million, which 
represents a 133 percent increase over profits registered during 
the same period in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 
94 p E-7) 
  Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce 
and Services, pointed out that his organization is not 
responsible for the recent outbreak of price increases resulting 
from the devaluation of the bolivar. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in 
Spanish 5 May 94 p E-8) 
  In light of the fiscal crisis, the government is considering 
selling between 10 and 20 percent of the shares of the National 
Telephone Company of Venezuela for the second half of 1994 as a 
last resort. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 94 p E-8) 
  It has been unofficially reported that international 
reserves 
dropped $900 million in April. The sources added that the 
largest drop was reported between 25 and 29 April when it was 
announced that the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela 
would be resigning and an interest rate drop was possible. 
Central Bank of Venezuela authorities said the bank will not 
release official figures for the month of April. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 94 p E-1) 
  Financial sources have reported that between January and 
April, the eight banks for whom the state has intervened have 
had to pay $550 billion bolivars. The run on the banks forced 
the institutions to turn to the government. According to recent 
studies conducted by the Banks Superintendency, overall losses 
amount to approximately 359 billion bolivars. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 7 May 94 p E- 1) 
  Between 1 January and 6 May, the bolivar has been devaluated 
22.8 percent. A marketing research firm reported that this will 
represent reduced purchasing power and greater unemployment. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 8 May 94 p 2-1) 
  The Foreign Trade Institute has reported that Colombia has 
replaced the United States as the main market for Venezuelan 
nonpetroleum products. In 1993, Venezuela exported $808.237 
million in nonpetroleum products to Colombia. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 2114 GMT 9 May 94)

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia] </F>
  [Text] In what according to his own words constitutes an 
historic moment of great importance, Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro is already in Pretoria to attend Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration as president. A few minutes after 1300 in Cuba -- 
1900 in South Africa -- the plane carrying Fidel and his 
delegation landed at Jan Smuts International Airport, 
Johannesburg, the first stop in South Africa. 
  We traveled approximately 45 km by road to Pretoria where 
workers are putting the finishing touches on the site of the 
ceremony that will end the apartheid regime by placing Mandela 
at the nation's helm. Mandela received an absolute majority of 
the votes in the first multiracial elections ever held in South 
Africa. 
  At the Arcadia Hotel where the Cuban delegation headed by 
Fidel is staying, numerous requests for interviews and contacts 
have been received from heads of states and journalists here to 
attend the inauguration. We can therefore assume that Fidel will 
be extremely busy after the inauguration. Among those who have 
asked to meet with Fidel are South African television, the PLO, 
and the heads of state of Sudan and Nigeria. 
  Before leaving Ghana for South Africa, Fidel spoke with the 
reporters accompanying him and discussed his presence at the 
inauguration of the African National Congress's leader. 
  [Begin recording] [Bel] How do you feel about going to the 
inauguration ceremony? 
  [Castro] I feel very good in every sense of the word. I am 
in 
great health. I slept well and am very happy to be on my way to 
the inauguration. 
  [Bel] What does attending Mandela's inauguration mean to 
you? 
  [Castro] It represents an opportunity to participate in an 
historic event such as this, which the peoples of Africa and the 
world are experiencing. 
  [Bel] Thank you. 
  [Castro] And also, we cannot waste a single minute, so we 
get 
there on time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What can you tell us about your 
meeting with Rawlings? 
  [Castro] I am very pleased, although it was very brief 
because he too had to get going. I am very pleased to have 
stopped here and to have contacted the people of Ghana. [end 
recording] 
  The inauguration ceremony will take place in the [words 
indistinct] a place near the Arcadia Hotel. At 1100, the new 
national flag will be hoisted and the inauguration ceremony will 
begin.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Elections To Be Held in Aruba </F>
After one Year"] 
  [Excerpt] New elections are to be held in Aruba. Last 
month saw the fall of the cabinet of Prime Minister Nelson 
Oduber of the socialist MEP [People's Electoral Movement]. 
Since then, he has not been able to reach agreement with 
opposition leader Hennie Eman of the liberal AVP [Aruban 
People's Party]. 
  The shaky MEP coalition (the party had 9 of the 21 
parliamentary seats) with the ADN [National Democratic Action] 
and PPA [Aruban Patriotic Party] splinter parties (one seat 
each) suddenly collapsed because Oduber was more than tired of 
the favoritism policies of his partners. The two political 
dwarfs repeatedly succeeded in pushing things through as they 
wanted because the MEP could not govern without them. 
  Oduber tried to avoid holding new elections by offering to 
form a cabinet comprising the AVP, which also has 9 seats, for 
the remaining three years of the government's term. Eman 
immediately said he was against the suggestion. "That would 
mean that the AVP approved the policies of the last year and was 
also jointly responsible for them. I am ready to form a crisis 
government with the MEP as long as elections are organized 
within a year," he said. 
  That was going too far for Oduber. After removing the ADN 
and PPA ministers, he remained with an outgoing cabinet of five 
MEP ministers. He preferred new elections and withdrew his 
instructions to the two negotiators he had appointed to examine 
the possibility of forming a cabinet. 
  Aruba's eight political parties are to present their lists 
of 
candidates by 8 June. Six parties are advocating maintenance of 
the separate status [from the Netherlands] as the most important 
point on their programs. The elections will be held on 29 July, 
which does not suit the AVP.

  [Text] San Jose, 8 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The presidents of five 
of the six Central American nations today analyzed in Costa Rica 
the conditions of the coffee and banana markets, agreed to reach 
a common agenda for the next American summits, and expressed 
their support for the integration of their countries and for the 
Guatemalan peace talks. The chiefs of state also agreed to find 
common grounds to negotiate a group free trade agreement with 
Colombia and Venezuela, because their countries have signed only 
bilateral agreements. 
  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, 
and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina on 8 May had 
breakfast with the new Costa Rican president and signed a joint 
declaration stating their decision to continue on the path of 
integration. 
  Honduran President Carlos Reina said the Central American 
nations "will not go" to the December Inter-American meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton "to ask questions"; "we will go 
there to discuss the interests of our region in view of the 
enormous economic market that has opened among Mexico, the 
United States, and Canada," he added. 
  Reina pointed out that Central Americans will go there 
"united and with sound proposals;" he also said the difficult 
part is not joining NAFTA (signed by those three countries); the 
difficult part lies in the negotiations themselves, because this 
agreement "reflects the economic globalization that is taking 
place under the current end-of-the-century conditions." 
  The mini-summit took place following the inaugural of Costa 
Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office today. 
This mini-summit was held to analyze the advancements in 
regional integration and to prepare an agenda for the June 
Ibero-American Summit in Colombia and the summit in the United 
States. 
  Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon Sol, who will 
take office on 1 June, also attended the meeting; however, 
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara could not attend it 
because of the general elections taking place in his country 
today. 
  Figueres told the media he talked with his Central American 
colleagues about such economic issues as maintaining a partial 
hold on the coffee harvest by coffee-producing countries to 
pressure international markets to pay better prices. 
  He added they also talked about the banana trade between the 
isthmus and the EU. This trade triggered an economic and 
political crisis in 1993 when banana import restrictions were 
enforced. 
  In their joint declaration, the presidents called on the 
Guatemalan guerrillas to keep negotiating peace with the 
government, and according to Figueres, the chiefs of state are 
hopeful these peace negotiations will successfully end this year. 
  The Ramiro De Leon administration and the Guatemalan 
National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) last month agreed, along with 
international observers, on a calendar to hold negotiations and 
on a human rights agreement to end the last Central American 
armed conflict, which dates back to 1960. 
  The Central American presidents agreed that their foreign 
ministers will meet on 23 and 24 May in Guatemala and will draft 
an agenda to forge a common front to attend the Ibero-American 
Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on 14 June. 
  Figueres emphasized that the presidents will review this 
agenda in El Salvador on 1 June, when they will meet to attend 
Calderon Sol's inaugural. He also said a similar mechanism will 
be adopted prior to attending the Miami Summit that Clinton will 
hold in December 1994. 
  At the end of the meeting, Salvadoran President-elect 
Armando 
Calderon Sol said that Central American integration is a 
well-traveled path that we must continue to follow to give 
continuity to the agreements already achieved, mainly economic 
agreements. 
  The mini-summit of Central American presidents took place at 
a San Jose hotel shortly before Figures' inaugural.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said last night 
after returning from Costa Rica it is a pity the cease-fire 
cannot be sooner, because from the humane point of view, one 
minute, one hour, or one day sooner it could save a human life. 
In addition, it could prevent additional tears, orphans, and 
widows. Thus, from the humane point of view, it is regrettable. 
  We all would like for it to be right away, immediately; that 
is why the defense minister made those proposals, because the 
people in general yearn for it, ask for it, and demand it, de 
Leon added. 
  Nevertheless, if conditions according to them are not right 
yet and we have to delay this schedule, which has been signed 
and must be respected, so be it, because we cannot do anything 
about it, he concluded.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal has stated that 
Nicaragua will not be affected by the amendment on the 
expropriation of U.S. citizens' property that was recently 
approved by the U.S. Senate, because Nicaragua has domestic 
procedures for returning property to U.S. citizens. The 
amendment on the expropriation of U.S. citizens' property 
recently approved in the United States does not affect 
Nicaragua. The amendment contains three key points required for 
its application: 
  1. If the governments that have entered a democratic 
process have not returned the property in three years. 
  2. If an effective compensation process has not been 
implemented, or if the compensation is not adequate. 
  3. If a domestic procedure that foresees the prompt, 
adequate, and effective compensation according to international 
law has not been established. 
  [Begin Leal recording] The recently approved amendment is 
not 
applicable in the case of Nicaragua. Why? Because for the last 
two years... [pauses] or for the last 18 months, we have been 
implementing an effective process. Some U.S. citizens have 
already received compensation bonds. Some U.S. citizens already 
have been given back their properties. The amendment is 
accordance with international law. [end recording] 
  According to international law, the citizenship which is 
recognized is the citizenship one had at the time of the 
confiscation. At present, Nicaragua has 22 cases of U.S. 
citizens pending, Foreign Minister Leal explained. He said that 
any local or foreign citizen who does not agree with the value 
assigned to his property by the Confiscations Quantification 
Office may resort to international arbitration. Leal said 
Nicaragua is the only country that has a high number of claims 
by U.S. citizens, but it is trying to resolve them. 
  [Begin Leal recording] We have the political will to resolve 
these cases. The president of the Republic has ordered the 
creation of a compensation system, a process whereby the 
property can be compensated for or returned. In addition, 
several ministers, such as the finance minister, myself, and 
others, are constantly meeting to review the progress of these 
cases. [end recording] 
  This amendment is applicable to more than 30 countries 
worldwide.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares by </F>
PAGINA/12 reporter Walter Goobar at the Internacional Hotel in 
Panama on 9 May] 
  [Text] [Goobar] Many people did not want to vote for you 
for fear of what the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] stands 
for. They contend that "the problem is not the bull, but rather 
the herd of cattle that comes behind it." 
  [Perez Balladares] A party comprised of 157,000 people 
cannot 
be judged on the basis of the bad reputation of 10 or 15 
members. I say that most PRD members are high-minded men and 
women. Besides, being a member of my party does not mean that 
one is automatically a member of my government. I will try to 
govern with the most qualified men and women, regardless of the 
party to which they belong. 
  [Goobar] How was it possible to rebuild the PRD, which had 
been virtually annihilated first with Noriega's administration 
and then with the U.S. invasion? 
  [Perez Balladares] They are two entirely different parties. 
Today's PRD has nothing to do with the PRD of 1989. The former 
is a democratic party, under no one's control. The latter was a 
party that had been ravaged by Noriega and the military. The 
current PDR is an entirely different phenomenon. It constitutes 
a return to our origins, to what we intended to do back in 1979 
when we founded it together with [General Omar] Torrijos. We 
recovered the democratic and civil institutionalism that had 
characterized Torrijos' administration until his death. It was 
then that Noriega and the military took over the party and 
started to subvert it. I have worked with several fellow party 
members who believe in the party's original line, and the people 
believe us because they know that our objectives are real. 
  [Goobar] How did you manage to get from Torrijos to your 
administration, skipping Noriega? 
  [Perez Balladares] Noriega's administration was an 
interregnum. I had nothing to do with it. 
  [Goobar] The pro-Torrijos grassroots voted for populism, and 
yet there is not much room for populism at present. 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe that rather than populism, they 
are searching for a system of government that implements ongoing 
dialogue and consultation. Populism costs a lot of money, and 
as things stand now there is no way we can finance it. 
  [Goobar] You will have to set into motion an adjustment 
process that the administration of Guillermo Endara could not 
accomplish. How are you going to implement it? 
  [Perez Balladares] Do you know why the previous 
administration could not effect an adjustment? Because it never 
entered into negotiations. They accepted things that were 
impossible to implement. We must start negotiating a realistic 
adjustment, one that can be implemented. It is impossible to 
make an adjustment without taking grain producers into account, 
for instance. There must be some degree of protection. 
Colombia has just obtained 80 percent protection for many of 
its products through GATT. Panama, however, is absolutely 
unprotected. It is absurd. Even NAFTA has protected goods, 
items that are not part of the free exchange system. What 
happened here is that the government was incapable of 
negotiating a structural adjustment, an applicable adjustment. 
It simply accepted the recipe without establishing the 
importance of its basic components. 
  [Goobar] Panama's main problem is unemployment. Do you 
have an economic program ready? 
  [Perez Balladares] You cannot start talking about the 
economy 
without first establishing the government's political support 
bases. We cannot just swim against the current. We must 
implement programs with social content. We must take measures 
to immediately lower our unemployment rate. 
  [Goobar] How do you do that? 
  [Perez Balladares] By building infrastructure. We have 
proposals from U.S. companies to build roads, with minority 
participation by the Panamanian Government. 
  [Goobar] Many people fear that the dismantling of the U.S. 
military bases will aggravate the unemployment problem. How 
will you coordinate these issues? 
  [Perez Balladares] In the same way the United States has 
done 
this where military bases have been closed. We must use the 
infrastructure to attract investment and create jobs through the 
construction of plants for the production of exportable 
products. Many Argentine investors are interested. 
  [Goobar] How do you explain the fact that Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber, the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias, ended up in 
a surprising second place? All pre-electoral surveys and exit 
polls placed Ruben Blades in second place. 
  [Perez Balladares] I think Arias followers' are cautious, 
and 
do not express their intentions publicly due to their long 
history of persecution. Arias' followers vote in secret. They 
do not want to express themselves publicly. I can only suppose 
that many of them said they were going to vote for Blades or 
Carles, and then voted for their own candidate. 
  [Goobar] Perhaps it was an anti-PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary 
Party] vote? 
  [Perez Balladares] I do not think so. It is very difficult 
to give your political strength to someone else. 
  [Goobar] You obtained 33.1 percent of the vote and the 
simple 
majority, which makes you president-elect. But 70 percent of 
the people did not vote for you. How do you feel about this 
fact? 
  [Perez Balladares] I must take into account that I have not 
obtained an absolute majority, but I have obtained more votes 
than anyone else. I think I represent the Panamanian people's 
desire to have a government of national reconciliation and 
unity. I understand the results in this way, and I intend to 
proceed accordingly. I have already invited some people from 
outside the party to join my government. 
  [Goobar] Panama and the PRD's relations with the United 
States have undergone good, not so good, and bad times. 
Washington, however, considers you one of the best candidates... 
  [Perez Balladares] I am very happy to hear that. I think our 
relations with the United States will be very good. Besides, we 
will be responsible for implementing the last leg of the 
Carter-Torrijos Treaty. Panama and the United States have many 
interests in common. Very few things can put us against one 
another. I am sure we will work cordially and closely united to 
implement our treaties. 
  [Goobar] According to the treaties, a condition for the 
definitive transfer of the canal to Panamanian hands is that the 
country must be able to guarantee the canal' security. How will 
a country that was left without an Army after the invasion do 
this? 
  [Perez Balladares] The era of intercontinental missiles has 
made the canal undefendable. We would not be able to defend the 
canal even if we dedicated our entire gross national product to 
create an Army to serve that purpose. The United States is not 
defending the canal against a true or possible military attack, 
either. The Panama Canal is invulnerable because it is neutral. 
No one will want to destroy it if every one can use it. There 
is no need for an Army.

  [Text] In Mexico City, four under secretaries explained to 
senators the details of the country joining the OECD. Guillermo 
Ortiz, deputy secretary of finance, Pedro Noyola of commerce, 
Andres Rosenthal of foreign relations, and Norma Samaniego of 
labor, appeared before senators and reported that Mexico, in 
joining the OECD, does not grant any privileges in addition to 
those established by local regulations. Regarding commerce, 
Noyola said this: 
  [Begin Noyola recording] We do not relinquish our status as 
beneficiaries of the general preferential treatment that 
industrialized countries apply to developing countries. [end 
recording]. 
  Mexico remains entirely free to sign regional commercial 
agreements, he said. 
  Ortiz of finance said financial openings were a difficult 
point in the negotiation but that a gradual basis was 
established for operations of banks, stock exchanges, and 
insurance companies; operations that will be revised in 1998. 
  Rosenthal of foreign relations said that Mexico did not join 
a wealthy men's clubs. He explained that joining the OECD will 
not magically solve the national growth's shortages and 
deficiencies. Samaniego of labor said that Mexico's advantage 
in this area is that the nation will have access to advanced 
studies on labor and job markets. 
  The senators were informed that in this year's first 
quarter, 
foreign investment increased 89.5 percent over last year. In 
the first few months of 1994, more than $5.2 billion have been 
invested in creating 34 new corporations under the new foreign 
investment law. Sixty-three percent of these investments 
originated in the United States. Following the meeting, the 
senators will decide whether or not to approve Mexico's joining 
the OECD.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today confirmed the government's decision to transform the Falda 
del Carmen facilities into "Argentina's space activities center." 
  Menem thus stressed that the facilities where the 
controversial Condor-2 missile was developed and built will be 
used for "the production of civilian goods and services alone." 
  The president made these remarks in opening this morning the 
2d Euro-Latin American Space Forum [II Jornadas 
Euro-Latinoamericanas del Espacio] at the Libertador Hotel in 
Buenos Aires. Representatives from European and American space 
agencies, research institutes, universities, and companies are 
attending this forum. 
  Representatives from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico 
will lecture on the development of their space programs. 
Teledialing [telediccion] -- the remote gathering of data, 
using satellites -- especially for the exploitation of natural 
resources and environment conservation, will be among the main 
issues for discussion. 
  During the opening ceremony Menem was joined by Conrado 
Varotto, the National Commission for Space Activities [CNAE] 
chairman; European Space Agency Chairman Michael Lefevre; and 
Senator Jose Figueroa. 
  In his speech, the president emphasized "the peaceful" goals 
of the space projects, and noted that an Institute for Higher 
Space Studies [Instituto de Altos Estudios Espaciales] would be 
operating in Falda del Carmen, in Cordoba Province. 
  After emphasizing the importance of science and technology, 
Menem noted: "Historically, and especially over the past 
decades, Argentina has not been using its gray matter, and given 
the reduced possibilities for development existing here we, 
incredibly enough, became exporters of brains." 
  The president said: "We are proud to say that this trend has 
been reversed now." He then noted that space activities have 
been enhanced. 
  Menem pointed out: "The CNAE was legally established in 
1991. A National Space Program [Plan Espacial Nacional] is 
being drawn up now, and must be completed in September. This 
program will establish long-term strategic planning. This 
planning is now possible thanks to the economic stability." 
  Menem noted: "In a breach of trust, I can say that one of 
the 
program's key points involves using the so-called light 
satellites [satelites livianos] that are able to supply a number 
of scientific and practical services to our territory and to 
third countries." 
  Menem said: "The Satellites SAC-B and SAC-C must be 
described as pioneer." He noted: "Argentina is gaining 
experience, and has great potential in the field of space 
activities." 
  Before delivering his speech, Menem met European Space 
Agency 
astronaut Claude Nicolier, a member of an expedition that spent 
11 days in space to service the Hubble space telescope.

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- On Thursday, President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada spoke of the danger of 
"narcoguerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like those of 
Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug enforcement 
policy is not quickly defined. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said this new policy, which he will 
present 
to Congress next August, must not be imposed from abroad. He 
spoke to a local newspaper, alluding to the problems created in 
Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug enforcement and to 
eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the largest cocaine 
raw material producing zone in the world. The chief of state 
said: "Trafficking is a very serious problem for all sectors of 
society and it affects Bolivian relations with the rest of the 
world." 
  The president said he was worried about the lack of a 
consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of 
the coca produced in El Chapare -- approximately 60,000 tonnes 
per year -- ends up in drug production. 
  "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas 
region is taken to El Chapare, and it all goes to produce drugs. 
The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug 
cartels or narcoguerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said. 
  Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration, 
Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug 
Enforcement Council presided by Foreign Minister Antonio 
Aranibar and comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman, 
Sustainable Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and 
Minister of Government German Quiroga. 
  This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not 
solutions 
imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this 
reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United 
States. "This is a far too important for them (the United 
States) because after many years they have recognized the need 
for shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a 
proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada 
said.

  [Text] Santiago, 9 May (EFE) -- Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza reported today that this week the 
Chilean Government will extend an official invitation to Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Santiago. 
  He said Robaina's visit will be part of a tour that the 
Cuban 
foreign minister will make of Southern Cone countries in the 
next few months, adding that the invitation "entails nothing 
special" within the relations between the two nations. 
  Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations in 1973. 
Consular-level relations were reestablished in 1990 at the end 
of the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990, 
following the election of Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994) as Chilean 
president). 
  Insulza said the Chilean Government considers an exchange of 
opinions with the Cuban foreign minister on the Cuban situation 
and the political situation in the hemisphere will be "very 
useful." 
  He added that there is no specific agenda for Robaina's 
visit, but he emphasized, among other topics, the commercial 
blockade and the sidelining of Cuba from the inter-American 
system, a situation that has impeded official contacts with the 
Caribbean country, [would be discussed]. 
  Other sources reported that the agenda will also include the 
signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement that Chilean 
officials announced last week, when Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa reiterated that the reestablishment of 
diplomatic relations is not a short-term objective of the 
Chilean Government. 
  Concerning relations, Insulza said that even though some 
events in Cuba -- like the dialogue with exiles and the most 
recent economic measures -- are regarded as positive, the 
political regime continues "to pose substantive obstacles" to 
the reestablishment of relations. 
  "We have no diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the decision 
to reestablish them should be made by the president (Eduardo 
Frei)," Insulza said. 
  He added that the Chilean foreign policy "seeks to maintain 
relations with all countries," but this calls for "a political 
evaluation," because there must be a "consensus" among all 
sectors "with due consideration for the interests of the nation."

<F P=106> [Interview with Constitutional Court Justice Carlos Gaviria </F>
Diaz by program director Dario Arizmendi; place not given; from 
the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Arizmendi] Dr. Carlos Gaviria Diaz is the 
judge who proposed the Constitutional Court's ruling lifting 
penalties on the consumption of personal doses of certain drugs. 
[passage omitted] Good morning, Dr. Gaviria Diaz. 
  [Gaviria Diaz] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] What do you think of the controversy unleashed 
in the country and the witch hunt that has apparently begun 
against certain members of the Constitutional Court? This witch 
hunt is apparently against the judges who studied two articles 
of the law having to do with lifting penalties on the 
consumption of personal doses of certain types of drugs? 
  [Gaviria Diaz] Dario, you have clearly said that it is a 
true witch hunt. Actually, the most unfortunate thing about 
this is the fact that the mass of opinion is entirely emotional; 
that is, it does not really understand the scope of the ruling 
or is not even familiar with the ruling. Actually, this mass of 
opinion is jeopardizing the Constitutional Court, specifically 
the judges who approved lifting penalties. It makes us targets 
of very emotional reaction from the most fanatical groups. 
  It is surprising that this type of reaction was begun by the 
president of the Republic and that the candidates -- 
particularly those who have the best options for winning the 
Presidency of the Republic -- are emulating this radical 
prohibition in order to curry public favor. Thus, I am very 
surprised about this reaction, but not because I did not think 
such an important ruling would entail challengers in the 
country. I am surprised by the sources of these challenges and 
what they are doing. They are encouraging the most destructive, 
emotional, fanatical, and dangerous reactions. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, in addition to the issues 
broached by the president of the Republic and by some 
candidates, the most outstanding aspect just a few hours 
following the announcement of the Constitutional Court's ruling 
was the statements made by some judges who voted against the 
ruling. They openly criticized the ruling, and they even 
encouraged the public to do so. 
  [Gaviria Diaz] I do not want to adopt the same attitude they 
did. I deeply respect their points of view, which are different 
from ours, because everyone is entitled to his own opinion. 
However, I do regret they do not have that feeling of cohesion 
with the court. The rules of the game were observed, and once 
the ruling is approved the ruling belongs to the entire court 
and not just to some justices. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Gaviria Diaz, when will the entire ruling be 
announced? 
  [Gaviria Diaz] The entire ruling will be announced next 
week, when Court President Jorge Arango returns from President 
Mandela's inauguration. 
  [Arizmendi] As far as you know -- because you are the author 
of the proposal -- will this ruling take into consideration 
certain restrictions as the president of the Republic 
respectfully suggested when he delivered a radio message before 
knowing the full text of the ruling? 
  [Gaviria Diaz] There is a total lack of knowledge of what 
the mission of the court is, and I want to be very clear about 
this: People are acting as if the court had arbitrarily decided 
to lift penalties on drug consumption, as if we were acting as 
legislators, or deciding on something that simply pleased us. 
That is not the mission of the court. The mission of the court 
is to compare and decide if the contents of a law clash or not 
with the Constitution. In the event the court determines these 
contents clash with the Constitution, then the court is obliged 
to withdraw it, regardless of national or international reaction. 
  In the second place, it is being said that now children and 
pregnant women are going to be using drugs, that drugs will be 
used in schools, and so forth. Dario, it is legal to drink 
liquor in Colombia, but I ask you: Is liquor being consumed in 
the schools? It is legal to smoke tobacco in Colombia, but are 
people smoking in church? With this, I am clearly saying that 
the court does not have to go into these details. The ruling 
simply makes general statements to this effect, but police 
regulations and other institutional regulations will restrict 
and control the consumption of drugs, just as it is does with 
the consumption of alcohol and tobacco. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Salvador, 10 May (EFE) -- Government officials 
reported here today that Cuban Leader Fidel Castro will arrive 
in the Brazilian city of Salvador, Bahia State, on 11 May for a 
12-hour stopover on his return trip from South Africa. 
  Castro today attended the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as 
the first black president in the history of South Africa. 
Castro will arrive in Salvador at noon on 11 May. 
  Spokesmen for the Bahia State Government have said that 
Bahia 
Governor Antonio Imbassahy will receive the Cuban president at 
the Salvador air base. 
  The sources added that Castro will stay in Bahia for 12 
hours. 
  They noted that hey have no information on Castro's schedule 
for his brief visit to Salvador. 
  The Cuban leader was quite impressed by Salvador, the first 
capital of Brazil, when in June 1993 he attended here the 
"summit" of Ibero-American heads of state and government.

  [Text] Lima, 9 May (EFE) -- On 9 May, Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori stated Peru is "entirely sovereign" and if its 
counterterrorist laws are flawed, Peruvians will correct them. 
Thus, Fujimori answered several "recommendations" to study the 
country's legal situation by a New York Bar Association mission 
at the end of an eight-day visit to Peru. The visiting lawyers 
recommended that Peru's counterterrorist laws be amended and 
made more flexible. "We will make them more flexible as we 
acquire more experience," Fujimori said. He added that any 
changes should not "jeopardize" the peace process. 
  Commenting on the U.S. lawyers' "recommendations," Fujimori 
asked "why should we accept their cooperation now, when they 
left us alone for 12 years during which time 25,000 people 
died." The president added: "The responsibility is ours alone; 
should there be any mistakes, we will correct them." Fujimori 
emphasized that delegations of lawyers "can keep coming" to 
Peru, but it is up to the Peruvian Government to decide what 
suits the country best. 
  The New York lawyers' "recommendations" include not trying 
cases of aggravated terrorism or high treason in military 
courts, not keeping terrorist prisoners incommunicado, and 
giving lawyers free access and the right to meet in private with 
alleged terrorists while in prison. 
  The New York lawyers also recommended that all innocent 
people arrested on terrorism-related charges in Peru should be 
pardoned, and that the anonymity which protects judges and 
witnesses in high-treason trials should be lifted.

  [Text] On 27 April, Congress unanimously approved prison 
sentences of no less than 8 and no more than 15 years as 
punishment for those who cultivate, promote, help with, or 
finance poppy plantations, including those who transfer or 
commercialize the seeds of this plant, which is the base product 
for heroin. 
  The bill, which was based on a draft submitted 2 months ago 
by the executive branch and debated by the Justice Committee, 
establishes a prison sentence of no less that 2 and no more than 
8 years for those who commercialize poppy seeds that would 
produce less than 100 plants. 
  The bill also indicates that the poppy plantations that are 
destroyed "by any means, as long as they do not affect the 
preservation of the environment, must be done so under the 
control and responsibility of the provincial prosecutor, who 
must draft the appropriate document explaining the action." 
  The land used for cultivation, the equipment, and others 
things used directly to commit the crime will be seized, and as 
soon as the court hands down its sentence they will become the 
property of the Agricultural Ministry. 
  Referring to the land, preferably this will be awarded to 
peasants without land, according to a clause of the bill that 
the president sent to Congress for approval. 
  Those who have committed this crime will not be eligible to 
take advantage of penitentiary benefits such as sentence 
reductions for work carried out or for helping in the 
educational sector; pardons; or semi-conditional or conditional 
release. 
  This bill is the first of its kind in scope as it is a 
frontal attack against the proliferation of poppy plantations 
within the national territory. 
  At the beginning of the week, EL COMERCIO revealed a report 
on the magnitude of illegal poppy cultivation, which is 
especially attractive for the drug traffickers because its 
derivatives (opium and heroin) fetch a much higher price than 
the illegal derivatives of the coca leaf.

<F P=106> [Report by Gregorio Salazar] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez admitted 
yesterday, upon returning from the United States, that a 
significant portion of the funds obtained as a result of 
currency devaluation will be used to pay the foreign debt. As 
Minister Sosa was about to get into his car, which by the way 
has a private license plate, he was approached by a reporter who 
asked: 
  [Unidentified Reporter] What will the government do with the 
additional income obtained from the sale of dollars? 
  [Sosa] Well, there are various aspects. First of all, the 
Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV] is trying to reduce liquidity 
through the zero coupon bond mechanism and is trying to 
establish a more permanent method. On the other hand, you must 
remember that our budgets include foreign debt servicing which 
must be paid in dollars, which means that it will cost us more 
bolivares. So we already know where those bolivares will go. 
  [Reporter] Can those bolivares be used to pay the debt? 
  [Sosa] Obviously ... 
  Previously, Sosa had answered several questions from 
reporters who inquired about the differences between the 
auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls. "The 
auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls are two 
completely different things. The word auction itself implies 
that there are no controls, because I understand it means that 
you can offer `two,' I can offer `three,' and another person can 
offer `two and a half.' Controls would mean that if I say `two' 
that is it." 
  Sosa said there will be no alternate to the BCV as a source 
of dollars. 
  [Reporter] Is the BCV also trying to control the large 
number 
of dollars being sold? 
  [Sosa] Evidently, it is trying to handle this -- price and 
volume -- step by step. I believe, however, that it is being 
handled beyond the normal needs. 
  He had previously been asked whether the mechanism to 
auction 
foreign exchange would be permanent or temporary. "I think it 
will last for some time. BCV is always trying to establish the 
measures that best fit the circumstances. For instance, the 
system the bank used a little more than a year ago, the 
"crawling peg standard" -- I do not know how to translate that, 
it sounds like a spider climbing a wall -- was different from 
the one used previously. The new mechanism fits reality more 
closely, and I think it will work just fine. 
  Sosa turned philosophical when he was asked what he had 
meant 
when he said the auctioning of U.S. dollars would be permanent. 
"God is the only permanent concept in life. All of the material 
things and man do not last forever, and whoever says the 
opposite is wrong. I meant that the system would last one year, 
maybe longer." 
  Someone told him that, according to National Convergence 
Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui, auctioning is the best exchange 
control. "Well, I will ask him to explain that to me when I see 
him." 
  Sosa expressed confidence in the auction mechanism 
established by BCV. He regards the system as convenient because 
financial markets are gradually returning to tranquillity. 
According to the finance minister, the Economic Cabinet 
discussed his trip to Washington and divided the cabinet into 
four sectors: political, social, infrastructure, and economic. 
  He said that in the United States, he met people willing to 
enter joint ventures with CVG [Venezuelan Guayana Corporation] 
in aluminum and steel manufacturing. He also thinks that another 
plant for manufacturing methanol for export could be built in 
Venezuela. Sosa, who is always optimistic, confidently expects 
inflation to decline and interest rates to fall by the end of 
the year. 
  Later, he said flatly that Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. 
[PDVSA] 
will not be privatized. "There are very good possibilities for 
foreign capital, with technology, resources, and market 
potential, to join PDVSA subsidiaries in certain projects." A 
very large investment is required in the Orinoco Strip, Orinoco 
Delta, eastern Monagas, and the southern Sucre projects, which 
are open for investment. "This does not mean that PDVSA 
subsidiaries or PDVSA itself will be privatized," he said. 
  Asked how international reserves will be affected, he 
answered: "Let us hope that trust will make them increase. I do 
not think this system will affect the reserves. If they are 
affected in any way, it will be for the better."

  [Text] Today, Cuban President Fidel Castro met privately 
with his South African counterpart, Nelson Mandela. Castro 
attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony in Pretoria yesterday. 
  Early this morning, Castro visited Mandela at Mandela's 
official residence, where they talked behind closed doors. In 
remarks to the press yesterday, Castro said new possibilities 
for cooperation between the two countries are opening up, as the 
African National Congress assumes power. He added that because 
of the ties of friendship and affection that exist between the 
two countries, with no other country in the world are there such 
broad possibilities for cooperation as there are between South 
Africa and Cuba. 
  After meeting with Mandela, Castro granted the South African 
Broadcasting Corporation, the local television network, an 
exclusive interview at the Arcadia Hotel, where he and all the 
members of his top-level delegation are staying. 
  Regarding his first visit to South Africa, whose army fought 
Cuban troops in the struggle for the independence of Angola and 
Namibia, Castro said there are two South Africas and two moments 
in the history of South Africa. He said there was a moment of 
strong confrontations but that now there is a new South Africa, 
where there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.

the policy of apartheid, held a friendly talk with outgoing 
South African President Frederik de Klerk during the luncheon 
that followed black leader Nelson Mandela's inauguration. Castro 
was introduced to de Klerk by Mandela. Welcome to South Africa, 
de Klerk said to Castro; and through an interpreter Castro 
responded: I wish you success. Mandela then introduced Castro to 
General Georg Meiring, chief of the South African Army, and the 
two men shook hands. In 1987, South African troops confronted 
Angolan and Cuban troops in Angolan territory. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia] </F>
  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro granted a news 
conference to the Cuban reporters accompanying him on his visit 
to South Africa. Fidel discussed possible Cuba-South Africa 
ties, and Mandela's historic victory. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this 
month, 
an ANC [African National Congress] representative discussed the 
preceding events, and explained that once Nelson Mandela was 
inaugurated, South Africa would proceed to establish diplomatic 
relations with Cuba. That is their intent. They even included 
this in a document known as the New South Africa Foreign Policy 
Charter. 
  In view of the fact that we have already attended the 
inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet 
representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a 
reality? 
  [Castro] [Words indistinct] of our relations with Mandela, 
the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We have had 
close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we are 
family. Regarding foreign relations [words indistinct] 
conditions, the closer our friendship with a country, the less 
we ask to establish ties. We allow circumstances and the 
appropriate moment to determine the establishment of ties to 
occur. In the special case of South Africa at this time, we 
could not make a definitive statement. 
  I have been received here like a brother, like a son. We 
have 
not pressed the issue of formal ties, however. I believe that 
perhaps tomorrow, it will be brought up in the talks with the 
foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with the 
foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela. 
Perhaps, he will bring this up and ties will be established 
immediately. We will not bring it up however. We must bear in 
mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to 
formalize ties, rather than bringing it up like a demand or as a 
request from us. 
  It seems something, however, [word indistinct] that those 
ties will be established quickly because there are few countries 
with whom we have stronger ties in common -- kinship and 
fraternal ties. 
  Today I greeted almost every minister. I did not speak with 
ministers from other countries. We talked like old relatives. I 
am convinced all of them want the quick establishment of ties, 
but out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not 
exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready. 
Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and 
Cuba. 
  [Reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and South Africa 
had great differences because of Angola. Did you ever think 
then, or later, that you would be here today in the former 
capital of apartheid? 
  [Castro] Well, there are two South African nations. We have 
to return to its history. For specific reasons, strong clashes 
took place. Now, however, there is a new South Africa in which 
such clashes no longer exist, just peace, harmony, respect, and 
affection. 
  Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to 
answer. [Words indistinct] the independence of Angola. We were 
in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning of intervention by 
foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our support -- for 15 
years. So many things happened. We did not have a strong 
presence, but it was strong enough because we could not, nor did 
it depend on us alone, to attain a position was the problem. 
[sentence as heard] 
  In Angola, we fought with the greatest selflessness. The 
rest 
was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not 
Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we 
helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would said that our 
support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only 
efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything 
we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were 
confronted, difficult but not through our fault. Cuba fulfilled 
its duty. Cuba contributed to solve the highly difficult 
problems that arose. I do not want to criticize anyone. I 
believe today is not a day to criticize. Perhaps history will 
record this. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Cuban President Fidel Castro is scheduled to 
arrive tonight in Salvador, Bahia State, on Brazil's Atlantic 
coast, on his way from South Africa, where on 11 May, the 
reestablishment of full diplomatic ties with South Africa was 
announced. 
  This will be Fidel's fourth trip to Brazil. Friendship 
organizations have mobilized to welcome Fidel, who has made 
apparent his admiration for the Brazilian people. His previous 
visits have had great repercussion in Brazil and copious 
coverage by its media. 
  Cuba and Brazil maintain active bilateral relations and 
commercial exchanges have increased lately. Brazil has commended 
Cuba's health system and also used Cuban medicines, like the 
meningococcal meningitis vaccine. Fidel's previous visit took 
place last year during the summit in Bahia, which everyone 
agrees is very similar to Cuba, and whose people are as friendly 
and ebullient as the Cuban people. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 11 May features the program, "Straight Talk," 
with host Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE and guest 
Maribel Acosta from Cuban television. 
  In relation to Decree-Law 148, Rodriguez opens the 
discussion 
by asking: How are we going to identify the money hoarders? 
Acosta answers that, "the measures against the money hoarders is 
the only popular, truly popular measure of the group of measures 
being implemented to heal national finances. This is not news. 
It has been clearly stated that the other measures are not 
popular measures, that they involve sacrifices, and the people's 
understanding is needed." 
  Acosta adds that other measures cannot be implemented 
without 
first implementing measures against the money hoarders. 
Rodriguez adds that the money hoarders are corrupt, in addition 
to being great corruptors. 
  Returning to how to identify money hoarders, Rodriguez 
states: "We would have to check with the authorities as well as 
the police. I believe they have been working at this for awhile. 
A year ago, I was told certain files were being put together to 
identify who these people were and how they operated." Acosta 
points out that the decree-law mentions "disproportionate 
amounts in relation to legal income." 
  Acosta adds: "Official reports reveal that 80 percent of the 
Cuban population has direct or indirect ties with the black 
market, and this is illegal." Rodriguez goes on to say that the 
decree tries to confront those "people who are millionaires" and 
that these people are well known. Rodriguez adds that in El 
Cerro Municipality, "a very modest area, where most of the 
neighborhoods are humble, and where most people live even below 
a modest level," he witnessed a money hoarder's son receive 
privileged treatment and found it offensive. 
  Rodriguez stresses that "this virus is an ulcer that is 
almost becoming a social class" and is developing its own 
corresponding ideology. Rodriguez adds that hoarders "live 
differently and think differently." 
  Acosta adds: "Many people have told me that this should have 
been done a long time ago. This reveals the essence of the 
people's opinion to which you referred. This is the most popular 
measure. Therefore, it is necessary to implement this measure 
quickly, correctly, in an organized manner, and fairly in every 
sense and in every sector, upon whomever it ought to be 
implemented because if this is not done and our principles are 
not preserved, which evidently this decree is trying to do, then 
it demoralizes the people, demoralizes the Revolution, and could 
demoralize it to the point of becoming the beginning of a 
gradual erosion of power. If the Revolution loses its power, 
then the essence of what we are discussing becomes meaningless 
-- if measures are not taken against profiteers in a country 
were measures of adjustment and strong economic measures are 
being taken." 
  Rodriguez points out that the actions ought to be drastic, 
but implemented without fear. He closes by saying: "I believe no 
one should be exempt, no matter who the individuals are, and 
regardless of their backgrounds. I believe the law has to be 
applied to anyone who has acted illegally, has become wealthy 
illegally -- the decree specifies this clearly -- not only 
through theft and illegal operations, but also through 
embezzlement within state entities or entities with links to the 
state. I believe there are going to be such cases. If this is 
done thoroughly, it is likely that such cases, which we might 
even lament, will come up."

<F P=106> [Speech by Emile Jonassaint at his installation ceremony as </F>
"provisional president" at the Legislative Palace in 
Port-au-Prince on 11 May -- live; passages within quotation 
marks in Creole] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the Senate of the Republic, 
Gentlemen Deputies, Honorable parliamentarians including both 
senators and deputies, dear colleagues of the Court of Cassation 
of the Republic and members of the judicial power, Mr. Commander 
in Chief of the Haitian Armed Forces, distinguished members of 
the High Command, Officers, Noncommissioned Officers, Soldiers, 
Ladies and Gentlemen Dignitaries of the State, Reverend 
representatives of the Episcopal Conference and the Protestant 
Church, Rosicrucian and Freemason brothers, dear Voodoo friends, 
citizens: 
  "Today, Haiti says it will not die. [applause] It must live 
so all its sons can suck at its breast. Courageous men and women 
have decided to administer a serum to the country until it 
leaves the hospital bed of total and complete embargo, which 
tries to weigh it down. We do not promise miracles because the 
sickness is serious and the medicine is very expensive. 
  But we call on all fellow citizens to be patient. We ask 
them 
for a chance so the doctor can work on them to bring recovery, 
but the sick person must want to be treated. The sick person 
needs the important surgical operation of elections. The sick 
person needs the vitamins of unity. Let us hold hands to save 
our country. Haiti is ours, it is mine, it belongs to all of us. 
All of us together must save it." [applause] 
  It has been said with good reason that roses and lilies do 
not have a future, but that the fate of mankind places itself 
above that of the bird that sings and dies. [applause] I had the 
distinguished honor of speaking in Arcahaie on behalf of the 
Senate of the Republic 41 years ago on the occasion of the 150th 
anniversary of the creation of our bi-colored flag. After 
briefly recalling the terrible sufferings endured by our 
ancestors in Africa, in the holds of slave ships, and in the 
land of Saint-Domingue, I spoke of our soul, thirsty for 
justice, peace, and love, with a sincerity that seems to have 
moved a great number of my fellow citizens. 
  Today, there is only one remedy that can cure all the 
diseases of Haiti. It is love. [applause] 
  As has always been said by a great radio station director, 
we must bury every hatchet. We can no longer continue to kill 
one another. It is no longer possible. In the current state of 
affairs, we must all, together, look at ourselves and say our 
mea culpas because the responsibilities are shared. There is not 
just one guilty person. We are all guilty to one extent or 
another. [applause] 
  It is time that we got rid of the mortal certainty that any 
solution for our country will come from elsewhere, that any 
progress will necessarily be imported. We alone know our 
realities, our real needs, our objectives. Those who pretend to 
want to help us must take that into account. Still, it is 
necessary that we ourselves know these needs, that we listen in 
our land to our people, to ourselves. God helps those who help 
themselves. 
  It is through this contempt for our deep realities, this 
misunderstanding of our problems, this lack of knowledge of our 
objectives that we are sinking under the weight of injustice by 
our foreign partners. If the painful situation that we are 
facing today has any merit, it is to make the majority of 
Haitians aware that the solution lies within themselves. It is 
because of this search for a Haitian solution that the 
parliament has decided to call on the president of the Court of 
Cassation to temporarily fill the function as head of state, 
following the duly observed defection of the executive power. It 
is my duty to answer history's call positively. [applause] In 
fact, for you and with you, I accept this challenge. I am 
calling on the patriotism of all the nation's sectors to help me 
bear up under the challenge. 
  The national context and the current international context 
are extremely difficult -- internally, an impoverished and 
hungry nation, destroyed and nonexistent infrastructures, a weak 
and still weakening economy, uncontrolled commerce, stalled 
industry, an underequipped Army, a fragmented society, shaken 
institutions, a devastated ecology, a country to which 
everything seems to be lost. Everything remains to be won, 
however. Externally, a desorientated New World Order, a 
misinformed foreign opinion, a delinquent humanitarian policy, 
corrupt international law, [applause] a disjointed planetary 
system deprived of a global strategy in which a double standard 
is mercilessly applied, according to special interests or media 
surveys. The man of good faith observes, frustrated. To quote 
Charles (?Melon), president of the French parliamentary group, 
French Democratic Union: The triumph of illusion and trickery, 
seduction over reason, humbug over argument. 
  At a time when it is appropriate to criticize the elite and 
the established order, they are accused of all sins, relying on 
the ineffectiveness of denial and abusing the credulousness of 
the crowds. The real reasons for the problems are then 
displaced. The people, blinded, swoop down on the designated 
fall guy. This facet of demagoguery is handled brilliantly by 
several modern leaders under the standard of democracy and human 
rights. It is an imposture. 
  I earnestly implore the international community to grant 
this country the deadline needed for restoration of truth. May 
it pause to observe, allowing the provisional government to make 
emergency decisions and take measures on the local level for the 
protection of the fundamental rights of its citizens, especially 
in the case of the clandestine departures of refugees, risking 
the lives of men, women, and children at sea. In addition, 
despite the abuses the Republic of Haiti suffers through the 
blind ambition and self-importance of some of its sons, today, I 
make the solemn commitment to respect the sacred principles of 
the law and the clauses of our international commitments. 
[applause] 
  A little more than 50 years ago, in the magazin LE TEMPS of 
Port-au-Prince, Doctor of Philosophy Abbot (Gingrat) asked this 
question: Where is the truth about social problems, about moral 
problems, and about religious problems? He answered by saying: 
The man, the demigod who could answer these questions and answer 
peremptorily by invoking universal persuasion and the death of 
all doubt would resolve the enigma and cure the diseases of this 
world. [applause] 
  This is the reason, this is the reason [repeats himself] we 
ask all our fellow citizens to unite because one single man 
cannot solve the problem of Haiti. I take this opportunity to 
offer my keen congratulations to our valorous officers and 
soldiers who intervened, who said no at a moment [words 
indistinct] was reigning in the country. [applause] 
  To the honorable members of the parliament, I can say only 
one word because in order to thank them, as I have said many 
times before, I would have to use the language of the gods, or 
at least the one of [word indistinct] or of what St. Jean 
(Chrysostome) called the golden mouth. I will just tell them 
thank you. 
  Tomorrow, history will remember their gesture, and all those 
who, today, pillory and hold them up for public condemnation 
will bow before their courage and their patriotism. [applause] 
  A final, parting word, because we must be brief. May we all 
fulfill our duties with love, truth, and justice so that 
fellowship and peace finally prevail in our unfortunate country. 
[applause] May the God of our hearts, of the universal church, 
of the eternal religion bless us and help us! [applause] May the 
protective gods of the homeland and all our [word indistinct] 
surround us with their protection as an impenetrable rampart, 
now and forever. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 May (EFE) -- Today, Acting Prime 
Minister Robert Malval described as illegal the appointment of 
Emile Jonassaint as Haiti's provisional president and stated 
that he does not recognize "this act, which is contrary to the 
Constitution." He added that a situation has been reached 
whereby "those entrusted with the mission of safeguarding 
national sovereignty are the persons who endanger it." 
  Jonassaint was appointed provisional president by a group of 
senators headed by Bernard Sansaricq and with the support of the 
Armed Forces and Army Commander Raoul Cedras. 
  Malval, who resigned in December but who remained as acting 
prime minister until constitutional President Jean Bertrand 
Aristide appoints his replacement, called on "patriots and 
responsible people to oppose this forceful coup, which is 
against the Constitution and the Governor's Island agreements 
signed" in New York. This agreement establishes Aristide's 
return to power, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a 
group of military officers. 
  Meanwhile in Washington, President Aristide's spokesman, 
Jean 
Claude Martinau, said Jonassaint was president of an illegal 
supreme court, therefore his presidency is illegal. Martinau 
upholds that this government will have the same fate as previous 
governments appointed by the military and that he will be used 
as a puppet. 
  Victor Benoit, leader of the National Congress of Democratic 
Forces party, condemned the action and called it "illegitimate 
and illegal." Benoit said he will stay home and stop going to 
the Ministry of National Education, Youth, and Sports. 
  Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the extreme right Mobilization 
for National Development, backed Jonassaint's appointment as 
acting president. De Ronceray believes the Senate carried out a 
patriotic act by designating Jonassaint and that the decision 
will "put the house in order." He added that "we must prepare 
to successfully face all international community challenges." 
  U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing sent Jonassaint 
a 
letter requesting that he respect the Haitian Constitution, in 
which the judge took part. [sentence as received] Swing 
described the act as illegitimate and called on Jonassaint to 
join those who wish to defend that Constitution. 
  Likewise, the union sector condemned Jonassaint's 
appointment 
and said this will facilitate U.S. diplomatic games to occupy 
the country. A Haitian Workers Central leader said Sansaricq, 
Jonassaint, and those who back this maneuver will be the persons 
primarily responsible for a military intervention. The labor 
leader believes that all Jonassaint's acts as president are null 
and without a future. The labor leader also said that 
Jonassaint's appointment is a coup within a coup d'etat against 
Aristide. 
  The National Federation of Popular Organizations 
[Confederacion Nacional de las Organizaciones Populares], 
through its Secretary General Banes Cherestal, described the 
appointment as a new coup d'etat that will worsen the situation 
of extreme poverty the people of Haiti are in. Cherestal asked 
himself who does Senator Sansaricq work for and what is his true 
goal. The union leader made several proposals to resolve the 
crisis and mentioned among them that Gen. Cedras resign, as he 
promised within the framework of the Governor's Island 
agreement. He also proposed amnesty for the military members, 
that Aristide appoint a prime minister, Aristide's return in a 
reasonable time period, and that UN sanctions be lifted.

  [Text] The head of the Haitian Army, General Raoul Cedras, 
was interviewed on U.S. NBC Television. The general, questioned 
on a possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti to allow the 
return of President Aristide, said it would be a gross mistake. 
For the Army commander in chief, the solution to the crisis 
should come through dialogue. Regarding those who attempt to 
reach Florida by boat, Gen. Cedras indicated they are economic 
refugees. Rothschild Francois filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] The first subject touched on 
with Gen. Cedras on Sunday 8 May on NBC was the situation of the 
boat people. To the Army chief, those Haitians who go to sea are 
economic refugees. They go searching for greater economic 
welfare and the American dream, he added. The general pointed 
out that under the administration of President Aristide, in 
April 1991, 400 Haitian boat people were able to reach Florida's 
coasts. Clearly, to the first in command of the military 
institution, the economic situation is responsible for the 
refugees. 
  Questioned on the proposal made by some sectors of the 
United 
States who favor a military invasion of Haiti to restore 
President Aristide to power, Gen. Raoul Cedras asserted that 
such a decision would be a gross mistake and indicated that for 
him, the solution to the crisis would come through dialogue: 
  [Cedras in French, with passage-by-passage translation into 
English] You know that Haiti is a very small country. One can 
always ensure trial of strength [?over night, over right]. I 
personally think that a military invasion would be a gross 
mistake. 
  [Unidentified reporter in English] Would you resist such an 
invasion, or would you escape? 
  [Cedras] It is not the Army which is [word indistinct]. It 
concerns a country, a country which must be indemnified, a 
country which has its laws, its rights. You are asking me if I 
would escape. I would tell you that personally, I do not have 
any importance. The nation's highest interests order me to 
support dialogue to reach a solution to the crisis. 
  [Francois] On the thorny question regarding his resignation 
as head of the Army, and his willingness to respect the 
agreements made on Governors Island, Gen. Cedras explains, and 
we quote: The problem has always been wrongly posed. People 
focus more, he says, on the superficial points included in the 
agreement. For me, the Governors Island agreement is a global 
plan which would allow for reconciliation among Haitians. I 
was quoting the Army commander in chief. If the parliament 
passes the amnesty law, would you be ready to resign as head of 
the military institution and allow the return of President 
Aristide to Haiti? 
  [Cedras] At this point in the situation, everyone in Haiti 
and abroad should favor dialogue as the only way for us to reach 
a satisfactory conclusion. 
  [Unidentified reporter] General, that does not really answer 
my question. Would you be willing to accept an amnesty law and 
step aside for President Aristide? 
  [Cedras] I am telling you that, when, in the Governors 
Island 
agreement, we considered the amnesty law, it was based on a 
global plan. Now, we are talking about the amnesty law. What 
about the other measures? What about those who did not respect 
their word? 
  [Francois] During his interview on 8 May with NBC, Gen. 
Cedras condemned the sanctions, saying they should have been a 
means not a policy. He hopes the international community will 
reconsider before the total embargo takes effect in less than 
two weeks. 
  Gen. Cedras, who was questioned by NBC from the Teleco 
[telephone company] Building, asked U.S. President Bill Clinton 
to review his policy toward our country. [end recording]

Mexico, was sentenced to 40 years in prison by the fourth 
district court judge. Garza explained that Felix Gallardo was 
tried for the murders of U.S. DEA agent Enrique Camarena Salazar 
and Mexican pilot Alfredo Savala Avelar. 
  [Garza] Felix Gallardo received a 40-year sentence, and the 
Special Prosecutor's Office has agreed with this decision. 
  [Chavez] Was any appeal filed regarding compensation for 
damages or the fine? 
  [Garza] He was sentenced to 40 years in prison, fined 1,485 
new pesos, and asked to pay some 1,550 new pesos in compensation 
for damages. 
  [Chavez] Felix Gallardo was accused of planning the 
kidnapping and murder of U.S. DEA agent Camarena and Mexican 
pilot Savala Avelar on 8 February 1985. He was accused of 
crimes of homicide, kidnapping, and torture. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Senate took a very important step in today's 
session by approving the protocol by which Mexico joins the 
OECD. In order to join the OECD, which includes the world's 
most developed nations, Mexico will no longer be in the 
so-called Group of 100, in other words the Nonaligned Movement, 
in which Mexico participated as an observer. Mexico is no 
longer in that group. 
  Senator Porfirio Munoz Ledo participated in today's debates. 
Of course, he was not very pleased and said that Mexico is now 
a poor country within an organization of rich nations. 
  [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] We have resigned what, on many 
occasions, has been described as leadership, which in fact was 
Mexico's recognized historical moral authority over developing 
nations to become the poor relatives of an organization with 
which we have no historical links. I will not mention the case 
of Turkey, out of our respect and friendship toward that 
sovereign nation. [end recording] 
  Munoz Ledo stressed that Mexico's withdrawal from the 
Nonaligned Movement at this time will be very costly. 
  Senator Jesus Rodriguez y Rodriguez, president of the 
Finance 
Commission, reacted to Munoz Ledo's statement. He described 
Munoz Ledo as an archaic politician who has remained in the 
seventies and who never sees anything positive when the country 
takes a step forward. He said that by entering the group of 
developed nations, Mexico seeks to be in a better position for 
international competition. 
  [Begin Rodriguez y Rodriguez recording] I did not hear any 
good arguments from him. I only heard miserable and pathetic 
expressions. Although his words may have some impact, I want to 
hear arguments. I would like to say that I am afraid that as in 
the case of the legendary Rip van Winkle, the opposition senator 
has remained in the past, he has remained in the decade of the 
seventies. He moved into the eighties with some difficulty 
because his personal participation was necessary, but the truth 
is that he continues talking about a world and an economy.... 
[pauses] first he talks about the postwar period and then about 
[word indistinct]. The reconstruction of Europe is way back in 
history. [end recording] 
  Senator Rodriguez y Rodriguez said Mexico's entrance into 
the 
OECD is a fundamental step toward achieving the development for 
which we are striving.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Zapatist National Liberation Army </F>
Subcommander Marcos by Hermann Bellinghausen in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, Chiapas State, on 6 May] 
  [Text] "From the beginning, we noticed the government has 
indicated clearly that it is hard-liners who are imposing their 
will," EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] Subcommander 
Marcos said here during an interview. Marcos added: "If there 
is no democracy, a civil war will ensue in Mexico." The 
government "is making a mistake again by taking a hard-line 
position," Marcos reiterated. 
  The morning after the meeting between Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Samuel Ruiz, and EZLN 
representatives, Subcommander Marcos commented on the meeting 
and analyzed the situation. First, he said: "We agreed to meet 
on EZLN territory for security reasons." 
  Subsequently, he mentioned three issues that were discussed. 
First, each party talked about what each member of the San 
Cristobal peace talks had done. Second, they discussed the 
national and regional situations. Third, they reviewed the next 
steps to take. 
  Marcos summed this up by saying: The EZLN lauded the courage 
demonstrated by the peace commissioner and the mediator to enter 
a territory that is not under the federal government's control. 
Later, the EZLN conceded that the mediator maintained the 
rapport and cleared the way for the dialogue. The commissioner 
referred to proposals made by the federal government in the 
32-point document and two statements. He has worked hard in 
seeking a consensus on the proposals and to discuss investment 
and social programs in the various federal organizations. The 
EZLN indicated that, in agreement with its latest communique, it 
has resumed consultations and that in a strict time limit of 
several weeks, it would be ready to resume the dialogue. 
  In this regard, Marcos believes "it is premature to talk 
about the dialogue, or to set a location and date. The EZLN, in 
accordance with its tradition, must consult all of its militants 
everywhere." In turn, "the committee will issue a statement." 
  Marcos added: It is possible to finish the consultations. I 
do not see why they should be interrupted again. In the 
meeting, we reached the conclusion that we must respect and wait 
for the EZLN to make its decisions. 
  Marcos spoke calmly. Throughout the meeting, Major Mario and 
Major Moses accompanied him on the same esplanade that witnessed 
the meeting between peace negotiators in Chiapas yesterday. We 
are facing that "different" juncture Monsignor Ruiz mentions so 
often. It is a time that appears to move slowly, but that [words 
indistinct] speed-up mechanisms themselves. 
  Marcos said: As we speak, consultations are progressing in 
communities located in the depths of the jungle, and we expect 
answers some time next week. 
  Marcos also expressed his concern over the national 
situation. A process of political peace and negotiation does 
not exist, Marcos stated categorically. Marcos summed it up 
this way: "The federal Army's efforts to support the process, 
remain on the sidelines, and avoid doing anything that might 
hinder negotiations were acknowledged during the meeting." 
  Marcos said: "Both the mediator and the commissioner said 
the 
federal Army has withdrawn its troops, and this shows that the 
sectors involved are continuing the peace process. 
Subsequently, we talked." 
  Marcos continued by saying: We certainly had a more 
pessimistic view of the national situation. Regarding the 
federal Army, we reiterated that there had not been such a 
withdrawal of troops. More soldiers have been deployed in the 
state than in January. But the Army's attitude has changed, 
avoiding provocations that emerged after the dialogue. Both 
officials and soldiers have showed more understanding vis-a-vis 
the causes of our uprising, but a reduction in the number of 
troops certainly has not occurred. Their belligerence has 
diminished, and we welcomed that change in attitude, but without 
conceding a reduction in troops because, as far as we know, 
there has only been a redeployment. 
  Marcos added that, regarding the latest government 
decisions, 
EZLN followers told Camacho and Ruiz: The issue is not merely 
the seeking of peaceful as opposed to violent solutions. From 
the beginning, we have noticed the government has indicated 
clearly that it is hard-liners who are imposing their will. 
  According to Marcos, the situation does not seem to be 
heading "toward a process of political peace and democratization 
that will eventually become a solution to the EZLN problem, but 
everything seems to indicate that the government is preparing to 
resolve this problem by force. 
  Examples of this include: "The government's major 
administrative and police efforts are being channeled into 
repressive measures, the purchase of war material, and the 
creation of this new super-secretariat, headed by Farell, that 
replaces Cordoba Montoya. All repression has been focused on one 
person who has stood out in trying to smother the country's most 
important sector, namely, the labor sector." 
  The Zapatist analysis prompts concern. Here is what Marcos 
said: If there is no democracy, regardless of the Zapatist Army 
and its political and military role, there will be a civil war 
in the country. The government is making a mistake again by 
taking a hard-line position against the people's demands, as if 
this were the solution to problems. We mentioned at the meeting 
that the government was making a mistake in its assessment and 
that the results would be a civil war in Mexico. We insist that 
this assessment is wrong. 
  At this point Marcos believes the political road of 
negotiations should be followed, not the road of force. Marcos 
said: As opposed to the Zapatist Army, with which one can talk 
even though it does not have a face, in the case of a civil war 
there will be no control, security will not count, and there 
will be no one to talk to. 
  Marcos reiterated that the main problem is the lack of 
democracy, "and even if the Zapatist Army is wiped out, this 
will not be the solution, unless it is a revolutionary solution." 
  He added: "We see with concern the threat of civil war. In 
other words, the Zapatist Army sees this as a disaster [de la 
chingada]." What is going on in the country "does not convince 
anyone," he commented. 
  The meeting with Commissioner Manuel Camacho and with Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz "was brief, lasted only two hours (although 
officially it was reported to be seven hours long), and reached 
an agreement to "keep the channels of communication open." 
  Marcos said: "There are provisions to hold meetings such as 
this one in safe places, and the only safe place for the 
Zapatist Army is in the territory it controls." 
  Marcos also said: The coming months (May, June, and July) 
are 
"months of hunger" in the jungle. Planting has just concluded; 
there are no crops, no money. Access to assistance and goods 
has been cut off by the military cordon. It might be good to 
recall, on this occasion, that the people who are going hungry 
are also armed. 
  In addition, it has been learned that the majority of the 
humanitarian aid goes to non-Zapatist communities in the jungle, 
or it goes to members of organizations such as National Peasant 
Confederation and Rural Association of Community Interest. No 
matter what, the people of the region are headed toward "months 
of hunger" in the wake of the military cordon, which is 
affecting the life of the community and heightening shortages 
and isolation. 
  Marco indicated: After holding consultations, there will be 
a 
response if there are conditions that will enable the resumption 
of the dialogue. During the meeting, which was not a dialogue, 
"rather, it was an exchange of reports," according to Marcos, 
other matters were discussed. 
  Marcos said: Some things were discussed to help broaden 
mediation, things that would help maintain the dialogue. One 
preliminary step is to extend the gray areas to other points, 
given the provocation caused by the presence of belligerent 
forces, such as the Altamirano Association of Cattle Breeders. 
  Once again, reference to Morelia came up, the conflicting 
common land next to the seat of that municipality. If peace is 
to be established everywhere, this place must also be included. 
  The subcommander's conclusion about the meeting was that the 
session was ephemeral: Nothing specific was agreed upon because 
we are waiting for a reply from the consultation. 
  After the interview concluded, the subcommander told 
reporters "off the record" [previous three words in English] 
that the PRI candidate is expected to arrive this morning in 
Chiapas. At the same time, Commissioner Camacho and Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz would be giving their news conference in San 
Cristobal. One of Marcos' aides heard this on the radio this 
morning. 
  The PRI is going to haul off all of the reporters to Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, Marcos joked. No, they are not going to leave 
Camacho alone because they still fear him. 
  During the conversation with the subcommander, as in other 
winds that blow in the southeast, a clear signal can be seen: 
The presidential campaigns and their results, which will come 
on 21 August, have no choice but to pass through the state of 
Chiapas. National solutions must also pass through here.

<F P=106> [Article by Patricia Munoz Rios] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the Commerce and Industrial Development 
Secretariat [Secofi] revealed that Mexico has already prepared 
the package of products for which it will demand immediate 
inclusion during the negotiations Mexico will hold with the 
United States and Canada to expedite the liberalization process 
agreed upon in NAFTA. 
  Reports indicate that only a few details regarding this list 
of products to be submitted for negotiation are pending review. 
Those details are being studied jointly with the production 
sectors because these sectors have directly demanded that their 
products be included in this package. 
  Agricultural-livestock and fresh and processed fruit 
products 
head the list of products for which Mexico will demand immediate 
inclusion. Mexico is negotiating this immediate inclusion 
through NAFTA for the med-term. 
  Secofi revealed unofficially that talks to expedite 
schedules 
for tax-elimination [calendarios de desgravacion] were still in 
the preliminary stage, agendas have barely been agreed on. 
  This is occurring despite the fact that the U.S. and Mexican 
Governments signed a commitment "as part of NAFTA supplemental 
negotiations to conclude the review process of the tariff 
acceleration 120 days after the treaty's entry into force on 1 
January, that is, 1 May." 
  The deadline has passed. The United States seeks to expedite 
particularly the elimination of taxes from products such as 
wine, plate glass, electric appliances, hardware materials, wood 
products, among others which make up the long list of goods in 
the negotiations, however. 
  Secofi even promised to disclose the list of products to be 
negotiated by the end of the week of 25 April or the beginning 
of the week of 2 May at the latest, but this never happened. A 
report indicated that this package is entirely ready for 
negotiation, however. 
  One line of products for which Mexico wants an early opening 
is that of processed fruits and vegetables. In this line, 62 
percent of the exports must go through a 10-year period before 
tax exemptions go into effect. Twenty-one percent of sales to 
the United States face a 15-year protection period. Only three 
percent of the market is tax free. 
  It is important for Mexico to have an early opening in this 
line of goods because this is one of the few lines in which the 
country has a positive trade balance. The main products in this 
line of exports to the United States, asparagus, broccoli, 
cauliflower, however, must wait 10 years before the 
tax-exemption process begins. Tax-exemption on frozen orange 
juice will begin in 15 years; 10 years for frozen strawberries. 
The tax-exemption deadline for processed and preserved 
tomatoes, for processed avocados, and, in general, for 
vegetables, is five years. Mexico will request immediate tax 
exemptions on these products.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Farabundo Marti National </F>
Liberation Front Party National Council, read by Jorge Shafik 
Handal, general party coordinator, at party headquarters in San 
Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
National Council, during its regular afternoon and evening 
meeting on 9 May, discussed as the agenda's main point the 
FMLN's participation in the Legislative Assembly. The FMLN 
adopted the following conclusions and agreements: 
  1. The FNLN's legislative programs and plans were made known 
and approved. These define the goals and tasks that will be our 
deputies' work in the struggle for democracy and social justice. 
The Council agreed to publish and make known this document of 
guidelines and actions to be undertaken that constitutes a 
commitment to the Salvadoran people. In this way, we place it 
at the disposal of the diverse peoples and national sectors for 
debate and enrichment. 
  2. In keeping with Article 30, Paragraph 1, of our by-laws, 
Comrade Deputy Manuel Orlando Quinteros Aguilar, alias Gerzon 
Martinez, has been appointed leader of our legislative faction. 
  3. Regarding the events that occurred during the 1 May 
installation of the Legislative Assembly and the events that 
followed, the National Council: 
  A. Ratifies and supports the decision by the Political 
Commission not to participate in the Legislative Assembly's 
Board of Directors. ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has 
turned this Board into a tool of its hegemony and antidemocratic 
actions through the surprising and illegal last-minute reform of 
its internal regulations. Under these conditions, the 
Assembly's Board of Directors does not reflect the proportional 
composition that resulted from the 20 March elections and 
exacerbates the internal regulation that requires deep reform 
for democratizing the Legislative Assembly's actions. 
  The Council reaffirms that the FMLN's participation in the 
Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors depends on democratic 
reform of the regulations. 
  B. It ratifies and supports the contents and terms of the 
communique issued by the FMLN's general coordinator on 3 May 
regarding this event. 
  C. It censures the action of seven deputies who, having been 
appointed candidates by the FMLN, which is committed to the 
struggle for democracy, bowed to ARENA's maneuver by 
participating in the Board of Directors' election and by 
accepting posts on the board. It also censures Joaquin 
Villalobos, who without being a deputy has played an important 
role as instigator of this action. 
  The National Council believes that the behavior of these 
eight comrades during and after 1 May constitute a persistent 
divisive action that violates the norms that rule the FMLN's 
endeavors and that undermine the foundation of its unity 
agreement. This is undoubtedly a serious transgression against 
our party's principles, goals, and by-laws and a harsh blow to 
the hopes that hundreds of thousands Salvadorans have placed in 
the FMLN. 
  D. Before and after 1 May, the eight mentioned comrades have 
had the chance to participate, with all the rights that the 
by-laws grant to FMLN members, in the debates and the 
decisionmaking. Nevertheless, they did not openly present to the 
Political Commission their intentions nor did they attend this 
National Council meeting to present and debate their opinions 
and positions. The by-laws approved and signed by all state: 
Taking into consideration the significant value of party unity, 
and within the framework of free discussion of ideas, it is 
required that decisions be adopted by consensus. If this is not 
achieved, the minority will respect the decisions of the 
majority. Article 8 of the by-laws. 
  The National Council point outs that the argument that 
within 
the FMLN there is systematic confrontation of three against two 
is false. It does not correspond to the reality in innumerable 
cases of unanimous and consensus votes of four to one and 
diverse compositions of three to two. 
  E. Given the above reasons, the National Council agrees to: 
  E.1. De-authorize as FMLN representatives Deputies Eduardo 
Sancho, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, Juan Ramon Medrano, Fidel 
Recinos, Eli Avileo Diaz, Sonia Aguinada Carranza, Francisco 
Mena Sandoval, and Joaquin Villalobos. 
  E.2. Suspend all these comrades from the posts to which they 
have been assigned by the National Council. Ask the National 
Resistance and the People's Revitalizing Expression to correct 
the conduct that has given way to this situation and to propose 
substitutes for approval by the Council to participate in the 
continuing internal debate and in the task of party management. 
  E.3. Convene a special national convention in June -- after 
canvassing the opinion of the party's rank and file -- to ratify 
these National Council agreements and to adopt the corresponding 
decisions to normalize the situation and foster the FMLN's 
struggle and development. In light of the special national 
convention, the National Council asks the party's diverse 
district and sectoral structures to hold a broad consultative 
debate.

  [Text] San Salvador, 10 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Eduardo Sancho, 
one of the eight leaders of the former Salvadoran guerrilla 
organization Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), 
today rejected the National Council's decision to separate them 
from their posts in the organization. 
  Sancho -- former commander "Ferman Cienfuegos" -- said at a 
news conference that "we do not accept the decision of the 
National Council to suspend the members of the ERP [People's 
Revitalizing Expression] and RN [National Resistance] from the 
Political Commission because that is the first step toward a 
permanent expulsion." 
  Shafik Handal, coordinator general of the FMLN, made the 
announcement following a prolonged meeting of the FMLN National 
Council. Representatives of the ERP and the RN did not attend 
the meeting which ended early this morning. 
  Seven [as received] ERP and RN members voted for deputy 
Gloria Salguero -- of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance 
(Arena) -- for president of the new Legislative Assembly during 
the installation ceremony on 1 May. In return, the ERP's Ana 
Guadalupe Martinez and the RN's [Eduardo] Sancho were elected 
vice president and secretary, respectively, with the support of 
39 deputies of the right wing Arena. 
  Sancho declared that the other three factions of the FMLN -- 
the Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces (FPL), the 
Communist Party of El Salvador (PCES), and the Revolutionary 
Party of Central American Workers (PRTC) -- "are not yet 
democratic, and that is the honest truth." He added: "We reject 
and do not accept this measure, and we do not view it as a 
decision," and he stressed "we still belong to the FMLN." 
  The document prepared this morning by the council points out 
that its members decided to "suspend all of these companeros 
from posts assigned to them by the National Council," and asks 
the RN and the ERP to "correct the behavior that has given rise 
to this situation and to propose replacements for approval by 
the National Council." 
  From another quarter, Walter Araujo, deputy of the ruling 
ARENA, said that independent of the internal problems of the 
FMLN, his party will seek "reconciliation in order to gain the 
support of 84 deputies for the bills, initiatives, and 
agreements to seek greater unity. The FMLN's problem does not 
involve the other political parties: it is very much their own 
problem," Araujo declared.

  [Text] San Salvador, 10 May (ACAN-EFE) -- A former 
Salvadoran guerrilla organization said today that, with Ernesto 
Perez Balladares' victory in the Panamanian presidential 
elections, that nation's civilian society "reaffirms its 
conviction of the defense of national values." 
  Sigfrido Reyes, of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN) International Relations Secretariat, told ACAN-EFE 
that, with the victory of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), 
"Panamanians have issued a clear message to those inside and 
outside that country who proposed a revision of the 
Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977. 
  Reyes added that Perez Balladares' victory on Sunday "is an 
important sign that will have positive effects on the 
correlation of democratic forces in Central America." He added 
that the PRD's triumph was inspired in the "ideals, values, and 
nationalist views of General (Omar) Torrijos, who struggled for 
many years to restore the country's autonomy, particularly 
damaged by the canal treaties which gave the United States 
absolute control over the zone.

<F P=106> [Paid "Political Statement" entitled "Clarity and Truth To </F>
Confront Manipulation and Confusion" issued by the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, on 8 May; place not given] 
  [Text] During this week, statements have been made and 
media campaigns have been conducted to create confusion and 
distort the truth. Those statements, in particular, are not 
simple opinions but, taken jointly, clear indicators of 
concerted objectives to negatively affect the negotiation 
process. 
<H5>  Cease-Fire, Reality, and Perspective </H5>
  It is truly worrisome to see a recalcitrant sector of 
private 
initiative, which has taken upon itself to represent all 
Guatemalan businessmen, and hoist old banners in new times. It 
is especially troublesome when this sector attempts to actualize 
positions that have not only been defeated in national and 
international arenas, but are totally against the spirit and the 
letter of a previously agreed negotiation, which was held with 
UN participation. 
  To propose, as the CACIF [Coordinating Committee for 
Agriculture, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations] 
board has done, that first there must be a cease-fire so that we 
can later negotiate what is "pending" is nothing more than a 
clear indication that they do not want the peace negotiations to 
have any political, economic, or social content. The 
negotiations are only intended to get the URNG to give up its 
weapons, without solving any of the problems that caused and 
maintain the armed conflict. 
  The current CACIF board's reasoning is not naive. It 
attempts to have an emotional impact on the population. This 
old and out-of-place concept has been, precisely, one of the 
causes of the long and hard war we have endured. The 
persistance of this reasoning is a serious and hazardous 
obstacle to the attainment of peace. To achieve peace it is 
imperative that the previously agreed upon fundamental issues be 
seriously and thouroughly discussed, agreed upon, and complied 
with. 
  After we reach agreements on the fundamental issues on the 
agenda, using CACIF's words, the "pending" issue would then be 
the cease-fire. In this case, changing the order of the factors 
completely alters the product. Anybody knows and the current 
CACIF board is especially aware that nobody is going to 
negotiate the causes of a conflict when it has already ended. 
  If, as they proclaim, they want peace, they must actively 
and 
assertively participate, with a positive attitude and social 
sensitivity, to find solutions for the country's major problems. 
They should also propose initiatives that will contribute to the 
advancement of negotiations. 
  This is the point of definition: Take advantage of the 
present opportunity to rectify their position, join society, and 
stop going against the people's interests. 
  The same can be said about the defense minister's position. 
He knows perfectly well that this topic unavoidably leads to an 
interruption in negotiations. It is contradictory that he 
carries out sensationalist publicity stunts in an attempt to 
take by surprise the good faith of nationals and foreigners. 
  The national and international public are aware that most of 
the problems and sufferings of people in the conflict area are 
caused by the Army's houndings, persecution, and military 
actions against the civilian population, especially in the areas 
where Communities of Resistant People and programs for returning 
refugees exist. 
  It is not with a cease-fire declaration that we will resolve 
our problems. The effective and proper way is to zealously and 
thoroughly comply with the Global Human Rights Agreement. In 
the end, the current propaganda and sensationalist measures 
attempt to diminish the Global Human Rights Agreement will not 
guarantee the people's rights nor lead the country anywhere. 
  We, thus, call for reflection. We ask and demand coherence. 
Anything else is diversion and disinformation to avoid 
compliance with obligations and the verification process. They 
are an obstacle to continuing on the set path. 
<H5>  Commission for the Establishment of Human Rights Violations </H5>
  We consider it positive that the commission's debate on the 
issue is being endorsed by Army members, and that the need for 
its establishment is becoming increasingly evident. 
  The URNG is compelled to state its position on concepts that 
provoke confusion. Since the beginning, the URNG has considered 
that the establishment of such a commission was, and is, not 
only essential but also not postponable because it is a 
significant commitment to eradicate impunity, guarantee 
democratization, and eradicate forever terrible events which 
tarnished and darkened our history. The truth is essential for 
all this; it is not vengeance, as some have depicted it. 
  This commission's functions must center on the issue of 
human 
rights violations so no one may misconstrue its purposes and 
goals. This must be an essential starting point. Events 
determine history. An investigation commission must start with 
incidents of human rights violations and issue a statement 
concerning this. 
<H5>  Statements Which Obstruct A Process </H5>
  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has repeated, in an 
inexplicable and absurd way, the speech given by former 
President Serrano on the negotiation issue. This is 
reprehensible, above all because it counters agreements that 
were signed and ratified after 10 January. 
  To proclaim nonexistent military victories and to proclaim 
the URNG's alleged defeat at the political and international 
level, casts doubts on the government's willingness to 
negotiate, gives evidence of profound contradictions and 
divisions, and represents obstacles to the peace process. The 
current administration's only achievement is the signing of 
agreements on the negotiation process. The president and his 
government must be aware of this. 
  His prestige as human rights ombudsman has been criticized 
all over the world. His only alternative is to comply with, and 
implement, the human rights agreement. He must also give 
specific proof that he intends to continue with the negotiation 
process. 
  If the president wants to fulfill his role, and if he wants 
this role recognized at the national and the international 
level, he must avoid traditional and recalcitrant speeches. It 
is incongruent and detrimental to repeat them.

Commander Gaspar Ilom, and Carlos Gonzalez, secretary, Central 
Committee of the PGT [Guatemalan Labor Party]

  [Excerpt] This weekend Acisclo Valladares Molina was again 
sworn in as attorney general and Ramses Cuestas Gomez as chief 
of the Public Prosecutor's Office and prosecutor general. 
  [Begin Guatemalan President De Leon Carpio recording] As 
president of the Republic, as the ombudsman for Human Rights, as 
a Guatemalan citizen committed solely and exclusively to his 
country and its people, I once again express my deepest 
conviction that Guatemala must change. Each step we take to 
strengthen democracy, reaffirm human rights, fight impunity and 
corruption, reestablish lost moral values, and regain the 
credibility of our institutions will allow us to advance in the 
right direction -- toward our common well-being and 
comprehensive, complete human dignity. 
  This is one of those steps that will allow us to walk 
serenely on the road to a comprehensive peace; peace not only as 
the absence of war, nor as the end of the internal armed 
conflict which, thank God, is about to end; but peace as an 
achievement that includes justice and social stability. [end 
recording] 
  Valladares Molina will have advisory and consultative 
functions in various government activities. He will also 
conduct a special project involving tax evasion, and will have 
to deal with the eradication of corruption in the Customs 
Department. Cuestas Gomez will be responsible for judicial 
investigations in order to facilitate the fair administration of 
justice. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Luis Humberto Guzman, president of the Nicaraguan 
Parliament, traveled today to the United States to investigate 
the background of a report [as heard] on property and its 
effects in Nicaragua. Before leaving for Washington, the head 
of parliament said that he will discuss the issue of Nicaragua's 
foreign debt, inasmuch as it is the National Assembly's duty to 
make some contribution to this effort. 
  [Begin Guzman recording, in progress] ...having an effect in

  Guzman did not say with whom he will meet in Washington, 
adding he will also discuss the issue of property and the 
background of a law promoted by Senators (?Martinez and Helms) 
concerning properties owned by U.S. citizens in several 
countries, including Nicaragua. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] With regard to this measure, we 
want 
to see what the National Assembly can do to contribute to 
finding a solution to this problem. [end recording] 
  Guzman said that it is urgent to solve the problem of the 
properties. A recent government report disclosed that 37 
percent of the demands by 125 U.S. citizens with 412 properties 
had been resolved. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais has also said that an 
important aspect is that a procedure is functioning in Nicaragua 
and the U.S. Government has approved it. 
  [Begin Pallais recording] This process is under way, seeking 
to solve all cases as soon as possible. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares on the </F>
occasion of being officially proclaimed the winner of the 8 May 
presidential elections at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama 
City -- live] 
  [Text] Members of the National Vote-Counting Board, 
magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, candidates here with us 
this evening, ladies and gentlemen: 
  Regardless of who has been the protagonist, Panama's 
democracy and the people of Panama very much wanted an event 
such as today's, an event in which a group of trustworthy 
citizens have clearly confirmed the verdict of the polls. 
  In Panama, thanks to men and women like you, the democratic 
consolidation process, which in other regions takes decades, has 
been accomplished in a very short period of time and has been 
built on very solid bases. This is the conclusion of an effort 
that has earned the praise of the foreign media and has been a 
surprise for some of our own fellow citizens. 
  Disputes, recriminations, confrontations, and arguments are 
now behind us, and behind us are also, let's hope forever, 
political campaigns stained by violence and elections blemished 
by doubts. 
  The country began to change beginning early Monday morning, 
not because one or another candidate had secured the majority of 
the votes of the Panamanians, but because everybody accepted 
unaffectedly and like a gentleman the results of the previous 
day. 
  Those of us who have acquired the commitment of promoting 
reconciliation in the country, accept it with joy but calmly, 
enthusiastically but without any intention of boasting before 
others about this privilege from the voters. 
  I must also say, and let this be a public tribute of 
respect, 
that our adversaries exhibited the patriotic altruism and the 
political generosity of closing, on the elections night, the 
wounds that the political confrontation could have opened. 
  They also deserve our homage. [applause] 
  In January 1990, taking a step that at that time was not 
understood, I visited President Endara to express our 
dissatisfaction with some measures that had been adopted. I 
told him that I categorically would initiate an opposition to 
his government. He told me that during his mandate, a 
democratic opposition would enjoy broad guarantees. 
  Today I must acknowledge, very sincerely, that I opposed his 
government and that President Endara showed respect for the 
opposition. This acknowledgment is necessary today because all 
of us have witnessed his effort to pave the road to an orderly 
transfer of power. 
  I cannot mention all the persons who made the democratic 
fiesta we now enjoy possible. But it would be unfair of me to 
fail to point out the exemplary behavior of the Public Force, 
yesterday arbiter of politics, and now the guarantor of 
constitutionality. The Justice and Peace Commission and the 
electoral delegates deserve the same public admiration. The 
respect they earned and the impartiality they exhibited were 
enough to quench infrequent outbreaks of violence and to 
guarantee to the citizens that this electoral struggle would see 
only three weapons: ideas, enthusiasm, and votes. 
  Since all the citizens, regardless of age or sex, were the 
true heroes of this democratic event, I want to conclude my 
statement by paying homage of respect and admiration to the 
three forefathers who, to the satisfaction and pride of 
everybody, comprise, and let us hope, will continue to comprise, 
the Electoral Tribunal. [applause] 
  They made us get used to listening to a song whose words are 
now a beautiful truth: We are the builders of the fatherland! 
  Thank you! [applause]

  [Text] As announced by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA on Sunday, 
industrialist Gabriel Lewis Galindo, Christian Democratic 
Legislator Jose Antonio Sossa, and cattle rancher Carlos Sousa 
Lennox have accepted cabinet positions in the administration of 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares. This has been 
confirmed by the nominees themselves. 
  Lewis Galindo, who will be the foreign minister as of 1 
September, was Panama's ambassador to the United States in 1977 
when the Torrijos-Carter Canal Treaties were signed. He opposed 
the regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega from 1987 to 1989. 
The new foreign minister is also the brother of Samuel Lewis 
Galindo, presidential candidate for Solidarity Party who came in 
next to last in Sunday's election. 
  Sossa, who accepted the post of attorney general, is a 
founding member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), a 
traditional and staunch adversary of the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party]. 
  Sousa Lennox, linked to the ruling Arnulfist Party and 
former 
president of the National Association of Cattlemen (Anagan), 
will be the minister of agricultural development (Mida). 
  Research by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA disclosed on Sunday as an 
exclusive report said that Perez Balladares has offered the 
Public Health Ministry to Carlos Garcia de Paredes, Raul (Baby) 
Arango Gasteazoro will hold the Ministry of the Presidency, 
Mitchel Doens will be the Ministry of Government and Justice, 
and Felix Gonzalez Santizo will be the minister of commerce and 
industries. 
  The Education Ministry has been offered to Stanley Muschett, 
rector of the Santa Maria La Antigua University (USMA) and 
chairman of the Justice and Peace Commission. 
  According to Perez Balladares, the other ministries will be 
held by PRD members, while Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria 
-- also from the PDC -- might be ratified in his post.

<F P=106> [Statement by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential </F>
candidate of the Arnulfista Party in the 8 May presidential 
elections, in Panama City on 11 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening, dear reporters. This evening, I 
gathered the Arnulfista Party's National Directorate and 
Consultative Board to discuss with them the offer made to me by 
Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares of two cabinet ministries in his 
administration. 
  The National Directorate and Consultative Board have issued 
the following statement in response to the offer made to the 
Arnulfista Party. It is a unanimous decision, and it states: 
  The National Directorate and Consultative Board of the 
Arnulfista Party, faithful to the doctrine and thinking of Dr. 
Arnulfo Arias, categorically and definitively reject the 
proposal to occupy ministries in the next administration. 
  The Arnulfista Party's ever upright position will be to 
defend, to the utmost consequences, the freedom and democracy 
the Panamanian people are enjoying today under the leadership 
and guarantees of an Arnulfista administration. 
  I reiterate that our glorious party's position will be to 
carry out a clear, constructive, and patriotic opposition, thus 
giving content and solidity to the authentic democracy for which 
the civic-minded fought and of which we are the most legitimate 
guardians. [applause]

  [Text] La Paz -- The Armed Forces general staff is 
assessing a series of state intelligence and security reports 
suggesting that Chapare, in Cochabamba Department, be declared a 
"military zone," taking into account that a series of factors in 
the region could place the country's political and social 
stability at stake. 
  The reports state that the presence of individuals linked to 
terrorism has been detected in this tropical region of 
Cochabamba. It is even suspected that they may have some 
relationship with subversive groups operating in Peru, also 
precisely in coca production areas, such as Upper Huallaga, 
which has characteristics similar to those of Chapare. 
  The reports mention, moreover, that the presence of drug 
traffickers that have come into Bolivia from Colombia has been 
detected. These traffickers are allegedly inciting the peasants 
to oppose the implementation of programs to eradicate surplus 
coca plantations, through demonstrations that recently almost 
resulted in violent clashes. 
  According to the intelligence report submitted to the Armed 
Forces high command suggesting that Chapare be declared a 
military zone, these and other factors detected in the area 
represent a worrisome prospect. National institutions must work 
to prevent the unleashing of conflict that could place internal 
security and the country's sociopolitical stability at stake. 
  Moreover, military sources who asked not to be identified 
stated that high-ranking government echelons are concerned over 
the existence of acts of sabotage against the alternative 
development program. This seriously affects the country as a 
whole regarding the fulfillment of bilateral agreements with the 
United States. 
  The Bolivian and U.S. Governments have reached drug 
enforcement agreements, including the gradual elimination of 
surplus coca plantations, in which large sums of money have been 
earmarked for alternative development programs, interdiction 
actions against drug trafficking, and aid to help maintain 
Bolivia's balance of payments. 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada recently voiced his 
concern over the presence of domestic disturbance factors in 
some regions of the country when he referred to the possibility 
of "narco-guerrilla" groups appearing in the country and warned 
of the need to look into this possibility more carefully. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that there are signs of underlying 
violence in Chapare, and that if adequate and timely preventive 
measures are not taken the region could become a territory 
occupied by international drug cartels or even 
"narco-guerrillas." 
  The president of the Republic's concern also reached 
Congress, where it was stated that the possibility of violent 
actions promoted by drug traffickers and terrorists in Chapare 
"is real," according to recent comments by Cochabamba Deputy 
Hector Cartagena, of the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union]. 
  Military sources consulted by LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz stated 
that the mentioned reports are being carefully assessed in order 
to reach a specific institutional evaluation, but that in any 
case it is up to President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, in his 
capacity as the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, to make 
the decision regarding the possibility of declaring Chapare, in 
Cochabamba, a "military zone."

  [Excerpt] The indigenous groups living in the eastern part 
of Bolivia will for the first time have an opportunity to 
participate in planning policies for the development of their 
people, who number approximately 500,000. A consultative group 
that groups together all of the grassroots indigenous 
organizations represented in the Confederation of Indigenous 
People of Eastern Bolivia has been created. 
  The consultative group will meet every so often with the 
Ethnic Affairs Secretariat to discuss and approve programs. It 
is worth noting that the secretariat respects the indigenous 
peoples' organizational structure, which is divided into three 
groups: a people's directorate, an intermediate organization, 
and the grassroots, with which the dialogue must be held through 
the mechanisms established for that purpose. [passage omitted]

Autarky Block in Brasilia -- live] 
  [Text] The Army continues barricading the Federal Police 
headquarters in Brasilia. The atmosphere here in the Southern 
Autarky Block, next to the Federal Police headquarters building, 
is getting tense because Federal Police personnel are starting 
to arrive and are finding that about 1,000 military troops have 
been occupying the area since 0100. 
  Until now the only incident that has been reported occurred 
at about 0300, when a car carrying two men tried to break 
through one of the barricades and shooting ensued. 
  Vehicle traffic is under the control of the military police 
and traffic department inspectors. This is also the case near 
the Federal Police Regional Superintendency in the Southern 
Police Sector. Security personnel at the Justice Ministry 
building on the Ministries Esplanade have been reinforced by 
military personnel. 
  Federal Police personnel are now starting to arrive at the 
Southern Autarky Block. They are driving through, looking 
around and going to their respective blocks. 
  German shepherds and soldiers armed with rifles, machine 
guns, and tear gas are strategically located. Those who want to 
enter the Federal Police building to work must identify 
themselves before entering the building which is completely 
surrounded by Army troops.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 11 May (EFE) -- Acting on the orders 
of President Itamar Franco, the Brazilian Army today occupied 
the headquarters of the Federal Police [PF] in Brasilia and Sao 
Paulo, seeking to end the strike the police has been observing 
for the past 51 days. 
  The Brazilian Government yesterday warned the PF that it 
would retaliate against the PF if it continues its strike, which 
was declared illegal because it affects basic services like the 
issuance of passports and drug enforcement. 
  After meeting with the military ministers, President Itamar 
Franco yesterday afternoon ordered the Army to intervene. This 
took place today at dawn when the two main PF buildings in the 
country were taken over. 
  A government spokesman has said the Armed Forces were 
summoned by the president "to guarantee national security."

<F P=106> [Report by Alexandre Garcia, from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco has said that the objective 
of public service is to serve the people -- not to make the 
lives of the Brazilian people even more difficult. The final 
straw was yesterday's takeover of the public building that 
houses the Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia. 
  Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Flores said that the Army 
was summoned because public disorder is unacceptable. The Army 
is using heavy weapons and equipment to discourage any 
resistance from the strikers, who were armed. Resistance might 
have serious consequences. 
  A short time ago, the president of the National Federation 
of 
Federal Policemen said the strikers will return their arms to 
the government to prove the peaceful nature of the strike. 
  The government claims the Army was summoned to guarantee 
constitutional rights and to prevent indiscipline, the taking 
over of public buildings, armed strikes, and to guarantee the 
right to work. 
  President Franco is now meeting with Army Minister Zenildo 
Zoroastro de Lucena and with Flores to evaluate the situation 
and its developments.

  [Text] Brasilia, 11 May (EFE) -- The Brazilian Army today 
deployed several tanks and trucks in the administrative zone of 
Brasilia shortly after taking over the Federal Police [PF] 
headquarters in Brasilia and Sao Paulo, at the request of 
President Itamar Franco, to put an end to a 53-day police strike. 
  According to EFE reporters, after touring the Ministries 
Esplanade area -- where Planalto Palace, congressional 
buildings, and the Supreme Court building are located -- the 
military vehicles were parked in the vicinity of the cathedral. 
  A military deployment like today's has not taken place in 
Brasilia since the time of the military regime (1964-1985), when 
the Army used to deploy its tanks to intimidate government 
opponents. 
  The 7,000 PF personnel have been on strike to demand a 
salary 
increase, but their negotiations with the government have failed. 
  Union leader Jair Meneguelli -- president of the Sole 
Workers 
Center (CUT, leftist), to which the National Federation of 
Police Unions is affiliated -- has demanded that the government 
resume negotiations. 
  Meneguelli declined to comment on persistent rumors 
circulating in Brasilia that Franco, who last night ordered the 
military intervention in police headquarters, is promoting an 
institutional coup similar to the one engineered by Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.

  [Text] High-ranking Army officers who are serving in the 
central barracks of Brasilia have been worrying all day about 
the adverse reaction of troops who refused to obey the orders of 
President Itamar Franco and Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de 
Lucena to intervene in the Federal Police [PF] strike. 
Commenting on the low PF salaries, an Army officer asked: How 
can we intervene in the PF strike if they are demanding the same 
rights that we have for some time been struggling for? 
  PF strike leader Francisco Carlos Garisto, who is an expert 
in drug enforcement and the president of the Federal Policemen 
National Federation, today commented on the Army's intervention 
in the strike. He rejected the possibility of clashes, but 
asserted that the PF will not give a single inch.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by reporter Gianoni Mosquera in Brasilia </F>
-- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Mosquera] Helicopter maneuvers continue here 
over Tres Poderes Square and the Ministries Esplanade. The 
government is displaying its power to deter any possible 
reaction by the Federal Police strikers. Four more helicopters 
are approaching the square; we can hear the noise they are 
making. They were overflying the National Congress esplanade 
and the northern area of the city, and are now heading for the 
Ministries Esplanade. The military sector and the government 
are carrying out these displays. These are Army Puma 
helicopters. 
  [Station announcer] This is not common, is it, Gianoni? 
  [Mosquera] No, normally they are only used in parades and 
military celebrations. Apparently the government is deploying 
all these forces to show that it will not accept any sort of 
challenge from those who are staging the strike. The government 
is determined to have absolute control in case anything happens. 
  As I reported a few minutes ago, troops have been deployed 
here to replace those who had been stationed near Tres Poderes 
Square. 
  [Announcer] Can you see any movement of federal policemen or 
landless farmers, or will demonstrations occur later? 
  [Mosquera] Only a few tourists, and some members of the 
military police, can be seen. Civilian police and Federal 
Police members can no longer be seen. No demonstrators can be 
seen here, near Tres Poderes Square. 
  [Announcer] What are reactions inside Congress? Despite 
having been on the streets, have you had the chance to hear 
comments from the congressmen? 
  [Mosquera] Well, most congressmen are wondering whether the 
government isn't exaggerating in this case. 
  [Announcer] We were listening to an interview inside 
Congress 
when the noise of helicopters could suddenly be heard. It 
attracted the attention of all who were in the building. 
  [Mosquera] Exactly, all the journalists ran outside to see 
what was taking place in the square behind Congress where the 
national flag is located, with Planalto Palace at its left and 
the Federal Supreme Court to the right. 
  [Announcer] Is Ricardo Fiuza's case still being analyzed 
inside Congress? A few minutes ago we could see on the internal 
television circuit that someone was defending Fiuza. 
  [Mosquera] Yes. We are now nearing the Green Hall, and can 
see that Deputy Fiuza is now addressing the plenary session.

<F P=106> [Report by Renata Verissimo in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Army military police troops early this morning 
occupied the Federal Police [PF] superintendency buildings in 
Brasilia and Sao Paulo. Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa 
stated that the action coordinated by the Army is designed to 
stop the abuses being committed during the 52-day strike by PF 
policemen. 
  President Itamar Franco stated that the Army's occupation 
will not end until PF policemen return to work. He said the 
government is only seeking to guarantee basic services, such as 
the issuance of passports and the guarding of airports and 
border areas. 
  Franco said the government will not permit acts of 
disrespect 
against citizens, and emphasized that everything is being done 
in accordance with the Constitution. He said: 
  [Begin Franco recording] I can tell you that this is a 
government that upholds dialogue, a democratic government that 
only called out the Armed Forces to preserve order. It is 
unacceptable for them to have used fireworks and to have 
prevented the PF director from entering the building. Those who 
are willing to strike may do so, but they have to do it in an 
orderly fashion, in accordance with the Constitution and the 
laws. All the executive branch has done is to enforce the 
Constitution and the laws, and it will continue to do so. [end 
recording] 
  Franco made it clear that this is not an act of 
intervention, 
but an action taken by the government to guarantee the people's 
right to travel freely. He does not believe the government will 
lose face as a result of its decision to intervene in the PF. 
He said: 
  [Begin Franco recording] I believe the government will not 
lose face for taking side with the people, whose right to travel 
freely is being curtailed. Thus I believe the government is, in 
this case, defending the people. [end recording] 
  The decision to intervene in the PF was made last night 
during a meeting held by Franco with the military ministers, the 
justice minister, the federal administration minister, and the 
PF director. 
  Costa reported that the operation began in Brasilia at 0140, 
and that President Franco was kept abreast of developments by 
General Fernando Cardoso, chief of the military household.

the press: 
  First, that the president of the Republic is closely 
following all of the actions taken by the Army Ministry aimed at 
preserving public order and the Constitution; 
  Second, that President Franco remains in close contact with 
the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and of the federal 
Senate, who have lent him their full support and solidarity for 
the measures he has taken; 
  Third, that the National Defense Committee of the Chamber of 
Deputies has requested that Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat 
brief its members on the measures taken by the government 
regarding the Federal Police strike. 
  Costa said the president immediately responded to the 
request, and ordered Dupeyrat to appear before the committee to 
answer all of their questions. 
  Dupeyrat is now at Planalto Palace reporting to President 
Franco about his briefing before the National Defense Committee. 
  Finally, Costa reported that President Franco is aware of 
all 
the actions planned to preserve order and the Constitution. 
  Commenting on this afternoon's helicopter airlift of armed 
Army military personnel to Tres Poderes Square, Costa said this 
action was planned during yesterday's meeting between the 
president of the Republic with the military ministers, and that 
this is a combat training exercise by the Army Ministry.

  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro is having dinner with 
the current Bahia governor and with former Governor Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes. Fidel Castro was returning to Cuba after 
attending Nelson Mandela's installation in South Africa, and 
decided to make a stopover in Salvador. 
  Since very early, a strict security regime had been 
organized 
at the Salvador Air Force base to welcome Cuban President Fidel 
Castro. Members of the Air Force and of the Federal Police 
cordoned off the landing strip and allowed only members of the 
welcoming delegation to enter. President Fidel Castro arrived 
at the Air Force base in the middle of the night on board a 
Cuban Airline plane that was returning from South Africa, where 
he attended Nelson Mandela's installation. 
  Fidel Castro was welcomed by Bahia Governor Antonio 
Imbassahy 
and Salvador Mayor Lidice da Matta. 
  It still has not been reported how long President Castro 
will 
stay in Salvador, or his agenda for the visit.

  [Text] Santiago, 11 May (NA) -- Argentine Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo said here that Chile will meet the requirements 
to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South] as of January 1995. 
  Cavallo voiced his desire that Chile join Mercosur, together 
with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as of the first 
day of next year, when the common foreign tariff will be 
established by the member countries. 
  Cavallo believes Chile is "much closer to a trade agreement 
than four years ago," when President Patricio Aylwin's 
government was seriously against an integration process. 
  The Argentine minister made this statement yesterday during 
the seminar "The Southern Cone Dialogue," held in this city and 
attended by ministers and officials of countries of the region. 
  The Argentine official said Chile "can no longer doubt the 
Argentine stabilization process," that turned out to be even 
"more effective" than the one implemented in Chile, which is 
currently governed by Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei. 
  Regarding Brazil, Cavallo mentioned a lack of "political 
decision" to implement reforms like the Argentine convertibility 
plan, because "growth can only be attained with stability." 
  Moreover, he said that Chile must recognize the progress 
made 
by Argentina in the field of the deregulation, infrastructure, 
and free trade rules that were one of the obstacles for a trade 
agreement. 
  "Chile should prefer Mercosur to NAFTA," said Cavallo, 
referring to the Chilean Government's intention to join NAFTA. 
  Today Cavallo is scheduled to visit the Mining Fair where 
more than 1,000 leading companies in the world in the mining 
field will exhibit their goods. 
  He will visit the fair accompanied by Mining Secretary 
Eduardo Maza and Jorge Escobar, the former San Juan governor and 
current national deputy, who accompanied Cavallo to Chile. 
  The governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, 
Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela will exhibit at the 
fair. 
  Cavallo will later meet with Chilean President Eduardo Frei, 
with whom he will discuss joint economic projects. 
  Cavallo and Frei will thoroughly assess the possibility of 
Chile joining Mercosur during the first meeting between the new 
Chilean president and a top ranking Argentine Government 
official.

  [Text] Santiago, 11 May (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo said today that Chile had not received a formal proposal 
to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South], although the need 
to make concrete progress in the creation of a free trade zone 
between the countries was discussed. 
  Cavallo thus minimized the impact of the remarks he made on 
9 
May [as received], in which he emphasized that Chile "has all 
the conditions for joining" Mercosur. 
  Cavallo's proposal thus admits free trade zone negotiations 
by Mercosur, on one hand, and Chile on the other. 
  The finance minister admitted that it would be difficult for 
Chile "to join Mercosur, as it would probably introduce 
uncertainty into the tariff issue, an area in which Chile has 
been very successful with its own policies." 
  Cavallo said that during the meeting with his Chilean 
counterpart Eduardo Aninat he discussed "the real progress in 
trade and in all other kinds of relations between Argentina and 
the other member countries of Mercosur." 
  Cavallo said that free trade negotiations might be the most 
suitable path, but the two countries are also working on others, 
including "our geographical integration through the Andean 
passes, feasibility studies for transport projects, energy 
integration projects, and improvement in our countries' 
investment climates." 
  Regarding the latter, Cavallo said that an agreement might 
be 
reached with the signing of a mutual investment protection 
treaty which would eliminate current obstacles. 
  During a news conference with Chilean journalists, Cavallo 
ardently defended the scheme of a fixed foreign exchange rate, a 
mechanism that was dropped by Chile because of the poor results 
obtained. 
  He stressed that "Argentina does not have a single currency 
requirement" but a free choice system, adding that this assures 
us that governments "will not devaluate" the peso. 
  Cavallo also reiterated that in 1994 the country will have 
an 
inflation rate of "3 percent or less," and forecast that 
Argentina will close the year with a significant economic growth 
rate. 
  Asked whether some social groups are paying the price for 
the 
adjustment, Cavallo said that social explosions such as the one 
in Santiago de Estero were made "against corruption and bad 
provincial administrations, and not against the convertibility 
plan." 
  "People have not reacted against the economic plan because 
they realize the benefits of stability and growth," the minister 
added. 
  Cavallo said that the proof that Argentina offers favorable 
conditions is the fact that "more than 200,000 foreigners" had 
emigrated to the country in the past few years. 
  The minister added that public support was evident in the 
1991, 1993, and 10 April 1994 elections. 
  Cavallo concluded by saying that the Justicialist Party will 
again win the presidential election in 1995.

  [Editorial Report] A weekly column in the Buenos Aires 
daily LA NACION has repeatedly called attention to the 
competitiveness crisis in Argentine agriculture. According to an 
editorial in the 26 March edition of the same daily, "history 
clearly shows" that the "belligerence of [those engaged in] 
agriculture does nothing to promote sociopolitical stability or 
harmony," reminding the government at all levels that "it still 
has the time and tools available to respond" to the crisis. 
  "The increasingly surly statements" by organizations 
representing Argentine agriculture and the "emergence of new 
movements with even more vehement protests" are a "clear sign" 
that many in the farming industry think that the difficulties 
they are suffering are "neither fully understood nor addressed 
by current economic policy," continued the LA NACION editorial. 
  "It was obvious from the beginning," explained the 
editorial, 
"that the rules of the game on which the stabilization of the 
currency is based" would call for a restructuring of the 
agriculture industry, and that this restructuring would demand, 
"at the very least," adequate financing and tax relief, halting 
the erosion in the productive capacity of the industry, two 
requirements, which were "never met." 
  Designed to better represent smaller producers represented 
neither provincially nor nationally, the newly created Buenos 
Aires Agriculture Front (FAB), according to the editorial, has 
vowed to "denounce the restructuring proposed by the 
government," saying it is "valid only for powerful industries." 
  Argentine Rural Society (SRA) First Vice President Enrique 
Crotto is not afraid of foreign competition, reported the 12 
March Buenos Aires daily LA PRENSA, "even from countries that 
subsidize" their products, as long as Argentine producers have 
access to the same "tools" as their competition, such as a 
long-range agriculture policy, comparable tax burdens, and 
internationally competitive credit, "none of which is within our 
reach." According to Crotto, the proposed wealth tax is 
equivalent to the former assets tax under another name and, 
although the government-backed Rural Mortgage Securities (CHR) 
sounded good when they were announced, no one seems to be able 
to explain why so few loans have been granted, in spite of all 
the promises. 
  Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA) head Manuel Cabanellas 
has complained about the lack of regularly scheduled meetings of 
the National Agriculture Council (CNA), presided over by 
Secretary of Agriculture Felipe Sola, reported the 12 March LA 
NACION. The industry's four main organizations--SRA, CRA, 
Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA), and the 
Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative Confederation 
(Coninagro)--with representatives on the council, "consider it 
to be the natural forum" to address problems that plague the 
industry, such as indebtedness, high production costs, low 
international prices, the VAT (value-added tax), and the 
proposed wealth tax. 
  According to the same 12 March edition of LA NACION, a 
recent 
report put out by Coninagro, entitled "The Cost of Stability," 
contended that the agriculture industry is making "extreme 
sacrifices" in the name of stability, while others, such as the 
automobile industry, enjoy trade protection. 
  LA NACION of 5 March pointed to the decline in economic 
activity in the regional economies, which to a great extent 
revolve around agriculture. For that reason, continues the 
daily, it is no wonder the Confederation of Buenos Aires and the 
Pampa Rural Associations (Carbap), a grouping of 107 farming 
societies from the two provinces with approximately 34,000 
members, has warned that it will "take to the streets," if 
necessary, to achieve the solutions the industry requires. The 
19 March LA NACI0N added that the agriculture industry is 
"dusting off" threats of future protests. FAA President Humberto 
Volando at the Chacra Expo said that both the leadership and the 
producers in Coninagro, Carbap, and the FAA were talking about 
organizing a "large national protest" before the end of the year. 
  "We're beginning to get mad," declared Eduardo de Zavalia, 
head of the Argentine Rural Society (SRA). On 31 May 1993, the 
SRA presented the government with a "Plan of Assistance for 
Restructuring the Argentine Agriculture Industry," reports the 
26 March LA NACION. The SRA document warned about the crisis in 
the industry and proposed specific measures to stimulate credit, 
financing, production, and trade expansion, which the 
organization felt would facilitate restructuring. Recently, 
however, the SRA has "toughened" its stance, heretofore more 
supportive of government economic policy. The organization 
released a public statement criticizing the government for its 
"incomplete, late, and clearly inadequate" responses, reflecting 
a "lack of understanding" of the "seriousness" and "urgency" 
with which the industry's problems must be addressed (LA PRENSA, 
23 March). The document also pointed to the "absence of valid 
alternatives," leaving farmers and ranchers increasingly 
"discouraged and angry, their just demands ignored, while 
special programs for other industries are implemented."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 11 May (DPA) -- The government 
today lifted the state of internal disturbance it decreed on 1 
May to prevent the release from prison of some 840 inmates 
charged with drug trafficking, subversion, and kidnapping. The 
state of internal disturbance was decreed at that time because 
the arraignment deadline for suspected criminals was about to 
expire. 
  Different political sectors welcomed the exceptional 
measure, 
which was expected to last only 10 days, although they asked for 
reforms in the judicial codes so the government would not have 
to resort to this mechanism to prevent the release of accused 
criminals. 
  Although it lifted the state of internal disturbance, the 
government extended for another 90 days the judicial emergency 
decreed under the exceptional measure for the purpose of 
extending the deadline to allow prosecutors to gather evidence 
against the defendants or to arraign them. 
  The lawyers for the 840 defendants affected by the measure 
criticized the government, noting that if the Prosecutor 
General's Office was unable to prove the guilt of their clients 
in the time allotted, their continued detention was a "violation 
of their human rights." 
  The extension of the processing deadline only affects those 
charged with terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping -- 
offenses that fall within the jurisdiction of "faceless" judges. 
The proceedings for individuals charged with other kinds of 
offenses are continuing along their normal course. 
  The state of internal disturbance is included in the 1991 
Constitution, and, so far, it has been enforced three times -- 
twice to prevent massive prison releases and once to cope with a 
violent terrorist offensive by communist guerrilla groups and 
drug trafficking mafias.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government decided to lift the state 
of internal disturbance decreed on 1 May. However, in order to 
prevent the release of an overwhelming number of inmates, the 
government also decided to extend the judicial emergency decree. 
The decree, which was signed by the president and all his 
cabinet ministers, stipulates that the emergency will be 
extended for an additional 90 days. 
  The government justifies the measure by indicating that the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the courts will now have 
sufficient time and resources to complete investigations still 
under way as well as to render a decision. 
  As of today, all circuit judges will be allowed to become 
involved in cases which up until now were restricted only to 
special judges. Ten days ago, 42 regional judges were 
responsible for handling 4,500 cases dealing with drug 
trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. This backlog prevented 
them from completing the cases within the period stipulated by 
law, the reason for which the judicial emergency was declared.

  [Text] Quito, 9 May (AFP) -- General Victor Manuel Vayas 
was sworn in on Monday as new commander general of the Ecuadoran 
Army during a simple ceremony at the Presidential Palace and 
presided over by President Sixto Duran-Ballen. The ceremony was 
attended by the Military High Command and members of the 
cabinet. The outgoing commander general, Gen. Edmundo Luna, 
traveled to the United States last week where he is undergoing a 
medical checkup. The special military ceremony, with military 
honors and the usual speeches, is scheduled for Thursday. 
  Defense Minister Gen. Jose Gallardo said the appointment of 
a 
new commander will result in the normal changes of Army officers 
and reiterated that this will not represent a problem. The 
defense minister added that Gen. Luna was replaced because he 
had completed his time in the Army ranks. Vayas reiterated that 
there are no problems. He said all is well and that he wants to 
carry out his duties as established in the Constitution.

  [Excerpt] Analysts in the Peruvian security forces have 
concluded that the new Shining Path Central Committee, which is 
headed by dissident Alberto Ramirez Duran, also known as 
"Feliciano," has decided to reorganize the party to resume the 
so-called "people's war." 
  The key steps toward this objectives are: a) resume "work 
with the masses" (especially in poor Lima neighborhoods); b) 
step up military actions; c) strengthen compartmentalization 
(cell organization) at all levels; and d) enhance underground 
security. The main objective is to move ahead with the 
so-called Sixth Grand Plan, whose implementation stopped 
suddenly in September 1992 when Abimael Guzman was captured. 
  In simple words, "Feliciano's" Shining Path faction intends 
to continue terrorist operations, openly disregarding Guzman's 
instructions to his followers, who have paid no attention so 
far, to cease violent actions in the quest for a peace agreement 
with the government. 
  Above and beyond the feverish fantasies of Shining Path's 
current leadership, the organization no longer poses an imminent 
threat for the Peruvian state. The analysts believe that 
Shining Path's decay is irreversible, although it is not going 
to be a short-term process. The experts indicated that the final 
battle against the terrorist organization is nowhere in sight 
yet, and it would be imprudent to lower the guard. 
  According to information this newspaper and Dincote 
[National 
Counterterrorism Directorate] gathered in Lima suburbs, for some 
time now the Shining Path has been infiltrating many 
shantytowns, settlements, cooperative urban developments, and 
the multitudinous Lima marketplaces. This infiltration is 
simply part of the "work with the masses" aimed at rebuilding 
cadres. 
  The murder of neighborhood leader and street vendor Benito 
Escalante Apaza on 29 April, near La Parada in the La Victoria 
district, was followed by the murder of national boxing champion 
Carlos Lavalle, a much-liked former leader of the Felix Raucarte 
Housing Cooperative in Ate-Vitarte. Dincote found out that 
Lavalle was killed by an Shining Path annihilation squad, and 
that Escalante Apaza used to be a leader of the Manuel Scorza 
settlement in San Juan de Lurigancho. 
  Dincote also found out that Shining Path militants killed 
two 
residents of the Santa Eulalia district (Huarochiri Province), 
near Chosica, early on 28 April. The victims were accused of 
stealing cattle. The police explained that terrorists seek to 
win the residents' trust and support by punishing criminals.

  [Text] Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, who for some time now 
has been known as "President Feliciano" by those who currently 
reject Abimael Guzman Reynoso's leadership, has reportedly 
simultaneously ordered an increase in Shining Path actions in 
Lima and the transfer of Shining Path bases and refuge areas to 
border regions, so as to expedite the Shining Path's escape 
abroad in case of possible defeat. 
  This is according to an intelligence report based on 
statements made by Shining Path members who have resorted to the 
repentance law and who have been in contact with Ramirez 
Durand's lieutenants. 
  There are indications that a few months ago, "Feliciano" 
tried to meet with terrorist cadres operating as "roving" 
columns in Azangaro and Melgar, in Puno. There is also, however, 
testimony that Ramirez Durand is currently in the Gran Pajonal 
jungle area in Pasco. Another theory states that he is in Lima, 
personally heading the so-called "Neighborhood Class Movement" 
in Lima shantytowns. 
  The fact is that a so-called "Emergency Central Committee" 
has started to operate in Lima. This committee seeks to 
coordinate actions in seven areas in the outskirts of Lima, in 
the same places where the establishment of an "iron belt" was 
attempted, before Abimael Guzman's fall, to strangle and take 
over the city. 
  Ramirez Durand reportedly has a contingent of about 200 
Shining Path members called the "People's Guerrilla Army." They 
are armed and the majority of them have been selected for their 
"loyalty" and for having shown cruelty and the capacity to 
strictly follow "orders." They are like robots, willing to 
sacrifice themselves for "Feliciano," who holds complete control 
over them. Only a few of them personally know him, however. 
  Intelligence souces report that "what they ignore is that 
Ramirez Durand will employ the `sausage' policy against them: 
When he sees he has lost, he will leave them behind as cannon 
fodder to cover his withdrawal. They will be grouped in 
platoons to divert attention or to halt the Army's advance so 
that "Feliciano" can escape to the "refuge" areas.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, a Huallaga Front patrol captured a 
Shining Path leader. He is providing valuable information about 
the whereabouts of the "Red Sea" terrorist battalion. This 
group was located in the Yanajanca valley and surrounding areas. 
The arrested terrorist is also giving information on the 
location of a hideout used by high-ranking Shining Path 
political and logistic commanders. 
  The wounded terrorist was identified as Ely Puertas 
Dominguez, alias comrade "John." Yesterday, his right arm was 
operated on for the third time. He is recovering well at the 
intensive care unit of the Tingo Maria hospital. 
  Puertas told EXPRESO that the "Red Sea" battalion has nearly 
300 members, most of whom are civilians recruited by force. 
Each column is made up of 50 individuals. "There were 25 
individuals in my column, but our ranks increased to 45 after we 
recruited inhabitants from a local settlement with death

force." 
  Puertas revealed that there is a group of hired killers in 
the "Red Sea" battalion and that they are responsible for 
murdering the families of members who run away. The arrested 
terrorist said Shining Path members are hungry and thirsty 
because they do not have food. 
  Puertas said: "The fighters eat only yucca and bananas. Many 
of them are weak, sick with tuberculosis. They want to leave 
but are unable to do so because their lives and the lives of 
their families are at risk," [passage omitted]

  [Text] There was student violence in Caracas for a fourth 
consecutive day. The disturbances began early Tuesday morning at 
Moran Avenue when students from the Jose de San Martin 
Vocational School began protesting the death last Thursday of 
German Sotillo, from the Fermin Toro School. The students also 
protested over the announced hike in student transportation 
rates which might begin within the next few days, according to 
Juan Landaeta, a student from the Jose de San Martin Vocational 
School. [passage indistinct] 
  The students detained a grocery truck, with license plate 
number 624XCO, from the Diaz Supermarkets. After residents of 
the area looted the truck, the students burned it. Five public 
transportation buses were also detained for over three hours at 
the Jose de San Martin School. 
  After several hours of clashes, the students tried to call 
for a truce in exchange for the release of some of their fellow 
students who had been arrested, but this did not occur. 
  Students from the Andres Bello, Santos, Michelena, and 
Rafael 
Urdaneta Schools later joined the protests at Mexico Avenue, in 
front of the Andres Bello School. One store was looted during 
this demonstration. The Metropolitan Police are conducting 
investigations.

  [Text] Caracas, 11 May (DPA) -- Student protests continued 
today in several Caracas neighborhoods and nearby areas. The 
protests initially resulted in the arrest of 65 demonstrators 
and the looting and burning of a cargo truck, according to radio 
reports. 
  Today's demonstrations, staged by high school students, took 
place in the neighborhoods of Propatria, Caricuao, and Moran, in 
the southern and southeastern areas of Caracas. Meanwhile, other 
demonstrations were reported in the towns of Los Teques and 
Valles del Tuy, near the Venezuelan capital. 
  According to Radio Rumbos, 15 demonstrators were arrested in 
Caracas and 50 in Valles del Tuy, where a soda truck was looted 
and burned. 
  The protesters are demanding preferential student bus fares, 
which in practice means having to pay half of the regular public 
transportation fares. 
  There were protests in Caracas yesterday, in which two 
policemen were injured by stones and bottles hurled by students. 
Today, in addition to policemen, members of the militarized 
National Guard intervened in an attempt to stop the 
demonstrations.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Yolanda Garces from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The indefinite strike by court employees that began 
Monday will not end until the representatives of the Judiciary 
Council, labor groups, and the executive agree on a solution 
that meets workers' demands. For more than one year now, these 
employees have been awaiting the implementation of an 
arbitration ruling signed as the result of a situation similar 
to the one the judicial branch is now experiencing. According to 
Judiciary Council President (Beli Estaba), the executive was 
asked on Tuesday to review the situation and to approve the 
necessary credit immediately to comply with the ruling which has 
not yet been put into force because of a lack of funds. 
  [Begin recording] [Estaba] We cannot blame this situation on 
this or that person. What we must do is resolve the problem. On 
2 February, we requested the additional credit to comply with 
the terms of the arbitration ruling issued by the Velasquez 
administration. We have proof that Ocepre [Central Budget 
Office] received the request on 3 February at 0213. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What happened? Have you received any 
information from the executive? 
  [Estaba] We have not, although we have met with the minister 
of the Secretariat of the Presidency and the deputy minister of 
finance. We have not heard anything about this credit. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] say the Judiciary Council 
magistrates have blocked granting other socioeconomic benefits 
that were included in last year's arbitration ruling? 
  [Estaba] That is not true. We have complied with the ruling 
to the extent that our resources permit. [end recording] 
  The representative of the court employees said the strike 
will stop only if their demands are accepted, including the 
exact date in which they will be paid the social benefits they 
have not yet received. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified labor leader] The strike 
will end when the minimal conditions are met, as we just 
informed the Judiciary Council during the plenary meeting. Those 
conditions include: the immediate approval of the salary we are 
requesting, based on the proper implementation of the 
arbitration ruling; the exact date we will be paid; a general 
revision of the budget to request additional credit in line with 
the true needs of the arbitration ruling; approval of the income 
and overtime regulations; approval of the labor law privileges, 
which they are ignoring; reinstatement of dismissed employees; 
and acknowledgement of our rights to concessions. Clearly, these 
are minimal conditions, and had such rights not existed, we 
would not have had an arbitration ruling in our favor. We are 
prepared to negotiate the other points of disagreement--points 
which do exist--without a strike. [end recording] 
  Court activities are paralyzed nationwide. Only a few penal 
courts are working in Caracas, such as the 26th Penal Court. 
Although it has not held hearings or conducted secretarial work, 
this court took the statements of those people indicted in the 
case of financial assistance funds, including (Jose Luis 
Rovenga) and (Luis Guanone), FIDEC [expansion unknown] president 
and board member, respectively.

newscast] 
  [Text] Since early this morning, Tuesday [10 May -- as 
heard], a large group of state white and blue collar workers 
have been demonstrating outside Congress to express their 
demands. There were some tense moments in Congress when the 
demonstrators threatened to enter the Congress by force if 
congressional authorities did not present themselves. The 
situation, however, was solved when Congress President Senator 
Eduardo Gomez Tamayo heard their demands and received the 
document with their list of petitions. CTV [Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers] leader, Rito Alvarez explained their demands. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] We are [words indistinct] the 
national Congress leaders to expedite the payment of wage 
increases contained in the decree former president Ramon J. 
Velasquez signed. Second, employees of entities being 
restructured, privatized, or liquidated should not be excluded, 
because we believe the decree (?includes them) [words 
indistinct], and it is not the public employees's fault that 
enterprises are being privatized, reorganized, or liquidated. 
  We are also demanding the [words indistinct] of salaries for 
pensioners and retirees who are living in poverty. It is 
disgraceful that people who have worked all their lives should 
face such extreme poverty after they are no longer productive. 
[end recording] 
  Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo said lawmakers will 
review the document with great care. He admitted the country's 
situation has become somewhat difficult and he made an appeal to 
the people. 
  [Begin Gomez recording] [Words indistinct] you, the 
country's 
situation has become difficult, and this is unfortunate. I 
believe now is the time to show we are patriots, Venezuelans, 
above all else. The situation requires a great effort, sacrifice 
from all sectors, without exception, to have a successful 
resolution. This is what we need to do, and I believe...[pauses] 
and take advantage of this opportunity to call on different 
segments of society to think of Venezuela first before adopting 
any stance or attitude. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From "The National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Venezuelan Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has 
charged there is a subversive plan aimed at destabilizing the 
country. Escovar also said that the national government will 
adopt severe measures against persons speculating in the value 
of the dollar. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] I want to tell you the following: 
This morning there were riots in some areas of the capital and 
in some places in the interior. Most of the demonstrations are 
under control. None are out of the government's control. Both 
the National Guard and the metropolitan police are on the 
streets closely cooperating to safeguard public order. 
  The citizens can be sure that the government is prepared to 
take every measure necessary to safeguard the country's peace. I 
want to report that there is a plan that calls for agitation. 
Political interests that sometimes are contradictory are 
involved in this plan. The people involved hope that public 
order alterations may help their particular objectives. 
  To this we can add that before I was interior minister, when 
I was the prosecutor general, I spoke of a hairy arm. I want to 
tell you that the hairy arm is roaming around, that it is acting 
up. The government is investigating to determine the degree of 
participation in these events of the mourners of corruption and 
people who do not want the penalization of some crimes against 
the state or of crimes of corruption, people who want to create 
confusion to use it as a smokescreen at a moment when the 
country is closely following the struggle against corruption. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Education Minister Antonio Luis Cardenas appealed 
to students not to be fooled. He also urged parents and others 
not to let secondary schools be used for subversive purposes. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] Right. We, and I in particular, 
as 
education minister, deeply regret that people who want to 
subvert public order, as well as destabilize the country, are 
using public secondary schools and the boys, girls, and young 
people studying in those schools to create riots and confusion. 
  Those people must realize that those schools care for the 
lower income population and that the country is being seriously 
harmed when boys and girls and young people are used to achieve 
ugly goals. We have already had the unfortunate death of one 
student. We regret that. Today I was informed that a young man 
and a boy have been wounded. We must stop this situation. We 
must clearly identify who the enemies of public education are, 
who is leading these young people to a dangerous situation. We 
appeal to parents and custodians and the community not to let 
their schools, the ones attended by the needy people, the public 
schools, to be used for subversive purposes. 
  We have decided not to suspend classes because we do not 
think that is a solution, that it would harm the young people.

<F P=106> [Report by Geovani Esposito from Maracaibo] </F>
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has acknowledged that 
Venezuela's economy is in serious disarray. Nevertheless, he was 
also optimistic enough to say that his administration is doing 
its utmost to overcome the situation. 
  Following constant subsidies totalling nearly 120 billion 
bolivares authorized since this past January, Fogade [Deposit 
Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] is now the owner of 
approximately 72 percent of Banco de Maracaibo shares. 
  Fogade President Norys Aguirre announced the names of the 
new 
Banco de Maracaibo Board of Directors, which will be headed by 
Jorge Correa. The new board of directors will be responsible for 
executing and implementing the reorganization plan that 
includes, among others, the following measures: streamlining 
spending, restoring Bank of Maracaibo's losses with Fogade 
financial assets, increasing the bank's capital to more or less 
6 percent of assets, reorganizing operations by injecting 
resources, implementing auditing practices, and requesting 
technical assistance from international experts specializing in 
the subject. 
  The Fogade president also indicated that by intervening in 
the Occidente Mortgage Bank, the Banking Superintendency was 
able to stabilize the bank's situation as part of Latino Group. 
  Aguirre pointed out that she supports the reorganization 
plan 
about to be implemented by intervention board President Enrique 
Faria de Lima. He has set 17 May as the date for offering 
guarantees to depositors. 
  According to the Fogade president, all of these traumas 
which 
the Venezuelan financial system is enduring represent one of its 
worst crises. Nevetheless, she believes that one should not fall 
victim to the mistake twice. 
  [Begin Aguirre recording, in progress]...an improved 
supervisory organization. A renovated oversight organization 
that will not allow situations to develop to a level such as 
that at which we have arrived today in Venezuela. [end

  [Text] It has been officially announced in Pretoria that 
South African President Nelson Mandela made one of his first 
foreign policy decisions today, establishing diplomatic 
relations with Cuba. 
  Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina 
and 
Alfred Nzo formalized a protocol that establishes a new stage in 
relations between Pretoria and Havana today. The two governments 
had no diplomatic relations to date because of our government 
and people's rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of 
apartheid. 
  Less than 48 hours after becoming president, Nelson Mandela, 
leader of the African National Congress [ANC], raised the 
relations of friendship and solidarity that have existed for 
years between Cuba and the formerly proscribed ANC to the 
government level. 
  During his visit to Pretoria, Castro said there have been 
moments of strong confrontations in past bilateral relations 
between Cuba and South Africa. Castro recalled Cuba's 
internationalist position against the policy of apartheid 
against the majority black populations of South Africa, Namibia, 
and Angola -- a policy now overcome -- adding that there is now 
a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection 
toward Cuba. 
  Today, Fidel Castro, heading the Cuban delegation, will 
conclude his first official and friendly visit to South Africa, 
a visit that began on 9 May to attend the inauguration of Nelson 
Mandela, the first black president of a country that has left 
behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination now. 
  At the signing of the new document regarding diplomatic 
relations, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was accompanied by 
Angel Dalmau, Cuban ambassador to Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, 
minister of Science, Technology, and Environment; and (Marcos 
Rodriguez), who will represent our country in Pretoria 
temporarily.

something that attracted much attention. He said that he would 
Mexicanize education. This happened a few minutes ago in the

Pescador Osuna, and highlighted the work of Fernando Solana

Solana has filled ranging from National Company for Basic 
Commodities to several state secretariats. In a few more

party in accordance with the new electoral laws. To avoid 
committing any electoral crime, I will simply say thank you

  [Text] The Nicaraguan Government has denied that the United

Structural Adjustment Facility] remittances will be affected as 
a result of a [U.S.] law amendment, not yet approved by 
Congress, aimed at countries that have confiscated property from

that "if the law is applied the way I think it will be, the 
effects on the national economy will be devastating." 
  The amendment, which still does not have the force of law, 
reads that all bilateral aid to the government will be suspended 
if 90 days after the law is enacted the expropriation claims 
made by U.S. citizens have not been resolved. The amendment 
also establishes ways to avoid economic sanctions: return the 
claimed properties; provide adequate and effective compensation 
for such a property in foreign currency or another mutually 
acceptable way; apply quick, adequate, and effective domestic 
compensation in accordance with international law; or, submit 
the dispute to arbitration in accordance with international law. 
  Yesterday, Engineer Ramiro Gurdian said in a television 
program that Senator Jesse Helms had managed to get bilateral 
and multilateral aid to Nicaragua frozen if Nicaragua does not 
resolve within 90 days -- which expires in June -- the cases of 
125 U.S. citizens who have made claims on 258 properties. 
  According to Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, Helms has tried 
to get the amendment approved without taking into account that 
the Confiscation Quantification Office (OCI) has been operating 
for nearly two years. 
  "I do not accept pressure from anyone," Chamorro said upon 
her return from Costa Rica. "Of course, there are homes still 
to be returned, and I call on those who have them to return 
them," she added. 
<H5>  It Will Affect Remittances </H5>
  A diplomatic source in Washington told BARRICADA that if 
this 
law comes into effect, "apparently it will affect the 
remittances that are about to be released covering 1994 and 
future ones in 1995." 
  Deputy Danilo Aguirre said that the seriousness of this 
affair will in part be conditioned by the internal capacity the 
government shows to resolve the property issue. According to 
him, the Sandinist Front must propose to the Sandinist wing in 
the National Assembly an overall solution to these claims. 
  Minister Leal said that the Helms amendment "is not 
applicable in the case of Nicaragua," because the Chamorro 
government is implementing a mechanism provided for in this U.S. 
law initiative. Helms insists Nicaragua has not shown any 
progress and cited as an example some 28 state properties that 
have not been returned to U.S. citizens. The foreign minister 
said that these are 22 properties, and he said that these will 
be dealt with as soon as possible by the OCI, created to deal 
with 5,200 expropriation claims. 
<H5>  The U.S. Wants To See Steps </H5>
  According to Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, this total had 
a variable number of U.S. citizens between 112 and 120. He 
described the figure, which at one point surpassed 400, as "a 
moving target," because it included Nicaraguan citizens who 
became naturalized U.S. citizens after their property was 
confiscated. According to Minister Leal these new U.S. citizens 
count as Nicaraguans because this is what international law 
says. Furthermore "their properties were properly confiscated 
according to Decrees No. 3 and 38 and they will not be 
indemnified," Pereira said. 
  The diplomatic source in Washington said that "what is most 
important for the majority in Congress is that the Nicaraguan 
Government take steps toward solving the cases of properties 
claimed by U.S. citizens." 
  Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs, spoke in similar terms during his visit 
to Nicaragua: "We hope Nicaragua continues to show progress, 
resolving every possible case, in the least amount of time." 
  U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua John Maisto has accepted that 
the Chamorro government has made progress in the matter, but 
also insisted that Chamorro must "continue to show progress." 
  The source stressed that the U.S. Congress would like to see 
solutions "especially dealing with properties still in the hands 
of the state and occupied by government officials or by the 
state itself." 
  Regarding the possibility that the amendment to the Economic 
Power Act of 1956 be approved by the U.S. Congress, the source 
was of the opinion that "for most in Washington, Helms' 
standards are not reasonable. The overriding spirit here is 
that there has been progress (in Nicaragua)." 
  Nicaragua, according to Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, "is 
the only country in the world with problems of such magnitude 
with the United States."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential candidate Ernesto </F>
Perez Balladares in Panama City by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the 
"24 Hours" newscast on 10 May -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Presidential elections were held last 
Sunday in the Republic of Panama. The winner of the elections 
was Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who is in Panama City. Good 
evening, Dr. Perez Balladares. 
  [Perez] Good evening. 
  [Zabludovsky] How do you feel after the elections? 
  [Perez] Obviously, I am quite satisfied. I think this has 
been an extraordinary civic process by the Panamanian people. I 
greatly appreciate the massive support received through votes. 
Also, I am greatly appreciative of my adversaries, because we 
managed to conduct an extraordinary campaign with a high level 
of civic-mindedness and specific proposals. I am very proud -- 
truly very proud -- of the Panamanians and of the level of 
culture and political development we have demonstrated in this 
campaign of 1994. 
  [Zabludovsky] Everyone is asking the question: Who is Dr. 
Perez Balladares? 
  [Perez] I am an economist. I graduated in 1967, obtained a 
masters degree in economics in 1969, and a masters degree in 
finance in 1970. After that I was a banker for five years. I 
then joined the government of Omar Torrijos, where I served from 
1976 until one year after his death until 1983 -- excuse me, 
1982. I was finance and treasury minister. I was planning and 
economic policy minister. Since then I have been an active 
member of the Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
  [Zabludovsky] One of the topics that was raised by your 
enemies during the campaign was that there could be a rebirth of 
militarism with your victory in Panama. 
  [Perez] I think that, more than anything, that was an 
electoral attack, which has now ended. Many knew that was 
obviously false. First, all military regimes have been 
dismantled throughout not only the American continent, but also 
in Asia, Africa, everywhere. The justification that was used 
for its existence, the alleged retaining wall to curb the 
progress of what the United States identified as its enemies -- 
international communism -- has vanished. Now democracy is in 
vogue, and this is something we applaud. 
  The same thing is happening in Panama. Because of 
international geopolitical conditions, and because of domestic 
conditions, there cannot be a return to militarism. This is so 
true that today I dare say the next foreign minister of my 
government will be Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a man who, from the 
United States, strongly opposed the former military regime. 
Therefore, there can hardly be any threat of a return to the 
past. 
  [Zabludovsky] What type of government will you try to 
promote 
in your first 100 days? 
  [Perez] We have based all of our government proposals, our 
entire campaign, and all of our efforts on achieving the 
reconciliation of Panamanian society. This society was deeply 
divided during the final years of the military government and by 
the invasion. We have to achieve this, and we must take 
specific steps. This cannot remain a mere electoral pledge or an 
expression of goodwill. I have to dedicate myself to building 
on this pledge in the first 100 days, striving to achieve a 
government of national consensus and unity, to enable Panama to 
enter the 21st century as a united country and as a country of 
equal opportunity. Obviously, I must work to ensure this at a 
later date, but the first thing is to make sure that everyone 
perceives us as a government of unity, as a government disposed 
to making the best efforts with the best men and women available 
in order that this can be our goal within the next five years. 
  [Zabludovsky] For nearly 100 years, one of the most 
controversial topics in Panama has been the U.S. military 
presence there. A poll was conducted and many people believe 
the U.S. military should remain. What is your view on this? 
  [Perez] Let me clear up something first. What we have are 
polls, and it has been proven that polls in Panama somehow are 
not totally reliable, as was shown in the recent elections. 
What does exist is a statement by many who have been polled in 
the sense that there is a feeling of apprehension, of fear 
perhaps, regarding the possible departure of the U.S. military 
from Panama. 
  We cannot give into this fear, which in the majority of 
cases 
is unfounded, because we Panamanians have not only the 
capability but also the willingness to oversee the 
administration of the Panama Canal. Most of these fears respond 
to things that the people themselves do not understand, perhaps 
because of a certain degree on evil within some people who have 
instilled this in the people's minds. For example, some say 
that if the North Americans leave, the U.S. dollar will leave. 
These are two completely different things, and yet, the man on 
the street does not understand that the U.S. dollar is 
circulating on the street, not because of the U.S. presence 
here, but because it is our sovereign decision to have this 
currency circulating in Panama, which we Panamanians earn with 
our sale of services and goods abroad. 
  The presence of U.S. military bases in Panama is defined in 
the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. They clearly state that by 31 
December 1999, there should not be one single U.S. soldier in 
Panama. The presence of bases in any part of the world by any 
foreign power cannot be justified by economic issues. Military 
bases exist in any part of the world when there is a military 
interest in protection or aggression [as heard]. I do not think 
this is the case in Panama. The historic justification for the 
existence or presence of military bases in Panama, which was to 
defend the interoceanic waterway when the U.S. strategic weapon 
was the Navy, has disappeared. Nor is the Panama Canal 
threatened. In turn, we Panamanians do not see any reason from 
a military standpoint for there to be bases in Panama, at least 
not with the justifications used in the past. 
  If there is any other reason for a small or medium-sized 
U.S. 
military presence in Panama, the United States would have to say 
what it is and propose it to the Panamanians. Then we would 
have to look at our national interests, strictly from a security 
and military viewpoint. The positive or negative consequences 
of the permanence of U.S. troops in Panama because of economic 
issues is not a basis for such a decision. That is something 
altogether different, and it cannot be the fundamental criterion 
for agreeing to or opposing a U.S. military presence in Panama. 
  Let us suppose there is an additional interest on the part 
of 
the United States to maintain some presence in Panama. I can 
think, for example, of let us say the struggle against drug 
trafficking. If there is an interest on the part of the United 
States in this, then we would have to see what the terms and 
conditions are. Anything that might be agreed upon would then 
have to be submitted to a national referendum, because that is 
not a decision that can be made exclusively by the executive or 
legislative branch. It would have to be subjected to a 
referendum by the Panamanian people.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Walter Lima from the Federal Police </F>
headquarters in Brasilia -- live] 
  [Text] Today at dawn, the Army surrounded the Federal 
Police [PF] headquarters in Brasilia. The Army surrounded the 
perimeter of the Federal Police installations at about 0100 
today. The Army surrounded the PF headquarters in the Southern 
Autarky [State autonomous organizations] block of Brasilia, the 
PF regional office at the southern police block, and the PF 
office at the Justice Ministry, strategically stationing men 
armed with rifles and submachine guns and accompanied by German 
shepherds. 
  The area here in the Southern Autarky sector is isolated. 
Both drivers and pedestrians must identify themselves if they 
want to go through any of the isolation cordons. Traffic has 
been diverted from the area. 
  The situation here is so far apparently calm. There is great 
expectation over the arrival of the PF members on strike. There 
are nearly 1,000 soldiers stationed here in the PF headquarters. 
A short while ago reinforcements arrived in two trucks and a 
jeep. 
  We will have more information from the Southern Autarky 
block 
where Army troops surrounded the perimeter of the PF 
headquarters in Brasilia.

  [Text] According to the last poll by IBOPE [Brazilian 
Public Opinion and Statistics Institute], PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] presidential candidate Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso has lost his second place to PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] Senator for Amapa Jose Sarney. The poll, the 
results of which were released yesterday, shows that PT [Workers 
Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's popularity has 
grown in all simulated elections, and he firmly holds the 
leading position. 
  Cardoso's popularity has dropped in three simulated 
elections: one in which the PMDB candidate is Jose Sarney; 
another in which the PMDB candidate is former Sao Paulo Governor 
Orestes Quercia; and a third in which former Parana Governor 
Roberto Requiao is a contender. The percentage of undecided has 
remained stable at around 30 percent. 
  In the simulated election in which Sarney is the PMDB 
candidate, Cardoso's popularity dropped from 16 percent in the 
last IBOPE poll to 13 percent, while Sarney scored 15 percent. 
With Quercia, Cardoso remained second, but with a lower 
percentage. While in the last IBOPE poll released on 17 April 
he had 17 percent, he now scored 15 percent. With Requiao, 
Cardoso's popularity drop has been smaller: He dropped from 17 
to 16 percent. In the simulated election with the participation 
of Quercia, Lula rose from 33 percent previously to 36 percent; 
with Sarney from 30 to 32 percent; and with Requiao from 34 to 
36 percent. 
<H5>  Brizola </H5>
  Quercia's popularity, which stood at 5 percent, is, like 
that 
of Requiao, 4 percent, meaningless. Former Rio de Janeiro 
Governor Leonel Brizola's candidacy remained at 8 percent when 
confronted with Sarney and Quercia, and at 9 percent with 
Requiao. Lula continues to beat all contenders in simulated 
runoff elections. With Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he won by 48 
to 29 percent, and with Sarney by 44 to 33 percent. 
  According to IBOPE experts, it is still too early to 
attribute Cardoso's dropping popularity to the formalization of 
the alliance between the PSDB and the Liberal Front Party. They 
admit, however, that there is such a possibility, as the drop 
coincides with the problems that Cardoso has confronted within 
his own party, in which some sectors have rejected the alliance 
and have even threatened to sponsor a new ticket at the PSDB 
convention on 14 May in Contagem (Minas Gerais), with Deputy for 
Bahia Waldir Pires being kind of an anti-candidate. 
  Progressive Renewal Party Senator for Santa Catarina 
Esperidiao Amin's popularity remains at 3 percent for all 
simulated elections. Liberal Party Deputy for Rio de Janeiro 
Flavio Rocha scored 2 percent in all cases.

<F P=106> [Castello's column, by Marcelo Pontes: "Understanding the </F>
Latest Poll Results"] 
  [Text] At first glance, one of the most striking findings 
of the latest IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics 
Institute] election poll--the decline of Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva from 37 percent to 31 percent once Jose Sarney enters the 
race--is not, strictly speaking, a surprising revelation. 
  Since last year, whenever Sarney is included in IBOPE's 
scenarios, Lula's rating drops. Today, neither is Lula's 31 
percent his most modest performance vis-a-vis Sarney, nor does 
the former president's current 13 percent represent his best 
score against the PT [Workers Party] candidate. Last September, 
Lula had 27 percent to Sarney's 14 percent. The tally was 26 to 
12 percent in January of this year, and 30 percent to 11 percent 
at the end of March. 
  It is interesting to observe how Lula and Sarney, whose 
ideological traits differ so greatly, have such similar profiles 
in the IBOPE surveys. Both do better with low-income voters who 
have less schooling and live in the Northeast. 
  Sarney has hovered in the 11 to 14 percent range since last 
year, fluctuating with the drubbings he gets. He has still not 
been heavily attacked enough by the opposing candidates for 
measures to be taken of the resistance of the armor that keeps 
him stuck in the same IBOPE bracket, regardless of the changing 
cast of characters of candidates around him. Quercia enters, 
Maluf leaves, Amin and Flavio Rocha appear, Fernando Henrique 
settles in--and Sarney holds on to his captive electorate. 
  There are two ways of interpreting Lula's persistent 
leadership in the polls. One is the reading given by IBOPE. The 
institute's experts think it is strange that Lula does not get 
60 percent of voter intentions when he is not in office, is not 
living in a glass house, has become the counterpoint to all the 
bad that Fernando Collar embodied, and has passed unscathed 
through the tough times experienced by politicians in general in 
the past three years. 
  The other, and more accurate, way to look at this is to 
consider Lula's first-place position as an electoral miracle. He 
has a little more than 30 percent thanks to the virtues that, in 
IBOPE's opinion, ought to propel him up to 60 percent. And one 
of the reasons he is not reaching that 60 percent is that his 
face is not on everyone's TV sets in prime time as is Fernando 
Henrique's, for example. 
  The slippage of two or three percentage points in Fernando 
Henrique's rating compared with the previous poll falls within 
the survey's sampling error, IBOPE says. What is most important 
to the tucano candidate are the trends recorded 
within his own universe of likely voters. 
  Although he has not risen in the general index, Fernando 
Henrique has improved his profile in the heartland of the 
survey. In that fat slice of voters who have gone no further in 
school than 4th grade--50 percent of the electorate--he has 
climbed from 8 to 12 percent. In the 25 percent slice of the 
electorate that finished 8th grade, Fernando Henrique has risen 
from 13 to 19 percent. In the other groups (high school and 
college graduates), his standing is stable. In other words, 
Fernando Henrique has grown in stature right where he needs to 
grow--among the 75 percent of voters who will actually control 
the outcome of the election. 
  This evolution of the tucano candidate is 
consistent with the findings in another variant of the survey, 
the one that groups voters by family income bracket. Fernando 
Henrique has improved his likability rating from 6 to 10 percent 
among the multitude of Brazilians who earn no more than one 
minimum monthly wage. And among the neighboring population that 
earns from one to two minimum wages he has jumped from 10 to 14 
percent. 
  Separating voters by regions, Fernando Henrique turns in his 
best performances in the Northeast, home to almost 30 percent of 
the electorate (where he went from 6 to 11 percent), and in the 
South (he increased from 13 to 17 percent). 
  Seen as a whole, the poll sends certain messages. One of 
them 
is that Fernando Henrique still depends on the favorable breeze 
from the real, a monetary unit that has a flair for 
becoming election currency. Another is that Sarney is 
establishing himself in the mind of the voter-in-the-street as a 
more viable candidate than Quercia, which does not mean he will 
have the same success among voters in the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] who will choose their candidate in a 
primary. 
  A third message is the remarkable 10-point (from 39 to 49 
percent) growth in the index that measures voter rejection of 
Leonel Brizola. Pollsters did not ask about motivation for this 
change, but suspects it is a repercussion of the numbers-game 
scandal in Rio de Janeiro that involves politicians associated 
with the former governor. 
  But none of these indications is more important than the 
certainty that a lot of water has yet to flow under the bridge. 
The election campaign will not heat up until after the World 
Cup, and will not go into high gear until after 2 August, when 
free radio and TV air time becomes available.

<F P=106> [Commentary by PT (Sao Paulo) Federal Deputy Jose Genoino: </F>
"The Next Administration's Agenda"] 
  [Text] Now that the candidates for the presidency have been 
pretty well determined, some questions that will be hard to 
address are already arising with respect to possible election 
results scenarios. Some of them grow out of the succession 
context itself, which makes a concise exposition of this picture 
a useful exercise. The most obvious aspect that strikes us is 
the fragmentation and divisiveness in the parties, from Centrist 
Left to far Right, vis-a-vis the candidates who have announced. 
If an alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] and PFL [Liberal Front Party] is confirmed, it is certain 
that the tucanos will not march hand-in-hand behind 
the Fernando Henrique candidacy. The dissidence within the PSDB 
will benefit Lula, who will also be able to count on support 
from the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], even with Brizola as PDT 
candidate. The PFL, in turn, will be unable to maintain unity in 
support of FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso]; liberal factions 
will back Quercia or Sarney or perhaps even a candidate from the 
PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. As for the PMDB, it is very 
likely that dissidence will develop and the disaffected will 
favor Fernando Henrique. Now that Maluf has withdrawn, part of 
the PPR will look for a more centrist candidate. Party 
fragmentation is even greater in the compositions for the 
governorship races. 
  Some conclusions can be drawn from looking at this 
situation. 
First, there are no consolidated political parties, except on 
the Left. Second, some of the Right, stung by the impeachment 
[preceding word in English] and the corruption scandals and 
having no chance of election success, is opting for a candidate 
that historically has allied with the Left. Third, the Centrist 
Left, notably the PSDB and the so-called ethical wing of the 
PMDB, has run aground in terms of a platform. The PSDB, in order 
to become electorally viable, wrecked the social democratic 
ideology when it sought an alliance with the PFL. This party, 
with the exception of a few respected politicians, is 
characterized by conservatism and the politics of self-interest. 
It so happens that the PSDB, although providing the top man on 
the slate, comes to the coalition as a minority partner since 
the PFL has, and will probably maintain, a larger representation 
in Congress. This means that a potential Fernando Henrique 
administration is likely to have to look more to the Right, 
rather than to the Left as some analysts assume, to form 
coalitions. 
  The ethical wing of the PMDB, in turn, will not easily be 
able to free itself from Quercia or Sarney, The most it could do 
would be to back FHC. Part of the Centrist Left is now working 
with groups further to the right than those with which it had 
recently planned to break. From the standpoint of alliances, 
whether under a Fernando Henrique or a PMDB government, the 
profile would not be much different than Sarney's Democratic 
Alliance government. Instead of a program-oriented 
administration as was assumed would develop, we would have a 
government formed from an alliance of the Left with the Centrist 
Left: once again, a condominium government. 
  The fourth conclusion pertains to Lula's probable victory. 
Even if we anticipate significant growth in the legislative 
delegations from the party forces that support Lula, it is 
unlikely they will achieve a majority. In that case, Lula would 
have to look more towards the center for support. This support 
will be easier to garner if he wins the first round, or if his 
opponent in the runoff is not FHC. Otherwise, the contest could 
open rifts that would be very hard to close. Then only the 
political skills of the government could cultivate coalitions 
over time. This implies that we in the PT must get ready for a 
relatively difficult start to our administration in terms of 
political support. 
  All this only serves to confirm the theory that the party 
and 
electoral system ought to favor political and electoral 
alliances so as to produce majorities that are able to govern. 
Our party and electoral system has shown itself unable to foster 
the formation of political majorities. Neither the Constituent 
Assembly nor the constitutional revision have found a solution 
for this impasse that is at the root of the persistent 
political/institutional crisis. Consequently, we are seeing 
reproduced the precarious conditions for the implementation of 
government programs and for administrative effectiveness, and we 
find that the electorate is rapidly becoming disillusioned with 
those who were anointed at the ballot box. Nothing would 
indicate that this situation will change radically during the 
next administration. 
  Besides the difficulties inherent in the institutional 
system, the next administration will have to deal with three 
crucial items on the government agenda if it is to prevent 
possible crises. The first relates to the fact that the rules by 
which democratic institutions operate have become terribly 
outdated. This problem affects issues such as the duties and 
relationships between the three branches of government; the 
imbalances in our federalism, where we find disproportionate 
responsibilities and tax resources in the relationship between 
the federal government and the state and municipal governments; 
the party and electoral system, etc. 
  The second point pertains to governability and the 
government 
program. The next government must have enough political power to 
deal with the economic and social agenda. It must be able to 
promote growth and distribution in income; it must be able to 
promote the democratization of property ownership and combat 
social disenfranchisement. 
  Lastly, the third point on the agenda refers to negotiation 
of the foreign debt and the insertion of Brazil into the world 
market as something other than a junior participant. There are 
two prerequisites if Brazil is to take a more favorable position 
on this issue: a favorable international context and a 
government that is politically strong from the domestic 
standpoint. Only the conjunction of these conditions can enable 
the next government the ability to stanch the hemorrhage of 
resources caused by the commitments of a foreign debt that is 
not always legitimate. As we can see, both the presidential 
succession picture and the agenda that awaits the next 
administration feature complex problems that are difficult to 
solve. If it is true that elections represent an opportunity for 
renewal of promises and hopes, a time of passions, neither the 
politicians nor the voters can lack the sense of moderation that 
responsibility and realism demand of us.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Real Expectations"] </F>
  [Text] To what extent is an economic plan that depends on 
fiscal austerity, and which is crumbling away because of the 
congressional delay in approving the 1994 federal budget, solid? 
How can this plan be implemented when no progress has been made 
in the constitutional revision process concerning tax reforms 
and the streamlining of the state, and when expenditures 
continue to be greater than revenues? 
  These doubts, which have overwhelmed economic agents and 
have 
provoked two days of sharp declines in the Rio de Janeiro and 
Sao Paulo stock markets, were only temporarily dispelled 
yesterday when Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero announced that 
the date and details for the implementation of the real will be 
announced on 9 May. 
  JORNAL DO BRASIL has published a study by economist Eduardo 
Felipe Ohana, former deputy secretary in the Finance Ministry 
and an expert in public finances, who has shown that it will not 
be possible to obtain a budget surplus this year, despite former 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's assurance that a 
budget surplus would be guaranteed by the economic stabilization 
and deindexation plan, through the creation of the real. 
  According to Ohana, the 1994 draft budget that was just 
submitted to Congress will not yield the expected $7 billion 
surplus but will, rather, result unexpectedly in a $15 billion 
deficit. The reasons for this unexpected reversion of trends 
are the excessive increase in personnel and health spending that 
was transferred from the social security budget to the federal 
budget, and the excessive growth in payments to federal 
government employees and social security beneficiaries. 
  By contrast, economic deindexation and the reduction of 
monthly inflation to virtually zero will do away with financial 
speculation. Consequently, fiscal revenues from the IOF 
[financial operations tax] and IPMF [provisional tax on 
financial operations] will decline markedly. Ohana estimates 
this drop, which was not duly measured by the formulators of the 
budget, in $3.5 billion. To make things worse, the government 
will have to adopt a tighter monetary policy, with high real 
interest rates, to prevent a flight of savings toward 
consumption from stimulating demand and from pushing prices in 
reals upwards. This will put an additional burden on public 
debt servicing. 
  Some economists, including some of those working for the 
government, have conceded that the failure of the constitutional 
revision process has jeopardized the possibility of eliminating 
the deficit. Following the virtual deadlock of the proposed 
constitutional changes in the economic area, which would entail 
the revision by Congress of monopolies and the treatment of 
foreign capital, no one believes in the possibility of 
far-reaching reforms concerning tax laws, such as a redefinition 
of the federal government's accord with states and 
municipalities, or a reformulation of the bankrupt social 
security system. 
  A redefinition of the size and functions of the state was 
and 
continues to be fundamental to eliminating the tax burden 
Brazilian society would have to pay to maintain the public 
sector in operation. From there on, it would also be possible 
to make decisive progress in the privatization program, and the 
proceeds obtained through the sale of properties considered to 
be superfluous for the new Brazilian state could be used to 
repay Treasury debts. 
  Because these premises appear to be no longer feasible, the 
path for stabilization has become narrower and more dangerous. 
Brazilian society is therefore anxiously waiting to hear 
encouraging words from Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero when he 
introduces the real on 9 May.

<F P=106> [Castello's Column, by Marcelo Pontes: "The Clash Between </F>
Osiris and Clovis"] 
  [Text] The clash between Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes 
Filho and the executive secretary of the Ministry of Finance, 
Clovis Carvalho, is not one of these feuds that generate 
emotions every day, but the electrical charge released on the 
day when the two fell out left resentments that are still giving 
Minister Rubens Ricupero a headache. 
  Osiris got Fernando Henrique Cardoso to sign, on his final 
day as finance minister (Wednesday of Holy Week), the proposal 
to modernize the Federal Revenue Secretariat. A career civil 
servant, professor of tax law, and very familiar as few others 
are with the machinery by which taxes are collected, Osiris 
thinks the time has come to improve working conditions at a 
government agency that has proven its efficiency. 
  That is why he conceived the idea of setting up a treasury 
intelligence service to uncover the more sophisticated kinds of 
tax crimes that cannot be reached by traditional audits. The 
proposal gives the revenue service a more dynamic operating 
structure and enables it to hire additional inspectors. 
  A happy Osiris told the people at Revenue about the 
minister's signature and awaited publication in the OFFICIAL 
GAZETTE. He waited a week. He sent some of his staffers to make 
inquiries at the Ministry of Finance, to find out what happened. 
He learned then that the proposal had gotten stalled in the 
hands of the executive secretary, Clovis Carvalho. 
  So Osiris phoned Clovis. The conversation began cordially 
but 
ended disastrously. Clovis confirmed that he was holding up the 
proposal because the text contained some details he did not 
agree with. A few words, he said, had to be changed. The 
situation was intriguing, to say the least. An executive 
secretary of a ministry holds up a document signed by his 
superior and virtually revokes it at the instant when the 
transition from one minister to another allows a decision-making 
vacuum to occur in the public administration. 
  Extremely protective of his prerogatives and political 
clout, 
since in a span of few months he had emerged from the anonymity 
of the rank and file of the civil service to become a candidate 
for minister, Osiris, the real name of the "lion" of the Revenue 
Secretariat, told Clovis Carvalho on the phone that he would 
tell his staff and the press who was holding up the proposal to 
modernize the revenue service. 
  Clovis reacted by saying that Osiris was blackmailing him. 
Osiris argued that he would simply be speaking the truth, as 
confirmed by Clovis himself. When Clovis said for the second 
time that he was being blackmailed, Osiris went into a rage and 
abruptly told him, in stentorian tones, where to go. Then he 
hung up. 
  Osiris then warned his staff that if the proposal Clovis was 
holding up were not released, he would resign from the Revenue 
Secretariat. He did not convey this threat to either the 
minister of finance nor Planalto Palace, from which he had 
departed to take the helm of the tax-collecting machine. 
  Minister Ricupero went into action, but the issue is still 
unresolved, almost three weeks later. Osiris is feeling 
resentful. Clovis has the proposal. One considers himself strong 
enough to take on any fight. The other has carried to an extreme 
the principal trait for which he is known within the economic 
team: that of being a tough guy, the man assigned to say "no" to 
anyone, no matter who, when necessary. 
  This time, Clovis said "no" to Osiris but also to the 
previous minister, who had put him in the job and worked to keep 
him there under Ricupero. If he wants to fight with Osiris, 
Clovis, who is very close to the rest of the economic team, 
should not be all alone.

<F P=106> [Column: Political Things, by Dora Kramer: "You Can't Argue </F>
With Cowardice"] 
  [Text] After six months, several attempts, and practically 
no results, the constitutional revision will be officially 
interred this week. The Requiem Mass, as assistant rapporteur 
Gustavo Krause put it, was celebrated last Wednesday "to the 
sounds of Minister Ricupero's Gregorian chant." Krause was 
referring to the finance minister's last-ditch effort to salvage 
votes on some items. 
  Rubens Ricupero's hopes were as commendable as they were 
futile, since nothing, really nothing, can be done when the 
absence of a political compact is actually a smoke screen for 
cowardice. And so much the worse when people choose to blame 
others for the absence of character that enables one to 
acknowledge one's own mistakes. 
  That was the case with all those who, preoccupied with 
October's election, fled from a confrontation on fundamental 
issues. For public consumption, they pretended that subjects 
like ending the monopolies, tax and social security reform, and 
changes in the election system had nothing to do with the daily 
lives of the citizens. It was easier to make it look as though 
only those people out there in Brasilia need be 
concerned about all that. This is false, because everyone 
retires, pays taxes, votes, and--especially--prefers not to see 
his money used to finance someone's excessive privilege. 
  What is serious about this deceptive posture is the criminal 
significance it harbors. The case of Petrobras [Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation] is an example. TV ads--paid for by the 
taxpayers, since they were financed by tithes deducted from the 
salaries of its employees--repeated over and over that ending 
the petroleum monopoly was synonymous with handing Brazil over 
to foreign interests [entreguismo]. By ignoring the 
modernity of the concept, actually so decrepit as to 
border on the sclerotic, the sponsors of this campaign are lying 
to the public. 
  Why else didn't they depict on television the money pit that 
is Petrobras today? Why didn't they answer Nelson Jobim, 
rapporteur of the revision, when in an official capacity he 
sought to find out how much the state enterprise paid the 
government in dividends last year? Because then, by presenting 
the figures that demonstrate the disgraceful gigantism on which 
society earns no return, they would be exposing what lies behind 
the ostensible protection of the national patrimony: the defense 
of personal privileges in the case of the employees, and 
protection of a robust cash cow, in the case of the politicians. 
  Since prudence dictates that one avoid generalizations like 
the plague, it is really better to name names. Here we have the 
case, made to order, of the PT. With its candidate for president 
of Brazil ranking well ahead in the polls, the party should long 
since have realized its folly. Or does the PT intend to govern 
with the tax system as it is? Or will it keep Social Security 
the way it is now? Of course not. 
  Well, the party that fled the revision out of fear of facing 
issues that would expose the clout of the vested interests and 
inevitably result in breaking their stranglehold will, if it 
takes over in 1995, have nowhere to run. And there we encounter, 
once again, a typical case of ideological dishonesty. Afraid to 
lose votes, Lula has tried to serve two masters. 
  He neither allowed the party to stand in opposition to the 
corporativist electorate nor let the PT defend nonstatist 
positions during the debate. Of course he needs the vested 
interests, but he also needs the middle class, which does not 
depend on the State. So he is trying to have it both ways. 
  Obviously, if he is elected, he will make someone mad. One 
of 
the two sides will soon realize it has been deceived. Had it 
entered the debate now, the PT would always have had the option 
to let the reforms take place, vote against them, and pretend it 
had nothing to do with the outcome. With Lula in Planalto 
Palace, things change a little. His party will not have a 
majority. 
  Therefore, he will need to play with the same political 
skill 
that he now says the leaders of the revision process lacked. 
Since he will need the reforms, the currency that the liberals 
will demand in exchange will be precisely the end of the 
monopolies. And then, since the PT will no longer have the 
alternative of pretending it has nothing to do with the matter, 
its only option will be to negotiate. Or to submit.

  [Text] Pretoria, 10 May (PL) -- The Cuban and South African 
presidents, Fidel Castro and Nelson Mandela, respectively, will 
meet in Pretoria tomorrow. It will be Mandela's first act 
following the inaugural of the new South African Government. 
  The Cuban chief of state confirmed the news to the Cuban 
journalists who are covering the official activities of 
Mandela's investiture. Castro said "insofar as we work to 
develop fraternal and affectionate ties between the two 
peoples," there probably is no other nation that could have a 
possible broad collaboration as South Africa and Cuba.

  [Text] Pretoria, 10 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President 
Fidel Castro praised the Angolan people and leadership's 
historical recognition of the cooperation given by the Caribbean 
nation to that state in southern Africa. 
  During an interview with the media that have accompanied him 
on his visit to the Republic of South Africa, Fidel Castro said 
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sincerely expressed 
with "heartfelt words that came from the bottom of his soul" 
what the aid given by Cuba represented for his country. 
  Today, the two leaders held a meeting following the 
inauguration of antiapartheid leader Nelson Mandela as South 
African president, an event that shook the world on 10 May. 
Referring to the meeting, the Cuban head of state said dos 
Santos also told him that Cuban cooperation was important not 
only for Angola but also for South Africa and the rest of that 
vast continent. He added that dos Santos' words shook him when 
he referred to the unselfish aid given by the Cuban people to 
that region of the planet. 
  Today, Fidel Castro talked with a dozen African heads of 
state and government who attended Mandela's inauguration, 
including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President 
San Nujoma, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, and Mozambican 
President Joaquim Chissano. 
  He also talked with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, 
Israeli 
President Ezer Weizman, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, 
and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, among other 
personalities invited to Mandela's inauguration, which was 
attended by 150,000 guests, including 42 leaders. 
  PRENSA LATINA learned that the Cuban leader met with the new 
South African president, with whom he will hold official talks 
tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By Maria Elena Gil] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria, 10 May (PL) -- Today in this capital, 
Cuban President Fidel Castro said, after attending the 
swearing-in ceremony of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, 
that South Africa has been called upon to exert a strong 
influence throughout the region. 
  In this afternoon's meeting with the team of reporters who 
accompanied him to the Mandela ceremonies, the Cuban president 
described the South African president's election as an enormous 
victory for the people of South Africa and for the world's 
progressive forces. 
  It is a rebirth and proof that great victories can be 
achieved in the wake of international disasters which have 
occurred in the unipolar world in which we now live, Fidel 
Castro said. 
  Asked by PRENSA LATINA about possibilities for cooperation 
with the new South African Government, Cuba's top leader said: 
"There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we 
share with South Africa." 
  The country has, on the one hand, great development and 
standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous 
social needs in the areas of public health, employment, 
education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to 
appreciate in our talks with members of the South African 
cabinet, Castro said. 
  Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the 
possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South 
Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties 
between both peoples. 
  Regarding his first visit to this country, which a few years 
ago was Cuba's battlefield enemy, Castro said: "We were treated 
very respectfully by all sectors of society, not only from the 
ANC [African National Congress], but also from the Indian, 
white, and mestizo sectors, taking into account that this is a 
multiracial country in which millions of people feel the need to 
cooperate with one another." 
  There are two South Africas, the Cuban president said. At 
various occasions in South African history, there were times of 
violent clashes, but now there is a new South Africa in which 
there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba. 
  Castro believes the ANC government has a very difficult task 
ahead of it, because "even though it is a relatively developed 
country, there is a huge population that has lived for a long 
time under apartheid, and it has the needs and yearnings of a 
majority which has been discriminated against." 
  When referring to his first visit to this southern African 
nation, Fidel Castro said, "with few countries do we have such 
heart-felt and fraternal ties as those we have cultivated over 
so many years with South Africa and the ANC. [no closing

  Every time one speaks to a South African, one first notices 
the great spiritual possibilities that exist, Castro said. 
  In discussing diplomatic relations, Castro said, "We should 
consider them when it is right for them, at an opportune 
moment." Cuba will be very honored to develop its relations 
with South Africa, he said. 
  I see evolving events in this country as something 
marvelous, 
and my greatest wish is that this country achieves peace and 
harmony, something we all must contribute to enable the efforts 
and sacrifices made by this a country to serve as a model for 
the entire world, the Cuban leader underscored. 
  Regarding today's swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed 
by more than 5,000 South Africans at the Union Building 
amphitheater, Castro said: "The coming together of all South 
Africans and all ethnic groups was beautiful. We hope that the 
process continues to progress in this direction." 
  Today in South Africa, we helped bury apartheid and assisted 
in the birth of liberty, Fidel Castro said. 
  This is the first time that a high-ranking official Cuban 
delegation has stepped onto South African soil. 
  Both countries faced each other on the battlefield between 
1976-91, when Cuban troops went to assist Angola at their 
request, to safeguard its independence and territory, which had 
been threatened by military forces backed by the racist Pretoria 
regime.

  [Text] Pretoria, 11 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President 
Fidel Castro met privately with his South African counterpart, 
Nelson Mandela, whose inauguration he attended here yesterday. 
Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his 
official residence where they held talks behind closed doors. 
  In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro 
pointed out that the rise to power of the African National 
Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between 
the two countries. "Probably with no other country is there the 
possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South 
Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties 
between both peoples," Castro said. 
  After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted 
an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting 
Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel 
where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation 
that accompanied him. 
  Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation, 
whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for 
independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: "There 
are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South 
Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now 
there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and 
affection for Cuba." 
  The statesman confirmed he has been treated very 
respectfully 
by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit 
here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to 
harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results 
of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the 
entire world. 
  He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural 
ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the 
Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state 
and heads of government from approximately 40 countries. 
  Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he 
also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from 
Africa and the Middle East.

  [Text] Pretoria, 11 May (PL) -- Today, the South African 
Government of Nelson Mandela adopted one of its first foreign 
policy decisions and established diplomatic relations with Cuba, 
it was announced officially in this capital. 
  Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and South 
African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed the protocol that 
establishes a new status in relations between Pretoria and 
Havana. 
  Up until now, the two governments had not maintained 
diplomatic ties because of the Caribbean island authorities' 
rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of apartheid. 
  Less than 48 hours after assuming the presidency, Nelson 
Mandela, leader of the African National Congress (ANC), 
finalized the government decision, reaffirming the relations of 
friendship and solidarity maintained for years between Cuba and 
the then-outlawed ANC. 
  Regarding the possibilities of cooperation between Cuba and 
the South African state, Cuban President Fidel Castro had told 
PRENSA LATINA: There are few countries that have the fraternal 
links that we share with South Africa. 
  The country has, on the one hand, great development and 
standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous 
social needs in the areas of public health, employment, 
education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to 
appreciate in our talks with members of the South African 
cabinet, Castro said. 
  Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the 
possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South 
Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties 
between both peoples. 
  After signing the protocol, Alfredo Nzo, former secretary of 
international relations of the ANC, told Robaina that the new 
South Africa did not want Fidel Castro to end his visit before 
making this decision. 
  For his part, Robaina underlined the importance of the 
signing of the agreement, not only because of its great 
significance, but because it is the first protocol signed by Nzo 
as foreign minister. Cuba has close cooperative relations with 
other African states in the areas of health, construction, 
sports, and education, which can also be extended to South 
Africa, he said. Hundreds of ANC youths have studied in the past 
at education centers in Cuba, it was noted. 
  There were times of serious confrontation between the two 
states, Fidel Castro pointed out during his visit, recalling 
Cuba's international opposition to the aggressive policy 
maintained by the dismantled apartheid regime against the South 
African black majority and the peoples of Namibia and Angola. 
"Now there is a new South Africa, where peace, respect, and 
love toward Cuba exist," he stated. 
  The Cuban delegation, headed by President Fidel Castro, 
concluded its first official and friendly visit to South Africa 
today. The Cuban delegation began its visit Monday to attend 
Mandela's inauguration. Mandela is the first black president of 
the country, which now has unequivocally left behind more than 
three centuries of racial discrimination. 
  In terms of Cuba's representation, Roberto Robaina was 
accompanied at the signing ceremony by Angel Dalmau, Cuban 
ambassador in Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science, 
technology, and environment; and Marcos Rodriguez, diplomatic 
counselor, who will temporarily represent the Cuban Government 
in Pretoria.

  [Text] Salvador, Brazil, 11 May (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro arrived today in this northeastern Brazilian city 
during a service stopover on his return flight from South Africa 
to Cuba. 
  The Cuban president visited Pretoria, the South African 
capital, where he participated in the inauguration of President 
Nelson Mandela. 
  The Cubana de Aviacion flight landed in the Dos de Julio Air 
Base in the capital of Bahia state, where Fidel Castro and his 
entourage were greeted by current Governor Antonio Imbassahy, 
former governor Carlos Magalhaes, Ramon Sanchez Parodi, who is 
Cuban ambassador to Brazil, and other local personalities. 
  This is the second time the Cuban president has visited 
Salvador and the fourth time he has visited Brazil. 
  Fidel visited Brasilia in early 1990 for the presidential 
inauguration that year. In June 1992 he attended the world 
summit on environment in Rio de Janeiro, and in July 1993 he 
visited Salvador Bahia to participate in the third 
Ibero-American conference. 
  According to official sources cited by the local press, the 
Cuban president will remain approximately 12 hours in Brazilian 
territory, although no official agenda was announced for his 
visit. 
  Organizations of friendship and solidarity with Cuba as well 
as other associations in Bahia said they wanted to give Fidel 
Castro a great reception.

  [Text] Salvador, Brazil, 12 May (PL) -- Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco has welcomed Cuban President Fidel Castro and 
reiterated the appreciation and friendship he feels for the 
Caribbean island. 
  In a message delivered to the Cuban leader by state 
government officials upon arriving in this city, Franco recalled 
his personal meeting with Castro during the third Ibero-American 
summit of 1993 and expressed his satisfaction that they will 
meet again during the fourth meeting of this forum to be held in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June. 
  In a reply note, Fidel Castro was deeply grateful for the 
welcome given by his counterpart and noted he and the delegation 
accompanying him felt good to be surrounded by the warmth and 
unrivaled friendship of the Bahia people. 
  I carry with me the unforgettable memory of our days in this 
city that hosted the Latin American summit, and I will gladly 
greet you again in Cartagena de Indias, the statesman noted. 
  My stay has been brief but my fondness for this friendly, 
exceptional, and extraordinary country will be eternal, Castro 
added. 
  Upon arriving yesterday evening, the Caribbean leader met 
with Bahia State Governor Antonio Imbassahy, during the only 
official meeting of his stopover on his return from South 
Africa, where he attended the inauguration of Nelson Mandela. 
  Castro, Imbassahy, and Former Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes, who stepped down to work on his electoral campaign 
for the general elections in October, held a cordial 
conversation and dined together at Salvador's government palace. 
  They discussed the U.S. embargo on Cuba, which the 
Brazilians 
flatly rejected, matters of bilateral interest, and other issues. 
  The Brazilian media highlighted the brief visit by the Cuban 
head of state, who has visited this South American country on 
three previous occasions.

  [Text] Havana, 12 May (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry 
has issued a declaration noting that the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Cuba and South Africa is more than 
a formality, it is an action of historic significance that 
encompasses dear aspirations of the two nations. 
  The document states: The electoral victory of the African 
National Congress headed by undisputed leader Nelson Mandela was 
a victory for the progressive people of the world and paved the 
way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba 
and South Africa. 
  After noting that the agreement signed by the foreign 
ministers of the two countries was one of the first 
international acts carried out by the new government, the 
document states that there are many broad possibilities for 
cooperation. 
  The document views as fundamental "the commitment to work 
unitedly to turn common dreams of independence, equality, and 
social well-being into reality." 
  The declaration adds: "Generous Cuban blood has enriched the 
African soil, and for Cuba it is an honor and also a compelling 
duty to take part with its South African brothers in the 
beginning of this new page in their history. 
  The declaration also expresses Cuba's interest in 
contributing modestly to the edification of a multiracial and 
truly democratic South Africa. 
  The declaration expresses the wish that "the international 
community be consistent in its support for the process that put 
an end to apartheid, and grant the new government the 
cooperation necessary to secure its goals of peace, harmony, and 
progress."

  [Text] Havana, 10 May (PL) -- Today, Army General Raul 
Castro, defense minister of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed 
Forces, said the greatest attributes of the new South African 
president, Nelson Mandela, are his iron will and his 
intelligence. 
  The minister made a brief statement to the media at the 
conclusion of the main event that paid tribute to the Cuban 
fighters who died in Africa and hailed the victory of the 
African National Congress and its leader. 
  Raul Castro said Mandela was able to achieve victory because 
of his great intelligence, which he demonstrated with his 
successful performance in a multinational, multiracial, and 
multireligious country that has witnessed great hatred because 
of discriminatory practices. 
  Raul Castro concluded: We only wish him to continue 
achieving 
victories, as he has to this point, during his journey along the 
lengthy and difficult road ahead of him.

<F P=106> [PRENSA LATINA at 1934 GMT on 11 May transmits a service </F>
message asking that the following item be "killed"] 
  [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice 
president of the Council of Ministers, said in Havana today at a 
meeting with U.S. professors and students that economic changes 
are being made in Cuba to adapt and strengthen socialism. 
  Fernandez spoke for over two hours about the country's 
economic and social situation with a group of four professors 
and 18 students from New York City's Columbia University. 
  The visitors, most of whom are economics and finance majors, 
have been in the country since last week gathering information 
on the mixed partnership system and on foreign investment 
legislation. 
  The ranking official said the measures taken in the farming 
sector -- the creation of the basic cooperative production units 
system, the self-employment law, and the foreign investments law 
-- will not change the socialist nature of the Cuban political 
system. 
  Fernandez added that in the 35 years since the revolutionary 
victory on 1 January 1959, the country has made noteworthy 
success in public health, including a life expectancy of 75 
years and an infant mortality rate that is comparable to those 
of highly developed countries. 
  The Cuban people are resisting the U.S. policy of hostility, 
not surrendering to it because they want to safeguard those 
achievements, Fernandez said. 
  He emphasized that joint ventures have been established with 
Canadian, French, and Swedish firms on the island to exploit 
oil, and with other countries to exploit citrus, nickel, and 
mining with good results. 
  Fernandez told the university students, who are U.S., 
Japanese, Canadian, and Latin American citizens, that the last 
eight U.S. Administrations have been at odds with Cuba, but Cuba 
does not profess enmity toward the people of the United States. 
  The visitors asked Fernandez about the possibility of Cuban 
authorities considering investments that are 100 percent foreign 
capital as well as quicker changes in the economic sphere. 
  Fernandez said the Cuban authorities are willing to discuss 
any issue to achieve communication and peace based on respect 
for the right to self-determination, sovereignty, and their 
political system.

  [Text] Panama, 10 May (PL) -- Panamanian President-elect 
Ernesto Perez Balladares said on the night of 9 May that during 
his administration, Panama will maintain first-rate and 
respectful relations with Cuba. 
  Asked about the topic by journalists, Perez Balladares noted 
that relations with Cuba will be the same as those maintained 
with any other nation. Perez Balladares, a 47-year-old 
businessman, added that relations between the two nations will 
be characterized by respect for the systems prevailing in each 
country and noninterference in their respective internal affairs. 
  Panamanian-Cuban relations were virtually annulled following 
the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 December 1989 and operate only 
at the level of acting charge d'affaires. 
  Perez Balladares, who will be proclaimed winner of the 8 May 
elections on 12 or 13 May, was nominated by the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, which the U.S. military intervention 
removed from power.

  [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- Ernesto Melendez, minister 
president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation, has 
said economic relations with Latin America have a promising 
future because of the great potential for developing trade, the 
sale of nontraditional products, and the assimilation of 
investment. 
  In an interview with TRABAJADORES, Melendez noted that Latin 
America is opening up to pharmaceutical and biotechnological 
products and medical equipment, which constitute new Cuban 
exports. 
  Melendez added that in terms of cooperation in the 
production 
sector, joint enterprises and associations linked to areas such 
as construction, textiles, energy, the mechanical industry, and 
services have been created. 
  Melendez labeled the process of joint economic activities 
with Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador as 
thriving, and he added that this process is expanding in the 
Caribbean through trade relations with the Dominican Republic, 
Jamaica, Guyana, and other nations. 
  Melendez emphasized the existence of a growing awareness of 
the Cuban situation; new legislation; good training of its 
workers, technicians, and professionals; and the efficient 
infrastructure created within the past 30 years. 
  In terms of economic integration with Latin America and the 
Caribbean, Melendez stressed that various models and free trade 
agreements among countries of the region are being considered. 
In this regard, Melendez said two aspects are being taken into 
account: the need to promote joint investigations for economic 
development and the understanding that this economic development 
must take place amid social equity. 
  Melendez concluded by saying that the documents of the 
Economic Commission for Latin America establish that more than 
200 million people out of the area's total population of 450 
million live in poverty, while the infant mortality rate is 57 
per every 1,000 live births.

  [Text] Havana, 10 May (PL) -- Today, the Health Ministry 
announced it will adopt a plan to control and sell medicine to 
ensure that medicine is acquired by people who really need it 
and to overcome availability problems. The official GRANMA 
daily reports that this plan is part of an integral strategy to 
increase national production of pharmaceutical items. The 
strategy includes the implementation of a control system, strict 
prescriptions, and specific uses for medicine. There also will 
be more support for herbal medicine. 
  Health Minister Julio Teja reported that foreign exchange 
has 
been earmarked to support a more independent and efficient 
import strategy. My ministry is making great efforts to ensure 
the supply of 352 medicines considered to be essential for the 
people's health, Minister Teja said. This includes 73 that are 
already guaranteed by means of a control card and that benefit 2 
million people. 
  The health minister said the production of Priority 2 
medicines included in the pharmaceutical inventory will grow 
until it reaches levels similar to those of 1992. 
  The medical-pharmaceutical industry has outlined a plan to 
secure materials, and much of the raw materials necessary are 
already in the country, GRANMA reports. 
  The minister noted that this industry's production, which in 
1993 generated 59.7 million pesos (the same amount in dollars, 
at the official exchange rate), will climb to approximately 84 
million in 1994, a figure similar to that of 1992. 
  One initial measure designed to control medicinal supplies 
and avert black market profiteering will be to make drugstores 
more accessible to the population. This group includes medicine 
freely sold whenever available. It includes aspirin, 
antiseptics, digestion medicine, analgesic balms, and dry 
lotions. The plan also calls for linking medical centers with 
nearby pharmacies where patients can acquire prescribed medicine. 
  At the same time, a significant number of pediatric, 
gynecological, clinical, and surgical products will be included 
in intrahospital pharmacies where medicine prescribed at the 
institutions can be acquired. 
  These control measures are designed to permit outpatients 
and 
hospital-released patients to buy the medicine prescribed by 
their doctors. 
  Deadlines also will be set for purchasing antibiotics and 
chemotherapy medicine in light of the fact that the 
nonacquisition of these products within an established timeframe 
makes their use unnecessary because a medical reevaluation of 
the patient becomes necessary. The plan foresees the creation of 
a corps of inspectors that will function at all levels to 
oversee the process and guarantee its efficiency.

  [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- The Cuban Workers Federation 
(CTC) expressed here today its solid support for the adjustment 
measures to cleanse the country's public finances, adding that 
its members have a starring role in the adoption of these 
measures. 
  TRABAJADORES newspaper, mouthpiece of the CTC, underscored 
that the recent decision by the National Assembly of the 
People's Government (Parliament) reflects policies designed to 
cleanse public finances, to eliminate excess money in 
circulation, and to restore economic development. 
  The CTC added that the drafting of policies to end the 
crisis 
was achieved through the active participation of the workers in 
a process of large meetings in which [words indistinct] 
participated. 
  TRABAJADORES added: This is how the most difficult part of 
the process began; it is a process that will require the 
people's support and understanding, timely information, a great 
amount of discipline, and rigorous control to implement the 
policies. 
  The newspaper warned it is a long and complex process in 
which other economic, organizational, labor, and wage measures 
must be included. 
  The measures will be adopted amid an iron-clad U.S. economic 
blockade, which has cost the country more than $41 million and 
whose effects, according to several estimates, in 1993 alone, 
prevented the country from obtaining 40 percent of the foreign 
exchange that could have been attained with the same level of 
production and investments, the newspaper noted. 
  The CTC mounthpiece maintained that another adverse factor 
is 
that workers are in dire straits because of the abrupt loss of 
markets and the prices that Cuba was paid for sugar, nickel, 
citric fruits, and other products in the now defunct Soviet 
Union and other socialist European countries. 
  TRABAJADORES explained that the country has to resolve its 
excess cash circulation problems with hardly 23 percent of the 
resources it had four years ago for development. This also has 
to be done without external financial resources, as well as 
within the principles of solidarity and social justice. 
  TRABAJADORES concluded by saying that the Assemblies for 
Economic Efficiency, which are to begin on 16 May, will carry on 
the work begun in the parliaments in the workplace. They will 
prove to be a worthy tool for reducing subsidies and costs, 
applying strict control measures for material resources, and 
systematically contributing to the economy.

  [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- The process of rendering 
accounts to voters -- the backbone of the people's government of 
Cuba -- is currently being carried out on the island, a process 
that will continue through June. 
  Neighborhood assemblies in the different voting precincts 
are 
analyzing the main problems affecting their communities as well 
as the efforts of the delegates who represent them at different 
government levels to solve the problems. 
  These plenary sessions have the power, according to the 
organization and make-up of the people's government and the 
existing laws, to dismiss delegates who, in the people's 
opinion, have not fulfilled their obligations. 
  On this occasion, the assemblies are also debating different 
aspects of the application of the economic measures adopted by 
the parliament in an effort to improve the country's internal 
finances. 
  Regarding the process of rendering accounts, Jaime Crombet, 
vice president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government, said it is being carried out at a very opportune 
moment to wage a political battle, under extremely difficult 
economic conditions, and to advance solutions for local problems 
more effectively.

  [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban sugar industry workers 
intensified their efforts to improve production levels of the 
current sugar harvest and to ensure a good harvest next year. 
  An official report released today announced that Havana 
Province will complete its production plans this Tuesday, thus 
becoming the first to achieve its goals in the country this year. 
  Havana Province leaders also said that they have planted 50 
percent of the lands assigned for next year's harvest and 
surpassed the historic records set for clearing sugar cane 
fields. 
  Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba for the region, emphasized that these achievements were 
attained despite the difficult working conditions resulting from 
the lack of such vital resources as adequate clothing and foot 
ware and despite the cane workers' poor diets. 
  At this stage of the season, sugar workers are 
simultaneously 
doing cutting and grinding work as well as field cleaning and 
planting chores for next year's harvest. 
  Besides the progress achieved in Havana after 150 days of 
the 
harvest season, Ciego de Avila Province, in central Cuba, has 
reported the completion of its planting work. Granma, in the 
east, defied unfavorable weather conditions and set out to grind 
all the cane available. It will soon complete the spring 
planting phase. Rain and residual humidity are, in fact, two 
more obstacles to overcome for those brigades entrenched in the 
battle for higher yields. 
  While reviewing work progress in the field, Sugar Industry 
Minister Nelson Torres praised the determined attitude of the 
sugar workers. He underscored the need to harvest and grind all 
the available sugar cane in order to reach the planned sugar 
production volume. He suggested that the strategy is not to 
loose hope because of the rains and to keep the industry working 
at its potential, while looking at the harvest as a whole and 
doubling efforts. 
  According to reports released by the Sugar Ministry itself, 
the task also includes maintaining the cane planting process at 
the current pace, which is what will guarantee a better harvest 
next year.

  [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche (DYN) -- If you are a 
Peruvian and you want to do business with the cloth dyeing 
method discovered by the Incas centuries ago you can't because 
the process has been patented by US companies, the President of 
the Peruvian national pharmaceutical companies association 
Alvaro Villalobos said yesterday. 
  Speaking at the XV ALIFAR Latin American association of 
pharmaceutical companies meeting being held here, Villalobos 
added that "and if we wanted to use the dyeing techniques we 
should have to pay royalties to these US companies." 
  Another odd story recounted by Villalobos is that the Nazca 
drawings, purported to be messages to the gods, have had a 
patent taken out on them in France and now no products 
containing those drawings can be sold in France. 
  These are just some of the sore points that have cropped up 
at the meeting of Latin American pharmaceutical companies 
discussing the patents issue here. 
  Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador have succumbed to US 
pressure 
and have recently implemented a patents system, Argentina and 
Brazil however continue to show strong resistance to any system 
being imposed on them from abroad. 
  Although CILFA [Argentine Industrial Center of 
Pharmaceutical 
Laboratories], Argentina's local association of companies have 
resisted tooth-and-nail any efforts to impose a patents law, on 
this occasion they will be adopting a more moderate approach and 
unlike some of the extreme views being expressed by other 
delegations, will be seeking to get the other countries to 
accept the GATT's Uruguay Round proposals on the patents issue. 
  The GATT treaty, signed recently by 117 countries proposes a 
transition period of ten years for developing countries and the 
possibility of awarding obligatory licences so as to ward off 
monopoly situations. 
  In Argentina government officials have teamed up with 
senators to try and bring the patents bill currently before the 
Senate, into line with the GATT provisions. 
  Despite the fact that the US signed the GATT Treaty it has 
been attempting to gain further advantages as was the case with 
Brazil where Brazilian President Itamar Franco has promised the 
US that Brazil will eliminate or substantially reduce the 
transition period. 
  However the Brazilian patents bill has still not been 
approved by its Congress. 
  US pressure has also grown considerably on Andean Pact 
countries. 
  Peru has a patents law since January 1, as does Ecuador. 
  Venezuela adopted a law last October while Chile adopted a 
patents law in 1991. 
  However according to the head of the Chilean pharmaceutical 
association Jose Plubins, "the pressure being exerted by the US 
on Chile to change its patents law is becoming unbearable." 
  In Chile's case the US is attempting to extend the life of 
the patent from 15 to 20 years and that patenting should be 
retroactive by five years. 
  Nor does a patents law guarantee foreign investments, as the 
multinationals proclaim. 
  In Chile Pfizer, Bayer, Squibb, Schering and Parke Davies 
have left Chile since the patents law was implemented.

  [Excerpt] On 12 May, Brazilian President Itamar Franco sent 
a letter of welcome to Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz, 
where he reiterated Brazil's admiration and friendship toward 
Cuba. In the letter presented to Castro on 11 May by state 
officials in Salvador, Bahia State, President Itamar Franco 
recalls his meeting with Castro during last year's Third 
Ibero-American Summit and stressed his delight at the prospect 
of meeting again at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit scheduled 
to be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June. 
  In his reply letter, Castro deeply thanked President Franco 
for the warmth of the welcome and pointed out that he and his 
delegation feel at home in the midst of the unsurpassed warmth 
and friendship of the citizens of Bahia. Castro stressed that he 
holds the ineradicable memory of the days spent in that city 
which hosted the Ibero-American Summit and that this is the 
reason it will be a pleasure to greet Franco again in Cartagena 
de Indias. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro arrived in the 
fatherland moments ago. Castro's trip began on 4 May in Barbados 
where he participated in the First Small Island States 
Conference on Sustainable Development. Fidel then traveled to 
Africa to attend [South African] President Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration. On a stopover in Ghana, Castro and his delegation 
met with Ghananian President Jerry Rawlings. In South Africa, 
Fidel met with dozens of people attending the inaugural in 
Pretoria. After the inauguration, Fidel met with Mandela and 
various people to discuss issues of bilateral interest. The next 
stop was Salvador, Brazil, where Castro met with the governor of 
Bahia State. The commander in chief's trip can be described as 
highly productive in view of the expressions of solidarity and 
affection toward Cuba he received at every stop. 
  The delegation accompanying Fidel included Rosa Elena 
Simeon, 
minister of science, technology, and the environment; and 
Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government, and Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina. 
  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro was greeted at Jose Marti 
International Airport by Army General Raul Castro, Politburo 
member Carlos Lage, and [Interior Minister] Abelardo Colome 
Ibarra.

friendly ties of cooperation between Havana and Budapest, which 
many thought long lost in the wake of changes in Eastern Europe, 
can be revitalized and even expanded in the future. 
  This statement was made during a meeting with Cuban 
Ambassador to Hungary Carlos Trejo Sosa. The Hungarian mayor 
added that a visit of his Cuban counterpart to Budapest would 
greatly contribute to establishing real possibilities for 
cooperation between the two cities in the areas of environmental 
protection, transport, and others.

its search for solutions to area problems as soon as they arise. 
Also attending the assembly were administrative officials of 
the units corresponding to this People's Council, who responded 
to the queries of the population as necessary. 
  Jaime Crombet explained that during the current progress 
report process, efforts are being made to avoid monotony, 
formalisms, lengthy reports, and limited participation of the 
constituency -- things that would block the appropriate 
development of these assemblies. 
  [Begin recording] [Crombet] We think that the progress 
report 
process is not merely a delegate meeting with his constituency. 
This is a dynamic, constant, and daily process, as we have seen 
here. This assembly is a summary, a sample of which we can take 
advantage not only to recount what has been done but also to 
project future tasks and promote collective participation in 
solving the problems of the community. This process also permits 
channeling any unresolved problem the community or district may 
have, if it is beyond the realm of the district, to the People's 
Council for resolution. In that case, of course, the delegates 
must take it to the Peoples' Council and then to the 
municipality; some are national level problems. 
  The people know there are many material problems for which 
there are no feasible solutions at this time, such as power 
outages, transportation, food supplies, or medicine supplies. 
There are many problems that are the result of the economic 
situation of the nation, the special period. The people, as we 
have seen here today, know that many problems do have solutions, 
and that some are subjective problems. 
  We need to have those problems brought up and, depending on 
the possibilities and types of problems, to promote solutions 
and the participation of the constituency. We have also 
encouraged taking advantage of these meetings to highlight, 
emphasize, and encourage the main events that have taken place 
in that community. References can be made to international, 
national, provincial, and municipal problems. We believe, 
however, that it is essential that the people know who are the 
best students; if there has been a graduation; whether there is 
a vanguard student; who are the most outstanding combatants; 
whether there are workers in the distriact who are national 
vanguards; who are the best sugarcane cutters; which members of 
the Federation of Cuban Women are going to be delegates to the 
municipal assembly, provincial assembly, or congress. These 
accomplishments of the people should be highlighted. 
  Tonight, we have seen here that the assembly concluded with 
a 
cultural activity, not with artists of national caliber but with 
amateur artists from this People's Council and activities that 
the people enjoy. We also saw the active participation of 
children; they were spontaneous and appealing. This assembly 
moved quickly. There is no need for assemblies to be boring. Not 
all assemblies have to be alike. Each community has its own 
characteristics; cities have their characteristics; country 
towns have other characteristics. We want great diversity, 
dynamism, and participation. 
  We do not want rigid formulas; above all, we want to 
motivate 
the people. We have to stimulate the people so that there will 
be the utmost participation because, in these difficult times of 
the special period, we need the people's backing, their support 
for the Revolution and the measures that must be adopted. This 
is a process of ratification and willingness to make the 
sacrifices needed to preserve the main values for which we are 
fighting: our sovereignty, national independence, the 
accomplishments of socialism, and the preservation of the 
fatherland. 
  It is important, for these to become assemblies of 
revolutionary confirmation. The most important aspect of the 
assemblies, as was confirmed here, is the ratification of the 
willingness of the immense majority of our people to support the 
accords of the ANPP and the measures that, little by little, the 
Council of State will implement. Measures against ill-gotten 
wealth, against hoarders, have already been announced. These 
measures have the massive backing of the people. Measures will 
be implemented, however, that will not be so popular; some of 
the people will not be pleased with those measures. Therefore, 
what we need is for the revolutionary forces at these 
assemblies, those who are more aware of the facts, to explain, 
inform, and clarify things when a portion of our people are not 
fully convinced of the reasons behind each of the decisions to 
be adopted in compliance with the resolution of the special 
session of the ANPP. 
  [Godoy] In this process, the attendance of managers and 
administrators has also been stressed. 
  [Crombet] That is essential, and we have seen that here. 
When 
the main figures of the municipal administration, of the 
entities that work at the Peoples' Council level, are not 
present, many questions go unanswered and then the issues have 
to be relayed to the People's Council or municipal authorities 
by the delegate; thereupon the assemblies lose dynamism, 
efficiency, and effectiveness. 
  This has happened in many places. The manager of the grocery 
store is not present at the assembly; problems relating to the 
grocery store are discussed and the administrator is not 
present. It is essential to the quality of the assemblies that 
the principal figures -- the school principal; the director or 
administrator of the daycare center; the administrator of the 
grocery store, or neighborhood market, or vegetable market; the 
butcher; the local doctor; the main administrative officials -- 
be present. 
  The municipal administrative officials should organize a 
schedule and attend the assemblies so they can actively 
participate. Then, whenever proposals are made, the issues can 
be debated and analyzed and the possible solutions evaluated in 
the assembly. 
  This is the better way. If the problem can be solved or 
clarified at the assembly, that is even better. Sometimes, this 
type of assembly is much more efficient than those where the 
involved parties are not present because then the proposals must 
be left for later and the people are told the outcome 
afterwards. Sometimes the information does not arrive on time or 
at the appropiate time. We have seen how many of the problems 
brought up here were immediately discussed and solutions and 
alternatives found. The process becomes much more dynamic and 
efficient when those responsible for the things the people need 
to solve are present. This has to be scheduled and controlled; 
it is not spontaneous. [end recording]

  [Text] Sources from the Cuban Attorney General's Office 
have announced that conditions have been created to implement 
Decree-Law 149 nationwide by means of which legal action will be 
taken in cases of illegal accumulation of wealth. 
Representatives from the Office of the Attorney General and the 
public administration in every province will move against 
hoarders by seizing their ill-gotten goods while confiscation, 
which will be determined by the Finance and Prices Ministry, is 
in process. 
  This launches a unique and vigorous endeavor that gives 
continuity to the collective efforts of the revolutionary 
process to preserve social discipline. Official sources have 
announced that the population will be informed in a timely 
manner of the fulfillment of this measure.

  [Excerpt] This afternoon at Havana's Granma Memorial, a 
ceremony was held to render homage to internationalist soldiers 
who lost their lives in Africa and whose deeds contributed to 
the South African people's victory in the recent elections. 
  The ceremony was presided over by Army General Raul Castro, 
second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and minister of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who moments before the ceremony 
made exclusive comments for this newscast: 
  [Begin Castro recording] This is the most important event of 
the century, and Mandela -- I was thinking the other day -- is 
the greatest leader of the century. I even dare say the greatest 
leader Africa has had in its long history. 
  As you know, ceremonies such as this are being held in over 
150 mausoleums nationwide as a salute to the death of apartheid; 
the birth of the new South Africa; and to remember our comrades 
whose blood and effort, as leaders of the ANC including Mandela 
have pointed out, were instrumental in reaching 10 May, a day 
such as today. This is a highly moving day for us, a day of deep 
remembrance and immense gratitude toward all our dead comrades. 
Once again, this shows that in a third country -- first Angola, 
then Namibia, and now South Africa -- the effort and the 
bloodshed were not in vain. They conducted the most glorious 
internationalist missions. I say glorious because they were 
probably the most selfless acts in the history of mankind, of a 
people toward their African brothers, a significant limb of our 
national identity. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Youth Labor Army [EJT] has more than 100 
integrated military granges because, since October 1993, many of 
its agricultural units have been raised to this higher system of 
production. 
  Colonel Juan Antonio Hernandez, head of the EJT's political 
section, has reported that more than 40 of these granges are 
located in coffee-producing areas, 32 in sugarcane areas, 8 in 
citrus fruit areas, 6 in tobacco-growing areas, and the 
remainder in other miscellaneous crops and reforestation areas. 
  As an example, Col. Hernandez said that 48 percent of the 
total state production of miscellaneous crops in Havana Province 
is done by the EJT which also participates in other agricultural 
plans in all provinces. Its members, now grouped into these 
integrated granges, have played an outstanding role in dealing 
with citrus trees on the Isle of Youth, which is very large, and 
Matanzas; with sugarcane in Ciego de Avila and Camaguey; and 
with tobacco in Pinar del Rio, where EJT's efficient work has 
considerably helped to reduce student mobilizations from the 
capital to western Cuba. 
  In August of 1993, when the EJT celebrated its 30th 
anniversary, Army General Raul Castro said that with the 
integrated granges, the EJT is climbing to a higher level, which 
must turn it into the most efficient group, upon its assuming 
full responsibility over production activity.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial 
actions in Cuba between 25 April and 9 May. 
  Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 25 April reports that "state 
enterprises have become the principal supply source for the 
black market, not only because they handle the greatest quantity 
of resources but because of their lack of control over the goods 
for which they are responsible. To this we must add that there 
are also authorities so corrupt that they are capable of 
stealing raw materials and merchandise in order to supply the 
underground economy with the sole purpose of enriching 
themselves illegally and enjoying a lifestyle very greatly above 
their real means." The report refers to theft from the Detergent 
and Soap Enterprise, formerly Sabatez, in Cerro Municipality, 
Havana City Province. The Crimes Against the Economy section of 
the Havana City Province Police Operations Unit, upon learning 
that detergent had been unloaded at a residence near the 
enterprise, searched the home of Lazaro Ruiz Cutino, who has a 
criminal record and a history of terrible social conduct, and 
seized 40 sacks of detergent. Four enterprise workers -- a 
warehouse inspector, warehouse chief, and two loader operators 
-- had stolen the detergent through the negligence of the 
production area's brigade chief in transporting the sacks to the 
warehouse. 
  The radio notes: "In certain thefts of merchandise that have 
occurred at state enterprises, police investigators have 
verified participation in crimes on the part of people in 
positions of responsibility, to the sole end of illegally 
increasing their personal wealth." The seven citizens arrested 
had shared 50,000 pesos for the stolen detergent. They will be 
tried for the crime of serious theft. The detergent was 
recovered and the money seized from the defendants was turned 
over to the court. 
  Radio Progreso Network at 1100 GMT on 9 May reports that two 
men were arrested for trying to steal five arrobas of potatoes 
to sell on the black market. The men, Ignacio Andres Gorrero, 
manager of a grocery store that sells agricultural products, and 
Faustino Paz Cabrera, driver of the municipal harvesting 
company, were caught by the police, who recovered a portion of 
the stolen potatoes. The driver had already dropped off over 
five quintals of potatoes at the grocery store in question, to 
be sold by the corrupt administrator at six pesos per pound.

<F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 May (EFE) -- The illegal 
appointment of Emile Jonassaint as Haitian president places the 
Dominican Government in a new, truly uncomfortable position -- a 
vantage point from which it has decided not to meddle in the 
internal affairs of its neighboring country. 
  Today, the Dominican Government distanced itself from 
international criticism of the Haitian coupists for appointing 
Jonassaint as the new Haitian president. The government declared 
this was "an internal matter" and a new twist in a crisis the 
Haitian people must resolve themselves. 
  In statements to EFE, Dominican Foreign Minister Aristides 
Taveras Guzman today said: "We understand the appointment... is 
a move by the Haitian politicians, and, as a country that abides 
by its government's policy, we respect the sovereignty and 
integrity of the people." 
  With the backing of the military that seized power in a 
September 1991 coup, Supreme Court Magistrate Emile Jonassaint 
assumed the presidency of Haiti on Wednesday, drawing criticism 
from the international community and causing fears of armed 
intervention from abroad. 
  Aristides Guzman said: "Although we have endorsed OAS and UN 
efforts to achieve the democratic transition of the (Haitian) 
people, we have always stressed, in one way or another, that the 
Haitians should be the sole protagonists in resolving their 
problems." 
  This position by the Dominican Government, according to what 
Foreign Ministry officials admitted privately, reflects their 
impotence in face of a Haitian crisis that has no good or 
acceptable resolutions from a Dominican standpoint. 
  The Dominican Republic is fated not to agree with but to 
comply with UN and OAS sanctions against the Haitian military -- 
sanctions designed to return deposed President Jean Bertrand 
Aristide to power. The Dominican Republic is hoping the crisis 
will calmly die on its own, preferably by the end of the 
constitutional term of the Haitian government-in-exile, which is 
in February 1995. 
  All current developments in the Haitian crisis are 
threatening the Dominican Republic. 
  Aristide was criticized because of his anti-Dominican 
remarks 
during the seven months he was in power. The military 
government cannot be accepted, however, because of international 
opposition, and the same is true for the illegal appointment of 
Emile Jonaissant. 
  The economic embargo imposed by the United Nations and the 
OAS has not resolved the problem and has discredited the 
Dominican Armed Forces, which have been unable to prevent 
smuggling across the border. The new embargo, which will be 
implemented on 21 May, puts more responsibility on Dominican 
surveillance and will require additional spending. The number 
of Haitian exiles and refugees are increasing in the Dominican 
Republic, while the Dominican Government is resisting pressure 
to install refugee camps near the border. The Dominican 
Republic also has been obliged to accept international 
observers, who will arrive this week to oversee the fulfillment 
of the embargo. 
  All of these problems were outlined to EFE today by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral, who confirmed the 
acceptance of international observers, but he reiterated that 
"the embargo violates the Haitian people's human rights. He 
also said the embargo harms the Dominican Republic in view of 
international accusations of "alleged violations" and by the 
flow of Haitians. 
  Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Government dedicates 
virtually 25 million pesos ($2 million) a month to maintaining 
border security. 
  All of these inconveniences have been heightened in the past 
months by the campaign for the upcoming general elections, which 
will be held this coming Monday in the Dominican Republic. 
  U.S. diplomatic sources, who chose to remain anonymous, 
confirmed to EFE that the Dominican Government "suggested" to 
the United States that it refrain from making "any move" on 
Haiti before the Dominican elections.

<F P=106> [Speech by unofficial Senate Office President Bernard </F>
Sansaricq at the ceremony installing Emile Jonassaint as 
"president" at the Legislative Palace in Port-au-Prince on 11 
May -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the Republic; honorable members of 
the legislature; commander in chief of the Haitian Armed Forces 
and members of the General Staff; representatives of the major 
organizations of the state and churches; men and women of Haiti; 
dear guests; ladies and gentlemen: I have the honor of speaking 
this morning in this august chamber, at the feet of Haiti's 
Declaration of Independence, to give substance to a wish -- 
widely expressed by various sectors -- to see the presidential 
void filled and an end to the governmental fuzziness being 
experienced by the country for several months now. 
  In keeping with our traditions and in compliance with the 
provisions of Article 149 of our Constitution, it is Judge Emile 
Jonassaint, president of the Court of Cassation of the Republic, 
who is vested with the provisional presidency, with the 
corresponding legal consequences. 
  Attorney Jonassaint has courageously and patriotically 
agreed 
to carry out this historic mission -- one of salvation -- for 
the Haitian nation, whose very foundations are threatened. The 
parliament -- in recovered dignity and with the sought-after 
unity -- will accompany him along the path to democracy for the 
salvation of the Haitian people. 
  Today, we are appointing to the State's highest office a 
distinguished figure who represents a number of symbolic values: 
the wisdom of the jurist, the noble fervour of the courageous, 
the calm of the strong, the serenity of the righteous, and a 
nationalism that is total. [applause] 
  Fellow citizens inside and outside Haiti; men, women, 
youths, 
the elderly, and children of Haiti; free peoples throughout the 
world, Never in the tumultuous history of our country have 
Haitians been subjected to ravages as destructive as this weapon 
of war that the economic embargo constitutes. 
  After he was driven out of the sacred temple of 
representative democracy -- where he sought to replace the altar 
of freedoms and constitutional rights with an obscure and 
infamous force devoted to the devil of necklacing and populist 
dictatorship [applause] -- the apostle of hatred and division 
among Haitians, to put the finishing touches on his work of 
destroying the Haitian family and the Haitian nation, addressed 
foreign gods. Today, thanks to the stateless cooperation of 
unnatural sons of our generous nation, international 
infiltration has turned our society into a post-Cold War 
fratricidal battleground, without the slightest consideration of 
the essential needs of our population and in disregard of the 
universal rights of men and of nations. 
  The new international political sphere of influence 
resulting 
from the Cold War -- one of lukewarm peace -- anguishes us 
Haitians, because today, Haiti finds itself imprisoned and 
enslaved in the incredible, indecent U.S. gulag of a 
pseudodemocracy in which the murderous sounds of necklacing and 
machetes mercilessly suppressed the voice of the elected 
representatives of the people, to destroy the nascent Haitian 
democracy's fragile institutions. 
  May God spare all of America this violent and murderous 
pseudodemocracy, one perhaps flourishing in the slum 
neighborhoods of black Americans in the United States and which 
the President of the United States would like to pass on to us 
via a Black Caucus whose noble African memory seems to be 
forever lost. [applause] 
  The international community having voted everything against 
it except for purely and simply removing it from the face of the 
earth, Haiti's very existence as a free and sovereign nation is 
today threatened. They are threatening to use against us 
incendiary bombs, resembling an ocean of flames, to destroy this 
nation whose scrawny body consists of only a few living corpses 
as citizens, in a colonial economy [economie de comptoir] that 
has already given up the ghost. On the thermometer of the 
embargo, one can read -- eloquently -- the high, impoverishing, 
fever that is [word indistinct] our country. 
  What comfort and what glory does the U.S. President intend 
to 
obtain by launching a military attack against this country, 
whose entire resources remain greatly inferior to the 
destructive power of a single Patriot missile? Is not it 
reasonable to believe that the pilots in charge of creating this 
new Hiroshima would have to report to the head of the extremely 
powerful United States that their mission of extermination is 
impossible because they have been preceded by an economic 
embargo that has left Haiti a horrible desert where dead bodies, 
debris, and flies intermingle? [applause]. 
  If such a great American political party is using Haiti in 
order to pay its electoral debt to its supporters, I dare say to 
the world that the trading and bargaining in democracy will not 
be done at the expense of freedom and rights of Haitians to 
self-determination because such a cross would be too heavy; such 
a Calvary too long for our people, who are still thirsting for 
real democracy and economic prosperity. [applause]. 
  I therefore call on the head of Vatican, Holy Father John 
Paul II himself, to work to close this insane chapter in our 
national history by putting back onto the track of morality and 
decency the train of those leaders, traffickers in democracy, to 
whom we entrusted the respect of our sovereignty. 
  We ask the Holy Father himself to exorcize those devils of 
pseudodemocracy issued from the entrails of the venerable 
Catholic Church itself. [applause] We ask the Holy Father 
himself to exorcize those devils of pseudodemocracy issued from 
the entrails of the venerable Catholic Church itself, who would 
like to once more destroy human dignity under the overwhelming 
dictatorship of outdated ideologies. 
  Black people of the entire world, African brothers, see in 
the Haitians' current experience the fate awaiting you tomorrow, 
when the weapons of economic blockade, systematic slander, and 
organized disinformation would be honed in order to serve 
neo-colonialism throughout the world; wake up and say no to the 
current genocide in Haiti. 
  People of Haiti, France has once again led us to the summits 
of the Jura Mountains; Canada sees us only as sardines packed in 
cans; Venezuela has suffered amnesia; and the most powerful 
country on earth, the United States of America, authorizes our 
destruction through the napalm of the embargo, even though the 
entire mythology of American democracy is based -- to quote 
Francois (Manasta) -- on refusing extremes and seeking 
compromise, and on the triumph of good sense. [applause] 
  Glory and honor to former President George Bush, the late 
President Richard Nixon, the honorable Senator Bob Dole, former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the late... [pauses] the 
honorable Sen. (Presler), and all those lovers of freedom, 
democracy, and reason who still believe that in a crisis America 
must place itself behind its friends, not in front of them. 
[applause] 
  In this connection, I call on my country's Army to remain in 
the barracks, respecting the unity of command and the actions of 
the Army hierarchy and ever ready to guarantee public order and 
security. A new page of history more heroic than ever is opening 
up to us, and we are going to write it as much within respect 
for Haitian values as for the values in our Constitution. 
  I urge all citizens to unite, in discipline and 
selflessness, 
to defend the collective interest. Our country is in a weakened 
condition. The time for surrealistic and (?extravagant) 
demagoguery, without cohabitation and power-sharing, is past. 
Let us remain citizens of a free and sovereign nation, around a 
chief, so as together, as Haitians, determine our country's 
democratic future to the benefit of our people, the poorest in 
our hemisphere. [applause] 
  As long as there exists a Haiti, there will be genuine 
Haitians, and as long as there are true Haitians, there will be 
a democratic, prosperous, free, fair, and sovereign Haiti. May 
God protect and help us. Let Haiti be Haiti. [preceding sentence 
in English] As General De Gaulle advise --, wonderfully -- in 
1963: Stop pestering them! [applause] Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In what is some of the first reaction to suspensions 
by the five groups comprising the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front], the People's Revitalizing Expression [ERP] 
described the measure as arbitrary, adding that the suspension 
of Joaquin Villalobos and seven deputies means their expulsion 
from the party. ERP Deputy Juan Ramon Medrano dismissed the 
decision by the FMLN leaders, saying it has no legal validity. 
  [Begin recording] [Medrano] We deplore the decision. Talk of 
suspensions amounts to talking of expulsion. 
  [Reporter Mario Jovel] According to Juan Ramon Medrano, the 
decision by the Communist Party of El Salvador [PCES], PRCT 
[Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers], and the FPL 
[Farabundo Marti Popular Liberation Forces] lacks validity 
because it was made without the total consensus of the FMLN. 
The ERP members said they did not attend Monday's extraordinary 
assembly because the sole purpose was to put them on trial. 
  [Medrano] We call on the other side to not throw a tantrum, 
literally, and to not put us on trial and tell us that they are 
going to punish us for having political differences. Instead, 
they should realize the political reality is different. The war 
ended a few years ago. Society now needs people with a capacity 
for understanding. 
  [Jovel] Medrano indicated there is no unity pact in the FMLN 
because it ended with the war, and, therefore, now there is a 
need for a new understanding. 
  [Medrano] An alliance pact has become necessary since the 
agreements were signed because, since then, we have permanently 
and consistently had these two-against-three divisions. 
  [Jovel] In the opinion of this organization, it is up to the 
other forces within the FMLN to decide whether they will retain 
a party in which the Marxist-Leninist vertical command structure 
prevails, which for the EPR is no longer valid, or whether they 
will make an alliance in which there is respect for the 
democratic principles of all the factions. [end recording] 
  The National Resistance [RN], another of the groups affected 
by the FMLN decision, said the suspension of eight leaders from 
the FMLN Political Commission will heighten the internal crisis 
of that leftist party. According to Eduardo Sancho, RN 
secretary general and former guerrilla, the measure eschews 
internal debate in the FMLN and limits democratic maneuvering 
room to redefine the party's role. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Julian Melendez] The FMLN 
internal debate went beyond the limits of tolerance. On Monday, 
9 May, Eduardo Sancho, one of the FMLN deputies accused of 
treason for taking the post of secretary of the Legislative 
Assembly's Board of Directors, opposed the decision by the FPL, 
PCES, and PRCT to suspend him and six [as heard] other deputies 
from the party leadership. 
  [Sancho] The suspension lacks any legal or political 
validity. We will continue serving as deputies and members of 
the Board of Directors. I believe the FMLN has fallen under the 
control of a very conservative view. 
  [Melendez] Hours earlier, Sancho, accompanied by RN leaders, 
said the FMLN problems are based on its lack of identity, but 
never on disciplinary aspects. In the former guerrilla's 
opinion, what is at stake is the democratization of the FMLN. 
  [Sancho] I believe this is not the way to democratize a 
country. A country is not democratized with those kinds 
disciplinary measures. That is no the way to teach a people who 
must get ready for big debates on the nation's problems. 
  [Melendez] The splintering within the FMLN grows every day, 
but nobody wants to emerge from the crisis as a loser. The five 
leftist parties are betting that they will maintain the 
representation of the party. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Gandhi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Joaquin Villalobos, one of the eight FMLN [Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front] leaders separated from their 
post by the party's national council, said that he will not heed 
the resolution and that he will continue to work as a leader 
because he considers the measure applied by three of the five 
organizations that make up the former guerrilla organization to 
be illegal. 
  The People's Revitalizing Expression, ERP, secretary general 
said that the FMLN's internal crisis does not end with the 
removal of these leaders from the political commission. He even 
mentioned the possibility of legally appealing against the FPL 
[Farabundo Marti Peoples Liberation Forces], the Communist Party 
of El Salvador, and the PRTC [Revolutionary Party of Central 
American Workers]. 
  [Begin Villalobos recording] I belong to the Front as much 
as 
any other person. Just as I said there, with all due respect to 
our comrades, I am a guerrilla just like most of them or even 
more so in the case of many of them. [end recording] 
  That is the position of the ERP's Joaquin Villalobos in the 
face of the FMLN National Council decision to suspend him 
together with seven deputies who are part of his organization as 
well as members of the Armed Forces of National Resistance. 
Villalobos said that both he and his comrades will continue 
their work as party leaders and said that the problem has not 
ended with the resolution adopted by the National Council. 
  [Begin Villalobos recording] They cannot apply that measure, 
which only serves to broaden the framework for the debate. 
There are going to be legal debates, legal measures will be 
taken to counter this, there will be more national political 
debates, and I believe that at the same time arguments within 
each of the organizations will heighten. [end recording] 
  Joaquin Villalobos said the decision to dismiss them is 
loaded with a dose of traditional past Leninist hegemony, which 
to his mind are notions that history is casting aside. The ERP 
leader said that in the long run the PRTC, the FPL, and the 
Communist Party of El Salvador will have to change. 
  [Begin Villalobos recording] I believe we will be seeing 
more 
changes in the next few months, even the change of forces. I am 
not talking about of the ERP or the RN [Armed Forces of National 
Resistance], but the three other organizations; social 
democratic forces will take up center-left positions and agree 
with us in this debate. It is too early to try to interpret 
things. The next thing we will know is that everything is over 
with. I think this is what the more radical members want. [end 
recording] 
  Villalobos admitted that this internal FMLN conflict has 
taken its political toll, but gave assurances that it is only 
temporary.

<F P=106> [News conference by General Humberto Ortega, chief of the </F>
Sandinist People's Army, with unidentified correpondents; place 
not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Ortega] Taking into consideration that Mrs. Violeta 
Barrios de Chamorro, president of the Republic, will send to the 
National Assembly -- as she previously stated -- the bill on the 
new Military Organization Law, I have decided to reveal the 
following document to the nation in the presence of the 
Sandinist People's Army [EPS] chain of command. 
  So Nicaraguans, particularly the leading players in the 
national political life, may better understand the issue of 
civilian and military relations under the current circumstances 
which prevail in Nicaragua, I consider it necessary --before all 
else -- to review in an overall way certain important issues 
[two-minute break in reception] civilian-military 
(?dictatorship) to exercise its domination over the Nicaraguan 
people. It is undeniable that relations among Nicaraguan people 
were quite deteriorated at the time. It is, therefore, 
difficult to talk about adequate civilian and military relations 
at that time in our history, above all, when a power like the 
United States, the biggest power at the time, clearly supported 
the dictatorship that oppressed the majority of Nicaraguans and 
prevented the exercise of true democracy in Nicaragua. 
  Since the assassination of General August Cesar Sandino in 
1934, and until 19 July 1979, civilian and military relations 
earned the rejection of Nicaraguan civilian society given the 
domination exercised by and through the Somozist National Guard. 
As a result of President Anastasio Somoza's downfall, a 
transition process toward democracy began in Nicaragua and we 
must recognize that the course of its consolidation was 
reasserted and clearly marked despite all the difficulties. The 
revolution established the groundwork that granted the 
opportunities to exercise the rights Nicaragua now has. 
  Without that revolution we would not be celebrating the 
current administration's fourth anniversary or the historical 
changes that it generated, and local political groups would not 
be participating in the broad Nicaraguan political debate 
without restrictions or threats. Quite the contrary, the debate 
is held with a tolerance that frequently clashes with the 
nation's constitutional and legal framework. That is something 
else, however, because the important thing in any case is to 
guarantee the liberty and democracy for which our people have 
struggled since the last century. 
  Between 1979 and the February 1990 elections, civilian and 
military relations in our country were marked by the U.S. 
enforcement of an unfair policy that financed a war and imposed 
an economic blockade that immersed Nicaragua in the most abject 
poverty. It was precisely this erroneous U.S. policy that was 
condemned by the highest International Court of Justice at The 
Hague and the policy that U.S. President William Clinton is now 
trying to leave behind so we may begin the new century with a 
new type of relation based on the principle of mutual respect. 
  The end of an alliance between different groups of the 
Nicaraguan society who united to defeat the Somozist 
dictatorship through the first government junta of national 
reconstruction; a radicalization of the revolution given U.S. 
aggression; and an increasing political polarization among 
Nicaraguans represent some of the main elements that prevented 
an adequate relationship among Nicaraguans within the search for 
a much-sought democratic system in the historical chapter that 
was written during the last decade. 
  Peace is essential to the consolidation of the democratic 
system we are building. I would like to remind you of the 
efforts of our brothers: in Latin America, the Contadora Group; 
in Central America, the Esquipulas Agreements; and in Nicaragua, 
the Sandinists and counterrevolutionaries in Sapoa, who 
established fundamental factors to achieve the strategic defeat 
of foreign aggression. 
  I must tell you that the strategic defeat of the Reagan plan 
was but the revolution's military triumph, without which for 
example, instead of a Sandinist military command today we would 
have a Somozist command or the counterrevolution of past years. 
  Within the framework of the Sapoa Agreements and the Central 
American agreements, however, President Violeta Barrios 
decidedly and assertively culminated this peace effort, which 
definitely buried the war, opened a chapter of national 
reconciliation, and created a broader climate of political 
freedoms which today, despite many difficulties, all Nicaraguans 
are enjoying and are obliged to protect. 
  Although the reactionaries failed to impose the Army they 
wanted, it is no less true that Nicaragua was destroyed by a 
foreign debt of approximately $12 billion, largely due to the 
war, which will take us a long time to settle. These are a few 
of the basic elements that explain the backwardness we are 
experiencing today, added to which are the mistaken policies 
which, according to analysts, were implemented by the previous 
government. 
  Another important element was the 1990 elections. You must 
understand that it was a victory that was quite far from being a 
peaceful and rancor-free process. Precisely in response to this 
political polarization, it was a highly polarized and vengeful 
electoral victory. In March 1990, a transition agreement was 
signed by the revolution and the government-elect. This 
agreement prevented Nicaragua from entering a course of chaos 
and anarchy that would lead to another civil war which, 
unquestionably, would have been bloodier than the previous one. 
  At that time, it would have been very difficult to view 
civilian-military relations in the light which we are beginning 
to view them now. Nicaragua is currently in the process of 
legitimizing the Army despite those people who still believe it 
is possible to alter the course of this historic trend in 
Nicaragua. We cannot ignore the fact that some people cannot or 
do not want to understand that to change this situation in any 
way would be to set Nicaragua, once again, on the path to the 
profoundest instability. 
  Therefore, the Army's legitimacy should be the gradual 
result 
of a broad consensus and its maturity should be the result of 
the efforts by all forces of the nation to ensure that the Army 
truly is a national Army that represents all Nicaraguans. 
  It must be understood that the Army is no longer the 
expression of a political party, the Sandinist Front, as it was 
in the past. It is no longer such a thing, and it is also 
imperative to admit that it will not be the armed wing of any 
political party or a certain class or an economic sector. 
  It is precisely because of this failure to acknowledge 
these new circumstances that even some economic analysts have 
made serious mistakes. One of them recently pointed out that 
Nicaragua's problem was the Army because it has sought to block 
the government's economic program at any cost. I am convinced 
that a country's economic and social problem must not be 
perceived from a repressive point of view. Much less must one 
adhere to the reasoning that in order to implement a specific 
plan, be it neoliberal or not, it is first necessary to crush 
the people's protest by force. 
  In Nicaragua, the Army [word indistinct] to ensure peace. We 
have been able to remove more than 130,000 assorted weapons from 
circulation. These weapons were in the hands of Sandinists and 
non-Sandinist civilians. Obviously, these weapons created a 
situation of risk and insecurity for the entire population. In 
addition, no one can deny that we have responsibly concluded the 
reduction process despite the fact that none of the Central 
American armies adopted the regional reduction and safety plan 
proposed by the Nicaraguan Government. These plans were 
unquestionably supported by our Army. 
  Most of all, I would like to clearly point out, especially 
to 
those friends who are willing to help us, that Nicaragua's main 
problem is not between civilians and the military leaders. The 
main problem afflicting us in Nicaragua is poverty, economic 
backwardness, and the underdevelopment of a nation that lacks 
democratic experience and urgently needs a solid material basis 
in order to advance toward a truly democratic culture. 
  From another perspective, the main problem lies with those 
of 
us who want democracy and those who are against it. It is not 
between military and civilian leaders. Just as during the past 
administration, the Army has been respectful of every political, 
economic, diplomatic, financial, and social activity carried out 
by the current administration. This has been the case 
regardless of whether or not some sectors may have described 
these activities as good or bad, or whether or not these sectors 
were right or wrong. This Army has never interfered in any of 
the decisions adopted by this government in exercising its 
rights which were won in the 1990 elections. We have never 
interfered in the National Assembly. 
  We have never gone to parliament to impose any particular 
political line. We have never gone to the Supreme Court of 
Justice to tell magistrates how justice must be imparted or to 
point out to them the problems of the legal or judicial system, 
a system criticized by various sectors of society that want a 
true de jure state and solemn respect for human rights, 
something that is necessary to consolidate the democratic 
process while having economic progress and social justice. 
  The Army has never kept the electoral authorities from 
fulfilling the law. On the contrary, during the 1990 elections 
process, for example, hundreds of brother soldiers and officers 
died while fighting the last offensives that the reactionaries 
launched from Honduran territory to try to frustrate the 
election process to justify the warmongering policy they wanted 
to impose on President George Bush after the Reagan plan failed. 
  Hundreds of brothers died fulfilling their duty, securing 
the 
necessary public order for carrying out those elections, which 
served as a unique example for America and perhaps for the whole 
world, the example of a revolution that wins power the armed way 
and surrenders it peacefully and democratically showing respect 
for the will of the people as expressed at the polls. 
  We have not interfered with the Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise or with labor unions, or with other important 
Nicaraguan sectors. 
  I believe that civilian-military relations have notably 
improved in the past four years in spite of difficulties and 
people who may not be aware of this fact yet. The EPS has been 
an stabilizing factor. Without the Army, Nicaragua would live 
in chaos, instability, and total anarchy. 
  To those who say the Army should not exist, I say that if 
the 
Army were to disappear today, tomorrow various armed groups 
would appear claiming to represent the various antagonistic and 
polarized political forces that still have excluding stands in 
the country's political and economic fields. 
  I want to mention our perspectives for the immediate future. 
Nicaragua is still experiencing a polarized situation. There 
are sectors that believe that democracy can be achieved only if 
the historic changes that were made here as a result of the 
revolution are erased. 
  There are others who think that democracy has to be based 
only on the revolutionary past, which was necessary at a given 
moment, but which now is behind us. 
  These are essential contradictions that must be overcome to 
reach basic national unity. To achieve this, it is necessary to 
objectively take into account the correlation of forces, the 
real strength of the sectors in contradiction. 
  I will mention some of the important elements necessary to 
reach this goal: 
  Reforms to the Constitution -- It is necessary to reach a 
basic political agreement that is based on the correlation of 
forces in the country. The Constitution must be our fundamental 
framework in the future. Nicaragua must have a constitutional 
regime with clear laws to which all of us must be subordinate. 
  The Constitution of 1987, born in the framework of the 
Revolution, has kept us on track, out of chaos. 
  This Constitution, however, is no longer effective and must 
be amended. 
  Property -- This is a very important issue, closely linked 
to 
the titanic efforts that Nicaragua must earnestly make to try to 
solve the dilemma of poverty. In clear judicial and political 
agreements on the issue of property pertaining to beneficiaries 
as well as to claimants, quite rightly, we will hardly reach the 
much needed stability to begin implementing and consolidating a 
plan, regardless of its political and ideological orientation, 
because there will be no reference points even for domestic 
consumption efforts or for the much needed foreign investment to 
make the country prosper. 
  National crusade against violence -- This is another vital 
issue because although the war was left behind as a political 
expression to alter the correlation among existing efforts, 
social decadence, and violence in its many forms, violence will 
completely undermine and destroy the Nicaraguan State we want to 
have and need to modernize. From our viewpoint, it is 
imperative to face violence with a spirit of national crusade to 
ensure that protected by the laws and with ample civilian 
support, we will reinforce the order and safety of mainly 
producers, peasants, townsfolk, and tradesmen, who are the 
constant victims of gangs of street criminals and wrongdoers. 
  Minimum consensus to face the socioeconomic crisis -- This 
is 
a general issue. The government recently joined the ESAF 
[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility], which in fact, the 
current administration has already recognized and is addressing. 
To that effect, I believe the important thing to do is to find 
the way to overcome those hard times and tough policies carried 
out to fashion harsh realities into positive results. I think 
the country's stability to expand production and to make the 
economy thrive must be the main result, ensuring that every 
sacrifice imposed on the people due to those very painful 
economic policies must benefit not only a minority; they must 
also benefit the middle and poorest classes of this country. 
  We are convinced it is difficult, almost impossible, to 
jointly solve those economic and social problems that are 
present in every situation. I also believe, however, it is 
essential to make efforts to at least help ease the dramatic 
effects that these measures have on society. 
  Finally, I wish to say it is equally vital for the executive 
branch, the Army, and the National Assembly to reach a clear, 
conscientious, and enthusiastic consensus on the Military 
Organization Law. The subordination and respect that the Army 
has shown to civilian power amid all difficulties must be 
clearly stated in the juridical and legal order. 
  This law is 
essential to guarantee we will now have a small Army that 
adequately fulfills our society's needs and to support the 
process for the Army's professionalization. The legal mechanisms 
to achieve a rapprochement between civilian and military power 
should be clearly established. It is not a matter of 
establishing, as some people want, a law that dismantles the 
Army to leave it diminished and humiliated. These are, among 
other things, the issues I consider vital and necessary to 
settle in Nicaragua now so we may build the democratic system we 
all hope for. It is clear that Nicaragua is involved in a new 
democratic process and we all have the right to participate in 
the process, regardless of each one's political ideology. I 
want to state today that the Army will fulfill its role in the 
construction of this democratic regime we need so much. We will 
now answer questions. 
  [Correspondent] Excuse us for repeating the question we 
asked 
you yesterday. It deals with a meeting of high-ranking Army 
commanders, National Assembly deputies, and the government 
minister. Following the meeting, one of the participants told 
BARRICADA your retirement was scheduled for 21 February 1995. We 
would all like to know when this will happen. We are waiting 
for an official statement on such an important issue. 
  [Ortega] The most important thing here is that we have been 
working in a dedicated, serious manner with various groups -- in 
this case the National Assembly, the executive branch, and the 
Army. The most important thing is that we are reaching a 
consensus on what we so dearly need in Nicaragua concerning many 
contradictory issues. In other words, considerable progress has 
been achieved, compared to previous months, when our views were 
not so similar. 
  It is true that meetings have been held to seek a consensus 
on the Military Law. This will enable us to concentrate on the 
great historical step, when the country will have, for the first 
time, a law that will enable Nicaragua to quickly and safely 
consolidate a national Army. That is the most important thing. 
Within the framework of this project, which has been carried 
out constructively, we have managed to overcome some differences 
we had since 2 December -- between the executive branch and the 
Army, and between myself and President Violeta Barrios [name as 
heard]. 
  I think we should be happy about this. I think every 
agreement, every constructive step should encourage us to 
support them. That is why I said the most important thing at 
this point is to have a satisfactory agreement concerning the 
law, which is the most important issue because it will give 
Nicaragua more juridical and legal guarantees for the Army. 
There is also a satisfactory, correct, and adequate agreement 
concerning the retirement of the current EPS chief, Humberto 
Ortega. This is the most important thing. Referring to the day 
that we intend to make an announcement about the bill that will 
be sent to the National Assembly and about myself, as chief of 
the EPS, this will happen soon. 
  I believe it will be sometime next week. I do not want to 
say anything ahead of time because I would be jumping ahead of 
something that must follow normal procedures. I do believe, 
however, the most important issue is that there is an agreement, 
and that we work in a more mature and responsible manner which 
is more in line with national interests and not any other type 
of interests. Basically, once we have approved all the details 
and have made it public, the 2 September situation will have 
been overcome. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] Most likely it will be made public sometime next 
week. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] [words indistinct] The day and date are secondary. 
The important issue here is that we have been working more than 
two years for an adequate, responsible, and modern law. We can 
even say this is going to be one of the most modern laws 
approved during the past years in Latin America. Most of all, 
it draws the civilian and military branch closer together in a 
modern and constructive manner. In addition, the most important 
issue is that the military will be subordinated to the civilian 
branch. 
  [Correspondent] Gen. Ortega, [words indistinct] your entire 
high command if there is really nothing new? 
  [Ortega] Well, I believe that the most important issue is 
that we have ratified decisions of principle for this Army in 
light of the situation in the country. When you go over it, you 
will notice that there are issues that are worthwhile [words 
indistinct]. Every day there are going to be those alarmists or 
headlines grabbers who simply want to satisfy the media. The 
most important point here is that we are demonstrating what the 
Army's historical process is all about. We are also 
demonstrating what the civilian-military relation is about 
because we are about to enter a [words indistinct]. Once the 
law arrives before the assembly, I am quite sure there will be 
much debate surrounding it. What we have done is to provide 
people with a general framework of our outlook with respect to 
the civilian-military relationship so that when discussions 
surrounding the law takes place, the people will know how we 
think. This bill is very important to us because it expresses 
our position and our conviction. 
  [Correspondent] You have always spoken about [words 
indistinct] as relates to the military law [words indistinct] 
and the differences. Yet, you have never specified what these 
differences with the executive branch are. Why not explain 
[words indistinct]. Why not ratify once and for all [words 
indistinct], and I reiterate my question with respect to the 
differences. 
  [Ortega] Yes, of course. The differences have been related 
to the lack of a civilian-military relationship. We have slowly 
been discussing and understanding one another on issues such as 
subordination -- for instance, how it should be -- and on the 
authority, functions, and kind of fundamental structure the Army 
must have. On the matter of the Army's jurisdiction, we made 
major progress on some [word indistinct] the civilian sector 
had. In sum, [words indistinct] the law will be announced. I 
think this will happen no later than next week, as I have been 
in touch with the Presidency. Next week, within the appropriate 
framework, the matters dealing with my retirement as Army Chief 
will be announced. Both issues will take place soon, maybe by 
next week. 
  [Correspondent] I understand the Army High Command is 
responsible for recommending your successor as Army Chief to the 
President of the Republic. Since expectations have been growing 
about your retirement, the name of Major General Joaquin Cuadra 
has been mentioned constantly. First of all, I would like to 
know if you can confirm if Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra is the only 
candidate to occupy the position. Secondly, if you say that 
your retirement is secondary and not the main issue, then why 
wait until the last minute? 
  [Ortega] Mainly because we have to respect several 
procedures 
we have agreed upon. I do not want [words indistinct] things 
which we have already agreed on, the procedures of how we would 
go about it. With respect to the mechanisms used in the Army, 
in addition to obeying the law, we have an obligation to the 
hierarchy within the institution. In addition, we have an 
obligation to evaluate merits since the triumph of the 
revolution as well as during the revolution. Throughout these 
difficult times the Army was called upon to play a key role 
[words indistinct] of Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra. Therefore, as 
[words indistinct] we have no inconvenience. In due time, we 
plan to formalize it in the military council. As I said, we can 
find no inconveniences to that type of [word indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] General, Joaquin Cuadra is the principal 
candidate to replace you? 
  [Ortega] That is correct. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] In general terms, We say the Army does not 
interfere 
in the country's normal civilian life. What happens is that 
there are very extremist sectors that still talk about 
eliminating the Army or turning it into an insignificant body. 
  We have not come to discuss that. We have not come to accept 
that kind of message but to discuss matters of interest. We 
simply want to retake [words indistinct]. We want to correctly 
focus on [two-second break in reception] alter the current 
correlation. There are people who believe the Army should 
disappear. Those who advocate that policy are creating 
instability. 
  Work has been made toward a consensus. Important forces in 
the assembly, such as the [words indistinct], should be there 
once the bill gets there to have a richer and more productive 
debate. Let us hope that deputies from other currents see the 
good points of this bill for the nation, and do not look at me 
antagonistically. This is the idea. 
  We do not interfere with COSEP [Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise]. We do not carry out any activity that goes against 
the Nicaraguan private enterprise and we have never considered 
that kind of policy. So far we have not done it. 
  [Correspondent] General, will this be a law or a military 
code? 
  [Ortega] It is a code because it contains several laws. This 
will be a code of military urbanization, jurisdiction, and 
social assistance. That is going to be its title. 
  [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] did you present the 
candidate or [words indistinct]? 
  [Ortega] This is something that will not meet great 
difficulties [words indistinct] due to the [words indistinct] we 
have. The succession in the EPS is therefore very clear. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] was held a seminar on 
civilian-military relations. Some proposals or recommendations 
were presented on the need to create a defense ministry in 
Nicaragua. Would the EPS agree to create a defense ministry? 
Could you comment if this has a [12-second break in reception] 
  [Ortega] ...in that event, this has been analyzed 
thoroughly. 
The problem is those who would have to take over these tasks 
are not currently prepared. These people would have to be 
prepared and educated so they can understand and contribute, in 
this case, to the military-government relationship. I believe 
this problem [words indistinct] when everything is ready, then 
action can be taken through presidential decision to create a 
defense ministry. I believe this [words indistinct] causes 
delays. But we have no [word indistinct]. On the contrary, we 
believe that a defense ministry would harmonize a series of 
political tasks, of national defense, coordination, that through 
the state, the military and the government should carry out. 
  Currently, the state is being reduced. When there is 
unemployment, when people from the government sector are being 
left unemployed, it would be absurd to propose the creation of a 
bureaucratic mechanism right now. I believe it would go against 
ESAF policies. Perhaps, later on, when the [word indistinct] 
has been tested with another government, better solutions might 
be available. 
  [Correspondent] What guarantees [words indistinct] the Army 
[words indistinct] on the part of parliamentary factions and the 
National Assembly will be given to guarantee the implementation 
of [words indistinct] will be continued. [Words indistinct] 
have committed, at least in a general framework. Second, I would 
like to know what you have planned after your retirement [words 
indistinct], any electoral plans vis-a-vis the 1996 elections? 
  [Ortega] It has been scheduled for the 21st and was chosen 
in 
accordance with [words indistinct]. This is a very significant 
date for the party. 
  [Correspondent] Will you devote yourself to business or 
politics? 
  [Ortega] We are positive that [words indistinct] will be the 
economic development [words indistinct]. 
  We really do not want to be tied to anything. We are 
certain of this proposal. When we use logic, even though it may 
not be understood at the very beginning, it naturally comes out 
during the debate. We have great trust in this. We believe this 
is quite fair and that it will be understood. 
  As for the 21 February thing [words indistinct] we are quite 
sure that next week it will be made known in a proper manner. 
As for myself, I do not have to look for something to do. I 
am a revolutionary. I will continue to be a revolutionary. I 
am a man concerned about the fate of Nicaragua and I will try to 
contribute as much as I can, including in the historic judicial 
case. We are committed to a task that has not been finished 
yet. It is a task that all Nicaraguans must continue to work on. 
  I do not have to look for something to do. I am here doing 
my patriotic work in the Army. I am contributing by giving the 
country a national Army that is purged, that is not involved in 
politics, and that fundamentally responds to the Constitution 
and the law. It is not a repressive force that is at the 
service as we said in the document. [sentence as heard] That is 
why it is good to remember history. The Army is not at the 
service of any class or political party. It is an army that is 
really at the service of all Nicaraguans. Therefore, I do not 
have to look for something to do. I am doing my work now, and I 
am going to do this work in the future. 
  [Correspondent] Have you ruled out any participation in the 
next election campaign? 
  [Ortega] Up until now, no one has asked me to be a 
candidate. 
If you asked me to be a candidate, we would think about it. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] The problem the Nicaraguan people have is that we 
are all immersed in the search for clear-cut distinctiveness in 
one way or the other. Forces of all types in the country are 
facing divisions. If you observe the country's situation, you 
are going to find there are divisions and problems everywhere. 
I believe the unity of the Nicaraguan people is vital. I 
believe we have to look for a way out of the crisis. We must 
find a nationalist solution for all Nicaraguans regardless of 
their race, religion, or political affiliation. This is vital 
in saving Nicaragua. That is what I could tell you in this 
regard. I really do not want to get involved in the internal 
problems of the Sandinist National Liberation Front. I believe 
that all Nicaraguans must unite around a program to save 
Nicaragua. We said this in the document we released today. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] What is important here is not my departure. Rather, 
the important issue here is the law. This is what we are giving 
Nicaragua. I have not heard the statements made by the 
president, but we had already agreed on how to announce this 
kind of thing. I want to honor that commitment. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] No, no I have not heard anything. I do not know if 
she said that. We had agreed to make a joint announcement. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] 
  [Ortega] Yesterday, we met with [word indistinct] and with 
the cardinal, and you all witnessed this. There, we talked 
about the need to make great efforts to convince the people to 
help the authorities face this problem. Actually, the [word 
indistinct] are increased in various parts of the country. The 
efforts we are making in the Army, the police, and in other 
organizations in the cities is to prevent this phenomenon from 
spreading to the cities. We want to build a type of barrier to 
prevent this evil from becoming somewhat common here as well. 
This thing would be awful for the country's image and for the 
tranquility of the country's citizens. We are going to start 
working against the problems of extortion, kidnappings, and 
robberies in the countryside, and we want to say that, in spite 
of everything, the results of the past three months have been 
quite positive, and we believe the results will be even more 
positive. 
  [Correspondent] Gen. Ortega, [words indistinct] one of the 
most important points said society [words indistinct] U.S. 
Congress approved a law some people view as an ultimatum for 
Nicaragua. And the association of people whose property has 
been confiscated stated several of its properties are in the 
hands of Army military officers. Will the Army cooperate in 
trying to resolve this problem by returning some of these 
properties? 
  [Ortega] We have been working within the framework of law 
and 
order to resolve, once and for all, the property issue. We have 
provided all the assistance required. We think this is a 
problem, not only for those whose properties were arbitrarily 
and unjustly confiscated, but we believe it is a fundamental 
problem for a majority of Nicaraguan citizens who benefited from 
the law, within the framework of a very complex revolution. 
This has generated a misunderstanding. 
  We must adhere to the law and ethics, as well as our deeper 
moral commitments and conduct. We have never accepted the 
abuses [words indistinct] of the law to benefit some people, 
which was granted by the revolution in the last few months of 
its mandate. We never supported this and we have always 
expected [words indistinct] pinata-like giveaway. But no list 
has ever been presented on who profited from the pinata-like 
giveaway so that they may be brought to justice. I was reading 
in a newspaper that there are even Sandinists who know about 
fellow Sandinists who illegally occupied properties. They 
should be brought to court. To say that the pinata-like 
giveaway occurred and not to say who they are would be like 
covering up criminals. 
  We believe there were cases in which the law was violated 
and 
there was corruption. We have always agreed these cases must be 
uncovered. We never had these problems in the Army. We always 
clearly stated our position to the executive. We asked if it 
had any complaint against the Army, and there was none. There 
are cases of homes which belonged to U.S. citizens and we are 
trying to find a solution to that. This will not be done in a 
hasty manner. Thank you. 
  [Announcer] This has been the message to the nation and news 
conference by Gen. Humberto Ortega.

  [Text] Panama City, 12 May (ACAN-EFE) -- President 
Guillermo Endara plans to attend the fourth Ibero-American 
summit, scheduled to take place next month in Colombia, 
accompanied by his successor, Ernesto Perez Balladares, winner 
of last Sunday's presidential elections. Endara, who today 
installed the government transition commission with his 
successor, will be traveling on 14 and 15 June to Cartagena de 
Indias to his last meeting of presidents and heads of state. 
The government transition is scheduled to take place on 1 
September. 
  Perez Balladares, who confirmed that he will be traveling 
with Endara and Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis 
Galindo, abstained from commenting on Panama's position during 
the fourth Ibero-American summit since he "respects the 
direction" followed by the current administration. 
  Lewis Galindo said that the president-elect will try to 
recover the international prestige Panama earned during General 
Omar Torrijos' (1968-1981) era. He added that the Panamanian 
Foreign Ministry will do its utmost to attain readmission into 
the Rio Group from which it was excluded as a result of the 
crisis caused in 1988 by former Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
currently imprisoned in Miami (United States) on drug 
trafficking charges. 
  This June, Endara's successor plans to undertake a hectic 
international initiative that will take him to the Middle East, 
Costa Rica, and Colombia aimed at strengthening Panama's 
international relations. 
  When asked by ACAN-EFE about the main guidelines of his 
foreign policy, Perez Balladares indicated that he plans to 
create the necessary mechanisms to ensure the definite transfer 
of the inter-oceanic canal by the United States on 31 December 
1999, as stipulated by the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty. The 
treaty signed by Torrijos and Former President Jimmy Carter 
establishes that the United States will transfer the canal and 
dozens of military bases distributed along the country's 80-km 
length to Panama's jurisdiction on a date no later than the last 
day of this century. The president-elect acknowledges that 
during the first years of his administration his main objective 
will be to prepare everything for the Panamanians to efficiently 
take control of the canal. 
  In addition, he intends to ensure Panama's inclusion in 
NAFTA.

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez; from the "RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez has 
agreed to remain in his post and work in the government of Dr. 
Ernesto Perez Balladares. 
  President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, upon his arrival 
for a meeting with the National Police director, said he will 
not yet officially announce who will make up his cabinet, but 
said he will seek the desired national consensus. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] There is a positive 
atmosphere to achieve a consensus, which all Panamanians want 
and for which, I understand, the Panamanian people voted. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could this attempt at a consensus 
lead to some problems within the Democratic Revolutionary Party 
[PRD]? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, our party will be very well 
represented in the cabinet and in all government posts because 
it is also the party that obtained the most votes. The party 
has the political maturity to understand that to achieve a 
consensus it is necessary to allow other forces to participate, 
otherwise there will not be a consensus. We cannot speak of 
good intentions only. We have to put them into practice. [end 
recording] 
  The meeting, which was held in the office of National Police 
Director Oswaldo Fernandez, lasted over two hours. Some of 
Perez Balladares' top advisers participated. 
  As he was leaving, the Panamanian president-elect broke the 
tight security to greet the personnel working in this public 
security institution. 
  National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez said the meeting 
with the president-elect was to brief him on the Public Force, 
its organization, and the future support for this institution by 
the new government. Fernandez also talked about Perez 
Balladares' offer to have him remain as the institution's 
director. Fernandez said he accepted after President Guillermo 
Endara also asked him to stay. 
  [Begin recording] [Fernandez] We decided to remain here. As 
I told your colleagues a moment ago, it was not an easy decision 
for an attorney who had already been nominated for a post in the 
Supreme Court. 
  [Reporter] What motivated you to stay? 
  [Fernandez] The primary reason was that both the incoming 
and 
outgoing presidents asked me to stay. In addition, I have also 
received requests from many people in the National Police, 
especially policemen, sergeants, and corporals, who asked me to 
stay with the institution. If both presidents thought I should 
remain as director, it was not because I was the best but 
because of the work accomplished by the National Police. The 
work has been carried out thanks to those people, who asked me 
to stay with them. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 12 
May. 
  The National Statistics Institute reported that mining 
production improved in the year's first quarter as a result of 
gold exploitation that increased 113 percent. It rose 9.4 
percent in March, an increase of four points compared with the 
previous two months. Mining exports increased by 17.7 percent. 
(Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 1 May 94 National Section p 2) 
  National Industry Chamber President Gary Lacunza expressed 
his concern to President Sanchez de Lozada over the drop in the 
GDP growth rate between 1991 and 1993. He reported that from a 
growth rate of 7.2 percent in 1991, it dropped to 3.37 percent 
in 1992 and reached no more than a 1.08 percent increase in GDP 
in 1993. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 1 May 94 National 
Section p 1) 
  During his recent visit to Germany, Foreign Minister Antonio 
Aranibar Quiroga obtained a $30 million credit that will be used 
to implement several projects in Santa Cruz, Oruro, and Beni 
Departments. The Bolivian Foreign Ministry reported that German 
cooperation totalled $380 million in the 1989-1993 period. 
(Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 3 May 94 p A6) 
  The Spanish Government granted an $85 million loan to 
Bolivia 
during a visit to Spain by Economic Development Minister 
Fernando Cossio and Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar. (La Paz 
PRESENCIA in Spanish 4 May 94 p 12) 
  The INE reported that the April inflation rate was 0.49 
percent and that the cumulative inflation rate was 1.79 percent 
in the year's first four months. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 4 May 94 
Economic Section p 17) 
  The foreign debt totalled $3.788 billion through 31 December 
1993, of which $2.1 billion are owed to multinational 
organizations and $1.62 billion to bilateral institutions. The 
Inter-American Development Bank is the main multilateral 
creditor, with $1.223 billion, while Japan is its main bilateral 
creditor with $507 million. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 5 May 94

  [Text] With a decision that caught most government 
officials by surprise, President Carlos Menem yesterday decided 
to group the Federal Police, the Coast Guard, and the Border 
Police, that is, the entire state security apparatus, under a 
future Secretariat for State Security. Menem chose Julian 
Licastro, a retired Army lieutenant with a long career within 
the Peronist party, to head this supersecretariat (it might also 
include management of the Secretariat for State Intelligence, 
SIDE). 
  In designing the new secretariat's structure Menem did not 
seem to realize some details: The future secretariat undermines 
the powers of the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry. 
  When the news had already spread outside the presidential 
office, the government was forced to issue a press communique in 
an attempt to calm the debate prompted by the proposal. 
  Some government officials attributed this initiative to 
[Economics Minister] Domingo Cavallo's team. One of Cavallo's 
team members even told CLARIN that on 8 May Licastro met the 
economics minister. In an attempt to explain Cavallo's alleged 
meddling in this issue, the source noted: "The management of 
roughly $2.6 billion that is spent on security is involved." 
  The official communique was issued late after the reports 
had 
already astonished SIDE, Defense Ministry, and Interior Ministry 
officials. SIDE, the Defense Ministry, and the Interior 
Ministry had been dealing with pieces of rumors, prompting an 
atmosphere of bewilderment and irritation. This atmosphere 
spread to the security forces involved. 
  To soothe the uproar, but raising more questions, the press 
communique's first paragraph notes: "As it is necessary to 
achieve an effective coordination among the various security 
forces involved in the protection of public property and in the 
struggle against crime and drug trafficking, the president of 
the nation has given instructions to the interior and defense 
ministers to study the formation of a State Secretariat for 
Interior Security. 
<H5>  Social Violence </H5>
  Nevertheless, the communique did not manage to clear other 
doubts: Would the Drug Enforcement Secretariat, headed by 
Alberto Lestelle, also be included in the same package? Will 
SIDE, as had initially been indicated, be included or not? Will 
this be the organization to command the rapid deployment units 
that are being planned to repress social disorders that 
overwhelm the provincial police? It seemed that no one at 
Government House last night had any response to these issues. 
  The official communique's belated caution, with 
announcements 
such as "to study the formation of" or "to plan the new 
organization's operational structure," was prompted after those 
covered by the Interior Security Law at their fingertips went to 
the Government House to caution about the legal and political 
challenges that will undoubtedly be raised by various circles, 
including the security forces themselves. 
  This issue will be discussed during a cabinet meeting at the 
Olivos presidential residence. Menem's proposal seeks to group 
military units, intelligence activities, and drug enforcement 
forces under a single head. This disagrees with the spirit and 
provisions of a law agreed upon between Peronists and Radicals, 
who also make up a bicameral monitoring committee that was also 
not consulted before taking this step. 
  Nevertheless, an official involved in drawing up legal 
standards and decrees assured CLARIN that a presidential decree 
alone would be required to establish the new secretariat. This 
official, however, emphasized that such a presidential decree 
has not yet been drawn up, and that Licastro has not yet been 
appointed as secretary. 
  The source actually noted that in order to establish a 
secretariat of such characteristics, the Interior Ministry's 
Undersecretariat, headed by Hugo Franco would be dissolved and 
at least the status of SIDE would be changed.

  [Text] The Army was merely summoned to act jointly with the 
Federal Police [PF] in a move to guarantee the freedom of 
transit. At present, the situation is normal throughout the 
country with the exception of three capitals. The cabinet chief 
of the PF Department in Brasilia guarantees that the situation 
has returned to normal. 
  On 11 May, Jose Roberto da Silva, the cabinet chief of 
Colonel Wilson Romao who is the Federal Police director general, 
reported that except for Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and Belem [Para 
State], 30 percent of PF administrative personnel are working 
normally in the other states. Da Silva added that the issuance 
of passports is normal nationwide and borders are under control. 
  He explained that the Army was summoned to guarantee the 
right to move freely of those civil servants who wanted to work. 
Col. Romao personally requested the Army to step in after PF 
strikers, who have been out for 54 days, prevented civil 
servants from entering the Federal Police Department building on 
10 and 11 May. 
  Yet, the Army personnel were summoned to Brasilia in the 
early hours of 11 May by express order of President Itamar 
Franco. They cordoned off the PF headquarters and were deployed 
in other places of the city, including the Ministries Esplanade. 
Army personnel were supported by four helicopters of the Army 
Special Brigades stationed in Rio de Janeiro. Da Silva said the 
Army personnel will continue to be deployed in Brasilia, Belem, 
and Sao Paulo until the end of the strike. 
  Col. Romao was to have held a news conference early this 
morning, but declined to talk to the press. The Army 
Communications Center reported that only the PF and Planalto 
Palace will inform the public about the latest developments in 
this issue.

  [Text] Passport issuance at the Federal Police building in 
Sao Paulo has returned to normal, yet Army soldiers are still 
guarding Federal Police buildings. The street on which the Sao 
Paulo Federal Police Superintendency is located remains closed 
to traffic. Some 50 Army troops armed with rifles have cordoned 
off the sidewalks. No one has been allowed to pass without 
declaring his destination. 
  Today, passport issuance returned to normal. Delegates and 
officials of the Federal Police administrative area are serving 
the public. Some 1,500 passports are expected to be issued 
today. 
  This morning, federal policemen held a meeting and decided 
to 
reject a federal government proposal to maintain 30 percent of 
policemen at work. The matter was not even voted on by the 
policemen.

  [Text] Brasilia, 11 May (EFE) -- Official sources reported 
here today that the Brazilian Government will ask Mexico for 
compensation for possible losses our country may sustain as a 
result of the tariff benefits Mexico will be granting to its 
NAFTA partners, the United States and Canada. 
  The Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) has 
decided that Mexico should compensate any of its 10 ALADI 
partners whose exports may be hurt by NAFTA. By compensating 
them, Mexico will be exempted from the ALADI requirement of 
sharing the benefits it may obtain through NAFTA with the other 
ALADI members. 
  To obtain a waiver for this requirement, Mexico will have to 
negotiate compensations with those ALADI members whose exports 
to Mexico may be hurt by NAFTA. 
  Arthur Denot Medeiros is the Brazilian Foreign Ministry 
under 
secretary for integration, economic affairs, and foreign trade. 
He said: "Waivers will be conditioned to compensatory 
negotiations." Denot added that this solution will contribute 
to preserving ALADI, "which has been institutionally weakened" 
since Mexico joined NAFTA.

  [Text] Today, President Itamar Franco met with Romanian 
Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu in the main hall of Planalto 
Palace. After attending a military parade, they discussed trade 
and economic relations between the two countries. 
  Brazilian-Romanian trade last year stood at $38 million. 
Brazil exports iron ore, instant coffee, and soybean bran to 
Romania; and it imports transformers, roller bearings, and 
railroad ties. 
  According to Itamaraty advisers, negotiations are under way 
for Brazilian companies to participate in the modernization of 
Romanian highway, railway, and telecommunications systems. 
  After their meeting, Franco and Vacaroiu had lunch at 
Itamaraty. In his welcome speech, Franco said the political and 
economic changes that had taken place in Romania will pave the 
way for strengthening economic and political relations between 
the two countries.

  [Text] Landless farmer groups have invaded public buildings 
and created huge confusion in the traffic in four state 
capitals. In Pernambuco, they caused a traffic jam and occupied 
the INCRA [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute] 
headquarters in Recife. The invaders want the government to 
accelerate the expropriation of farms in the interior of the 
state. The INCRA regional superintendent blamed the delay on 
bureaucracy. 
  In Fortaleza, Ceara State, 400 invaders have been occupying 
the Legislative Assembly since last night. Police are 
preventing other demonstrators from entering the building. The 
demonstrators demand the payment of emergency front salaries 
which are due. They have not received their salaries for 45 
days. The payment must be made by the federal government. 
After meeting Governor Ciro Gomes, the invaders decided to 
leave the Legislative Assembly late in the afternoon. The 
governor promised to do his best to ensure payment of the 
overdue salaries and to convince the government to increase the 
emergency front salaries. 
  In Maceio, Alagoas State, the invaders have been in the 
Finance Ministry offices since 9 May. It was decided in a 
meeting that on 16 May they will receive seeds and basic 
foodstuff baskets, but the invaders decided to remain in the 
offices until the seeds and food are delivered. 
  On the third day of demonstrations in Porto Alegre, the 
landless farmers marched along downtown streets and caused huge 
traffic jams. They walked up to the government palace and tried 
to meet with Governor Alceu Collares. They want land for 
settlements, credits for small farmers, and a meeting with the 
finance minister. The striking invaders even barred the finance 
minister's entrance to the Finance Ministry. Here is Alexandre 
Garcia's report: 
  [Begin Garcia recording] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero 
has 
been the victim of two incidents that could have had serious 
consequences if it had not been for his common sense. 
  The first incident occurred during a class he was teaching 
at 
Brasilia University, where he has been teaching for the last 24 
years. Strikers invaded the classroom carrying a coffin and CUT 
[Sole Workers Center] flags. The professor suspended the class 
and walked toward his car in the parking lot. He was followed 
by the strikers, who were threatening the professor and minister. 
  The second incident occurred after lunch yesterday, when he 
was returning to the Finance Ministry and found the entrance 
door blocked by members of the Landless Farmers Movement who 
were carrying CUT flags. He turned around and went to his 
Planalto Palace office. 
  The finance minister reported on these incidents a few 
minutes ago. He said the incidents seemed to have been 
coordinated so as to be conducted throughout the country as a 
political strike against the economic plan. He pointed out that 
even the CUT national treasurer had admitted that. As an 
example, he mentioned that the offices of the Finance Ministry 
in four capitals have been simultaneously invaded. He added 
that these methods are not democratic. [end recording] 
  We will now report on reactions to the strikes and the 
invasion of public buildings nationwide: 
  [Begin recording] [Deputy Miro Teixeira; Democratic Labor 
Party, Rio de Janeiro] I do not believe, for example, that to 
maintain a minister inside his ministry's facilities, as if he 
were in a private prison, can benefit strikers. These incidents, 
however, may have been carried out by an agitator infiltrated 
into the movement. 
  [Deputy Artur da Tavola; Brazilian Social Democracy Party 
leader] The PT [Workers Party] radical sector wants to unite the 
people around the excuse of the salary demand. The most 
reasonable PT sectors are hurriedly trying to extinguish this 
fire, but it has already given birth to the dragon that is now 
giving orders. 
  [Deputy Chico Vigilante; PT deputy leader] These strikes 
have 
no political objective whatsoever. These strikes have economic 
reasons: The workers are demanding regaining their salaries' 
purchasing power. 
  [Senator Marco Maciel; Liberal Front Party leader] As the 
strikes seek to destabilize the economic plan, they will result 
not only in political and electoral harm, but will also harm the 
country itself. 
  [Jair Meneghelli; CUT president] These strikes logically 
help, as they enable workers to obtain compensation for losses 
resulting from the Fernando Henrique Cardoso plan. 
  [Enilson Simoes de Moura; Union Force secretary] The recent 
strikes have clearly caused large electoral losses. There is a 
clear movement aimed at giving social consistency to Lula and PT 
criticism of the economic plan currently in force in the 
country. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Paulo Sotero] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- Yesterday, PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva said he 
supports, in principle, the idea of "using a multinational 
military force to restore democracy in Haiti." He said the coup 
d'etat against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was "as grave" 
as Saddam Husayn's invasion of Kuwait. In what was apparently a 
veiled criticism of U.S. inaction in the case of Haiti, Lula 
said he does not agree with "the policy of double weights and 
double measurements." 
  These were Lula's first meaningful statements on foreign 
policy during his trip to the United States. Lula proposed the 
creation of "more agile mechanisms" to respond to attacks 
against the democratic order in Latin America. He criticized 
the proposal to create a permanent military force under the OAS 
to protect the region's democratic regimes, however. He said 
that under a PT administration, Brazil will not attempt to take 
a leadership role "on this specific question." Brazil will 
participate with other countries of the region in initiatives 
and actions that respect the principle of self-determination. 
  During a luncheon with U.S. legislators, and afterwards 
during a public audience at the U.S. Congress, Lula 
diplomatically criticized the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba 
right in front of the measure's main supporter in Congress, New 
Jersey Democratic Representative Roberto Torricelli. Torricelli 
heads a House of Representatives foreign relations subcommittee, 
and was Lula's host on the occasion. "The embargo is against 
President Fidel Castro. It is not fair because the Cuban people 
suffer the consequences," Lula said. "I do not understand an 
initiative that has the purpose of protecting human rights in 
Cuba, but which leaves innocent Cuban children without food and 
medicines." Lula expressed hope that the U.S. Government would 
put aside its lasting animosity toward Cuba. He mentioned the 
agreement between Israel and the PLO as an example of an 
attitude that deserves to be followed. "Eight months ago, I 
visited Israel and met with the Israeli prime minister. At that 
time, a peace agreement with the Palestinians seemed impossible, 
but today the agreement is a reality." 
  The third day of Lula's tour of the United States was also 
marked by moderation. On 10 May, he spoke before nearly 300 
sympathizers who crowded a large amphitheater at Harvard 
University Law School. On the occasion, Lula and main economic 
adviser Aloizio Mercadante set aside the carefulness they had 
exhibited during their meetings with entrepreneurs. Sitting in 
front of them were some 50 Brazilians who study at Harvard. But 
most of those attending the meeting were young descendants of 
the tens of thousands of Brazilians who live in Boston's 
surroundings. 
  But Lula regained the moderate tones that had characterized 
his meetings with bankers and New York business executives 
during his public and private meetings in Washington yesterday. 
Lula added a new line to the discussions on the foreign debt, 
an unavoidable topic at all meetings. He reiterated that if he 
is elected president he will not try to renegotiate the debt, 
"which has already been approved by the Senate. Some people find 
it difficult to accept the PT's disagreement with present debt 
agreements, which is very interesting, and the fact that we want 
to talk about it with creditors. These people do not react in 
the same way when the Dart family, whose members have $1.4 
billion in Brazilian foreign debt titles, threaten to sue 
Brazil." 
  Lula said during his meeting at the U.S. Congress that he 
will accept international financial and technological 
cooperation to design a sustainable development policy for the 
Amazon region "within a framework of absolute respect for our 
national sovereignty." 
  Lula visited the THE WASHINGTON POST headquarters, where he 
was received by honorary president Katherine Graham. He also 
had an unscheduled meeting with Jim Hackney, Department of 
Commerce under secretary for Latin America [title as published], 
who promised to arrange a meeting with Secretary of Commerce 
Ronald Brown when he visits Brazil at the end of the month. 
Lula's agenda today will begin with a breakfast with Richard 
Feinberg, National Security Council adviser for Latin America 
[title as published], and will end in New York with a reception 
at the residence of Ronaldo Sardemberg, Brazilian ambassador to 
the United Nations. 
  Tomorrow, Lula will test his knowledge of economic issues at 
a forum with experts organized by Inter-American Dialogue. He 
will not have the help of Mercadante, who returned to Brasilia 
yesterday to participate in the vote on the process to strip 
Deputy Ricardo Fiuza of his privileges. Lula's visit to the 
United States will end tomorrow with a luncheon for nearly 700 
people at the Hotel Marriott Marquis on Broadway.

  [Excerpt] Pernambuco Deputy Ricardo Fiuza, against whom 
charges were made by the CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] that delved into the budget scandal, was acquitted by 
a plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies on the evening of 
11 May. 
  The request for his removal from office, which was 
recommended by the Budget CPI, had already been rejected by the 
Constitution and Justice Committee but it had to be voted by the 
House plenum. It was voted down 208 votes for, 232 against, 
with 15 abstentions. 
  The Chamber of Deputies thus acquitted Deputy Fiuza, who was 
accused of being implicated in the Budget mafia. To have him 
dismissed, the request had to be carried by 252 votes. 
  Few deputies commented on this vote at the end of the 
sitting. Deputy Fiuza, former social welfare minister and former 
leader of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], heaved a sigh of relief 
upon learning the result. He said he will retire from public 
life. 
  [Begin Fiuza recording] I did not resign and I answered 
everything. I am now in a position to say that I will no longer 
stand as candidate for anything. I will retire from public life. 
I am the first victim of the fascist repression in Brazil. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 12 May. 
  In 1993, Brazilian industrial productivity grew by a record 
18.78 percent with respect to 1992, when it grew 4.86 percent 
with respect to 1991. This information was released on 5 May by 
Yolanda Ramalho, chief of the Economic Department of the 
National Bank for Economic and Social Development. Ramalho 
explained that the productivity rise caused unemployment to grow 
1.7 percent among industry workers, while the dollar value of 
salaries paid in 1993 grew 10.88 percent. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO 
DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 6 May 94 p B4) 
  During the first quarter of 1994, Brazilian electric power 
consumption grew 2.8 percent with respect to the same period in 
1993. This growth rate did not reach the expected 4 percent 
rate that had been estimated by Eletrobras' [Brazilian Electric 
Power Company, Inc.] market department. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 5 May p 14) 
  The April inflation rate measured by Getulio Vargas 
Foundation totaled 42.46 percent. It was 2.3 points lower than 
the March rate. The Agricultural Wholesale Price Index in April 
totalled 36.88 percent, almost 12 percent less than in March. 
Industrial prices remained stable, decreasing from 42.06 
percent in March to 41.90 percent in April. Compared to March, 
retail sales prices, however, increased 2.1 points in April, 
ending at 45.57 percent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 10 May 94 p 3) 
  The level of employment in Sao Paulo industries fell 0.26 
percent in April, with 5,792 industrial workers being dismissed. 
(Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 May 94 p 10) 
  The profile of the Brazilian trade balance in the first 
quarter of 1994 shows that imports in general increased. 
Capital goods imports increased 41.5 percent and totalled $2.35 
billion, while consumption goods imports increased 29.8 percent 
and totalled $645 million. Brazilian exports from January to 
March reached their second best level in the country's history, 
totalling $8.8 billion. Brazilian exports to the PRC, however, 
decreased 67 percent during the quarter, totalling only $98.2 
million. Brazilian sales to Latin American Integration 
Association member countries, except Argentina, dropped 6.74 
percent, showing that the developing countries, which always 
supported Brazilian sales abroad, are responsible for a 91 
percent drop in overall Brazilian exports. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 May 94 pp 1, 3)

<F P=106> [Article by Sao Jose dos Campos correspondent Virginia </F>
Silveira] 
  [Text] Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc., a 
company that specializes in developing military defense 
materiel, is investing in an expansion of its civilian products 
business, which still represents only 30 percent of annual 
sales. Last month, the company concluded two technological 
cooperation agreements for development of mobile satellite 
communications systems and optoelectronics components used in 
optical communications. 
  The first agreement, signed with Embratel [Brazilian 
Telecommunications Company, Inc.] and Simac Systems, a Dutch 
company, calls for distribution of the Logiq system in Brazil. 
That system is used to manage fleets of vehicles via Inmarsat 
satellites, owned by an international consortium of which 
Embratel is a member. Avibras, according to its vice president 
Rubens Domingues Porto, will supply the complete system, 
including installation, training, and technical assistance. 
  The Logiq system, Porto said, will permit a user to locate 
and track his fleet automatically, to plan routes, give 
instructions and directions, and exchange information between 
each vehicle and the user's company. "Communications can be 
exchanged 24 hours a day," the vice president emphasized. 
<H5>  Optoelectronics </H5>
  Through its Fiber Optics and Telecommunications unit, 
Avibras 
will also manufacture optoelectronics components (lasers, 
optical receptors, amplifiers, etc). The project is being 
carried out with technical support from Telebras [Brazilian 
Telecommunications, Inc.] and Hewlett-Packard's Components for 
Fiber Optics Division. The firm, according to Porto, will 
initially supply submodules for assembly and encapsulation of 
the devices in Brazil. 
  The partnership agreement with Hewlett-Packard, the Avibras 
official said, will permit nationalization of the production and 
exclusive distribution of the components in Brazil and the rest 
of South America. 
  Avibras Fiber Optics is also preparing to enter the fiber 
optics market within the next 12 months. "We are finishing work 
on the facilities for the unit, in which $6 million has already 
been invested," he reported. 
  Before it can begin operating, Porto said, the fiber optics 
will need another $4 million, which would be used to import 
equipment. The company predicts an annual market for 100,000 to 
150,000 kilometers of fiber optics in Brazil. 
  The new Avibras factory will make fiber optics by the MCVD 
(Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, using technology 
developed by Telebras's Research and Development Center (CPqD) 
and support from S.G. Control, a British firm.

<F P=106> [Article by Sao Jose dos Campos correspondent Virginia </F>
Silveira] 
  [Text] Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc., a war 
materiel manufacturer, showed a net profit of $21.2 million for 
1993. This result, although positive, was not considered 
significant for the company. "The inflation-induced profit, 
which looks good, is fictitious and was caused by distortions in 
Brazilian monetary legislation," said Avibras Vice President 
Rubens Domingues Porto. 
  Last year the company's net profit was larger--about $22.9 
million. In reality, as Porto said, the figures on the balance 
sheet show that the company, although still operating under 
Chapter 11, has been able to pay its bills and still maintain a 
reasonable level of sales. Avibras's net operating profit in 
1993 was $122.5 million, down 9.2 percent from 1992. 
  The drop in revenues, according to Porto, still reflects the 
reduction in the number of military contracts, which account for 
70 percent of company sales. The crisis at Avibras began in 
1987, with the end of the Iran-Iraq war and the suspension of 
payments by Iraq for units of the Astros-2 saturation rocket 
launching system. In January 1990, when the company filed for 
Chapter 11, its debts were estimated at $458 million. 
<H5>  Debts Paid </H5>
  According to the company vice president, the debts under the 
Chapter 11 proceedings were paid off in January 1992 when the 
company deposited the second installment on the debt. The 
Chapter 11 restrictions have not been lifted, however. "Some 
suppliers were not satisfied with the amounts we deposited," 
Porto said. 
  During the Chapter 11 process, overall company indebtedness 
declined. "For the past four years, we have been unable to take 
out any bank loans or buy anything on the installment plan," he 
explained. In 1993, company indebtedness fell from 47 percent to 
38.5 percent. Short-term debts, according to Porto, amount to 
about $43 million. Once the country's leading exporter of 
armaments, with net sales of $390 million during the 1980's, 
Avibras now survives by selling products to the civilian sector 
and filling small technical assistance contracts, and supplying 
parts and spares under old Astros-2 rockets systems contracts. 
  The firm's latest sale of war materiel, according to its 
vice 
president, was to Angola, last year. "We sold the Angolan army 
Sbat 70 air-to-ground rocket systems--rockets fired from 
aircraft," he commented. He said the contract was worth $3 
million. 
<H5>  Selling Services </H5>
  Taking advantage of the advanced technology it developed 
through the manufacture of military products, Avibras is selling 
products and services in the fields of computer technology, 
chemistry, and telecommunications. The company's computer 
technology unit, set up last year, sold about $100,000 worth of 
386 and 486 PC's, diskettes, and videotapes. The 
telecommunications division has been successful in selling 
satellite communications systems. 
  The fiber optics unit that is now being installed has 
already 
received investments on the order of $6 million. The company 
estimates the market for fiber optics in Brazil at between 
100,000 to 150,000 kilometers annually. The sector that used to 
make rocket fuel and explosives has been reoriented to make 
waterproofing compounds for the construction industry and 
chemical products for parts molding.

  [Text] Yesterday, President Cesar Gaviria gave a number of 
instructions to the country's mayors, governors, policemen, 
police detectives, and the administrative institutions that deal 
with public order. 
  In a directive defining the guidelines for national 
strategies against violence, the Security Advisory Board listed 
nine [as published] fronts of action to fight common delinquency 
and organized crime. 
<H5>  Anti-Violence </H5>
  The National Police, the Defense Ministry, and security 
organizations, under the coordination of the Prosecutor 
General's Office, must create and support the Specialized 
Homicide Brigades to be deployed in the most critical regions to 
promote gun control. 
  The Armed Forces will toughen their fight against subversion 
by training their staff and broadening their operational 
capacity by means of carrying out other actions to attack the 
financial sources of the subversion and the groups that embrace 
private justice and common delinquency. 
  In short, according to the directive, the DAS 
[Administrative 
Department of Security] will coordinate with the Prosecutor 
General's Office, the Finance Ministry, the Bank of the 
Republic, and the National Superintendency of Banks on the 
development of specific plans to curtail money laundering, 
irregular money inflows, and illegal enrichment. 
  In due time, the government will promote campaigns asking 
citizens to help eradicate kidnappings. Meanwhile, the Defense 
Ministry will adjust budget guidelines to improve the 
performance of the Unase [Antiextortion and Kidnapping Unit]. 
<H5>  Justice </H5>
  The directive goes on. Mayors and governors must give 
priority to developing local security plans, which must be 
submitted to the National Security Council before 30 June. 
These officials must also prepare the Justice Development Plan, 
update the infringement system [regimen de contravenciones], 
promote the mechanisms for out-of-court conflict settlements, 
and cooperate in the consolidation of the Prosecutor General's 
Office and the legal system. 
  Meanwhile, the National Penitentiary and Prison Institute 
must expedite the construction of six new prison centers and 
bolster the maximum security wings. 
<H5>  Police Force </H5>
  The Defense Ministry must increase the presence of policemen 
nationwide. The goal is to increase the number of professional 
soldiers by 10,000 in two years and to create two new mobile 
brigades. 
  Likewise, within a month, the National Police must champion 
the Career Statutes and conduct evaluations of the agenda of the 
Immediate Attention Centers (CAI) to improve their performance. 
The National Police commissioner, meanwhile, must restructure 
within two months the procedures to respond to the complaints of 
citizens. 
<H5>  Intelligence </H5>
  According to the new presidential directive, the Defense 
Ministry must strengthen the channels of coordination among 
security agencies and upgrade communications systems to ensure 
that all intelligence organizations are linked within three 
years. 
  Policemen, the DAS, and the Prosecutor General's Office must 
prepare a counterintelligence program to avert subversion and 
drug trafficking infiltrations and to prevent internal 
corruption within the State's security corps. 
<H5>  Peace and Reintegration </H5>
  Those guerrilla groups that show a resolute willingness to 
rejoin civilian life will benefit from reintegration plans that 
include judicial and sociopolitical guarantees, as well as 
security guarantees. 
  Only the president, through the Peace Counseling Board and 
the National Rehabilitarion Plan, will hold talks and 
negotiations with those groups who accept preestablished 
conditions. 
  President Gaviria reaffirmed the validity of the 
reintegration plans for guerrillas to rejoin civilian life and 
said that mayors and governors will actively participate in the 
implementation of these plans to guarantee that the commitments 
included in the political agreements of each department will be 
honored. 
<H5>  Options for Youths </H5>
  The Education Ministry, with the help of the private sector, 
will persist in promoting efforts to achieve the expansion of 
high school education through the creation of 600,000 new high 
school openings by 1995. 
  The Labor Ministry, with the help of governors, mayors, and 
the Presidency, will promote the development of local, national, 
and regional programs to offer counseling, orientation, and 
training to potential entrepreneurs and job-seeking youths. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  The presidency will continue to promote programs to defend 
human rights and democracy by conducting civic education 
campaigns to respect rights and their mechanisms of protection.

    [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish at 1230 GMT on 11 May, as part of its "0600 
to 0900 Newscast," broadcasts a live 60-minute interview with 
Colombian Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper 
Pizano by unidentified reporters at the Caracol studios in Santa 
Fe de Bogota. The interview is moderated by Caracol News 
Director Dario Arizmendi. 
  Before the interview gets under way, Arizmendi notes that 
the 
newscast was supposed to host a "debate" between Samper and 
Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana on the 
topics of "peace and drug trafficking," but he adds that 
Pastrana opted not to attend. Arizmendi does not give any 
reason for Pastrana's failure to attend, other than to say that 
after being invited to the debate, Pastrana sent a letter "to 
various media directors, proposing a list of topics, the radio 
and television newscasts to be visited, the duration of each 
debate, and so on." Arizmendi adds that the day before, 10 May, 
Pastrana's campaign manager "could not say whether Dr. Andres 
Pastrana could come to Caracol at this time in the morning." 
  The interview begins with Liberal Party Candidate Ernesto 
Samper Pizano replying to a question about the economic and 
political cost of peace with the guerrilla forces operating in 
Colombia: "The day we evaluate what violence costs the country, 
we will then realize that peace is very cheap." Samper agrees 
there is a "need for peace management" because a great many 
logistical issues are involved, such as where will the former 
guerrillas live, how will they earn a living, and what will be 
done with their property. Samper adds, "Already, many 
guerrillas are involved in organized crime." 
  Samper then stresses the need to "support peace through the 
business sector," noting that as development minister, he 
arranged some very interesting meetings with businessmen with 
this goal in mind. 
  In replying to another question, Samper says guerrillas 
should be guaranteed minimum subsistence. He continues by 
saying "everything else" is negotiable, adding that the 
government is the one to set conditions and that the 
negotiations must be brief. He adds that it is necessary to 
draw out the bottom-line conditions required by both the 
government and the guerrillas before the two sides sit down to 
negotiate. 
  On the topic of when the peace process should begin, Samper 
says: "No deadline should be set, but the process should begin 
the day after the president is chosen -- and I hope it is me -- 
on 30 May." 
  The topic then shifts to kidnapping, which one reporter 
describes "as intimately linked to subversion," and he asks 
Samper how his government intends to deal with this problem. 
Samper replies that he has supported the work of the Free 
Country Foundation, adding, "we need more legal regulatory 
guidelines." He continues: "We must have security organizations 
that must be committed to relatives of kidnapping victims in 
order to rescue the victims and return them to safety." 
  On the subject of the two basic guerrilla proposals -- 1) 
land reform and greater assistance for peasants, as demanded by 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia; and 2) a 
nationalistic oil policy, as demanded by the Army of National 
Liberation -- Samper is asked: "To what degree would your 
government be willing to give in?" 
  Samper says the problem with agrarian reform is that 
"everything has been left half done; about 1 million hectares 
still need to be distributed." 
  He adds that Colombia has long-standing oil legislation, 
adding: "I do not think it is a good idea to change the rules of 
the game for oil investors overnight. Adjustments can be made, 
as has recently been the case, so that the amount of royalties 
are not only proportionate to the size of the well, but in 
accordance with the well's productivity. Therefore, a higher 
producing well will earn more money for the government. 
Nevertheless, in no case whatsoever would I establish laws that 
disregard the rights of investors." 
  In terms of land reform, Samper says: "The law also outlines 
certain ways to capitalize the agriculture and cattle-raising 
sector. There are many aspects of agrarian reform that 
specifically deal with land issues. Therefore, there is no 
reason for me to disagree with you that we, of course, need to 
return the Agrarian Savings Bank to the peasants and to give all 
workers in the farm sector new and improved living conditions." 
  Returning to the subject of dialogue with the guerrillas, 
Samper says he would entrust the work "to a high commissioner 
who would have the specific task of establishing all contacts, 
not only with the guerrillas, but also with civilian society, to 
create an atmosphere of peace." Asked whether peace is his top 
priority, Samper replies: "Peace must come hand in hand with 
security. For the common man on the street, aside from not 
being mugged, peace may very well mean also having job 
opportunities." He adds: "This peace must also be achieved 
within an overall security process, which means improving the 
security conditions under which many Colombians now live." 
  The subject then turns to the recent Constitutional Court 
decision to decriminalize the so-called "personal dose" of 
drugs, and Samper is asked whether he agrees with the 
government's position of waiting for the full text of the ruling 
to be published "next week" before announcing its final 
position. Samper says: "Yes, but we must also understand that 
the debate is not just a legal one, but also a political and 
social debate because the simple decriminalization announcement 
for personal doses of drugs could begin turning countless 
sinister wheels in the drug underworld, which would encourage 
the selling of drugs for personal use to youths at rock-bottom 
prices." 
  Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper 
continues by saying he has changed his views on the legalization 
of drugs because "when I proposed legalizing drugs 15 years ago, 
the drug business only involved a few peasants who grew 
marijuana in Santa Marta's Sierra Neveda. At the time, I said: 
Let us buy out their drug production; let us give them the 
ability to change their crops, and this will allow us to get out 
from under the power of drugs. No one took any notice, and we 
then went from marijuana to coca, from coca to cocaine, and then 
came drug trafficking, and from drug trafficking we went to 
narcoterrorism. Obviously, conditions today make legalization 
totally unviable. It is not that I have changed my position. 
Instead, the circumstances have changed over the past 15 years, 
and this is why right now I have spoken out against 
decriminalization because people might get the idea that this is 
some sort of pardon for everything that has taken place over the 
past 15 years. 
  "There are, however, very respectable people who continue to 
work on the legalization idea, for example, Dr. Alvaro Gomez 
Hurtado, who currently supports Dr. Andres Pastrana. Gomez has 
not been heard recently on any of these topics. It would be 
good to know whether he shares the opinions of Dr. Pastrana on 
this point, or whether he insists on his legalization idea." 
  Samper is asked whether the government should negotiate with 
the remaining drug cartels, as well as "how should these drug 
traffickers be confronted?" Samper says he is "a fanatic 
believer that drug traffickers should be prosecuted under the 
law. If the prison terms have to be reviewed, fine. If 
term-reduction mechanisms need to be separated to prevent the 
two mechanisms from running in parallel, then this should be 
done. I fully agree that an immediate review should be 
instituted. We cannot deny Colombians the right that those who 
break the law receive a fair trial and a safe jail to serve 
their time. This is basically what the surrender policy is all 
about. I will therefore continue to support this policy because 
I believe we cannot wait for the United States to reduce 
consumption or wait for Germany to halt the trafficking of 
chemical precursors to resolve the drug problem." 
  The discussion then turns to Colombian coffee policy, and 
Samper is asked, if he were presidet now, what instructions he 
would give to Finance and Public Credit Minister Rudolf Hommes 
regarding a hike in coffee prices. Samper replies: "The current 
domestic price for a pound of coffee is approximately 85 cents, 
while international prices have already reached $1.25. 
Therefore, a 5-percent increase would only translate to four 
cents, which seems very low to me. I believe we need to go much 
higher. I do not want to mention a figure to avoid being called 
a populist." 
  Samper adds: "Even if Dr. Pastrana does not like it, coffee 
growers have a right to receive a good portion of the prices 
fetched on the international market. The rest can be set aside 
for a stabilization fund to cover sluggish periods. It seems to 
be completely senseless to argue that coffee prices should be 
frozen to control inflation. Coffee growers, like any other 
sector of the economy, have the right to benefit from market 
opening. That is why I maintain, as part of my coffee doctrine, 
that we need to free coffee from state macroeconomic 
supervision. Why should the government reach into the pockets 
of coffee growers each time it needs to reduce inflation? No, 
if the economy is to be open, then it should be open for 
everyone." 
  After Arizmendi urges Samper to give specific examples 
concerning his coffee policy, Samper replies he would propose 
two hikes in coffee prices -- "one right away, between 10-15 
percent, and I would leave an adjustment that they will likely 
seek from me in September pending." Samper adds: "I prefer to 
increase coffee prices rather than to adopt Pastrana's proposal 
to forgive the debt. Forgiving the coffee producers' debt seems 
to me extremely dangerous. If we begin pardoning debts, as Dr. 
Pastrana proposes, can you imagine the financial system's 
collapse?"

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
29 May 1994. 
  A recent poll conducted in 25 cities nationwide between 22 
and 26 April by the National Center shows Liberal Party 
presidential candidate Ernesto Samper leading Conservative Party 
candidate Andres Pastrana by 7 percent. In the case of a 
run-off election, Samper will reportedly beat out Pastrana by 53 
percent for Samper to 44 percent for Pastrana. During the 
closing of the Governors' Summit, candidate Pastrana stressed 
that the state cannot forget its responsibilities for the health 
of its citizens, and added that the tax base and revenue sources 
for the various departments must be broadened. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1 May 94 p 9A) 
  Pastrana's campaign-coordinator Luis Moreno has indicated 
Pastrana has always been willing to hold debates. Conservative 
vice presidential candidate Luis Ramirez said the latest polls 
indicate Pastrana is on the rise, people are very enthusiastic 
about Pastrana's campaign. He adds that, regardless of polls, 
they have always welcomed debates. Antonio Navarro Wolff, 
candidate for the 19 April Movement, noted that Samper's 
indecision regarding his participation in debates is worrisome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] Minister of Justice Andres Gonzalez Diaz strongly 
and skillfully defended the new CPP [Criminal Procedures Code], 
which has been sharply criticized in the United States because 
it apparently deals very gently with drug traffickers. 
  Gonzalez said that in the three months it has been in 
effect, 
this Code has not yet had time to demonstrate all its benefits: 
"Among others, it has put an end to the automatic benefits 
criminals used to get." 
  In an interview with EL TIEMPO he also said that the 
excessive legal benefits drug traffickers receive come from old 
laws, most of which were abolished by the new Criminal 
Procedures Code. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Critics of the Criminal Procedures Code still 
say 
it is soft on crime and confused. 
  [Gonzalez] This Code has some fundamental features that 
nobody has emphasized. It has changed the system of benefits. In 
the old system there were automatic sentence reductions: 
Urdinola's attorney showed up and said here is his information, 
then the judge had to grant an automatic reduction without being 
able to evaluate the quality of that information. 
  Now, with the CPP reform, the effects of such information 
are 
not automatic. The Prosecutor General's Office can say: we are 
not interested in that information because it does nothing for 
us, so we are not going to give a significant sentence reduction. 
  The prosecutor can now adjust the reduction from one-sixth 
to 
two-thirds. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The maximum sentence for drug trafficking is 12 
years; then there are all sorts of reductions for good behavior, 
education, family visits, etc. This means that the sentences are 
almost ludicrous, but the Code retains that system. 
  [Gonzalez] The reduction for good behavior and education is 
part of the resocialization process for prisoners. That is a 
good part of the reason why our jails have not exploded like the 
ones in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. It is because people 
are studying or working; that is the only way to resocialize 
prisoners. 
  The problem is abuses in sentencing. For example, some 
criminals ask for a sentence reduction, claiming that they work 
24 hours a day plus Saturdays and Sundays; that is absurd. Mr. 
Mejia Sanin (the first drug trafficker to turn himself in), 
submitted a ridiculous list for work reduction. 
  We also have to realize that the majority of the sentences, 
like those for the Ochoas and Urdinola, for example, were not 
issued under the new Code. If Law 81 (the new CPP) had been in 
effect for Urdinola's case, he would not have gotten such a 
light sentence. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why? 
  [Gonzalez] Mr. Urdinola is a person who, for all his crimes, 
was given 17.5 years in jail, and that was immediately and 
automatically reduced by 71 months for informing. Now 
prosecutors can graduate sentence reduction benefits. 
  We have to realize that a number of laws preceding the Code 
reform are still being applied; they need a more restrictive 
interpretation. 
  One problem is that Law 30 of 1986 establishes automatic 
sentence reduction benefits for informing. Most of the drug 
traffickers' attorneys have been using that law because it 
provides automatic benefits. The legislators must have realized 
this when it was passed, because of what was going on at that 
time. Still, there are other legal principles that can be 
applied to make it more rational, like the principle of 
proportionality. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What do you mean? 
  [Gonzalez] In each case the method used, the person's 
record, 
and the circumstances need to be considered. There cannot be a 
systematic mathematical interpretation. There must be a complete 
and objective interpretation of the laws. 
  The prosecutor and the judge must distinguish between 
different situations. If a person informs on the role played by 
an employee on his farm, a subordinate, or a minor in the 
commission of a crime, that cannot produce the same effects as 
if the farm worker gave information on a major criminal or the 
head of a criminal organization. 
  People need to realize that the CPP has totally changed the 
system of automatic reductions for a system of flexible and 
discretional reductions. 
  [EL TIEMPO] If the change was as positive as you say, then 
what are the problems with the CPP? 
  [Gonzalez] The problem is that many cases are still being 
tried with the old system. Law 30 of 1986 provides an automatic 
reduction which is certainly not appropriate, and that distorts 
the new Code. 
  [EL TIEMPO] That law is applied because it has not been 
repealed, and in Colombia the principle of "favorability" exists. 
  [Gonzalez] It has been tacitly repealed by Law 81, so it can 
not continue to be applied. If tomorrow Messrs. X, Y, or Z try 
to get Law 30 applied, we believe that can not be done. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Then the judge who applies it can be charged 
with 
professional misconduct? 
  [Gonzalez] We do not have to go that far. The most important 
thing is for us to say, and that is my goal as minister, that we 
have a number of old laws still being applied, and in our view 
this merits reflection on the part of us all -- the entire legal 
community, all of the media -- so they will not continue to be 
applied. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why not repeal all that legislation that 
contradicts the new Code? 
  [Gonzalez] No, that would do nothing for us. A tacit and an 
explicit repeal have the same effects, meaning that the old laws 
can no longer be applied. It means that what must be applied is 
the new Code. 
  [EL TIEMPO] With these varied interpretations, what can be 
done to unify standards? 
  [Gonzalez] We have to work together with the Prosecutor 
General's Office, with the Attorney General's Office, to train 
judges and prosecutors and put a stop to this and say, wait a 
minute: legal interpretations granting all sorts of reductions 
with no basis in law cannot continue to be used. 
  I also believe we need to call upon all the judges to make a 
joint stand to fight a very serious problem. The greatest 
service we could do for criminals is to fight among ourselves; 
those people would be delighted. I want all of us to work 
together to support some restrictive interpretation criteria. 
The Supreme Court of Justice and the courts play a very 
important role. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Then Law 30 should not continue to be applied? 
  [Gonzalez] Law 30 is contrary to the new CPP and so it has 
[essentially] been repealed. That law provides automatic 
sentence reductions, and what the new Code contains is flexible 
and discretional, not automatic reductions. 
  There is also another law that should not be used as it 
contradicts the new Code: Law 48 of 1987, which provides a fixed 
reduction of one-sixth for persons who committed crimes before 1 
July 1986. 
  That law should apply only to crimes committed before July 
1986, but sometimes misinterpretations are made. How is it 
possible, I wonder, for a person who committed a crime covered 
by Law 48 of 1987, and who then continues committing crimes 
after that date, to get that benefit? How can a person invoke it 
by saying: "I committed part of the crime before 1986, and get 
benefits under that law? 
  We need a very strict interpretation to avoid applying these 
regulations indiscriminately. Drug traffickers turn themselves 
in and say: "I started to commit crimes when I was very young." 
That sounds like sincerity, but later we may find it was 
designed to get the sentence reduction benefits offered by that 
law. 
  Another factor is also being incorrectly used, and that is 
related to accumulations of automatic reductions. The former CPP 
allowed an automatic accumulation for confessions and for early 
sentencing. That was abolished in the new Code, as two 
reductions can not be given for the same reason. 
  All this explains why sentences are so short: the benefits 
of 
Law 30 of 1986 are applied, plus the accumulation of reductions 
for early sentencing and confession in 90 percent of the cases. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You have discussed the Code's benefits. What are 
its defects? 
  [Gonzalez] Obviously, one cannot deny that there is always 
room for improvement. Perhaps some very specific points should 
be reviewed, but I believe the fundamental reform the Criminal 
Code needs is for the maximum ceilings on penalties to be raised. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You sent a letter to the Prosecutor General 
listing the parameters the government wanted for the policy of 
criminals turning themselves in; you asked, for example, that in 
his confession and information, the person who turns himself in 
must inform on at least three members of his organization. Why 
is that not in the Code? 
  [Gonzalez] Many things are in codes, while others obviously 
depend on the application in each case. A law is by nature 
general, not personal. This Code does provide evaluation 
criteria for confessions. 
  [EL TIEMPO] People say that attorneys working for drug 
traffickers "advised" some members of Congress on the new CPP. 
  [Gonzalez] In each specific case the results of that contact 
and its possible effects need to be evaluated. In Congress there 
were some positions that could have supported such interests; 
most of them were defeated. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Like what positions? 
  [Gonzalez] For example, that prior collaboration might be a 
factor in providing reductions or benefits, in the case of some 
alleged collaboration by the criminals in prosecuting other 
cartels or other criminals. That was rejected both by the 
government and by the Prosecutor General's Office, and Congress 
helped us there. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What was the source of such proposals? 
  [Gonzalez] I could not say exactly the source of such 
proposals, but what I can tell you is that we could clearly 
discern proposals that might favor some special interests, and 
we worked against them. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is a formal investigation being conducted? 
  [Gonzalez] There are groups both in Congress and in the 
judiciary with the authority to investigate that. 
  [EL TIEMPO] And are you, as minister, waiting to see what 
they will say? 
  [Gonzalez] As minister, I believe we need to do everything 
we 
can to clear up this matter. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Have you formally requested this? 
  [Gonzalez] I understand this information has started to come 
out, even at the initiative of some persons connected with those 
actions.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] 
President Jaime Yoshiyama announced the establishment of the 
National Environment Authority [Autoridad Ambiental Nacional] 
which will guide and coordinate environment policies. 
  Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to swap part of the 
foreign debt for environment protection and measures against 
poverty.. Yoshiyama said: "A direct relationship exists between 
poverty, environmental damage, and sustainable development which 
must be considered in any international relations that are based 
on solidarity and shared responsibility." 
  Yoshiyama also asked developed countries to pardon part of 
the poor countries' foreign debt so as to restore economic 
well-being and assist development compatible with sustainability. 
  Yoshiyama made these remarks during a "Sustainable 
Development and Economic Growth in Ibero-America" 
entrepreneurial meeting. This meeting was part of the 22d AICO 
[Ibero-American Association of Chambers of Commerce] executive 
board meeting between 2 and 4 May. 
  Yoshiyama, who delivered the main lecture, admitted that 
human rights, the removal of poverty, tariff agreements, the 
protection of intellectual property, and the protection of the 
environment are among the most important and universally 
relevant issues. 
  The ruling party congressman emphasized the significance of 
a 
common strategy among the regional countries to cope with the 
problem of universal environment protection. 
  Yoshiyama also asked for a change in attitudes and 
practices, 
specially by developed countries, and the transfer of the 
technology needed by developing countries to protect their 
environments. He said he wants costs and benefits of 
sustainable development to be equally shared at the 
international level. Yoshiyama wants large-scale education 
policies to make people aware of the importance of the 
environmental issue. 
  He announced that a National Environment Authority would be 
established within the next few weeks. This National 
Environment Authority will guide and coordinate environmental 
policies. Marc Dourojeanni, Inter-American Development Bank 
environment division chief, hailed this announcement and offered 
a donation of $2 million toward this National Environment 
Authority. 
  Yoshiyama explained that the new Constitution includes, 
among 
the human rights, the right to a balanced environment that 
favors the development of life. He added that the CCD is 
working on this. 
  To the surprise and approval of the large number of 
participants at the AICO meeting, Yoshiyama said: "I want to 
announce that within the next few weeks the Peruvian Congress 
will vote on a bill to establish a National Environment 
Authority." Yoshiyama emphasized: "In response to the concern 
of public and private organizations, the National Environment 
Authority will guide and coordinate environment policies and 
control the sustainable use of our natural resources. It will 
also guide actions in this area." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 12 May (EFE) -- Today, the Defense Ministry 
reported the arrest of nine members of the Maoist Shining Path. 
They were captured during an antisubversive Army operation in 
the northern Peruvian jungle from 6 to 9 May. Among those 
arrested are three women and the governor of Punchao village, 
who tried to bribe Army members to free two of the arrested 
subversives. 
  The Defense Ministry communique points out that an Shining 
Path group occupied Cachicoto settlement on 7 May, murdered a 
"narcoterrorist," and seized 150 kg of cocaine base and $90,000. 
These events occurred in Huanuco and San Martin Departments in 
the northern Peruvian jungle.

  [Text] Following orders given about a month ago by Oscar 
Alberto Ramirez Durand, now known by his followers as "President 
Feliciano," members of the self-styled "Red Path" dissident 
Shining Path faction have implemented a plan that seeks to 
recover their strategic balance. 
  As is well known, this strategic balance was lost with 
Abimael Guzman's fall and with the disruption of the leaderships 
of the central, permanent, and political committees that were in 
charge of leading the subversive war. 
  This is the conclusion of a report drafted by intelligence 
analysts and strategists after talking with Shining Path members 
at the grassroots and leadership levels, who availed themselves 
of the Repentance Law and who are now important collaborators in 
the struggle against narcoterrorism. 
  Opposed to Gonzalo's [Abimael Guzman's] leadership, "Red 
Path" is made up of groups that have been acting independently 
for several years with the support of narcotraffickers located 
in the coca-growing corridor established in the jungle area 
going from Amazonas to La Convencion (Cusco), and more recently 
part of Madre de Dios (Manu). 
  Based on confessions made by repentant Shining Path members, 
it has been established that the "Red Path" is striving to 
reactivate seven areas in the outskirts of Lima that before 
Guzman's fall were controlled by Shining Path and were 
considered red areas. Area residents were constantly harassed 
and did not dare to erase the so-called "people's bulletin 
boards" (subversive graffiti). And even less to report them, 
despite knowing who they were. 
  These areas were El Carmen, Collique, and Ano Nuevo (Comas); 
the former Bocanegra ranch (Callao); the San Cosme, El Pino, El 
Agustino (La Victoria), and Canto Grande (San Juan de 
Lurigancho) hills; Sectors 1 and 4 (Villa El Salvador); 
Huachipa, Ate-Vitarte (Central Highway); and Villa Maria del 
Triunfo and San Juan de Miraflores, which form a single bloc. 
This is where the Red Path faction members want to return. 
  Repentant Shining Path leaders, who have presented 
themselves 
at the 303d Battalion at the Huallaga Front and at other 
barracks throughout the country, have reported that Ramirez 
Durand, taking partial advantage of the campaign against the 
Army in view of alleged human rights violations, is trying to 
prevent a vast sector of Lima shantytown residents and some 
peasant communities from identifying themselves with the 
democratic system of government and the democratic state. 
  To do that, an effort would be made in those sectors -- 
called the masses by Ramirez Durand -- to create a generalized 
environment of insecurity and fear of the Armed Forces. 
Therefore, distorted cases of human rights violations have been 
reported, such as the report that the Army was bombing towns 
which were in reality a few shacks used by coca growers and drug 
traffickers as refuge. 
  He also ordered -- we saw that in the last few weeks, the 
repentant subversives said -- the intimidation and murder of 
popular leaders in the settlements to gradually take over the 
positions of leadership so as to be able to take control over 
the population. He also wants to get a number of rural 
settlements in the Lima area to passively accept the now-called 
"Red Path," as happened in the past with the Shining Path. 
  The repentant subversives said Ramirez Durand's 
recommendations include the reactivation of popular theaters and 
folk music groups, and the infiltration of work centers, 
especially in the factories located on the central highway where 
a few years ago, on orders from Abimael Guzman, anti-Shining 
Path union leaders and executives were murdered. 
  In this regard, intelligence sources indicated that the 
Shining Path members who had infiltrated some factories, and who 
after Abimael Guzman was captured, have been keeping a low 
profile, would again become active in planning to take over the 
unions and create chaos. 
  According to political analysts, what Ramirez Durand does 
not 
seem to understand is that it is only possible to reach a 
strategic equilibrium before the turning point of the war, and 
never after. In other words, when the struggle is on its way to 
victory, and never, as it is happening with the Shining Path, 
when it is obviously on its way to defeat. 
  The experts say that no matter how many attacks are carried 
out by terrorism, they will not frighten the population and will 
under no circumstances win their support, as, according to the 
latest surveys made by intelligence circles, the people who 
migrated from the subversive areas reject the subversive 
ideology. For example, the recent murder of boxer Carlos 
Lavalle Gonzales and other leaders has only created greater 
repudiation of the Shining Path. 
  In view of a new offensive, intelligence strategists 
recommend the reinforcement of the self-defense committees in 
the outskirts of Lima, with the support of the Armed Forces. 
  The analysts believe that the reinforcement of the urban 
defense patrols and night watches, and a better rapprochement 
with political and military authorities, will help reject any 
maneuver aimed against the democratic system. Now, in contrast 
with the past, the state and society have shown they are capable 
of defeating subversion.

<F P=106> ["A Farewell to Arms" column by Carlos Tapia: "The Rondas </F>
Campesinas and the Self-Defense Committees"] 
  [Text] A large sector of public opinion is confusing the 
peasant rondas in the northern part of the country, which 
appeared in the mid-1970's, with the peasant self-defense 
committees, formed in the south-central part of the country for 
defense against terrorist subversion. 
  The term "rondero" is used indiscriminately to describe two 
very different phenomena. Gradually, beginning with TV images of 
peasants, men and women, receiving shot guns, as well as the 
martial bearing evidenced in military parades, there is a 
tendency to identify the ronderos as armed peasants prepared to 
confront terrorists. This distorts the reality. 
  The northern rondas appeared in 1976 at the initiative of 
the 
peasants themselves, to combat cattle theft, and they 
subsequently broadened their activities to include the 
resolution of internal disputes. They became an effective, 
although informal, administrator of peasant justice. 
  Furthermore, they were formed within the democratic spirit 
of 
combating the arbitrariness and corruption expressed by the 
binomial police-judge that had always been prejudicial to their 
interests. At times they became a valuable instrument for the 
mobilization of the peasantry against hoarding and price 
increases of products from the cities. 
  There are currently 3,500 rondas, concentrated mostly in the 
department of Cajamarca and the provinces of Ayabaca, 
Huancabamba, and Morropon in the department of Piura. 
  On the other hand, the "armed rondas" of the south-central 
part of the country, known as "antisubversive civil defense," 
began to appear in 1983 as a consequence of the need for defense 
against attacks by Shining Path's platoons and columns. 
  From the beginning, either voluntarily or due to pressure 
from the Armed Forces, they had a military organization and 
purpose. They were obliged to become specialists in defensive 
"patrolling" or the pursuit of Shining Path platoons and 
columns. In practice, they learned the tactics of ambush and 
counterambush. 
  In 1988 they spread out from Ayacucho--particularly from the 
Apurimac river valley where they became powerful--to 
Huancavelica and Satipo province, covering a large area where 
Shining Path had established itself strategically. During the 
same period a similar process occurred in the Tulumayo valley, 
in Concepcion province in the department of Junin, which 
succeeded in stopping Shining Path and putting it on the 
defensive in the countryside. 
  These armed peasant organizations were legally recognized in 
1991 and placed under the Armed Forces Joint Command, giving 
them the title of Self-Defense Committees. 
  Inexplicably, a supreme decree in January 1993 also imposed 
military norms and controls on the northern rondas. This serious 
error should be corrected as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Retired General Jaime Salinas Sedo by </F>
Mariella Balbi and Eduardo Guzman at Real Felipe Prison; date 
not given: "Hermoza Is Afraid of Us" -- first paragraph is LA 
REPUBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] In the following pages Gen (Ret) Jaime Salinas Sedo 
states from his cell in Real Felipe Prison that discontent is 
increasing in the ranks of the Army. The crisis in the barracks, 
the fears of the military high command, and the prospects 
looking toward the 1995 elections are the subjects covered here 
by the constitutionalist military officer. This interview was 
also broadcast over Radio "Miraflores" during the well-known 
political program, "Doble Sentido" [Double Meaning]. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] General Salinas, the Army Information Office 
(OIE) has published a statement in which it is stated that 
"freedom of information is being improperly used" and that there 
is a campaign orchestrated by the media to make the Army look 
like a "violator of human rights linked to the narcotics traffic 
and an institution with internal problems." What do you think of 
this? 
  [Salinas] In the Army there is a policy on the dissemination 
of information. More than anything else, it is the 
responsibility of the command to keep officers informed about 
military developments. However, in the information bulletin to 
which you refer there is a marked, political orientation. 
Unfortunately, its contents are going to contribute to greater 
divisions between civilians and military personnel because there 
is a great deal of misinformation in it. It is being said that 
the press is attacking the Army as an institution. As far as I 
know, and I follow the news very closely, none of the 
communications media has attacked the Army. The media have 
denounced some bad elements within the Army, which is something 
very different. This document to which you refer not only 
mentions the Peruvian media but speaks of a national and 
international campaign against the Army. The truth is that I do 
not understand this. In my view this is an error. And the 
principal person responsible in a vertically organized 
institution like ours is the commanding general of the Army. 
This document offers nothing good to civilians and military 
personnel, nor does it contribute to the democratic stability 
which we all desire so much. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Would you say that the high command of the 
Army feels threatened by news reports? 
  [Salinas] The prestige of the armed forces has never been as 
low as it is now. In our view the person responsible for this 
situation is the commanding general of the Army, not because he 
has been involved in this or that matter but simply because he 
holds that position. He should resign, but what is happening? 
Instead of resigning, he is hiding behind the Army as an 
institution. He uses it to save his skin. He misinforms the 
officers, making them think that any attack against him as a 
person is an attack against the Army. Anyone who has any sense 
knows that that is not true. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Nevertheless, the president and General 
Hermoza himself state that the Army as an institution supports 
the commanding general. 
  [Salinas] That is the version which they wish to sell to the 
Peruvian people. At present General Hermoza has no support 
within the Army. Military personnel obey him because 
hierarchically and in accordance with the Fujimori law he is the 
commanding general. We have heard, from meetings which General 
Hermoza has held and from the views expressed by officers on 
active duty that they are very critical of what General Hermoza 
has said. I am talking about officers on active duty. That means 
that the story about support for General Hermoza is a falsehood. 
He maintains his position at the top of the Army because he 
holds power, and that provides support for President Fujimori. 
Look, I am not the only one saying this. Within the Army there 
is a kind of Gestapo. Any officer who opens his mouth and who 
expresses an opinion is automatically marked down by that 
Gestapo. On the other hand, the man who informs on him is going 
to get a promotion or will be assigned abroad. There is a great 
deal of fear of speaking one's opinion freely. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Then is it impossible to have a change of 
commanding general? 
  [Salinas] In the Army, speaking of it as an institution, 
there is no way in which the commanding general can be removed 
from office. There would have to be a complaint that he had 
committed a certain crime, and then the matter could be brought 
to the attention of the military justice system. As things are 
now the commanding general comes directly under the authority of 
the president. He holds a political position. Therefore, any 
kind of criticism within the Army is regarded as a political 
attitude and looks as if the intention is to stage a coup 
d'etat. For that reason General Hermoza is filled with hatred 
against us and is determined to make sure that we do not get out 
of prison. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Then President Fujimori is not on your side? 
  [Salinas] I do not think so, because, however much he may be 
a nontraditional politician, as they say, or that he does not 
have much experience, he must understand that this is a 
political problem which is doing a great deal of damage to the 
image of the country. I am sure that on many occasions he would 
have liked to resolve this matter, but the anger comes from 
General Hermoza. He is afraid that if we are out of prison, we 
could cut the ground out from under him. This is not our 
intention, but everyone has his own kind of fear. What I can 
assure you of is that, within the armed forces, most of the 
officers are in total disagreement with this political 
manipulation of the Army as an institution, which is doing so 
much harm to it. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Among the things which are doing the most 
harm 
to the armed forces are the well-founded accusations that, 
basically, it is providing support for the narcotics traffic. 
What is going to happen about this? 
  [Salinas] The worst mistake which the armed forces made was 
to become involved in the struggle against the narcotics 
traffic, because this would corrupt anyone. The power of money 
is very great and especially so since our officers are very 
poorly paid. However, in any case the guilty parties must be 
severely punished. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Are those punishments being handed out? 
General Hermoza has stated that no Army officer is involved in 
the "Vatican" case. Do you think that this is plausible? 
  [Salinas] The information which Major Castillo has provided 
has been corroborated by officers on active duty who have made 
this known to us. Regarding General Hermoza's statement they 
have commented that, "Nobody believes him because all of us know 
that there certainly were officers involved in the narcotics 
traffic at the time when the `Vatican' was in the area." They 
must be punished for the good of the Army as an institution. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] And why are they being provided with cover, 
general? Who is protecting them? 
  [Salinas] I would not say that they are protected. This has 
come out at a time when the image of the Army as an institution 
has seriously deteriorated, and they are trying to make sure 
that this image does not get worse. In my view that is an error 
because if cases like that have occurred, it would be better to 
resolve the problem--once and for all. That is, cutting off a 
gangrenous leg so that the whole body is not affected. They are 
trying to hide things, and that makes people have doubts about 
the Army as an institution. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Would you say that the Army has become a 
political party? 
  [Salinas] I would not say that. Yes, there is a high 
ranking, 
politicized group which is politically manipulating promotions. 
But the ordinary officer himself is not politicized. He wants to 
be a worthy professional soldier in the service of the 
fatherland. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Are you afraid that in the next elections the 
armed forces will participate actively in the election process? 
  [Salinas] The armed forces have been improperly used in the 
CCD [Congressional] elections. I think that an attempt to do 
this will be repeated. However, on the basis of the information 
which I receive from officers in the Army they are going to 
oppose that attitude. They are not going to become involved in 
distributing leaflets and photographs or collecting signatures, 
as they were required to do in the previous election. The 
officers as a group are rejecting such an improper use of them. 
As far as I know, they want the Peruvian people to understand 
that the armed forces, and the Army in particular, is going to 
behave in a clean, open, and impartial way. Now, it is probable 
that the orders have been issued, because General Hermoza is 
going to want to place the armed forces, and the Army in 
particular, at the service of President Fujimori. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] If Fujimori does not win the next elections, 
could this put the armed forces in a difficult situation? 
  [Salinas] The armed forces owe their loyalty to the 
government elected democratically by the people and not to 
President Fujimori. Undoubtedly, within the armed forces, there 
are people who, because they have committed themselves 
politically, have gone beyond the limits of their duties. The 
next government will see what punishments apply to them. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Do you think that this will create a tense 
situation? 
  [Salinas] Certainly, that faction in the Army will try to do 
what it can. Fujimori cannot be blamed. However, those who know 
that he is at fault are going to join together. Nevertheless, I 
think that the Army as an institution is not going to allow 
these manipulations to continue merely to save the skins of two 
or three people who have only done harm to the Army. However 
much that faction may wish to keep itself in power at all cost, 
come what may, the officers are not going to support them. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Although the candidacy of Javier Perez de 
Cuellar has not yet been decided, the political parties are not 
much prepared to join in getting behind him. How do you see the 
prospects for this? 
  [Salinas] For me it is a matter of concern that the election 
problem has not been resolved and that Congress is postponing 
debate until April [1994]. This is just a delaying action. I do 
not understand how there can be people who believe that all of 
that is simply the result of some kind of real, democratic game. 
In fact, it is a carefully planned game to ensure that the 
opposition has the least possible time to prepare itself for the 
elections of 1995. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Do you think that the opposition is poorly 
prepared because of its lack of decision and not because of the 
problem of the elections law? 
  [Salinas] There is a need for the leaders of the opposition 
to get together and reach agreement. My concern, and I believe 
that it is also yours, is that they are letting a lot of time to 
go by before they define their positions. There can be a single 
candidate or three or four opposition candidates. There can be a 
thousand solutions to this problem. What is needed is for the 
political leaders to sit down right now and adopt a strategy. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Is it a matter of no concern as to whether 
there is one or several candidates? 
  [Salinas] Look, I have not been a politician but a military 
officer. I am involved in politics because I am in prison. 
However, I think that if the opposition disperses its forces, it 
will be more difficult to face up to Fujimori, because he is 
going to use all of the resources of the state to be reelected. 
If wasps attack me one a minute, I will continue to kill them 
with a fly swatter. But if a thousand wasps attack me at the 
same time, I am dead. In the Army that is called the principle 
of mass. You have to use mass in the right place and at the 
right time. It seems to me that a single opposition candidate 
would be better, but a single program would be worth more than 
that. You have to reach agreement on a minimum program which 
must be respected by all political groups. And once everyone 
believes that it makes no difference who is the candidate, 
because that program is going to be followed, only then should 
we decide on a specific candidate. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Could you be that candidate, General Salinas, 
as Javier Valle Riestra has stated? 
  [Salinas] I am a prisoner in jail. I can only show my face 
behind the bars of my cell. No, that is out of the question. The 
person who should accept that challenge is someone who is free 
to move around, who can reach the people and explain to them 
what real, democratic choices they have in confronting the 
dictatorship. As far as I am concerned, a political decision has 
been made that I will not get out of here until after the 
elections. I have no ambition, nor do I wish to be a candidate. 
But even if I wanted it, I would simply be prevented from being 
a candidate. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Are the civic movements which are appearing 
in 
the provinces and here in Lima the nucleus of the future 
political party which you could lead within an opposition 
coalition? 
  [Salinas] They have not been organized with that in mind. 
They are very far from politics. They have been organized to 
demand freedom for us officers who are unjustly in prison. They 
will close down as we are given our freedom. The solution for 
the eight officers who are with me could be facilitated with 
this type of pressure. This would not apply to me, personally. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Why do you say that? 
  [Salinas] There is a particular kind of anger against me. 
The 
signatures which are being collected, calling for my release, 
are from all sectors and political parties. 
  [LA REPUBLICA] Finally, General Cisneros has stated that 
coups d'etat are not out of the question and that another 
Sergeant Huapaya could emerge. What do you think? 
  [Salinas] Our history is marked by a series of coups d'etat 
and democratic springtimes of very short duration. However, 
increasingly the armed forces throughout the world know that 
they are in the service of their country and not of a 
government. I would say that a coup d'etat is out of the 
question.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Ex-Minister of the Economy Gustavo Saberbein, after 
participating in an event organized by the APRA [American 
Popular Revolutionary Alliance] party in Arequipa, told the 
press that the neoliberal policies of the Fujimori government 
have led to the impoverishment of most Peruvians. 
  Saberbein said that the government cannot escape its 
responsibility in this regard, because it is the government's 
policies that have caused the number of Peruvians who live in 
conditions of acute poverty to increase from 7 million in July 
1990 to 12 million at present. 
  The ex-minister said that after three and a half years of 
the 
current government, production continues depressed, unemployment 
is overwhelming, and wages are extremely low, as a result of 
which Peru recently was declared by the FAO [UN Food and 
Agricultural Organization] one of the worst fed countries in the 
world, along with Haiti, Afghanistan, Burundi, and other 
extremely poor African countries. 
  Saberbein claimed that today in Peru, people are eating 
less, 
working less, and producing less than during the two previous 
democratic administrations. The social costs paid so far to 
reduce inflation, he said, are much greater than necessary, due 
to defects in the government's policies. 
  He said that farmers and peasants have been abandoned by the 
government, with the reduction in agricultural credit, the lack 
of technical assistance and massive imports of foodstuffs. 
Agricultural workers today are earning 50 percent less than in 
mid-1990, he added, saying that this is why they voted "no" so 
overwhelmingly. 
  Saberbein said that the government's policies have also 
placed industry at a disadvantage in competing with foreign 
producers, due to serious delays in foreign exchange 
transactions, lack of credit, the high cost of energy, and 
payment of antitechnological taxes. 
  He said that the government is wrong to think that foreign 
investment can replace domestic investment and take charge of 
our development. He maintained that no country has developed by 
following that principle, as development in all countries has 
been essentially the result of domestic investment. 
  Saberbein stated that, to strengthen the fight against 
inflation and increase domestic investment, current economic 
policy must be corrected so as to create favorable conditions 
for producers and workers, which would make possible better 
wages and more jobs through export promotion and sustained 
growth in production for the domestic market. 
  He said that the government's extremely liberal policies are 
not the solution that Peru needs. There are other alternatives 
that will correct yesterday's and today's mistakes. This is why, 
Saberbein said, the APRA has been working intensively to develop 
its program, to be able to offer the country before long a 
better alternative to the current government. 
  Saberbein explained that, as part of this activity, during 
the past 60 days the APRA has conducted five regional Program 
Sessions, one of which was that held this weekend in Arequipa, 
with the participation of leaders and activists from the 
departments and provinces in the southern part of the country. 
The event was opened by Engineer Javier Tantalean, president of 
the National Planning Commission of the PAP [Aprista Party of 
Peru], and was adjourned by ex-Deputy Carlos Roca, deputy 
secretary general of the APRA.

  [Text] Montevideo, 12 May (EFE) -- Uruguayan Interior 
Minister Raul Iturria tendered his resignation today so as to be 
able to devote himself to electoral activities and run for the 
post of mayor of Durazno, 196 km north of Montevideo. 
  Iturria was elected Durazno mayor twice. He resigned as 
Durazno mayor late last year to become interior minister, 
replacing Juan Andres Ramirez, who will be the ruling party's 
candidate to replace President Luis Alberto Lacalle. 
  Iturria said he would remain in his post until Lacalle 
appoints his replacement. 
  The Interior Ministry will control domestic security and 
guarantee the normal development of the elections scheduled for 
29 November.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 12 May: 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, has reported that 
the 
average income of Montevideo households increased 11 percent in 
real terms in the first quarter of 1994 compared with the 
corresponding period last year. It totals 5,215 pesos ($1,144) 
free of rent. The ceiling for the lower income bracket was 
2,713 pesos ($595) while the floor for the higher income bracket 
was 8,515 ($1,868). The INE further reported that salaries in

those in the public sector declined 1.6 percent in the same 
period. The average wage index grew 9.9 percent in the first 
quarter, representing a 1.9 percent increase in real terms. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 28 Apr 94 p 10) 
  The Central Bank disclosed on 29 April that wholesale prices 
rose 1 percent in April, which represents a 32.1 percent 
increase over the last 12 months. The upward trend of the 
wholesale price index continued in the first quarter of the 
year, increasing 8.2 percent compared with 7.4 percent in the 
corresponding period last year. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR

  [Text] Santiago, 11 May (NA) -- Today, Economics Minister 
Domingo Cavallo and Chilean President Eduardo Frei agreed it is 
necessary to advance in the physical integration between the two 
countries, through joint projects like the construction of a 
bridge, which links Mendoza with Santiago. 
  Cavallo met the Chilean president at La Moneda Palace, the 
Chilean government house. They reviewed the implementation of a 
number of bilateral projects including the construction of a 
tunnel, 2 km below the current one. 
  After meeting with Frei, Cavallo emphasized that companies 
with the required equipment are interested in this project. 
Cavallo noted that these companies constructed the tunnel under 
the English Channel, linking France with England. The minister 
indicated that this project would be implemented through "an 
investment system involving tolls and contributions by both 
countries." 
  A feasibility survey for constructing a border pass in the 
north is planned within the framework of integration. This 
project may begin in the city of Jama in Salta Province or the 
city of Sico in Jujuy Province. The chosen city will be linked 
with the Chilean city of Antofagasta. 
  Chile is very interested in receiving Argentine gas supplies 
while our country is especially interested in increasing the 
volume of national products through ports on the Pacific Ocean. 
  Cavallo announced that formal negotiations on the latest 
economic cooperation agreement will be held by the Argentine and 
Chilean Foreign Ministries within 30 days. 
  Concerning the possibility of Chile joining Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South], Cavallo said Frei "did not express a final 
response," but "reacted favorably to the idea." Chile is fully 
concentrating its energies on joining NAFTA and still has strong 
reserves on some Mercosur points. Chile believes there must be 
a gradual advancement toward free trade because it has problems 
adjusting its agriculture, especially grains and meat. 
  Cavallo accepted this idea, noting that "any advancement 
must 
be gradual because it is not possible to achieve zero tariffs in 
intraregional trade overnight." Cavallo emphasized that it is 
necessary to remove nontariff barriers which could "affect free 
trade." He noted that "realistic hygienic standards for 
vegetables and animals" alone should suffice. 
  The minister said he trusts the free-trade zone will be 
achieved on 1 January 1995, as established in the Treaty of 
Asuncion, and expressed hopes that a final decision on a common 
tariff system will be well advanced by then.

  [Text] Santiago, 12 May (EFE) -- In an interview published 
in LA EPOCA today, Argentine Economics Minister Domingo Cavallo 
said that the large deficit in his country's trade balance "is a 
symptom of health" because the increase in imports corresponds 
to capital goods. 
  Cavallo, who yesterday concluded a two-day visit to 
Santiago, 
said: "The impressive pace of investment in Argentina has meant 
a significant increase in machinery imports." 
  He added that the trade balance deficit "does not worry us 
at 
all" because imports are financed, and the deficit is being 
compensated with the capital account surplus of the balance of 
payments. 
  Cavallo explained that the government of President Carlos 
Menem is working on the regulations for labor negotiations, 
which he labeled as "a more flexible operation of the labor 
market." 
  Cavallo added: "We are addressing health, social welfare, 
and economic reforms in the provinces. The provincial 
governments have a great responsibility in the areas of 
security, justice, health, and education." 
  He asserted that the reforms are greatly supported by the 
Argentine people, and will continue no matter who heads the next 
government. He added, however, that if the Constitution is 
reformed President Menem will probably be reelected. 
  Asked about the fact that Argentina is becoming an example 
for Brazil, Cavallo said: "The future of the Latin American 
countries is closely linked, and therefore it is important for 
everyone that Brazil do well." 
  Cavallo noted: "I believe that being able to contribute our 
experience to the future of such an important country as Brazil 
is for me very pleasing."

  [Text] With a decision that caught most government 
officials by surprise, President Carlos Menem yesterday decided 
to group the Federal Police, the Coast Guard, and the Border 
Police, that is, the entire state security apparatus, under a 
future Secretariat for State Security. Menem chose Julian 
Licastro, a retired Army lieutenant with a long career within 
the Peronist party, to head this supersecretariat (it might also 
include management of the Secretariat for State Intelligence, 
SIDE). 
  In designing the new secretariat's structure Menem did not 
seem to realize some details: The future secretariat undermines 
the powers of the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry. 
  When the news had already spread outside the presidential 
office, the government was forced to issue a press communique in 
an attempt to calm the debate prompted by the proposal. 
  Some government officials attributed this initiative to 
[Economics Minister] Domingo Cavallo's team. One of Cavallo's 
team members even told CLARIN that on 8 May Licastro met the 
economics minister. In an attempt to explain Cavallo's alleged 
meddling in this issue, the source noted: "The management of 
roughly $2.6 billion that is spent on security is involved." 
  The official communique was issued late after the reports 
had 
already astonished SIDE, Defense Ministry, and Interior Ministry 
officials. SIDE, the Defense Ministry, and the Interior 
Ministry had been dealing with pieces of rumors, prompting an 
atmosphere of bewilderment and irritation. This atmosphere 
spread to the security forces involved. 
  To soothe the uproar, but raising more questions, the press 
communique's first paragraph notes: "As it is necessary to 
achieve an effective coordination among the various security 
forces involved in the protection of public property and in the 
struggle against crime and drug trafficking, the president of 
the nation has given instructions to the interior and defense 
ministers to study the formation of a State Secretariat for 
Interior Security. 
<H5>  Social Violence </H5>
  Nevertheless, the communique did not manage to clear other 
doubts: Would the Drug Enforcement Secretariat, headed by 
Alberto Lestelle, also be included in the same package? Will 
SIDE, as had initially been indicated, be included or not? Will 
this be the organization to command the rapid deployment units 
that are being planned to repress social disorders that 
overwhelm the provincial police? It seemed that no one at 
Government House last night had any response to these issues. 
  The official communique's belated caution, with 
announcements 
such as "to study the formation of" or "to plan the new 
organization's operational structure," was prompted after those 
covered by the Interior Security Law at their fingertips went to 
the Government House to caution about the legal and political 
challenges that will undoubtedly be raised by various circles, 
including the security forces themselves. 
  This issue will be discussed during a cabinet meeting at the 
Olivos presidential residence. Menem's proposal seeks to group 
military units, intelligence activities, and drug enforcement 
forces under a single head. This disagrees with the spirit and 
provisions of a law agreed upon between Peronists and Radicals, 
who also make up a bicameral monitoring committee that was also 
not consulted before taking this step. 
  Nevertheless, an official involved in drawing up legal 
standards and decrees assured CLARIN that a presidential decree 
alone would be required to establish the new secretariat. This 
official, however, emphasized that such a presidential decree 
has not yet been drawn up, and that Licastro has not yet been 
appointed as secretary. 
  The source actually noted that in order to establish a 
secretariat of such characteristics, the Interior Ministry's 
Undersecretariat, headed by Hugo Franco would be dissolved and 
at least the status of SIDE would be changed.

  [Text] Antonio Casas Gonzalez, president of the Venezuelan 
Central Bank, has pointed out that the existence of a parallel 
currency market in dollars cannot be avoided given that demand 
is greater than supply. The Central Bank president made this 
statement when he appeared before the Chamber of Deputies 
Economy Committee. 
  [Begin Casas recording] The parallel market exists because 
the demand is greater than supply. This is a phenomenon that 
occurs in every case where there is a [word indistinct] system. 
We seek to converge these [passage indistinct] there is no 
reason to mistrust the currency nor this nation's economic 
future. We therefore hope to unify the exchange rate soon in a 
free market. We cannot control the market because it is free. We 
have not placed controls on the exchange rate. What we have done 
is exploit the currency. [end recording] 
  Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez noted the Executive 
Branch's concern with the parallel market that has evolved as a 
result of the public bidding on dollars carried out by the 
Venezuelan Central Bank. In this regard, the minister said that 
some measures [words indistinct]. Sosa Rodriguez said that the 
economic cabinet today analyzed the estimates for the 1995 
budget.

  [Text] Cesar Quintino Rosales, minister of transport and 
communications, has reiterated emphatically that student fares 
are fully valid. He added that the subsidy granted to 
transportation workers to guarantee this benefit will be 
maintained to support students. 
  When leaving the Council of Ministers, the minister of 
transport and communications denied a newspaper report published 
in a Caracas daily on an alleged elimination of the subsidy. 
  [Begin Quintino Rosales recording] In response to a report 
published in last Tuesday's press regarding an alleged 
elimination of the subsidy to student fares, the Ministry of 
Transport and Communication expressed emphatically the following: 
  The subsidy to student fare will be maintained as an 
incentive to support students. With this declaration, the 
government ratifies and maintains firmly the commitment signed 
last March to preserve the current system until the last day of 
July, and later replace it by a form of payment more 
transparent, equitable, and clear. 
  Additionally, we state our strong opposition to blackmail 
and 
illegal measures of coercion, violence, and public order 
alterations, which result in loss of life among our youths. [end 
recording] 
  Meanwhile, given the surprising announcement of a new 
transportation strike by the Single Union of Independent 
Vehicles for next Monday, the faction of councilmen of the 
Social Christian Party, Copei, asked the leaders of said union 
to reflect on the consequences of the strike. We consider, 
Councilman Moises Benaim said, that the situation of the country 
demands greater tactfulness at the time of making decisions, 
such as leaving Caracas once more without transportation, 
following an action in which the population displayed their 
civic behavior. People could react negatively if they are 
pressured and made to suffer by leaving them without service, he 
added. 
  [words indistinct] a Chamber of Deputies Financial 
Commission 
led by Legislator Gonzalo Perez has appointed a subcommission to 
begin an investigation on the 50-percent discount on the student 
fare. The announcement was made by the very deputy, in 
statements to our reporter Vinicio Sanchez. 
  [Begin Perez recording] Engineer (Maya Ortega) and Carlos 
Sindoni have today come to the subcommission I preside to ratify 
their report. These former officials of the Ministry of 
Transport and Communications, who have to do with the 
directorate created to subsidize transportation for students, 
have ratified the Ministry of Transport and Communications has 
made timely payments for many years to transportation workers 
not offering this service. They stated they presented their 
report to the Rafael Iribarren, former deputy minister of 
transportation and communication, to whom they presented 12 
folders. Those 12 folders were requested by the Financial 
Commission and they have not been forwarded by the Ministry of 
Transport and Communications. 
  They also expressed Eng. Iribarren's report on student 
subsidy is a gimmick, adding he has acted irresponsibly. The 
former officials noted Iribarren dismantled the operating 
structure of this subsidy at the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications, adding this is why today there are no controls. 
We will process all these reports, and next week we will talk 
with Eng. Rafael Iribarren to hear his account of the events.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government has decided to militarize the 
nation's most important cities to control the destabilizing 
events that have intensified during the past few days. 
Education Minister Antonio Luis Cardenas, in his report, said 
leaders of these actions have established strong holds in high 
school buildings, using students as cannon fodder to disrupt 
public order. 
  The minister assured that the police officer who shot 
student 
German Sotillo during disturbances at the Fermin Toro school, 
had acted with premeditation. Sotillo died last week. After 
the police officer was arrested, a bullet of the same caliber 
used to kill the youngster, was found hidden inside one of his 
socks. Faced with this fact, the education minister asked: Who 
is behind this officer? Or did the hairy hand [mano 
peluda]--many times mentioned by the interior minister--pull the 
trigger. 
  The executive cabinet informs that a Military Intelligence 
Division Directorate report indicates there is a destabilizing 
plan that would be initiated through disturbances and would be 
instigated by--among others--hooded individuals. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] We are discussing this today; it 
appears there is a destabilizing plan. The nation has to decide 
what we want to do. Do we want to keep the current government 
that is struggling against corruption, that is struggling for 
stability and is struggling to reorient this nation, or are we 
going to return to corruption and the disaster we had before? 
Or do we want a dictatorship? [end recording] 
  To conclude, Minister Antonio Luis Cardenas called on 
parents 
and student representatives to come out and defend the 
government-run high schools that are being used by subversives, 
while he urged the student not be deceived by those who are 
seeking the nation's destabilization.

  [Text] For the third straight day, students and police 
clashed in Caracas. The clashes left three injured and more than 
30 others arrested. On 11 May, a long day of protest started in 
the early morning hours, specifically at the Francisco Fajardo 
School located in U.V. Siete de Caricuoa. The day of protest 
left three students injured, as well as 30 arrested by 
metropolitan police agents. 
  At the Francisco Fajardo School on Caricuoa, three students 
were wounded. One of these students--Marvin Uzcategui--was shot 
in the stomach; Juan Carlos Vivas, a 15-year-old student, was 
shot in the ribs; and Guillermo Useche got a shot in the arm. 
According to witnesses, the shots were fired by Metropolitan 
Police deployed along the main streets of the area known as U.V. 
Siete de Caricuoa, who opened fire on the protesters. 
  Nevertheless, General Orlando Henandez Villega, the 
commander 
of the Metropolitan Police, categorically denied these reports. 
  [Begin Hernandez recording] I want to reiterate what I said 
previously. The Metropolitan Police are not using firearms to 
quell the demonstrations. Clear proof of this is that, if 
firearms had been used at Francisco Fajardo School, there would 
have been wounded students. Instead, the wounded included a 
five-year-old who was not demonstrating, as well as a 
15-year-old from a neighborhood next to the school. Apparently, 
there were clashes with criminals or shots were fired in the 
area, resulting in these people being wounded. [end recording] 
  Despite General Orlando Hernandez Guillen's version of what 
happened, it was unofficially learned that, according to 
officers of the Technical Judicial Police's Homicide Division, 
police officers opened fire with .38 caliber weapons on students 
protesting the hike in student bus fares. 
  Violent demonstrations also were reported at other schools, 
such as Fermin Toro in El Silencio; Luis Espelozin; Miguel 
Antonio Carela on Sucre Ave.; and Luis Blanco in Propatria, 
where two police officers were wounded. Also, in the wake of 
disturbances at the Jose Felix Ribas School, which is located on 
the main road in Dos Caminos, a store was looted. There also 
were disturbances reported at the Luis Caballero Mejia 
Politechnical Institute in La Yaguara, at the Central University 
of Venezuela, the Instituto Pedagogico of Paraiso, and the Campo 
Rico Technical School in El Marquez. 
  Officers from the Metropolitan Police and the National 
Guard's Urban Security Brigade continue to be deployed 
throughout the city in an attempt to control all of these 
outbreaks of violence.

  [Text] Paraguay's and Uruguay's intention to create an 
Export Processing Zone [EPZ] within Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South] has caused turbulence in Brazilian-Uruguayan 
negotiations over the creation of a South American Free Trade 
Area. 
  Uruguay has questioned the domestic components index of the 
products to be traded within Mercosur, fearing that its 
incipient industry might be devastated by Argentine and 
Brazilian competition. As compensation, it asked for the 
creation of an EPZ. The Brazilian Government does not agree to 
this, as it would deactivate the Manaus duty-free zone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister </F>
and foreign minister, by Carmen Vrljicak-Espain; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Vrljicak-Espain] What does the cultural agreement 
you have just reached with Argentina include; is it satisfactory 
and what to you expect in the future? 
  [Granic] We have decided to begin cooperation but we have 
not 
specified details. Among other things, we have agreed to 
recognize diplomas in a cultural agreement. We are waiting for 
the signing of another five agreements in the economic sector. 
We believe they will be signed within a month. They pertain to 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy and matters in the veterinary 
sector -- the most important agreement being the one pertaining 
to legal security and the protection of investments -- and we 
will also sign an agreement to prevent double taxation. We 
already have exemplary relations with Argentina from the 
political viewpoint; Argentina was one of the first countries to 
recognize us. We also have Argentine Blue Helmets in our 
territory, and we recently received the visit of President 
Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. We are now 
entering into the economic and trade phases. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] How will you undertake relations with the 
rest of Latin America? 
  [Granic] We are interested mainly in Argentina, Chile, and 
Brazil. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] Argentina does not have an embassy in 
Croatia. What will be done in this respect? 
  [Granic] For the time being we will manage through Vienna 
because it is just a budget matter. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] Regarding your relations with Russia and 
the conflict with the Serbs, why was the recent cease-fire 
agreement signed at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb? 
  [Granic] It is true Russia is favorably disposed toward 
Serbia, but the Russian Federation also recognizes Croatian 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. They organized these 
negotiations and as such proposed that the agreement should be 
signed at their embassy where representatives of the United 
States and United Nations were present. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] How would you define Croatian-Russian 
relations? 
  [Granic] They can be considered as correct relations because 
Russia recognizes us. It must not be forgotten that Russia 
wants a role in the geopolitics of Southeast Europe and 
influence over Serbia. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] Is Vladimir Zhirinovsky's proposal 
regarding Pan-Slavism disquieting because it excludes Croatians 
and because it presumably counts on Russian hegemony, especially 
if we take into account rumors on Boris Yeltsin's health? 
  [Granic] We are closely following Russian policies. But for 
the time being, we are managing with official relations and 
positions. This does not mean current relations with Russia will 
remain the same if Zhirinovsky comes to power. This matter not 
only concerns Croatia, it also concerns the United States and 
the international community. 
  [Vrljical-Espain] What is your evaluation of the 
international community's attitude during the past 2 years, its 
current attitude, and what are the prospects? 
  [Granic] I believe it should have been much more active. 
Croatia said this from the beginning. Today, Croatia considers 
relations are very good, especially with the United States 
following the Washington Agreements. For the first time, a 
four-member contact group has been created that includes the 
United States, the Russian Federation, the United Nations, and 
the EU [European Union] seeking solutions to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and the UN protected zones. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] Many people ask why is there so much hate 
between Serbs and Croatians, is it an atavistic conflict or are 
there other reasons? 
  [Granic] They are different peoples. In the 9th century, 
Croatia was a kingdom with its own language, culture, and 
influence. Croatia was part of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy 
for 500 years, while it has only lived beside the Serbs for a 
mere 75 years. In 1989, the presidents of Slovenia and Croatia 
submitted a proposal to transform what had once been Yugoslavia 
into a modern confederation. Serbia said it wanted a centralized 
federation, in other words, a Greater Serbia. When it saw that 
it could not achieve its objective through negotiations, it 
resorted to arms. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] What relations does Croatia have with 
Serbia? 
  [Granic] We do not have diplomatic relations, and there will 
be no relations until they recognize our sovereignty and 
territorial integrity. We maintain a contact office which was 
opened within the framework of the Geneva Conference through 
intermediaries. We want to normalize relations with them, but 
only through recognition. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] We know Croatia had an enormous number of 
refugees inside and outside its borders. What is the current 
situation and what measures are being taken? 
  [Granic] Croatia is currently looking after 250,000 of its 
own people and 280,000 refugees from Bosnia. More than 600,000 
people have crossed the territory (from Bosnia) who went to 
Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia, and Austria. It is estimated 
that there are still 80,000 to 100,000 displaced persons for 
which Croatia wishes to care. It is our desire that all these 
people return. Of those that left, more than half have returned. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] What can you tell us about relations 
between Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy, especially over the 
irredeemable statements of the neo-fascists? 
  [Granic] Regarding Italy, it is a question of individual 
statements. We are closely following what is happening there. 
We want good relations with Italy, but we will not accept 
changes in the current agreements regarding the borders. We have 
a few minor matters that are still pending with Slovenia that do 
not affect our good relations. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] Moving to another topic, we have heard 
that 
you are successfully fighting inflation. 
  [Granic] Inflation reached 30 percent per month in 1993 and 
now we have reduced it to 0.1 percent. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] How did you achieve this? 
  [Granic] Through a balanced budget and a restriction in 
public spending. 
  [Vrljicak-Espain] Could it be said that you copied Argentine 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo? 
  [Granic] We are closely observing Argentina's economic 
program.

<F P=106> [By Guillermo Morales Cata] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 10 May (PL) -- People profiteering from 
medicine that is scarce in Cuban pharmacies had the rug pulled 
out from under them today when the Public Health Ministry 
announced a new strategy for the distribution and control of 
medicine. 
  Uncertainly has prevailed for months among the Cuban people 
regarding the fate of medical supplies, and Public Health 
Minister Julio Teja today outlined goals for this sector by 
proposing ways to turn back the difficult situation concerning 
the availability of medicine. 
  In addition to controls, the Cuban authorities intend to 
raise the national production of medical products and to give 
more support to herbal medicine, which, as is well-known, 
represents an international tendency to use medicinal plants and 
natural products. 
  Until recently, "transient dealers" were frequently seen on 
the island demanding exorbitant prices for medical products that 
are in high demand and, in fact, do not exist in state-owned 
facilities. 
  Although the country's situation is critical, the health 
minister explicitly referred to the allocation of convertible 
currency that will enhance imports in a much more efficient and 
independent way. 
  The government faces a dilemma concerning the possibility of 
purchasing approximately 352 medical products that are 
considered "essential" for people's health, but the creation of 
a new budget for this purpose seems to clear any doubts. 
  According to Teja, the pharmaceutical industry's production 
plan already has a sizable part of the raw materials, with an 
estimated value of 84 million pesos (on a par with the dollar at 
the official exchange rate), which represents an increase for 
this sector over last year. The goal is to match production 
levels reached in 1992, when the scarcity of medicine was not so 
critical. 
  Since 1959, the situation in Cuba's medical-pharmaceutical 
industry has always been a state priority. Before then, the 
national market contained more than 40,000 registered 
pharmaceutical products. More than 80 percent of these were 
manufactured by foreign firms, mainly U.S. firms. 
  The country's laboratories continued to purchase raw 
materials primarily from the United States, but, given that 
nation's dispute with the island, U.S. companies began to cut 
their supplies until they were completely suspended. 
  Despite the restrictions, Cuba's pharmaceutical sector has 
managed to manufacture, from start to finish and by using 
genetic engineering, medical products such as recombinant 
streptoquinate [estreptoquinasa recombinante], which prevents 
heart attacks; the first vaccine against type-B meningitis; and 
the epidermic growth factor. 
  The Patents and Licenses Office in the United States, the 
country which has obstructed Cuba's medical and biotechnological 
development for more than 35 years, registered three Cuban 
patents in 1993 alone. 
  The office recognized the originality of these products, and 
Cuba is the only country in the world that has the methodology 
and technology to manufacture them. 
  Regarding five future technologies, the Cubans are world 
leaders in the most important ones, biotechnology and genetic 
engineering, with an estimated market of $200 billion within six 
years. 
  Although the Cuban state places no restrictions on the 
protection of health assets, it does intend to grant priority to 
the distribution and control of medicine.

  [Text] Upon returning from Costa Rica yesterday, President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio was asked if the people responsible for 
the loss of food and medicine in Santo Tomas de Castillo would 
be punished and if charges would be filed against the health 
minister. The president reiterated that fighting corruption is 
one of his government's main objectives. He said: "If there is 
one thing my administration has tried to do from the very 
beginning, it is to combat negligence and violations of the 
country's laws." 
  The president added that the struggle against corruption is 
being conducted at all levels in his government, thus the law 
will be applied to anyone who has committed a crime. He 
recalled that the government's position has been reiterated 
several times, so those who are guilty of negligence must answer 
before a court of law and be punished according to the law. 
  President De Leon Carpio did not elaborate on the issue but 
clearly established that the government's position on the health 
problem is to minimize its negative effects on the population. 
  Political analysts have stated that the government must 
await 
the results of the investigation, which is headed by Deputy 
Health Minister Enrique Eugenio and expected to conclude in 15 
days, before any measures can be taken against the culprits.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis </F>
Galindo with unidentified reporters at the Los Capitales 
Nacionales Corporation in Panama City; broadcast in progress -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Lewis Galindo] ...I wish to thank Dr. Perez 
Balladares for choosing me as his foreign minister. This is a 
great honor for me because I am familiar with Perez Balladares' 
background. I am a close friend of his and worked in close 
association with him in General Omar Torrijos' time. We were 
part of Gen. Torrijos' inner circle or advisers. I wish to 
express my appreciation for this opportunity to serve Panama. I 
had already retired from business and public life. 
Nevertheless, I accept this call to serve the homeland with 
great energy. To serve my country at the Foreign Ministry holds 
a poignant value for me. My father held the post of foreign 
minister and struggled hard for the same cause that I championed 
through the Treaties that were signed in 1977. My father 
succeeded in having the Panamanian flag flown for the first time 
at the military bases in our territory. During the 
independence, my grandfather served the country in the same 
capacity. So, three generations have served the homeland in a 
similar way. 
  At this time, I wish to acknowledge publicly President 
Endara's honest management of the elections. President Endara 
made good his promise. He will go down in history as a great 
Panamanian. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the Electoral 
Tribunal's hard work. The way the vote counting was performed 
deserved the warmest praises from the foreign observers who 
witnessed the elections. The Catholic Church and the Justice 
and Peace Commission created by Archbishop McGrath played a 
significant role in persuading the Panamanian people that their 
votes would be carefully counted. More than anything else, these 
elections demonstrated the Panamanian people's lofty civic 
spirit. I will cooperate with Dr. Omar Jaen, who has been 
designated deputy foreign minister. I think I do not have much 
else to say about him. He is an intellectual of international 
prestige, a historian who has written Panama's history. 
Whenever he has had time, he has put it down in books, but he 
has always had it at hand in his personal computer. Welcome 
aboard, Omar. 
  I have been talking with Dr. Perez Balladares on priorities. 
As you know, he has set as his administration's priority to 
improve the Panamanian people's standard of living. To do this, 
it is necessary, first of all, to create jobs. 
  The Foreign Relations Ministry will be radically changed 
under the government of Ernesto Perez Balladares; that is, the 
Foreign Ministry will become a productive institution. 
Incorporating Panama into NAFTA is a similar priority we will 
pursue. This incorporation will let our products gain access to 
great markets in Mexico, the United States, Canada, and any 
other country that might join NAFTA. It is important for Panama 
to establish friendly and praiseworthy relations with the United 
States, relations that will allow us to obtain benefits and to 
gain respect. 
  With the reorganization of the Panamanian diplomatic corps, 
we will turn our embassies and consulates into agencies to 
promote investment and tourism as well as seek markets. 
Ambassadors around the world will have to obtain scholarships 
so our young people can be improved intellectually. I think it 
is a priority for the Panamanian people to raise their 
self-esteem. We must recover our international prestige, just 
as we did in Gen. Torrijos' time. Under the new national and 
international circumstances, it is mandatory for Panama to again 
be included among the respected and worthy nations of the world. 
It is important to improve our political and economic relations 
with all the nations of the continent and the world. We will 
attach special importance to improving our relations with Mexico 
and Peru. These relations have been a little on the downside. 
We will maintain excellent relations with our neighbors 
Colombia and Costa Rica. President [title as heard] Perez 
Balladares has been invited by President Gaviria and President 
Figueres to pay a quick visit to those countries and familiarize 
himself with problems of common interest. In addition, Perez 
Balladares has been invited by the governor of Puerto Rico, a 
very close friend of his. 
  It is important to stimulate our commercial relations with 
the EU, the Pacific Basin countries, and very particularly with 
Japan. All of those things lead us to plan the creation of a 
ministry of promotion. All of us Panamanians are proud when we 
travel abroad. We should strive so the name of Panama can be 
pronounced with respect. In particular, we will support 
President Cesar Gaviria in the reorganization of the OAS. It is 
important to stimulate better relations with the countries that 
use the Panama Canal. It is also important to inform them that 
the Panamanians will be capable of managing the waterway, which 
will soon revert to us. We should have some type of relations 
with the Eastern European nations that were recently liberated 
from the Soviet yoke. This will be done in due time, but it is 
also part of the list of priorities drafted in the few days that 
Perez Balladares and I have been working together. 
  As I said before, it is important to recover our 
international prestige. This can be done only by visiting those 
countries and letting industry, banking, and government leaders 
see the human quality of the team formed by Perez Balladares. 
It goes without saying that the persons he has in mind to 
appoint to positions in his cabinet are much more capable than 
myself. I am proud to be able to work with the people Perez 
Balladares has in mind for his government. I hope they will 
accept when the proposal is made to them. All of us must lend a 
shoulder to advance the homeland. 
  I will tell you something. I do not intend to stand with my 
arms crossed. I have worked hard to build my business interests 
through sacrifice and hard work. I have already spoken with 
Panamanian Ambassador to Italy Rodolfo Aleman to advise him that 
I will visit there during the month of June and expect to meet 
with all the Panamanian consuls in that country. At that 
meeting I plan to make them aware of what exactly we are 
seeking: investment promotion, Panamanian goods promotion, [word 
indistinct], and prestige for our country. Whoever is willing 
to keep up with this can be certain of my support, otherwise we 
will have to seek a replacement. 
  To me, it is important for all government officials to feel 
secure. I plan to respect the stability of all Foreign Ministry 
officials. It is important for us to create a climate 
comfortable to work in if we expect to increase efficiency. If 
an employee does not feel secure in his or her position, then 
efficiency and productivity falls. These are some of the 
guidelines I have been able to formulate so far. I would like 
to ask for your cooperation. We must all work hard. If we all 
work together, then I believe we will have a Panama we will all 
be proud of. 
  [Reporter] You mentioned changes within the Foreign 
Relations 
Ministry. Specifically, what type of transformations were you 
referring to? 
  [Lewis Galindo] We plan to transform the Ministry into an 
agency of promotion. Costa Rican President [Jose] Figueres 
appointed a commission to carry out a study related to 
restructuring his country's Foreign Relations Ministry. 
Everything I have heard so far about that study has been 
positive. Costa Rica has surpassed us with regard to promoting 
the country's business, tourism, in everything. So, I believe 
it would be worthwhile to take a look at what they did. 
  At this time I would not dare tell you what our 
transformation is going to be like. But one thing is for sure, 
we are going to have a transformation. We plan to transform the 
Ministry into an agency of promotion, in addition to maintaining 
cordial relations.... [pauses] I just cannot imagine an 
ambassador in Paris simply scratching his belly all year around. 
That man must produce, regardless of whether it is 
scholarships, investments in Panama, or promoting our products. 
How is it possible that while Japan and Korea sell us thousands 
of dollars worth of cars, and we have embassies over there, yet 
we are still trying to determine what to do with a product such 
as bananas because the European countries are setting up 
barriers? All of this is give and take. However, if the 
ambassadors simply sit around with their arms crossed and merely 
send.... [pauses] We will never accomplish anything if the 
ambassadors are persons who do not produce regardless of what 
positions they occupy, and we tend to reward them with an 
embassy, as we have done in the past, or simply because they are 
related to someone or some legislator. This is not going to be 
the case. 
  Panama will be represented by its most capable officials. I 
cannot fathom a foreign relations ministry under my direction in 
which I will be receiving calls from a country's foreign 
ministry requesting the withdrawal of a certain ambassador 
because he has spent his time illegally importing cars. That 
simply cannot be. We must be proud anytime we travel overseas. 
  [Reporter] What can you say about Panama's integration to 
the 
Central American Parliament [Parlacen]? 
  [Lewis Galindo] I would rather have the minister of planning 
and economic policy answer that question at a later date. 
  I personally believe that we have nothing to do with market 
integration in Central America. We can have cultural 
integration, but our business realm and wage scale do not match 
those of Central America. That is why I feel that what is more 
interesting for us is to think big -- let us associate ourselves 
with the three powerful northern countries. This does not mean 
we should hurt our relations with Central American countries; on 
the contrary. We have very basic economic differences. This is 
my personal opinion, and this topic is not my business, it is up 
to the planning minister. I am only giving my opinion as a 
businessman. 
  [Reporter] Could it not prove politically beneficial? 
  [Lewis Galindo] Politically? 
  [Reporter] To have the Legislative Assembly integrate 
Parlacen. 
  [Lewis Galindo] The Legislative Assembly.... [pauses] Well, 
the political side, fine. My disagreement is with economic 
integration. 
  [Reporter] The general commentary is that your return to 
public life, especially to the Foreign Ministry, is basically 
due to the transfer of the Panama Canal. There is word that due 
to your success with the treaty negotiations and your close 
relations with former President Jimmy Carter, and all the team 
that works with President Clinton, there is a possibility of 
negotiating a new base treaty. 
  [Lewis Galindo] President Carter is very respectful of 
Panama. He does not hold any official post in the U.S. 
Government. He has not spoken to me or anyone else about U.S. 
bases. This is a problem that I am sure we will discuss with 
the Americans in due course. But you can be sure that as long as 
I am foreign minister anything we do will take into account 
Panama's best interests and always with respect. As long as I 
am there and Dr. Perez Balladares is in the presidency, we will 
work and struggle for the recovery of our sovereignty. We will 
not give it away to anyone, but this does not mean that, if the 
study of the presence of U.S. military bases is required, I will 
oppose it. These then become not nationalistic issues, but 
cheap nationalistic issues. 
  Countries such as Spain, Italy -- powers with plenty of 
tradition -- have foreign bases there. Tell me where does the 
United States not have bases? We belong to the group of 
countries that make up the Western world; these barriers no 
longer exist. Perhaps one could argue whether the presence of 
U.S. bases is justified; up to now they have not done anything. 
I for one do not believe that we should make the first move and 
say: stay here, stay here. If the United States seriously needs 
the bases and is willing to talk to us, Dr. Perez Balladares has 
already said on several occasions he is willing to sit down and 
talk about the issue. 
  [Reporter] How do you feel about Cuba returning to the OAS? 
  [Lewis Galindo] Cuba is a very complex issue. Dr. Perez 
Balladares has issued statements in this regard, so I would not 
dare comment on this topic right now because it is a 
controversial topic. I would prefer to discuss this further 
along the line. This is a topic.... [pauses] We must wait for 
Dr. Perez Balladares to take office and then he can decide. For 
the time being I cannot say anything further on this because I 
am unaware of his opinion. 
  [Reporter] When will the elected president meet with 
Presidents Gaviria and Figueres? 
  [Lewis Galindo] In the next 15 days. In fact, we are about 
to send emissaries to coordinate the details of the visits. We 
will send them to both countries. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Lewis Galindo, going back to NAFTA. Could a 
renegotiation of the military bases give Panama an opportunity 
to reach Mexico's level regarding the renegotiation of the 
Treaties? 
  [Lewis Galindo] Well, that is part of a negotiation. We will 
open the negotiations. When one negotiates, ones does so with 
the cards on the table. They have their cards, we have ours. 
Let us see what they propose. We will open the negotiations 
and then see. But first we must get the three countries to 
negotiate with us. For this reason, it is very important to 
resume very friendly relations with Mexico and create a better 
climate between Canada and Panama. We must increase the degree 
of our relations with Panama if Canada and Panama are to be 
economic partners. First of all, however, we have to win over 
three countries before entering NAFTA. 
  [Reporter] Several Panamanians are in exile. At the Attorney 
General's Office several cases are pending. The extraditions of 
several individuals have been requested from several countries. 
Such requests have not been processed. Do you intend to follow 
up these cases? 
  [Lewis Galindo] Well, I do not know what it is all about. 
First of all, I must familiarize myself with these things. The 
government of President Perez Balladares is persecuting no one, 
however. I suppose that the legal procedures against people who 
have cases pending with the administration of justice by reasons 
of their offenses or crimes will have to continue. 
Nevertheless, this does not fall under my authority but rather 
that of the administration of justice. 
  [Reporter] Regarding the EU and the division of the 
countries 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Lewis Galindo] I think Spain owes us an opinion poll. We 
should talk with President Gonzalez and ask him to admit that 
the existing ties between the United Kingdom and its colonies 
and between Spain and its former colonies, such as the Central 
American countries, should be similar. The fact that we 
obtained our independence in the 19th century and that Jamaica 
and the other English colonies obtained theirs in the 20th 
century does not justify Spain neglecting its relations with us. 
We must have a powerful sponsor, such as Spain. We will 
eventually talk with our friend President Gonzalez and the 
Spanish authorities. I am sure that in this way we can strike 
some kind of arrangement favorable to Panama. 
  [Reporter] What can be done to have the U.S. Senate ratify 
the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty? 
  [Lewis Galindo] We must trust the Panamanian officials. U.S. 
senators do not trust Panamanian officials because we have given 
proof of scant seriousness and, in this case, they say: Since 
this is a two-way thing, we can give Panama certain information 
and it may end in the drug traffickers' hands. However, that 
can change and I think that with the attention that Perez 
Balladares will give all those problems we will recover the 
trust in Panama -- not only with the United States but also with 
the rest of the world. 
  You tune in a radio or television station in Paris speaking 
about Panama and the stations say Panama has just held elections 
and the country is one of the largest drug trafficking centers. 
This was told to me by a French banker who indignantly phoned 
me this morning. This government has done a number of good 
things but has overlooked reporting them. Consequently, 
Panama's prestige has dropped down low. As I said before, we 
must restore Panama's name to the level it had during Torrijos' 
time. 
  [Reporter] Do you belong to any one political party? 
  [Lewis Galindo] I do not actively participate in any one 
political party. Nevertheless, I joined and voted for the 
Solidarity Movement out of solidarity with my brother. He is 
the politician. I am a businessman and a retired one at that. 
I have been taken out of retirement to be put to work again. I 
wish to say something else. The door to the Foreign Ministry, 
headed by myself and Jaen, will remain open. Sometimes I am too 
frank and stick my foot in certain things. So help me not to 
because I am not too much of a diplomat.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 May (EFE) -- The government coalition in 
Bolivia is facing the immediate threat of losing one of its 
allies and being left without an absolute majority in Congress. 
  Max Fernandez, leader of the populist Solidarity Civic Union 
(UCS), whose deputies guarantee the government's absolute 
majority in Congress, harshly criticized President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada after threatening to withdraw his support. 
  So far the special session of Congress called for 9 May by 
Sanchez de Lozada has not been held, because the UCS, in a 
demonstration of force, has joined the opposition in boycotting 
the president's call. 
  Sanchez de Lozada "is worse than a dictator" said Max 
Fernandez, according to his remarks published by LA RAZON today. 
  The president "has no reason to tweak my ears, because I am 
not anybody's boy. I am a businessman and a person who deserves 
respect," said Fernandez, who is the majority owner of the 
National Brewery, one of the largest companies in the country. 
  Max Fernandez announced he will meet with Sanchez de Lozada 
in the next few days, assuring that "by God, it will be the last 
and definitive meeting between the president and myself." 
  Sanchez de Lozada, heading the Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement (MNR), won by a simple majority the 6 June 1993 
elections. 
  Thanks to a pact with the UCS, Sanchez de Lozada was elected 
president by Congress and was able to form a government 
coalition supported by an absolute congressional majority. 
  On several occasions Max Fernandez has expressed his 
dissatisfaction with his party's share of power in the 
government, and criticized the president for not consulting with 
him on important decisions before implementing them. 
  As a result of the government pact signed with the MNR, the 
UCS heads the Defense Ministry, some secretariats, and embassies. 
  The other MNR ally is the social democratic Free Bolivia 
Movement (MBL), whose seven deputies do not guarantee the 
government's absolute majority. The MBL runs the Foreign 
Ministry through its president [Antonio Aranibar] who is the 
cabinet chief and foreign minister. 
  The MNR has 52 of the 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 
and depends on the 20 seats of the UCS to have an absolute 
majority.

the military are not fulfilling the functions of federal

action is not against the strike, but against disorder and

<F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria has not regressed regarding 
the elimination of sanctions for personal drug use. Today, he 
warned the ruling of the Constitutional Court does not affect 
the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Today, the president of the republic, speaking at the 
General 
Santander National Police Academy, made categorical remarks on 
the elimination of sanctions for personal drug use. He said he 
does not agree with this decision because several fundamental 
rights are at stake, including the right to security and 
tranquillity of Colombians. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording in progress] ...who believe that 
the 
interpretation of Article 16 of our Constitution, which contains 
the right to personal independence, cannot be taken to extremes 
bringing us to an individualistic society. In this case, 
various rights come into conflict and the Court should have 
pondered the value of each right, should have tried to reconcile 
them, and should not have disregarded the rights to security, 
health, and tranquillity of Colombians. 
  The government believes that carrying and consuming drugs 
for 
personal use should continue to be prohibited. [end recording] 
  The president of the Republic concluded that severe 
restrictions will be adopted so that drug consumption will not 
take place in public places, schools, or universities, or so 
that drugs will not be consumed by minors, pregnant women, or by 
people doing jobs involving dangerous activities.

  [Excerpt] The executive branch has suddenly decided to 
replace retired General Marcial Samaniego, defense vice 
minister, for "sidestepping the appropriate bureaucratic 
channels" in proposing the dispatch of Paraguayan troops to join 
UN peace missions abroad. The news was confirmed by Defense 
Minister Hugo Estigarribia. Gen. Cesar Rafael Cramer was 
installed this morning, replacing Samaniego. 
  "Regrettably some bureaucratic channels, such as the 
president of the Republic and the foreign minister, were 
sidestepped. Gen. Samaniego, in eagerness and good faith, 
omitted going through these channels and committed the country 
on his own. The president then replaced him," the defense 
minister said, in explaining why Decree 3582 was issued. 
  Samaniego had spoken to the military person responsible for 
UN peace missions without communicating this to other state 
authorities. Besides, Samaniego also announced an Armed Forces 
"social action" plan in the country's conflictive areas, which 
was understood as a sort of sly and improper military 
intervention in domestic affairs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Peruvian mission charged with promoting Peru's 
good image abroad returned to Lima this morning after a 
successful tour of several European countries. Economy Minsiter 
Jorge Camet also returned from Europe, where he attended the 
World Bank consultative meeting in Paris, France. 
  Confiep [National Confederation of Private Businesses] 
Chairman Arturo Woodman praised the agreement reached with 
international financial institutions. 
  Economy Minister Jorge Camet asserted that the $1.1 billion 
in aid granted to Peru by the international financial community 
will be invested primarily in social programs. Upon his return 
from the World Bank consultative meeting in Paris, Camet said 
the letter of intent submitted by the Peruvian Government to the 
IMF reflects the reforms adopted by the executive branch with 
the objective of curbing inflation. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Walter Samuel Leiva] [words 
indistinct] are you satisfied and happy with the results 
obtained at the meeting? 
  [Camet] Yes, I am satisfied. 
  [Leiva] How will these funds be invested, sir? 
  [Camet] There are concessionary and normal loans totalling 
$850 million that will be used in infrastructure and social 
programs. We also have $250 million in donations. 
  [Leiva] What are the terms for these loans? 
  [Camet] Some of them are concessionary loans and others are 
normal loans -- in addition to the donations I have already 
mentioned. 
  [Leiva] In how many installments? 
  [Camet] Well, this is for the whole of 1994. 
  [Leiva] What are your comments on the letter of intent that 
the Peruvian Government has submitted to the IMF? 
  [Camet] Well, the letter of intent was drafted by the 
Central 
Bank and the Economy Ministry, and it reflects the government's 
economic reform program and the goals we intend to achieve: 
about a 20 percent inflation rate and a growth in reserves by 
$150,000, that is, more than $300 billion. [end recording] 
  Economy Minister Jorge Camet added that the current economic 
program will remain unchanged. He said there will be no changes 
because the government intends to continue curbing the inflation 
rate and eradicating extreme poverty in Peru. 
  He said the Peruvian business mission's European tour, which 
ended today, was very positive. The Peruvian mission was headed 
by Industry Minister Liliana Canale and Peruvian businessmen, 
among them Confiep Chairman Arturo Woodman.

<F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Calderon] </F>
  [Text] "To increase economic relations with the United 
States," for the purpose of "opening new paths for future ties," 
with Venezuela is one of the objectives of Ambassador Pedro Luis 
Echeverria. On Tuesday he appeared before the Senate's Foreign 
Relations Committee for approval of his designation as 
Venezuelan ambassador to the U.S. 
  The future ambassador explained relations between Venezuela 
and the United States are of a broad and diverse nature. One of 
the major elements of relations is the economic relationship. 
This economic relationship is evidenced by the export of energy 
products and nontraditional exports such as those manufactured 
by the state's basic enterprises, as well as investments by 
Venezuela and the U.S. in each other's economies. 
  Regarding the proposal that the envoy in Washington also 
hold 
the post of ambassador to the OAS and other international 
organizations with headquarters in that city, Echeverria replied 
it is worth considering. "I think the OAS will undertake major 
tasks in the coming years. It would be a great amount of work, 
but I think with good organization a well-structured embassy 
could handle those commitments in the future." 
  Although he supports the proposal to improve the expenditure 
structure abroad, Echeverria feels that under the current 
circumstances that cannot be done because the topics to be 
discussed in the OAS in the immediate future require the active 
presence of an ambassador.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August. 
  During a telephone interview, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution (PRD), admitted that the Mexico City branch of the 
PRD had engaged in irregularities in nominating its candidates 
to the Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District. He 
urged those involved to respect the party's mandates, and he 
said the mistakes could be corrected. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in 
Spanish 5 May 94 pp 1, 6) 
  Dr. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential candidate 
for 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), visited Chiapas 
State for the second time today. Dr. Zedillo visited the town 
of Tapachula, where he told those present that he wants the 
peace agreements with the Zapatist National Liberation Army to 
be signed to enable them to be fulfilled as soon as possible. 
Zedillo said it is "unacceptable" to have so many poor people 
in such a rich state. "We have to achieve social justice here," 
according to Zedillo. (Mexico City Radio ACIR in Spanish 0000 
GMT 6 May 94) 
  PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo has met with representatives 
of 
the National Network of Handicapped People in southern Mexico 
City. The representatives denounced the lack of opportunities 
for the handicapped in the areas of education and employment. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 11 May 
94) 
  The National Action Party (PAN) has asked the other eight 
political parties that will take part in the August elections to 
allow public audits of their campaign expenses, according to 
Felipe Calderon, secretary general of the National Executive 
Committee of the PAN. Calderon said the audits would serve to 
clear doubts over the campaign expenses of the PRI, which had 
reported expenditures of 24.515 million pesos as of 17 March.

  [Text] Nuevo Laredo, Tamps [Tamaulipas], 9 May -- The suit 
filed by the U.S. AFL-CIO against Magneticos de Mexico, a Sony 
subsidiary on this side of the border, for allegedly mistreating 
its workers is an attempt to hinder the implementation of NAFTA 
and the potential opening of new assembly plants in the country. 
  Ricardo Lopez Santos, president of the National Association 
of the Processing Industry (Canacintra), has criticized the 
"obscure interests" of the AFL-CIO and U.S. congressmen who want 
to capitalize on the problem and thwart the trade agreement. 
  The AFL-CIO suit was supported by 25 U.S. congressmen, 
headed 
by Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and Majority Whip David 
Bonior. According to the AFL-CIO, union delegates pressured 
workers of the Magneticos de Mexico assembly plant to vote 
against their favorite representatives. This suit reportedly is 
the second suit filed by the U.S. labor organization since NAFTA 
went into effect less than five months ago. 
  Lopez said: "They are expressing opinions on a problem which 
they know nothing about. They are trying to capitalize on it to 
halt the trade agreement and prevent other companies from 
opening businesses on the border because of an apparent state of 
violence." Lopez said that Sony did not pressure its workers. 
The plant facilities were blocked due to union rather than 
labor-management problems.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban authorities have taken measures against 10 
persons in Pinar del Rio and Sancti Spiriti, by virtue of the 
application of decree-law No. 149 that establishes the 
confiscation of property and assets of all those who have 
illegally acquired wealth. 
  An official of the Attorney General's Office explained that 
[words indistinct] and that such measures do not imply anyone's 
arrest. The same source added that decree-law No. 149 is 
established in chapters 60 and 61 of the Cuban Constitution. As 
of this moment, those persons accused of illegally gaining 
wealth have 10 days to demonstrate with authentic documents that 
the property in custody of the authorities was obtained legally. 
If this cannot be done, the Attorney General's Office official 
added, [words indistinct] if it is proven that the persons 
acquired their wealth illegally, the property will be 
transferred to the Cuban Government.

  [Text] Havana, 13 May (EFE) -- Cuban dissident Francisco 
Chaviano, who was arrested at his house on Saturday, has been 
accused of "revealing secrets" about state security, while 
continuing to undergo the corresponding investigation process, 
family sources told EFE. If at the end of the investigation, 
formal proceedings under this charge are begun, Chaviano might 
be sentenced to between seven and 15 years in prison. 
  His wife, Ana Aguililla, who was able to visit him today at 
the State Security offices, said "he has never worked with state 
secrets," emphasizing that "his work on behalf of human rights 
has always been public." She also said today that she sent a 
letter to President Fidel Castro to tell him she was not 
permitted to leave any books for Chaviano to read and that "that 
is unconstitutional." 
  Francisco Chaviano, president of the illegal National 
Council 
for Civil Rights in Cuba [Consejo Nacional de Derechos Civiles 
de Cuba], was arrested after a police search in which documents 
and part of the files of that organization were seized. The 
organization is mainly involved in investigating cases of 
"rafters" lost at sea. 
  Dissident sources contend that shortly before the arrest, an 
unidentified individual arrived at Chaviano's house and gave him 
a document, "which he did not even have time to read because the 
police stormed into the house and searched it." 
  Francisco Chaviano, 40, was a natural science professor at a 
secondary school when he tried to illegally leave the country 
aboard a vessel in 1989 and was given a one-year sentence.

  [Text] For the second time during the current seventh 
mandate of the local People's Government bodies, the process of 
having delegates present a progress report to their voters will 
take place in the nation's more than 13,800 electoral districts, 
during the months of May and June. This seventh mandate began on 
10 January 1993, when the Municipal Assemblies of the People's 
Government were installed. 
  Days back, the president of Cuba's parliament, Ricardo 
Alarcon de Quesada, sent a letter to these delegates. The text 
of this letter explains that this process is spread over a 
two-month period because of the experience of the preceding 
year. This will make it possible to schedule meetings in such a 
way as to permit attendance by the greatest possible number of 
cadres and officials of the administrative bodies of each place, 
as well as by delegates to the Provincial Assemblies and by 
deputies elected by those districts. 
  Alarcon's letter adds that this new progress report process 
has been conceived as a continuation of the effort increasingly 
to improve the method of tightening relations between delegates 
and their voters, and so as to explain the need to provide 
concrete and essential operational information to the people on 
the current situation and how to face it. Alarcon also calls for 
the people's participation in the effort to face the current 
situation and to support the measures that may be adopted in the 
quest for solutions. 
  Alarcon's letter concludes by saying that the meetings will 
follow the special sessions of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] and that we must do everything 
possible so that these meetings will help enhance the people's 
understanding of the need to take the necessary steps to 
streamline internal finances and to promote economic efficiency. 
  Everything seems to indicate that delegates and deputies 
from 
each municipality and province will have the appropriate 
scenario to promote these contacts with the voters of each 
district so that the progress reports will no longer be the 
classic rendering of accounts, which are often mechanical and 
tiresome, but a collective action of exchange of opinions, 
explanations, arguments, and information about the solutions 
found for current problems, and so as to resume the talks on 
agreements and declarations by the ANPP in its 1 and 2 May 
sessions. 
  The people in general will be able to support once again the 
announced proposals for internal economic and financial 
adjustment measures conceived as the most important steps taken 
over the past few years to maintain this process of social 
equity.

  [Text] Yesterday, a plenary of the Committees for the 
Defense of the Revolution [CDR] was held at El Caney 
Municipality where people in this area of Santiago de Cuba 
Province asked Division General Sixto Batista Santana to express 
to Fidel and Raul the assurance that they can count on them 
during this battle. 
  During the plenary, Esteban Lazo Hernandez, first secretary 
of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba, made a 
special intervention in which he pointed out the moment requires 
all the firmness of the revolutionaries; in that sense, he 
stated: 
  [Lazo] "That is the reason I say that we are in times of 
very 
profound thoughts that reflect the state of mind of 
revolutionaries, patriots, and Cubans. We must get everyone to 
join the battle. But let us not forget that during these 
difficult times we must win the battle with real revolutionaries 
and with patriots. We will not win this battle with the 
mediocre, with those who change sides, or with pessimists. This 
battle must be won by patriots. We must win this battle for the 
future of our fatherland." 
  In another part of his intervention, before members of the 
CDR in El Caney, Esteban Lazo said that despite the efforts made 
by the Revolution there is still ingratitude; he gave an example 
from the life of Jose Marti: 
  [Lazo] "Marti said to Gomez, when he made him head of the 
Liberating Army: I make you head of the Liberating Army knowing 
that you will accept; I can only offer you the sacrifice of your 
life and the possible ingratitude of men. Today, there is 
ingratitude, but above it is the honor of Cubans." 
  After talking about these realities, Lazo, who is also a 
member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed 
out that despite all the difficulties, our economy is beginning 
to recover. He gave specific examples. 
  [Lazo] "We have our refinery. How long was our refinery out 
of service? Today it is operating. That is an expression of 
recovery. Rente, which was producing between 37 and 38 
megawatts, is now producing 230 megawatts, and, by the end of 
the year, should have all its units ready to work. This gas 
plant that is near here [words indistinct]. How about the 
textile factory? We have established a plan with the Mexicans 
for producing approximately 18 million square meters. In other 
words, we are seeing a recovery in our economy." 
  These were comments made by Politburo member Esteban Lazo 
Hernandez, vice president of the Council of State, in a special 
intervention made at the plenary held with CDR members in El 
Caney, where, in the presence of Sixto Batista Santana, the 
application of decree-law No. 149 was affirmed.

  [Text] Cuban Communist Party Politburo member Maria de los 
Angeles Garcia has stressed the need to consolidate teaching 
methods in each school to achieve efficiency in the coming 
school period. On concluding in Havana the national meeting on 
teaching methodology in preparation for the next school year, 
she said that we must generalize the experience on joint 
methodological work and systematize that method to perfect 
relations among the province, the municipality, and the school. 
  Maria de los Angeles Garcia added that this meeting must 
verify the results of this method and see whether its 
implementation is advisable or not. She said that children and 
adolescents are also protagonists of the economic adjustments 
being adopted in the country and for this reason the teachers 
must explain to them the causes of these measures so that they 
may find the just answers to their concerns. 
  At the preparatory meeting for the next school period, Maria 
de los Angeles Garcia stressed the importance of increasingly 
linking the school with the family and the community. She added 
that informal education must be consolidated so that teaching 
will reach all young people, namely those who are under five 
years of age and are not going to the childcare centers. She 
added that the optimization process is beginning a special stage 
because there are many points that will require the effort, 
intelligence, and political touch of all in order to conclude 
successfully this stage. 
  She added that the evaluation of teachers must be an element 
of incentive, control, and differentiation of teachers, in 
addition to being just. 
  Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez Gutierrez also 
participated in the meeting in preparation for the next school 
period, and he also stressed the changes being made in the 
registration of students for adult education. He added that 
these changes are made in accordance with the current economic 
situation that must be changed. He said that appropriate 
measures are being adopted and will be released soon. 
  The education minister added that adult education cannot 
become a refuge of teachers who are not suitably trained to give 
classes in those centers, and for this reason they must be given 
further training in education. 
  He added that English teachers must be trained further to 
give classes in high schools, where they are most needed, 
perhaps more than in the language schools.

  [Text] The participation of the family and the school in 
attending to today's social problems and to the education of 
young people needs to be more profound, and more systematic 
action needs to be taken, said Politburo member Maria de los 
Angeles Garcia at the eighth plenum of the National Social 
Prevention and Attention Commission. The participants at this 
meeting said that now is the time to confront, rather than 
discuss, problems and to take cooperative action to solve them. 
  The newspaper GRANMA's report on this matter adds that the 
meeting also assessed the work of its institutions in 1993; 
employment of leisure time; and, especially, social phenomena 
associated with tourism, and the family and social complacency 
that sometimes accompanies the manifestations of such phenomena. 
The plenum also analyzed elderly care. It is studying a 
specialized program at the polyclinics that aims to benefit the 
elderly.

  [Text] The enormous potential in using the crude oil 
extracted in Varadero in waterproofing road surfaces and 
maintaining road infrastructure has been analyzed and discussed 
at a national workshop held in Matanzas. 
  Specialists and professionals from all over Cuba gathered in 
Matanzas and met in two committees: one on waterproofing; one on 
road maintenance. This gathering was chaired by engineers Jesus 
Perez Othon and Ramon Rodriguez, respectively first vice 
minister of Basic Industry and first vice minister of 
Construction. 
  Perez Othon discussed the current situation of Cuban heavy 
crude and the possibilities for making deliveries to 
construction enterprises. Rodriguez, for his part, talked about 
the need to generalize experiences with using Cuban crude 
because the results are very good if these experiences are 
properly applied, if the proper technical controls are observed. 
  The results in waterproofing road surfaces in Matanzas have 
been very good. Matanzas has been applying what is known as 
Varadero Asphalt for over 15 years now, and these experiences 
are already being successfully implemented in other provinces, 
like Havana City Province. 
  The road infrastructure must be repaired and given 
maintenance immediately, and Cuban crude is being used on 
stretches of the central highway, such as the stretch of road 
linking Camaguey and Ciego de Avila. This product is also being 
used to repair the Via Blanca, and it will be used to (?tackle 
the potholes) in the cities. 
  Upon closing this event, engineer Jorge Revuelta, vice 
minister of Construction, said all the nation's provinces will 
have to work hard at using Cuban crude, and that the technicians 
of the different provinces will seek better variants so as to 
become more efficient and improve quality.

  [Text] Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres has called on 
workers in the southeastern region to maintain their pledges to 
fulfill their current harvest goals. Heavy rains have been 
disrupting the progress of the harvest in this part of the 
nation and were the main reason for the poor results achieved in 
the last 10 days. 
  [Torres] "The order is clear: We are to continue fighting 
and 
have to grind the very last cane to extract the maximum sugar." 
  In Guantanamo, Torres chaired the 10-day progress meeting in 
the southeastern region, where the host province surpassed the 
neighboring provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Granma. 
  Torres acknowledged that the sugar harvest is the most 
difficult task within the sugarcane production program. Cuba's 
goal is to exceed by several hundred tons last year's harvest, 
which failed to produce approximately $450 million of income to 
Cuba. The persistent rains have now added to the known 
difficulties in the southeastern region. 
  [Torres] "We can no longer ask for the same results as those 
that were expected in other times; but we can look for the 
maximum, the variants, to grind with the most efficiency 
possible." 
  In this 10-day harvest progress meeting, Havana Province 
cane 
harvesters were praised for reaching their sugar production 
goal. Also stressed at the meeting was the necessity to maintain 
an elevated planting rate to ensure increased production in the 
next harvest. Guantanamo Province announced that, by the end of 
May, it will be the first to reach its spring planting program 
of 180 caballerias.

  [Text] Today, Politburo member Nelson Torres, who is also 
sugar industry minister, congratulated workers at the Jose Maceo 
bulk sugar terminal in Boqueron, Guantanamo Province for the 
terminal's designation as the most efficient in Cuba since the 
beginning of the sugar harvest. 
  This terminal, located right next to the Yankee naval base, 
had profits of $125,000 during the first four months of 1994 as 
a result of its prompt dispatch of ships. To date, the 
terminal's port workers have loaded some 20 ships from different 
countries, and have earned $1.05 in profits for every ton moved, 
which is more than twice the income earned during the last such 
identical period.

<F P=106> ["Science and Technology" section by Eduardo Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Cuba has stood out in its participation in the 12 
projects included in the program for the development of nuclear 
science and technology in Latin America. Such were the remarks 
of Dr. Daniel Cordorniu, vice secretary of the secretariat of 
nuclear affairs, during a recent news conference. 
  Next week, a meeting will be held in Bogota, Colombia, by 
the 
regional cooperation agreement program [programa arreglos 
regionales cooperativos] for the development of nuclear sciences 
and technology in Latin America, in which our scientists will 
play an important role. 
  The secretariat of nuclear affairs carries out hundreds of 
projects for the use of these techniques in the diagnosis, 
prevention, and healing of human and animal diseases, animal 
nutrition and reproduction, the creation of new varieties of 
useful plants, the rational use of fertilizers, the detection of 
defects in construction, oil drilling and extraction, studies in 
environmental contamination, nuclear safety, and many other 
areas. 
  In November, our country will host two regional workshops on 
advances in the use of nuclear energy, the development of 
radiopharmaceuticals, and on the final meeting of the Latin 
American project for the use of nuclear energy, which for five 
years has given nations of the region access to advanced 
technologies in this field. 
  Only four Latin American countries are pursuing research in 
this field: Cuba, with almost 200 entities that use nuclear 
techniques; Brazil; Chile; and Venezuela. It is for that reason 
that, despite pressures and the Yankee blockade, our country was 
welcomed into the Latin American section of the American Nuclear 
Society, which in July will hold its annual meeting in 
Argentina. This important meeting will include a roundtable in 
which, for the first time, the situation of the nuclear power 
plants in the region will be analyzed in a multilateral approach. 
  Dr. Daniel Cordorniu also announced that efforts are being 
made to establish an economic association that will allow 
resumption of the work at the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant.

  [Text] Current issues of concern for the population were 
discussed today at the plenum of the National Social Prevention 
and Attention Commission. One of the issues discussed was 
actions against social phenomena that degrade moral values. 
Female and male prostitution, streetwalkers, and pimping were 
terms that gave rise to comments stressing the need for legal 
support and repression to punish these activities closely tied 
to tourism. The effectiveness of recent police operations to 
preserve an orderly society were also acknowledged. On the other 
hand, it was mentioned that the solution to the problem ought to 
lie in prevention and in teaching the youth in school to 
repudiate socially sanctionable behaviors. 
  In workshops being conducted in several provinces, students 
are found to have a noncritical and, of course, tolerant 
attitude due to a lack of information. This reaffirms that the 
home must take on an increased level of involvement and 
responsibility. 
  Among the issues discussed by the commission were community 
efforts in youth recreation and praise for the accomplishments 
attained by the People's Councils working closely with 
political, cultural, and sports organizations. There are already 
18 discotheques nationwide and several more will be opened this 
year; there will also be a significant increase in youth clubs. 
  The care of people with mental problems was also discussed 
and it was clear that even though the Cuban state, with scarce 
resources right now, gives priority to these cases, the legal 
responsibility for the mentally ill lies with the family, which 
in certain cases relinquishes their care. 
  The plenum of the commission discussed very contemporary 
issues which generally cause concern to the population. It was a 
very up-to-date and down-to-earth plenum.

  [Text] The Ministry of Basic Industry's Electric Union has 
announced that the deficit in electricity will continue this 
week and will be similar to what it has been to date, but with a 
slight increase on 14 and 15 May because a unit from the Carlos 
Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant in Cienfuegos will go 
off-line. 
  The Electric Union also announced that the parts needed for 
repairs to the thermoelectric plants in order to stabilize 
generating capacity are continuing to enter the country. 
  At the present time, the maintenance program is progressing 
well and the generating capacity is gradually being increased; 
the average deficit is 25 percent lower than last April's.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments carried by Cuban media in 
Spanish between 9 and 13 May: 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 May reports that a small gold 
mine in Pinar del Rio is expected to yield approximately 300 kg 
of gold this year. The mining complex uses Brazilian technology 
and employs over 100 workers. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 10 May reports that 1,630 
caballerias of tobacco in Pinar del Rio will be financed by the 
Spanish Tobacco Company. The southern part of Pinar del Rio 
Province, including San Luis and Consolacion del Sur 
Municipalities, was chosen by the Spanish Tobacco Company for 
financing in a project that will bring in hard currency. The 
financing is excellent because Cuba can use the money however it 
deems necessary -- e.g., for fertilizers, herbicides, shoes, or 
clothing -- so as to ensure that the land produces maximally. A 
local official said the financing will be repaid in tobacco. 
  Radio Reloj at 1400 GMT on 11 May reports that workers from 
the Sergio Soto Refinery in Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province, 
have produced, experimentally, the first few tons of oil for 
electric transformers. This will mean a substantial contribution 
to the national economy. This oil, produced from crude extracted 
from deposits in the vicinity of Cristales and Pina, is 
essential for electric transformers. The Sergio Soto Refinery 
also produces other important petroleum by-products, such as 
basic oil. 
  Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 
12 May report that following significant improvements, the 
Hermanos Diaz Oil Refinery in Santiago de Cuba has attained a 
production capability that allows this refinery to take up the 
slack while the Nico Lopez Oil Refinery in Havana undergoes 
general maintenance. 
  Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 11 May reports that potato 
production in Pinar del Rio Province increased by 30,000 
quintals in 1994 as compared to 1993. More than 203,000 quintals 
have been harvested. According to the Pinar del Rio Province 
Agriculture Ministry office, the country's cold-storage 
facilities contain enough potatoes to supply the population for 
the rest of the year. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 12 May reports that there are 
approximately 10,000 self-employed people in Matanzas Province, 
or 15 percent of the national total. "Of these 10,000 people, 60 
percent are men; 2,000 are women; 2,000 are retirees. Some 1,500 
of the women are housewives, and almost 5,000 people are current 
job-holders." There are approximately 100 applications for self- 
employment permits weekly. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 13 May reports that since its 
reorganization, Cubanacan Incorporated has a new transport 
company called (Veracuba). The report adds that the transport 
management in 1993 obtained an income of more than $13 million 
and projects an income between $16 and $17 million in 1994. This 
will represent an increase of between 20 and 25 percent over the 
same period the previous year. Thus, after six years of work, 
the company has achieved an increase of between 30 and 40 
percent. The new company is prepared to provide more and better 
services with a very young, efficient, and trained personnel who 
can speak several languages. 
  In the same newscast Radio Rebelde reports that 140 houses 
have been built in Holguin to shelter agricultural and livestock 
workers. These are the first of 1,000 houses to be built in the 
province this year. The report adds that tobacco production is 
expected to increase by approximately 40,000 quintals in Pinar 
del Rio. In Camaguey sugarcane workers intend to plant 1,765 
caballerias during May. The report concludes by announcing a 
plan for the construction of seven small hydroelectric plants in 
Granma Province to increase current generating capacity by 11.6 
megawatts/hour.

  [Text] Brasilia, 13 May (DPA) -- In a communique released 
in this capital, which is currently hosting the "pro tempore" 
Secretariat of the Group of Rio, a bloc of 13 Latin American and 
Caribbean countries, the group announced today that it will not 
acknowledge the appointment of a provisional president in Haiti. 
  In the communique, the Group of Rio states that "the Haitian 
crisis can be resolved only if unrestricted respect is shown for 
the Governor's Island Agreement which calls for the prompt 
return of Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide to the 
exercise of his constitutional powers in Haiti. The communique 
urges "the de facto authorities who illegally hold power in 
Haiti to submit to the UN and OAS decisions which mirror the 
firm hope of the international community." 
  This Latin American group's reaction came two days after the 
military leaders of Haiti made Emile Jonassaint provisional 
president of Haiti, following the Haitian Parliament's 
declaration that the post was vacant. 
  Jonassaint's rise has been interpreted as a sign that the 
Haitian military is not considering yielding to international 
pressure or sanctions and is not about to fulfill the Governor's 
Island Agreement which acknowledges President Aristide, who was 
overthrown in 1991, as the legitimate leader of Haiti.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "180 Minutes of News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] According to Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom, 
the conditions are not right in Venezuela for a guerrilla 
resurgence. The minister denied that a guerrilla movement in 
response to the country's situation. He said the Americo Silva 
Guerrilla Front was the last rebel organization of its kind to 
exist in Venezuela since the sixties. The minister also 
expressed his satisfaction with the Front's decision to adopt a 
legal, democratic coexistence. 
  Regarding the student disturbances of the past few days, 
Escobar Salom called on the protesters to reflect and to 
advocate change without disrupting peace and by preserving 
tranquillity. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] I want to impress upon the various 
social sectors that violence is not going to improve this or any 
other problem. The government, therefore, while it favors this 
democratic dialogue, wants to emphasize to Venezuelan society 
the necessity of peaceful coexistence. That is the government's 
purpose, and it is also the government's purpose to strongly and 
firmly confront, as it is doing now, the disturbances, 
aggressions, and attacks on citizens' rights. The government 
must defend the rights of all citizens and cannot allow minority 
groups to attack the social peace and rights of others: the 
right to have property and the right to own or rent a vehicle, 
bus, or truck, as is the right of Venezuelan workers, so they 
can circulate freely and peacefully on the streets, avenues, or 
highways. [end recording] 
  Minister Escovar Salom said the situation is totally under 
control and emphatically affirmed that the government will deal 
harshly and unhesitatingly to control these incidents, which in 
his opinion do not compromise the country's political or 
institutional stability. 
  The truth of the matter is that the famous sinister force 
which Minister Escobar Salom accuses of being the main motor of 
the student disturbances has thus far not appeared and its 
whereabouts are unknown.

<F P=106> [Report by Alexander Barrios from the "180 Minutes of News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Colonel Ramon Moreno Natera, second permanent 
military judge of Caracas, will head a military court 
investigation into the student disturbances in Caracas. Heavy 
shooting took place inside the Central University of Venezuela 
[UCV] on Thursday following almost five hours of student 
disturbances in the street near the university that leads to 
Venezuela Plaza. There was machine-gun and light automatic 
weapon fire at approximately 1845 on Thursday evening. Two 
fragmentation grenades were thrown at the numerous members of 
the Special Metropolitan Police Brigade posted around the 
university premises. The demonstrators fired on water trucks and 
riot vehicles, hitting them over 30 times during the heavy 
shooting that came from inside the UCV. 
  According to Emilio Delgado, who was in command of the 
Special Metropolitan Police Brigade, the individuals--who might 
be termed subversives--used light automatic rifles, machine guns 
with tripods, and fragmentation grenades. Judge Ramon Moreno 
Natera may conduct an on-scene inspection of the metropolitan 
police vehicles hit and of buildings surrounding the UCV, such 
as the bridge over the Francisco Fajardo freeway. 
  It was also learned that Carlos Luis Hernandez, 21, who has 
a 
criminal record for homicide, was arrested following the heavy 
shooting. He will be turned over to the Judicial Technical 
Police and will later be remanded to the orders of the 2d 
Permanent Military Court of Caracas, because the weapons used in 
the shooting presumably belonged to the national Armed Forces.

  [Text] Caracas, 13 May (Notimex) -- There was concern in 
Venezuela today due to reports of a plot to stage a coup d'etat 
against the administration of President Rafael Caldera, who is 
facing growing social unrest. 
  Newspapers assert that Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, 
leader of the coup attempt in February 1992, has reported that 
ranking military officers are planning a coup d'etat. 
  The report, published in an EL NACIONAL column, pointed out 
that the Caldera administration and the economic and political 
elite are perfectly aware of the situation and that they even 
have the name of a military leader who may be involved in the 
conspiracy. 
  According to columnist Alfredo Pena, Armed Forces officers 
told Chavez Frias that a coup d'etat would be staged by high 
command members and that the Interior Ministry has been 
informed. This is the first rumor that Caldera's administration 
has had to deal with, added to which are the remarks of Defense 
Minister Rafael Montero, who said today that Venezuela is on the 
verge of a civil war. 
  Although his remarks would seem to point to the armed 
attacks 
on policemen during a demonstration at a university campus, 
analysts have not dismissed the possibility that Montero's 
assertion had some other connotation. In the opinion of analyst 
Alfredo Pena, "it is all very confusing, and the government 
should remain alert. The economic, fiscal, and financial crises 
have caused widespread anger among the people, but an 
insurrection would not be justified. [no closing quotation mark 
as received] 
  Pena added that the Executive has made serious mistakes in 
the handling of the crisis it inherited from the social 
democratic administrations of the past 10 years, but that does 
not justify the rejection of all attempts to resolve such a 
serious problem. 
  Deputies from the opposition Radical Cause Party (CR) and 
the 
Movement Toward Socialism requested a thorough investigation to 
determine the veracity of Chavez's report and, in any event, to 
reveal the names of the people responsible for the plot. 
  Alfredo Pena said that a military coup at this time would 
unleash a series of actions and reactions out of fear and that 
there would be a blood bath "because in Venezuela there is no 
chance of a plain coup." 
  In contrast, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said 
that, 
despite the wave of student demonstrations that degenerated into 
riots and plunder during the week, for the time being there is 
no possibility of a coup d'etat. 
  According to the EL NACIONAL columnist, "there are civilian 
instigators" who are taking advantage of the wave of marches, 
which are also to protest against the high cost of living and 
the lack of services.

  [Text] Tapachula (Mexico), 15 May (EFE) -- Today, 
journalists reported that a bomb damaged a section of railroad 
tracks a few kilometers from Tapachula, Chiapas State, 1,300 km 
south of Mexico City. The explosion destroyed 10 meters of 
track and left a hole 2 meters wide, interrupting railroad 
traffic. 
  Soldiers and federal and state judicial police arrived on 
the 
scene and established area controls while National Railroad of 
Mexico personnel inspected the route for other bombs. 
  The Army arrested a group of people from Central America who 
were near the site of the explosion -- four Salvadorans, seven 
Guatemalans, and one Honduran -- who remained under judicial 
police arrest. 
  Nearby residents said that the bomb was homemade and that it 
was intended to destroy a nearby bridge, although authorities 
are still examining what was left of the devise.

<F P=106> [By Candelaria Rodriguez and Jose Antonio Roman] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 9 May -- This evening, 
the state government pledged to compensate cattlemen and rural 
producers by paying 4,500 new pesos for each of the 21,220 
hectares in the area of the conflict. The amount represents a 
"rental payment" that covers from January to 31 October this 
year, based on the terms of the peace accord. 
  The sum will serve as compensation for the effects of the 
armed rebellion without involving a sale of land. This measure, 
it was said, responds to proposals made by Chiapas livestock 
producers. 
  The agreement signed this evening between the cattlemen's 
leaders and Governor Javier Lopez Moreno includes private land 
and ejidos and deals with damages to the land so far. They 
agreed that the arrangement will be reviewed upon its conclusion 
from the perspective of the peace accord that is currently under 
negotiation. 
  Following a march by cattlemen from Altamirano, Las 
Margaritas, and Ocosingo Municipalities to demand that state and 
federal authorities comply with the agreements signed 20 days 
ago in the presence of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
Governor Lopez Moreno decided to meet the protesters' demands 
with an allotment from the state's own funds. 
  The state official signed the agreement with cattlemen 
leaders Jorge Constantino Kanter and Jose Francisco Lopez 
Ardines, who agreed that landowners will receive 4,500 new pesos 
for land that cannot be tilled because it is within the area 
involved in the conflict. The figure will be multiplied by 12 
percent annually for the 225 estates fully registered in the 
area. The payment to these estates "is like a rental payment 
for those affected between 1 January and today and for 
subsequent months." 
  Fidel Culebro Trejo, president of the state's Rural 
Producers Federation, said the agreement does not involve any 
land sales. He added: "It is like a rental payment on the 
land's value." 
  The following individuals signed the agreement on the state 
government's behalf: Jaime Mantecon Solis of the Rural 
Development and Ecology Secretariat; Rodolfo Ulloa Flores, 
general government secretary; Nestor Aguirre of the Agrarian 
Reform Secretariat; and Carlos Arroyo Rincon, assistant 
Agricultural and Water Resources Secretariat delegate, among 
other authorities. 
  To implement the agreement, the state government pledged to 
establish offices in the municipal capitals of Ocosingo, 
Altamirano, and Las Margaritas. The offices will register each 
of the estates located within the zone involved in the conflict 
once the requested stipulations have been met. 
  Rural producers must submit requests to the governor for 
inclusion in the program, which begins tomorrow, at offices that 
will accept applications between 11 and 31 May. These offices 
will only register affected estates in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and 
Las Margaritas Municipalities. 
  State authorities will forgive, through the Finance 
Secretariat and on this occasion and for this zone only, taxes 
levied on the issuance of a tax clearance certificate. State 
officials will perform the appropriate analysis as soon as the 
requested documents arrive so they can immediately proceed with 
the payment. 
  The Rural Development and Ecology Secretariat will be 
responsible for establishing the aforementioned registry 
offices. Enrique Moscoso Thomas, who has been named the program 
coordinator, will verify that the work is carried out 
expeditiously and without creating problems for owners and state 
officials. 
  Referring to land occupations, the agreement states that "we 
will abide by the 60-day deadline specified in the agreement 
made with the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations 
(CEOIC) in Mexico City." 
  Once occupied lands are recovered, evaluations will be made 
to see that damages are repaired within the state government's 
normal programs. Once an agreement is signed between the 
parties, rural cattlemen and producers will reportedly vacate 
the city's civic square and downtown area, which they closed off 
throughout the day. The demonstrators will reportedly return to 
their communities this evening.

  [Text] Upon signing the Agreement to Coordinate Public 
Security Operations in 1994, a program in which the government 
will invest 226 million new pesos, Government Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo said that in view of attempts to weaken the state, it is 
time to strengthen the unity of all Mexicans and utilize the 
vitality, strength, and creativeness of the institutions. He 
stated: "Among Mexicans, there can be no enmity, only 
adversaries." 
  Carpizo explained that the resources granted in the 
agreements signed by the Government Secretariat and state 
governments are intended to improve the quality of the police 
force by training personnel in the most modern and scientific 
methods of investigation. 
  Carpizo stated: "Let me speak clearly. Public security is a 
state responsibility. Mexico's public security policies must be 
improved because this is a permanent commitment to the nation 
and with the law. That commitment rejects illegal actions. It 
requires our public security corps to remain current, permanent 
protection of our constitutional order and full respect for 
liberty, human rights, and the guarantees supporting these 
rights." 
  The government secretary signed the agreement with 29 
governors and the Mexico City mayor. The governors of Baja 
California and Tamaulipas, Ernesto Ruffo Appel and Manuel 
Cavazos Lerma, were not present but sent representatives to the 
meeting. The agreement was signed within the framework of the 
National Public Security Program. The ceremony took place in the 
Revolution Room of the Government Secretariat. 
  Carpizo said it is necessary to uphold and improve 
conditions 
that provide assurances, calm, and public security, all of which 
are indispensable to promoting national development. Carpizo 
explained that the federal government and the states must act 
"responsibly," especially in view of calls for improved public 
security without infringing on any constitutional guarantees. 
  The secretary explained that the idea is to reaffirm the 
legal system and to strengthen conditions that nourish civilized 
life, order, and public peace within the framework of respect 
for rights and liberties. 
  The ceremony was also attended by Mexico State Governor 
Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, who said Mexico has recently endured 
violence which a majority of the people undoubtedly rejects. He 
said "crime has tarnished our coexistence." According to him, 
the country wants better public security so the state can 
function legally. 
  Chuayffet Chemor said all sectors view insecurity as an 
offense, so when it is occasionally the result of negligence or 
abuse of authority, distress turns into indignation. 
  He added that the federal government has responded promptly 
to public security demands and noted: "The federal entities 
want to fight violence, crime, and the confusion between 
legitimate claims and arbitrary attempts to impose particular 
interests on the majority." 
  The state leader said more policemen are needed to fight 
crime. This increase in forces is not meant to cause concern in 
society but to bring it serenity. He added that "the community 
expects promptness and efficiency from the people who serve it 
by fighting those who would offend and endanger the community. 
The people demand assurances and expect no reduction of the 
freedom we all enjoy. They ask for a stern hand to enforce the 
law but say there can be no justification for abuse and 
excessive power under any circumstances." 
  Jacques Rogozinsky, general director of the National Bank of 
Public Works and Services (Banobras), announced that his 
organization designed a financial plan to modernize the public 
security system equipment. The plan's objective is to support 
the states in purchasing vehicles for their preventive police 
and judicial organizations. He explained that the funds for 
these vehicles will be funneled to the various states through 
Banobras, which will be responsible for providing the vehicles 
themselves. The federal government will contribute 25 percent of 
the total cost of the units, while loans will provide the 
remaining 75 percent over three years. 
  Rogozinsky went on to explain that five assembly plants will 
be invited to bid. The bank will require a "unit cost and 
discount reference list" for all vehicles and other equipment, 
which will be a determining factor for all participants. In 
addition, the bank will establish a "volume discount rate per 
unit," which must be applied by all qualifying participants. 
  Socorro Diaz, undersecretary of civilian protection, crime 
prevention, and social readaptation, said the funds will be used 
to upgrade the organization and operations of the public 
security forces in each state, including private security 
agencies, weapons for the police force, communications 
equipment, and other materials used for training and to preserve 
order.

  We hereby respectfully address you to invite you to come to

Presidency who wish to meet with us. All we ask is that you 
publicly declare that you and your party are receiving nothing 
from us for this visit, that you have not paid us, in money or

<F P=106> [Commentary by Juan Molinar Horcasitas, researcher at </F>
National Autonomous University of Mexico's Social Research 
Institute: "A Hard Test"] 
  [Text] The criminal charges that the National Action Party 
(PAN) has filed against Professor Carlos Hank Gonzalez represent 
a tough test for the government as the elections approach. If 
the government succeeds in passing it rather handily, it will be 
very instrumental in creating the appropriate conditions so that 
the 1994 elections do not wind up surrounded by suspicion and 
recrimination. But if the government fails this exam, it will do 
severe damage to the elections and cast a dark shadow over their 
integrity and impartiality. PAN's charge is that Carlos Hank 
Gonzalez and his private secretary violated Article 407 of the 
Federal Penal Code. This article prohibits public servants from 
using whatever funds, assets, or services they have at their 
disposal to support a political party or candidate. 
  According to the official PAN charge, which carries on 
through legal channels what the national press began in the 
media, Carlos Hank used resources from his secretariat to place 
a full-page insert in all national newspapers in support of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential candidate. 
The evidence that PAN has submitted to back up its charge 
apparently includes copies of documents that were issued by the 
office of Mr. Hank's private secretary and that mention 
conversations which the agriculture secretary had with several 
well-known figures to drum up support for the PRI candidate. I 
have no way of knowing whether these documents constitute 
sufficient evidence to bring the accused before a criminal 
court, but what is clear is that broad segments of public 
opinion have enough evidence to believe that Mr. Hank is indeed 
guilty of the charge. 
  Naturally I do not claim that what counts in the press will 
also count before the public prosecutor, much less before a 
judge. But I do not find it acceptable either that the Attorney 
General's Office should dispense with the matter by simply 
shelving it, inasmuch as there are sound legal and political 
reasons why this matter ought to be treated seriously. 
  Legally speaking, the Attorney General's Office ought to 
take 
up the matter and rule whether there are sufficient grounds to 
bring criminal action against the accused individuals or against 
whoever may turn out to be responsible. In that case, the 
consequences would not be at all minor, because the law 
describes the crime quite clearly and provides for a fine of 
between "200 and 400 days pay and one to nine years in prison." 
  This harsh law puts all of the people involved to a severe 
test. I am sure that Carlos Hank is not at all afraid of the 
fine, but I do think that the prospect of a year in jail bothers 
him. And in this instance the judge cannot opt for the easy way 
out because the law says that the penalty consists of a fine and 
jail time. To make things worse, the final section of Article 
407 of the Penal Code itself says that "release on bail shall 
not apply in the case of this crime." 
  The political pressure will be mostly on Attorney General 
Diego Valades, of course, but it could extend to electoral 
authorities as well, especially the Federal Electoral Institute 
(IFE), because although it does not have specific authority to 
conduct the corresponding criminal investigation, it does have a 
political and legal interest in the case. Article 82 (Section 
"v") of the current election law says that the General Council 
of the IFE has the power "to ask the General Executive Board to 
investigate, with the means at its disposal, incidents that 
significantly affect the rights of political parties or the 
electoral process." The case at hand obviously affects the 
electoral process because a high-level official of the federal 
government has been implicated in the commission of an electoral 
crime. As a result of this law, we can expect a loud debate on 
the matter during the next session of the General Council of the 
IFE; this could well be the last session of the current council 
or it could mark the debut of the new one, which has already 
been constituted by its new members, who will apparently take 
charge of the final stages of the electoral process. 
  Moreover, the crime of which Carlos Hank is accused also 
affects the delicate political negotiations that have been 
taking place over the past few months. If the authorities do not 
offer a convincing response to the charges that have been filed 
and if they do not proceed fairly, they will be proving right 
those who accuse the government of being unwilling to organize a 
clean election. 
  The opposition's reaction is understandable, since the crime 
involved is not a minor one. The offense does not consist of the 
improper use of a few faxes or of a few hours of the highly 
valuable time of senior officials and civil servants to whom 
taxpayers pay splendid salaries. The offense does not even 
consist of the huge cost of inserting the document of support in 
the press, if it was in fact paid for with public funds. 
  The offense, if it is proved to exist, would consist of the 
violation of a criminal law by a senior government official. It 
would also consist of a flagrant violation of the government's 
repeated promises to hold clean elections. In this regard, it 
jeopardizes the country's political stability. So then, it is an 
offense against the opposition parties in particular and against 
society in general, especially at a time like this when a failed 
election would be a disaster of enormous consequences for the 
country. 
  It would be even worse if these already severe offenses were 
compounded by impunity. The potential political advantage of 
appeasing a justifiably annoyed opposition should not prompt us 
to convict the defendants before a serious investigation and, if 
appropriate, a fair trial. It is very wrong to use scapegoats. 
Likewise, however, we must not acquit the defendants without 
conducting the investigation that justice demands and without 
proceeding to the appropriate trial, inasmuch as the privileges 
of powerful, untouchable officials and authoritarian impunity 
are also very wrong. Therefore, the attorney general must take 
legal action in response to a serious charge. Therefore, Carlos 
Hank Gonzalez and his private secretary must answer this serious 
charge legally and politically.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu's foreign policy 
seeks the removal of Brazilian subsidies on milk--subsidies that 
harm our interests. He has already lodged the appropriate 
diplomatic protest. Negotiations with Argentina over the signing 
of an agreement on the dredging of the Martin Garcia channel 
have been enhanced. Other very important issues like border 
agreements to remove environmental pollution and the pollution 
of border rivers like the Cuareim River, the Yaguaron River, and 
the Merin Lake will be discussed with the Brazilian foreign 
minister and the Rio Grande do Sul governor during a meeting to 
be held within the next few days in the city of Canela. 
  Minister Sergio Abreu and a small group of advisers 
yesterday 
held a working breakfast with journalists to thoroughly inform 
them of the developments of current diplomatic work and 
negotiations, not just with the neighboring countries, but 
specially with the EU, Mexico, the United States, and Canada. 
  The meeting served to become better acquainted with the 
development of all these important issues and to confirm the new 
style implemented by Abreu in his role as the "manager of our 
foreign policy," as he described his activities at the Foreign 
Ministry. A basic element of his activities involves "developing 
our land and river borders" with Brazil and Argentina. 
  Abreu discussed the recent GATT conference, the results of 
which were unsatisfactory for many countries. This was called 
the Uruguay Round. It took more than seven years to complete. 
  He pointed out that even though no concessions were received 
directly from the great powers, positive results were achieved 
laterally and a trade war which would have had "regrettable 
consequences for the entire world" was prevented. 
  Abreu specifically discussed the developments of a Rio Group 
meeting held in Sao Paulo during which the member countries 
agreed to enhance their relationship with the EU. In a brief 
review, he mentioned the new international political agreements 
on security issues, the new OAS policy and the election of the 
OAS secretary general, and especially the relationship with the 
political blocs of Asia where Uruguay has been enhancing its 
presence and its direct relationship policy. 
  The foreign minister harbors no doubts that all countries 
were dissatisfied with the GATT results. Nevertheless, there is 
a greater willingness to negotiate--a willingness that did not 
exist before--following the inclusion of groups that were not 
GATT members. This represents the beginning of a multilateral 
approach for a global trade relationship that used to be 
governed by group agreements. This involves a new relationship, 
even though it does not include the agricultural and 
livestock-producing countries. The current protectionist 
apparatus will be dismantled within six years, following the 
closure date of the Uruguay Round. [passage omitted] 
  A proposal that is still being studied by the area countries 
seeks to link Alaska with Tierra del Fuego. This proposal 
aroused great expectations among NAFTA countries and countries 
from other existing blocs. It is similar to the new European 
Union which has been developing with internal problems that 
include an extremely high unemployment rate, growing economic 
recession, and the need to increase its area of influence 
following the socialist collapse. 
  The foreign minister emphasized that the EU's firm goal is 
to 
reach our area through Mercosur [Common Market of the South] to 
which it ships a significant quantity of manufactured products 
and from which it receives agricultural products and raw 
materials. 
  Another significant point is that 40 percent of the banks 
operating in Latin America are European. [passage omitted] 
  Discussing Argentina's initial contact with NAFTA--which 
Argentina intends to join--Abreu emphasized that it is 
impossible for Argentina to join NAFTA because the current rules 
prevent it and because Argentina would have to grant all the 
advantages to the other ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association] and Mercosur countries. Discussing increased trade 
in the Mercosur area, Abreu emphasized that trade grew from $3 
to $9 billion, which gives an idea of the dynamics among the 
four member countries. Brazil was the great beneficiary of this 
trade growth. 
  The foreign minister emphasized that a protest has been 
lodged with the Brazilian Foreign Ministry over the attitude on 
tariff reductions for milk and milk by-products. This represents 
a clearly competitive attitude that is harmful to other Mercosur 
partners, as in our case. 
  A response is expected within a short period of time. The 
foreign minister believes it will be favorable to our claims. 
Otherwise, other negotiations that are under way may be delayed 
and our producers, who have already been warned about all this, 
may be harmed. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the particular issues Uruguay has pending with 
its 
two neighbors, Abreu briefly pointed out that a contract for 
dredging the Martin Garcia Channel will be signed within a few 
days and notes on the advanced payment of the binational Salto 
Grande hydroelectric dam project will be exchanged soon. The 
issues pending with Brazil include the Cuareim and Yaguaron 
Rivers and the Merin Lake, the cleaning up of the cities linking 
our two countries, environmental protection, and the joint 
development of the Merin Lake and Yaguaron River basins and a 
new bridge linking Rio Branco with Yaguaron.

  [Text] San Jose, 14 May (ACAN - EFE) -- A violent clash 
between police and workers of the Geest Caribbean banana company 
in Sarapiqui, 130 km north of San Jose, left over 35 people 
injured on 13 May. Strikers threw stones at policemen, injuring 
16 of them. The police returned fire and wounded 19 workers, 
three of them seriously. The police also arrested 33 workers in 
the clash, which began when they evicted the workers from the 
farms where they had been on strike for a week. 
  Approximately 1,000 Geest Caribbean company workers were 
preventing the police from clearing roadblocks on the roads 
leading to the banana farms. The workers hurled rocks to repel 
the police's attack, who returned fire with guns and tear gas. 
  Security Minister Juan Diego Castro justified the police 
action and said he gave the workers a deadline to lift the 
roadblocks before the police would evict them, but "all efforts 
to convince them were in vain." A correspondent for the daily 
LA NACION, who witnessed the incident, said 150 workers clashed 
with approximately 200 riot police "marching in closed formation 
toward a roadblock erected by the workers." 
  "The police loaded their M-16 rifles and got the tear gas 
grenades ready while the strikers awaited the troop's advance, 
rubbing together in their hands the stones they would later hurl 
at the police, the daily reported. [no closing quotation mark as 
received] 
  Union spokesman Jorge Barboza told ACAN-EFE that the labor 
unrest at Geest Caribbean began in April when the company cut 
wages up to 50 percent in some cases and then dismissed over 200 
workers of the Union of Agricultural, Livestock, and Related 
Trades Workers of Heredia (Sitagah), a union the company does 
not recognize. Barboza added that the strike, which has entered 
its eighth day, is intended to recover wages and achieve the 
reinstatement of 200 workers fired by the company, "which was 
preparing to dismiss a similar number of union workers." 
  The Geest Caribbean company issued a communique stating that 
"the strike is an unjust protest" and explained that it does not 
recognize Sitagah, which heads the strike, "since it is not a 
registered union, therefore the company cannot negotiate with 
people who do not represent the interests of Geest workers." 
The company granted the workers' representation to an 
association of blue-and white-collar workers, which, according 
to the communique "groups 65 percent of the company's workers." 
  Barboza said "the workers have decided that the union will 
represent them, and the company must accept that decision." He 
also announced that they are preparing, with support from the 
International Labor Organization, a labor rights violation 
complaint. Barboza noted that all the dismissed workers belong 
to Sitagah and said the company intents to "rid" itself of 
unionized personnel. He added that the workers are ready to 
negotiate a solution to the conflict.

<F P=106> [Report by ``special correspondent'' Kang You-feng in San </F>
Jose from the "Hookup" program] 
  [Text] At a joint news conference held by Republic of China 
[ROC] President Li and Costa Rican President-elect Figueres, 
President Li said he has a dream of transferring state power to 
another person in a peaceful manner during his lifetime. He 
said this would be his happiest wish. Meanwhile, President Li 
also called on Communist China to establish the system of the 
peaceful transfer of state power based on the concept that 
sovereign authority rests with the people. 
  Especially to express high respect and courtesy, Costa Rican 
President-elect Figueres held a joint news conference attended 
by the heads of state of both ROC and Costa Rica. Owing to the 
fact that the transfer of state power from the old president to 
the new president in Costa Rica will take place soon, reporters 
from various countries who are going to cover the presidential 
inauguration ceremony all seized the opportunity to attend the 
news conference. The site of the news conference was crowded 
with people. 
  When a reporter asked President Li about his views on the 
democratic politics in Costa Rica and the enlightenment of Costa 
Rica's democratic experience, President Li pointed out that in 
recent years, Costa Rica has been a very democratic country 
because all systems of the country are based on the concept that 
sovereign authority rests with the people. In particular, the 
transfer of state power from the old president to the new 
president is being carried out peacefully. People will not feel 
uneasy because of the transfer of state power. 
  At that time, when President Li noticed that there were 
XINHUA reporters present, he switched the conversation to 
another subject and pointed out: The biggest problem in 
mainland China is how to find a successor. We can understand, 
after examining democratic politics in several countries, that 
we must establish a system to ensure a long period of political 
stability. Establishing a good system is the basic way to 
ensure a long period of political stability. President Li said: 
  [Begin Li recording] The sovereign authority rests with the 
people. This sentence is not new. In fact, however, it is also 
a new concept. Are representatives of mainland China here, too? 
Think about it! The biggest problem in mainland China is how to 
transfer state power to a successor. Please see that only 
people elected by the people can represent the will of the 
people. Our current goal is to improve democratic construction, 
which is precisely to establish such a system. [words 
indistinct] [end recording] 
  At this point, President Li emotionally said he has a dream, 
which is not to transfer state power after his death. If 
possible, he will transfer state power peacefully to another 
person during his lifetime. He said that this is his happiest 
wish. 
  [Begin Li recording] I have a dream. That is, if there is 
such an opportunity, I shall transfer state power to another 
person. This will be my happiest wish. In China, our ROC, no 
president has ever transferred power to another person during 
his lifetime. I hope that our society [words indistinct] will 
not have such problem. This is why I said that sovereign 
authority rests with the people. Meanwhile, our constitional 
reform is precisely for this purpose. Only in this way can the 
state achieve stability. To develop the country, we must have a 
stable foundation. [end recording] 
  After President Li spoke about sovereign authority resting 
with the people under democratic politics and the establishment 
of a political system to ensure a long period of political 
stability, reporters from the Xinhua News Agency also expressed 
their views to ROC reporters that President Li's remarks are 
quite right and that China needs a scientific system and must 
not continue the past way of a certain person designating a 
successor. Su Chih-cheng, head of the secretariat of our 
presidential office, who accompanied President Li on his visit, 
also told the XINHUA reporters that President Li's remarks all 
were words from the bottom of his heart and he expressed his 
hope that they could reflect and report fully President Li's 
remarks.

  [Text] Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro 
has criticized the various organizations and individuals who, 
under the pretext of foreign aid and the peace agreements, are 
pushing for the ratification of constitutional reforms. 
Yesterday, Gutierrez Castro said some reforms have been approved 
"not because Salvadorans agree with them but because the UN 
secretary general has expressed his concern." 
  "We must be a sovereign nation and find a way to become 
financially independent to keep others from trying to manipulate 
us under the guise of international aid. "Anyone with 
light-blue eyes feels entitled to recommend reforms here," 
Gutierrez noted. "We must stop being cowards because cowards 
are always intimidated. As long as we continue to lack moral 
courage and a high concept of our nationality, we will have to 
live under pressure." 
  Asked about President-elect Armando Calderon Sol's trip to 
the United Nations, where he will reportedly reiterate his 
government's commitment to comply with the peace agreements, 
Gutierrez Castro said that he himself could not raise political 
criticisms against Calderon Sol. He added, however, that it 
would be ruinous for Calderon Sol to commit to compliance with 
recommendations made in the Truth Commission report because they 
"are illegal, arbitrary, and deceitful." Gutierrez Castro 
asserted that "if I had to go to the United Nations, I would go, 
but I would not say that I am going to comply with those 
recommendations." 
  On 11 May, Gutierrez Castro presided over the inauguration 
ceremony of the First Specialized Regional Seminar for Lawyers, 
Judges, and Military Judge Advocates: Human Rights in the Armed 
Forces. The event was held at the Camino Real Hotel and 
sponsored by the Inter-American Human Rights Institute's Program 
for the Armed Forces and Police, the Spanish Defense Ministry, 
and the Salvadoran Defense Ministry. 
  Political analyst Kirio Waldo Salgado said the Legislative 
Assembly must avoid foreign pressure. "We are tired of dealing 
with unfair constitutional measures on the last day of 
congressional sessions," he stated. Salgado said that 
"democracy in El Salvador is subject to the U.S. Government, 
which dictates reforms in this country." He added that the 
deputies must legislate on behalf of the Salvadoran people, not 
for the international order.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 13 May (NA) -- A tear gas grenade 
exploded this morning in the Rio de La Plata Building, where the 
Japanese Embassy has its offices, in repudiation of the Japanese 
refusal to grant a visa to soccer star Diego Maradona. Three 
people were injured. The explosion occurred just after 0830 
[1130 GMT] when embassy employees opened the door to the offices 
on the 9th floor. 
  According to Alberto Crescenti, director general of the SAME 
[expansion unknown], the explosion at Paseo Colon 279 caused eye 
problems and suffocation to the following: Roberto Blanco; 
Carlos Catalano, 23; and Andrea Vousou, 22. The three were 
quickly taken by ambulance to the Algerich Hospital in La Boca 
District where it was determined that their injuries were not 
serious. 
  Pamphlets with the slogan "Down with Japan, lay off 
Maradona," of the Revolutionary Organization (ORP) were found in 
the building. This shows that the attack was in reprisal to the 
Japanese Government decision to not grant Maradona a visa. 
[passage omitted] 
  One employee told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS: "It is all very 
strange because the building has a contracted security 
organization in addition to the embassy security guard. 
Therefore, it is very difficult to understand how the grenade 
could have been planted in the building." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
has stressed that relations with the United States are currently 
"the best they have ever been." He said Argentina "is showing 
its potential to the world." 
  Menem recalled that bilateral relations had run into "an 
infinite number" of problems, just as they do with other 
important nations, but stressed that beginning with his 
government, "an immediate decision was made to change course by 
implementing more realistic policies at both the national and 
international levels." Menem said this last night while opening 
American Week at the Pacifico Mall in Buenos Aires. U.S. 
Ambassador James Cheek participated in the ceremony. 
  The chief of state reiterated that Argentina must be "among 
the top 10 countries in the world because it has the necessary 
natural and human resources." He emphasized, "We must not forget 
that after having been among the world's top 10 countries some 
40 years ago, we slid to 100th position in 1989." He stated: "It 
has been difficult to overcome the innumerable obstacles that 
hampered Argentina's escape from stagnation, frustration, and 
involution." 
  The president stressed that "an enormous apparatus that 
sought to frustrate had been mounted" in the country, 
"converting it into a nation of favor trading and privileges 
because the state dominated and did everything unsatisfactorily." 
  Defending his state reform policy, Menem highlighted the 
fact 
that "after five years, Argentina has moved from 100th place to 
16th place among the economic powers." He said, "Argentina must 
once again be among the top 10." 
  Menem admitted that "not everything is right" in the 
country. 
He justified this saying that other stagnated nations "needed 
decades to revert the situation while we took just 5 years." 
Menem said, "No matter who governs, by the end of the century we 
will be much better off if we continue on this course." 
  The chief of state indicated that enhancing the current 
policy "is the best proposal for the current stage and for 
advancing against the scourges that affect us and the rest of 
humanity." 
  Menem defined these "scourges" as "poverty, drug 
trafficking, 
terrorism, and crime, which actively grow through new methods." 
He said: "The proposal for new laws and a more coherent 
relationship among all nations is the best answer to these 
scourges which undermine our best foundation: An organized 
society." 
  More than 40 recognized U.S. enterprises are participating 
in 
the event. The opening ceremony took place in the center of the 
mall where a 12.5-meter model of the Statue of Liberty, which is 
located in New York harbor, has been erected.

<F P=106> [Report by Silvia Odoriz] </F>
  [Text] Ashkhabad, 13 May (EFE) -- Argentine Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella today ended a two-day visit to 
Turkmenistan, where Argentina has significant investments. He 
expressed full support for the political independence of this 
former Soviet Republic and for its economic reforms. 
  Di Tella concluded his stay in Turkmenistan with a one-hour 
meeting with Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov, with whom he 
discussed political and economic issues. 
  During a news conference, Di Tella said the political issues 
discussed with Niyazov focused on Argentina's support for the 
independence of Turkmenistan. 
  Di Tella noted: "We were among the first countries to 
recognize the independence of Turkmenistan, because we believed 
it was fair." 
  Niyazov, who received 99.9 percent of the votes in a 
plebiscite held in January -- a plebiscite that allows him to 
extend his tenure until the year 2002, and which prevented the 
holding of new presidential elections that had been scheduled 
for 1997 -- today presented to his country's parliament his 
economic reform program for his country, including agricultural 
reform that involves land privatization. 
  Indicating that the political and economic reform programs 
announced by Niyazov "seemed good to him," Di Tella said: "Now 
it is also necessary to support economic reform." 
  The Argentine foreign minister admitted that "every country 
has to maintain its own rate of reform" and that, however 
desirable it might be to institute reform immediately, "it must 
be assumed that transformations need to take place at a rate 
that societies can accommodate." 
  Di Tella noted that "reaffirmation of the economic reform" 
is 
a key point now, as it represents one of the pillars of the 
future Turkmenistan. He added that along with this 
transformation, "political reforms" will take place "slowly, but 
firmly," and this is more important than any spectacular 
measures. 
  Concerning bilateral issues, the foreign minister pointed 
out 
that "we talked in particular about the presence of Argentine 
companies involved in giant projects" like Bridas, linked to the 
oil industry field, and Lybra, linked to the production of sugar 
and other industries. 
  Upon pointing out Bridas' goal of participating in ambitious 
projects such as the construction of gas pipelines linking this 
central Asian republic with Turkey, Europe, and Pakistan, and 
gas prospecting in Turkmenistan, Di Tella said: "I believe that 
in this case the old proverb that business creates friendship 
and friendship creates business is correct." 
  The foreign minister also mentioned the industrial projects 
of the other Argentine company operating in Turkmenistan. 
  Di Tella, who was feted today with a luncheon by Turkmen 
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov [title as received], 
this morning visited the Kaakhka area, where Lybra is 
constructing a sugar mill and an alcohol distillery that within 
one year will be able to process 30,000 metric tons of sugar per 
year. 
  Lybra executives Francisco Gradin, Pablo D'Agnillo, and 
Francisco Cordella joined Di Tella and his entourage, including 
high-ranking Foreign Ministry officials, Argentine businessmen, 
and Juan Carlos Olima, the Argentine ambassador to Russia and to 
other former Soviet republics, for the visit to the sugar mill, 
whose construction in the middle of the desert requires a huge 
logistical deployment. 
  Lybra's investments in Turkmenistan total $230 million. The 
company, which specializes in the construction of industrial 
"turnkey" facilities, is involved in nine projects in this 
central Asian country. Lybra directly or indirectly employs 
1,200 people in these nine projects. 
  Di Tella was feted last night by Bridas President Carlos 
Bolgheroni in a building that is part of a housing project 
developed in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital, for Bridas 
personnel in Turkmenistan. 
  Thus far, the oil company has invested $168 million in 
drilling two oil wells in prospecting for gas in Yashlar, about 
450 km east of Ashkhabad, and is exploiting 38 oil wells in 
Keimir on the Caspian Sea. These oil wells currently yield 
1,400 metric tons of crude oil per day. 
  Bridas is employing 616 people in Turkmenistan, of whom 236 
are Argentines and people from other nationalities, including 
Europeans, Latin Americans, and U.S. nationals, 316 are Turkmen, 
and 64 are people from other former USSR republics.

<F P=106> [Text of Law No. 26301 on the application of Habeas Data] </F>
  [Text] Law No. 26301 
  CONSIDERING THAT: 
  The Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] has approved the 
following Law: 
  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC 
  Hereby decrees: 
  Article 1. Until a specific Law on the subject is dictated, 
any petition concerning the Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee 
mentioned in Clause No. 3 of Article No. 200 of the Constitution 
may be heard, at the plaintiff's choice, by a lower civil court 
of either the venue where the plaintiff resides; or of where the 
mechanical, automatic [telematicos], magnetic, informatic, or 
similar records are located; or of the venue corresponding to 
the address of the defendant, irrespective of whether the 
defendant is an individual or a corporation, a public or private 
company. 
  If the violation of rights stems from court records, be they 
of a jurisdictional, functional, or administrative nature, no 
matter where and how they are stored, the case will be heard by 
the respective Civil Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice, 
which will appoint a lower court judge to handle the procedure. 
The lower court will then hand down the first ruling in this 
case. This same precept will apply to functional or 
administrative archives of the Attorney General's Office. 
  Article 2. The court ruling will merely order the 
publication 
of the rectification requested by the plaintiff, who must have 
attached the wording of it to his original petition. If he fails 
to do so, the court will offhandedly dismiss the petition. The 
rectification--which must be reasonable and proportionate to the 
offending article--will be published free of charge within three 
days after the ruling has become final. Failure to do so will 
result in violation of the law. 
  Any disagreement regarding the rectification, its 
proportionality, and its content will be decided on by the 
corresponding judge or civil chamber of the Superior Court, 
after hearing the defendant within three days. The judge must 
correct or restrict the requested rectification whenever it 
entails a rebuttal or viewpoint that surpasses the limits of a 
mere rectification. Although the aggrieved party may appeal, the 
ruling will stand until it is reversed by a higher court. 
  Article 3. Provisions applicable to Laws No. 23506, 25011, 
25315, 25398, and Decree Law No. 25433, and everything referring 
to the right of Amparo, with the exception of the provisions of 
Article No. 11 of Law No. 23506, will be applicable to the 
Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee in case of procedural 
loopholes. 
  Article 4. The provisions contained in the above articles 
will also be applicable to the constitutional guarantee known as 
Action of Compliance that is mentioned in Clause 6 of Article 
200 of the Constitution until the appropriate implementing law 
is promulgated. In this case, the provisions contained in 
Article 11 of Law 23506 will be applied when necessary. 
  Article 5. In addition to what is provided for in Article 27 
of Law 23506 and supplementary instruments, a petition for a 
Compliance Action Constitutional Guarantee will require the 
following prior steps: 
  A. In the case of a habeas data petition based on Clauses 5 
and 6 of Article 2 of the Constitution, the request should first 
be made through a notary public no less than 15 calendar days in 
advance, with the exceptions provided for in the Constitution 
and in the laws. 
  B. In the case of a Habeas Data petition based on Clause 7 
of 
Article 2 of the Constitution, the request should first be made 
through a notary public no less than five calendar days in 
advance of the publication of the corresponding rectification; 
and 
  C. In the case of an Action of Compliance, the request will 
be made through a notary public to the pertinent authority 
asking him to discharge what is considered to be his duty under 
the law, or the fulfillment of the appropriate administrative 
action or undertaking no less than 15 days in advance. Honoring 
this request will not exempt the official from his 
responsibilities under the law. 
  Article 6. A request concerning the Habeas Data 
Constitutional Guarantee will be directed against the legal 
representative of the respective institution or corporation, 
except when the action is directed against an individual. In the 
latter case, the individual will be summoned directly without 
this having any bearing on the provisions of Article 12 of Law 
25398. 
  To this end, legally constituted media organizations, 
irrespective of the type of communication used--whether oral, 
written, radio, press, or television--can name a Special 
Judicial Representative, through a notarial deed, who will have 
the full right, on the merit of his naming, to the powers 
outlined in Articles 74 and 75 of the Civil Code, and no pact to 
the contrary could be used to interfere with these powers. He 
will be empowered to act in the name the media that has been 
summoned or in the name of its editors, officials, journalists, 
or employees in general even if they have been summoned as 
individuals. The individual that is summoned by name will be 
held legally accountable for his action. 
  The appointment of the special judicial representative need 
not be registered in the public rosters, and his actions will be 
fully valid, even though his naming has been previously revoked, 
until the appropriate court or chamber has been informed of this 
fact. 
  The authorization to empower a judicial representative will 
also be extended to the actions pertaining to crimes against 
honor (defamation, insult, or slander) when the crime is 
attributed to a media organization. 
  Article 7. The Constitutional guarantee of the Action of 
Compliance will be directly attended to by the official or 
agency in charge of the required action. If the agency or 
official could not be identified, or if there is no certainty as 
to who should attend to it, the action will be directed to a 
more senior superior without prejudice to what has been 
established in Article 12 of Law No. 25398. 
<H5>  Temporary Provision </H5>
  A. Habeas Data petitions filed before the present law 
becomes 
effective, on which no ruling has yet been handed down by a 
judicial authority having a different specialty from the one 
described under Article 1 of the present law, will be officially 
and under liability turned over to the civil first instance 
judge who was on duty on the date the request was filed; 
  B. Habeas Data petitions that had been filed before the 
present law becomes effective, and rejected by a final judicial 
ruling, will have full effect. Those petitions on which no final 
ruling has been passed will be turned over to the judicial 
authority hearing those cases pursuant to what has been 
stipulated in the above paragraph; 
  C. Habeas Data petitions approved by a final judicial ruling 
issued by a judicial authority other than the one indicated 
under Article 1 before the present law becomes effective will 
continue with its procedure before the said authority. These 
petitions will be dealt with and settled pursuant to the rules 
of procedure set forth for a writ of Amparo and the present law 
pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 of this law. 
<H5>  FINAL PROVISION </H5>
  The present law will come into force on the day subsequent 
to 
its publication in the EL PERUANO DIARIO OFICIAL. 
  Let it be known to the President of the Republic for its 
publication. 
  In Lima, 18 April 1994. 
  Jaime Yoshiyama 
  President of the Democratic Constituent Congress 
  TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC 
  Hence: 
  I order it to be published and enforced. 
  Given at Government House, in Lima, on 2 May 1994.

  Constitutional president of the Republic

<F P=106> [Text of citizens participation rights law, promulgated in </F>
Lima on 2 May] 
  [Text] Law No. 26300 on the Right of Citizens to 
Participate and to Exercise Control 
  The Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] has enforced the 
following Law: 
  Title I 
  General Provisions 
  Chapter I 
  On the Right of Citizens to Participate and to Exercise 
Control 
  Article 1. This law regulates the exercise of the right of 
citizens to participate and to exercise control in line with the 
Constitution. 
  Article 2. The following are citizens' participation rights: 
  a. to propose initiatives for amending the Constitution; 
  b. to propose initiatives for creating laws; 
  c. to participate in referendums; 
  d. to propose initiatives for creating municipal and 
regional 
mechanisms; and, 
  e. to engage in other participation mechanisms that are 
provided for in this law for regional and municipal governments. 
  Article 3. The following are citizens' control rights: 
  a. to cancel officials' designations; 
  b. to dismiss officials; 
  c. to demand the rendering of accounts; and, 
  d. to engage in other control mechanisms that are provided 
for in this law for regional and municipal governments. 
  Article 4. The request to begin a procedure must be filed 
with the electoral authorities. The request will be accompanied 
by the corresponding proposed initiative and a list of the 
names, identification card numbers, signatures or fingerprints 
of those who sponsor the initiative, as well as their common 
domicile for the purpose of the initiative. 
  Article 5. The electoral authorities will establish how 
physically disabled citizens who cannot sign, or illiterate 
citizens, will exercise their participation rights. 
  Article 6. After receiving a request for initiation of the 
procedure, the electoral authorities will check the authenticity 
of the signatures and will issue the appropriate certificates. 
  Article 7. The citizens' participation and control rights 
referred to in Paragraphs d. and e. of Article 2, and in 
Paragraph d. of Article 3 of this law, and the referendum on 
regional and municipal regulations, will be regulated by the 
organic laws of regional and municipal governments. 
  Chapter II 
  On the Presentation of Initiatives 
  Article 8. If the signatures and if the subscribers' right 
to 
vote in the corresponding electoral district in which the 
initiative has been proposed are found to be within the law, the 
electoral authorities will issue a resolution granting the 
citizens' request and including in it, as appropriate, the text 
of the project if the initiative has regulations, the background 
report accompanying the proposal if the initiative seeks to 
cancel officials' designations or to dismiss them, the list of 
questions in case of a request to render accounts, or the 
regulatory matter that will be subject to a referendum. 
  Article 9. The sponsors of the initiative may designate 
representatives before every electoral organ to witness and 
supervise all the steps of the process. 
  Article 10. If after checking the list of subscribers, their 
number fails to reach the minimum value, the sponsors will have 
an additional period of up to 30 days for completing the list 
with the requested number of subscribers. 
Title II 
  On Specific Regulations 
  Of Proposed Laws 
  Article 11. All proposed laws consisting of one or more 
draft 
bills, accompanied by the certified signatures of no less that 
0.3 percent of all voters, will be granted preferential 
treatment by Congress. Congress orders its publication in the 
official gazette. 
  Article 12. The right to propose the drafting of laws 
encompasses all subjects with the same limitations that 
legislators have on tax and budget issues. The proposed law is 
drafted in a bill format. 
  Article 13. Congress drafts and votes on the draft bill 
within a 120-day deadline. 
  Article 14. Those who sponsor the proposed law can appoint 
two representatives to argue and defend it before the 
congressional drafting committees and, if the case warrants it, 
before the reviewing committee. 
  Article 15. If there are one or more draft bills on the same 
subject as that proposed by citizens, they will be grouped 
together. This, however, does not mean that the authority of 
those who sponsored the proposal or who represent it is 
disavowed. 
  Article 16. Draft bills rejected by Congress may be 
submitted 
to a referendum in compliance with this law. Moreover, if 
sponsors believe that prior to its approval the law has suffered 
substantial modifications distorting its main objectives, they 
may request a referendum to consult citizens on its approval. 
  Chapter II 
  On Proposed Constitutional Reform 
  Article 17. The right to propose the partial or complete 
reform of the constitution requires the support of 0.3 percent 
of all voters. 
  Article 18. A constitutional reform proposed by citizens 
must 
abide by the same rules of procedure established for bills 
proposed by legislators. 
  Article 19. Any proposed constitutional reform curtailing 
citizens' rights established in Article 2 of the Peruvian 
Constitution is inappropriate. 
  Chapter III 
  On the Removal and Dismissal of Authorities 
  Article 20. Citizens are empowered to remove from office the 
following officials: 
  a. Mayors and Government Magistrates [Regidores]; 
  b. Elected regional officials; 
  c. Elected civil servants. 
  Article 21. Citizens are empowered to remove elected 
officials from office. It is inappropriate to remove them during 
the first and last year of their government term, except elected 
judiciary officials. 
  A request for removal concerns a specific official. The 
request must be argued but need not be proven. 
  The National Election Board will call a referendum, which 
must be held within 90 days of the formal filing of a request. 
  Article 22. A referendum will be held in a constituency if 
25 
percent of its constituents, with a maximum of 400,000 
signatures, file a request with the appropriate office in charge 
of electoral proceedings for the removal of one of their elected 
officials. 
  Article 23. The removal will take place if an affirmative 
vote by the absolute majority of the constituents so decides. 
Otherwise, the authority on whom the removal from office has 
been referred to popular vote will remain in his/her post. A new 
request can only be filed two years after said vote. 
  Article 24. The National Election Board will appoint the 
runner-up on the same party's ticket as the official who has 
been removed from office to fill the vacancy until the end of 
tenure, with the exception of justices of the peace. 
  Article 25. New elections will be called only if the removal 
of more than one-third of the members of the Municipal Council 
has been confirmed. Alternate members may fill in until 
replacements for those removed from office are nominated. The 
same procedure will be followed if one-third of the directly 
elected members of the Regional Coordination Council are 
removed. Those who replace the ousted members will complete the 
latter's tenure. 
  Article 26. In the case of ousted elected judiciary 
officials, the National Election Board will proceed pursuant to 
the law that deals with this subject. 
  Article 27. Authorities appointed by the central or regional 
governments under regional, departmental, provincial, or 
district jurisdiction are removable. Political-Military chiefs 
in state-of-emergency areas are exempted. 
  Article 28. Dismissal will take place only when the National 
Election Board can attest that more than 50 percent of citizens 
from a constituency or judicial district request so. 
  Article 29. An elected official who has been removed from 
office is qualified to run for the same elected post in the next 
elections. 
  Article 30. The official who has been dismissed from office 
may not resume the same post for five years. 
  Chapter IV 
  On the Demand of Rendering of Accounts 
  Article 31. Through the rendering of accounts, citizens have 
the right to interpellate authorities about the execution of the 
budget and the use of budget funds. Authorities are obliged to 
answer. Those who occupy positions subject to removal and 
dismissal are subject to this demand of rendering of accounts. 
  The funds to which Article 170 of the Constitution refer to 
are subject to rendering of accounts according to the pertaining 
law. 
  Article 32. The interpellation form must contain questions 
exclusively related with the subjects included in the former 
article. Each question must be made in a clear, precise manner 
on the pertaining subject. 
  Article 33. The National Election Board must verify that the 
interpellation form contains appropriate, inoffensive wording. 
  Article 34. The rendering of accounts must be called for by 
at least 20 percent, with a maximum 50,000 signatures, of the 
voting population in the respective voting district. 
  Article 35. Once the rendering of accounts is demanded, the 
National Election Board must inform the authorities of its 
reception so that it may clearly and directly answer the 
interpellation form within 60 calendar days. 
  Article 36. The authorities requested to render accounts 
must 
publish the interpellation form together with the answers to it. 
  Chapter V 
  On the Referendum and Popular Consultations 
  Article 37. A referendum is the citizens' right to express 
their opinion, according to the Constitution, on the regulations 
of the subjects on which they are consulted. 
  Article 38. A referendum may be requested by an amount of 
citizens not less than 10 percent of the national voting 
population. 
  Article 39. A referendum is applicable in the following 
cases: 
  a. The total or partial amendment of the Constitution, 
according to Article 206 of the Constitution. 
  b. To approve laws, general regional regulations, and 
municipal provisions. 
  c. To disapprove laws, legislative and urgent decrees, as 
well as norms to which the former clause refer. 
  d. To the subjects described in Article 190 of the 
Constitution, according to a special law. 
  Article 40. The matters and regulations mentioned in the 
second paragraph of Article 32 of the Constitution may not be 
subject to a referendum. 
  Article 41. If Congress rejects or substantially modifies 
the 
proposed legislation, the terms of this law may be applied to 
request initiation of a referendum process, adding the necessary 
number of signatures to complete the legally required number of 
votes. 
  Article 42. The result of the referendum will determine the 
enforcement of the approved regulations, or the repeal of the 
rejected regulations, provided the decision is backed by 50 
percent plus one, without counting blank or null votes. The 
result will be valid only if backed by no fewer than 30 percent 
of the total number of voters, and will come into force on the 
day after publication of the official results by the National 
Election Board. 
  Article 43. Regulations approved through a referendum may 
not 
be modified within two years after their enforcement, except by 
a new referendum or by a Congressional decision upholding the 
modification in two congressional periods of sessions, with the 
approving vote of two thirds of the legal number of congressmen. 
If the result of the referendum is negative, the initiative may 
not be again proposed for two years after the referendum. 
  Article 44. The electoral authority will call for the 
referendum within four months of the approval of respective 
initiative. 
  Chapter VI 
  Final Provisions 
  Article 45. The call for electoral processes for the 
exercise 
of the political rights established by this law may be postponed 
by the electoral authority in case of proximity of general, 
regional, or municipal elections. In such case, the process may 
be implemented simultaneously or within the next four months. 
  Article 46. The electoral authority may accumulate approved 
initiatives and jointly submit them for consultation or to 
accompany other electoral processes. 
  Article 47. The sponsors of initiatives that result in the 
issuance of regulations, laws, or Constitutional amendments; or 
requests for canceling officials' designations or for dismissing 
officials; and the requests for referendum to repeal regulations 
or to approve a legislation proposal that was rejected or 
substantially modified by Congress, may request the 
reimbursement of expenses incurred before the electoral 
authority and for advertising, in keeping with the budgetary 
availabilities of the National Election Board, and in the form 
established by the National Election Board. 
  It is so ordered. 
  Lima, on the 18th day of April of the year 1994.

  [Text] The new orientation of U.S. policies toward Latin 
America will trigger a reaction from regional countries and 
prompt them to search for imaginative, global, and definitive 
solutions to border problems that have remained unsolved for too 
long. This new trend will also create a real possibility for 
Bolivia to obtain a sea outlet through dialogue. 
  This is the opinion of International Relations Secretary 
General Jaime Aparicio, in referring to the proposal made by 
Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American 
affairs, on the need to solve border problems in the region. 
During a speech at the U.S. Congress on 5 May, Watson announced 
that one of his goals will be "to seek opportunities for 
dialogue to allow the United States to contribute to the 
solution of border problems in Latin America." 
  According to Jorge Crespo, former ambassador to the United 
States, the situation could be used by the Foreign Ministry to 
draw up a new strategy, for presentation at the next OAS 
meeting, for recovering Bolivia's sea outlet.

  [Text] The situation is back to normal in the government 
alliance. We are talking about the UCS [Solidarity Civic 
Union]. We have a report from Mario Espinoza: 
  [Begin recording] [Espinoza] Nothing happened, and UCS 
leader 
Max Fernandez, who was meeting with Government Minister German 
Quiroga and Presidential Minister Carlos Sanchez, told reporters 
that everything is fine, that the situation is back to normal. 
  [Fernandez] We have come to a happy ending [words 
indistinct] 
in the search for understanding between the MNR [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement] and the UCS. I believe an important 
step has been taken to continue to work together. 
  [Espinoza] Max Fernandez labeled the recent disagreements 
between the UCS and the MNR as a little impasse. He added that 
from now on there will be more coordination between the two 
parties. 
  [Fernandez] Congressional activities will also be 
normalized. 
With this explanation I would therefore like to convey to the 
country that everything is back to normal, that there is no 
longer any speculation, that on the contrary I am convinced that 
from now on we will do better work. 
  [Espinoza] The members of the UCS and the MNR, and all the 
members of the executive branch, are all very happy. But the 
one who was left in a very awkward position was the UCS deputy 
who had accused the MNR of trying to buy UCS deputies. [end

  [Text] On 11 May in Poptun, Peten, Defense Minister 
Division General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales said the Guatemalan 
Army anticipates major problems after the government and the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] sign peace 
agreements, probably next December. 
  "Peace might be around the corner, but we are living one of 
the most decisive and pivotal moments in Guatemalan history; 
consequently, political and military efforts are necessary in 
order to consolidate a long-desired peace in this nation," 
Enriquez Morales stated during the commencement of the 42d class 
of Kaibiles [Guatemalan counterinsurgency troops] in Poptun, 
Peten. Over 40 Guatemalan, Mexican, and Salvadoran soldiers 
received the Kaibil rank under the motto: "If I go forward, 
follow me. If I stop, hurry me up. If I go back, kill me." 
  Enriquez Morales believes the end of the internal armed 
confrontation will cause serious problems. These problems, he 
asserted, will go beyond mere political bounds because a high 
level of misinformation exists and will prevail. He stressed 
that, as a result, the URNG will want to come out the front door 
[salir en caballo blanco], which will hinder national unity. 
  Regarding the coming meeting between the government and the 
URNG in Oslo, Norway, scheduled for late May, Enriquez Morales 
said: "Let us hope there is political will on the part of the 
URNG to be able to sign, once and for all, a peace agreement by 
the end of 1994." 
  Enriquez Morales, accompanied by the other members of the 
Army's high command, decorated over 40 Guatemalan, Mexican, and 
Salvadoran soldiers during the ceremony. These soldiers spent 
two months in Peten's jungle and earned the Kaibil rank. The 
commencement was held at the Kaibil Special Operations Center, 
located in the Zaculeu Plaza, known as Poptun's Hell [Infierno 
de Poptun]. Enriquez Morales added that the Army will reject a 
reduction of its troops so long as they are prepared to join the 
UN-led international peace security forces or blue helmets.

<F P=106> [From the "Channel 7 News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
[URNG] admitted it has imposed a war tax on large farm owners 
but denied that it made death threats against farmers. Last week 
the General Association of Farmers of Guatemala accused the 
guerrillas of making death threats against 213 farm owners and 
demanding a war tax in exchange for not destroying cattle 
ranches and coffee, banana, and sugar cane crops. 
  The guerrillas issued a document in Mexico City arguing that 
in a country at war, these political-military operations are 
directed against the economic interests of one sector 
responsible for the continuation of the armed conflict. This 
measure only affects the properties and belongings of those 
farmers who refuse to pay the war tax and who have derived large 
profits from the sweat of a labor force resembling the colonial 
encomiendas, the URNG said. 
  The URNG leadership warned that such operations will 
continue 
so long as the armed conflict continues and so long as it is not 
resolved by negotiations or political agreements between 
negotiating parties. 
  Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales made these 
comments to "Channel 7 News:" 
  [Begin Enriquez recording] We are doing all we can to track 
down the individuals who are extorting money from farmers and 
those who favor [words indistinct] job opportunity in Guatemala. 
Guatemala's productive sector has been hit hard by the URNG. 
They are now demanding war taxes of up to 2 million quetzales. 
In general, they ask for 250,000, 150,000, or 100,000 quetzales 
in war taxes. Those who do not pay face the destruction of 
their farms. Workers from many farms -- we have confirmed 
this in areas we have patrolled -- [words indistinct] farmers 
are trying to collect money to pay and then disregard the 
workers. [Words indistinct] pay the extortion or that ill-named 
war tax and disregard their workers. I even spoke to producers 
in [words indistinct] and Escuintla. I asked if they wanted to 
form voluntary committees [words indistinct] I would do it. 
Why? Because the rebels are giving me a reason to do this, and 
the human rights agreement that was signed deals with this.

  [Text] The UN preliminary commission left the country after 
spending a week in Guatemala where they established the 
importance of the Human Rights Verification Commission. 
According to remarks by mission members, they left the country 
in high spirits because the current situation in Guatemala is 
quite encouraging. Leonardo Franco, head of the UN delegation, 
commented on their work in Guatemala: 
  [Franco] "Through meetings held over the past two weeks [as 
heard], we have reached a very significant consensus within 
Guatemalan society concerning human rights. 
  ``First, there is consensus on the importance of the General 
Human Rights Agreement signed on 29 March which, in everyone's 
opinion, marks a very encouraging phase in the Guatemalan peace 
process. 
  ``Second, there is also consensus on the international 
verification mission, which was requested on the one hand by the 
government and on the other by the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] command in the general agreement and which 
the broadest sectors of society view as a very positive factor 
for the observance of human rights in the country. 
  ``Finally, on the issue of consensus, the mission's 
government and nongovernment interlocutors also unanimously 
agreed that the verification mission should arrive in the 
country as soon as possible. We will recommend this to the UN 
secretary general. 
  ``"Third, this consensus will undoubtedly prompt an adequate 
response from the international community concerning the 
Guatemalan people's efforts to achieve human rights and peace.'' 
  Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez commented on the 
remarks 
made by the UN preliminary mission members regarding the 
immediate installation of the Human Rights Verification 
Commission in Guatemala. 
  [Enriquez] "They have, of course, a general impression of 
the 
country, which will serve as the foundation for their 
recommendations to the UN secretary general concerning 
verification, which I hope will take place as soon as possible. 
I believe the Guatemalan community, in general, agrees that the 
Verification Commission should come to Guatemala as soon as 
possible." 
  The defense minister also commented on the invitation 
extended to him by the Permanent Refugee Commissions [CPR] and 
said he is willing to talk with the URNG commanders. 
  [Enriquez] "They have invited me to visit them and I will 
certainly go. I would like to tell you that certain reports 
have been published which, perhaps, are the result of a 
misinterpretation by the person who wrote them because I, as 
defense minister, will not go looking for the subversives and 
the terrorist criminals in Ixcan. No. If they were to invite 
me to a meeting supervised by the United Nations, I would go 
because I have nothing to fear. I have spoken with the URNG 
leadership and I believe that for the sake of peace we should 
reach an agreement." 
  Enriquez also reiterated a desire for a cease-fire in the 
area of the Ixcan and Xalbal Rivers, about which the Guatemalan 
Episcopal Conference has issued a statement. 
  [Enriquez] "The Defense Ministry accepts that statement 100 
percent because, I believe, the person who has done the most to 
promote it has been the president, of course, but through me. I 
advocate a definitive cease-fire between the Xalbal and Ixcan 
Rivers and also that the refugees, repatriates, and CPR's allow 
themselves to receive full aid without influence and looking 
only to the future, a better future for our new generations and 
so they themselves can live in peace and tranquility in that 
area."

  [Text] Quito, 13 May (NOTIMEX) -- A meeting called by the 
government to remove the director of the Ecuadoran Social 
Security Institute [IESS] turned violent today, sparking street 
disturbances that resulted in 18 people being injured and a 
minister being detained by workers. 
  Social Welfare Minister Alberto Cardenas was detained at the 
IESS headquarters by angry union leaders and workers who 
demanded his resignation. Cardenas presided over the meeting of 
IESS officials which culminated at noon with the removal of IESS 
Director General Italo Colamarco, accused of corruption and 
incompetence. 
  While the two-hour meeting was being held, hundreds of IESS 
employees clashed in the streets of Quito with the police who, 
according to reporters, resorted to a "brutal repression." The 
clashes occurred in streets near the Zarzuela building in 
northern Quito, headquarters of the IESS General Directorate and 
Higher Council, which sustained heavy damage. 
  Despite the presence of a large number of police, a group of 
IESS labor leaders and employees entered the building and 
reached the meeting room. They interrupted the meeting in which 
Jose Maria Aguirre, a close friend of the Ecuadoran president, 
was being sworn in as the new IESS director and seized the 
social welfare minister. Amid the confusion and the arguments 
with the government representatives in the Higher Council, the 
leaders demanded that Minister Cardenas submit his resignation. 
The minister replied he was willing to resign and "go home" if 
the IESS union leadership did the same and resigned immediately. 
  Meanwhile, the street disturbances continued. The police 
used 
tear gas to control the demonstrators "with excessive force." 
The demonstrators responded by throwing sticks and rocks. 
According to reporters and union leaders, the incidents left at 
least 18 injured, some from firearms, and many persons under 
arrest. The Red Cross reported that the injured included two 
local reporters and a cameraman who were hit by rocks and blunt 
objects. 
  The crisis in the IESS leadership intensified this week when 
Minister Cardenas and Colamarco accused each other of 
incompetence and corruption. The new scandal in the IESS led to 
Colamarco's removal. He was the fifth director in 21 months in 
the administration of conservative President Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
Cardenas, who took office as minister in January, said the 
removed official was an obstacle to the modernization and 
reorganization of the IESS. 
  Union leaders say that Cardenas and the government are 
undertaking a campaign to discredit the IESS workers to bring 
about its bankruptcy and justify its privatization.

  [Excerpt] Union leaders reported that at least five IESS 
employees were injured in a clash with police when they were 
protesting government plans to privatize the IESS. A union 
leader said the injuries were inflicted by members of the 
security forces during an act of brutal repression in which tear 
gas and police sticks were used. I want to express my strong 
condemnation of this criminal repression, the leader said. Five 
of our fellow workers were injured solely for the crime of 
defending social security, he added. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Vilma Estrada from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro has said that her 
government has shown clear signals of its determination to 
settle the property issue, adding that it does not need a 90-day 
deadline to resolve the problem of properties confiscated from 
U.S. citizens, as stipulated by an amendment approved by the 
U.S. Congress. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] [Words indistinct] 90 days. I 
have 
given clear signals of my resolve to settle this issue since I 
assumed the presidency. We have returned what does not belong to 
us and gradually resolved other problems. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Leal explained that the Gonzalez-Helms 
Amendment deals with returning properties confiscated from U.S. 
citizens or compensating them as well as with creating a 
procedure to resolve this problem in keeping with international 
law. This is precisely, he continued, what the Nicaraguan 
Government has been doing. 
  [Begin recording] [Leal] We began returning properties in 
the 
hands of the state in October of last year. We began with 40 
companies. This is an ongoing process, because as soon as we 
return some properties, more U.S. citizens appear demanding 
other properties. 
  [Chamorro, interrupting] I may add that it is not only U.S. 
citizens but citizens of Spain, Mexico, and other parts of the 
world who are demanding the return of their properties. This is 
a terrible situation. We, the Army, and the police must all work 
together to solve the problem. Everyone who profited from the 
pinata-like giveaway must return the properties. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What do you think of the 
insinuations 
made by the director of Channel 8, who questioned your authority 
as president during an interview with Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo? 
  [Chamorro] [Words indistinct] is wrong because I was elected 
by the people. I am in control, not Antonio. Antonio, like my 
foreign minister and everyone who works here, is working for all 
of you, for the people of Nicaragua. [end recording] 
  President Chamorro presented 21 motorcycles to 21 
humanitarian institutions in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Moises Castillo Zeas] </F>
  [Text] Matagalpa -- Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], has rejected the 
Gonzalez-Helms amendment recently approved by the U.S. Congress 
on the return of property to U.S. citizens in Nicaragua within 
90 days. 
<H5>  Santa Emilia Assembly </H5>
  Ortega addressed an assembly of peasant leaders meeting at 
the Santa Emilia School, 18 km north of Matagalpa, to discuss a 
peasant proposal that will be presented at the FSLN special 
congress to be held in Managua. 
  The former president said that the only way to stop this 
threat is "for all Nicaraguans to join in a common front and 
tell the United States that this is not feasible because it 
would create greater instability in the country." 
<H5>  Search for a Solution </H5>
  However, Ortega added, we must find a solution to this issue 
without affecting the country's interests because paying the 
compensation they are requesting ($600 million) is totally 
unacceptable. 
  The FSLN leader added that during meetings of the Superior 
Council of Private Enterprise [COSEP] it has been said that the 
COSEP would not agree to a policy of compensation because it 
would worsen the country's economic problems. 
  Daniel warned that this threat will force the executive to 
seek solutions. Ortega warned that "that the decision could 
result in serious problems in the search for the country's 
stability." 
<H5>  Somoza Family Benefited </H5>
  The former president stressed that these measures will 
benefit the family of the late dictator Anastasio Somoza because 
they are gringos "since they have requested U.S. citizenship and 
will now come and claim their properties." 
  The Sandinist leader said that for the government to put an 
end to this property issue it must recognize Laws 85, 86, and 
88. He said that these are valid and legitimate laws. Ortega 
recalled that the government had specialists in legal matters 
brought in to review the aforementioned laws, who found these to 
be flawless and thus gave their approval. Ortega added that had 
the government found a flaw in these laws it would have 
abolished them immediately. 
<H5>  The Problem in the Countryside </H5>
  Meanwhile, hundreds of peasant leaders in the northern 
sector 
of the country gathered at the Santa Emilia School to reach an 
agreement on the problems experienced by the countryside that 
will be presented at the FSLN special congress next week. At 
this moment, hundreds of peasant leaders are studying various 
proposals such as the legalization of property, the distribution 
of agrarian deeds, financial assistance, technical assistance, 
land, participation by women, and other issues that will be 
discussed at a meeting scheduled for 0900 on 16 May at the Santa 
Emilia School. 
  Jose Gonzalez, FSLN political secretary in Matagalpa, said 
that the FSLN National Directorate will be present at this 
peasant meeting. The meeting will also be attended by peasant 
leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the UNAG [National Union 
of Farmers and Cattlemen], the ATC [Farm Workers Association], 
and others who can offer ideas aimed at solving the problems 
encountered by the countryside.

  [Text] Managua, 15 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Sandinist People's 
Army (EPS) today reported that yesterday they seized a Costa 
Rican boat 16 km north of the Costa Rican border for illegally 
navigating inside Nicaraguan waters. 
  EPS spokesman Ricardo Wheelock said that they arrested seven 
passengers--three Costa Ricans and four U.S. citizens--and that 
the boat was towed to Bluefields on Nicaragua's atlantic coast. 
  "They probably were sport fishing. It is also a drug 
trafficking area, and that it is why there are special EPS 
patrols in that area," Wheelock told the press. 
  Contrary to the EPS report, Costa Rican Security Minister 
Juan Diego Castro said that the Nicaraguan patrol boats entered 
Costa Rican territorial waters to apprehend two boats, not one, 
as Wheelock had said. 
  Castro said he contacted the Nicaraguan Government Ministry 
to work on the release of the people arrested, but the ministry 
spokespersons were not available.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 13 May (EFE) -- Opposition leader 
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez said today that high-ranking military 
officers have discussed a plan, which was disavowed by President 
Joaquin Balaguer, to prevent the transfer of power to the 
opposition if it wins the Dominican elections, 
  According to Pena Gomez, two "friendly" generals informed 
him 
of a meeting held last Monday at the Defense Secretariat 
Operations Center attended by Lt. Gen. Constantino Matos 
Villanueva, Armed Forces secretary, and other generals who were 
not identified. 
  Pena Gomez said a plan was discussed at the meeting to allow 
the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) of President 
Balaguer to retain power in case it loses the 16 May elections, 
but a group of officers at the meeting opposed the measure. 
  The opposition leader did not specify which position was 
taken by the secretary of the Armed Forces. 
  Pena Gomez said the subject of the meeting was made known to 
President Joaquin Balaguer, who disavowed the same and asked the 
Armed Forces to keep its distance from the electoral and 
democratic process. 
  The leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
praised 
the president's position and the professionalism of the Armed 
Forces and asked Balaguer to discipline the military officers 
who proposed the plan discussed at the meeting, which was 
"recorded" by the two officers who reported the same. 
  Pena Gomez' accusations come 24 hours after the Armed Forces 
issued a communique, signed by Lt. Gen. Matos Villanueva and 
other generals, expressing their willingness to guarantee 
constitutional order and peace during the election. The Armed 
Forces warned that any attempt to alter the results would be 
strongly dealt with. 
  In a televised appearance, Pena Gomez also asked that the 
Haitian border be closed for three days, next Sunday, Monday, 
and Tuesday -- Monday is election day -- to prevent "adventurers 
on both sides" from interfering in the elections. 
  Pena Gomez' request stems from a minority party report that 
sectors close to the government and the PRSC plan to cause 
incidents at the border during the election to alarm the 
population and influence the elections results.

  [Text] Two days after he took office and was installed as 
provisional president of the Republic by the Army and the 
unofficial Office of the Senate, Justice Emile Jonassaint has 
not yet published the names of his government. According to 
Dominique Levanti of AFP, who quoted well-informed sources, Mr. 
Jonassaint's steps toward formation of a government are 
allegedly hindered by strong U.S. pressure on those who could be 
appointed ministers in order to dissuade them, a report denied 
by the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince through its spokesman, 
Stanley Schrager. 
  [Schrager] "No, not at all. The U.S. Government is putting 
no 
pressure on this new -- this so-called government. But I would 
say instead that the reason the so-called president cannot find 
ministers who would like to participate in his government is 
that no self-respecting Haitians would be part of such a 
government. That is the problem. It is not pressure from 
elsewhere that is preventing this so-called government from 
functioning." 
  On the part of the supporters of the implementation of 
Article 149 of the Constitution, this delay in the formation of 
the government is explained by the fact that attorney Jonassaint 
finds himself in an awkward position because he has to choose 
from an overabundance of names. This is, for instance, the 
opinion of Hubert De Ronceray, who is a possible prime minister. 
  [De Ronceray] "Once again, I cannot answer with precise 
explanations, but I suppose that President Jonassaint must be 
facing a pretty wide range of proposals. He must -- perhaps with 
clear-mindedness -- be checking all those proposals so as to end 
up in a correct choice which meets all the criteria that are 
essential on this occasion." 
  It should be noted that several names are circulating for 
the 
post of prime minister. Rumor has it that the latter is 
allegedly a woman, a lawyer who is well-known in Port-au-Prince 
for her statements in favor of the coup d'etat. But there is a 
major problem for this government: the matter of due 
ratification by the two chambers of the parliament. It is 
allegedly almost impossible to reach a quorum, given that the 
socialists and the National Front for Change and Democracy 
members have dissociated themselves from the partisans of 
Article 149 and did not participate in the session held on the 
installation of Justice Jonassaint -- unless, of course, the 
procedures established by the Constitution are ignored, as was 
the case on 11 May.

<F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 May (EFE) -- De facto President 
Emile Jonassaint, 84, and his allies have been isolated by the 
country's major political sectors despite the fact that 
Jonassaint is supported by the coupist military. 
  Former de facto Prime Minister Marc Bazin has joined the 
voices condemning Jonassaint's designation as provisional 
president. 
  A minority of legislators, with the backing of the top 
military commands and General Raoul Cedras, leader of the 
military coup that toppled Constitutional President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991, named Jonassaint to 
replace him. "There is no serious basis for what happened on 
11 May; not at a political consensus level, a constitutional 
level, or in foreign relations," stated Bazin, leader of the 
Movement for the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti (MIDH). 
According to Bazin, the "Jonassaint solution" complicates and 
delays a solution to the crisis in Haiti because it closes the 
door to dialogue. In remarks made on the radio, Bazin said his 
party disagreed with the designation and considered it "a 
dead-end street." He went on to ask for "a realistic 
compromise to rescue Haiti's democracy and independence." 
  "I hope," he said, "that before 21 May, the date the total 
embargo against this country goes into force, we can prevent the 
escalation toward absurdity and desolation." 
  Ferge Gilles of the Haitian Nationalist Progressive 
Revolutionary Party (Pampra), said socialists will not 
participate in the future government of Jonassaint and called 
for the resumption of dialogue and negotiation. 
  With the rejection of these two political groups, Pampra and 
MIDH, which have representatives in the Assembly, as well as of 
the constitutionalists, Jonassaint and his allies have been 
practically isolated, which could have an impact on the 
formation of his cabinet. 
  Louis E. Roy, considered the father of the Haitian 
Constitution and a colleague of Jonassaint in the Assembly that 
drafted the Constitution, said it saddened him that a former 
colleague went along with a military ploy. 
  Roy made those remarks from exile in Canada and said he 
understands that the "judge was pressured by those who forced 
Aristide to abandon power." 
  Only Humbert de Ronceray, leader of the Mobilization for 
National Development (MDN) and proponent of the appointment of a 
new president to replace Aristide, has endorsed Jonassaint's 
appointment. 
  Outgoing Prime Minister Robert Malval; Aristide spokesman 
Jean Claude Martineau; Victor Benoit, leader of the National 
Congress of Democratic Forces (Conacom); and the National Front 
for Change and Democracy (FNCD) that took Aristide to power have 
condemned Jonassaint's "illegal" and "illegitimate" designation. 
The Haitian Workers Federation [Central de los Trabajadores 
Haitianos] said Bernard Sansaricq, Jonassaint, and those who 
have supported the ploy will be chiefly responsible for any 
possible foreign intervention. Banes Cherestal, secretary 
general of the National Federation of Popular Organizations, 
described the appointment as a new coup d'etat that will 
exacerbate the extreme poverty of the Haitian people. 
  Jonassaint has begun consultations to name the new prime 
minister, a task that will be difficult in view of the threats 
by the U.S. Government to cancel the entry visas of those who 
join his government.

  [Text] Marc Louis Bazin, leader of the Movement for the 
Establishment of Democracy in Haiti, MIDH, rejects the 
initiative from the senators of the [Senate] Office led by 
Sansaricq. It is a dead-end operation, the MIDH president 
asserted in our microphone: 
  [Begin Bazin recording] The 11 May operation has no serious 
basis, neither on the constitutional level nor on the level of 
relations with other nations. Furthermore, the fact that it 
closes the door to dialogue inevitably complicates and delays 
the solution to the crisis. 
  In regards to the embargo -- in other respects as 
reprehensible -- far from lightening the consequences, it is 
going to exacerbate getting supplies, the impossibility of 
export, increasing prices, the exchange rate of the gourde, 
unemployment, and, in a more general way, the living conditions 
of the huge majority of our compatriots whose survival in the 
current situation depends every day on a miracle and challenges 
all rationality. The 11 May operation is therefore a dead-end 
situation. MIDH rejects it. 
  Today there is no longer time to cloud the issues by adding 
fuel to the flames. In these worrisome hours when we are openly 
threatened by foreign military intervention, the priority of 
priorities for every Haitian should be to do everything possible 
to spare the country new crises and tough humiliation. 
  Therefore, each of us should agree to sacrifice part of our 
pride and our ambition and consent, in good faith, to a 
realistic compromise which reinforces the chance of democracy 
and safeguards our independence. The nation expects the effort 
of such a compromise. The nation is not resigned to the 
inevitable. It is, on the contrary, convinced that with a 
minimum of courage and a sense of responsibility nothing is 
impossible and that from now until 21 May, we would be spared an 
escalation toward absurdity and distress. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The president of the Senate, Senator Firmin 
Jean-Louis, this week issued a statement condemning the 
installation of Justice Emile Jonassaint as Haitian president. 
Here is this statement: 
  On 11 May, a tragic new scene was played at the Haitian 
parliament with the alleged appointment of Justice Emile 
Jonassaint as provisional president of Haiti. We are frankly 
surprised that Attorney Jonassaint, who was a senator of the 
Republic, judge of the highest judicial authority of the 
country, and president of the 1987 Constituent Assembly, agreed 
to be a party to such a joke by shouldering the responsibility 
for such a crude violation of the same Constitution [of 1987], 
writes Firmin Jean-Louis. 
  As president of the National Assembly, we make a point of 
drawing the attention of the entire nation and the international 
community in general to the fact that this new abuse of 
authority is assumed by only five out of 17 senators of the 
normalized Senate and by eight senators elected in the contested 
18 January 1993 elections who are awaiting the verdict of the 
arbitration committee provided for in the New York pact. 
  As of that moment, as an institution which has rules 
governing its functioning and a defined procedure, the Haitian 
parliament is not bound by this new political adventure which 
has no grandeur and no future. It is not a parliamentary act. 
Consequently, it is a usurpation of power and must be considered 
as such, Jean-Louis says. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The socialists will not be part of the future 
government. PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary 
Party Of Haiti] leader Serge Gilles so stated this morning at 
our microphone. He was the guest in the morning broadcast: 
  [Begin recording] [Gilles] The position of my party is 
clear. 
It is the same position as that of the socialist bloc. We have 
expressed it already. It is clear. We are against Article 149 
and therefore we do not agree. This government does not have our 
support. 
  [Reporter Renois] Does that mean, Serge Gilles, that PANPRA 
will not agree to participate in the formation of the future 
government that Mr. Jonassaint will establish? 
  [Gilles] Not at all. Not at all. We have said so. For the 
past two weeks, it has been clear. We are against Article 149; 
since the coup d'etat, we have been against Article 149. We have 
always said that a negotiated return is necessary. It is 
necessary to go back to the negotiation table, to dialogue. 
  [Renois] In your opinion, is negotiation still possible 
today? 
  [Gilles] Negotiation is always possible; I am convinced of 
that. Dialogue is always possible. But good faith is necessary 
on both sides, by the two protagonists. This is what we say. And 
for a dialogue to be fruitful, it is necessary to listen to each 
other. It cannot be a dialogue of the deaf. 
  [Renois] Are not the doors closed for this dialogue that 
your 
party hopes for? 
  [Gilles] No! I hope that the doors remain open. We want to 
force them. It is necessary that the doors remain open. It is 
necessary that we return to negotiations. It is necessary to 
return to dialogue. For us, it is an obligatory passage. This 
crisis, as we have said, is so deep that it will not be solved 
with sanctions, not with an embargo, not with Articles 149, 148, 
or 111. This crisis cannot be solved with a constitutional 
cover. A political compromise is necessary. It is necessary to 
reach a compromise. It is necessary that the protagonists resign 
themselves to finding this compromise on specific points 
regarding Haitian society, the Haitian people, the Haitian 
nation. [end recording]

  [Text] Decree of the Senate of the Republic: 
  In view of the 1987 Constitution in its provisions governing 
the matter; 
  In view of the resolution of the Senate of the Republic 
dated 
10 April 1994, taking note of the vacuum in the executive with 
the legal consequences; 
  Considering that despite extreme urgency and imminent peril, 
the Chamber of Deputies has still not ruled on the necessity and 
the method to fill this vacuum; 
  Considering that the National Assembly was due to meet on 
Monday, 9 May 1994, in order to close the seventh session of the 
45th Legislature and that this Assembly was duly convened but 
could not be held; 
  Considering, in fact, the working difficulties inherent in 
the antipatriotic behavior of the legislators who for several 
months have blocked the administration of the national life for 
the purpose of satisfying certain particular interests; 
  Considering that the nation's future and present cannot be 
left to the caprice of irresponsible citizens; 
  Considering the gravity and the imminence of the danger of a 
total split threatening the Haitian nation through a vast plot 
aimed at the destabilization of institutions; 
  Considering the illegal and abusive attitude of the 
international community, taking advantage of the right of force 
as much through threats of military intervention as through the 
passage of Resolution 917 of the U.N. Security Council, which 
constitutes a death sentence without appeal against the first 
black republic of the New World [applause]; 
  Considering the urgent necessity to endow the country with a 
head of state and to reestablish the authority of the state to 
face this situation, the Senate of the Republic orders: 
  Article 1: The resolution of the Senate of the Republic 
dated 
10 April 1994 will be enforced, appending the seal of the Senate 
of the Republic, in view of the impossibility of the 
parliament's meeting in National Assembly. 
  Article 2: The Senate calls on all patriotic deputies and 
the 
other responsible sectors of the nation to support it in the 
enforcement of a resolution on the immediate nomination of the 
president of the Court of Cassation [Supreme Court] to the 
provisional Presidency of the Republic. [applause] 
  Article 3: The present parliamentary act will be announced, 
published, and executed through the diligence of the Office of 
the Senate of the Republic. 
  Executed in the Legislative Palace in Port-au-Prince on this 
10 May 1994, year of independence 191. 
  For the Senate of the Republic: Bernard Sansaricq, Senate 
president; Ebrane Cadet, first secretary; Margareth Martin, 
second secretary. 
  For the deputies, supporting the Senate in its patriotic 
act: 
Josue Lafrance, Emmanuel Reyme, Gabriel Antoinier Clerval, 
Pierre Francois Vital. [applause]

declaring a presidential vacuum and providing for the

  [Text] Mr. President, Mr. President of the Senate, members 
of the Office: We announce the presence of Attorney Emile 
Jonassaint, president of the Court of Cassation, who in a few 
seconds will take the oath as provisional president of the 
Republic of Haiti. [applause] [words indistinct] to read the 10 
April 1994 resolution of the Senate of Republic: 
  Senate of the Republic of Haiti. Resolution of the Senate of 
the Republic. In view of Articles 1, 8, 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, (?136), 
(?137), (?138), 139, 148, 149, 153, 154, 155, and 170 of the 
Constitution; 
  In view of the resignation of President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide and his departure on 30 September 1991; 
  In view of the decision of the Court of Cassation of the 
Republic on 27 March 1992 declaring the Washington Agreement 
inoperative due to the defect of inequality between the parties; 
  In view of the 15 June 1993 decree of the National Assembly 
acknowledging citizen Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of the 
Republic; 
  Considering, however, that the attributions of the National 
Assembly are definitively defined by Article 98-3 of the 
Constitution [words indistinct] cannot be extended to other 
subjects; 
  Considering, nevertheless, that the 15 June 1993 decree 
received no consideration from the person mainly concerned and 
that it was followed by the signing, under the aegis of the 
United Nations, of two documents called the Governors Island 
agreement and the New York Pact; 
  Considering that those agreements shielded from the sanction 
of the parliament have not been executed and are from here on 
declared null and void; 
  Considering that the government called [Government] of 
Concord [words indistinct] has been resigned for four months and 
has not been replaced; 
  Considering that individual or group attempts to resolve the 
crisis -- that have been made since then -- such as the 27 
February 1994 Parliamentary Plan and a synchronous plan of the 
U.S. Statement Department have been categorically rejected by 
Mr. Aristide in his intransigence and stubbornness; 
  Considering that the country is experiencing one of the most 
terrible crises of its history, a crisis which endangers not 
only the institutional life of the state but also that of the 
Haitian people who are subjected to the stringencies of all 
deprivations; 
  Considering that in the meantime the Haitian people are 
experiencing a painful, deadly, and unprecedented situation for 
both their sons and their ecology [words indistinct] national 
boat drifting, without chief, without executive, shaky 
institutions, a state attacked at its very foundations; 
  Considering that under these conditions of exceptional 
gravity, the parliamentarians, joint guardians of the national 
sovereignty, are duty bound to [word indistinct] the boat by 
filling this institutional vacuum created and deliberately 
nourished; 
  Considering that in fact this refusal by President Aristide 
to endow the country with a head of government in violation of 
Article 147 is equivalent to a resignation; 
  Considering that there is good reason to take note of this 
presidential vacuum with all legal consequences; 
  Considering on the other hand that the international 
community has widely shown its inability to resolve the crisis 
while taking into account that Jean-Bertrand Aristide [words 
indistinct] to maintain and/or to reinforce the illegal and 
criminal economic sanctions have forced the responsible 
authorities in the country to find a constitutional solution to 
the problem; 
  Considering that to guarantee the enduring of the state and 
[word indistinct] this committee [words indistinct] there is 
good reason to reconstitute the executive power in order to 
achieve normalization of the national life; 
  Considering that citizen Robert Malval, prime minister, who 
resigned 15 December 1993, told the parliament in a letter dated 
7 February 1994 that he and the members of his government were 
no longer responsible before the parliament and therefore have 
no authority or competence to convene the National Assembly, it 
is now the responsibility of the legislative power to take the 
necessary measures alone; 
  Considering consequently that from this point on it is 
urgent 
to fill the presidential vacuum in compliance with the 
provisions of Article 149 of the Constitution to ensure the 
stability of the institutions and the continuation of the 
Haitian state, the Senate of the Republic has adopted the 
following resolution: 
  Article 1. The Senate takes note of President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide's obstinate refusal to carry out his constitutional 
obligations. Consequently, the Senate takes note of his 
resignation, declares a presidential vacuum, and revokes the 15 
June 1993 decree. 
  Article 2. In compliance with Article 149 of the 
Constitution, the president of the Court of Cassation is endowed 
with the powers of provisional president of the Republic. 
  Article 3. The provisional president chooses his prime 
minister in conformity with the Constitution for the formation 
of the government that will have to work toward holding the 
forthcoming elections in the country and presidential [words 
indistinct] in accordance with a timetable for the return to 
constitutional order. 
  Article 4. An ad hoc deadline is granted to the Provisional 
Government, given the exceptional circumstances for establishing 
the necessary structures. This deadline will not extend beyond 
the date of 7 February 1995, planned for the installation of the 
Communal Section Administration Councils, mayors, deputies, 
one-third of the Senate, and the next president-elect. 
  Executed at the Legislative Palace in Port-au-Prince on 10 
April 1994, the 191th year of independence. 
  [Signed] Bernard Sansaricq, senator of the Republic, 
president of the Senate; Pastor Ebrane Cadet, senator of the 
Republic, first secretary; Margareth Martin, senator of the 
Republic, second secretary. [applause]

  [Text] Trinidad and Tobago's Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj 
has described the appointment of a new president in Haiti by the 
regime there as an absurdity. He says it is an insult to the 
international community and makes a mockery of attempts to 
reestablish democracy in Haiti: 
  [Begin Maraj recording] We certainly will not recognize the 
new president. We think it a mockery, a mockery, a political 
mockery, and certainly the only president of Haiti that we 
recognize is President Aristide. [end recording] 
  The Haitian military and the promilitary parliament 
appointed 
the head of Haiti's Supreme Court as a provisional president. 
This is seen as an act of defiance of the U.N. Security Council 
ruling, the penalty for which could be military intervention. 
  [Begin Maraj recording] If indeed the United Nations takes a 
certain course of action, Trinidad and Tobago will do whatever 
it can and give very serious consideration to making any kind of 
contribution within its means to support any U.N. initiative in 
the solution of this Haitian crisis. [end recording] 
  Although the foreign minister says he would not like to see 
military intervention take place in Haiti, he says it is a last 
option and it may have to be considred, in the final analysis. 
  [Begin Maraj recording] Democracy has been on the march. We 
have just witnessed a dismantling of apartheid and the 
establishment of the first step toward a democratic way of life 
in South Africa. We cannot allow Haiti to continue like this. We 
must develop a strong and positive approach and do what is 
necessary at the multilateral level to deal with the situation.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Carlos Roberto Reina in Tegucigalpa on </F>
10 May] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens: On concluding the first 100 days of 
government, I think it is very important to address you on the 
state of the nation and to continue this frank and open dialogue 
on the situation of public administration regarding our most 
serious and pressing problems. 
  If democracy implies coordinating who should govern and how, 
nothing could be more appropriate than this communication 
between the people and their authorities, to obtain the 
consensus of all sectors on essential aspects of our national 
life. 
  To my fellow party members, I say that supporting the plan 
of 
my government's moral revolution does not only mean voting for 
it, but wholly supporting it so that it can advance. If we 
destroy the moral revolution, vast corruption would return. 
Such a state of affairs would mire us again in the situation 
that we want to overcome. It would be absurd to think that 
destroying the project of an authentic moral revolution would 
improve the Hondurans'economic situation. 
  Those opposed to my government consist of two principal 
groups: those who were overwhelmingly defeated at the polls, who 
were part of the old style of government, which was described by 
the U.S. Senate as one of the most corrupt in the world; and 
those impatient fellow citizens who rightfully want to see their 
expectations of participating in public administration fulfilled 
expeditiously. 
  Once again, I must note that Honduras' current problems stem 
principally from the ethical and administrative blunders of the 
former government. There is hardly any sector of the government 
during this period in which there has not been more than one 
illicit act or an act directly intended to favor a privileged 
group of public officials or a close political ally. 
  Administrative management, also, at the outset was deficient 
and incomplete, above all, in the field of economic 
reorganization. Not only were acquired commitments not 
fulfilled, but the actions of the new government were burdened 
by contracting new obligations which they never intended to put 
in practice. In this sense, the sacrifice of the people 
signified little or nothing. 
  Dishonesty among state workers was one of the most serious 
flaws of the former government. The massive communications 
media have consistently and in the most plausible manner 
denounced these facts throughout the presidential term. Thanks 
to the dedication of this group of Hondurans, actions such as 
the dilapidation of important resources of the country, which 
would have further depleted the wealth of our nation, were 
averted. 
  It is important that the people know how they were governed 
recently because this will make it easier for them to understand 
the multiple efforts that must be made to return to the path of 
development for all. On the one hand, the damage caused must be 
remedied. On the other hand, new actions must be undertaken in 
all aspects of national life. 
  In light of this situation, it is not fair to leave those 
who profited from the most shameless forms of corruption 
registered in recent Honduran history go unpunished. That is 
why we created the Commission To Prevent and Struggle Against 
Corruption, formed by different sectors of the population. 
Soon, this commission will report the first results of its 
investigations and the measures that must be taken to punish 
those responsible and return to the people what should have been 
theirs. 
  On this occasion, however, I can report to the Honduran 
people that at the initiative of ministers and managers of 
decentralized institutions, the following cases are being 
investigated: car imports from Italy; administration of the 
Property Registry Office; product imports by Banasupro [National 
Supply Agency for Basic Products]; sale of Honduran passports to 
Asian citizens; the Permanent Committee for Emergencies' 
handling and administration of resources to aid the homeless; 
customs administration; and the administration of the Teachers 
Retirement and Pension Institute, the Teachers' Social Security 
Institute, the National Autonomous Aqueduct and Sewage Service, 
among others. 
  It should be made clear to the public that the actions aimed 
at punishing the corrupt who have caused so much damage are only 
intended to make justice prevail and return to our society the 
unwithering values of honesty and loyalty to the Republic. This 
must not be viewed as an act of vengeance and much less as an 
act of political vengeance. 
  In the government program I presented to the people during 
the last electoral campaign, I said we would undertake economic 
policies that would not only favor growth but also distribute 
equality. We stressed the need to follow the path of equitable, 
sustainable, and verifiable economic growth with an option for 
the country's poor. 
  To carry out a long-term program that strengthens and 
transforms national production is a task we have undertaken 
since the beginning of our administration, for without a general 
development policy plan it is not possible to see clearly where 
are we leading the country in the coming years. But while we 
devise these medium- and long-term policies, it is urgently 
necessary to implement provisional actions leading to an 
indispensable waiting period, while the economy in general is 
reactivated. 
  The aforementioned statement becomes more critical because 
when we planned the Liberal Party government program, the data 
we had led us to believe that a three- to six-month waiting 
period was essential to implement the necessary corrective 
actions in the fiscal sector and then devote our attention to 
most urgent tasks favoring the needy and economic growth tasks. 
  This was and is the perception and the clear, definite, and 
fundamental objective of the government. As the first weeks 
passed, however, and we learned the reality of the data on the 
country's financial and economic situation, we have reached the 
cruel but realistic conclusion that the Honduran economy, in 
early 1994, is facing the need to make several corrective 
measures. 
  I say this based on the data on the finances of the public 
sector, the balance of payments deficit, the foreign debt 
payment, the handling of controlled prices, and the signing of 
mandatory contracts preventing the reduction of public 
investment. 
  This last factor, the exorbitant spending that has no 
priority in public investment and which lacks a cost analysis 
and benefits for Hondurans, and which does not consider its 
impact on the fiscal deficit for the years after 1993, worsens 
the situation we have depicted. The expansion of telephone 
lines, which represent an investment of over $200 million in 
less than 18 months; the contracts signed for the construction 
of the ring road in Tegucigalpa and compensation payments for 
the owners of properties that neighbor the road; and other 
projects are good examples. 
  The current situation is also pressing because the 
mishandling of the monetary policy increased the interest rates 
prevailing in the banking sector, thus raising costs for the 
productive sectors. 
  As for prices, in addition to the agreements businessmen 
accepted, the decree to freeze prices that enabled the former 
administration to keep inflation down artificially stands out. 
A low inflation level was also maintained through the use of 
international reserves that kept the exchange rate at a lower 
level than that of the market. This manipulative conduct by the 
former government resulted in transferring an inflation rate 
that surpassed a 2 percent monthly average in the past three 
months to the economy and the population. 
  The following figures speak for themselves: The unadjusted 
public sector deficit for 1994 exceeds 2.7 million lempiras, 
which represents over 11 percent of the GDP. By the end of 
January 1994, there were $143 million in late debt payments, 
including $6.5 million with some Paris Club creditors. Over 170 
million lempiras in prospective government revenues coming from 
the sale of cement assets [activos] were used to finance public 
spending for the previous year. The use of domestic savings 
increased by filing promissory notes worth over 120 million 
lempiras in public retirement institutions. In addition, the 
former government did not comply with IMF goals regarding the 
nation's macro economy and public finances. This is why we 
began our government with measures leading to reorganize that 
situation, including an increase in customs compensation during 
the first days of February 1994. 
  For lack of other measures, we have had to allow the 
exchange 
rate used by sellers and buyers to stand at eight lempiras to 
the dollar. We have also had to accept a partial 
liberalization, at the import level, of oil by-products through 
the price adjustments already announced. 
  What is being branded, in the economic area, as slowness or 
hesitancy by my government is neither. On the contrary, it is 
an objective and calm evaluation on how to approach the various 
sectors to persuade them that there is no other responsible and 
serious solution. We must act honestly and adopt measures 
unfulfilled by the former government that currently affect most 
Hondurans. In addition, we are not doing this to follow 
guidelines foreign to Hondurans, but we are totally convinced 
that not adopting them would lead to an even more adverse 
situation. 
  To sum up: We received the country with negative 
international reserves, a foreign debt volume -- larger than 
1989 -- that now absorbs over 35 percent of exports and over 30 
percent of the government's budget. Honduras is a country with 
a wary and uncertain private sector, a sluggish export level, 
almost nonexistent private investment, and a contained high 
inflation level. 
  Our recommendations to Congress this month seek to rescue 
government credibility, which has been weakened since 1993 by 
the implementation of flawed economic policies. We also seek to 
obtain the support of international financial institutions and 
friendly countries for projects under way as well as new social 
projects for an amount exceeding $600 million in the coming 
three years. Thus, the country will have foreign exchange to 
meet its obligations to begin an in-depth stabilization of the 
national economy. Our proposals also seek to restore trust in 
the country's sectors and reduce the social cost to achieve an 
economic recovery as soon as possible. 
  In this regard, I urge workers and businessmen to 
immediately 
sign an economic stability plan that enables businessmen to 
establish a rational control for staple prices. These measures, 
designed to stop the decline of the purchasing power of the 
majority, are not incompatible with an adequate return on 
capital and other production factors. Our goal is to introduce 
stable criteria to maintain prices that people can afford, 
precluding speculative distortions or excessive profit margins. 
  As for the labor sector, its contribution to socioeconomic 
peace in the country would be determined by a realistic stand 
regarding demands for a salary increase. The labor sector would 
help the national recovery by adjusting their demands to the 
true situation of the productive apparatus and the pressing 
demand to increase job opportunities. In sum, workers need to 
adopt salary expectations that help diminish inflation effects 
and exorbitant price increases. 
  On the other hand, the government is bent on controlling the 
fiscal deficit and reaching a stable rate of exchange that will 
contribute to restraining inflationary prices. In turn, this 
will allow other macroeconomic variables, such as interest 
rates, to reach levels that will encourage production 
development and the creation of productive employment. 
  We expect to sign this economic stabilization agreement 
within the next few months. In this respect, interested parties 
are already cooperating with each other, and I can say with 
satisfaction that the understanding of the sectors involved 
allows us to look upon an agreement of this nature with 
optimism. This will open the door to more in-depth decisions 
and commitments with respect to prices, wages, and employment. 
  I have given instructions to transfer 100 million lempiras 
to 
Banasupro and the immediate restructuring of this institution in 
order to mitigate the situation plaguing the prices of the basic 
staples basket. This will allow the lower income groups to have 
access to essential goods by paying reasonable prices. 
  We will supply Banasupro with the items consumed daily by 
the population. The constant increase in market value of said 
items represents one of the deepest concerns for the Honduran 
household that is not part of the circle of privileged 
minorities. 
  Within the aforesaid context, I report to you with 
satisfaction that we are advancing significantly in establishing 
the national system of food security, which represents, as 
stipulated by our government program, one of the main pillars of 
the agriculture policy of the current administration. 
  We are determined to reverse the current situation of food 
insecurity within a realistic concept, one based on national 
production and not importing products. It is a matter of 
furnishing the people with essential food products in 
appropriate amounts, times, places, and at the right prices. 
  The Ministry of Natural Resources, the National Agrarian 
Institute (INA), the National Agricultural Development Bank 
(Banadesa), the Honduran Corporation for Forest Development 
(Cohdefor), the Honduran Agricultural Marketing Institute 
(IHMA), Banasupro, FHIS [Honduran Social Investment Fund], the 
Secretariat of Planning, Coordination, and Budget (Secplan), the 
organizations of producers, manufacturers, and transformers of 
agriculture products and peasant organizations, all coordinated 
through the secretary of state at the Ministry of Natural 
Resources, prepared and presented to the president of the 
Republic an integral and integrated plan for food security. I 
have already instructed that this plan be implemented during the 
present agriculture cycle, including the credit policy, 
technical assistance, the supply of inputs, the marketing 
system, and the resources for small irrigation projects. 
  Even before taking office, we expressed our constant 
interest 
in protecting and preserving the tropical dry and rain forests, 
the productive permanence of forest resources, and the 
conservation of vital processes and biodiversity. In this 
regard, we have ordered a three-month wood cutting suspension so 
as to stop the unnecessary and incomprehensible depredation of 
our forests. During this period, we will formulate and 
implement a forest policy aimed at reorganizing the forest 
administration of the state and revising its juridical framework. 
  This was done based on the fundamental principles of 
sustainable handling of the resources, multiple uses, and 
sustained output in the areas of forest interest. It is our 
objective that this policy be implemented with the participation 
of the private sector and with modern and compensatory 
techniques for exploiting the wood. This will permit our 
children and grandchildren to enjoy this wealth for a long time 
to come. 
  The wood-cutting prohibition will have special importance 
for 
the hydrograhic basin of the Francisco Morazan Dam, Yojoa lake, 
the Merendon mountain range, the Rio Platano biosphere, as well 
as the basins of such rivers as Comayagua, Cangrejal, Grande or 
Choluteca, Guayapoe, Patuca, Sico, Aguan, Wans Coco or Segovia, 
Ulua, Chamelecon, and Humuya and the regions of fragile and 
over-exploited soils. 
  Officials from Cohdefor, the Ministry of Natural Resources, 
the State Secretariat for the Environment, Secplan, and the 
corresponding municipalities and provinces will meet this month 
to coordinate and harmonize actions for enforcing the 
prohibition. The Armed Forces will offer their assistance to 
this effort. 
  The first measure of this new policy will be the absolute 
prohibition of using chain saws to cut wood and the complete 
closure of sawmills, [word indistinct] and other activities to 
cut and extract wood from the aforesaid areas. 
  Compatriots, in the Liberal Party government program for the 
1994-98 period we said: "Honduras is on the verge of an 
unprecedented energy crisis, caused by the lack of policies and 
planning in this area. In the last few years, there has been 
concern to expand the demand, but without taking provisions for 
increasing the supply." 
  The discouraging prediction has come true and the crisis 
emerged. At no time did the previous administration take the 
precautions that national and international organizations had 
recommended. 
  We have had to overcome insufficiencies in the electricity 
sector through extraordinary means, such as buying energy from 
neighboring countries, leasing new means of generation, and 
rationing the use of electricity. At this time, we can proudly 
say we have overcome the most acute part of the crisis. The 
timely and firm actions adopted by the executive branch have 
allowed us to deal with the problem from several angles. 
  Undoubtedly it is essential to resolve this problem. It is 
also necessary to implement the law on the electricity sector, 
which has been submitted to the Congress, and to restructure the 
National Enterprise for Electric Power. 
  Honduran people, As our fellow citizens know, we have 
submitted to the Legislative Assembly the law that regulates 
voluntary-educational military service. The assembly 
unanimously supported the initiative to reform the Constitution 
in order to change the mandatory military service. This new 
method of serving the fatherland, through the 
voluntary-educational military service, constituted one of the 
fundamental issues of my election campaign. Today, I can say 
with satisfaction that we have kept our promise to the people. 
  Honduran youths now have the alternative of choosing between 
a professional military service or voluntary training that will 
permit them to defend the fatherland and its institutions 
whenever it is required. In reality, this constitutes a 
historic step and is evidence that the understanding between the 
Armed Forces and civilian society is not only possible, but has 
served as a national strengthening mechanism to open new avenues 
of understanding in the future. 
  Just as we have done with the military service, in the 
coming 
days we will be taking the necessary steps to implement the code 
of ethics for public workers, which is another promise that I 
made to the people. This corps of people are a valuable 
expression of the moral revolution, which will not conclude as 
long as the corrupt actions and insidious handling of state 
affairs persist. 
  Regarding the projects and actions to be carried out in the 
medium term, they are all aimed at increasing production, 
especially of our workers. With this we will improve the 
efficiency of Honduran producers and, hence, competitive levels 
both in the national and international markets. 
  It is with this long term vision that my government has 
launched the strengthening of the agricultural and forestry 
sector initiatives. The objective is to allow the private 
sector to find a field of action in which its investments will 
have legal security and its presence can be seen by Honduran 
communities as a dynamic factor of progress. 
  Government actions, such as issuing land titles, permitting 
the free use of the land according to the law, and opening the 
forestry sector through the process of auctions will permit us 
to increase foreign investment. As an example, I can state that 
private investment in the coffee and banana sector stands at 
over $100 million, along with other products in which 
investments reached similar levels. On housing, our objective to 
build 50,000 homes in the next four years will be achieved with 
the active participation of the private sector. 
  The electricity crisis has evidenced the urgent need for 
giving guarantees so that private investors can participate in 
this sector, both in the generation and the distribution of 
electricity. Investment prospects in this sector range from 
over $200 million for immediate solutions to sums equivalent to 
$500 million for medium term solutions. 
  Regarding privatization, we will continue to include in this 
process several state enterprises, or some of their branches, 
such as the Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise [Hondutel]. 
I have expanded the privatization commission to give it greater 
representation and sufficient moral authority so that it can 
present the method of privatization of Hondutel and inform the 
people about it. This privatization could generate over $400 
million in the next three years. This would allow us to achieve 
not only a more efficient telephone service, but also an influx 
of foreign exchange that would also permit us to achieve the 
objective of contributing to create foreign exchange stability 
and vast resources to finance the social action program to fight 
poverty. 
  Various sectors have initiated a public discussion on the 
interests of foreign investors in building a large refinery in 
Puerto Castilla. This debate must continue so the people and 
the government are convinced that we are abiding by our 
environmental protection laws as well as of the real benefits 
this $2-billion investment would represent for Honduras. 
  As for the benefits, we can plainly state that such a 
significant investment will help us attract more foreign 
investment. As president of all Hondurans, I urge investors to 
follow the example of those foreigners and show their patriotism 
and confidence in the prevailing investment conditions by 
increasing their business activities. It is true these 
investments could lead to an annual economic growth rate of 5 
percent in real terms, but the generation of new employment 
sources will not end there. 
  In the industrial area, we will give preferential treatment 
to small and intermediate industries and establish programs for 
micro-entrepreneurs. We already have specific projects that 
could receive support from international financial institutions. 
The projects we have in mind exceed $100 million, including 
resources for an industrial reconversion operation pending since 
1993. 
  We will meet our announced goal of increasing by 100,000 the 
number of workers in the industrial processing areas. We have 
decided that these industrial centers should operate in 
different locations of the country to generate local jobs. 
  As for the social aspect and the reactivation of productive 
sectors, we have negotiated and continue to negotiate $600 
million in nonreimbursable loans from foreign cooperation 
programs for the 1994-97 period. Thus we will develop and 
strengthen areas such as health; education; production training; 
potable water and sewage treatment; agricultural-livestock 
production and irrigation; environmental protection; support for 
private enterprises, especially small and micro enterprises; 
tourism; and various aspects of government reform, particularly 
regarding the legal system, municipal decentralization, and 
administrative reform. 
  Our agricultural-livestock policies deserve special 
recognition. Regarding property, particularly agrarian reform, 
we will immediately conduct a thorough evaluation of this 
program and the corresponding legislation. This evaluation will 
help us draft an effective program to reinstate peasants in the 
productive process. We will guarantee landownership by issuing 
property deeds and by establishing an official land register, 
both of which are essential for agricultural credit. 
  The Natural Resources minister, as head of the agricultural 
public sector, the executive director of the INA, and the 
president of Banadesa, will submit the evaluation to me three 
months from today. Meanwhile, my administration has allocated 
120 million lempiras to finance basic grains in the current 
agricultural period. Banadesa contributed 30 million of the 120 
million lempiras. 
  Regarding children, we have already thoroughly evaluated the 
progress made in implementing the national plan to help 
children. This national initiative includes goals and specific 
resources geared toward increasing protection and improving 
living conditions for children, specifically those facing 
difficult circumstances. Major advances in this aspect include 
the latest inoculation campaign, which reached over 90 percent 
of the children, the certified eradication of polio, and a 
strong fight against cholera. 
  The first lady is reorganizing the programs of the National 
Social Welfare Board to more effectively orient attention to 
abandoned children, children who are the most socioeconomically 
vulnerable. The first lady is focusing in particular on street 
children, orphans, and children who work. Health, water, and 
environmental sanitation are fundamental to healthy and 
productive living conditions. The health care system is being 
rehabilitated and strengthened, and we have earmarked an initial 
28 million lempiras increase for medicine. Beginning Thursday, 
12 May, the ministers will issue detailed reports on what we are 
doing and what we intend to do in investments and short- and 
medium-term plans. 
  Fellow citizens, No one should be surprised that in a 
society 
in which democracy is the form of coexistence, demands and 
requirements often emerge silencing dictatorships. We will 
never oppose people's demands when they are based on justice and 
equality. Such events, in any case, must be channeled within 
the legal framework and must have as boundaries the right of 
others and the common interest. 
  Premature or unjustified strikes, forceful takeovers of 
private or public properties, such as roads and public buildings 
are reproachable means of vindicating rights or groups' 
accomplishments. This is particularly true in a government that 
keeps the avenues of communication and understanding open. 
  We hope our working class and their leaders can understand 
our position and end these actions. We have enough means in the 
nation's juridical arsenal to achieve said objectives. Before 
this year is over, we will reform labor legislation in agreement 
with workers and businessmen so that this instrument, according 
to the most modern concepts, defines the steps that must be 
followed when conflicts between workers and businessmen emerge. 
  This is the dawn of a new era in worker-employer relations, 
in which increases in productivity and adapting to technological 
advancements are essential factors for achieving development 
that favors all. In this new atmosphere, which paves the way 
for greater competitive capacity in the markets, the 
confrontation and antagonism of classes must be overcome through 
negotiations and within a framework of growth with equality. 
  The aforesaid statement is part of the juridical-political 
security that must prevail in the state. Arbitrary actions must 
be eliminated for always from all sectors of society. 
  Fellow countrymen, in case of social conflicts stirred by 
groups and unions, as commander in chief of the Armed Forces, I 
instructed them to pledge themselves to safeguarding public 
order, preventing violent abuses, and letting courts solve 
conflicts based upon the stateliness of juridical laws. 
  As for the modernization of the state, among other efforts 
we 
will make, I hereby announce that we will create conditions 
under which municipalities may have full autonomy immediately. 
The following issues will have the same priority: the 
reorganization of the internal and external supervision of the 
executive branch; juridical and institutional reforms of the 
system of constitutional rights; the defense, strengthening, and 
development of human rights, and the strengthening of the 
Attorney General's Office, as well as sweeping reform of the 
judicial system. 
  As for international relations, we have progressed in tune 
with the new world order. Our joining the UN Security Council 
in January 1995 is praiseworthy. We are living in special times 
on the international scene: the end of apartheid in South 
Africa, the return of the Central American sister nations to 
social welfare programs, the opening up of international 
financial institutions to programs and actions to help the 
lowest-income sectors. All these achievements confirm our 
commitment with the people, especially with poor sectors. 
  Fellow countrymen, the great national consensus on 
extracting the country from its most serious and terrible 
problems was formed when the people overwhelmingly entrusted us 
with steering the nation's destiny. We now have to translate 
that ample consensus into widespread and local endeavors that 
will emanate from an agreement among all interested parties. 
  We have already started that significant task with some of 
the country's most important unions and political parties. We 
have met with teacher and labor union representatives to discuss 
the serious problems we are currently facing that so affect our 
nation, in the firm conviction that this is the path to greater 
milestones in Honduran history. 
  We will achieve those projects on which we have already 
embarked with said groups as soon as possible with the help of 
other sectors by signing, with the support of all, a social pact 
that will commit us to ensuring that everyone will benefit. 
This is how we will inaugurate a national plan needed by the 
country to follow a clear and certain path with a view to the 
challenges that the end of the millennium and the century pose. 
  This is the path I promised as part of my platform when I 
said: "It is essential for all the nation's sectors to sign a 
social pact to establish the basis for reaching a national 
consensus on such nationally important issues as national 
identity, civilian participation, reform and modernization of 
the state, economic reactivation and recovery, equitable growth, 
improvement of the domestic market, regional integration and 
economic internationalization, human development, environmental 
protection, and sustainable development. This government 
program constitutes the Liberal Party's contribution toward 
reaching said social pact and is complemented by operational 
measures that include, among other items, administrative 
decentralization and financial and operational restructuring of 
certain public institutions and organizations." 
  As a candidate, I said I would promise the people only what 
I 
could deliver; as president, I am keeping my word. We have kept 
our promises by selecting a capable working team, by eliminating 
confidential accounts, and by creating a volunteer and 
educational military service. We also reactivated the FHIS and 
revived the program of bonuses for mothers who are heads of 
household; we returned investigative services to civilian 
control and broadened judicial reforms and the modernization of 
the state. 
  We are currently consolidating the national convergence 
process. We are also honoring our international commitments and 
negotiating the best possible conditions for the people. All of 
this in only 100 days of government. 
  Those who talk about lack of action or lack of cohesion in 
the administrative arena have eyes that do not see and ears that 
do not hear; they are unaware of how much time it takes to 
organize a new government. Instead of making constructive 
criticism that will help guide action that can benefit national 
causes, they seek only to satisfy their personal interests and 
expect the moral revolution to fail, thus ensuring that they 
will remain hidden behind impunity and will return to power only 
to usufruct it to the detriment of Honduras. 
  As president of all Hondurans, I salute all my fellow 
countrymen and invite them all to work courageously and 
continuously to ensure that the material goods and spiritual 
values to which are entitled will blossom in our land.

<F P=106> [Speech by President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares on the </F>
occasion of being officially proclaimed the winner of the 8 May 
presidential elections at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama 
City--live] 
  [Text] Members of the National Vote-Counting Board, 
magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, candidates here with us 
this evening, ladies and gentlemen: 
  Regardless of who has been the protagonist, Panama's 
democracy and the people of Panama very much wanted an event 
such as today's, an event in which a group of trustworthy 
citizens have clearly confirmed the verdict of the polls. 
  In Panama, thanks to men and women like you, the democratic 
consolidation process, which in other regions takes decades, has 
been accomplished in a very short period of time and has been 
built on very solid bases. This is the conclusion of an effort 
that has earned the praise of the foreign media and has been a 
surprise for some of our own fellow citizens. 
  Disputes, recriminations, confrontations, and arguments are 
now behind us, and behind us are also, let's hope forever, 
political campaigns stained by violence and elections blemished 
by doubts. 
  The country began to change beginning early Monday morning, 
not because one or another candidate had secured the majority of 
the votes of the Panamanians, but because everybody accepted 
unaffectedly and like a gentleman the results of the previous 
day. 
  Those of us who have acquired the commitment of promoting 
reconciliation in the country, accept it with joy but calmly, 
enthusiastically but without any intention of boasting before 
others about this privilege from the voters. 
  I must also say, and let this be a public tribute of 
respect, 
that our adversaries exhibited the patriotic altruism and the 
political generosity of closing, on the elections night, the 
wounds that the political confrontation could have opened. 
  They also deserve our homage. [applause] 
  In January 1990, taking a step that at that time was not 
understood, I visited President Endara to express our 
dissatisfaction with some measures that had been adopted. I told 
him that I categorically would initiate an opposition to his 
government. He told me that during his mandate, a democratic 
opposition would enjoy broad guarantees. 
  Today I must acknowledge, very sincerely, that I opposed his 
government and that President Endara showed respect for the 
opposition. This acknowledgment is necessary today because all 
of us have witnessed his effort to pave the road to an orderly 
transfer of power. 
  I cannot mention all the persons who made the democratic 
fiesta we now enjoy possible. But it would be unfair of me to 
fail to point out the exemplary behavior of the Public Force, 
yesterday arbiter of politics, and now the guarantor of 
constitutionality. The Justice and Peace Commission and the 
electoral delegates deserve the same public admiration. The 
respect they earned and the impartiality they exhibited were 
enough to quench infrequent outbreaks of violence and to 
guarantee to the citizens that this electoral struggle would see 
only three weapons: ideas, enthusiasm, and votes. 
  Since all the citizens, regardless of age or sex, were the 
true heroes of this democratic event, I want to conclude my 
statement by paying homage of respect and admiration to the 
three forefathers who, to the satisfaction and pride of 
everybody, comprise, and let us hope, will continue to comprise, 
the Electoral Tribunal. [applause] 
  They made us get used to listening to a song whose words are 
now a beautiful truth: We are the builders of the fatherland! 
  Thank you! [applause]

industrialist Gabriel Lewis Galindo, Christian Democratic 
Legislator Jose Antonio Sossa, and cattle rancher Carlos Sousa 
Lennox have accepted cabinet positions in the administration of 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares. This has been

Galindo, presidential candidate for Solidarity Party who came in 
next to last in Sunday's election. 
  Sossa, who accepted the post of attorney general, is a 
founding member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), a 
traditional and staunch adversary of the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party]. 
  Sousa Lennox, linked to the ruling Arnulfist Party and 
former 
president of the National Association of Cattlemen (Anagan), 
will be the minister of agricultural development (Mida). 
  Research by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA disclosed on Sunday as an 
exclusive report said that Perez Balladares has offered the 
Public Health Ministry to Carlos Garcia de Paredes, Raul (Baby) 
Arango Gasteazoro will hold the Ministry of the Presidency, 
Mitchel Doens will be the Ministry of Government and Justice, 
and Felix Gonzalez Santizo will be the minister of commerce and 
industries. 
  The Education Ministry has been offered to Stanley Muschett, 
rector of the Santa Maria La Antigua University (USMA) and 
chairman of the Justice and Peace Commission. 
  According to Perez Balladares, the other ministries will be 
held by PRD members, while Comptroller General Jose Chen 
Barria--also from the PDC--might be ratified in his post.

<F P=106> [Statement by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential </F>
candidate of the Arnulfista Party in the 8 May presidential 
elections, in Panama City on 11 May--recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening, dear reporters. This evening, I 
gathered the Arnulfista Party's National Directorate and 
Consultative Board to discuss with them the offer made to me by 
Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares of two cabinet ministries in his 
administration. 
  The National Directorate and Consultative Board have issued 
the following statement in response to the offer made to the 
Arnulfista Party. It is a unanimous decision, and it states: 
  The National Directorate and Consultative Board of the 
Arnulfista Party, faithful to the doctrine and thinking of Dr. 
Arnulfo Arias, categorically and definitively reject the 
proposal to occupy ministries in the next administration. 
  The Arnulfista Party's ever upright position will be to 
defend, to the utmost consequences, the freedom and democracy 
the Panamanian people are enjoying today under the leadership 
and guarantees of an Arnulfista administration. 
  I reiterate that our glorious party's position will be to 
carry out a clear, constructive, and patriotic opposition, thus 
giving content and solidity to the authentic democracy for which 
the civic-minded fought and of which we are the most legitimate 
guardians. [applause]

  [Text] President Itamar Franco has met with his ministers 
and decided to keep the Federal Police buildings under Army 
control today. Late this afternoon, the president will again 
meet with the ministers of strategic sectors to review the 
decision on the Army presence at Federal Police facilities. 
  During last night's meeting at Planalto Palace, the 
president, the military ministers, Justice Minister Alexandre 
Dupeyrat, and Federal Administrative Secretary Ronaldo Canhim 
analyzed the Federal Police strike for two and a half hours. 
  President Franco decided to maintain the security measures 
that were adopted on Wednesday until today, Friday. The 
measures are considered essential for the rendering of essential 
services and to preserve public property. 
  Late this afternoon, the president will again meet with the 
ministers to reassess the strike and a proposal to withdraw the 
military troops, which was made by the national defense 
committee of the Chamber of Deputies. The president will then 
decide whether he will maintain Federal Police buildings and 
stations under Army control.

  [Text] President Itamar Franco has determined that the Army 
troops currently occupying Federal Police [PF] facilities should 
return to barracks. Here is Alexandre Garcia's live report from 
Brasilia: 
  [Garcia] After a 150-minute cabinet meeting to evaluate the 
situation, President Franco decided to order the Army troops to 
return to barracks wherever this is possible. In writing, 
however, he left a warning. He said that whenever and wherever 
abusive attitudes by striking movements take place, the 
government will use all the instruments at its disposal to 
maintain order, although it recognizes citizens' right to strike. 
  Planalto Palace reported the governmental decision to the 
president of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee a few 
moments ago. He reported the news to the strike command, which 
has been holding a meeting with the National Defense Committee 
at the Chamber of Deputies. 
  The committee president said that during the evaluation 
meeting, it was established that the president of the Republic 
acted firmly and openly, and that today he used his common sense 
when he realized that the troops could be withdrawn. 
  A few minutes ago, the president of the National Federation 
of Federal Policemen -- Francisco Garisto -- said that during 
the 52 days of the strike several abuses had been committed, and 
that this brought about the military intervention. He added 
that from now on such abuses will be avoided, to show the 
president of the Republic that the strike is seeking purely to 
ensure better salaries for the PF. As a result of today's 
detente, he said, negotiations can be resumed. Garisto also 
asserted to the president of the National Defense Committee that 
beginning tomorrow, 30 percent of the PF contingents will 
perform essential services, without again upsetting the people. 
They will resume control of airports; border posts, including 
Foz do Iguacu; passports issuance; control of penitentiaries; 
and drug enforcement operations.

  [Text] Federal Deputy Aloizio Mercadante managed to undo 
with just one phrase all the effort made by PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva during the past 
five days to win the confidence of U.S. bankers and investors. 
Lula invited Mercadante to go with him to the United States as 
the PT's leading economist. During a lecture for 800 bankers, 
Mercadante yesterday said that he would give "a big headache to 
Bill Rhodes." In this he was alluding to William Rhodes, the 
representative of the steering committee for Brazil's creditor 
banks. The phrase caused great displeasure, and to the audience 
sounded like a threat. Lula sought to minimize the issue, but 
the U.S. investors still left the meeting fearing that a PT 
government would eventually break the recent debt agreement.

  [Text] Brasilia, 12 May (EFE) -- Political sources have 
reported here today that the U.S. Government has asserted to 
Brazilian Socialist presidential candidate Luis Inacio "Lula" da 
Silva this week in Washington that it will remain neutral 
regarding the 3 October general elections to be held in Brazil. 
  Workers Party (PT) leader Lula da Silva, 48, is the favorite 
in the upcoming presidential elections. 
  After meeting Alexander Watson, the U.S. assistant secretary 
of state for inter-American affairs, in Washington on 11 May, Da 
Silva said: "It is very important that a country such as the 
United States maintain the impartial position President Bill 
Clinton has been postulating regarding the Brazilian elections." 
  The Socialist presidential candidate will return to Brazil 
today, after a five-day visit to Washington, New York, and 
Boston. During the trip he met officials of the U.S. executive 
branch and Congress, and gave several lectures at Harvard and 
other universities. 
  Da Silva told Watson that he opposes the U.S. embargo 
against 
Cuba because it punishes the Cuban people. He added that he 
also opposes the choice of Miami -- where most anti-Castro 
Cubans live -- as the venue for the summit of American chiefs of 
state convened by Bill Clinton for 9 and 10 December. 
  The PT leader has defended the idea that Cuban President 
Fidel Castro, who has not been invited, should participate in 
the summit.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luiz Longo in Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] A Workers Party [PT] document on the current 
situation is urging PT members, union leaders, and supporters to 
mobilize against the salary shrinkage provoked by the Real Plan. 
The drafters of the document believe the PT should promote a 
national movement calling for structural reforms in the country. 
They thus consider it essential that the party, its economists, 
and congressmen launch an offensive to publicly fight the plan. 
  The call for a mobilization against the economic plan is 
made 
in a document entitled "The Current Situation and Our Campaign 
Strategy," which was drafted by a committee appointed by the PT 
national executive board and approved at the PT national meeting 
in Brasilia on 1 May. 
  Coordinators of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's campaign believe 
that unfulfilled social and salary demands at this time will 
later result in a wave of demands on the future government. 
They deny, however, charges that they are instigating political 
strikes to benefit Lula's campaign. 
  Economist Joao Machado, who is the deputy coordinator of the 
PT program, said: "The fact is that the PT is urging all those 
who are unhappy with the government's plan to vent their 
dissatisfaction. It is ridiculous, however, to charge us with 
instigating political strikes."

  [Text] New York -- Luis Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday 
denied here reports that the Workers Party [PT] is seeking to 
foment chaos through a wave of strikes with a view to 
jeopardizing the government's economic plan and, consequently, 
undermining the candidacy of Brazilian Social Democracy Party 
[PSDB] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Lula denied having 
masterminded a maneuver to unleash election-oriented strikes. 
He said that these strikes are just "a reflection of the 
government's incompetence." 
  Lula said: "Instead of taking the appropriate measures the 
government, out of sheer lack of competence, is trying to blame 
us for something over which we have absolutely no 
responsibility. It is absurd to charge the PT with fomenting 
these strikes. The de facto regime used to make this type of 
charge." 
  In Lula's opinion, the strikes are being motivated by salary 
demands alone. He said: "The strikes are a result of this 
faltering economic program. The problem is clearly economic; it 
is devoid of any ideological content." 
  During a meeting he held on 11 May with Sterie Beza, 
director 
of the IMF Western Hemisphere Department, at the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) in Washington, Lula promised some sort of 
future agreement should he be elected president. After hearing 
Lula explain his economic program and asking for more details 
about his stabilization and revenue policy, Beza, who supervises 
all the IMF negotiations with the Brazilian Government, said: 
"If this is the case, it will be great. Remember, however, 
that if you win the elections I will expect you to keep your 
promises." 
  Lula said: "Perfect. Just remember that I will remind the 
IMF about the evaluation you have just made of our plan."

  [Text] Last Saturday, a flock of ministers, governors, and 
mayors who had resigned their posts before the end of their 
terms of office took flight to try their luck at the ballot box 
on 3 October. Ten of the 27 governors elected in 1990 stepped 
down. Only one of them, Leonel Brizola of Rio de Janeiro, 
announced on Good Friday that he will run for the presidency. 
The others plan to compete for Senate seats, a race that is 
never easy but will be relatively pleasant. In 1994, there are 
two senatorial vacancies in each state -- a situation that 
offers each contender twice the chances of victory as in 1990, 
when only one seat was available. The last governor to make a 
decision was Geraldo Bulhoes, of Alagoas. Until very early 
Saturday morning, Bulhoes was in Maceio putting together a 
"superslate" inspired by the big man himself, former President 
Fernando Collor. The name of Rosane Collor came up at the 
negotiating table, but was promptly rejected by the former 
president. Interested in running for a Chamber seat, his wife, 
toalheira Denilma Bulhoes was hoping until the last 
minute that her husband would resign and thus remove any legal 
obstacle to her own campaign. 
  Besides FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso], two other stars 
from 
the Itamar Franco campaign, left office at the last minute: 
Mauricio Correa, who left Justice to run for governor of the 
Federal District, and Walter Barelli, of Labor, who is being 
considered as candidate for lieutenant governor of Sao Paulo on 
a slate with tucano Mario Covas. Among mayors of 
state capitals, all sworn in 15 months ago, the most notable 
departure is that of Dante de Oliveira, from Cuiaba, who will 
run for the governorship of Mato Grosso under the PDT 
[Democratic Labor Party] banner. Their chances for success and 
the reasons that led governors and mayors to enter the race 
vary, but all took as their starting point a decisive factor -- 
the opinion polls. Nowadays no candidate makes decisions based 
on the enthusiasm or the advice of his friends. They decide on 
the basis of research institute surveys. 
  A month ago, when he ranked second in the polls among 
candidates for Planalto Palace, Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf 
announced his "irrevocable" decision to run for president. Last 
week, when the same polls reported he had been overtaken by 
Fernando Henrique, Maluf summoned the press and read a statement 
in which he said: "I am a candidate for president...in 1998." 
Another poll encouraged him to make the same decision. Eight out 
of 10 respondents who had voted for Maluf said they were opposed 
to his stepping down as mayor. Before making his final decision, 
he listened to some advice, and later, a promise. "If those who 
voted for you don't want you to run, it would be wiser not to," 
Deputy Antonio Delfim Netto told him. 
  On Monday, Maluf had dinner with businessman Roberto 
Marinho, 
of Globo Network. "He told me that if I were to run, he would 
wish me luck, but that I am young and can wait," Maluf himself 
revealed. "He said that if I run, he would treat me fairly, 
which is saying quite a bit." On Tuesday in Brasilia, Maluf met 
with top PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] leaders and heard the 
same suggestion. "You are like Corinthians [a Sao Paulo soccer 
team], the paulistanos' emotional favorite, and you 
cannot let them down," Senator Esperidiao Amin told him. "You 
could run, but the people want you to stay." It is true that the 
PFL's [Liberal Front Party] preference for Fernando Henrique 
also influenced Maluf's decision. But the absence of allies has 
never played a decisive role in the mayor's decisions. Since 
1978, he has run for president twice, sought the governorship 
three times (winning once, in an indirect election), run twice 
for mayor (and won once), and tried for and won a seat as 
federal deputy in 1982. If Maluf's ratings had been better in 
1994, there is no doubt he would have stayed in the race. 
<H5>  Free Sample </H5>
  The year 1994 is different from 1989 because of a crucial 
element. The election five years ago was for a single office. 
Twenty-two candidates for president flooded the first round. 
Most were merely adventurers who entered the contest without the 
slightest chance of victory and without letting that bother 
them. They were interested in giving voters a free sample for 
the 1990 elections, when governorships, the Senate, the Chamber 
of Deputies, and seats in state legislatures would be at stake. 
The 1994 elections will cover all those posts at one time. There 
will not be another chance like this until 1998 when, as was 
approved in the constitutional revision, "joint" elections will 
be held again. The only opportunity between now and then will 
come in 1996, but those will be municipal elections -- for mayor 
and city councilmen. 
<H5>  Key to the Vault </H5>
  "We won't see any `parachutist' candidates in 1994, the ones 
who enter today's race so they can try to win tomorrow's," 
explained Professor Francisco Weffort, of the University of Sao 
Paulo. "Anyone who runs now is really serious about it." A 
typical feature of a "joint" [casada] election are 
the alliances, which are very important. A candidate for the 
presidency needs solid support in each state if he is to prevent 
an internal hemorrhage of his electorate. Likewise, a candidate 
for governor will try to ally himself with a presidential 
candidate who would help to fill, rather than empty, his basket 
of votes. The government apparatus is another ingredient in the 
mortar between the bricks of this state/federal edifice. That 
mass of public funds, jobs, and influence helps explain why 17 
governors decided to remain in office. 
  "I cannot just hand over to Fernando Henrique a state 
government like that of Rio Grande do Sul," admitted Governor 
Alceu Collares, a Brizola campaign worker who, were he to leave 
Piratini, would have to turn over the key to the vault to his 
lieutenant, tucano Joao Gilberto Coelho, from whom he 
is estranged. An identical situation prevails in Ciro Gomes's 
Ceara State, but the party banners are reversed. 
Tucano Ciro Gomes is popular enough to run for and 
easily win a seat in the Senate. His headache is his lieutenant 
governor, Lucio Alcantara, a brizolista who was 
demanding his share of the government pie even before the 
campaign began. Apprehensive, last week Ciro Gomes said he would 
wait until his term ends before starting studies at Harvard 
University in the United States. 
<H5>  Reheated Cafe au Lait </H5>
  Whether to stay in government or leave prematurely is a 
decision that each politician also makes on the basis of his own 
performance. Most Bahia voters believe Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes [ACM] is doing an excellent job, and he said farewell 
to the post in grand style last week to run for the Senate. His 
final act was to free 154 prisoners who had been jailed for 
petty theft, such as stealing a package of candy or a pair of 
glasses. Always with an eye to topics that can seize the voters' 
attention, ACM explained his gesture as a protest "in a country 
where the judiciary never takes action against the rich." 
  In a different situation are the governors of the country's 
most populous and wealthiest states: Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho 
of Sao Paulo, and Helio Garcia, of Minas Gerais. On the 
popularity list among governors, Fleury ranks just above Helio 
Garcia, who is next-to-last. The booby prize belongs to Leonel 
Brizola. Fleury and Helio Garcia spent the last few months 
cooking up conversations in an atmosphere of mystery. They even 
gave the impression they were reheating the old cafe au lait of 
the Old Republic. Actually, Fleury was playing at being a 
presidential candidate until Orestes Quercia reentered the 
ticket-taker's booth at the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] amusement park. On behalf of the Minas distillery, Garcia 
tried to hitch a ride as vice president on Fernando Henrique's 
slate. Turned down, he had neither the heart nor the ratings to 
attempt a run for the Senate. 
[Box pp 30-31] 
<H5>  Dance of the Governors </H5>

  -  Goias: Governor Iris Rezende, of the PMDB, will 
run for the Senate. Since Lieutenant Governor Maguito Vilela 
will be a candidate for governor, the state will be governed by 
the president of the state legislature, Agenor Rodrigues de 
Rezende, of the PMDB. 
  -  Brasilia: Singed by the Budget 
CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], Governor Joaquim 
Roriz of the PP [Progressive Party] announced he will stay put. 
He will try to get his public works secretary, Jose Roberto 
Arruda, elected to succeed him. 
  -  Parana: Governor 
Roberto Requiao of the PMDB resigned to seek his party's 
nomination for president. If he is not successful, he will run 
for the Senate. In his place will be Lieutenant Governor Mario 
Pereira, his former transportation secretary. 
  -  Rio Grande 
do Sul: Governor Alceu Collares, of the PDT, said he is 
staying in office. He does not want to hand over the 
governorship to his lieutenant, tucano Joao Gilberto, 
with whom he is not on speaking terms. 
  -  Ceara: 
Tucano Governor Ciro Gomes, Brazil's most 
popular, with a 69 percent approval rating, announced he will 
stay on. Tasso Jereissati, president of the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party], may be a candidate to succeed 
him. 
  -  Pernambuco: Governor Joaquim Francisco, of the 
PFL [Liberal Front Party], said he will serve out his full term. 
At the last minute, Recife Mayor Jarbas Vasconcelos, of the 
PMDB, announced he is staying. He gave up the idea of running 
for the state governorship in an alliance forged with Joaquim 
Francisco to defeat Miguel Arraes, the candidate of the PSB-PT 
[Brazilian Socialist Party/Workers Party] 
coalition. 
  -  Bahia: Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, 
of the PFL, resigned to run for the Senate. Lieutenant Governor 
Paulo Souto is a candidate for governor, and the president of 
the state Assembly, Antonio Imbassahy, will run for the Chamber. 
So, Bahia will be governed by the president of the Court of 
Justice, Ruy Trindade, who will call indirect elections in 30 
days. Likely to be chosen is state Transportation Secretary 
Raimundo Britto. 
  -  Minas Gerais: Governor Helio Garcia, 
of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], tried until the last minute 
to step down to become Fernando Henrique's running mate. 
Unsuccessful, he called a press conference to say that he will 
serve out his term. 
  -  Rio de Janeiro: Governor Leonel 
Brizola, the country's least popular governor, left office to 
run for president. Nilo Garcia, his lieutenant and current 
secretary of the Civil Police, will take over. 
  -  Sao 
Paulo: Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, of the PMDB, 
will remain in office and support the presidential candidacy of 
his political godfather, Orestes Quercia. Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo 
Maluf gave up the idea of running for president and will stay 
until the end of his mandate. 
  -  Santa Catarina: 
Governor Vilson Kleinubing, of the PFL, will try for the Senate, 
or for the vice presidency on Fernando Henrique's slate. He will 
pass on the post to his lieutenant governor, Antonio Carlos 
Konder Reis, of the PPR. Reis is a cousin of Jorge Bornhausen, 
president of the PFL.

  [Text] Two sailors from a Cuban ship anchored in Lirquen, 
in the Eighth Region, have requested political asylum in Chile. 
  The ship, carrying a Cuban flag and named Primer Congreso 
del 
Partido, arrived in Chile on 26 April from Chimbote, Peru, with 
a 29-member crew. This ship anchored in Lirquen to load 3,000 
tons of fishmeal. 
  [Begin Lirquen Customs Official Rene Lobos recording] The 
ship left at 0130 and is now sailing around Lirquen Bay. [end 
recording] 
  The two sailors who defected have been identified as Orlando 
Mayo Lopez, physician, and Wilfredo Falaro Escandon, cook. They 
both come from Havana and arrived last night, at approximately 
2200, at the Investigative Police station in Concepcion. 
  [Begin Concepcion Investigative Police Official Oscar Barra 
recording] What they want is for Chilean authorities to help 
them travel to Miami, where they have some relatives and job 
opportunities. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are they asking for political 
asylum? 
  [Barra] That is more or less what they want, but they do not 
know the legal term. [end recording] 
  The two Cubans remain at the Investigative Police station as 
guests and have refused, so far, to meet with the media. They 
are awaiting the decision of administrative authorities. 
  [Begin Regional Ministry Secretariat General of the 
Government Ariel Duffan recording] According to preliminary 
investigations and to what they are requesting, they are not 
entitled to political asylum because they are not being 
persecuted for political reasons, and they have not committed 
any crime that would entitle them to be granted political 
asylum. [end recording] 
  The captain of the Cuban ship Primer Congreso del Partido 
has 
been identified as Manuel Fuentes Sainz. 
  It is uncertain, however, when the Cuban ship will leave the 
port of Lirquen, because in addition to the two sailors that 
have defected, it has engine problems. 
  A third Cuban citizen also defected from his ship anchored 
in 
Iquique. The sailor from the Cuban ship Olguin, who has been 
identified as Alay Gimenez, escaped in Iquique and requested 
asylum. 
  Interior Under Secretary Belisario Velasco said that the 
situation of the three Cubans who have requested political 
asylum in Chile is being assessed. Velasco said that Interpol 
would be consulted before any decision is made.

  [Text] The Carabineros building was again the center of 
attention in view of [Carabineros Director] General Stange's 
return. For the second consecutive day, Gen. Stange, who is 
still on leave, went to his office where he met with members of 
the Carabineros Superior Advisory Council. 
  Gen. Carlos Pecchi, the Carabineros Legal Department chief, 
stated later that there is no legal reason why Gen. Stange 
should not return to duty on 17 May, adding that this is what he 
will do. 
  The Chilean Communist Party mouthpiece EL SIGLO has reported 
that Stange's return would prompt a cabinet crisis that will 
culminate in the resignation of Interior Minister German Correa. 
  [Begin recording] [Correa] That is not true. I will not 
answer reports published in EL SIGLO which is completely 
misinformed and has no idea of what is happening in this country. 
  [First unidentified reporter] Do you believe there is a 
campaign against you or your administration? 
  [Correa] No, but obviously there are some who dislike my 
presence at the Interior Ministry. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] What is the government's 
reaction to statements by [Stange's] Lawyer Pablo Rodriguez who 
insists that Gen. Stange will resume his post on 17 May. 
  [Correa] I have carefully not commented on this to avoid 
making it a household issue. It is a delicate issue that the 
government is handling with the required prudence. [end 
recording] 
  Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister secretary general of the 
government, held an unscheduled meeting with Defense Minister 
Edmundo Perez Yoma. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] It seems Gen. Stange's return 
is 
imminent. What is the government's stance regarding his return. 
  [Rebolledo] I decline to comment on future developments. We 
are obviously discussing the issue. [end recording] 
  Some hours later, Minister Rebolledo again discussed the 
issue in Temuco. 
  [Begin Rebolledo recording] Gen. Stange should stay away 
from 
the Carabineros headquarters while the case is under 
investigation and remain on leave. [end recording] 
  The issue continued to be discussed at the Presidential 
Resort in Cerro Castillo in Vina del Mar where Interior Minister 
German Correa held meetings with Coalition of Parties for 
Democracy leaders and legislators. During this meeting, Correa 
stated that the Carabineros had officially informed him that 
Gen. Stange will resume his duties on 17 May.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Augusto Pinochet, Army commander in </F>
chief, by Cristian Bofill in Santiago on 6 April] 
  [Excerpts] Welcoming QUE PASA into his spacious office on 
the fourth floor of the Armed Forces Building late in the 
morning of 6 April, General Augusto Pinochet seemed anxious to 
give the impression that he was uninvolved in the crisis that 
had erupted the previous day in the big building that can be 
seen from his office window. No matter how hard he tries to hide 
it, however, he knows that everyone is aware of his key role in 
these events. When he occupied the choicest office at La Moneda, 
he was instrumental in the first chapter of the current 
imbroglio, which culminated with the resignation of General 
Cesar Mendoza. Now, given the weight his opinion carries in the 
Armed Forces, he has a monumental influence on what happens in 
the crisis that has placed General Rodolfo Stange's head on the 
block. The general had agreed to this interview before the 
crisis broke, and it was supposed to focus on the release of the 
second part of Volume 3 of his memoirs and on his current 
concerns. In the event, however, the general revealed some 
valuable hints about his position on this new chapter. He also 
discussed a number of other issues, such as his relations with 
the current government, his conversations with Margaret 
Thatcher, and the wasted opportunity to privatize the Copper 
Corporation (Codelco). 
  [Bofill] When you were president, the case of the beheadings 
came to light, and the solution adopted was the departure of 
Cesar Mendoza, then director general of the Carabineros. Do you 
think that the same thing should be done now with Gen. Rodolfo 
Stange? 
  [Pinochet] I did not oust Gen. Mendoza. That case led to a 
series of problems that raised many obstacles. The general chose 
to tender his resignation and to clear the way for the removal 
of obstacles. It was his decision. 
  [Bofill] Did you suggest to him at that time that he obey 
his 
conscience, as the current government has done in the case of 
Gen. Stange? 
  [Pinochet] To tell someone to obey his conscience, you have 
to be rather monastic, rather...ascetic. 
  [Bofill] Why? 
  [Pinochet] Because you cannot have a devil selling crosses. 
It is like having a sinful person tell another person not to 
commit sins. There is a reason why Christ said that he who was 
without sin should cast the first stone, and no one threw any 
stones. What we have now is a whole lot of Pharisees casting the 
first stone. That has to be examined very closely. This problem 
is very deep; it has other facets. 
  [Bofill] What other facets? 
  [Pinochet] There is a trial that has not finished yet. It is 
in progress. The final word has not been spoken. As I said, you 
have to look at other facets. As for the comparison with the 
case of Gen. Mendoza, this is quite different. Mendoza, who 
wanted to clear up matters, was a member of the Military Junta. 
He was in the government. But now Gen. Stange is only director 
general of the Carabineros. He does not have any government 
responsibilities, as the other general did. 
  [Bofill] Aside from that difference, do you believe that 
Gen. 
Stange should step down? 
  [Pinochet] That is up to him. I cannot tell him whether he 
should resign. I do not know. I cannot get into Gen. Stange's 
head. 
  [Bofill] It is known that Gen. Stange has talked to you and 
asked for your opinion. What did you tell him? 
  [Pinochet] You are wrong. I have not talked to Gen. Stange 
about this matter. 
  [Bofill] But you do, at least, admit that you have talked 
about it with Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma? 
  [Pinochet] What I have talked about with the defense 
minister 
are matters related to the Army and the ministry. We have talked 
about the military missions and the visits he plans to make to 
Army units. I have not discussed this issue with either Gen. 
Stange or the defense minister. 
  [Bofill] Does that mean that your position on the matter 
will 
be made public only if the government convenes the National 
Security Council to propose the retirement of Gen. Stange? 
  [Pinochet] In my opinion, it should think more than twice 
before convening the National Security Council. In the first 
place, it is questionable whether this case falls within the 
purview of the National Security Council. 
  [Bofill] But that is the legal mechanism the government has 
available to it to bring about the retirement of Stange or of 
the commanders in chief of the other branches. 
  [Pinochet] Yes, that is the legal mechanism. But it should 
think twice before using it, because it is an extreme measure. 
You go to the National Security Council after numerous events 
have taken place, and once you get there, that is the end of the 
line. Everything ends there. That is why I say it is an extreme 
measure. 
  [Bofill] For that same reason, would it not be a good idea 
to 
go right away to the National Security Council to bring the 
matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible? 
  [Pinochet] The problem lies in what I pointed out earlier: 
The situation should be studied very thoroughly, and everything 
should be considered several times before making a decision, 
because first it must be determined whether this is a matter for 
the Council to deal with. I will not tell you what my position 
is, but I do want to make it very clear that this problem must 
be analyzed through and through. 
  [Bofill] Supposing that the National Security Council is 
ultimately convened. How would you vote? 
  [Pinochet] That will be revealed at the time of the vote. 
  [Bofill] When there were problems between the Army and La 
Moneda in the previous administration, there were some very 
tense times, such as the liaison exercise and the so-called 
boinazo [display of force by the military in May 
1993]. Do you think similar situations could occur now between 
the Carabineros and the current administration? 
  [Pinochet] I cannot tell you anything about the current 
situation in the Carabineros. What I want to make very clear is 
that during the previous administration, the Army always 
respected the law that was in effect at the time. On the other 
hand, I think that the periods of good relations far outweigh 
those that you have mentioned, and in any case, they were 
resolved satisfactorily. 
  [Bofill] With regard to the human rights cases involving the 
Army, what problems do you see in the future? 
  [Pinochet] I do not see any problem in the future. The 
normal 
course of action is being taken. The majority of the cases have 
qualified for amnesty. What problem could there be? 
  [Bofill] The case of General Manuel Contreras, for example. 
  [Pinochet] And why will there be a problem in that case? He 
had his trial, the case is on appeal, and ultimately a final 
judgment will be forthcoming. I do not see any hindrance. The 
courts are handling pending human rights cases, and that is the 
branch of government that will make the final decision, and that 
decision, of course, will be respected. 
  [Bofill] Many people say you seem more serene than before, 
and they say it is due to.... 
  [Pinochet] (Laughing) Due to my age, no doubt. 
  [Bofill] Some may think that. But the majority say it is 
because you have good relations with the new government, 
especially with Minister Perez Yoma. 
  [Pinochet] There are several things going on there. I like 
to 
see military matters treated as military matters, without 
interference from people who want to insert issues that are of 
concern to people who know nothing about the military. Things 
must be viewed with professionalism. 
  [Bofill] Does that mean that former Minister Patricio Rojas 
knew nothing about the military? 
  [Pinochet] No, I am referring to people. What I am saying is 
that I see a difference in the approach. Now, issues are dealt 
with, they are discussed, and ideas and concepts are seen with 
precision. It is very clear what actions will be taken. I see 
that difference. For me, it is very important for issues to be 
dealt with properly. I have been in the military for 62 years, 
and I have held every job. I have a lot of experience, and that 
is very valuable for a commander in chief. 
  [Bofill] There has been a lot of talk about a number of 
signs 
that you are more in sync with this government. One of them is 
the fact that your wife recently attended a reception at La 
Moneda, where she had not set foot in four years. 
  [Pinochet] Our visit to La Moneda was a friendly gesture. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bofill] Getting back to the previous administration, did 
the 
contact you had during that period with Socialists such as 
former Minister Enrique Correa change your opinion of that 
political sector? 
  [Pinochet] I do not want to get into that, because it is a 
political matter. I will answer questions about the Army. I must 
be extremely prudent about this. 
  [Bofill] One of the most controversial issues involving the 
Army recently was the departure of General Jorge Ballerino.... 
  [Pinochet] That is a very simple problem. Gen. Ballerino was 
10,000 kilometers away, and he saw the situation from a 
different perspective. Gen. Lucar was able to remain one more 
year in the job of vice commander in chief, which blocked the 
way for Gen. Ballerino. So he had to remain in the post of 
inspector general of the Army, which is the same as the chief of 
staff or the commander of the First Corps, because they all come 
under me. But someone butted in and gave him bad advice, and, 
well, everyone knows how things turned out. 
  [Bofill] Who was it who butted in and gave him bad advice? 
  [Pinochet] Someone. [passage omitted] 
  [Bofill] You do acknowledge that you had problems with the 
United States. 
  [Pinochet] No one has behaved more badly toward us than the 
Americans did during our time in government. I will always 
remember that. Today I refuse to buy as much as a rifle from the 
United States, because tomorrow I may have a problem and they 
will not give me ammunition. [passage omitted] 
  [Bofill] One issue that is in the forefront throughout the 
world at this time is corruption. Can you say for certain that 
during the 17 years you were in power, not a single high-ranking 
official abused his office for some purpose? 
  [Pinochet] I never had any complaints about my officials, 
with very few exceptions. And when I did have a complaint, I had 
the official investigated. The officials in my government, first 
of all, earned less than they do now, and people worked more for 
the good of Chile than for their own good. I had very dedicated 
mayors, and I had officials who could have earned 20 times more 
working for a bank than for the government. 
  [Bofill] That is all very well, but human weaknesses do not 
recognize ideological or political borders. Why do you think the 
corruption issue is so hot now? 
  [Pinochet] Well, because people want to own more things. And 
television and advertising undoubtedly contribute to that. 
Everyone wants to have a nice car, a nice house, a nice swimming 
pool, they want to have a good time, go to a nice place and be 
served a good whisky. Those things do not tempt me. 
Unfortunately, I do not drink, not even copper [yo no tomo ni 
cobre]... 
  [Bofill] All of these temptations that you mention are 
seductive not only to civilians, but also to military men. To 
what extent are the low salaries in the Armed Forces a dangerous 
factor in the spread of corruption? 
  [Pinochet] Look, it might be dangerous, but we take steps to 
make sure our men are well off. They are able to go on very 
inexpensive vacations, something that other people have to spend 
much more on. They wear uniforms, so they do not have to spend 
money on civilian clothing if they do not want to...I will not 
tell you they are not asking for raises--they do ask. The cost 
of living has gone up a lot, more than the CPI. You used to be 
able to fill your cart, buy a whole week's groceries at the 
store for 1,000 pesos. Now that does not buy enough for two 
days, not even one. They are asking for raises to cover 
necessities, but this is not a problem that can affect us in the 
sense that your question implies. 
  [Bofill] One of the great contradictions that people mention 
about your government was that it never privatized Codelco. Why 
not? Do you think that if that had been done, scandals like the 
current one could have been avoided? 
  [Pinochet] I do not buy the notion that scandals happen only 
in state-run companies. Scandals happen with or without 
privatization. 
  [Bofill] But why did you not privatize Codelco as you did 
with so many other state-run companies? 
  [Pinochet] In the first place, because it was important for 
national defense. It was thought that we needed to have all the 
copper in our hands. Later on, however, I favored privatizing 
it. What happened was that internal factions formed in 
opposition to it, and even though it was a good idea, I could 
not do it. 
  [Bofill] You were in charge of this country. There were a 
lot 
of other things that people opposed, but you did them anyway.... 
  [Pinochet] Well, there are things and there are things. As I 
said, if it were just up to me, Codelco would be in private 
hands right now. Do not forget that I was not alone. A number of 
steps had to be followed to privatize a company, and that was 
the idea. In the northern section, the southern section. It did 
not just happen. You cannot do everything. 
  [Bofill] Former President Aylwin had a problem with the 
Codelco scandal that has affected you as well: seeing relatives 
involved in scandals. In your case, it was the matter of your 
eldest son's checks. How does that affect you? 
  [Pinochet] I think it is a great injustice, because people 
immediately connect it with the person who is at the top. In the 
case of my son's checks, it was concluded that he was telling 
the truth. People kept the issue alive because I was commander 
in chief. The goal was to attack the commander in chief. 
  [Bofill] Is that kind of problem more difficult to face than 
others? 
  [Pinochet] (Smiling slyly and touching his left hand with 
the 
tips of his right fingers) In time, you develop a thick skin. 
You learn how to confront these things. I have the hide of a 
crocodile. 
  [Bofill] Do you think former President Aylwin does, too? 
  [Pinochet] Do not get me involved in that. 
  [Bofill] Is it true you plan to travel to Russia? 
  [Pinochet] I will tell you a story. I was invited to Russia, 
before Yeltsin assumed power. The people who brought me the 
invitation were right there where you are sitting and in the 
chair across from you. But later they came back and asked me to 
please postpone the trip for a little while because everyone was 
in the KGB. There was a woman who controlled them with her 
glance. Then the Yeltsin problem arose, and I did not have 
anything more to do with them. Since then, I have not accepted 
any invitations. But of course I would like to visit Russia, a 
country with a long history, and I like history a lot. [passage

<F P=106> [Debate between presidential candidates Ernesto Samper of </F>
the Liberal Party and Andres Pastrana of the Conservative Party, 
moderated by reporters Yamid Amat, Maria Elvira Samper, and 
Maria Isabel Rueda, at the Inravision Television Network studios 
in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] [Amat] Dr. Pastrana, many times during your campaign 
you said, you reiterated this clearly in the speech you 
delivered to National Exporters Association, that your objective 
is to lower inflation to eight percent. One understands 
inflation cannot be reduced to eight percent without reducing 
salaries by eight percent. Thus, must salaried workers in 
Colombia expect an eight percent salary reduction from you? 
  [Pastrana] No. This is a matter of protecting the 
pocketbooks of Colombians. I am going to give you some 
information. More than half of the salary increases Colombians 
received in December have dissipated so far this year as a 
result of inflation. They no longer enjoy this raise. 
  That is why I have insisted the worst enemy of exporters and 
agriculture is revaluation. That is why we must also fight 
revaluations, to be able to eliminate inflation. What am I 
proposing? Let us seek a healthy fiscal discipline and control 
public spending. Did you know 50 percent of inflation comes 
from excess public spending? That is why we must establish 
healthy fiscal discipline and prioritize spending. 
  Second, what do we accomplish by reducing inflation? This 
will permit us to defend the pocketbooks of Colombians. I 
insist, in December, Colombians received a wage hike and already 
in January the cost of public services skyrocketed. That is why 
we are seeking efficiency in public services. We want to lower 
the rates collected for public services. I have also proposed 
to lower the costs of education. A large part of the basic 
market basket is also due to the high cost of education. We 
must defend the salary of Colombians and we are going to lower 
inflation to less than 10 percent before my term in office 
expires. This has already been done in Argentina. Bolivia did 
it; Peru managed to do it; and we will do it in Colombia to 
defend the pocketbooks of Colombians and maintain basic market 
prices at appropriate levels. 
  [Amat] Dr. Pastrana, with all due respect, one of the things 
for which you are criticized is that when one asks you a 
question, you respond to something different. I asked you 
specifically if workers can expect an eight percent adjustment 
in their salaries from you? 
  [Pastrana] No, no, no, no. Workers must expect an adjustment 
in relation to their salaries. Regarding the question you 
asked, it is inconceivable that when workers get 18- to 
20-percent wage hikes, in early January, the rates for public 
services increased 20 to 22 percent, gasoline increased by rates 
higher than the wage hike. What I am saying is the government 
cannot continue to play with workers in Colombia. In December, 
they get a wage hike and only three or four months later the 
increase is reduced to half. 
  [Amat] Thank you very much, Dr. Pastrana. Dr. Samper, your 
turn now. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Well, I think Colombians have been very 
much 
disappointed by Dr. Pastrana's response. I think he has only 
addressed generalities about inflation. What we have at stake 
here are two fundamental variables, namely inflation and 
unemployment. 
  With an eight percent inflation rate, we can think 
unemployment will go up 15 percent, meaning there will be an 
additional 500,000 people without jobs. I do not know what Dr. 
Pastrana will really do with those 500,000 additional unemployed 
persons, which under the current circumstances is what would 
result from an eight percent inflation rate. What I have been 
proposing is a new system to handle inflation. Everyone handles 
inflation from the demand side, that is, taking resources from 
the people's pockets. Let us not raise the price for coffee 
growers, let us not raise workers' wages, let us not increase 
pensions to pensioners, because that is inflationary. 
  What is inflation? Inflation is many pesos seeking a few 
products. What we must do then is to produce, to produce food, 
to produce new and cheaper services, and that way, and only that 
way, handle the topic of inflation demands. That is how we can 
really lower the people's cost of living without hurting their 
salaries and revenues. 
  [Amat] Dr. Samper, almost the same thing that happened with 
Dr. Pastrana happened now. What will your policy be on the 
workers' wages? 
  [Ernesto Samper] The policy is very simple, and the same 
thing did not happen. The policy is very simple. Salaries must 
go up at least to the same level as the inflation rate. I am 
not going to have the situation we have experienced these past 
few years in which salaries are climbing up the stairs and the 
cost of living, tuitions, and public services are going up on 
the elevator. 
  [Amat] You now have one minute to respond. 
  [Pastrana] I am glad Dr. Samper agrees with me. He is saying 
that while some things are going up, others are coming down. 
That is precisely it, the high costs of public service rates. 
Dr. Samper is contradicting himself, and it becomes clear on 
this topic. He says he is going to curb the inflation rate, 
stamp out revaluation, yet he is proposing white-elephant 
projects to the country, projects for 3 billion pesos or 4 
billion pesos like the Bogota subway. That is a project that 
will generate a revaluation. That is why my proposal is 
different. I am asking the country: Is Cali, Barranquilla, or 
the coast ready to pay.... 
  [Ernesto Samper, interrupting] I would like to know.... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] We should [words indistinct].... 
  [Ernesto Samper, interrupting] Dr. Pastrana is.... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] Let us prevent revaluation because 
[words indistinct].... 
  [Amat, interrupting] Dr. Pastrana, Dr. Samper, Dr. Samper, 
please. 
  [Ernesto Samper] I am asking him to let me speak, because he 
is talking very fast. 
  [Amat] Dr. Samper, please. [words indistinct] 
  [Ernesto Samper] So to be more prudent means [words 
indistinct] [Maria Samper and Rueda laugh] 
  [Amat] Dr. Samper, please. 
  [Ernesto Samper] First, I want Dr. Pastrana to tell the 
viewers that the Bogota subway project is a white elephant. 
Just eight days ago, he said it was necessary.... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] It is a white elephant within the 
concept that Dr. Samper is proposing conducting it through 
[words indistinct].... 
  [Rueda, interrupting] Please. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Talking faster will not make you win. 
  [Pastrana] I think the topic.... 
  [Ernesto Samper, interrupting] Take it easy. 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] That is why I am proposing granting 
contracts.... 
  [Ernesto Samper, interrupting] Take it easy. 
  [Pastrana] ...to private business. I think this is very 
important.... 
  [Ernesto Samper, interrupting] Do not include all the topics 
because you have 30 minutes. 
  [Rueda] Let us have some order. Let us have order, please. 
  [Amat] With all due respect, next is Maria Isabel Rueda. 
  [Rueda] Maria Elvira. 
  [Amat] Pardon me. Maria Elvira Samper asks the next 
question. 
  [Maria Samper] Dr. Samper, the economic model of the Gaviria 
government is neoliberal. We have seen that the views of the 
two candidates do not radically move away from this model. 
Still, we have seen a sort of switching of cables here. 
Whereas the opposition candidate, Andres Pastrana, seems to be 
a faithful follower of this economic model, you seem to be a 
revisionist of this model. How revisionist are you? 
  [Ernesto Samper] Maria Elvira, I participated in drafting 
the 
opening program. As development minister, I supported President 
Gaviria in the reduction of tariffs, giving flexibility to the 
labor market, and increasing private investment. I was involved 
in the process of opening. Right at that time, I mentioned some 
difficulties in implementing this model. I talk of gradual 
actions. Why? Because, I said, if we move the model too fast, 
we will find the agricultural sector will become depressed, as 
has happened. The same thing happened with the export sector. 
That is the gradual action consisted of, namely, giving 
conditions and possibilities to businessmen so they could adjust 
to the new model of competition. 
  What must we do as of now to prevent a return to the past? 
There are two very clear proposals: Dr. Pastrana's, which calls 
for an intensification and radicalization of openness, which is 
stated on page 19 of his government program; and mine, which is 
to complement openness, to initiate the social phase of openness 
by putting feelings into the process. In other words, we must 
promote social investments and development and create the 
conditions for more Colombians to feel that they are part of the 
openness process. That is my position. 
  [Maria Samper] Dr. Samper, will you pursue the privatization 
process? If you do, what institutions will be involved? Will 
Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise], for example, be 
among them? And can privatization be carried out in a manner 
such that state monopolies will be unable to become private 
monopolies and thus remain in the hands of the few? 
  [Ernesto Samper] I will not privatize Ecopetrol. I am 
definitely not going to privatize Ecopetrol and I am not going 
to turn privatization into a utopian goal. It is not taboo 
either. 
  I will not auction state institutions and be prey to what 
you 
pointed out: a transition from a public monopoly to a private 
monopoly. Should there be privatization processes they will be 
accompanied by democratization. I will not privatize anything 
that, socially speaking, should be the exclusive responsibility 
of the state, such as health and education. 
  [Maria Samper] Dr. Pastrana, it is almost unanimously agreed 
that openness has been reversed. While imports have increased 
50 percent, exports stand at scarcely 10 percent. How would you 
correct this model of reverse openness? 
  [Pastrana] I thought, Maria Elvira, that you would ask me 
the 
same question -- if I would pursue privatization -- which I 
believe is an important one. I will give you the facts. In 
February (?1990) Dr. Samper said: I will not pursue openness. 
This is why, Ernesto, I believe that each of us should talk 
instead of interpret each another. I do not want your 
contradictory policy. My economic program has a human face; it 
calls for investments in the social field. This is what I am 
proposing. 
  First, we must start off with the basic premise that for the 
country to progress we need peace. We must resolve such problems 
as public order and citizen security, invest in our people, 
potable water and infrastructure; we must construct new streets, 
recover the countryside, and once again make farming a good 
business. That is the aim of my government program and that is 
why the entire government program I am proposing to the 
Colombian people establishes the people's time has come and 
those are the areas in which we must invest. 
  In education, we will guarantee the education of all 
Colombian youths between ages five and 15. We must also 
guarantee that if a Colombian is admitted to a university but 
lacks resources, he will be granted a loan on his word. These 
loans will allow us to design a new country by educating our 
people. 
  We must invest in water for 11 million Colombians who do not 
have potable water and we must also generate an entire social 
investment policy like the one I have been calling for in my 
government program. How are we going to.... 
  [Maria Samper, interrupting] Dr. Pastrana, excuse me, but 
you 
have not answered my question. How will you change that model 
of reverse openness? 
  [Pastrana] I will tell you. The model was created precisely 
so the country could export and generate jobs; not so that it 
could import. Thus, I believe that first we should generate 
infrastructure. Colombian exporters pay between 12 and 14 
percent in contract fees. Why? Because we do not have 
highways. I propose to construct 5,000 km of highways in four 
years. Because we do not have efficient ports, because we do 
not have communications, because the countryside is undergoing a 
crisis and has been neglected. We must recover the countryside 
and we must create a viable economic model. 
  [Maria Samper] Dr. Samper, you have the floor to refute Dr. 
Pastrana. 
  [Ernesto Samper] I am even more confused with this answer 
than with the previous one.... 
  [Amat, interrupting] (?Would you like to sit down), Antonio? 
We must interrupt the program for a moment. Let us take a 
commercial break. 
  [Maria Samper] We apologize to our viewers for what just 
happened. Dr. Antonio Navarro, presidential candidate for the 
19 April Movement Democratic Alliance, unexpectedly and 
surprisingly interrupted the debate. Speaking for myself and my 
colleagues, I would like to say that we feel that we have been 
totally insulted. In our opinion, this incident constitutes an 
attack on freedom of the press. Two television newscasts, 
exercising their right to freedom of the press, jointly decided 
to hold a debate with the two candidates who, in our opinion -- 
not in our opinion but according to the polls -- are virtually 
the leading presidential options. I hereby protest on behalf of 
the reporters. I also believe this incident shows a lack of 
respect for the two candidates who, exercising their freedom of 
expression, kindly accepted our invitation. Having apologized, 
we would like to cordially continue the debate. 
  [Rueda] Dr. 
Samper was speaking when we were interrupted. Perhaps he could 
continue? 
  [Ernesto Samper] All right, I was establishing what, in my 
opinion, are the two outlooks on the opening issue being 
presented to the country at this time. On one side, I believe, 
there are several sectors interested in increasing the opening 
process. I consider this not to be the correct way. We need to 
stop our course. We need to make social investments. The 
opening cannot turn into a game of winners and losers, with the 
state picking up and curing those injured by the ravages of the 
opening. That is why I have proposed a plan -- to which I am 
committed and which I definitely do not think is incompatible 
with what has been implemented up to now -- to legitimize the 
opening process with social investment and especially with 
productive employment. This has been the main proposal of my 
campaign. We have to understand that 46 percent of the 
Colombians are in a situation of critical poverty and that any 
social, educational, or health measure will be seen simply as a 
remedial assistance solution. Productive employment is what 
will allow the country to truly achieve a social development 
that will afford people the possibility to, with their own 
efforts, procure and generate their own well-being. In my 
government, social policy will not be the younger sister of 
economic policy. Mainly, this policy will allow us to advance 
socially without sacrificing our growth goals. This is how I 
see it and I have moved to advance to the second phase of the 
opening process. 
  [Rueda] Dr. Pastrana, do you have anything to add? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, the important thing.... [pauses] I disagree 
with Dr. Samper, of course, because I believe the important 
thing is for the country to start doing well. Nevertheless, 
what good does it do for the country to do well if its people 
are not doing well? That is why we have to find ways for the 
country to grow, but together with the people. How are we going 
to get it to grow with the people? By investing, as I propose, 
in education, potable water, infrastructure, lowering costs for 
exporters so they can compete in international markets, make 
roads for farmers so they can sell their products not only in 
the national markets but in the international sphere too. We 
have to establish all the mechanisms that will allow us to have 
infrastructure, efficiency in our ports, communications. We 
have to conduct an opening process that truly works and not only 
-- as Maria Elvira has said -- for the country to import. No, 
we have to find a way for the model to work for exports and to 
generate jobs, as I am proposing to Colombians. 
  [Rueda] Dr. Pastrana, you have mentioned investments. In 
this administration -- I believe President Gaviria himself 
acknowledges this -- social investment has been applied to the 
fields of justice and security. For the viewers who are not 
experts in economics to understand, this means it took money 
away from the poor to give it to security and justice, which 
were national priorities. How will this situation be broached 
in your government? 
  [Pastrana] I propose that we maintain, I believe we must 
sustain our investment in justice in Colombia because we cannot 
have impunity and we must have a Prosecutor's Office that works. 
We have to invest resources in this sector. We have to invest 
resources in our Armed Forces so that our soldiers can acquire 
professionalism to the benefit of Colombia. We have to invest, 
however -- this is my proposal -- between 10 and 12 percent of 
the GNP in the social sphere and by the end of my government we 
will have done this. We will invest in all the programs I have 
mentioned already. 
  [Rueda] That is, when you are president, if you get to be 
president, you will give more money than is given today.... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] To social investment, to the 
people. 
We are going to invest in the people. 
  [Rueda] You are going to decrease the amounts given to the 
Army and to justice? 
  [Pastrana] No, we have to maintain those investments. The 
Army receives approximately 2.5 or 2.8 percent and I believe we 
have to maintain this. We have to professionalize the Army.... 
  [Rueda, interrupting] This means you will not give them more 
money? 
  [Pastrana] We have to professionalize the Army. I propose 
that we end mandatory conscription and that we gradually 
decrease the size of the Army. President Gaviria has already 
talked about 10,000 new professional soldiers and I believe we 
must gradually.... 
  [Rueda, interrupting] Professional soldiers cost more money, 
however? 
  [Pastrana] ...gradually we will increase it. We will be able 
to do so if we give priority to expenses as I have proposed. 
This means that investments must be made on a priority basis 
and the social sector is our priority. 
  [Rueda] Dr. Samper, please, the same question for you. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Let us see. First, I am glad that Dr. 
Pastrana is looking into the obligatory military service idea. 
On 15 September 1992, he voted in the Senate in favor of the 
draft. Second, I fully agree with Maria Isabel that to speak of 
professionalizing the Army and simultaneously speak of reduced 
Armed Forces expenses is a contradiction. A professional 
soldier costs 3.5 times what a conscripted soldier costs. 
Third, what are we going to do? We will effectively increase 
social investments, not to 12 percent, but to 15 percent. This 
means increasing what is defined as social investment -- 
housing, education, and health -- from $4.2 billion to $10 
billion in 1998, thus covering 15 percent of the GNP. Chile did 
it, Mexico did it, and we also can do it if we rationalize 
expenses, if we increase the efficiency of social expenditures, 
and if we make allowances while we gradually attain peace -- I 
am going to attain peace -- to accommodate different expenses 
to replace security and defense expenditures. 
  [Maria Samper] I have two questions for both of you. Both of 
you speak beautifully of social investments, but the question is 
obvious: Where will the money come from? Dr. Pastrana, 
regarding taxes, will you raise them? Will you lower them? 
  [Pastrana] First, I want to reply to Dr. Samper that I voted 
for the military service because the choice was either to end it 
or keep it. As with everyone else in the Congress, I voted that 
to maintain the military service. What we need to do is end it 
gradually. Second: Peace is the country's top priority. We 
must find mechanisms to consolidate peace and end impunity in 
Colombia. We do not believe in impunity. The last planning 
study indicates that 97 percent of the cases go unpunished. We 
need to investigate there. 
  [Maria Samper] But Dr. Pastrana, excuse me, please reply to 
my question about taxes. I want your pledge to the country. 
Briefly, give me your tax policy. 
  [Pastrana] Regarding tax policies, I have proposed reducing 
the income tax from 37.5 percent to 30 percent. Dr. Samper 
voted for this when he was senator in 1986, and I feel that was 
very important -- to drop the rate from 40 percent to 30 
percent. We do not uphold the notion that because we lower 
taxes we will not collect more. Dr. Samper knows as well as I do 
the economic theory that by lowering taxes there could well be 
greater revenues. How? Because we will control tax evasion, we 
will attract investments, this will generate more jobs, we will 
also democratize and broaden the tax base, and I believe we have 
to match the 1986 reforms -- dropping the rate from 37.5 percent 
to 30 percent. By controlling expenses we will be able to 
invest in social areas, as I propose. 
  [Maria Samper] Dr. Samper. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Well, to say one is going to reduce taxes 
from 37.5 percent to 30 percent is to promise something that has 
already been agreed. In 1997, the war surcharge will have to be 
reduced anyway. It was established by law and by law it has to 
be removed. The problem is whether we will remove it and how 
will we do it. To my way of thinking, the best way to finance 
social development is to use part of the Cusiana resources. We 
can also sign up for a multilateral credit package, the type the 
World Bank is currently offering -- fortunately the World Bank 
is beginning to reform its policies -- and also use 
Inter-American Development Bank funds, which are currently aimed 
at health and education. These are called basic social packages. 
The funds exist to finance a broad and ambitious social 
development proposal. I have studied and located where these 
funds will come from. As part of the government macroeconomic 
program we have planned, the possibility and capacity to 
generate resources for social investment exists. 
  [Amat] Please reply yes or no. Do you believe Andres 
Pastrana has the capacity to handle this country? 
  [Ernesto Samper] Excuse me Yamid, but the question is 
offensive. I have a good personal impression of Dr. Pastrana 
and if I reply no it will be interpreted as an offense and if I 
say yes.... 
  [Amat, interrupting] Do you, Dr. Pastrana, believe him 
capable? 
  [Pastrana] I do believe Dr. Samper is capable. 
  I believe that my political experience as an alderman, as a 
businessman in the private sector, as mayor of the city, as a 
senator, and now as a presidential candidate has been 
acknowledged. That is my experience. My curriculum vitae is 
open. I can tell Colombians that in all the posts I have 
occupied, I have demonstrated that I do what I say I will do. 
This is my commitment as president of Colombia. I am making a 
commitment to the Colombian people: social investment, an 
improved standard of living, promoting Colombia abroad, and the 
search for peace. Those are my commitments, and I am directing 
my efforts toward those objectives. 
  [Amat] Dr. Samper, you have not been accused of being inept 
but of being inconsistent. You say one thing one day, and 
something else the next. 
  [Ernesto Samper] These are common objections in politics, 
especially from people who do not agree with one's position and 
would like to see one shift to their side. My curriculum vitae 
is also open. Throughout my political career I have maintained a 
course toward social work. The other day I was thinking about 
the bills I promoted in Congress. I promoted the urban reforms 
bill, the low-cost housing project, and the accounting and 
cooperative bill. 
  I worked in the Economic Development Ministry and always 
oriented myself along social development lines. Even when I was 
ambassador to Spain, I dedicated myself to helping Colombians 
abroad. Colombians have a difficult time abroad. Imagine how it 
would be if they did not have the support of their embassies or 
consulates. 
  I am prepared to engage in any debate on inconsistency, but 
let us not have abstract charges like someone telling me that I 
am inconsistent and leaving it at that. I want to be told why I 
am inconsistent. Then I can work on that. 
  [Amat] Gentlemen, the debate is now in your hands to express 
any criticism you may have about the other's personality. 
  [Pastrana] I have a record that I can show the country. 
  [Amat] Pardon me, I am talking about criticizing the other. 
  [Pastrana] Right. That is why I want to say that I have 
maintained a clear, consistent policy. I have a record and the 
people know it. I want to defend my record because I have heard 
Dr. Samper's criticism and I think it is right to evaluate his 
work in the ministry. 
  When Dr. Samper was a minister, the industrial sector grew 
only 0.3 percent. When the ministers of the New Democratic 
Force were in charge -- Dr. Ospina and Dr. Moreno -- the sector 
grew more than 4.5 percent. The same happened in the 
construction sector. Under Dr. Samper, construction growth 
dropped to 0.7 percent, but under ministers like Moreno and 
Ospina, it grew by more than 10 percent. If we look at the trade 
sector, the same thing happened. Under Dr. Samper, trade grew 
by 1.6 percent, but under ministers Moreno, Ospina, and others 
of the New Force, the levels were above the 4 percent mark. 
  This is my record: The people of Bogota know that my work 
was excellent, that we worked for the city. That is the record 
I have to show Colombians. 
  [Ernesto Samper] I paved the way for Dr. Pastrana's 
ministers 
at the Economic Development Ministry. Unfortunately, I do not 
know if they wasted what I left them. I was put in charge of 
one ministry and I left two other ministries, including the 
Foreign Trade Ministry. The industrial sector was happy with my 
work. I defended the industrial sector during this first phase 
of the opening. 
  Dr. Pastrana's tenure as mayor is a different matter. I do 
not deny that he did positive things. I was alderman at the 
time, so I know a lot about his term. Insecurity grew because 
he practically finished the CAI's [Immediate Attention Centers]. 
City district finances were practically destroyed. 
  [Pastrana] We have to tell Dr. Samper that Bogota's index of 
crime-related deaths dropped from 47,000 to 44,000 deaths in 
1989. [bell begins to ring] The most important thing is... 
  [Ernesto Samper] The bell is ringing, Doctor. 
  [Pastrana] Most importantly, Dr. Samper does not even 
remember that those were the years of narcoterrorism, so the 
city was given more protection. [Everyone speaks at once] 
  [Pastrana] The death toll dropped from 47,000 to 44,000. The 
CAI's, how were they created? Does Dr. Samper even know? 
  [Rueda] Do you know, Dr.? 
  [Ernesto Samper] Okay, Dr., before you tell us, I will tell 
you the truth in a few words. 
  [Pastrana] The CAI's are the result of a policy and an 
experiment presented to Dr. Julio Cesar Sanchez. 
  [Ernesto Samper] I will tell you the truth in a few words. 
Had there not been... 
  [Rueda, interrupting] But, but.. 
  [Pastrana] If only Dr. Samper will let me speak, I will let 
him speak. That is why....[pauses] Why don't you put a 
30-second rule on both of us? 
  [Amat] We will respectfully go to commercials. 
  [Rueda] We will be right back. 
  [Maria Samper] I believe there is one very important issue 
for the nation: our relations with the United States. They are 
at their worst level in many years because of recent differences 
with the Colombian Prosecutor General's Office, specifically on 
its struggle against drug trafficking, among other things. Mr. 
Samper, how do you plan to reverse or fix this problem? 
  [Ernesto Samper] I would say that Colombia's relations with 
the United States have two angles: First, the trade angle. 
True, we are currently enjoying some advantage thanks to 
(?ADFA) [expansion unknown] -- very important tariff reductions 
that we must continue to take advantage of. At last it was 
understood that we were not the henchmen, but the main victims 
of drug trafficking. Second, we have the judicial cooperation 
relations. I hope to convince the U.S. Government that [timer 
rings] judicial cooperation; I hope to convince the U.S. 
Government that regardless of any review of the penal code 
dealing with drug trafficking crimes -- term reduction systems 
should not be cumulative, which is another point that has the 
U.S. Government uneasy -- we can then fully reestablish our 
relations. I want to emphatically state that on no account 
would I be willing to hand over the prosecutor general's head on 
a platter to solve these problems. These problems must be 
resolved through diplomatic channels and with the harmony and 
understanding Colombia and the United States have experienced 
during the past 20 years. 
  [Maria Samper] The same question for you, Mr. Pastrana. 
  [Pastrana] I believe relations between Colombia and the 
United States cannot be reduced to Senator Kerry and the 
prosecutor general. I believe our relations should go far 
beyond that. We must therefore seek to strengthen our relations. 
  The idea is to bring drug traffickers to trial in Colombia. 
If Colombia is able to send evidence to allow the United States 
to take drug traffickers to trial, we can then send our evidence 
too. Therefore, we must strengthen the exchange between the two 
governments and this is the policy we must uphold. Drug 
trafficking policies not only belong to Colombia. If the United 
States does not take measures against drug demand, then drugs 
will continue to be shipped, possibly from countries other than 
Colombia. That is why it is important to strengthen the 
judicial exchange process between the two countries so as to 
condemn those who commit the crime. 
  Second, we need to strengthen economic relations between the 
United States and Colombia. We must make good use of Colombia's 
current advantage, which we will project by requesting entry 
into NAFTA. This is where our efforts should be directed -- to 
ensure the country grows, that we can export, that we can gain 
from foreign investment, that we can attract industries, 
generate new jobs, and make good use of these advantages that 
grant us today the possibility of joining NAFTA and allow 
Colombia the prerogative to seek employment and well-being for 
the people of Colombia. 
  [Maria Samper] The ring is yours, gentlemen. 
  [Ernesto Samper] You will forgive me, Mr. Pastrana, but that 
coincides with what my proposal offers, and I cannot exactly 
rebut my own proposals, can I? Perhaps he has something to say 
about my idea on this. 
  [Pastrana] I do. What exactly has been happening lately? I 
was the one who presented the submitting to justice policy being 
used in Colombia for the first time in 1990. I asked myself 
then: Why do we not copy a system similar to the U.S. policy?. 
This is why, during the mayoral summit held in the United 
States... 
  [Amat, interrupting] Excuse me, but with all due respect, I 
must interrupt. 
  [Pastrana] Just a minute. 
  [Amat] The one to propose the policy of submitting to 
justice 
in Colombia was former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen in 1972. 
  [Pastrana] I presented a formal proposal to the mayors. I 
believe this is important. I presented it to the mayors and, if 
I remember correctly, I was criticized by the U.S. media. They 
asked why we should accept this system? I told them that the 
system was theirs, not ours. I believe the policy should be 
directed at getting information from the lower levels that can 
allow us to catch the big fish, that lead us to the real 
criminals. That is where the submitting to justice policy 
should be aimed. The changes we are proposing for the Penal 
Code should not be to increase penalties. No. We must develop 
the instruments to capture these criminals... [timer rings] and 
bring them to trial. 
  [Ernesto Samper] The drug trafficking issue is far more 
complex than that. There are four stages of drug trafficking: 
production of coca, stage two is the issue of trafficking in 
itself, consumption, and money laundering. I would propose a 
binational commission to seek solutions to each of these four 
stages, which are totally different in conception and solution. 
  [Rueda] Mr. Samper, let us move on to another issue, which 
we could call brother to this one: public security in Colombia. 
You have said, or I have heard that you have said, you will not 
negotiate with terrorists, kidnappers, those who plant land 
mines, or those who blow up oil pipelines. The Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia and the Army of National Liberation do 
these things. With whom will you talk? With whom will you 
negotiate? Or are you going to negotiate at all? 
  [Ernesto Samper] My, please do not be so definitive, Maria 
Isabel. I proposed that Colombia sign the Geneva Convention's 
Protocol II, which deals with the humanization of the war. Why? 
Because the first requirement for negotiating is creating a 
human rights system to protect civilians. It is as reproachable 
for a government soldier or a policeman, no matter where he or 
she may be, to violate the human rights of the people as it is 
for the guerrillas to do so. To this end, we must set up this 
framework. One cannot call blowing a small child's legs off an 
act of war, neither is kidnapping someone. If we sign Protocol 
II, we will be in a position to establish the difference a 
between a criminal and the subject of political negotiation. 
This is why my basic proposal calls for us to establish the 
difference between acts of war and those that harm the civilian 
population. 
  [Rueda] Mr. Pastrana, I ask you the same question, but 
with an additional note. I studied your government program as 
closely as I could, and I found on page 145 that you tend more 
toward a forceful solution, as I understand it, when you address 
the issue of guerrillas. You mention dialogue very 
superficially. What is your position on this? 
  [Pastrana] I think that the program must be read. I will 
tell you clearly what the program's proposal is: The government 
does not choose beetween war and peace, the government has to 
defend the Constitution and the laws. It is the guerrillas who 
must make a choice and decide for peace. Why don't the 
guerrillas tell the country what they want? The country does 
not know what the guerrillas want. Whenever I travel throughout 
the country, the people tell me that the guerrillas want power, 
or kidnappings, or to be paid tolls. 
  I am proposing that we have neither a high commissioner nor 
a 
medium commissioner. No more dialogues for the sake of 
dialogues. If the guerrillas tell us what they want, then I, as 
president of Colombia, am prepared to sit at the negotiating 
table and to talk with them. Once the guerrillas tell us what 
they want, I am prepared to invite international overseers, the 
international community, to come. Then we would have observers 
like the Catholic Church. I am sure that in this way we will 
have peace. 
  If the guerrillas do not tell us what they want, then we 
just 
have to continue implementing the Constitution and the laws 
which state that we have to protect the lives, the honor, and 
the property of Colombians. I am sure that the guerrillas will 
tell us what they want. I am sure that when I become president 
of Colombia we will sign peace agreements with them, along as 
they tell us that this is what they want. 
  [Maria Samper] Your turn, Dr. Samper. 
  [Ernesto Samper] With all due respect, I believe that plan 
is 
overly simplistic. I, as the president, will not wait until the 
guerrillas set the conditions and limits for a dialogue. I will 
take on the peace process myself. That peace process assumes the 
creation of conditions of understanding and the existence of 
respect for human rights, and social investment to counter 
violent elements. I do not agree with waiting for the 
guerrillas to set the conditions and parameters for 
negotiations, and to set the rules of the game vis-a-vis the 
state. 
  [Pastrana] I disagree completely. I believe Colombians are 
sick and tired of holding a dialogue just for the sake of it. 
We cannot go on with high or medium commissioners. I do not 
know if Dr. Samper wants to retain the plan recommended by his 
advisors and Horacio Serpa -- to retain a high commissioner. I 
believe Colombians want to know what the guerrillas are after. 
I am positive that as soon as the guerrillas tell us that... 
  [Maria Samper, interrupting] But is that not dialogue? 
  [Pastrana, continuing] ...they are willing to negotiate 
peace, we will negotiate peace. We will sit at the negotiating 
table whenever they tell us what they want to do, when they 
express their willingness to end kidnappings and threats. I am 
confident we will be able to negotiate peace whenever they tell 
us what they want. 
  [Maria Samper] Dr. Pastrana, you want to hear the guerrillas 
out, but is that not dialogue? 
  [Pastrana] We want the guerrillas to tell us what they want. 
This is different from sitting down at the negotiating table. 
We want the guerrillas to tell us... 
  [Amat, interrupting] Do you want them to send you a letter? 
  [Pastrana, continuing] ...that is why Colombians and I are 
willing, provided the guerrillas tell us what they want, to sit 
down with them, as president of Colombia, and work together to 
achieve peace. I am willing to invite international overseers, 
international representatives, and the Catholic Church, and I am 
sure we will be able to negotiate peace. 
  [Ernesto Samper] I will not wait until the guerrillas tell 
me 
what they want. I will tell the guerrillas: Here is the 
government with the Armed Forces willing to fight a war, and 
here is a government that is truly willing to make peace. It is 
your choice. 
  [Amat] I am still not very clear on your positions. Will you 
or will you not talk with the guerrillas? 
  [Ernesto Samper] I will talk with the guerrillas insofar as 
I 
know it will be useful. I will not make the old mistake of 
sitting at a negotiating table for two years to end up 
empty-handed. 
  [Amat] Very well. The two leading themes in this electoral 
campaign have been unemployment and education. Unemployment in 
Colombia occurs mainly among high school graduates and 
professionals. Is not it contradictory to offer education and 
jobs when those in the unemployment lines are those who are in 
fact educated? 
  [Pastrana] My government plan is entirely based on 
employment 
-- 270 pages in which I address the nation on the need to make 
our economy more dynamic. Where am I trying to create jobs? We 
create jobs through building roads and highways, building 
aqueducts, developing the tourism industry, and developing 
health care. First, if we develop health care in Colombia, 
doctors will have jobs. If we build roads, engineers will have 
work, instead of driving cabs. Second, education is the 
foundation. I recall talking to the Singapore prime minister, 
who told me he was very thankful that God did not give them any 
natural resources because that had enabled them to focus on 
their human resources. Thus, I believe a country must invest in 
its people. 
  Forgive me for correcting you, Yamid, but the highest 
unemployment rate is among women and young people. This is why 
we have to create new opportunities, provide the people with an 
education. We are going to give all young people from ages five 
to 15 the opportunity to obtain a primary and a secondary school 
education. We are going to give credits to professionals who 
want to study and are unable to attend university classes 
because the better educated the people are, the better their 
salaries will be. I ask parents who are watching me right now: 
What is the best legacy we can leave to our children? I am sure 
that the answer is education. It is in this direction that we 
must head. This is our best resource: our people. We may have 
natural resources, but the most important resource is our people. 
  [Amat] Thank you. Dr. Samper. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Let us see: Do you know how many pages Dr. 
Pastrana dedicates to employment in his program? Two and 
one-quarter pages! He dedicates 0.72 percent of his program to 
employment. Everything can relate to employment, of course, but 
he does not view microenterprises, the recovery of the 
countryside, infrastructure, and social investment programs that 
I am proposing as job-generating programs. Why? Behind Dr. 
Pastrana's program there is this posture position that I 
respectfully do not share. It is the old development posture of 
the 1970's that was propounded a few years ago by the very 
illustrious Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, currently a partner of Dr. 
Pastrana. The position is: Let us watch the economy grow and 
generate jobs and just see what we can do. 
  Employment versus eduction. I do not know what will go 
through the minds of high school graduates who sell lottery 
tickets or through the minds of professionals who are driving 
taxis if we tell them: Look, you are qualified unemployed people 
-- the unemployment rate of professional workers is twice as 
high as that of unskilled workers -- just wait some 10 years 
until we educate everyone and then you will have the opportunity 
to get a job. This is not the way! The road is to resolve -- 
as I am going to do -- the unemployment problem right now. This 
does not mean we are not going to develop education. But right 
now the unemployment lists are full of qualified workers. 
  [Amat] Each has 30 seconds. 
  [Pastrana] I disagree with Dr. Samper. I think that what we 
have to do is to create opportunities for the people. If we 
build roads, engineers will be able to work. If we invest in 
health care, creating opportunities for all Colombians, doctors 
will have jobs. We have to create new opportunities. This is 
what we are proposing to the country -- opportunities in the 
form of roads... 
  [Amat, interrupting] [Words indistinct] 
  [Pastrana] Please let me speak, Yamid. Opportunities in the 
form of roads. The television clock says I still have seven 
seconds, and you have been interrupting me. I still have 10 
seconds. I say this respectfully. 
  [Amat] Please go ahead. 
  [Pastrana] We are investing in roads, education, potable 
water. This is the government program. The problem is that Dr. 
Samper has just read 0.2 percent of my program. I am going to 
give Dr. Samper a copy. You may take it home and read it and 
you will see that the entire program is a search for jobs for 
all Colombians. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Dr. Pastrana's disagreement does not bother 
me. To the contrary, if he did not disagree I would be worried. 
The truth is that he has stepped down from his program to climb 
onto mine. This does not bother me either. This is what he has 
been doing for the past six or seven months. What I find 
difficult is the idea of having to shoulder the two programs, 
but I am prepared to do it. Employment must be productive and it 
must be created, induced, and generated by the state. This 
cannot be an automatic process. 
  [Amat] Dr. Samper, I am sorry I have to interrupt you. 
  [Rueda] I am going to ask you a very simple little 
question. What one thing does your adversary have that you 
covet? In one word. 
  [Ernesto Samper] Certain charm that the country recognizes. 
Also that he has an excellent opponent in the upcoming 
elections. 
  [Rueda] What about you, Dr. Pastrana? 
  [Pastrana] I would begin by saying that Dr. Samper 
acknowledges the fact that he has a capable man like me, more 
capable than he, to govern Colombia. I covet his advisers, like 
Rodrigo Oparto and Marta Lucia Ramirez. I envy you that, Dr. 
Samper. Those are intelligent people who will have to work with 
us in the government. 
  [Rueda] One last question because we are running out of 
time. 
In this government, we have experienced a polemical situation 
centered on the presidential family. How does a president 
manage the presidential family? Presidents have brothers. 
There is a brother of Dr. Pastrana who is with him all the 
time. Dr. Samper has three brothers who work... 
  [Ernesto Samper, interrupting] Usually against me. [laughs] 
  [Rueda, laughing] My question is: Do you have any policy on 
how to handle your families while in the government? Dr. Samper? 
  [Ernesto Samper] Yes. My policy is contained in a code of 
ethics that says that relatives of a president, and of a 
candidate, as of today, cannot have any kind of direct or 
indirect commercial ties with the state. As simple as that. 
  [Pastrana] As I see it, ethics need no code. No member of my 
family will work in the government. None. I say this now. As 
I see it, we have our own ethics, and they can have no code. 
Rest assured that no member of my family will work in the 
government. 
  [Amat] Will you agree to another debate? 
  [Pastrana] Of course, anytime. 
  [Samper] Another one?! [Much laughter] 
  [Amat] Let us go to commercials. We will be back. 
  These are the final two minutes. Dr. Andres Pastrana: Why 
do you think Colombians should vote for you? 
  [Pastrana] First, my vice president will be Luis Fernando 
Ramirez, who has the ability to help me govern Colombia. 
Second, I propose new opportunities for the country. The 
country has a very important resource, its people. We have to 
invest in education and create new opportunities so that they 
may have good jobs and we may start changing Colombia. 
  I am not the candidate of political machinery. We are 
thinking about a new future, about new opportunities. I am glad 
to have my family -- Nora, Santiago, Laura. The family 
represents values we need to recover in Colombia so that we, 
with trust in God and in His objectives, may recover our values 
and our families as the core of our society. We have a 
government program that has a main objective: promoting the 
people, an improved standard of living for our people, an 
economic program with a human face, as I call it. I am sure 
this can be done with the help of all the Colombians. I am not 
going to ask you just to vote for me on 29 May, I am going to 
invite all of you to work for the good of Colombia. 
  [Amat] The end of the program has been [word indistinct]. 
Dr. 
Samper, why do you think Colombians should vote for you? 
  [Ernesto Samper] I thank Yamid, Maria Elvira, and Maria 
Isabel for the debate. This has been the true debate. This was 
not a contrived debate but a debate on essence, on theses. 
  I hope Colombians have been able to establish that there are 
two clear alternatives for 29 May. Mine is that of 
socially-oriented capitalism, which will give subsidies back to 
farmers and will provide jobs for the young, that will decidedly 
invest in society. 
  I invite all of you to participate actively. Once I was the 
victim of violence like many other Colombians. Thank God, I won 
a second chance at life, and I want to use this second 
opportunity God has given me to help many Colombians have at 
least one opportunity to succeed. Thank you very much. 
  [Amat] Thanks to Daniel Coronel and to journalists from the 
two news teams. Maria Isabel has something to say. 
  [Rueda] Maria Elvira and I just want to thank the two 
candidates.

  [Text] Caracas, 14 May (EFE) -- Venezuela will not support 
a military intervention in Haiti, a Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said today in Caracas. The government, however, supports 
pressure tactics to restore democracy in that Caribbean nation. 
  According to the spokesman, Venezuela will not join any 
armed 
multinational force or support a unilateral decision by the 
United States if that country decides to intervene in Haiti. 
  Venezuela is the only Latin American country that belongs to 
the Group of Friends of Haiti, which comprises the United 
States, France, and Canada. 
  The possibility of an armed intervention in Haiti has gained 
strength after the military who toppled head of state 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide appointed a puppet president. This week 
the military, led by Raoul Cedras, who headed the coup, 
appointed Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint president, 
something the United Nations and the OAS have rejected. The 
United Nations agreed to tighten the economic sanctions on the 
Haitian military regime as of 21 May.

  [Text] San Jose, 15 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Security 
Minister Juan Diego Castro reported that the Costa Rican 
Government has asked Nicaragua for "explanations" on the capture 
of two motor boats carrying tourists by a Sandinist People's 
Army (EPS) patrol on Saturday in Costa Rican Caribbean 
territorial waters. 
  The two boats captured off the Barra del Colorado coast, 240 
km northeast of San Jose, had a Costa Rican crew and were 
carrying foreign tourists engaged in deep-sea fishing, when they 
were intercepted and towed to the port of Bluefields, in 
Nicaragua, the minister said. 
  Castro said the Costa Rican Government asked the Nicaraguan 
Government for "explanations" and the "immediate return of the 
boats and their crew." The Costa Rican Government also sent the 
Nicaraguan Government a report drafted by witnesses who observed 
the EPS maneuvers from a small airplane. 
  The boats were towed to Bluefilelds in Nicaragua, "and so 
far, we have not received any news on the whereabouts of the 
tourists or the boats' crews," Castro said today. 
  The minister added that the EPS soldiers went about 1,500 
meters inside the high-seas territorial waters, where they 
stayed for approximately two hours inspecting identity documents 
of several boats anchored off the Barra del Colorado coast. 
  The boat "Bull Shark" was piloted by Costa Rican citizens 
Luis Torres and Wallace Bryan and their passengers were 
identified as Erick Beacker, Brian Broheart, and Jean Carl 
Becquer. 
  The other captured boat is the "Guapote," which was piloted 
by Captain Roberto Brown. It was carrying foreign tourists who 
were identified by the police as Frank Vanbenbourgh and Ted 
Mosinut. The authorities did not reveal their nationalities.

  [Text] La Paz, 8 May (JATHA) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar today stated that the signing of an extradition 
treaty with the United States is on the government's agenda. He 
noted that the government is determined to sign it if it will 
benefit the country. 
  Aranibar said that the government would, in any case, sign 
the treaty "safeguarding the principle of respect for national 
sovereignty." 
  The issue has resurfaced at a time when the Bolivian Supreme 
Court is studying a U.S. petition for the extradition of Colonel 
Faustino Rico Toro, a former drug enforcement official who is 
facing charges in a Florida state court. 
  Aranibar said: "An extradition treaty is on the agenda, and 
the Bolivian Government is now willing to discuss it, to 
negotiate it, and -- if appropriate -- to sign the respective 
treaty." 
  Aranibar added: "This is how things currently stand, and 
this is the approach with which the Bolivian Government is going 
to work. We are determined to look into the prospects for modern 
international legal cooperation, taking into account the 
country's interests and the principles of international law." 
  Since the extradition of Asunta "Chunty" Roca Surez in July 
1982, the Supreme Court has turned down similar U.S. extradition 
requests, arguing that there are contradictions between Bolivian 
laws and the Vienna convention on drug enforcement and 
extradition. 
  The Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy have time and 
again stated that the new extradition treaty -- unlike the one 
currently in force, which dates back to 1900 -- will be 
specifically focused on the crime of drug trafficking.

  [Text] After it was confirmed that Belizean troops had 
entered Guatemalan territory, yesterday, Army spokesperson Major 
Edith Vargas de Marroquin reported that the Army is prepared to 
defend the country militarily. Nevertheless, Vargas said this 
problem must first be solved politically and that the Guatemalan 
Foreign Ministry has started to take specific actions to this 
end. "The defense minister visited the area and listened to the 
local residents' complaints and fears. He told them the Army is 
prepared to defend them, as it is its responsibility," she said. 
  According to the Army's official version, the problem is 
that 
there is no definite border between Guatemala and Belize. This 
has not led to an armed confrontation between the two armies, 
however, the source said. Maj. Vargas reported that the 
Guatemalan and Belizean troops stationed along the border area 
hold "peaceful" relations and avoid incidents. 
  It has been reported from Peten that combined British and 
Belizean troops continue to harass and intimidate hundreds of 
peasant families living in the area. The source added that 
these two armies have used sophisticated equipment, such as the 
Harrier plane, specially designed for heavy fighting. 
  On Tuesday, the peasants intimidated by these actions 
presented to the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office a petition 
reporting that foreign troops had entered their communities to 
evict them and seize their property. Sebastian Tux, leader of 
the affected communities, told this newspaper that Belizean 
soldiers arrived at their homes and ordered them to leave 
because the territory belonged to Belize.

<F P=106> [Report by Roger Suarez] </F>
  [Text] Vice President Virgilio Godoy told LA PRENSA that he 
does not think the threat of a suspension of U.S. aid to 
Nicaragua will be realized because the Clinton administration 
has already decided to support President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro until her mandate ends. 
  Last Friday the U.S. Congress approved the Helms-Gonzalez 
Amendment, which sets a 90-day deadline for countries that have 
not returned properties confiscated from U.S. citizens. This 
matter is a cause for great concern in Nicaragua as 
approximately 1,400 U.S. citizens have filed complaints. 
  Dr. Godoy does not believe that the threat of a suspension 
of 
aid will break the government's economic adjustment program 
"because the Clinton administration wants the Chamorro 
administration to fulfill its mandate without difficulties." 
  Godoy based his opinion on the "the unchanging attitude of 
U.S. Ambassador John Maisto" and the reaffirmation of that view 
by Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of State for 
inter-American affairs, during his visit to Nicaragua, two 
things that translate into clear support for Chamorro. 
  He described the latest news from Washington on the possible 
suspension as a "kind of blot or shadow." 
  "I believe this is merely an invitation to the government to 
respond to the complaints filed by U.S. citizens at the Attorney 
General's Office or with the government directly to either have 
their properties returned or be compensated," he noted. 
  Godoy expressed skepticism about a law to end the ownership 
problem "because one cannot simply say four years later that we 
should turn over a new leaf.... This calls for a high degree of 
understanding." 
  He added that the National Assembly may enact a law that 
will 
end the problem, "but it will do no good, since nobody will heed 
it. Let us remember that according to international law and the 
general principles of human rights, there is no statute of 
limitations on property rights." LA PRENSA asked Godoy if there 
is a solution to the ownership problem in Nicaragua. He replied: 
"It should have been resolved a long time ago. There was a way 
to do it, but the government or the presidency minister lacked 
the political commitment to do so." 
  The vice president affirmed that during a reception hosted 
by 
the Venezuelan Embassy, he told Presidency Minister Antonio 
Lacayo that "if they put the ownership problem in my hands, I 
could resolve it in 90 days." Godoy told Sandinist leader Daniel 
Ortega the same thing last year. 
  Godoy explained that there are different levels to the 
ownership problem, "and the main ones are the easiest to solve, 
but the remaining cases are very specific and must be settled by 
the courts. 
  Presidency Minister Lacayo confirmed that he spoke with 
Godoy 
on 8 September at the Venezuelan Embassy about the stability the 
country required and how it entailed a solution to this problem. 
  On 27 September, Godoy, Lacayo, and Sandinist leader Henry 
Ruiz met at the Spanish Embassy. "When I heard Ruiz and Godoy 
say that a solution to the ownership problem was feasible based 
on consensus, I asked them to draft a proposal endorsed by the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front and UNO [National Opposition 
Union]. (Godoy and Ruiz) shook hands," Lacayo stated. 
  Godoy later abruptly left the meeting. "I am still waiting 
for the proposal," Lacayo said.

  [Text] San Jose, 13 May (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Fernando Naranjo has called the appointment of Emile 
Jonassaint as acting president of Haiti disgraceful. Jonassaint 
took the oath of office last Wednesday. 
  Naranjo told the media that "the international democratic 
community cannot accept this maneuver by the Haitian military, 
led by General Raoul Cedras. It is intended to impose upon the 
country a president who does not represent the will of the 
people." 
  He added that "we cannot accept this new show of force by 
the 
Haitian military. We condemn the arbitrary appointment of 
Jonassaint and share the hope for a return to democracy in this 
Caribbean nation." 
  Naranjo affirmed that the Haitian crisis has had a 
detrimental affect on the people, who "grow ever poorer and 
suffer the tragedy of watching their civil rights diminished and 
violated every day."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential candidate Ernesto </F>
Perez Balladares in Panama City by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the 
"24 Hours" newscast on 10 May--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Presidential elections were held last 
Sunday in the Republic of Panama. The winner of the elections 
was Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who is in Panama City. Good 
evening, Dr. Perez Balladares. 
  [Perez] Good evening. 
  [Zabludovsky] How do you feel after the elections? 
  [Perez] Obviously, I am quite satisfied. I think this has 
been an extraordinary civic process by the Panamanian people. I 
greatly appreciate the massive support received through votes. 
Also, I am greatly appreciative of my adversaries, because we 
managed to conduct an extraordinary campaign with a high level 
of civic-mindedness and specific proposals. I am very 
proud--truly very proud--of the Panamanians and of the level of 
culture and political development we have demonstrated in this 
campaign of 1994. 
  [Zabludovsky] Everyone is asking the question: Who is Dr. 
Perez Balladares? 
  [Perez] I am an economist. I graduated in 1967, obtained a 
masters degree in economics in 1969, and a masters degree in 
finance in 1970. After that, I was a banker for five years. I 
then joined the government of Omar Torrijos, where I served from 
1976 until one year after his death, until 1983--excuse me, 
1982. I was finance and treasury minister. I was planning and 
economic policy minister. Since then I have been an active 
member of the Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
  [Zabludovsky] One of the topics that was raised by your 
enemies during the campaign was that there could be a rebirth of 
militarism with your victory in Panama. 
  [Perez] I think that, more than anything, that was an 
electoral attack, which has now ended. Many knew that was 
clearly false. First, all military regimes have been dismantled 
throughout not only the American continent, but also in Asia, 
Africa--everywhere. The justification that was used for its 
existence, the alleged retaining wall to curb the progress of 
what the United States identified as its enemies--international 
communism--has vanished. Now democracy is in vogue, and this is 
something we applaud. 
  The same thing is happening in Panama. Because of 
international geopolitical conditions, and because of domestic 
conditions, there cannot be a return to militarism. This is so 
true that today I dare say the next foreign minister of my 
government will be Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a man who, from the 
United States, strongly opposed the former military regime. 
Therefore, there can hardly be any threat of a return to the 
past. 
  [Zabludovsky] What type of government will you try to 
promote 
in your first 100 days? 
  [Perez] We have based all of our government proposals, our 
entire campaign, and all of our efforts on achieving the 
reconciliation of Panamanian society. This society was deeply 
divided during the final years of the military government and by 
the invasion. We have to achieve this, and we must take specific 
steps. This cannot remain a mere electoral pledge or an 
expression of goodwill. I have to dedicate myself to building on 
this pledge in the first 100 days, striving to achieve a 
government of national consensus and unity, to enable Panama to 
enter the 21st century as a united country and as a country of 
equal opportunity. Obviously, I must work to ensure this at a 
later date, but the first thing is to make sure that everyone 
perceives us as a government of unity, as a government disposed 
to making the best efforts with the best men and women available 
in order that this can be our goal within the next five years. 
  [Zabludovsky] For nearly 100 years, one of the most 
controversial topics in Panama has been the U.S. military 
presence there. A poll was conducted and many people believe the 
U.S. military should remain. What is your view on this? 
  [Perez] Let me clear up something first. What we have are 
polls, and it has been proven that polls in Panama somehow are 
not totally reliable, as was shown in the recent elections. What 
does exist is a statement by many who have been polled in the 
sense that there is a feeling of apprehension, of fear perhaps, 
regarding the possible departure of the U.S. military from 
Panama. 
  We cannot give in to this fear, which in the majority of 
cases is unfounded, because we Panamanians have not only the 
capability but also the willingness to oversee the 
administration of the Panama Canal. Most of these fears respond 
to things that the people themselves do not understand, perhaps 
because of a certain degree of evil within some people who have 
instilled this in the people's minds. For example, some say that 
if the North Americans leave, the U.S. dollar will leave. These 
are two completely different things, and yet, the man on the 
street does not understand that the U.S. dollar is circulating 
on the street, not because of the U.S. presence here, but 
because it is our sovereign decision to have this currency 
circulating in Panama, which we Panamanians earn with our sale 
of services and goods abroad. 
  The presence of U.S. military bases in Panama is defined in 
the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. They clearly state that by 31 
December 1999, there should not be one single U.S. soldier in 
Panama. The presence of bases in any part of the world by any 
foreign power cannot be justified by economic issues. Military 
bases exist in any part of the world when there is a military 
interest in protection or aggression [as heard]. I do not think 
this is the case in Panama. The historic justification for the 
existence or presence of military bases in Panama, which was to 
defend the interoceanic waterway when the U.S. strategic weapon 
was the Navy, has disappeared. Nor is the Panama Canal 
threatened. In turn, we Panamanians do not see any reason, from 
a military standpoint, for there to be bases in Panama, at least 
not with the justifications used in the past. 
  If there is any other reason for a small or medium-sized 
U.S. 
military presence in Panama, the United States would have to say 
what it is and propose it to the Panamanians. Then we would have 
to look at our national interests, strictly from a security and 
military viewpoint. The positive or negative consequences of the 
permanence of U.S. troops in Panama because of economic issues 
is not a basis for such a decision. That is something altogether 
different, and it cannot be the fundamental criterion for 
agreeing to or opposing a U.S. military presence in Panama. 
  Let us suppose there is an additional interest on the part 
of 
the United States to maintain some presence in Panama. I can 
think, for example, of let us say the struggle against drug 
trafficking. If there is an interest on the part of the United 
States in this, then we would have to see what the terms and 
conditions are. Anything that might be agreed upon would then 
have to be submitted to a national referendum, because that is 
not a decision that can be made exclusively by the executive or 
legislative branch. It would have to be subjected to a 
referendum by the Panamanian people.

  [Text] Santiago, 13 May (EFE) -- Allen Kilpatrick, Canadian 
international trade vice minister, said here today that he 
firmly supports Chile's entry into NAFTA. 
  Today Kilpatrick participated in the signing of a $20 
million 
loan agreement that will be used to finance the purchasing of 
equipment for the new Panque Hydroelectric Power Plant that is 
being built in southern Chile. 
  The Canadian official stressed that in his government's 
opinion "there are no inadequacies whatsoever" preventing 
Chile's incorporation into NAFTA, and that Ottawa has officially 
communicated its favorable stance to Santiago. 
  Initial reports indicate that Chile's incorporation could be 
"relatively quick" because only a few changes "of little 
importance" would be necessary, Kilpatrick added. 
  The minister said Canadian participation in NAFTA was 
positive, adding that even though the agreement was extended to 
include Mexico in January 1994, trade between the two countries 
had already started to increase. 
  Allen Kilpatrick emphasized the importance of Canadian 
investments in Chile, which total $3 billion and are mainly 
concentrated in the mining area. Kilpatrick added that current 
studies contemplate additional investments of $1 billion in 
Chile.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Army has 
revealed that it found at least five remote-controlled bombs, 
which guerrillas planned to set off today on the helicopter of 
Santander Department Governor Juan Carlos Duarte. According to 
the military report, the bombs had been planted by the rebels on 
the runway at the terminal area of Malaga, located some 370 km 
from Santa Fe de Bogota. Governor Duarte and his entourage were 
scheduled to land in Malaga. 
  According to Army sources, after the bombs were detected in 
Malaga, authorities decided to divert Duarte's plane. The 
source added that five suspects were captured in connection with 
this failed action. 
  The Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
[CNGSB], made up of 12,000 combatants, is engaged in an 
offensive to hinder the 29 May presidential elections. As a 
result, the incident in Malaga has not been ruled out to be 
associated with the sabotage campaign by the CNGSB. The report 
indicates that the Army of National Liberation -- a CNGSB group 
-- operates in the Garcia Rovira area, where the attempt against 
Duarte was planned. 
  Duarte, who was preparing to inaugurate various social 
welfare projects in the area, said that despite the failed 
attempt, he will continue touring the department. Santander is 
among the most unstable departments nationwide. 
  According to the source, the Army arrested four guerrillas 
and seized weapons and political propaganda in Antioquia 
Department during operations to guarantee normal elections on 29 
May. 
  Two years ago, the CNGSB chose not to participate in peace 
negotiations held by the government of President Cesar Gaviria 
in Tlaxcala, Mexico because of disagreements on the agenda to be 
discussed.

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 14 May (EFE) -- Today the Chilean 
Government insisted that it would be inconvenient if Carabineros 
Director General Rodolfo Stange resumed his activities on 17 May 
when his special leave permit, which he requested when he was 
brought to court, expires. 
  Secretary General of Government Victor Rebolledo read a 
communique drafted during a two-hour meeting with President 
Eduardo Frei and other political ministers. 
  The government believes it would be a "highly critical 
political and moral problem" if Gen. Stange returns to the 
Carabineros high command. 
  In Rebolledo's opinion, it is "useless" to continue arguing 
about legal aspects of Gen. Stange's situation. 
  The official communique disclosed today reiterates the 
validity of Frei's arguments on 5 April when he requested 
Stange's resignation after Judge Milton Juica asked that he be 
tried on charges of "omission of military duties." [passage 
omitted] 
  There are reports that Stange, the day after returning to 
work on 17 May, will travel to northern Chile for a month to 
avoid having to attend the opening of Congress sessions on 21 
May. 
  Gen. Stange was questioned twice this week by Martial Court 
Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer on "omission of military duties." Cesar 
Mendoza also has appeared in court on the same charges.

Government House] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma reported that 
Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange will resume his 
duties on 17 May. 
  Extensive meetings were held throughout this morning at 
Government House to discuss Gen. Stange's announced return to

  After a briefing by the ministers in charge of political 
affairs, they informed the presidents of the different parties 
that make up the CPPD [Coalition of Parties for Democracy] about 
the steps the government will be taking in this regard. 
  Here is what Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] The latest report the Defense 
Ministry has on hand is that Gen. Stange will resume his post on 
17 May sometime in the morning and that he will be leaving on a 
tour of the northern region the following day. 
  That is the latest official information the Defense Ministry 
has on hand. 
  [First unidentified reporter] Does the government have any 
hopes that this situation will change...? 
  [Second unidentified reporter, interrupting]...Has there 
been 
any specific request submitted by Carabineros to repeal the 
decree that sent Stange on a two-month leave? 
  [Perez Yoma] I believe that [Defense Ministry Under 
Secretary for Carabineros Affairs] Luciano Fouilloux clearly 
explained everything on 15 May pertaining to any decrees issued, 
and which the government believes are unimportant. 
  [Third unidentified reporter] The truth is that Gen. Stange 
resumes his duties on 17 May. 
  [Perez Yoma] The truth is that the Defense Ministry has 
received a notice in which Gen. Stange reports his intention of 
resuming his duties on 17 May and of starting a tour of the 
northern region. [end recording] 
  Defense Minister Perez Yoma said that ties between the 
government and Carabineros at this time are smooth. 
  Carabineros has reasserted that Gen. Rodolfo Stange will 
resume his duties on 17 May. 
  Unlike what happened last week, today Gen. Stange did not 
visit his Carabineros headquarters office. Despite his 
announced return, there was no unusual activity here today aside 
from the Santiago Garrison Generals Corps' routine Monday 
morning meetings. 
  We learned this morning that Gen. Stange remained at home, 
where he met the Carabineros legal adviser, General Carlos 
Pecchi, who was again approached by the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Pecchi] Everything already has been said. 
Don't insist. All right? 
  [First unidentified reporter] General, but did you discuss 
today the tour that was announced by the under secretary?... 
  [Pecchi, interrupting] ...I am not allowed to answer 
anything. 
  [Second unidentified reporter]... How is Gen. Stange? 
  [Pecchi] Very well, very well... 
  [Second reporter, interrupting]..Yes? 
  [Pecchi, interrupting] ...Very well, very well. 
  [Second reporter, interrupting] .. What has he done during 
the past few weeks? 
  [Pecchi, interrupting] .. Very well, very well... 
  [Second reporter, interrupting] ... Calm? 
  [Pecchi, interrupting]...Calm, very well... 
  [Second reporter, interrupting] ...How about Carabineros?... 
  [Pecchi, interrupting] ...Everything is very calm. Thank 
you. 
[end recording] 
  Despite recent government statements, the Carabineros corps 
takes it for granted that Gen. Stange returns on 17 May. 
Carabineros sources reported that details are being discussed 
for his official return.

  [Text] Luciano Fouilloux, the Defense Ministry under 
secretary for Carabineros affairs, has stated that there are 
clear legal obstacles facing General Rodolfo Stange's return to 
duty tomorrow as the Carabineros director general. 
  Interior Minister German Correa also referred to this 
subject: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Minister, is the 
government facing difficulties over the Stange case? 
  [Correa] No, the government is not facing difficulties. 
Undoubtedly it is a complex matter but the government is very 
solid, very strong. A government that enjoys the support of 58 
percent of the citizenry can hardly face difficulties. The 
government, moreover, has received broad support from all 
sectors of the country regarding this subject -- except the 
opposition, of course, which has politicized the subject. 
Undoubtedly, the government has the support of all other 
sectors of the country. 
  [Reporter] Do you believe the problem will be solved soon? 
  [Correa] I hope the problem will gradually be solved for the 
sake of Carabineros and the country. [end recording] 
  Regarding debates over decrees, vacations, or other types of 
leave, Fouilloux said that the government believes there are 
ethical and moral aspects that make it inconvenient for Gen. 
Stange to return to his activities. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are there any 
legal 
obstacles to his return on Tuesday, 17 May? 
  [Fouilloux] There is a legal-administrative obstacle. There 
is no doubt about that. His two months leave without pay -- 
which he requested and the government authorized -- has not 
expired. Unless it is suspended or the government decides to 
cancel it, there is an obstacle. I have reiterated this and 
Carabinero representatives and even the experts who have been 
advising Gen. Stange agree. 
  [Reporter] What will the government do when Stange resumes 
his activities? 
  [Fouilloux] We do not know if he will resume his activities. 
  [Reporter] Is that not definite yet? 
  [Fouilloux] Well, as I have already stated, Gen. Stange has 
issued a note expressing his desire to resume his activities on 
17 May. On the other hand, there are those who do not want him 
to resume his duties because they say there is an administrative 
obstacle. We do not know what Gen. Stange will do on 17 May.

<F P=106> [Live report by Jose Ignacio Aguirre from the Defense </F>
Ministry building] 
  [Text] After meeting for more than two hours, Defense 
Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma and Carabineros Director General 
Rodolfo Stange finally reached an agreement on the thorny issue 
involving Gen. Stange. After the meeting, the government issued 
a communique, which was read by the defense minister himself. 
Let us listen: 
  [Begin Perez Yoma recording] The national defense minister, 
who is now addressing public opinion, has entrusted the 
Carabineros director general -- who had acquiesced with this 
request -- with the task of drafting a study within 30 days to 
streamline the institution he heads. The Defense Ministry deems 
that this task is of the highest national interest. Hence, the 
director general will have to discharge this duty by giving it 
precedence over all other regular duties. To this effect, he 
will delegate all the power that the Carabineros Organizational 
Law allows him to the Carabineros deputy director general. 
Thank you. [end recording] 
  This is the communique released by the defense minister, who 
confirmed the reports that were leaked this morning at the 
ministry indicating there would be surprises in the way Gen. 
Stange would resume office. As has been heard, he will devote 
himself to the streamlining of the Carabineros police. The 
duties of director general as such will be discharged by the 
deputy commander, who is the current acting director general, 
General [Fernando] Cordero. This is all the information we have 
at the Defense Ministry. Thank you.

PRC president, Franco said that he laments the cancellation, and 
reiterates his willingness to support cooperation projects

  Senator Jarbas Passarinho, Senator Jose Sarney, and 
Brazilian 
Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira had advised 
Franco to avoid being absent from the country during the

in the public sector, according to presidential advisers. In 
addition, a presidential absence would be negative for the

<F P=106> [Report by Biaggio Talento, including interview with Cuban </F>
President Fidel Castro, in Salvador, Bahia State on 12 May] 
  [Text] Salvador -- Cuban President Fidel Castro made a 
12-hour stopover in the capital of Bahia upon his return from 
South Africa after participating in Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration. Castro granted an interview to ESTADO in which he 
spoke about the economic blockade imposed on Cuba, Luis Inacio 
Lula da Silva's position on the blockade, and Cuban policies. 
He was rather confused about the situation of former Bahia 
Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who is now running for a seat 
in the Senate. "Here in Brazil officials must resign their 
posts six months before the elections if they want to compete in 
them," Magalhaes explained. "You are addicted to holding 
elections every month," Castro joked, provoking laughs among the 
guests of a banquet in his honor offered by Governor Antonio 
Imbassahy at Ondina Palace. He provoked even louder laughs when 
he said he was surprised to find so few presidential candidates 
in Brazil this year: "Brazilians could even reach the 
conclusion that a single candidate policy might be best." 
  [Talento] What is Cuba doing to break the economic embargo? 
  [Castro] We are doing everything possible. There is a 
movement against the blockade that is gaining momentum in the 
United States. Only two or three nations support the blockade in 
the United Nations. Cuba resisted, is resisting, and will 
continue to resist. 
  [Talento] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva called for an end to the blockade against 
Cuba during his visit to the United States. What is your 
opinion on his position? 
  [Castro] I appreciate it a lot. He always held that 
position. Many politicians and, in general, many members of 
progressive and democratic groups in the world are also opposed 
to the blockade. 
  [Talento] What are your expectations regarding the economic 
plan now under implementation in Cuba? 
  [Castro] It is not a new economic plan. We are implementing 
a series of measures. We are developing an opening adjusted to 
the special conditions we are living under today, without 
renouncing our social victories. The National Assembly adopted 
a series of measures seeking to straighten out our internal 
financial situation. 
  [Talento] What do these new measures change? 
  [Castro] They seek to reduce the excessive volume of money 
in 
circulation. Despite our current difficulties we did not throw 
anyone into the streets, or sacrifice our social and educational 
programs. 
  [Talento] Are there any changes in public utility rates? 
  [Castro] Yes. We changed some utility rates. We adjusted 
electricity and fuel prices. We also increased taxes on 
superfluous items, such as cigarettes and cigars. We will try 
to maintain basic items' current prices. 
  [Talento] The world is splitting into markets. What prevents 
Latin America from having its own market? 
  [Castro] The U.S. economy is in crisis as a result of the 
strong competition from other blocs (Europe, Asia), and wants to 
control the Latin American market completely. But many Latin 
American countries have stronger trade relations with Europe 
than with the United States. These countries have the 
obligation to defend regional mechanisms such as Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, or the Central 
American market in order to prevent the United States from 
completely absorbing them. 
  [Talento] There is a lot of talk about Cuba's need to 
implement political reform. Is there any trend pointing in that 
direction? 
  [Castro] There is a tendency to ignore all the reforms 
introduced by Cuba in the past few years. These reforms have 
just as much quality and democratic spirit than the reforms made 
by many other countries. But we do not have access to the 
multinationals that control the information, and our reforms are 
little known. 
  [Talento] Do you still have another meeting after you leave 
here today (it was after 0100)? 
  [Castro] I have a meeting with Morpheus [one of the gods of 
dreams in Greek mythology]. (laughs) 
  [Talento] Will you visit the city? 
  [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from 
Cuba for over a week. 
  [Talento] At what time are you leaving? 
  [Castro] It is a military secret. (laughs)

Mozambique. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim discussed the issue 
with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and only budget, 
technical, and military logistical matters have yet to be 
resolved with the United Nations. Amorim said: 
  [Begin recording] In any case, the UN secretary general 
again 
conveyed to me that he is interested. We are now discussing 
budget, technical, and even military logistical matters with the 
United Nations, i.e. whether we will be sending a battalion or a 
company. A battalion consists of 700 men, while a company 
consists of more than 200 men. We will probably be sending a 
battalion to Mozambique. [end recording] 
  The cost of sending an Army battalion stands at 
approximately 
$40 million, which will be reimbursed by the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Romania will open a consulate in Sao Paulo, and 
Brazil will also establish a consulate in a Romanian city that 
has yet to be decided. Besides agreeing on this, on 11 May both 
countries signed an agreement providing for bilateral political 
consultations. 
  Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, who is making a 
state visit to Brazil, met with President Itamar Franco on 11 
May and expressed his country's interest in signing another two 
agreements -- one on the promotion and protection of 
investments, and another one to do away with double taxation. 
  Two business deals between both countries that are deemed 
promising are the supply of railroad ties and equipment for the 
Soybean Railroad [Ferrovia da Soja] which is currently under 
construction, financed by businessman Olacyr de Moraes; and the 
export of the SIAF [Integrated System of Financial 
Administration] of the Federal Data Processing Service (Serpro) 
for accounting and budget control. According to a source close 
to Itamaraty, the IMF has recommended the SIAF. This system has 
already been bought by Angola and Paraguay. The problem Romania 
encounters in purchasing this system is lack of financing. 
  According to Vacaroiu, his country is interested in mounting 
an assembly line for ARO-24 all-terrain vehicles. This business 
venture is being undertaken with the Brazilian company Embramil 
[Brazilian Missile Company], which is interested in the transfer 
of Romanian technology for the manufacturing of different types 
of bombs. 
  The prime minister announced that the Romanian company Rocar 
is also interested in manufacturing utility vehicles in the 
Manaus free zone. Rocar would also like to supply ambulances to 
Rio de Janeiro State, which has yet to obtain the funds for this 
business transaction. 
  Vacaroiu will visit Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation] and the Rio Doce Valley Company today, and will 
have a luncheon with businessmen from the Rio de Janeiro Trade 
Association. Tomorrow he will travel to Sao Paulo, where he 
will visit Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] and Fiesp 
[Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries]. Romania intends to 
purchase planes without engines from Embraer. The engines would 
be supplied by a Romanian company, which manufactures the 
product under license from a foreign company.

  [Text] Army troops have withdrawn from Federal Police [PF] 
buildings in Porto Alegre and Foz do Iguacu, but they are still 
occupying PF facilities in Sao Paulo. 
  The order to withdraw from Foz do Iguacu came late in the 
afternoon. The 180 Army soldiers who have been guarding the 
Brazilian border with Paraguay for the past four days quickly 
boarded their trucks and returned to barracks. 
  Army troops are still occupying the three PF buildings in 
Sao 
Paulo. Traffic remains closed and pedestrians have only limited 
access to the area. Army sentries continue to monitor the area 
from the roof of the main building. 
  Although Planalto Palace authorized the withdrawal of 
troops, 
the Army will not withdraw in Sao Paulo until it becomes certain 
that the PF strikers will resume basic services. The Army 
southeast regional commander will decide when to withdraw the 
troops. 
  Complying with orders from President Itamar Franco, Justice 
Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat will meet again tomorrow morning 
with members of the Chamber of Deputies National Defense 
Committee in an attempt to resume negotiations and end the PF 
strike.

  [Text] The president of the Republic, engineer Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, yesterday reported that there are people and segments 
who want to destabilize his government. Although he did not 
supply any names, he described these people and segments as 
professionals of "showiness [vedettismo] and populism who 
sometimes use `ungodly' methods." Wasmosy made these remarks 
after inaugurating the Paraguayan Airlines [Aerolineas 
Paraguayas] (Arpa) flights at the international airport. 
  Wasmosy openly complained because he believes there are 
people and segments who, through "showiness and populism, and 
sometimes using ungodly methods," are seeking to destabilize his 
government. He noted that despite this situation, the Paraguayan 
people and the Armed Forces "welcome the Arpa company." The 
president did not identify the people and segments he was 
talking about, but his remarks were interpreted as referring to 
people and segments who have recently been criticizing him, like 
trade union and peasant leaders, especially after the 2 May 
incidents during the nationwide strike called by the United 
Workers Trade Union Federation (CUT), the National Workers 
Federation (CNT), and the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers 
(CPT). 
  Entrepreneurs are also consistently criticizing the Wasmosy 
administration, claiming it is ineffective in the struggle 
against corruption. 
  Asked about a demonstration held on the evening of 13 May by 
various segments of the public, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta 
said: "They gathered and dispersed in an orderly manner. The 
criticism against the government is part of a script drawn up by 
some people who participated in the march of silence." 
  The interior minister noted that not all the people who 
participated in the march had the same goal. He emphasized: 
"Some of my relatives participated in the march, and they have 
different beliefs." 
  Moving on, the interior minister emphasized that it is 
necessary to mention that this type of demonstration may be held 
under the state of law, and that when they are held within the 
rules of the game, all demonstrations are held normally, as it 
is appropriate. 
  Asked about the consistent efforts to have Congress 
interpellate him, the interior minister said he is willing to go 
to Congress whenever he is called in order to supply all the 
information that congressmen might require. He emphasized: "I am 
a public servant, and I have the duty of reporting to the people 
whenever it is appropriate or necessary." 
  Podesta rejected reports that the government is allegedly 
preparing some court actions against trade union leaders and 
journalists. He concluded by saying: "I have actually been 
informed that there are people who have felt that their 
interests have been harmed, and that these people are 
considering the possibility of filing court actions, but the 
government has no part in these cases."

  [Text] Army Commander General Lino Oviedo said yesterday 
that the military forces who left their barracks to overthrow 
the Stroessnerist dictatorship will continue defending democracy 
"to the last day of our lives, whether from the inside or 
outside of the Armed Forces." Oviedo said the military will 
perform social works in the interior "without their weapons" if 
these works are ordered by the commander in chief. He made it 
clear that he will retire from the military if he is ordered to 
use his weapons against peasants. Oviedo also denied charges 
made by opposition politicians who accused him of being one of 
the main elements destabilizing President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's 
government. 
  The Army commander said that the defense of the democratic 
system installed in the country following the coup that deposed 
Stroessner was a matter of consistency. "At least those of us 
who left the barracks on the night of 2 and 3 February must be 
consistent. We are going to be consistent to the last days of 
our lives, whether from the inside or outside of the Armed 
Forces," Oviedo said, repeating Wasmosy's words that the 
military and the people will defend democracy in our country. 
  Asked if he was aware of the existence of groups of people 
who are attempting to destabilize President Wasmosy's 
government, Oviedo answered: "The best informed person in the 
country is our commander in chief. He gives us the information 
we know. If he says so, it must be so," Oviedo said. 
  The Army commander said the violence that affected our 
country lately "will end." He made clear, however, that the 
Armed Forces will always act according to the Constitution, our 
laws, and military regulations. 
  "We will follow our commander in chief's orders. We will 
follow his instructions and what is established in the 
Constitution," Oviedo added. 
  He also promised to defend this and other government in the 
future "with everything in his hands." He reiterated that at 
this time he does not have a possible presidential candidacy in 
mind. 
  Oviedo also said if the commander in chief decides that the 
military must cooperate in social works in the interior of the 
country, the military will follow orders. "We will be very glad 
to work with our soldiers in the interior," Oviedo said. 
  The commander warned, however, that he will not have "the 
courage" to use his weapons against peasants even if the 
commander in chief orders him to do so. "I would retire from the 
Army if this were the case," he said. 
  Yesterday morning Wasmosy and Oviedo presided over the 
traditional military parade in front of government palace to 
commemorate the 183rd anniversary of our independence. Army, 
Navy, and Air Force units participated in the parade. 
Detachments of the National Police also paraded in front of the 
official stage. 
  Brazilian and Argentine naval forces participated in the 
military parade, receiving long applause from the public 
watching the ceremony. 
  Later the president received a delegation of indigenous 
people. Indian leaders complained about their urgent need for 
land, food, health, and education

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 May (EFE) -- The Economy Ministry 
corrected an announcement made by Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo concerning the alleged three-month postponement of the 
implementation of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). 
  A mistake by an official seemingly misrepresented Cavallo's 
remarks in the ROK, which had caused surprise in domestic 
political, diplomatic, and economic spheres. 
  According to official information, Cavallo had announced in 
Seoul that Mercosur would go into effect on 1 April 1995, with a 
three-month delay in its original schedule. 
  When three hours had elapsed since the information's release 
and after journalists' insistence on learning the reason why the 
Argentine economy minister unilaterally announced the alleged 
postponement, an Economy Ministry official acknowledged that he 
made a mistake "when transcribing the tape" on which Cavallo's 
remarks had been recorded. 
  Having met with the ROK's minister of the Economic Planning 
Board, Chae-sok Chong, Cavallo commented that "Mercosur will 
grow at a faster pace than NAFTA." 
  To support his statement, Cavallo noted that the Mercosur 
member countries' economies are "undergoing tremendous growth, 
as evinced by the Argentine case."

  [Text] Bariloche (Argentina), 16 May (EFE) -- Argentine 
President Carlos Menem announced on 16 May that his country will 
request the extradition of Margaret Thatcher, the UK's former 
head of government, "in case it is proved" that the General 
Belgrano cruiser's sinking during the Malvinas war was a war 
crime. 
  During a news conference today in Bariloche, located at the 
foot of the Andes Mountains, where he opened the Fourth 
Ibero-American Computer Science and Justice Congress, Menem 
said: "It has to be determined whether the ship's sinking was a 
war crime or not."

  [Text] Moscow, 16 May (EFE) -- Russia and Argentina further 
strengthened their links today. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella signed 
agreements which stress that relations between their two 
countries extend beyond the bilateral level and into the 
international field. 
  Russian-Argentine relations are "an important element in 
Russia's relations with Latin America due to Argentina's 
importance in the region," Kozyrev said as he received his 
Argentine counterpart. 
  At the end of the first part of the negotiation, Di Tella 
praised Russia's "extraordinary progress" in the last few years, 
stressing that the two countries now share a "philosophy" which 
makes possible the discussion of security issues--as was done 
today--"in the same language." 
  The basic document signed by Kozyrev and Di Tella is a 
preliminary agreement on the "bases for Argentine and Russian 
Federation relations." The Argentine foreign minister said the 
two countries' presidents will sign a definitive agreement in 
Moscow in six months to one year. 
  The two officials also signed a protocol for "consultation" 
between their respective foreign affairs departments and an 
agreement to eliminate the visa requirement for diplomatic and 
service personnel. 
  Di Tella arrived in Moscow from Saint Petersburg for a 
three-day official visit at the invitation of his Russian 
counterpart. He visited Turkmenistan on 12 and 13 May. 
Turkmenistan is a former Soviet Republic located in Central Asia 
where Argentine companies have important investments. 
  Kozyrev recalled that Argentina is this year a nonpermanent 
member of the UN Security Council while Russia is a permanent 
member. He added that this is reason enough for the two 
countries to maintain close bilateral and "global" relations. 
  Kozyrev said that Argentina is one of the "key" countries in 
Latin America, adding that Russia is currently strengthening its 
relations with the region and is sponsoring Russian cooperation 
through regional political institutions, particularly the OAS 
and regional countries' economic groups. 
  Spokesman Mikhail Demurin said recently that Russia 
considers 
Argentina to be "its largest and most promising partner in Latin 
America." 
  Di Tella said that Argentina and Russia are old friends, 
adding that never before during this century relations have been 
better than now. Di Tella described what is occurring in the 
Russian Federation as "admirable," stressing that Russia 
deserves to be respected as "a great power." 
  The Argentine minister added that Russia and Argentina are 
part of the new world process which is based on peace, 
cooperation, and mutual respect. 
  Di Tella's entourage includes numerous foreign officials, 
leaders of the ruling and opposition parties in Congress, and 
several entrepreneurs. Argentine Ambassador to Russia Juan 
Carlos Olima, Coordination General Under Secretary Andres 
Cisneros, and Foreign Policy Under Secretary Rogelio Pfirter are 
among those who accompanied the foreign minister during his 
meeting with Kozyrev. 
  After the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, the 
Russian foreign minister offered a luncheon in honor of his 
counterpart and his delegation. 
  International Economic Relations Secretary Jorge Campbell, 
International Cooperation Director General Eduardo Perez, and 
Argentine entrepreneurs met meanwhile with Vladimir Karastin, 
the foreign economic relations vice minister, and Russian 
entrepreneurs. 
  Russia's new situation "demands much imagination in order to 
do business. We now need to know each other better," Campbell 
told EFE. Campbell was an expert Argentine negotiator with the 
former USSR. He emphasizes the favorable changes taking place in 
Russia. 
  Argentine entrepreneurs told their hosts about their desire 
to do business through a counterbalanced trade mechanism. 
  Di Tella will meet later today with Yegor Gaidar, "the 
father" of Russian reform and leader of the "Russian Option" 
party; and with Grigory Yablinski, a notable economist and 
member of Boris Yeltsin's moderate opposition. 
  Tonight the foreign minister will have a chance to speak 
with 
the entire spectrum of Russian politicians who have been invited 
to a reception at the Argentine Embassy.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 May (EFE) -- Argentine Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella today proposed to his Russian colleague, Andrey 
Kozyrev, the reactivation of a mechanism for payment 
compensation that the two countries signed but are not 
implementing. He granted Russia a $30-million line of credit for 
Argentine exports. 
  Di Tella told EFE that this mechanism ensures that credit 
and 
debt columns are closed and the difference is paid. 
  Argentina currently owes Russia about $150 million and 
therefore wants to resume exports to Moscow. 
  The foreign minister added that the $30-million line of 
credit is not included in the compensation mechanism that 
Argentina wants to implement. 
  Di Tella stated that during today's political talks with 
Kozyrev, on the first day of his three-day official visit to 
Moscow, that he indicated the time has come to maintain complete 
and fruitful relations because Russia has a greater trade 
"focus." 
  The foreign minister stated earlier that Russia and 
Argentina 
are a part of the new world process in which rapprochement 
between nations is made on the basis of peace, cooperation, and 
mutual respect. 
  The Argentine foreign minister expressed surprise over the 
situation in Russia which is much better than what one reads and 
hears from afar--especially the remarks of the ultranationalist 
Vladimir Yirinovsky, whose Liberal Democratic Party won the most 
recent parliamentary elections. 
  "One can see that this country is moving and it will have a 
lot of influence" when it overcomes its crisis in less time than 
most people believe, Di Tella said. 
  The foreign minister stated that Russia is "a great power 
with problems," but when it overcomes them "there is no doubt" 
it will be one of the world's great powers. 
  Di Tella will meet with Vice Premier Alexandr Shojin on 17 
May. During the meeting he will again discuss the economic 
agreement and the viability of increasing Argentine exports to 
Russia. 
  "I am discovering that no one is against reform," Di Tella 
said, although they differ over time spans and tactics. 
  During his meeting today with the architects of these 
reforms--Yegor Gaidar and economist Grigori Yablinski, who is 
the leader of the moderate opposition--Di Tella plans to find 
out "the depth of the dangers facing the reform." 
  Following his 14 May meetings with the progressive mayor of 
Saint Petersburg and with his Russian colleague, Di Tella said 
that "when one speaks with (Anatoly) Sobchak and Kozyrev, one 
can see that they are sensible people."

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 16 May (NA) -- [Passage omitted] 
[U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike] Espy held a news conference 
with Felipe Sola, his Argentine colleague, at the Economy 
Ministry after meeting with Economy Vice Minister Carlos Sanchez. 
  The U.S. official arrived on 13 May (his visit is part of a 
trip that will take him to Brazil on 17 May and finally to 
Mexico). He also met with President Carlos Menem, Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella, and with the Senate and Chamber of 
Deputies Agriculture Committees. 
  Espy and Sola termed their talks as "excellent and 
fruitful." 
The Argentine official insisted on the global need to eradicate 
dumping [preceding word in English] and subsidies. 
  "I told Espy that maintaining our share of the Brazilian 
market is our main concern," said Sola, adding: "We asked for 
political priority in sanitary and phyto-sanitary [sanitarios y 
fitosanitarios] fields." 
  Sola indicated that on 6 June a "high level" U.S. delegation 
will visit the country to study the phyto-sanitary situation and 
the conclusions of this delegation will be decisive in the 
purchase of Argentine beef by the United States. [sentence as 
received] [passage omitted] 
  Espy's remarks have a political interpretation because 
Argentina currently maintains a strong tug-of-war with the 
United States over the Pharmaceutical Patents Law. On several 
occasions, U.S. Ambassador James Cheek has supported a solomonic 
decision: Patents for subsidies. [passage omitted]

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi 
became the third Radical politician to throw his hat into the 
presidential ring yesterday, just one day after Federal Capital 
Senator Fernando de la Rua confirmed that he too would seek the 
nation's top elected office. 
  Massaccesi said during an appearance on the lunchtime 
television talk show "Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand" that his 
goal was "to make a contribution to society and the party." 
  The governor also told Rio Negro leaders gathered in the 
Federal Capital that he planned to open a round of talks with 
party officials beginning on Wednesday in Catamarca and Jujuy. 
  Massaccesi followed closely in the footsteps of De la Rua, 
who announced on Thursday night that he would seek to replace 
President Carlos Menem in 1995. 
  "This is one of the (Radical Party's) most critical moments 
in its long history of service to the country," the senator told 
members of his Participation Movemement. "I am willing to assume 
the responsibility of being a candidate." 
  Meanwhile, Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who has already 
expressed interest in running next year as he did in 1989, said 
he was sympathetic to the ruling Justicialist determination to 
retain the Constituent Assembly's presidency and first 
vice-presidency. 
  Angeloz said that the Justicialists would not want to leave 
a 
Radical delegate in charge of the assembly if the head of state 
were to leave the country and his brother, Senate Provisional 
President Eduardo Menem, had taken over the national presidency 
as provisional Senate chief.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 May (NA) -- The Argentine Coast 
Guard has reported that a Ukrainian factory ship was caught 
today fishing illegally in the exclusive economic zone, 198.6 
nautical miles off Buenos Aires Province. 
  The Coast Guard cutter Prefecto Fique intercepted the 
Ukrainian-flagged Koronometr at 0100 today with its nets 
deployed. The decision was made to board it. 
  The coast guard crew confirmed that the large factory ship, 
which has an overall length of 83 meters, was transporting 56.8 
tonnes of fish meal and 32.7 tonnes of processed squid which had 
been caught in Argentine territorial waters without 
authorization. 
  Confirming the infringement, the captain of the Ukrainian 
vessel was made to sail toward Mar del Plata port, where it will 
arrive tomorrow at 1000 local time to face charges of violation 
of domestic fishing laws. 
  These laws provide for the seizure of the illegal catch and 
the payment of a fine that can go as high as $1 million.

  [Text] (NA) -- Former de facto president, retired General 
Alejandro Lanusse was sentenced to 10 days arrest by the Army 
over the weekend for publicly criticizing the government, 
unofficial sources said yesterday [15 May]. 
  A local news agency reported that Lanusse has been under 
arrest at the Military Hospital since Saturday [14 May]. Army 
Chief-of-Staff Lieutenant General Martin Balza ordered Lanusse's 
detention, which will extend until May 25, said the sources. 
  Lanusse asserted last week during a cable television 
programme that the governments of former General Juan Peron and 
the current Justicialist administration were "the most corrupt" 
he had known. 
  The retired general--who headed a three-man ruling junta 
from 
1971 to 1973--also said that Balza should not have taken a 
personal interest in the alleged murder of recruit Omar Carrasco 
at a military base in Neuquen. His opinions are said to have 
been taken into account by the Army's top brass in ordering the 
arrest.

  [Excerpts] Lima, 13 May (EFE) -- The bomb attacks 
perpetrated in Lima last night have made people fear a new 
outbreak of terrorist actions in the next few days, to mark the 
14th anniversary of the beginning of Shining Path's [SL] 
subversive activities. 
  The Maoist group perpetrated its first attack on 17 May 
1980, 
and since then more than 30,000 people have died as a result of 
political violence. 
  Several explosions last night shook the offices of local 
banks in the districts of Surquillo, San Martin de Porres, San 
Juan de Lurigancho, and Brena and in the industrial zone in 
Lima, wounding at least four people and causing material damage. 
  These attacks follow similar ones that occurred between 4 
and 
5 May in Villa Militar, in the coastal Lima district of 
Chorillos, at bank branches and at an office of the public 
enterprise Electro Lima. 
  Since then security forces have stepped up patrolling in 
Lima 
and in the port of Callao, as a preventive measure in case a 
wave of terrorism takes place on the SL anniversary. 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has 
expressed fear that the Maoist group could unleash a wave of 
attacks and crimes in Lima, ordered by its current leader Oscar 
Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano." [passage omitted] 
  The SL celebrates its 14th anniversary in the midst of 
internal divisions, and weakened by the harassment of the Armed 
Forces, which since 5 April have been conducting a new offensive 
against the subversive columns in the jungle area of Huanuco 
Department. 
  The SL's attacks are no longer as fierce as they were before 
the arrest of its main leader [Abimael Guzman] on 12 September 
1992. 
  Political violence has caused 30,215 deaths in Peru since 
1980, of which 14,239 are alleged terrorists, 12,932 civilians, 
and 2,737 member of the security forces, as well as 307 drug 
traffickers. This information was published by the magazine 
PERUPAZ of the Constitution and Society Institute.

  [Text] Lima, 16 May (EFE) -- A car bomb exploded today, 
Monday, in front of the Bank of Credit in San Borja district in 
Lima. There were no reports of injuries. The explosion affected 
nearby shops and residences, and the police have cordoned off 
the area to establish the amount of explosives used. 
  The car used in the attack was a 1970 "Hillman" that was 
stolen yesterday from a noncommissioned police officer. 
  Another car bomb exploded on 15 May in the Miraflores 
residential district, causing damage to a pension fund building 
and to nearby shops and residences, but there were no reports of 
injuries, either. 
  The series of attacks are attributed to the armed Maoist 
group Shining Path, on the eve of 17 May, the 14th anniversary 
of its first attack. In those 14 years, more than 30,000 have 
died and $20 million have been reported in losses caused by 
attacks or acts of sabotage.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont by Santiago </F>
Pedraglio; place and date not given: "Belmont Speaks Out"] 
  [Text] [Pedraglio] You have stated that the executive 
branch is killing Lima, that never has so much harm been done to 
the city.... Do you reaffirm this view? 
  [Belmont] Yes, I reaffirm my statements. Taken out of 
context, their terms may sound very confrontational; but within 
the context of an explanation, each has its logic. 
  [Pedraglio] Do you believe that without funds of its own 
Lima's municipality can carry out projects by simply 
coordinating with the district authorities, as the central 
government representatives asserted in rationalizing DL 776? 
  [Belmont] According to the government representatives, 
something that has been working rather well--and the proof is 
that I was elected to continue carrying out works projects--does 
not work. They say that it is not technical and that it is not 
fair because it does not distribute the benefits equitably...and 
they pull a figure out of a hat, wave it, then clam up. They 
practically issue the order to dynamite Lima. It is, as I term 
it, the biggest of all attempts, one that nobody can justify. 
And now, everyone has grown silent. They accuse me of pursuing 
electoral ends. But no one can defend stripping a municipal 
administration's budget of 44,887,900 soles, by a mere stroke of 
the pen. 
  [Pedraglio] That is a reduction from 64 million soles to 19 
million, as I read it. 
  [Belmont] In one round. And from 144,359,000 for the 
Invermet 
project I have been slashed to 17 million, also in one round. 
Half of that 144 million was to have been invested in new urban 
settlements. 
  [Pedraglio] Why do you think Fujimori supported your 
candidacy a year ago? 
  [Belmont] Fujimori did not support me. Fujimori had a 
candidate named Pablo Gutierrez. When the results of the polls 
were submitted to Fujimori--the same polls also rated me--Pablo 
Gutierrez was summoned to the Government House and told, "You 
must withdraw." Pablo Gutierrez asked, "Why?" And the answer 
was, "Because you are going to lose." The Administration had 
decided to pull its candidate out of the race so as to not be on 
the losing side. It had begun comparing the views of the two 
contenders. Those views obviously gave it the answer it was 
seeking, a week or 10 days in advance, as to which of the two 
was likely to win. 
  [Pedraglio] Do you believe that the executive branch's 
behavior--including that of the president, of course--is owing 
to its viewing you as a potential adversary in the 1996 
presidential elections? 
  [Belmont] That is plain as day to the taxi drivers, the 
household help in the homes I visit, the civil construction 
workers...and even to the kids. They are all aware that Fujimori 
is jealous of anyone who could overshadow him. In Lima, he never 
got more than 26 percent of the vote, and in each of two 
elections I have scored 48 percent. 
  [Pedraglio] The government has said that the bulk of 
available funding has heretofore been centralized in Lima to the 
detriment of the rest of the country's municipalities, and that 
its intent is to decentralize those funds so as to benefit the 
small districts, the little urban centers. What is your view of 
this argument? 
  [Belmont] I have already said, on one occasion--laughing at 
that attitude--that this was the national dirty-tricks 
government, the leg-puller of all of us Peruvians who have seen 
history unfurl before us and who have lived it and taken part in 
it. 
  Lima's municipality is not a rich one. It is a very poor 
one. 
Its budget is one twentieth that of Bogota. As a candidate, 
Pablo Gutierrez said, "If I am elected mayor, I shall have money 
to provide water, electricity, and sewers, and to finish the 
Santa Anita market, and I shall complete more construction 
projects than all the other previous mayors together." One can 
legitimately wonder whether, had he won, the government would 
have acted in the same way. 
  [Pedraglio] Do you regret having taken a favorable position 
on 5 April toward Fujimori's decision to dissolve Parliament, 
and toward everything else he did? 
  [Belmont] I must again point out that memories are very 
faulty. I issued a statement approved by Lima's Metropolitan 
Council in which I deplored the break with the constitutional 
order and earnestly hoped for its early restoration. But 
interviews taking on a political turn, as they sometimes do, the 
next question was, "What do you think of Parliament?" I answered 
that Parliament was a disaster, good for nothing, in the 
belief--shared by thousands of Peruvians--that a democratic 
Parliament would be created within the shortest possible time, 
that would be much closer to the people, more austere, and more 
dynamic. That is what I urged. 
  And this I will admit: I believed in the good faith of the 
government. I understood the government's position because I 
have my own municipal parliament to deal with. And as it is 
designed, the city's "executive branch," the mayor, is unable to 
function unless he is backed by a majority and a consensus. The 
city retrogressed badly during my initial term, because of the 
considerable resistance I encountered in the "municipal 
parliament." I could see that I, too, would have welcomed a 
change in the municipal parliamentary structure; but, as written 
and published in all the newspapers of 23 April 1992, I was 
never in agreement with the break away from the constitutional 
order. 
  But I did believe in President Fujimori. I acknowledge that. 
I saw in him a man who was acting pragmatically in areas in 
which I would have done the same. 
  [Pedraglio] In which areas, for example? 
  [Belmont] In that of social reinsertion, in 
privatization--but not in the way he has now done it. That way 
is not the most elegant, to say the least. 
  [Pedraglio] At what point were you no longer convinced of 
the 
government's orientation? At what point did you say "this is not 
working?" 
  [Belmont] When he won his second election. Because I noted 
that the government became very touchy about my very high 
standing in the polls. The government was already cooking up his 
reelection, but I did not know that. No one knew it. 
  Then they started talking about a new Constitution. I did 
not 
lean toward a yes. Instead, I published a very harsh commentary 
that leaned toward a no. I maintained an impartial position as a 
mayor, but from a municipal viewpoint, I pointed out the reasons 
that put all local governments at risk. It was at that point 
that I realized the danger of the octopus. 
  [Pedraglio] You had a critical opinion of the previous 
Parliament. Do you believe that the present one is better? 
  [Belmont] No. It is worse. That is why I am frustrated. This 
is a Parliament designed to have Fujimori reelected, so that he 
can push through the laws he chooses to. It is simply a 
Parliament of puppets. The opposition is painted on the walls. 
And I feel that I was mistaken in putting too much faith in the 
people. 
  [Pedraglio] Do you think Fujimori is going to easily 
relinquish power in 1995? 
  [Belmont] No. It is going to be very difficult. It has been 
very well thought out. One who intends to run a clean election, 
as president, answers the questions asked by the press. But he 
does not mock, he does not go around acting like an adolescent, 
he does not delegate whatever is not to his advantage, he does 
not inaugurate things, day after day, that are beneath the 
dignity of a president.... There is only one player on the 
stage. In my view, the drug of power has converted him into an 
addict who has no intention of abjuring what I call the morphine 
of power. 
  [Pedraglio] You have said that you are not going to run for 
office. In sports terms: Is this a feint or for real? 
  [Belmont] No, no, no. This is for real. I do not intend to 
stand. But I do intend to remain in my role as the elected mayor 
and defend the municipal charter to the bitter end. 
  It is only since I became a potential candidate that I have 
had all these problems. Between 1990 and 1993, the president 
lauded my works projects. He consistently complimented me. He 
would ask me, "How do you do it, Ricardo?" He would accompany me 
to view them. But at the most recent project inauguration, to 
which I invited him--and, I might say, his name has figured on 
all the dedication plaques; I was not interested in having my 
name figure on them--I noted in his gaze that he was already 
seeking a candidate for Lima. 
  He had told me on many occasions that he saw no other 
candidate who could compete with me, with so many public works. 
But a month and a half before elections, he telephoned me at 
home to give me orders, to tell me that I must rescind some 
specified taxes because he was not in agreement with them. I 
replied: "Mr. President, I am the mayor. I am grateful for your 
suggestion, but leave it to me to decide." He did not like that, 
and in one blow he annulled one of the vehicle taxes I was about 
to announce. At that point I realized that the president wanted 
to govern Lima. 
  Subsequently, I submitted the bill of a new organic law of 
municipalities to him that would enable Lima to operate under 
the next mayor to be elected. At that time, it was not my 
intention to stand, but I did feel that whoever did stand should 
have the easements that I did not have. He received the bill, 
thanked me for it, and in the end I believe he must have said to 
himself, "I am going to implement this plan without Belmont." I 
thanked him for his frankness.... 
  [Pedraglio] Why? 
  [Belmont] He suggested to me that I withdraw, that I not run 
for election. I had told him, "Mr. President, I am an 
independent...." 
  [Pedraglio] When did that happen? 
  [Belmont] About two months before the elections; more or 
less 
in November 1992. He was very courteous to me in this regard. 
But he already wanted to control all areas. 
  [Pedraglio] When you spoke of supporting an independent 
candidate, did you have in mind Perez de Cuellar? 
  [Belmont] He is the man who could beat the president, on the 
basis of a very precisely detailed governing platform that would 
deliver what it promised. 
  [Pedraglio] What would you consider the basic lines of a 
government platform? 
  [Belmont] First, an economic program. One cannot promise to 
deliver an antishock economy and proceed to deliver a shock 
instead, an economy that has forgotten the mass sectors and has 
made the rich richer and the poor poorer. The program would all 
have to be studied by a team of economists, in order to tell the 
Peruvians, the many unemployed and the many underemployed, that 
from the day the next party takes office, the rules of the game 
will be these, and will not change. 
  The platform would also provide that whoever takes office as 
head of the government and fails to keep his or her word will 
fare as the presidents of other countries do. They must resign 
immediately for having lied to the people. A president's lie in 
the Middle East, and in the United States as well, entails his 
immediate resignation. Here, instead, presidents, members of 
Parliament, politicians, lie, but they complain when a political 
group commits an act--which I do not justify-in the face of 
powerlessness stemming from so many lies. The liars themselves 
are the root cause of such occurrences, because they have lied 
so much. That is all there is to it. 
  [Pedraglio] Of the independents, today, Perez de Cuellar 
appears to be the best positioned, objectively speaking. 
  [Belmont] Basically, I do not believe in polls. 
  [Pedraglio] Thus, I could not infer that if you were to 
support an independent capable of beating Fujimori, Perez de 
Cuellar would be your best choice as of today. 
  [Belmont] Perez de Cuellar is one of this country's highly 
eminent assets. Peru would immediately gain international 
respect and that of all the Peruvians, for what he represents. 
But I would not be part of the ticket, nor would I accept a 
position in the government. On the contrary, I would announce my 
retirement from Peruvian politics. That says it all. 
  [Pedraglio] But could you, as you have stated it, support 
him? 
  [Belmont] I would support the ideas posited by Mario Vargas 
Llosa, as I did in his time. I have been frank enough to say, 
"Gentlemen, if I were president I would do what Vargas Llosa has 
said he will accomplish." He had an emergency social platform, 
he was initiating a serious privatization process, he was 
opening the economy to a free-market one.... That platform was 
supported by three master beams which I applauded. 
  What we Peruvians need at this stage is to agree on a master 
plan. But I would like for the person who assumes responsibility 
for its implementation, as the representative of those 
majorities--and I do not want to be that person; I sincerely 
believe that I am not cut out for these things; I have given six 
years of my life to public service and I now want to return to 
my own work, my business affairs, my personal life, for strictly 
family reasons--but I would like that person to be one of known 
qualifications, not a new arrival, appearing from one day to the 
next with rabbits under his hat, inventing government along the 
way. I would like that person to be one who is prepared to 
accept a serious commitment to the country and to the solution 
of the problems that we all see and that have not been resolved 
for the past many years. 
  And the person best meeting these conditions is Perez de 
Cuellar, because of his record. I would like to see him 
representing Peru so as to bring dirty-tricks government to an 
end. 
  [Pedraglio] It is said that you are trapped by the Channel 
11 
thing, and that if you were to run for election, your opponents 
would bring out some things.... 
  [Belmont] Then, let them bring them out once and for all. 
There is no dirt. On the contrary, I have proven to be an 
entrepreneur who builds his enterprise on the basis of human 
capital, with a broad stockholder base in which 70,000 persons 
participate, who invests all of his money in fixed assets that 
today are enabling Channel 11 to transmit and compete 
head-on--not as a monopoly--with the television monsters, which 
have lost much more money than Channel 11 has lost. On the 
contrary, the government should reward me for having survived 
two crises: that of Alan Garcia and that of Fujimori, with its 
brutal recession that has forced the sale of one of the biggest 
television enterprises, Channel 4, to the Mexicans, because 
Channel 4 could no longer survive. Channel 11, on the other 
hand, with all its faults and mistakes, has made no profit, but 
it is solid as a rock because it owes nothing to anyone, and 
because its economic base is entirely shipshape. 
  [Pedraglio] Is the enterprise's relationship with that broad 
base of shareholders really operative? 
  [Belmont] Of course it is. We hold stockholders meetings. We 
hold them publicly. The problem is that in this country, success 
is prohibited. Channel 11 is always present on the screen. It 
has never gone dark in its seven years on the air. Moreover, I 
would not have been elected if I were a swindler, a man who had 
defrauded his contingency. I have 70,000 partners, and if we 
multiply each family by five... If I have won the elections that 
I have, it is because my partners voted for me, as did others 
who were not partners, of course. Furthermore, I am certain that 
if I issue a new block of shares in Channel 11, the number of my 
partners will exceed 1 million. 
  [Pedraglio] What is the basis of the suit that you have 
announced will be brought by the municipality against the 
government? 
  [Belmont] My lawyers are looking into it. It is the first 
case of this type, in which government sues government. 
Generally speaking, throughout history, the government has been 
a great ally of the mayor. My team of lawyers, accredited by the 
Lima Bar Association, is presently studying the legal aspects of 
the action.
