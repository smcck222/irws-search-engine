<F P=106> ["Exclusive article" by Jorge Child, economist, journalist, </F>
columnist for various Colombian publications, and PRENSA LATINA 
collaborator: "Recipes for the Fight Against Inflation"] 
  [Text] The recipes for fighting inflation are very simple: 
a policy on income or the control of demand. The first recipe 
is known as unorthodox stabilization and the second as the 
orthodox policy of the IMF. 
  If demand alone is restricted, the economy's unemployment 
rate rises and investments which support agricultural production 
levels and small manufacturers are reduced. On the other hand, 
if prices and salaries are frozen -- in keeping with the 
unorthodox plan -- and demand is not controlled, inflation will 
quickly increase as occurred during the Cruzado Plan (in 
Brazil), which aimed at zero inflation in 1986. 
  The decision was made not to devalue the currency because 
the 
exchange rate was considered real and there was a trade surplus. 
This trend continued through 1986 before the Cruzado Plan was 
implemented. 
  During the first few weeks of the program, businesses became 
more efficient, chose their products well, and increased 
productivity, but the tenets of the plan did not prove true: the 
trade surplus did not continue and the balanced budget that was 
relied upon was abandoned; salary increases returned, and the 
loss of competitiveness because of a fixed exchange rate halted 
investment growth. 
  In Argentina, the Austral Plan was the answer to a prolonged 
period of high inflation rates due to uncontrolled government 
spending. This plan consisted in a freeze on prices, public 
spending, and salaries, that is, the unorthodox plan. 
  Its failure was due to the unfreezing of prices that must be 
implemented during periods of economic recession and when the 
fiscal deficit has been reduced; otherwise inflationary 
pressures will be triggered again due to government spending and 
the upsetting of relative prices. 
  Argentine President Carlos Menem's current plan, based on 
the 
orthodox plan of controlling demand, has been successful thus 
far because of the income received from the substantial 
privatization of government-owned businesses. The fixed 
exchange rate, in line with the U.S. dollar, has supplied the 
consumer market with imported goods but has not resulted in a 
parallel flow of exports. 
  The Menem plan has been partially implemented in the Mexican 
experience. This plan is known as the Stability, 
Competitiveness and Employment Pact (PECE), and its emphasis is 
on reducing transfers abroad that occur because of an overvalued 
exchange rate and reduced government spending. 
  During the first phase the restrictive credit policy was 
used 
to complement budget adjustments and the currency exchange 
policy. Like in the Menem plan, privatization has contributed to 
fiscal resources without inflationary pressures. 
  The relative success of these orthodox anti-inflationary 
strategies in Argentina and Mexico are due to the fact that they 
were implemented during a period of relative stagnation, during 
which unemployment has played an important role as a 
deflationary mechanism. 
  The Colombian experience with the orthodox strategy 
implemented by Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has not had the 
same success because of the inert components of the generalized 
system of adjusting interest and salary rates. Simultaneously, 
uncontrolled spending on public security has been inevitable due 
to the high level of violence in Colombia which, according to 
the National Department of Planning, has reached a world-record 
77 murders per 100,000 residents, followed by Brazil, in a 
distant second place with 24 murders per 100,000 residents. 
  The exchange rate as an instrument for making the economy 
competitive on real international levels does not work if we do 
not keep salary trends in mind. This happened to the Chilean 
economy in the 1980's, with a reulsting high social cost. 
  According to Rudiger Dornbush, in the preface to his book 
"Fighting Inflation" (Editorial Grijalbo 1993), the combination 
of orthodox and unorthodox plans requires conviction and a 
minimum sustained effort so that after brief moderate successes 
the inflationary spiral will not be recur. If not, the current 
decade's illusion of monetary stability will mirror the 
frustration of the previous decade.

  [Text] Havana, 16 May (PL) -- The Cuban union movement 
today began holding assembly proceedings to seek alternatives 
and solutions for attaining increased production in the work 
centers. 
  The weekly TRABAJADORES in today's edition makes a special 
appeal to the workers of the country, urging them to strive for 
economic efficiency in meetings which, according to the 
newspaper "must not be formal gatherings but genuine collective 
gatherings." 
  We appeal to the workers, especially to the worker class, to 
come with their sleeves rolled up, to search for measures which 
today, in the harsh conditions of the special period, will 
determine in each work center the need to improve order, 
discipline, attention to the worker, more efficient use of 
scarce resources, and increased production and quality, the 
paper states. 
  Considering it the most important task of the Cuban worker 
movement, the editorial urges the leaders of the Cuban Workers 
Federation (CTC) and its members to commit themselves to the 
success of the process which -- it insists -- must serve to take 
action on essential aspects of our economy and society.

  [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Amid the island's economic 
crisis, Cubans are looking for practical solutions to their most 
pressing problems, a subject that will be broached today in 
neighborhood assemblies in Havana. 
  Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National Assembly of 
the 
People's Government (parliament), told National Television's 
channel six that all officials who have any responsibility 
whatsoever in the social development process must attend the 
neighborhood assemblies. 
  Crombet said that "we do not want monologues or useless 
meetings" and added that the meetings to discuss daily problems 
will be attended by everyone from representatives of 
administrative organizations in each neighborhood to directors 
of schools, hospitals, clinics, and stores. 
  He admitted that things are not working the same everywhere, 
thus the government must place greater emphasis on the big 
cities to handle difficulties expeditiously. 
  The first assembly of District 40, located in the Havana 
municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, was held today. 
Initiatives were proposed at the meeting to improve the 
community. 
  District Deputy Mario Rios commented on his experience at 
the 
assembly and said he presented problems to the community so 
solutions could be found collectively.

<F P=106> [Article by PRENSA LATINA correspondent Jorge Gomez Barata: </F>
"Cuban Emigrants: A Plea for Magda"] 
  [Text] The broadcast of some videos of the reception that 
followed the closing ceremony of The Nation and the Emigrants 
Conference, which President Fidel Castro attended, has served as 
a pretext for a wave of verbal lynchings of some conference 
participants, especially Magda Montiel David, a young lawyer. 
  The wrath against Madga and the lack of scruples it reveals 
are evidence of the counterrevolution's control over Miami 
media; a control that gives it considerable power to manipulate 
public opinion in that city. 
  Based on a few minutes during which Magda Montiel 
fraternized 
with Fidel, a caricature has been created to portray her as a 
meek, pliant person who simply came to Havana to participate in 
a scheme carefully crafted by the revolution. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
  On the contrary, it was the seemingly fragile Magda Montiel 
who raised the most delicate and sensitive issue during the 
conference when she asked about the death penalty by firing 
squad -- a penalty meted out by the courts for extreme crimes. 
This penalty took on political connotations after the victory 
of the revolution, when it was imposed on those who had 
committed war crimes and torture at the service of the Fulgencio 
Batista dictatorship. 
  If any of her detractors had held the conversation Montiel 
held with Fidel Castro, that person would be considered a hero 
in Miami. It seems that what bothers them the most is not what 
Magda did but what they are unable to do. 
  Montiel did not receive an answer to her question because 
her 
issue was not on the agenda and because of a desire to avoid 
controversial issues that could detract from the event's main 
objective. Nevertheless, when Castro met her at the reception, 
with his natural honesty, he brought up the issue. 
  Fidel Castro: "You are Magda? I heard you speaking this 
morning, but you did not receive an answer. No one gave you an 
explanation about the firing squads. You do not know that story 
well." 
  Magda Montiel: "No, but someday you are going to have to 
tell 
it to me." 
  Fidel Castro: "I will tell it to you now." 
  Magda Montiel: "I want to tell you something, Fidel. Thank 
you for what you have done for my people. For me, you have been 
a great teacher." 
  Magda uttered words that inquisitors to the right of 
Torquemada consider blasphemous: She thanked Fidel for "what 
you have done for my people," an expression that in the context 
of the occasion could be considered a simple courtesy -- void of 
any commitment -- while addressing someone who is not only a 
head of state but a historically renowned figure. 
  Magda did not take sides nor did she express an opinion. Not 
even Cuba's most rabid enemies deny Fidel's role in the advances 
made by the Cuban people, nor is calling him a teacher unusual. 
  What is curious about this situation is that the substance 
of 
the conversation between Fidel and Magda is being minimized 
while the unimportant details are being blown out of proportion. 
  Although it was done cautiously and respectfully, to have 
brought up the issue of the firing squads during the conference 
does not make Magda Montiel any more agreeable to me, nor does 
it move me to praise her. If I had a choice, I would have 
preferred that she not bring up the topic, but the fact of the 
matter is she did. 
  In my opinion, what we are really dealing with is an attack 
on an entire generation of Cuban-Americans, in the person of 
Magda Montiel, who -- because they are not committed to the 
militant counterrevolution and do not share their elders' 
reservations about the revolution but have a different style and 
modern outlook on politics -- reach reasonable albeit critical 
conclusions about the national situation and are accepted as 
valid interlocutors. Jorge Mas Canosa and Armando Perez Roura 
feel more envy than hatred. 
  The young sector has made a convincing debut in this 
conference. They have the opportunity to be heard in Cuba and to 
be a decisive factor among the emigrants. Havana is not trying 
to saw the floor out from under the counterrevolution; the 
counterrevolution is scurrying to prop up the ruins. 
  By insulting Magda Montiel the reactionaries are 
accomplishing several objectives. They are trying to discredit 
the conference and settle old political accounts, but most of 
all they are availing themselves of the opportunity to try to 
discredit their potentially most effective rivals who, to tell 
the truth, are not in Cuba but in Miami. 
  I met Magda during the conference. I was impressed by her 
simplicity, open spirit, and unselfishness. She is a happy, 
successful, and fulfilled person. She is not gaining anything 
nor seeking anything for herself; on the contrary, she seems 
like a missionary dedicated to serving the community where she 
lives. 
  I trust that in this brazen exhibition of sterile and 
primitive rage by adversaries who have not respected the privacy 
of her home nor the innocence of her children, Magda and her 
family will find new reasons to persevere.

  [Text] Havana, 16 May (PL) -- Representatives of 
cooperatives and the country's most productive peasants began a 
meeting here today to exchange experiences and to commemorate 
the 35th anniversary of the agrarian reform law. 
  Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of 
Small Farmers of Cuba, said in a speech at the Orlando Pantoja 
Agriculture-Livestock Cadres School in the outskirts of the 
capital that the main topics to be discussed are quality and 
increased production in agriculture. 
  Fonte noted that those attending the meeting will take note 
of a report, experiences in which limitations in fertilizers, 
pesticides, and other raw materials to obtain good harvests have 
been overcome, reported on by the national Radio Reloj station. 
  Those present make up the most productive sectors of Cuba in 
key areas that obtain convertible foreign exchange, such as 
sugarcane, citrus fruits, and coffee. 
  The meeting was chaired by Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, 
member 
of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba; Alfredo Jordan, 
minister of agriculture; and Nelson Torres, sugar industry 
minister. 
  The agrarian reform was promulgated on 17 May 1959 by the 
foremost leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, during a 
ceremony held in the Sierra Maestra, the principal range of 
mountains from where he lead the war of national liberation. 
  The law modified the farm production structure, determining 
that areas encompassing over 400 hectares would become state 
patrimony and turning over land to thousands of bereft peasants.

  [Text] Asuncion ROMPRES 18/5/1994 -- Paraguay's capital 
Asuncion is the last stage of the South-American journey of 
Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and his delegation, a 
stage that started on 18 May afternoon. The Romanian premier 
was welcomed at the airport by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. 
The visit started with an interview between the Romanian 
premier and the Paraguayan president. Virtually, there is no 
tradition of Romanian-Paraguayan relations. Diplomatic 
relations were established only in 1992. The Romanian party 
considers that actions should be started soon, to secure a 
development of these relations. Priorities are the realization 
of adequate diplomatic representation in the two capitals, the 
conclusion of the first inter-government agreements, the 
development of trade. 
  The Paraguayan party has already shown interest in the 
domain 
of economic cooperation, in the building of a Romanian car 
assembly line, the building of cotton spinning mills, of 
electricity transport lines, oil and mining units. Trade and 
economic cooperation agreements and an agreement on mutual 
promotion and protection of investments are expected to be 
signed during Premier Vacaroiu's visit.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/5/1994 -- Several cooperation 
agreements were signed on Monday [16 May] between Romania and 
Peru occasioned by the visit paid by Romanian Prime Minister 
Nicolae Vacaroiu, currently on a Latin American tour. 
  Viewed by Premier Vacaroiu as the most significant, the 
agreement on trade and economic cooperation (signed by Minister 
of Trade Cristian Ionescu, on behalf of Romania, and by Liliana 
Canale, the Peruvian minister of industries, tourism, 
integration and international trade negotiations) stipulates the 
principles for trade operations based on market economy rules. 
  The Romanian premier and his Peruvian counterpart Efrain 
Goldenberg, who is also Peru's foreign minister, sealed an 
agreement for investment mutual guarantee and protection. 
  The third document -- the collaboration agreement between 
the 
National Agricultural University "La Molina" in Peru and the 
Bucharest Agricultural University -- was signed by Education 
Minister Liviu Maior on Romania's behalf and by Jose Dance 
Caballero, rector of the Peruvian institution. 
  Also sealed were two understandings by an exchange of 
letters 
signed by the two countries' foreign ministers, one setting up a 
mechanism of consultation between the two ministers, and another 
for free diplomatic, special and service visas. 
  Before the signing ceremony, Romanian Premier Nicolae 
Vacaroiu and his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg (whose 
parents are Bessarabian natives), had an interview during which 
stress was laid on "the extremely fine ties" between Romania and 
Peru. 
  Also on Monday, another agreement was signed by Aurel 
Ghibutiu, president of Romania's Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, with the leadership of the National Confederation of 
Private Employers Institutions, which stipulates the setting up 
of a collaboration committee and envisages Peruvian economic 
missions to Romania.

<H5>  Text of Letter </H5>
<H8>  APPEAL </H8>
  COMRADES OF THE PERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY FIGHTERS OF THE 
PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY COMRADES AMONG THE MASSES 
  As communists, applying our specific ideology of Marxism, 
Leninism, Maoism, and the thoughts of Gonzalo and reflecting 
almost exclusively and intensely on these problems for the past 
year, we have reached the following conclusions in the 
preparation of a "concrete analysis of the concrete situation." 
  For more than 13 years, we have carried on a people's war as 
the greatest social movement in Peruvian history. As a result, 
Maoism has been defined as the third, new, and higher phase of 
Marxism. The prestige and impact of the party has been raised to 
the highest point. We have gained immense and mainly positive 
experience in the service of the World Proletarian Revolution. 
We have achieved this, like everything in life, through great 
and heroic efforts and have had our successes and failures. 
Nevertheless, we must look clearly and profoundly at the 
situation which we face at present and its foreseeable 
prospects. The facts show that the present government has made 
objective progress in carrying out its tasks, especially since 
the events of 5 April 1992, which clearly was necessary for the 
Peruvian state to do. Thus, it has established foundations for 
the economic process and has carried out adjustments in the 
state. And, what applies to us more directly, it has prepared a 
systematic, coherent, and well-developed strategy at different 
levels, particularly in the field of intelligence, achieving 
real successes, principally through the capture of cadres and 
leaders, among them myself. Clearly, this is the most important 
success achieved by the Peruvian state during the past 13 years 
of war. In this way it has favorably prepared the course which 
the present government is following. 
  Meanwhile, on our side real problems have been growing. New, 
complex, and very serious problems have arisen in world 
politics, in the situation in which the country finds itself, 
and in the war which is unfolding. All of these questions have 
raised fundamental leadership problems for the Peruvian 
Communist Party. Nevertheless, the party has been dealt its 
hardest blow in terms of its leadership. As proletarian 
revolutionaries we know very well and must keep in mind the fact 
that a people's war, starting from the realities facing it, 
requires certain, essential conditions to succeed. It needs 
proletarian leadership, a mass base, strategic centralization, a 
prolonged war, a new type of army, and a favorable international 
situation. It is clear that this last condition does not exist. 
However, the first condition is the principal one and from it 
flow the others. Therefore, a people's war is essentially a 
question of political leadership. The question of leadership is 
decisive. In our case this question cannot be resolved in a 
timely way. 
  Consequently, the facts show that the prospects facing the 
people's war are not its expansion but simply keeping it going. 
  On the basis of what has been said above and under the 
present circumstances, the party and principally its leadership 
are being faced with the need to make a new and great decision. 
In the past we carried on our struggle by beginning a people's 
war. Today, with equal firmness and determination we must fight 
for a peace agreement as an unavoidable, historic necessity. 
This also makes it necessary to suspend activities related to 
the people's war, except those involving self defense. There is 
a corresponding requirement that the Peruvian state suspend its 
military activities and not make reprisals of any class or kind. 
Once this previous question is resolved, we can proceed to 
drafting a Peace Agreement, whose implementation will lead to 
the end of the 13-year war which the country has been waging. 
These are historic decisions which the party must make now, 
particularly considering that peace has become a necessity for 
the people, the nation, and Peruvian society as a whole. Peace 
will serve to unite the people, for the people, notwithstanding 
the differences among them, are united by a profound, common 
interest. 
  We are taking this extremely important step in carrying out 
our responsibilities. We are absolutely certain of the need for 
doing this, as communists, as maoists, and as soldiers of the 
proletariat, even committing ourselves to serve as one of the 
parties guaranteeing the implementation of the peace agreement. 
  We call on all party comrades, and particularly on its 
cadres 
and leaders, on the fighters, on the masses, and principally on 
the left wing of the party who seek, in close union with us, to 
hold high and to apply this new, just, and correct decision. It 
relates to the position of the proletariat and to the interests 
of the working class and the people. 
  22 September 1993 
  PRESIDENT GONZALO 
  On Friday afternoon, 8 April, a videocassette and the 
typewritten text of a document reached the editorial offices of 
SI. According to those who sent it, this was the third letter of 
Abimael Guzman Reynoso. This was the letter whose public 
distribution was announced by President Alberto Fujimori on 
several occasions shortly before the referendum of 31 October 
1993. However, this letter was never published and nothing 
further was said about it. 
  Some six months later in April 1994, sources identified as 
relatives of Shining Path personnel held in prison sent to 
certain publications, including SI, a document which, they 
state, is a true copy of the third letter of Abimael Guzman 
Reynoso. 
  The document, together with a video recording in which two 
hooded Shining Path members appear reading it, presents some 
problems in terms of timing. The document is dated 22 September 
1993, or prior to the date of the second letter (6 October 
1993). As this is a typewritten document, there may have been a 
typographic error. The first letter was dated 15 September 1993. 
As far as the rest of the third letter is concerned, the 
contents appear to be genuine. 
  If the letter is genuine, it would confirm that, in effect, 
when the president let slip a remark concerning the possibility 
that there was a third letter from the leader of Shining Path, 
this letter had already been written. 
  President Fujimori's clear objective at that time was to 
make 
the point that Abimael Guzman sent this third letter, not to 
him, but rather to the Shining Path forces. He wanted the leader 
of the subversives specifically to admit in the letter that he 
had surrendered and to call on his followers to lay down their 
arms. 
  As indicated from a reading of the letter, this third 
communication from Abimael Guzman, which has now been made 
public, did not include those conditions and did not satisfy the 
demands of the president. 
  One of the Shining Path family members said: "Therefore, 
President Fujimori did not agree with it." 
  And, therefore, the president and the National Intelligence 
Service (SIN) simply filed the letter. 
<H5>  Summary of the Contents </H5>
  In the third letter from Abimael Guzman the following, basic 
ideas are contained: 

  -  It reaffirms and provides a basis for his proposal for a 
peace agreement. 
  -  It reaffirms his Marxist, Leninist, Maoist 
ideology. 
  -  It seeks to vindicate the role played by 13 years of a 
people's war. 
  -  It recognizes that the government has made 
progress since 5 April 1992, particularly in the fight against 
subversion. 
  -  It points out serious problems on the world 
scene. 
  -  It describes the problem of proletarian leadership as 
decisive. 
  -  It calls the proposed peace agreement a great decision 
and a national need. 
  -  It confirms the fact that the Shining Path 
movement is wholly committed to the search for a peace 
agreement. 


    It says nothing, however, about the Shining Path 
surrendering 
and laying down its arms. 
  A Shining Path spokesman states that conversations with the 
government have been broken off. It is known that they were cut 
off after the referendum of 31 October 1993. The spokesman added 
that the "representatives" of the Shining Path leadership who 
were sent to the leaders in prison have returned to the original 
places where they were being held. 
  The Shining Path spokesman said: "The government is going to 
continue to do everything possible to prevent a peace agreement 
from being drafted. A peace agreement does not suit its 
interests. The idea was used for election purposes. We see it as 
a necessity, however, not only for us, but for the country." 
  Everything seems to indicate that, after contacting its 
leaders in prison, the supporters of Abimael Guzman in Shining 
Path have gone out into the streets. Outside the walls of the 
prisons the most stubborn and recalcitrant elements of Shining 
Path, who reject the idea of a peace agreement, control most of 
the organization. The Metropolitan Committee of Shining Path [in 
Lima] holds a contrary view, as do the higher leadership bodies, 
which are effectively controlled by Comrade "Feliciano." 
  Family members of those in prison, trade union officials, or 
isolated leaders outside the leadership bodies are distributing 
the peace proposal. According to our Shining Path informant, 
they are finding a positive reception, particularly among the 
rank and file members who have participated directly in the war. 
The "intellectuals" are most opposed to a peace agreement. We 
asked if this term refers to Shining Path members in the 
universities. We were told, "Yes." 
  The Shining Path cadre seems to have a clear understanding 
of 
their position. 
  He admitted: "The boss has been captured. The rest are easy 
meat. The organization right now is like a boat without a 
rudder. And to resume an active life again, there has to be 
another person, equal to or more capable than the leader who is 
in prison, to take over this responsibility." (He was referring 
to "President Gonzalo.") 
  A family member who spoke in the metaphoric language of a 
Shining Path cadre stated: "The waters have to be constantly in 
motion. If they quiet down, everything falls apart. We have to 
expand, but now we are just keeping up the present level of 
activity." He concluded: "The war has to be ended, because now 
it leads nowhere." 
  Despite the fact that President Fujimori does not show the 
same interest in a peace agreement as he did before the 
referendum of 31 October 1993, fighting for this proposal (which 
is too general) is a new contradiction which Shining Path is 
discussing.

  [Text] Uruguayan Agriculture Minister Pedro Saravia has 
said it is necessary to prevent the surfacing of new forms of 
protectionism. He made this remark while opening a meeting of 
the so-called Cairns Group, made up of 14 countries exporting 
unsubsidized agricultural products. The discussions will be 
held until tomorrow at the ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association] headquarters in Montevideo. Following are Dr. Pedro 
Saravia's remarks: 
  [Begin Saravia recording] The negligible reductions in 
export subsidies make us believe that this practice, which 
particularly misrepresents the trade of agricultural and 
livestock products, will continue limiting the development 
possibilities of agriculture in our countries, at least the 
mid-term development possibilities. 
  In our opinion, it is clear that the Cairns Group did not 
achieve all the goals set when it was established. 
Nevertheless, based on the fact that we did not fully achieve 
our goals, it is necessary for the group to continue operating 
in the pursuit of a freer and fairer international trade in 
agricultural and livestock products. 
  Bearing this goal in mind, the group must remain alert and 
active in order to secure full compliance with Article 20 of the 
agricultural agreement on the pursuit of the reform process. We 
must add the necessity of strengthening the advancements 
achieved thus far to this mid-term necessity of substantially 
reducing agricultural protectionism and subsidies. 
  Therefore, we now believe the Cairns Group must play an 
active role in monitoring compliance with the commitments 
entered during the Uruguay Round, in keeping alive the issue of 
agricultural trade on the international agenda, and preventing 
the surfacing of new forms of protectionism. 
  Dear colleagues, we understand that the Cairns Group played 
an important role during the Uruguay Round, served national 
interests, and in the future it must continue playing such a 
significant role -- as it has been playing so far -- for the 
benefit of the member states and the multilateral regulation of 
agricultural trade. [end recording] 
  These were the words of Agriculture Minister Pedro Saravia.

  [Text] The Panamanian foreign ministry has dismissed a 
deputy's charges that the Cuban Government intervened in the 
electoral campaign to favor the opposition, the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD], which won the 8 May elections. A week 
before the elections, Leo Gonzalez, a deputy from the 
Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement, presented a series of 
documents to the Panamanian foreign ministry allegedly revealing 
that the Cuban Government had provided support and technical 
advice to Ernesto Perez' electoral campaign, which will put the 
PRD at the helm of the nation on 1 September. 
  The foreign ministry reached the conclusion that the 
documents are a forgery; it therefore closed the investigation 
and dismissed the information revealed by the deputy. 
  Miguel Martinez, Cuban charge d'affaires in Panama, said he 
had affirmed from the beginning that the documents were forged 
and that he was confident that the Panamanian foreign ministry 
would handle the issue carefully.

  [Text] The sessions on money hoarders began today in Havana 
Province. In the meeting of Combatants of the Revolution, 
details on the application of Decree-Law No. 149 were announced. 
  (Pedro Saenz), second secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC] in Havana Province, announced that a provincial 
group, as well as four sub-groups in different parts of the 
province, have been created. Each one of these groups is headed 
by a prosecutor. He also advised that [words indistinct] 
municipal command posts for the practical support to this 
decree-law. In the meeting with combatants of Havana, some 
expressed concern over effectiveness and justice in the 
application of this decree, whether, as a combatant from Jaruco 
said, they would not continue mocking the Revolution. 
Nevertheless, Candido Palmero, first secretary of the PCC in 
Havana, stressed that the work is being done seriously and 
meticulously. 
  [Begin Palmero recording] In other words, we will do things 
so that they cannot move. By then, some will have hidden the 
motorcycles, others will have reported them stolen, and others 
will have hidden the cars. [end recording] 
  He added that emphasis will be placed on those who have 
gotten rich on state resources, and that money hoarders would 
not have too many opportunities to cheat or make changes to 
their advantage. He insisted that it was about joint action. 
  [Begin Palmero recording] I do not think they will have too 
many chances. This has become a task of the people, of the 
revolutionary people. In other words, there must be justice in 
this process. We need to be patient because we are not going to 
do things in a disorganized manner. We will do things little by 
little. 
  I just received a note about someone in a municipality who 
has a rice combine, two tractors, a (Moscovi) car, a (William), 
a motorcycle, and a truck. According to sources, he has eight 
cars [chuckles] and a great sum of money. By now, he must be 
pulling his hair out. There is no hurry. That law is not for a 
few months only; that law is here to stay. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 18 May carries the program Straight Talk 
featuring Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE and Eloy 
Concepcion of TRABAJADORES. The program focuses on the current 
degree of autonomy of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, or 
UBPC's. 
  Rodriguez notes that autonomy is a much debated issue at the 
UBPC's, adding: "The enterprise often acts as if the UBPC were 
its subordinate, and the UBPC often acts as if it were indeed a 
subordinate of the enterprise." 
  Concepcion says: "First, let us say that the word autonomy 
scares a lot of people in the enterprises, as well as comrades 
in the UBPC's." Concepcion adds that current Ministry of 
Agriculture structures have yet to match changes in policy 
regarding farming during the special period. 
  Regarding the role of the state, Concepcion adds: "Right 
now, 
the state cannot let individuals produce whatever they want, 
whenever they choose, and distribute whatever they wish to 
whomever they wish." 
  The speakers discuss the example of a UBPC that was ordered 
by the enterprise to plant yams, although it was not 
yam-planting season. This resulted in a lackluster crop, and the 
Cuban people ended up the losers. Concepcion says the enterprise 
should set a production plan for the UBPC in keeping with the 
government's interests, adding: "The enterprise should leave a 
large enough margin so that the UBPC can decide in what season 
and under what conditions crops are to be planted. The 
bureaucracy refuses to give up the power it possesses and that 
often, consciously or unconsciously, blocks the progress of the 
Revolution." Concepcion says there is conflict between the 
Ministry of Agriculture's enterprise system and the UBPC's on 
how to tackle food production problems. He stresses: "We have 
tried many formulas: cooperatives, large state enterprises. At 
the beginning of the Revolution, we had cooperatives, people's 
farms, etc., and the UBPC's are our last chance. Everyone must 
contribute to their success, since we are dealing with a most 
important issue: feeding the population." 
  Rodriguez notes that frequently the bad is stressed, but, he 
asks, what about the good? Concepcion replies: "Not all the 
fault lies on the side of the enterprise system; there are 
comrades managing UBPC's who are also at fault." 
  Concepcion says that highly positive results have been 
obtained by the UBPC's since their creation five and a half 
months ago and that he honestly believes that, within a year, 
the UBPC's will become self-sufficient in food. 
  The speakers then discuss the fact that the work force is 
better distributed in the UBPC's. Nevertheless, more workers are 
needed throughout Cuba for agricultural activities. Concepcion 
says: "We are a country unable to produce yams and cassava. We 
have thousands of caballerias overgrown with weeds and we blame 
the problem on a lack of fuel and fertilizer. What we lack, to 
solve the food supply problem of the municipalities and the 
population, is self-respect. What we lack is self-respect and 
agricultural know-how. That is my opinion." 
  Rodriguez reiterates that Cuban agriculture needs additional 
workers and notes that Cuba's alleged worker surplus could be 
assigned to agriculture. In this connection, Concepcion adds: 
"There is an accord, soon to be a year old, from the Politburo 
that states that the Ministry of Agriculture is to give small 
plots of fallow land to retirees. Why has the Ministry of 
Agriculture not given these people this land? Why the delay? 
This was a Politburo accord. It would have meant more food for 
the population." 
  Rodriguez concludes: "Once more bureaucracy is acting 
against 
something as important as the UBPC's. Like you, however, I 
believe this process is continuing to make progress, and that 
the UBPC's will be a success."

<F P=106> [Report by Luis Vasquez Merino from the "Early Morning" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] There was violence in San Luis Potosi yesterday. 
Thirteen urban transportation buses were burned and 10 cars 
destroyed when autonomous University of San Luis Potosi students 
clashed with bus owners and gang members. 
  The incident started in the morning when the students, led 
by 
their leader (Ramon Puron Cir), seized about 20 public 
transportation buses and kept them inside the university campus 
to protest the large number of people killed by buses and the 
humiliating treatment afforded users. 
  The bus owners, accompanied by gang members, stoned 
buildings 
and cars owned by professors and burned a car. The students 
responded by burning 10 [figure as heard] of the seized buses. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Our stand is to hold 
talks and do our best to ensure that they pay for the damage, 
which is quite considerable. Things like this should not happen 
at a university. [end recording] 
  All this transpired as public forces watched from a nearby 
street but did not intervene, arguing that they could not 
violate university autonomy. 
  The Red Cross treated at least 12 people, most with minor 
head injuries. Governor Horacio Sanchez Unzueta, who marked his 
first year in office yesterday, said the violence was provoked 
by people not affiliated with the university. He added that 
this incident will be fully investigated and those responsible 
will face the full force of the law.

  [Text] The changes at the Attorney General's Office [PGR] 
are linked to the results of the struggle against drug 
trafficking. Of the four attorney generals who have left their 
post, three have fallen into disgrace. They were fired for 
their inability to fight drug trafficking and only one of them, 
Jorge Carpizo McGregor, obtained positive results. This served 
to promote him to a higher position: government secretary. 
  In a PGR analysis of the administrations of the four 
attorney 
generals this institution has had and is expected of the fifth 
appointed in this six-year administration, it is noted that 
Carpizo McGregor was the one who achieved the greatest control 
of the PGR. He controlled "up to 35 percent," the remainder (65 
percent) was controlled by the large drug trafficking 
organizations and the territories they managed. 
  Of the other three attorney generals, Enrique Alvarez del 
Castillo was considered the most negligent. He never established 
any type of control of the PGR. During his administration, the 
drug cartels appointed and removed government officials. During 
Ignacio Morales Lechuga's administration, up to 15 percent was 
under his control, although he was forced to resign when that 
control dropped to 5 percent. 
  During Carpizo's administration, control of the PGR rose to 
35 percent, while during Diego Valades' administration, control 
was lost once again as he surrounded himself with officials who 
had "dubious" backgrounds. The percentage of control fell to 10. 
  Humberto Benitez Trevino, the fifth attorney general, to a 
certain extent has been appointed to direct blows against drug 
trafficking, but his main concern is the electoral problems and 
the crimes that may arise. 
<H5>  First Attorney General </H5>
  1 December 1988 to 21 May 1991. 
  Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, former Jalisco governor, was 
appointed attorney general by President Carlos Salinas. He took 
over the post on 1 December 1988. 
  Without any control of the PGR, Alvarez del Castillo 
delegated the PGR's main duties to Javier Coello Trejo, who he 
appointed deputy attorney general in charge of combating drug 
trafficking. According to the PGR analysis, Coello Trejo gave 
support to cartel "A" in Tamaulipas led by Juan Garcia Abrego 
which competed with cartel "B" in the Pacific, led by Armando 
Carrillo Fuentes. In addition to the above, Coello Trejo and 
his police officers acted with impunity. The cases of rapes and 
kidnappings of women in which his officers were involved damaged 
even further his image. 
  From 1989 to 1990, the drug-trafficking heyday continued 
until the murder of Norma Corona, the president of the Human 
Rights Commission of Sinaloa, on 21 May 1990. Citizens' 
pressure forced Salinas to organize a National Commission for 
Human Rights (CNDH). 
  Salinas placed Jorge Carpizo, former president of the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico, at the helm of the 
CNDH. Salinas was forced to give total support to Carpizo. 
This in turn resulted in the fall of Alvarez del Castillo, who 
had lost control of the PGR, and Coello Trejo on 21 May 1991. 
<H5>  Second Attorney General </H5>
  22 May 1991 to 4 January 1993. 
  Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the new attorney general, appointed 
Jorge Carrillo Olea to replace Coello Trejo. He was not 
appointed as deputy attorney general, however, but as 
coordinator in the struggle against drug trafficking. The new 
coordinator's struggle against drug trafficking took off until 
it confronted Hector Palma, alias "El Guero," who was engaged in 
a struggle with capo Miguel Felix. This resulted in a shoot out 
and a massacre among drug traffickers in Sinaloa and Tijuana, 
territories controlled by these gangs. 
  At the same time, a confrontation took place between "El 
Chapo" Guzman and the Arrellano Felix gang when the former 
entered the heroin market in addition to stealing three cocaine 
shipments from the Arellano Felix gang. 
  During Morales Lechuga's administration attempts were 
initiated to reduce capo Garcia Abrego's influence in the PGR, 
given that in the previous administration under Alvarez del 
Castillo, Garcia Abrego designated deputy district attorneys, 
delegates to the states, and distributed large sums of money. 
  Although during Morales Lechuga's administration there was 
an 
attempt to reduce the drug cartels' influence, Garcia Abrego 
influenced PGR decisions at the highest levels, Arellano Felix 
at the mid-level, and Amado Carrillo at the lower level. 

<H5>    Third Prosecutor </H5>
  5 January 1993 to 10 January 1994 
  When Jorge Carpizo initiated his administration at the PGR, 
he left Carrillo Olea at the forefront of the struggle against 
drugs. Nevertheless, from day one it was noted that Carpizo 
would not follow in the steps of Ignacio Morales. He started by 
taking control of his office and learning the PGR reality, which 
he began to control. 
  "With Carpizo at the helm, none of the PGR officials budged, 
they all walked a straight line -- at least that was the 
appearance. At any time, a special investigation group could 
surprise them and if any irregularity was uncovered they lost 
their jobs or they ended up in jail. This instilled fear in 
many of the officials," remarked one of the sources consulted. 
  Everything went well for Carpizo until 1 January 1994 when 
the insurrection took place in Chiapas. Beginning in January, a 
"witch hunt and repression" was initiated in all the nation's 
police institutions as a result of this armed conflict. 
  At that time, from the Center of National Security at the 
Government Secretariat, Fernandez de Villar attempted to involve 
Carpizo in this "witch hunt and repression." The attorney 
general, however, cleverly pointed out that the PGR had nothing 
to do with the Chiapas conflict, therefore, it was not its 
responsibility. 
<H5>  Fourth Attorney General </H5>
  11 January 1994 to 13 May 1994 
  Diego Valades, who came from the Federal District 
Prosecutor's Office, came to the PGR with the mission and with 
the same line of conduct as Carpizo. Nevertheless, Valades' 
problem was that he sought political posts with greater 
responsibility such as Queretaro Governor or a seat on the 
Supreme Court of Justice. This took up his time as well as much 
of the push Carpizo gave to the PGR. The PGR began to fall by 
the way side. 
  Valades appointed to his work team deputy attorney generals 
who were publicly questioned for being corrupt such as Rene 
Gonzalez de la Vega and Alfonso Cabrera. Moreover, he made 
important changes in PGR representatives at several 
institutions; this allowed drug trafficking to blossom. 
  In addition to this, Valades made a mistake when he 
attempted 
to present new charges against Mario Aburto, Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murderer, for "false testimony." Aburto had never 
declared he was telling the truth before any judicial authority. 
Valdes also made a mistake by fighting the National Action 
Party team that governs Baja California, while he conducted 
operations and made statements that placed the PGR's legality in 
doubt. 
  This attorney general felt a great deal of pressure and 
anger, first because a Special Prosecutor's Office was not 
created for the Colosio case, and second for the creation of the 
National Public Security Coordinator, headed by Arsenio Farell. 
<H5>  Fifth Prosecutor </H5>
  14 May 1994 to ? 
  Humberto Benitez Trevino took over the post of attorney 
general on Saturday. His main challenge is not the struggle 
against drug trafficking, rather it will be to combat electoral 
crimes.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 17 May, Televisa Coahuila 
correspondent Juan Andres Martinez reported on "The Awakening 
Program" hosted by Guillermo Ortega that judicial agents protect 
drug traffickers in the city of Saltillo. As a result of this 
report, Martinez was arrested. 
  At the office of Judicial Police Commander Mario Espinoza 
Lobato, Martinez was accused of committing a serious offense by 
tarnishing the image of the Attorney General's Office, PGR, with 
his report. The Televisa correspondent was arrested without an a 
warrant. He was held incommunicado for nearly nine hours and 
was transferred to the Saltillo Prison, where he remained until 
this afternoon. This occurred after he broadcast a report which 
the PGR station in Coahuila did not like. They are now saying 
that he committed other offenses. We find this very strange, 
however. We are asking that the abuses against correspondent 
Juan Andres Martinez be dealt with in accordance with the law.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Alfredo Cristiani with </F>
unidentified reporters on 17 May; place not given; from the "YSU 
Radio News" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Cristiani] As long as compliance with parts of the 
peace agreements is pending, and because Onusal [UN Observers 
for El Salvador] is in charge of verifying compliance; it is 
only logical that it continue its work until the process is 
over, gradually reducing its activities in the final phase, as 
the UN secretary general has said. We believe the extension is 
normal in view of pending matters such as public security, the 
PNC [National Civilian Police], and the land transfer process, 
which will continue after 31 May. I believe the extension is 
necessary. 
  [Reporter] We understand that the Onusal head will hold a 
high-level meeting on public security this week with the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] and the government. 
What specific public security issues will be discussed? Has 
that meeting taken place? 
  [Cristiani] No, no, there has been no meeting. A 
preparatory process in under way to discuss preliminary issues. 
The most difficult points are discussed at the highest level. 
We are trying to redesign the PNC deployment --at least that is 
the government's position -- to avoid the vacuum of authority 
that could result from expediting one aspect of a joint process; 
that is, the deployment of one force and the demobilization of 
another. This was originally planned one way, so we must try to 
modify the plan so the next government [words indistinct] the 
deployment would take place differently. The objective is to 
provide security for citizens. 
  [Reporter] How are the kidnapping investigations going, 
particularly in the western region? 
  [Cristiani] The kidnappings have not been just in the 
western 
region. Recently three [words indistinct] have been involved in 
this type of activity in the eastern region, and there have also 
been cases in other parts of the country. The western region 
has been the most affected recently. We hope to continue [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Yesterday [word indistinct] said this could 
affect 
the financial [words indistinct]. Our country is reportedly 
among those which represent the highest risk for investors. 
  [Cristiani] We are not among the countries with the highest 
investment risks. We are no longer in that category. We are 
now among countries where investment is not so risky. This is a 
problem of common crime that is not unique to El Salvador. 
Crime is a problem everywhere. We could say it is worse in 
Guatemala, and even Costa Rica is facing serious crime problems. 
The modus operandi of these extortions and kidnappings indicate 
that it is not a band of criminals specializing in such crimes 
but common criminals who think it is easy to blackmail a family 
by asking for large sums of money in exchange for the release of 
one of its members. I believe that as we increase the number of 
PNC agents, we will be able to fight crime more efficiently. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] involved in kidnappings? 
  [Cristiani] There have been two cases. 
  [Reporter] The UN secretary general said international aid 
is vital to the consolidation of the peace process. Do you 
agree that international aid is fundamental to the process in 
respect to public security and land transfers? 
  [Cristiani] It is fundamental in the sense that the country 
lacks funds. Those programs can be implemented more quickly and 
without problems when the international community supports them. 
As for the land transfers, we think we have the necessary funds 
to complete that program. The PNC is responsible for public 
security, therefore the state is willing to continue providing 
the necessary funds for a public security body that meets our 
needs. 
  [Reporter] Would you say that those who gave financial 
support to El Salvador [word indistinct] have abandoned the 
country in peacetime ? 
  [Cristiani] I would not say that. Each country has its own 
problems. New needs are arising in the world so resources must 
be shared. East Europe, which has given up communism and is 
trying promote development, has received a great deal of support 
from industrialized nations.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 19 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Official 
sources reported today that Guatemalan state security forces 
defused nine explosive devices that guerrillas had planted in 
several places throughout the capital city as well as in the 
countryside. 
  Police found two fragmentation grenades and guerrilla 
propaganda in the community of Molino de las Flores, south of 
Guatemala City. The guerrilla propaganda demands that the 
government and the Armed Forces honor the global agreements on 
respect for human rights. 
  Six other explosives were uncovered in the southern sector 
of 
the city, including three RPG-7 rocket launchers. 
  In addition, a Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) 
propaganda bomb was defused in Chichicastenango, in the 
northwestern part of Quiche Department. 
  According to the National Police, approximately 50 explosive 
devices have been defused so far in 1994.

  [Text] On 17 May, President Ramiro De Leon Carpio 
threatened to suspend the return of Guatemalan refugees from 
Mexico, according to the laws that apply to all Guatemalans if 
the leaders of the Permanent Commission for Refugees [CCPP] 
continue to violate agreements and defy authorities. 
  If they choose to return to the areas where armed clashes 
are 
taking place, the Army must be there, and that is why it is 
impossible to accept their petitions to withdraw the Army. In 
addition, this is not contained within the agreement. If they 
do not heed the established legal order, the return of refugees 
will be suspended, De Leon categorically stated. 
  De Leon noted that he is not willing to accept 
responsibility 
for the refugees' security despite his obligation as 
representative of national unity and the state to seek to 
maintain the security and peace of Guatemalans. 
  It so happens, however, that they are coming with 
improprieties, demands, and lies because they begin doing this 
once they reach Guatemala, in addition to manipulating the 
people. Two or three leaders are manipulating the rest of the 
refugees, who only want to come and work their lands, and this 
is why we must be firm. Either they comply or we suspend their 
return, De Leon pointed out. 
  De Leon said that on the afternoon of 15 May, Mauricio 
Rodriguez, dirctor of the Special Commission for Assistance to 
Repatriated People, asked him for authorization to suspend the 
return, which he agreed to do in light of the official's 
judgment and devotion. 
  He went on to explain that the intransigence displayed by 
the 
CCPP leaders is regrettable and disappointing because behind it 
all there is an entire process by the mediating group, of which 
he was a member. The mediation and the support groups 
established the mechanisms and stages. 
  De Leon argued that attitudes like those of the said 
leaders, 
who even risk the lives of the refugees, show that this 
manipulation exists and those who have been close and know in 
advance the movements and the elements involved in the return 
operation find it undeniable. 
  De Leon reiterated that all Guatemalans abroad, in 
accordance 
with the Constitution and government guarantee, are entitled to 
return any time. This is also true in light of the agreements 
signed in August 1992 and January 1993. 
  The government is willing to continue with mass and 
voluntary 
returns, but only if the conditions set are respected. They 
cannot claim they will organize their own civilian authority, De 
Leon concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares by </F>
"Democracy '94" program host Hugo Enrique Famania at the RPC 
Television studios in Panama City; date not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Famania] Mr. Perez Balladares, good evening and 
thank you for being with us. 
  [Perez Balladares] My pleasure. Good evening to all. 
  [Famania] Mr. Perez Balladares, 106 days have elapsed since 
you came to "Democracy '94" and we reviewed your campaign 
promises. On that occasion you said there were firms interested 
in fulfilling some of your plans; for example, the David-Paso 
Canoas expressway, the Panama-Colon expressway, the 
Chorrera-Capira expressway. How have these firms reacted to 
your victory? 
  [Perez Balladares] They are preparing to come here. We 
started contacting them the day our victory was proclaimed and 
we are still doing it. There are Mexican firms, some U.S. 
firms, and a Spanish firm. They are preparing to come to Panama 
to talk about the projects, especially the Panama-Colon 
expressway, which is the one that interests us most. 
  [Famania] When do you think you might begin these projects, 
which will become the employment solutions you also promised to 
give? 
  [Perez Balladares] The ideal time would be during the dry 
months of 1995, meaning January. Of course we must first wait 
for 1 September [chuckles] and then get the entire government 
interested in this topic, the public works minister and everyone 
concerned. The final designs must be prepared. We think they 
could be done quickly, probably in three months. Then we would 
start working during the dry months, January and February 1995. 
  [Famania] Some phrases have resurfaced following your 8 May 
victory. The one about a shower of money for the ruling party 
reminds us of the PRD's [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
populism. What will you do to change the perception that even 
PRD members have about your government? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think it is obvious that times are 
different from what they were during the 1970's when I 
participated and during the last years of the military 
government, which was not a PRD government. Now all Panamanians 
face a problem: the actual management of the Panama Canal as of 
31 December 1999. Obviously, this will not be my duty, but I am 
certainly responsible for preparing everything. As I said 
during the campaign, we must have the best men and women in the 
government and at decisionmaking levels, regardless of politics. 
We must set aside party views. 
  I have always said I would try my best to achieve a 
government based on a concerted effort, consensus, and national 
unity, and I am doing it, even though I am not president yet. I 
am simply the president-elect who is forming a government team 
which, thanks to the democratic transition, is becoming fully 
acquainted with Panama's problems. We will carry out our plans 
with programs we can all share, using national unity to face the 
challenges ahead of us. 
  [Famania] Could exchanging the PRD's populist image for 
another policy erode the party's popularity? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, because it is not a conceptual 
change. Our party and our government will continue to focus on 
resolving the problems of the humblest, neediest people. We 
cannot think that it will be done as easily as in the past, when 
we had the funds to finance social programs. We know it will be 
more difficult now, but with a certain degree of intelligence 
and some ingenuity, we will manage to do it. Our party will 
continue to be a party of consultation and dialogue, a party 
that talks with the people, a party that brings solutions to the 
communities. 
  [Famania] What will happen after 1 September? Will people 
who sought asylum in other countries return? 
  [Perez Balladares] I also said during the political campaign 
-- and this is another promise I will keep, as I will keep all 
the promises I made -- that we do not want any Panamanians in 
exile for any reason. Any Panamanian against whom criminal 
charges have been filed, however, must face those charges. We 
do not intend to pardon anyone or authorize anyone's entrance or 
departure. On the other hand, we do not want to put anyone in 
jail. Panamanians who currently face charges but manage to 
avoid being arrested through normal legal means according to 
Panamanian laws can return, if that is what they are worried 
about. 
  [Famania] Speaking of justice, when names were proposed for 
attorney general, several names were also proposed for Supreme 
Court of Justice magistrates. Does that mean there will be 
changes in the Supreme Court of Justice? 
  [Perez Balladares] I will respect the terms for which the 
magistrates were appointed, which was not the case in 1989. I 
understand, however, that those terms are about to end. 
Consequently, there will be replacements in the Supreme Court of 
Justice when those terms expire. There are candidates to 
replace those magistrates. 
  [Famania] What criteria will the government use to make 
those changes? 
  [Perez Balladares] The same criteria we have used for all 
the appointments: We will choose the best person available for 
the job. 
  [Famania] Some people have said the policy of rapprochement 
you are talking about means establishing a Torrijist government 
without any Torrijists in power. We will take a break and 
discuss this when we return. 
  [Famania] When we went off the air for commercials, we were 
saying that some people already say this policy of consensus is 
like a Torrijist government without Torrijists, and this entails 
a contradiction. What consistency...[pauses] How can you 
preside over a government with any consistency if some of its 
members do not support the PRD? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think you are mistaken if you believe 
that everyone who identifies himself as a Torrijist because he 
shares Torrijos' methods and doctrine must necessarily be a 
member of the PRD. That is not true. A great number of 
Panamanians -- twice the number of people in our party -- voted 
for our proposals, which are Torrijist proposals, and they are 
obviously not members of our party. Looking at history, I think 
one of the things that characterized Omar Torrijos' governments 
was precisely the fact that they did include people from 
different parties, from different places -- yet they were the 
best people to do the work that needed to be done at the time. 
  Obviously, as time goes by, as things are done together, you 
feel an identification that later becomes a party 
identification. In the beginning, none of us were members of 
any party. I say us because I was a minister during Torrijos' 
time, yet I had never been an active member of a political 
party. Others had been members of different parties, as 
different as the Liberal Party, the National Patriotic 
Coalition, which was its opponent, and the Communist Party of 
Panama. In other words, what occurred was an integration of 
wills from different political currents. That is the Torrijos 
method. 
  [Famania] During the electoral campaign, people who were 
standard bearers of the last phase of the military government 
were mentioned as possible members of your government. 
Rigoberto Paredes, Lucho Gomez, and others were mentioned. You 
know them better than we do. To what extent will these people 
be members of your government team? 
  [Perez Balladares] Well, you have seen my appointees. 
Unfortunately, many of these people were, in my opinion, 
demonized. In other words, they were stigmatized. Many of them 
made mistakes, and others did not. They, however, bear that 
stigma. I think that they are valuable men and women, but, 
unfortunately, it is not very easy to integrate them into 
government posts with that stigma. 
  [Famania] You spoke of professionalizing the police and said 
Oswaldo Fernandez should remain in his post. How have party 
members who once belonged to the military apparatus reacted to 
that decision? 
  [Perez Balladares] Famania, I have not done anything I did 
not mention ahead of time. I am doing what I said I would do 
because I did not lie to the Panamanian people. I said we would 
form a professional police force, and I will do just that. I 
said the professional police force will be headed by a civilian 
and will be under the command of a civilian. I think Mr. 
Fernandez has done a good job. I do not want to create any 
instability in the police force during a change of government 
that will make some people apprehensive. That is why I asked 
Mr. Fernandez to remain as police chief. I am keeping my 
promises. 
  [Famania] I asked you this question because on this program, 
"Democracy '94," many politicians who opposed you said, and I 
quote: We are not afraid of El Toro, but of the herd of cattle 
behind him. End quote. 
  [Perez Balladares] [laughs] I have always said that there 
are 
157,000 members in my party, and 99.9 percent of them are good, 
decent men and women. Under no circumstances should all party 
members be stigmatized for the good or bad actions -- in this 
case bad -- of a small few, that is, 10 to 15 people. 
  I also said my commitment to democracy is not just external 
but internal. There is internal democracy in my party. 
Consequently, I cannot set myself up as supreme judge and tell a 
person: You cannot be a member of my party because you have a 
bad reputation, a reputation that has not even been proven. 
  What I can do is utilize or not utilize a person in my 
government. I said at that time that I was more concerned about 
people who were around several candidates, people who had been 
chosen by those candidates. I saw in them a high degree of 
instability, a failure to inspire a feeling of security. Thank 
God they did not win. 
  [Famania] How have political groups that were your 
opponents reacted when you asked them to participate in your 
government? 
  [Perez Balladares] I have to be very honest. I sincerely 
believe that a majority of Panamanians realize that the 
electoral campaign is over. That beautiful page of the final 
campaign months and of 8 May, the day of civic performance that 
is a source of pride for all of us, has been turned. The 
Electoral Tribunal has done its part, as has the Vote-Counting 
Board. Now we are moving on to five years of work to make 
Panama a better country. I think many of our adversaries have 
this spirit. 
  When the Electoral Tribunal opens the election process in 
1999, we will again put on the t-shirts and caps of the various 
parties, but between now and then, let us all work together for 
Panama. 
  [Famania] How do you reconcile this good reaction you have 
mentioned with the fact that some political parties do not want 
to participate in your government? 
  [Perez Balladares] I respect that position. In democracy, 
there must be parties that want to remain out of the government. 
I am happy, though, that Carlos Sousa, the designated 
agricultural development minister, accepted his appointment even 
at the cost of resigning from his party, something that was 
difficult to do. 
  I understand that he see this commitment as being above 
party 
commitments. Many other people see it that way. The cabinet is 
integrating a group of people who are independent; that is, 
people who do not belong to any active political party. 
  [Famania] Some people believe a government of this nature is 
dangerous because the government, the government policymaker, 
may try to demonstrate that people of a certain affiliation are 
not the best people for the job, then these people would say 
that other parties are not any good either, or the members of 
other parties may try to sabotage the government. Are you 
afraid this might happen? 
  [Perez Balladares] Hugo, I am assembling what you could 
think 
of as an orchestra. I have looked for the best violinist, the 
best drummer, the best percussionist, the best people. It 
depends on me to make the band sound good or bad. I am the 
director of that orchestra. The government will do well or 
poorly depending on me. I am the president-elect. 
  [Famania] A few seconds ago you mentioned the election 
process we went through a few days ago. Magistrates have a 
definite term. The period of one of the magistrates expires in 
1998. 
  [Perez Balladares] Electoral Tribunal magistrates? 
  [Famania] Yes, the Electoral Tribunal. What will happen to 
that magistrate? 
  [Perez Balladares] On the day the Electoral Tribunal 
magistrates declared the election results, I said I viewed the 
three Electoral Tribunal magistrates to be outstanding men of 
the nation. They have done an extraordinary job. I also said, 
not knowing when their terms expire, that I hope they will stay. 
I also want to give greater independence to the Electoral 
Tribunal through constitutional changes, which is what is 
required, and I think that we can achieve this soon. I think we 
can do it soon. Right now, I do not hesitate to ask the 
magistrate whose period expires in 1998 -- according to what you 
have told me -- to stay. 
  [Famania] Right. Will your party agree to that? 
  [Perez Balladares] If this is a proposal I have to make, 
then 
I will make it, not the party. 
  [Famania] You have spoken about giving more independence to 
the Electoral Tribunal through constitutional changes. There 
are three ways to change the Constitution. Which would you use? 
  [Perez Balladares] The least traumatic one: approval by this 
Legislative Assembly of the constitutional changes we are 
planning to introduce and ratification by the new Legislative 
Assembly, which has already been elected and will take office on 
1 September. 
  [Famania] In addition to greater autonomy for the Tribunal, 
what other .... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] The definition of the role 
of the national police law is a very important topic for us, and 
we cannot work on it until we implement changes to remove the 
constitutional duties that still belong to an institution 
formerly called the National Guard. In the next two weeks, we 
will try to negotiate a consensus among the various political 
forces in the National Legislative Assembly. After we reach a 
consensus, we will discuss granting the Electoral Tribunal 
greater autonomy -- which I believe is crucial -- and reforming 
the Constitution to draft the future police law. Creating a 
human rights ombudsman's office is a third reform that I 
consider vital and hope to see implemented. 
  [Famania] If a proposal is made in the Legislative Assembly 
to broaden these reforms, it may lead us to a situation similar 
to that faced in 1992. Are you afraid of failing? 
  [Perez Balladares] Indeed, I am afraid. That is why I insist 
we must work with the various political forces in the Assembly 
so it will approve the three reforms and the next legislature 
will ratify them. 
  [Famania] How will these constitutional reforms be presented 
through the commission.... 
  [Perez Balladares, interrupting] The only way we can do it 
is 
with the approval of the president and the current government, 
who are the ones who have the legislative initiative to do it. 
To do it in a different way, a Legislative Assembly initiative, 
is more difficult. I invite President Endara to talk about this 
topic soon so that we can implement it. 
  [Famania] Mr. Perez Balladares' proposals include the 
reinstatement of public employees who were dismissed, if they 
wish to be reinstated. We will talk about that topic and some 
others during this program, "Democracy '94." 
  [Three-minute break for commercials] 
  [Femania] We are back with "Democracy '94." This is our 
17th and last in a series of programs during which we have 
discussed Panama's political situation. Today we are closing 
this program with the president-elect. During the commercials, 
we discussed the case of the employees who were dismissed. 
Before that, I forgot to mention something important about the 
elections. The transition period lasts 114 days. An expert 
said that if the counting process was so short, a long 
transition period might be hard to bear. Why not modernize it 
by making it shorter? What do you think? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes, I think it could be a future reform. 
Right now it is already set and we must comply with the law. 
But yes, I believe that shortening it would be good for the 
next president-elect and the outgoing president as well. I 
agree with that. 
  [Famania] This expert mentioned more traumatic or difficult 
cases such as that in South Africa, where the transition period 
was only two weeks. 
  [Perez Balladares] That is so. Perhaps, a month or a month 
and a half would be better than the long period we have. 
  [Famania] Let us discuss those who were dismissed. Many of 
them were dismissed through a law. The only way to reinstate 
them would be with another law. What method would you use? 
  [Perez Balladares] In our party, we are working out a way to 
assess the cases of those who feel they were unjustly dismissed 
and want to work for the government again. This will be done on 
a case-by-case basis. There are some people who were unjustly 
dismissed but do not want to be reinstated. They are working in 
the private sector or have set up their own businesses and are 
very pleased with what they are doing. 
  Those who feel they were unjustly dismissed and want to 
return should know that we are going to evaluate each case. 
Then we will proceed administratively without resorting to a 
law because there is no need for a framework law [ley marco]. A 
framework was established in the recent past. It did not 
dismiss name by name but established an alleged framework which 
the government used as a basis for dismissing a number of public 
employees. 
  We would proceed, administratively, to reinstate those who 
were unjustly dismissed -- it would have to be proven that they 
were, in fact, unjustly dismissed -- and who want to be 
reinstated. 
  [Famania] Do your public proposals, statements, and 
appointments have any effect on the transition team? I ask 
because we do not have much experience in this business of going 
from one government to another. We do not know how a transition 
team works. 
  [Perez Balladares] This is the first time in many years that 
we have had an orderly democratic transition. In fact, when 
there were honest, democratic elections a couple of times in the 
country's history, there was no transition period during which 
the two teams could interact. We are learning and perhaps we 
will make some mistakes, mistakes in good faith. There are very 
competent people on our side and on the side of President 
Endara, who wants this to be done in the least traumatic way. 
He wants the new officials to use this time to familiarize 
themselves with the issues the current officials are coping with 
in their ministries and autonomous institutions. Of course, I 
repeat what I said before: President Endara will continue to be 
in command as he has always been, as he is right now, and as he 
will be until 1 September. His ministers will continue to be in 
charge and his officials will continue to be responsible for 
their jobs. 
  This is not just a transition period but a learning period. 
It is a time to learn about the matters that require action 
from the state. 
  [Famania] How is the communication flow? To what degree is 
there tolerance? Have there been any situations where the 
current government has said something like: This is a state 
secret and we cannot discuss it. 
  [Perez Balladares] So far we have not been denied any 
information. We have been denied nothing. I think there has 
been a great desire for cooperation. 
  [Famania] Let us talk about international relations. You 
mentioned two visits abroad. On 20 May, you will go to Costa 
Rica and on 25 May to Colombia. What countries will follow? 
What will you propose during your visits? What is the reason 
for these visits? 
  [Perez Balladares] I am visiting our two neighbors to 
exchange views on common problems with Costa Rica and Colombia. 
That is why I am visiting those countries first. In mid-June, 
I plan to visit eastern countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South 
Korea, because I believe these countries see tangible 
possibilities of investing in import industries in the Canal 
area. 
  I want to take this opportunity to make the trip at my own 
expense, by the way. I do not want anyone thinking that I am 
using state funds. [laughs] 
  [Famania] That was my next question. [laughter] 
  [Perez Balladares] I will use my own money and make this 
trip now because I think it will be very difficult for me to 
leave the country later. There are too many things that need to 
be done. I want to take 15 days for that trip. 
  I will probably visit the EC sometime after 15 July. 
Europeans have a month vacation period during their summer, 
July and August. We will have to decide when to take this trip. 
  I also plan to go to Washington. I have already been invited 
to hold a number of meetings with the U.S. Government. 
  [Famania] Have you received any direct message from the U.S. 
President? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes. I received a congratulatory letter 
from President Clinton in which he talked about this topic and 
other matters of mutual interest. 
  [Famania] You said you will visit the EC. There is a 
pending banana problem with the EC countries. Are you going to 
present a proposal in line with your policy? 
  [Perez Balladares] We must include the Panamanian banana 
issue within the GATT agreements. We cannot be asked to be open 
when doors are being closed to our exports. Consequently, this 
is a topic we want to include in our talks with the EC, 
particularly with our friends the Spaniards, who can better help 
us solve this problem. 
  [Famania] We are discussing foreign policy. What will be 
the nature of Panama's relations with Cuba under your 
administration? 
  [Perez Balladares] We must maintain such relations under 
conditions that are equal to those we maintain with the rest of 
the countries of the world -- without more consideration or less 
consideration. We have interests in many countries; Cuba is one 
of them. It is not the one in which we have the most or the 
fewest interests. Thus, I think that we must maintain friendly 
relations, based on mutual respect, without our meddling, of 
course, in their domestic affairs or their meddling in ours. 
  [Famania] Many believe that our policy toward Cuba calls for 
special treatment because it is a country subject to a blockade 
that is yet to be the target of many decisions at the 
international level. What will Panama's attitude be in the face 
of this situation? 
  [Perez Balladares] It is worth noting that the blockade is a 
foreign policy of the U.S. Government. A great majority of 
countries in Latin America and the rest of the world do not have 
a blockade against Cuba; that is, they hold normal trade 
relations with it. I think that this issue must be settled 
between the United States and Cuba. 
  [Famania] Let us change the subject but continue with 
foreign policy. Let us discuss the Parlacen [Central American 
Parliament]. A few days ago, the law including Panama in this 
Central American multinational organization was approved in a 
third debate at the legislature. You said in your campaign, 
however, that Panama had more ties or it would be better for it 
to be linked to stronger blocs in South America or to join 
NAFTA. How do you harmonize this new law with your policy? 
  [Perez Balladares] We cannot ignore two facts: 
geographically, we are part of Central America, and politically, 
we have much affinity with the Central American countries. 
Historically, however, we have had more similarity with South 
America and economically, we have had greater affinity with 
NAFTA and South America. 
  Parlacen is a political mechanism. It is the Central 
American Parliament. I think we can join the Parlacen without 
it being a contradiction to our possible direct integration into 
NAFTA. 
  [Famania] There are people who are saying that the fact 
Panamanian parliamentarians would join organizations such as the 
Parlacen only mean that some Panamanians would be benefited with 
certain privileges. What do you think? 
  [Perez Balladares] That is being narrow-minded. That is not 
seeing the need to have a forum for political discussions. That 
is what it is. It is a forum for the exchange of objectives 
that could be subregional -- Central American, in this case. I 
think one should not think that way. 
  [Famania] Luis Ochoa Teran, the Venezuelan ambassador to 
Panama, said that after the 8 May elections, Panama earned, by 
its own right, its reintegration into groups such as the Rio 
Group, for example. With regard to that, are there any efforts 
being made in that direction? 
  [Perez Balladares] We are going to work very hard so that we 
can again belong to a group that Panama founded -- a group that 
was once called the Contadora Group and which is now known as 
the Rio Group. It is also a forum of conversation and unity of 
Latin American policies in the face of world problems. 
  [Famania] There is another important factor: Panama's 
economic growth. How will your government maintain this growth? 
How will it maintain this level of economic growth and how will 
it transform it into social development? 
  [Perez Balladares] As an economist, the only way that I know 
economic growth can be changed into economic [as heard] 
development is through public investment programs, in other 
words, something all Panamanians will receive as part of a 
distribution of national wealth. Perhaps the aspect with the 
most positive impact within this public investment program is an 
improvement in the quality of education. We have devoted much 
time and effort to that aspect and we will devote even more time 
and effort to it. It is evident that we have discussed other 
matters such as infrastructure projects. For example, there is 
the Panama-Colon freeway, the ports, more roads to improve 
traffic circulation in Panama City. These are works to 
redistribute wealth; however, the ones that have the most social 
impact are basically education and health. 
  [Famania] One issue of much concern is freedom of 
expression. 
How will you harmonize the interest of the media as a business 
to establish itself and continue to work in Panama and the 
interest that some journalists could have to control this 
profession? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think the two issues must be separated. 
I think there should be full freedom of expression. Some 
actions I have taken prove this. During the campaign, I vowed 
to guarantee freedom of expression. I have been asking 
journalists I have met with, including some who have attacked 
me.... [pauses] I told them that I met with them to defend 
their right to attack me.... 
  [Famania interrupting] Including EL CAMALEON? [laughter] 
  [Perez Balladares] [laughter] Yes, EL CAMALEON. I do not 
think people come ahead of national interests. I believe 
journalists -- I asked them to do that -- should meet to jointly 
present a program, plan, or a bill to abolish the various 
existing regulations, laws, and decrees that in some way 
restrict freedom of expression. I think that they should be 
abolished in the broadest and quickest way. 
  We need to eliminate the discretionary rule that the 
executive branch applies through the Government and Justice 
Ministry because it is a threat to freedom of expression. 
  I also believe we must establish a more effective and faster 
mechanism so that the people who feel slandered can sue for 
compensation through a civil and not a criminal court. These 
two topics should be covered in a law. I also think there 
should be communication, dialogue, and negotiation, if needed, 
between media owners and news associations to establish laws to 
protect journalists. These laws could cover a broad area 
ranging from compulsory membership, if that is what you decide, 
to permitting a person to exercise this profession with 
guaranteed tenure in the media. 
  [Famania] Following the campaign and after the elections, 
there has been great communication between reporters and Ernesto 
Perez Balladares. 
  [Perez Balladares] It will continue, Hugo. 
  [Famania] I was heading in that direction. How will this 
vary? Will we continue to communicate? 
  [Perez Balladares] Always. 
  [Famania] It will be that simple? 
  [Perez Balladares] Mario Velasquez is the man whom we put in 
charge; he will be our spokesman from the Presidency. He will 
be our contact with the media. Boris Moreno is my private 
secretary. He will have my agenda but, in addition, he is a 
journalist. So you will have a way to contact me indirectly. I 
will always be willing and accessible. 
  [Famania] Aside from all the telephone numbers to find you, 
it will be so easy. 
  [Perez Balladares] In addition, I have not changed my home 
or 
office telephones and I will not change them. 
  [Famania] Businessmen say that one of your top challenges is 
to maintain political stability in Panama. What is your plan to 
accomplish this? 
  [Perez Balladares] Well, it is just what we have been 
achieving. I think that during these two weeks after the 
elections we have been creating this climate of tranquility and 
political stability. It caught my attention when I left the 
Atlapa Convention Center at dawn on Monday (9 May) -- well, it 
was not dawn anymore, it was 0700 -- and I saw people going to 
work normally. The campaign was over and we had entered a 
period of normalcy, a day of work and stability in Panama. I 
want to continue with this commitment and I will do everything I 
can to continue this normalcy. 
  [Famania] Can we trust we will have better or the same kind 
of elections in 1999? 
  [Perez Balladares] This is why I want to introduce, if 
possible, in agreement with all political forces and with 
President Endara, a constitutional reform giving greater 
independence to the Electoral Tribunal. This is a commitment I 
have. Perhaps some people still have doubts that I will do it. 
But there is no doubt I will do it. If we can include in the 
Constitution that the Electoral Tribunal will have total 
independence, then there will be no room for doubts that it is 
my interest to have those elections. 
  [Famania] This is something unusual. We will now give you a 
few seconds for you, without any questions on our part, to send 
a message to all Panamanians. 
  [Perez Balladares] I want to say I am very proud of the 
electoral process. I am proud of the way the Panamanian people 
participated, the high level of civic spirit they showed. I am 
proud we were able to have a civic campaign and that our 
government will be a reflection of the mandate we received. I 
cannot close without thanking this program because you were one 
of the biggest supporters of the electoral campaign. With great 
civic spirit, you allowed the candidates to express their views 
and the Panamanian people were able to make their choice freely. 
I thank you and this enterprise.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May. 
  Harmodio Arias, commerce and industry vice minister, 
announced yesterday that the Mexican Government decided not to 
accept Panama's latest offer for paying off this country's crude 
oil debt, which has been pending for the past five years. 
Despite the fact that an agreement was made, negotiations will 
continue, and it is expected that an understanding satisfactory 
to both parties will be reached shortly. Vice Minister Arias 
refrained from disclosing the details of Panama's offer but did 
say that the current administration would like to reach to an 
agreement before the new government is sworn in. Panama 
currently maintains a $120 million debt to Mexico for crude oil 
purchased within the framework of the San Jose Pact. This debt, 
which has been outstanding since before 1989, accumulates 
monthly interest totalling $800,000. (Panama City EL PANAMA 
AMERICA in Spanish 13 May 94 p 3A) 
  Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria disclosed that $145.3 
million in exemptions were approved during 1993 for duty-free 
imported goods, export incentives, exports of nontraditional 
goods, and taxpayers credits. Tax exemptions and customs rights 
for imports totalled $135.9 million, of which $124.1 million 
corresponds to the manufacturing sector. Exemptions within this 
sector represent 91.4 percent of total exemptions and are 
related to machinery, heavy equipment, spare parts, raw 
material, semi-processed goods, containers, and imported 
bearings. The Comptroller General indicated that, although the 
1993 figures are evidence of an 8.3 percent drop from the 1992 
level, "Panama still continues to be basically an exempt 
country." He believes that the practice should be amended in 
order to use these additional revenues in other government 
sectors. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 10 May 94 p 
B1)

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 May (NA) -- Union sources have 
reported that the CGT [General Confederation of Labor] has 
decided to criticize, before the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), adjustment policies that cause a "strong 
deterioration in the living condition of workers," but without 
making specific reference to the situation in Argentina. 
  The decision was made today, during a meeting at which the 
CGT analyzed the strategy the labor central will adopt at the 
ILO annual assembly, due to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 
June. 
  Analysis of the matter will continue tomorrow at 1000 during 
a meeting of the CGT national secretariat at the labor central's 
headquarters. The agenda will also include a review of the 
latest contacts with entrepreneurs and legislators in search for 
a consensus on labor laws, in-service accidents, and migration 
of foreign workers. 
  It was leaked that CGT Secretary General Antonio Cascia's 
speech to the ILO Assembly will seek to strengthen ILO policy, 
and will reiterate the objections the bloc of Latin American 
countries has raised before ILO authorities. 
  Cascia's speech, which has not yet been written, will focus 
on objections to neoliberal adjustment policies and their 
negative consequences for workers. In this regard, the sources 
said Cascia's speech "will maintain a low profile" in dealing 
with the Argentine workers' situation. 
  Latin American countries recently held a seminar in Buenos 
Aires on the "role of workers within the ILO," during which the 
international organization was asked to promote "the 
strengthening of workers' rights and the improvement of their 
working conditions." 
  The CGT will also demand the promotion of tripartite 
negotiations "to promote fair, equitable development," in line 
with the conclusions of the seminar, which Cascia will reiterate 
in his speech to the ILO Assembly. 
  Cascia will ask the ILO to begin an international campaign 
to 
approve a World Charter of Workers' Rights, including the rules 
referring to human rights." [no opening quotation marks as 
received] 
  The CGT meeting today was also attended by leader Alfredo 
Atanasof (municipal workers), Juan Jose Zanola (bank workers), 
Ramon Valle (insurance workers), Ramon Baldassini (FOECYT) 
[Federation of Postal and Telecommunication Workers], and Carlos 
Gdansky (UOM) [Metalworkers Union].

  [Text] La Paz, 10 May -- The ministers of foreign affairs 
and the government agree on the legalization of drugs. 
Responding to whether Bolivia will follow Colombia's lead with 
regard to the legalization of drug consumption, they stated on 
10 May that this issue cannot and should not be considered from 
a unilateral standpoint, but rather as a part of a general 
context. The government rejects this because it wants to 
prevent the country from becoming a "Mecca" for drug traffickers. 
  Both ministers seek to ward off the possibility that Bolivia 
will embark on a legalization process, since, as Government 
Minister German Quiroga pointed out, it would turn the country 
into a "Mecca for drug trafficking." 
  Quiroga said: "The trafficking issue must be assessed within 
a general perspective rather than individually, as a nation. It 
would be terribly dangerous if one country became the 
traffickers Mecca. This is why we must be part of a general 
approach, part of the measures adopted by all countries, both 
producers and consumers." 
  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar called the issue delicate 
and pointed out that it must be solved by the international 
community as a whole, as the community of nations is now 
debating this issue. 
  The government minister, who holds more radical ideas, 
voiced 
his firm opposition to the decriminalization of cocaine as 
Colombia proposed. He believes it would turn the country into 
the "Mecca" for the production, consumption, and peddling of 
psychotropic drugs and a place where drug kingpins would thrive. 
  Quiroga pointed out that the legalization of consumption 
should be part of a consensus process and policy among several 
countries. He added that it would be most inappropriate for 
Bolivia to make a unilateral decision. 
  He stated that Colombia's stance on this issue should be 
considered as "leaving one's opponent unmarked and making a 
false move," which may have appalling consequences for the Latin 
American country that may become the world's center of drug 
consumption and distribution. He added: "This is most 
dangerous." 
  Quiroga noted that one cannot favor the legalization of 
drugs 
on the premise that interdiction has allegedly failed since the 
two points are different, but at the same time, are constituent 
parts of a whole. Interdiction is a fundamental part that seeks 
to track and punish traffickers while crop substitution programs 
seek to devise economic solutions to solve the problem of 
surplus coca production. "The two paths should run parallel: 
Interdiction and crop substitution could otherwise run 
separately instead of being part of an overall policy," he said. 
  Quiroga said Bolivia should coordinate with other countries 
toward a coordinated action. The government minister remarked 
that the country has achieved very encouraging results in its 
struggle against trafficking, even though it did not eradicate 
all surplus coca plantations. He added that this subject is 
under discussion with U.S. authorities. 
  Quiroga contended that aid for the balance of payments 
should 
not be exclusively linked to the reduction of coca crops, but 
should also consider blows dealt to trafficking, the destruction 
of maceration pits, the dismantling of laboratories, and the 
number of drug gangs arrested. He said: "It is not just a 
question of destroying coca crops, it is a war against 
trafficking." Quiroga also denied any alleged pressure over the 
mandatory eradication of surplus plantations and a reduction in 
economic aid toward the balance of payments.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Vice President Victor Hugo </F>
Cardenas by FIDES NEWS AGENCY, ANF, in South Africa "after 
Nelson Mandela's inauguration"] 
  [Text] La Paz, 10 May (ANF) -- The victory of the struggle 
against a racial and segregationist policy that culminated in 
Nelson Mandela's inauguration as the first [as published] South 
African president is the strongest evidence that Bolivia and 
South Africa are building a multiethnic, multiracial, and 
multilingual democracy, strongly based on national unity and 
social wellbeing. 
  These remarks were made by Vice President Victor Hugo 
Cardenas during a telephone interview with FIDES NEWS AGENCY's 
central offices at Government House. The vice president is 
heading a national delegation in Cape Town. The mission 
participated in Nelson Mandela's inauguration together with 150 
other missions and nearly 5,000 world rulers and personalities. 
  "What we are doing in Bolivia, (the reforms), through much 
pain and sacrifice, is very important for the future. The 
entire world, not just Bolivia, is working to build 
multicultural democracies where different ethnic groups, 
cultures, and customs form part of the fabric of democracy," 
Cardenas said. 
  During his two-day visit to South Africa, Cardenas held 
short 
meetings with representatives of various countries. He met with 
U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Hilary Clinton. He also met 
with Cuban President Fidel Castro Ruz, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, 
and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize 
winner. 
  "The central issue of all dialogues with these important 
world leaders was the outcome of South African democracy and 
improving relations with that nation," the vice president 
explained. 
  "Bolivians must think very seriously about normalizing 
relations with South Africa and opening a Bolivian special 
mission in this country," Cardenas said, stressing the 
importance for Bolivia of the changes that are being experienced 
by one of the African continent's more powerful nations. 
  At 2000 (Bolivian time) on 18 May, Victor Hugo Cardenas will 
have "an exclusive meeting" with President Nelson Mandela to 
discuss issues relative to the democratic process and the ethnic 
factor in both nations. 
  Cardenas said there is full awareness that the change 
process 
in South Africa was very painful and full of sacrifice, "but 
there is also the fact that Bolivia can participate in the 
construction of a multiethnical and multicultural democracy, 
that this is no longer a dream." 
  Cardenas said some South African countries "are interested 
in 
details of the recent reforms introduced by Bolivia through laws 
on popular participation, capitalization, and education reform. 
They are very interested in the Bolivian case, a country where 
people from many ethnical backgrounds have integrated." 
  The vice president said that during his short meeting with 
Cuba's President Fidel Castro, the two leaders recalled the 
outstanding moments of the Cuban participation in Sanchez de 
Lozada's inauguration last August. "Castro again thanked the 
Bolivian people for their affection and warmth during his 
historic visit." 
  Cardenas said that during his meeting with Vice President Al 
Gore, the U.S. official said he felt gratitude and happiness 
over his visit to Bolivia last March. "The wife of the U.S. 
president, Hilary Clinton, told us that Mr. and Mrs. Gore are 
really happy, particularly after visiting Lake Titicaca and the 
adjacent settlements." 
  The vice president said: "Bolivia is remembered by these 
distinguished friends. They asked about the capitalization 
project, education reform, and people's participation." 
  "South Africa is building a multiethnic, multicultural, and 
multilingual democracy, just as Bolivia. These are common 
aspects from which Bolivians can learn a lot. We must be 
grateful because the process of change has not left as many 
victims in Bolivia as in South Africa where the wounds are still 
fresh," the vice president said.

  [Text] Bolivian businessmen have blocked the aspirations of 
the government and Chilean private business by deciding that a 
free trade zone with Chile is not viable and that trade 
relations should continue within the framework of the Economic 
Complementation Agreement (ACE) signed by the two countries last 
year. 
  This decision was made after a serious and profound 
evaluation of the disadvantages national exporters are facing in 
introducing their products in the Chilean market. The most 
difficult problems to overcome are the price list brackets 
established by Chile that restrict the access of exportable 
Bolivian products to the Chilean market. 
  On 13 May, National Industrial Association President Gary 
Lacunza said the talks held with Chilean businesses in an 
environment of agreement established that it is impossible to 
join a free trade zone. 
  The results of the third meeting of the Economic 
Complementation Agreement's Business Advisory Committee (Case), 
held in Santiago, Chile, on 9 and 10 May indicate that despite 
the growth of bilateral trade between Bolivia and Chile, the 
Bolivian trade deficit tends to grow. 
  The issues discussed in the meeting included the low 
exploitation of the Chilean market due to the reduced number of 
exportable Bolivian products, the lack of potentially exportable 
Bolivian products on the agreement list, and the lack of road 
infrastructure, which increases the cost of exportable Bolivian 
products. 
  The main point of discussion was centered, however, on the 
Bolivian proposal to suspend the price list bracket imposed by 
Chile on Bolivian products, which is the biggest restriction on 
Bolivia's access to that market. There was no answer from Chile 
on that proposal. 
  In its final conclusion, the Case recognized that the lack 
of 
adequate trade channels and the tax policy that distorts formal 
trade are the main reasons why little advantage is taken of the 
ACE tariff preferences. 
  The Case made a series of recommendations to balance the 
Chilean-Bolivian trade balance. The recommendations include the 
improvement of the procedures for issuing certificates of origin 
in order to unify the criteria to have the certificates issued 
under the terms of a single regulation. This measure also will 
prevent tariff preferences from benefiting countries that are 
not members of the agreement. 
  Regarding the Draft Agreement on Reciprocal Protection and 
Promotion, the agreement recommends that the draft be signed as 
soon as possible. 
  Regarding double taxation in the two countries on exportable 
products, a decision was made to sign an agreement similar to 
other agreements. For this purpose, the Chilean side presented 
the agreement signed with Argentina on this issue. 
  A recommendation also was made that the Animal and Plant 
Health Cooperation Agreement be signed as soon as possible. 
  Regarding the difference between the amount of Chilean 
exports and the amount of Bolivian imports, which shows a trade 
of $70 million through smuggling, the Case recommended the 
signing of a cooperation agreement between customs agencies in 
the two countries. 
  The evaluation made by the Case also refers to collateral 
issues to the agreement's development such as the case of 
pharmaceutical products, which must not be included in the ACE 
list. 
  The Case also calls for the elimination of consular visas in 
order to make bilateral relations easier and more flexible, and 
for the incorporation of air transportation in the agreement. 
  The Case also noted the need for the Management Commission 
to 
answer the proposals made in the third meeting within 30 days, 
starting on the day the recommendations were made. 
  Lacunza also reported that in the next few days a study will 
begin on the proposals the private sector will submit to the 
government to get the government to meet the conditions demanded 
for the growth of the productive sector with the resulting 
benefit for the country's general economic activity.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 May (Fides News Agency) -- Bolivia will 
participate in a meeting with the Consultative Group [not 
further specified] during the first week of November. Bolivia 
will participate in a meeting with the Paris Club in October to 
reschedule the bilateral foreign debt. 
  The dates were confirmed by Finance Minister Fernando 
Cossio, 
who also confirmed a meeting with the IMF for late May to reach 
a new agreement on structural adjustment. 
  Bolivia seeks financing from the Consultative Group. In 
1993, Bolivia received commitments for more than $1 billion over 
a four-year period. This year, Bolivia will go to this 
international forum to renew this financial support. 
  Cossio said the government's economic team is preparing a 
strategy to negotiate with the IMF. The new agreement with the 
IMF will be in effect for three years and include the main 
structural reform programs the current administration has in 
mind. 
  The finance minister mentioned that basically the 
capitalization's and the popular participation's impact on the 
fiscal program would be included in the agreement. 
  The minister said it is too early to discuss the amount that 
might be agreed upon with the IMF. He added that the amount 
required by our national economy would be negotiated with the 
IMF. 
  Nevertheless, it is necessary to emphasize that this 
involves 
a grants-in-aid program, including a 10-year repayment period, a 
10-year grace period, and a 0.5 percent interest rate.

  [Text] Congress has approved the provisional measure 
creating the URV [real value unit] and the real. Early on 19 
May, Congress approved Provisional Measure 482 creating the URV. 
  The bill, which was introduced into the Chamber of Deputies 
by Deputy Neuto de Conto, was approved by a vote of 281 to 76, 
with 3 abstentions. In the Senate the provisional measure was 
approved in a symbolic vote. 
  The provisional measure could be approved only after 
negotiations between the government and the rural bloc, which 
did not back the bill. 
  Deputy Nelson Marquezelli, chairman of the Agriculture 
Committee, allowed bloc members to vote for the measure because, 
according to him, 80 percent of the bloc's demands were granted. 
  Leftist parties attempted to obstruct the vote because they 
wanted the measure to provide for compensation of salary losses 
that occurred before implementation of the URV, a minimum salary 
of $100 by December 1994, and free collective bargaining. 
  Brazilian Social Democracy Party lawmakers, however, have 
claimed that the provisional measure does grant the last 
request, provided salary increases are not transferred to 
prices. The measure creates an index for adjustment of prices 
and salaries in reals in case of inflation, sets 1 July for 
circulation of the new currency, and establishes a single index 
for adjustment of prices and for financing agricultural 
production.

  [Excerpt] The economic team is studying the possibility of 
including the shares of public companies in the composition of 
the funds that will back the new real currency. "That is what we 
are currently discussing in the economic team," Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero admitted. He added that he has yet not made a 
decision on how to back the new currency, but he said he is 
"open" to this possibility. "It already has been decided that 
the reserves will be an essential part to back the new currency, 
or perhaps they will be the only backing, but we are studying 
several ideas," he added. Some economic team members already 
have adopted a favorable position regarding the inclusion of the 
public companies' shares. "I will listen to them because they 
have been at this longer than I have and I have no opinion yet" 
on the subject, he said. 
  Ricupero denied that the economic stabilization program 
being 
implemented by the government entails the dollarization of the 
Brazilian economy, as Workers Party presidential candidate Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva has said. "That term would be more 
appropriate for the Cavallo Plan in Argentina," Ricupero said. 
The reserves, he added, are not made up only of dollars, but 
also Japanese yen and German, Swiss, and French marks, among 
other currencies. 
  "The real backing of the new currency will be a healthy 
Brazilian economy," Ricupero said, meaning the capability of 
Brazilian companies to compete in the international market and 
export, thus obtaining a trade surplus. Ricupero nonetheless 
said that he is willing to study the ideas suggested by the 
presidential candidates. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Tahan and Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Text] The PT [Workers Party] is preparing an alternative 
project for the third stage of the government economic 
stabilization plan. The proposal condemns parity exchange 
between the dollar and the real, (that is, $1 for 1 real). PT 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva told O ESTADO: 
"We do not agree with the dollarization of the economy." 
Instead of backing the new currency with dollar reserves, the 
PT will propose creating a national currency back up fund based 
on the patrimony of Brazilian economy. 
  The alternative PT project has been under study for the past 
three months. It will be made public before the end of the 
month, that is, 30 days before the real comes into circulation. 
It clearly has a political and electoral purpose: to state 
Lula's position regarding the government economic program which 
is the basis of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy. 
  "If we have 40 percent of the voters' preference and if we 
are ahead in all polls, we must say what we think of the 
economic plan that, for better or worse, we will probably 
inherit," Lula told O ESTADO. PT government platform 
coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia said: "A frozen exchange rate 
could have serious consequences and may harm the start of the PT 
administration if we win the elections," adding: "This is why it 
is important to establish our position regarding the third stage 
of the government economic plan." 
  Economist Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr. suggested a plan, which 
is being analyzed by a group of PT experts, to establish a 
special mortgage in the Central Bank on private and public, 
foreign and national companies with a net patrimony above a 
certain level. The mortgage would be used to back up the new 
currency. The companies "would be urged" to establish such 
mortgage. 
  The PT is also discussing the possibility of using workers' 
assets, like the Severance Pay Fund [FGTS], to back up the new 
currency. As a counterpart, companies and workers could be 
represented in the Currency Stabilization Council and 
participate in the results of issuing the real [as published]. 
In both cases, Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr.'s proposal foresees 
issuing a security that would be the only one to pay monetary 
correction and a reasonable interest rate. The new currency 
then, could be converted to this security. 
  The mortgage on the companies' patrimony would have a 
expiration date which will be defined by the PT. "When the 
stabilization process concludes, the companies would not suffer 
losses and their patrimony will have not lost its value," said 
PT Senator Eduardo Suplicy, one of the economists studying the 
alternative PT economic project. "In this manner, companies 
would be very interested in the success of the stabilization 
project," he added. 
  Beside this, on the grounds that Lula is currently the 
favorite to win the elections, he intends to negotiate with 
President Itamar Franco on access to the administrative 
apparatus during the election campaign. The PT wants access to 
the figures and data used inside the government to obtain a 
clearer and more objective notion of what awaits it in case it 
wins the elections. "We will ask for access to all the 
available information in order to prepare our government 
programs," one of the main national PT leaders told O ESTADO. 
  The PT proposal, which is being prepared by a group 
comprising Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr., Paul Singer, Deputy 
Aloizio Mercadante, and Suplicy, still generates conflicting 
opinions. Some really want to present the document as an 
alternative government project, while others want to simply 
express the opinions of the PT, without it being a formal 
counterproposal. It has been decided, however, that the 
document will condemn backing the new currency with the dollar 
reserves. "We do not want to receive the government with a 
dollarized economy," said PT national President Rui Falcao. PT 
economists are scared of the possibility that the dollarization 
of the economy may kill Brazilian industry as it did in 
Argentina. 
  The party has not decided yet how to present its proposal: 
Through its congressional bloc, or by Lula himself to mark the 
party's political stance. Either way, the document will be 
announced amid great publicity to gain points in a month of poor 
election campaign performance and when the public's attention is 
concentrated on the upcoming world cup soccer.

  [Text] Today, the Federal Supreme Court [STF] ruled that 
any strike by public servants is illegal. The government has 
already decided not to pay its employees for days not worked. 
Strikes are provoking losses everywhere. 
  Losses have been reported in Santa Catarina State, where 
ships loaded with cargo cannot load or unload due to a strike by 
Federal Revenue Secretariat [SRF] inspectors, who are only 
allowing the unloading of perishable or dangerous commodities, 
such as explosives and fuels. 
  Nearly 300 trucks -- most of which are taking cargo to 
Paraguay -- are standing in a long line outside the customs 
office in Foz do Iguacu, Parana State. Clearance through 
customs is slow owing to the sit-down strike observed by SRF 
inspectors. 
  Some 13,000 tonnes of cargo is sitting in the Cumbica 
international airport of Sao Paulo awaiting customs clearance. 
A court order has ruled that the cargo must be released. The 
striking workers are obeying the court order, but they are also 
observing a sit-down strike, which means the cargo will be 
delayed for at least another month. 
  In Brasilia, the SRF strike has also interrupted the 
reception of tax statements on diskettes. Pensioners and 
retired citizens are making unsuccessful trips to collect their 
checks from social security offices. Even labor accident cases 
are not being processed. In April alone, 30,000 checks were not 
issued and beneficiaries failed to receive 160 billion real 
cruzeiros. 
  The Federal Police strike completed two months today. 
Strikers commemorated the occasion with a cake and with a 
protest rally outside the Justice Ministry. 
  Returning from Rio de Janeiro, President Itamar Franco met 
briefly with Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat and the federal 
administration and social security ministers at the Brasilia air 
base to discuss the wave of strikes by public servants. It has 
been decided that the government will not pay for days not 
worked. 
  Late this afternoon the STF ruled that public servants 
cannot 
exercise the right of strike. Eight of the 11 justices ruled 
that, although the Constitution guarantees the right of strike 
to civilian public servants, the right cannot be exercised until 
it is regulated by Congress. Hence, any strike by public 
servants is illegal.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 18 May (EFE) -- Today, lawyer Juan 
Pablo Hermosilla, who is defending Chilean businessman Carlos 
Cardoen, told EFE that there is a risk the United States may 
order the kidnapping of his client to take him to Miami to try 
him on charges of illegal exportation of a mineral used in Air 
Force cluster bombs. 
  The lawyer said that "we discussed the subject during our 
conversation with U.S. prosecutors, but apparently they will try 
to obtain Cardoen's extradition." 
  Hermosilla said, however, that the risk of kidnapping 
exists, 
as when the United States ordered the kidnapping of a Mexican 
medical doctor accused of drug trafficking. He added: "It is a 
risk, so we will therefore adopt legal measures, as that is 
illegal in Chile." 
  The lawyer mentioned the subject when EFE consulted him 
about 
the trial that began today against the Teledyne company, which 
is accused of having sold to the Cardoen company 100 tons of 
zircon used to manufacture cluster bombs for the Iraqi Army, a 
fact that was omitted when the export permit was requested. 
  Juan Pablo Hermosilla said "it was well known that the 
Cardoen company used zircon to manufacture cluster bombs, 
something that was even described in the company's advertising 
leaflets at the time, and was known by all U.S. diplomats 
accredited in Chile." 
  The lawyer said that the article published yesterday in THE 
NEW YORK TIMES is mistaken in describing zircon as an explosive 
material. 
  "That is not so. It is as if I were to say that the steel 
used in the bolts holding the cluster bomb shell together is an 
explosive material." 
  Hermosilla said that the purchase of zircon from Teledyne 
was 
made directly by the Cardoen company, and not by a subsidiary.

<F P=106> [Article by Pedro Aguilera Flores] </F>
  [Excerpt] Planning and Cooperation Minister Luis Maira 
Aguirre has confirmed to MUNDO ECONOMICO that in April, a Cuban 
Government delegation headed by the director of the Planning 
Board and the deputy principal of the main Havana institute of 
economic studies visited Santiago. The objective of their visit 
was to collect data on the Chilean economic model. 
  As a result of this visit, last week, Minister Maira 
reported 
the implementation of a cooperation plan with the Caribbean 
island. 
  Pressed by its worst crisis since the 1959 revolution, the 
Fidel Castro regime is opening up its economy as the only 
solution to the crisis that followed the fall of the Soviet 
communist bloc in 1991. 
  Last week, Castro's administration implemented drastic 
reforms and austerity measures to fight the scarcity of 
currency, the budget deficit, the drop in the production level, 
and the black market. Among these reforms and measures are an 
increase in the price of basic services; new taxes; and the 
freezing of bank accounts with deposits higher than 10,000 Cuban 
pesos. 
  Along with these measures, Cuba also began to send expert 
missions to collect information on the economic experiences of 
five countries. One of the countries chosen by the Cuban 
Government was Chile. 
  For a week, the Cuban experts talked with officials from the 
Chilean Central Bank and the Ministries of Finance, Foreign 
Affairs, and Planning and Coordination. "They wanted to learn 
about the mechanisms of administering Chilean economic policy 
and the technical instruments with which we work," Maira said. 
  The Cuban experts took copies of already executed programs 
from the Planning and Coordination Ministry as well as plans for 
integrated projects and the national investment system. They 
also learned about regional policies in detail. 
  At the Central Bank, the Cubans analyzed subjects such as 
monetary, banking, and credit policy. They collected 
information on similar subjects in other ministries. According 
to Maira "it was something like an exhaustive trip to learn 
about the Chilean economic system, and they collected useful 
information because they are studying deep economic reforms. 
The short-term work they are carrying out here will therefore 
be very important for them." 
  He stressed that "the Cubans know they must adjust their 
administrative apparatus, as their planned economy is 
inefficient," and that is why they are studying various 
experiences throughout the world that could inform their own 
decision. 
  "They are seeking changes that will allow them to preserve 
the national elements of independence and the accomplishments 
attained through their former economic model. Their greatest 
asset is that from being a colony in 1959, they have become a 
country with national dignity," Maira said. 
  He added that "we showed the Cubans our house; we explained 
to them our procedures, and they thanked us for this 
information." Maira said the Cuban delegation received a good 
impression of the capability and efficiency with which Chileans 
have administrated their economy in the public and private 
sectors. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] According to Teachers' College leaders, there 
was 95 percent compliance with the national strike called for 
today. The education minister acknowledged that there was a 
massive mobilization of teachers, but asserted that the 
government will not withdraw the education bill from Congress 
that sparked off the conflict. [passage omitted] 
  Near midday, teachers organized themselves into four columns 
at different points of the city to march together up to Diego de 
Almagro Square. [passage omitted] 
  Some hours ago, Osvaldo Verdugo [Teachers' College Union 
leader] showed satisfaction in releasing the final assessment of 
the strike. Commenting on the total number of teachers who went 
on strike today, both from municipal schools and from private 
schools with government funding, he said: 
  [Begin Verdugo recording] We are talking about a nationwide 
average of approximately 95 percent of Chilean teachers. [end 
recording] 
  Verdugo stated categorically that the trade union he leads 
will not draw up any new strategy until after the national 
teachers' assembly to be held 25 May. 
  Given this state of affairs, at present, the solution to 
this 
conflict seems as elusive as the possibility of teachers and the 
government talking the same language.

percent in March as compared with the previous month. Cumulative 
production rose 6.4 percent in the year's first quarter; the 
beverage industry registered the highest increase, with 26.5 
percent, and chocolate and candy production rose 11.8 percent. 
(Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 29 Apr 94 Economic

inflation rate has been 3 percent so far this year, and 12.7 
percent in the past 12 months. Clothing increased 4.4 percent; 
housing 0.7 percent; transport 0.2 percent; while food dropped 
0.5 percent. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 4 May 94 Economic 
Section p 7) 
  The INE reported that the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent 
from January to March, an increase of 0.1 percent as compared 
with the same quarter last year. Nationwide, the labor force 
totalled 5,257,050 people; and the number employed was 
4,985,220. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 4 May 94 Economic

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
29 May. 
  On 15 May, Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres 
Pastrana stated that Santa Fe de Bogota needs a friend in the 
presidency; "someone who is acquainted with the city's 
problems." During a visit to several Santa Fe de Bogota 
communities, Pastrana declared he is willing to guarantee the 
necessary assistance to solve the public transportation problem 
starting with the construction of five new highways. He also 
explained his plans to promote low interest housing loans 
through the National Urban Reform Institute, as well as to 
improve the quality of education throughout the nation. Another 
of his proposals consists of implementing unemployment insurance 
aimed exclusively at housing payments. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 16 May p 7A) 
  During a visit to Apartado this past weekend, Liberal Party 
candidate Ernesto Samper took advantage of the opportunity to 
disclose his "15 days strategy" leading to election day. The 
Samper strategy is based on three central points: to marshal 
and mobilize liberals throughout the nation in order for them to 
work for victory in the elections; the strengthening of the 
"Alliance for Colombia" which includes all sectors of Colombian 
society; and lastly, the impressive dissemination of what he 
termed as the "final position," which entails giving a detailed 
account of his proposals and their fundamental differences with 
those of Pastrana. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 16 
May 94 pp 1A, 6A) 
  Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana 
Arango and Liberal Party hopeful Ernesto Samper have both 
stressed the need to call a referendum on the Constitutional 
Court's decision to legalize the possession of minor quantities 
of drugs for personal use. Pastrana indicated that "all 
Colombians must clearly voice their position on the 
Constitutional Court's decision." He also proposed the 
inclusion of a second ballot on the issue in the 29 May 
presidential elections. Ernesto Samper recently sent a note to 
President Cesar Gaviria stating that he supports the president's 
position on calling a referendum and that "it is an issue of 
much significance for the welfare of all Colombian families and 
the younger generation." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 9 May p 6A) 
  Antonio Navarro Wolff, president of the 19 April Democratic 
Alliance, AD/M-19, and presidential candidate, indicated that 
his party "is gambling everything" on the 29 May presidential 
elections. He added that should there be a second election round 
in which he is not included, he is willing to abide by his 
party's decision. The determination, which was made during a 10 
May AD/M-19 national meeting, includes holding a general 
assembly once the election results are made public. According 
to Navarro, this is a way of giving assurances to all those who 
have decided to support him during the elections. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 May 94 p 7A)

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy yesterday received 
Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. Later the president 
said that Paraguay will place a list of national products at the 
disposal of Romanian authorities in order to begin trading with 
that European country. Vacaroiu has begun a four-day official 
visit to the country that will end at 1240 on 21 May. 
  "This is the first time a Romanian prime minister has 
visited 
us. Borders are opening, the world is getting smaller, the 
economy is becoming global, and it is important for these people 
to get acquainted with our country," President Wasmosy said at 
Silvio Pettirossi International Airport. Vacaroiu arrived at 
1450 yesterday. 
  Wasmosy said the government had prepared a draft of 
agreements to be analyzed by the two presidents' ministers and 
advisers. Among the documents that are scheduled to be signed at 
1030 on 21 May are agreements on cultural exchange, the 
elimination of visas for diplomatic and official personnel, 
documents on cooperation between the two countries' foreign 
ministries, and a trade agreement. 
  Wasmosy said the purpose of the trade agreement is to start 
trade relations with Romania, because we want Romanians to know 
what the country can produce. The president added that it is 
also important to know what products Romania can sell to our 
country.

  [Text] Interior Minister Carlos Podesta has recognized that 
the police showed "inefficiency" during the 2 May incidents in 
Tacuara that resulted in the death of young Sebastian Larrosa. 
The minister agreed to answer questions from labor and peasant 
leaders, journalists, and a number of legislators during a 
public meeting at the Radio Primero de Marzo auditorium. Podesta 
admitted that the police shot at shoulder height in Tacuara. He 
was nevertheless strongly accused and criticized for his 
performance at the head of the Interior Ministry. He was also 
criticized for the government's performance. 
  A good portion of the questioning session centered on the 
violent incidents in Tacuara during the 2 May general strike, 
and the murder of peasant leader Esteban Balbuena. The program 
was conducted by journalists Carlos Peralta and Andres Granje. 
  Podesta was calm in answering questions from labor and 
peasant leaders during the program. At some points, however, he 
showed signs of being annoyed, particularly when he heard strong 
accusations against his performance in the case of the death of 
the peasant in Tacuara. 
  The minister defended the image of the police institution at 
all times, saying that it was not a criminal organization. 
  Regarding police performance during the peasant 
demonstration 
at Tacuara, Podesta said that the police had been instructed to 
try to reason with the demonstrators as much as possible, adding 
that no one received orders to shoot at anyone. 
  In the midst of the debate Podesta recognized: "There were 
police officers, more than one, who shot at shoulder height. We 
recorded the incidents, and thanks to the videos we can 
determine who they are. A total of 17 police officers are under 
arrest at this time." 
  Later the minister recognized that the police had been 
inefficient in Tacuara, adding, however, that the police 
officers did not have any ill intentions. 
  Podesta denied that he had received instructions to order 
the 
police to be inflexible during the strike, not even from 
President Wasmosy. 
  Labor leaders Alan Flores and Eduardo Ojeda strongly 
criticized the performance of Podesta, who said he will not hide 
from his responsibility in the event and will not resign. "It is 
not fair to include my resignation among labor's demands," the 
minister told union leaders. 
  Podesta denied that the killing of peasant leader Estaban 
Balbuena had any political implications. He added that an 
in-depth investigation of the case has not produced enough 
evidence to come to that conclusion. 
  The questioning session reached a climax when Arganaist 
[from 
the Luis Maria Argana faction of the Colorado Party] Deputy 
Walter Bower intervened to characterize Podesta as "an expert in 
political warfare." The legislator said the questioning session 
fitted his purposes perfectly, as the minister was able to show 
his qualities and confuse the people even more. 
  At the end of the program, labor and peasant leaders said 
they were not satisfied with Podesta's answers. 
  At one point during the questioning session, Podesta denied 
that peasants were being blamed for wanting to destabilize 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's government. Podesta thus 
contradicted accusations made by the president, who repeatedly 
blamed peasants for the alleged campaign to destabilize his 
government. 
  Labor leaders accused the government of implementing an 
alleged plan to eliminate labor and peasant leaders, citing the 
recent assassinations of Esteban Balbuena and Sebastian Larrosa. 
Podesta categorically denied that the government was planning to 
eliminate social and labor organization leaders. 
  The secretary of state insisted that the police department 
was not a criminal organization, adding that the government was 
working to turn the institution into a healthy organization. 
"This is what we have. We are working on it," Podesta added. At 
another point, the minister said that government authorities 
regret more than anyone else what happened during the 2 May 
general strike. He said the ministry had ordered an inquiry to 
find out exactly what happened. The minister also said he 
trusted that the murders of peasant leaders Esteban Balbuena and 
Sebastian Larrosa would not go unpunished.

<F P=106> ["Text" of draft letter of intent addressed to IMF Executive </F>
Director Michel Camdessus and released by the presidential Press 
Secretariat on 8 May] 
  [Text] 1. This letter explains the Peruvian Government's 
economic policy for 1994 within the context of the Extended Fund 
Facility that was approved by the executive board on 18 March 
1993. The development of the economy in 1993 was in general much 
better than was expected in the program's projections. It is 
estimated that the real GDP has increased by 7 percent, double 
what was estimated in the program's objectives, while net 
international reserves increased to approximately $265 million 
when compared with the program's goal of $195 million. Fiscal 
and monetary discipline has permitted a reduction in inflation 
from 57 percent in 1992 to 39.5 percent in 1993, and to a rate 
of 27 percent per annum during the second half of 1993. All the 
program's goals to December 1993 have been complied with, with 
the exception of the accumulation of delays with official 
creditors that was canceled on or around 9 February 1994. 
  2. The 1994 economic program has the intention of continuing 
with the reduction of inflation to between 15 and 20 percent, 
and of increasing the Central Bank's net international reserves 
by $151 million within the context of a real growth in the GDP 
of between 4 and 5 percent. The government will increase 
structural reforms in order to improve efficiency and increase 
national savings by providing the base for a sustained growth 
and for the viability of the balance of payments. In order to 
complement these internal efforts, the Peruvian Government will 
ask its creditors for a reduction in the balance of the foreign 
debt and its servicing in such a way that it will be viable with 
foreign accounts. The government will intensify its efforts to 
reduce poverty, improve the health, education, and other 
services of the population, and its efforts to consolidate the 
country's pacification, which is essential for the program's 
success. 
  3. In order to achieve these objectives, the public sector's 
primary surplus (prior to the income from privatizations) will 
in 1994 be increased to 0.6 percent of the GDP (up from 0.1 
percent in 1993), which represents a significant advance that 
will help in covering the cash interest payments after the debt 
has been reduced. The public sector's consolidated deficit will 
be maintained at under 2.3 percent of the GDP, and will be fully 
financed with external resources. Efforts will be increased to 
increment tax income to finance the programmed expansion of 
public investment, social programs, and national security. 
  4. The government plans to achieve an increase in its 
current 
income from 10.5 percent of the GDP in 1993 (11.4 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 1993) to 12.1 percent in 1994. Any lack of 
achievement in this respect will be made up with additional tax 
measures. It is hoped that the tax reform that was implemented 
in December 1993 will bring in additional income equivalent to 
0.4 percent of the 1994 GDP; it also expands the tax base and 
simplifies the tax system; and it is hoped that it will give 
continuity to the 1992 tax reform. The government will continue 
to expand the tax base. In will require an overall adjustment 
for inflation in order to estimate the value of assets that are 
subject to the minimum income tax of enterprises and for the 
payment of income tax in 1994. No new tax stability contracts 
will be signed that grant specific tax benefits to enterprises. 
The government will motivate voluntary resolutions of the 
contracts that were signed in the past. The government will not 
create new free trade zones. 
  5. Within the context of deregulation measures aimed at 
promoting privatization, the prices set in November 1993 for oil 
by-products at the refinery (Petroperu) [State Petroleum Agency] 
were comparable to international prices, while the prices for 
consumers were deregulated. Payment of royalties by Petroperu 
and by private contractors, as well as the special rate paid by 
Petroperu to the Public Treasury--that is, 7.5 percent of its 
domestic sales--will be maintained at least until the end of 
1994. These changes are expected to generate additional revenues 
that will account for approximately 0.4 percent of the GDP in 
1994. Other utility rates will continue to be adjusted pursuant 
to the established target rates in their specific regulatory 
systems. 
  6. Revenues will also increase as a result of improvements 
in 
the area of tax administration (Sunat) [National Tax 
Administration Superintendency], especially through new control 
systems implemented this year that include: a) a system of 
collecting taxes through banks; b) a roster of taxpayers (RUC) 
[Centralized Taxpayer Registry]; c) a system of control of the 
use of credit resulting from the General Sales Tax (IGV) by 
exporters; d) a system of cross-checking tax information 
concerning individual companies, their main suppliers and 
purchases, and their import statements; and e) an expansion of 
the system designed to verify compliance with their tax payments 
by the 7,000 leading taxpayers. The simplification of the tax 
system implemented in December 1993 will also contribute to 
improving efficiency in collecting revenues, including the new 
system of fixed payments that are not entitled to fiscal credit 
(RUS) [Simplified Tax System] [Regimen Unico Simplificado], 
which replaces the IGV and income tax, which will incorporate a 
large number of small taxpayers. With IMF technical assistance, 
Sunat has developed a plan to strengthen auditing and monitoring 
mechanisms and has completed an evaluation on evasion of IGV 
payments. Sunat will implement the revised version of the Tax 
Code that was promulgated in December 1993, which markedly 
increases its auditing powers and further simplifies 
administrative procedures. The revised Tax Code also strengthens 
the Fiscal Tribunal. Sunat will provide funds to improve the 
tribunal's operations. There will be two chambers specialized in 
hearing tax lawsuits, and it has been established that the 
Economy and Finance Ministry will be able to increase the number 
of these chambers, if necessary. 
  7. During 1994 the National Customs Superintendency will 
continue with its personnel training program and will extend its 
automated system to all of its offices nationwide. New 
legislation will be submitted to Congress during the first half 
of 1994 to fight smuggling more intensively, by meting out 
stiffer sanctions and by investing Customs with greater powers 
to deal with criminal cases in direct coordination with Sunat. 
Like the Fiscal Tribunal, the Customs Tribunal will consist of 
six chambers, though this number could be even higher. 
  8. The fiscal program incorporates the use of $250 million, 
in cash revenues from the privatizations to be undertaken in 
1994, to supplement current revenues in order to finance social 
investments and the government's structural reforms. Moreover, 
up to one-fourth of proceeds from privatizations that exceed the 
aforementioned amount can be earmarked--with the help of the 
World Bank and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank]--for 
projects having a high social rate of return, especially in the 
construction industry, highway maintenance, and infrastructure 
in rural areas. The ceiling for these endeavors is $626 million. 
The remaining amount will be deposited in a Treasury account at 
the Central Reserve Bank. Funds from this account may be used 
for paying debts that pay a high interest rate, or to prefinance 
loan disbursements for projects approved by the World Bank or 
the IDB with agreement to reimburse. The government pledges to 
follow the programs closely to ensure that their objectives of 
stabilization and growth are met. 
  9. Total expenditures by the nonfinancial public sector 
(excluding interest payments) will rise from 10.8 percent of GDP 
in 1993 to 11.8 percent in 1994. The expansion of capital 
outlay--which will lay stress on infrastructure development, 
social programs, and structural reforms--accounts for most of 
the increase. Expenditures from the social emergency scheme 
(including outlay by the National Compensation and Social 
Development Fund, Foncodes) will increase from 0.6 percent of 
GDP in 1993 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 1994. This program, 
together with other expenditures in social programs amounting to 
approximately 3 percent of GDP, will especially target the 
following areas: nutrition, primary health care programs, and 
education, to alleviate poverty in rural areas and in those 
areas that have been hardest hit by terrorism and drug 
trafficking. The central government's payroll and spending on 
defense are expected to increase at a faster pace than GDP 
because of salary arrears going back to 1993; readjustment of 
civil servants' salaries, which are still low compared to those 
in the private sector; and expenses in the ongoing effort to 
consolidate the pacification of the country, to rout terrorism, 
and to combat drug trafficking. 
  10. The Central Reserve Bank will continue to make every 
endeavor to meet the program's targets concerning inflation and 
the balance of payments. During 1994, the Central Bank's net 
domestic assets will remain unchanged, and there will be no net 
domestic credit to the overall nonfinancial public sector. The 
Central Bank's net international reserves will increase by some 
$151 million. The fiscal deficit will be eliminated thanks to 
the reduction in compensation for minimum reserve requirements 
in foreign exchange in November 1993 and fresh revenues stemming 
from Treasury interests on the capitalization of the Central 
Bank in May 1994. The Central Bank will try not to reduce 
minimum reserve requirements in domestic currency, and will 
grant discounts only in cases of transitory liquidity problems. 
The growth of the monetary base will be limited to 20 percent 
this year. 
  11. During 1994, the government will continue to implement a 
floating exchange rate policy. It is estimated that the recent 
reduction in compensation for minimum reserve requirements in 
foreign currency, together with the programmed fiscal position, 
will reduce capital flows and ease off pressure on the 
appreciation of the currency in 1994. The Central Bank will 
follow developments in the exchange market very closely, and if 
circumstances make it necessary to step up foreign 
competitiveness, the government will be willing to effect a 
greater fiscal adjustment than the one envisaged in the fiscal 
program. 
  12. The 1994 program is fully financed, taking into account 
the debt relief by the Paris Club in May 1993 and the payment 
postponement of debt obligations to other creditors. Peru has 
reached bilateral agreements with most of its creditors listed 
in the minutes of the agreement with the Paris Club in May 1993, 
and will seek to soon end negotiations with the remaining 
creditors. Peru has started negotiations with the commercial 
banking sector, and it is hoped that these negotiations will end 
in a voluntary reduction of the debt and the servicing of the 
debt by late 1994 or early 1995. Agreements to reschedule the 
debt have been reached with certain creditors, and in 1994 Peru 
will start contacts with other private and bilateral creditors 
that do not belong to the Paris Club, with the purpose of 
exploiting other ways to normalize financial relations. The 
government hopes that the possible agreements with the 
commercial banking sector and other creditors will significantly 
contribute to settling Peru's balance of payments and its fiscal 
creditworthiness. Peru's high debt ratio compared to its GDP, 
and the exceptionally high amount of interest in arrears, will 
have to be taken into account for these agreements. Within the 
context of the privatization of public enterprises, and as part 
of a strategy regarding the amount of the debt and its 
servicing, the government has included a scheme for converting 
the debt into investments, allowing all its creditors to use 
debt notes for this purpose. In order to continue improving the 
Peruvian foreign debt, the program limits the medium- and 
long-term foreign public debt (which is different from the debt 
with multilateral organizations and that contracted in the form 
of concessions) contracted in 1994 to $300 million, and the 
increase in the short term debt to $25 million. No delays in 
payment to international financial institutions nor to the Paris 
Club creditors are expected. 
  13. During 1994 and early 1995, the remaining public 
enterprises, of various sectors of the economy, will be 
privatized. The Cerro Verde mining company and the 
telecommunication companies (CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] 
and Entel [National Telecommunications Enterprise]) were sold in 
early 1994, and the other mining company (Centromin [Central 
Peru Mining Enterprise]) will be put up for sale around May. 
There are plans to put a commercial bank (Interbanc) up for sale 
by June 1994. Moreover, during the second half of 1994 the 
Peruvian Government will offer for sale 60 percent of the 
Electro-Lima [Peruvian State Electric Power Enterprise-Lima] 
generating and distribution network, the Minero-Peru [Peruvian 
State Mining Enterprise] refinery in Cajamarquilla, part of 
Petro-Peru [State Petroleum Agency], and part of the fishing 
company Pesca-Peru [State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production 
Agency]. As is stated in Paragraph 12, in February 1994 the 
government issued regulations on the use of the mechanism to 
convert the debt into investments in the case of the 
privatization process. The use of this debt conversion system 
will be allowed in specific cases when the privatization process 
faces greater difficulties. 
  14. Through the application of the new Banks Law promulgated 
in October 1993, in 1994 the National Superintendency of Banks 
and Insurance Companies (SBS) will continue to enhance sound 
regulations by intensifying the inspection of banks, seeking a 
policy that will handle the problem of dubious bank assets, and 
promoting the capitalization of the financial system. By late 
1994 all provisions for bad credits and credits that lack 
guarantees will be required. A special SBS unit will place all 
risk debtors at the same level. The SBS will also focus all its 
efforts on improving the handling of information and its human 
resources with technical assistance from the IDB. 
  15. The government promulgated a new statute for the Bank of 
the Nation in January 1994, and its restructuring is expected to 
conclude around September 1994, in accordance with the 
guidelines recently agreed upon with the World Bank. As the 
agent of the Treasury, bank operations will be restricted to the 
management of public accounts, and will not include commercial 
operations with the private sector or interbanking operations. 
The Popular Bank branch in Bolivia was privatized in November 
1994 [as published] and the liquidation of the Popular Bank is 
expected to be completed in December 1994. The liquidation of 
the remaining assets of the development bank will also be 
concluded in December 1994. 
  16. The creation of the Private Pension System in June 1993, 
as an alternative to the public pension system, is expected to 
contribute to the increase in overall savings in the economy. A 
new Superintendency of Private Pension Fund Administration was 
created to regulate the funds. The regulations in this area will 
continue to be improved as necessary. The Peruvian Institute of 
Social Security will only provide health services, and therefore 
it will restructure its personnel in accordance with its new 
functions established in 1994. The Social Security Normalization 
Office (ONP), which will begin operations in June 1994, will 
gradually take over responsibility for the operation of the 
public pension system. The pension payment will be financed with 
a transfer of about 300 million soles from the Treasury in 1994. 
  17. The government will continue to liberalize and simplify 
the trade system. The list of products subject to the 25 percent 
tariff rate was reduced even further in 1993, leaving less than 
2 percent of the value of imports at this tariff level. The 
objective is to unify all tariffs at 15 percent by 1995. A 
timetable was reached with the IDB, within the context of the 
Sectorial Loan for Trade, to gradually reduce the surcharge on 
agricultural products with the objective of eliminating it by 
July 1997. The government will conclude the privatization of the 
National Enterprise for Industrial Marketing (ENCI) by December 
1994. In addition, the trade negotiations with the Andean Group 
have concluded satisfactorily. Agreements are also being 
negotiated with other countries, like Argentina, Chile, and 
Mexico, to reduce trade barriers. Peru has signed the Uruguay 
Round agreement. 
  18. The government will strengthen its policies to reduce 
poverty as an essential element for consolidating the 
pacification program and the substantial progress made in 
stabilizing the economy. In 1994, Peru began a global program of 
social stabilization which will coordinate efforts in the areas 
of education, health, nutrition, justice, and job creation with 
its own resources, donations, and funds from multilateral 
institutions. For this purpose Peru has asked for technical 
assistance from the IMF and the IDB to implement the programs 
against poverty, within the context of a general follow-up to 
the policy and management of public spending. 
  19. During 1994 the government will continue its efforts to 
increase educational coverage and quality. These efforts will be 
concentrated on decentralizing education and introducing a 
direct budget appropriation system for schools based on the 
number of students. A pilot plan will be carried out during 
1994, in an attempt to cover between 100,000 and 150,000 
elementary school students. 
  20. Substantial progress was attained during 1993 to make 
the 
labor market more flexible, through the proclamation of a law 
that allows several kinds of labor contracts, a flexible 
position regarding job security, and which regulates the 
collective labor bargain process with the purpose of minimizing 
labor disputes. The government will propose a new Labor Code 
that will consolidate and harmonize the existing laws, with the 
purpose of further reducing the strict norms of the labor market 
according with the new 1993 Constitution. The arbitration 
procedures will be revised in order to expedite labor dispute 
settlements. 
  21. The government believes that it is necessary to 
substantially improve its knowledge of the macroeconomic 
situation in order to better analyze and plan the economic 
policy. Many of the recommendations made by the IMF monitoring 
mission during its March/April 1993 visit have already been 
implemented. The government has established a permanent 
interinstitutional committee made up of high-ranking officials 
from the Economy and Finance Ministry, the Central Reserve Bank, 
and the National Institute of Statistics and Information 
Science, to help adopt coordinated measures to improve the 
macroeconomic statistics of each sector and to promote a 
consistent statistical methodology among all sectors. The 
government will likewise take action to improve the compilation 
of national accounts and to correct deficiencies in the 
Consumers Price Index and in the GDP deflators, with technical 
assistance from the IMF. 
  22. The government considers that the policies described in 
this letter are appropriate for attaining the objectives of the 
economic program, and it will adopt any additional measure 
appropriate for this purpose. The Peruvian Government and the 
IMF will hold periodical meetings according to the policy on 
such meetings, as specified in our 18 March 1993 letter. Before 
the end of August 1994, and every three months from then onward, 
the external financing of the economic program will be reviewed 
until a satisfactory agreement is reached, as specified in our 
19 March 1993 letter. The execution of the economic program 
described in this letter will be revised together with the IMF 
before the end of August 1994. The evaluation criteria of the 
program are described in Charts 1, 2, and 3. The evaluation 
criteria for 1995 and the calendar for future revisions of the 
economic program will be established not later than 15 March 
1995. The IMF will maintain at the disposal of Peru the funds of 
the Expanded Financial Facilities Agreement. Peru may use these 
funds, if necessary, to finance debt restructuring programs; 
Peru will also be able to ask for an increase of the funds of 
said agreement, according to what is established by IMF norms in 
these cases. 
  Respectfully, 
  Jorge Camet, Minister of Economy and Finance 
  German Suarez Chavez, President of the Peruvian Central 
Reserve Bank

<F P=106> [Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle published in </F>
the Argentine newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Conducting a provisional 
stocktaking of your administration, what has satisfied you most 
and what are the frustrations after four and a half years of 
tenure? 
  [Lacalle] Considering we are a minority government--of which 
we were already aware before the 1989 elections--I believe we 
have accomplished quite a lot. 
  Indeed, we have done everything we were permitted. We could 
not do some things because we lacked the support of Congress or 
of the citizenship--as in the case of the Law on 
Government-Owned Enterprises. This was the fate of the two most 
important issues the country must resolve, namely the social 
security system and the privatization of state-run enterprises. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What happened to those questions? 
  [Lacalle] It is very simple. The privatization of 
government-owned enterprises came under fire at the plebiscite. 
[Former president and Colorado Party leader] Dr. Julio Maria 
Sanguinetti and left-wing sectors campaigned against it under 
the slogan "Vote Against the Government." It goes without saying 
that they won a political victory, but they acted like a brake 
on the modernization of Uruguay, slowing it by several years. 
  Moreover, they acted even though Congress had enacted a 
watered down and tempered privatization law. 
  With regard to social security, we submitted a reform bill 
to 
Congress but we could not muster the necessary votes to pass it. 
  Last year, for example, the state had to subsidize the 
social 
security system to the tune of $282 million. 
  Imagine what that means to a country whose annual export 
earnings total $1.7 billion. This situation affects the 
competitiveness of companies because labor is very expensive in 
Uruguay and the cost of living goes up for workers. This may 
sound a bit pompous, but our responsibility to our country and 
to history is saved. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What do you think about Dr. Sanguinetti, 
who considers the Broad Front as his only political opponent in 
the run-up to the elections? He even predicts that the 27 
November elections will polarize voters around himself and 
[Broad Front presidential candidate] Tabare Vazquez? 
  [Lacalle] As I do not like making political prophecies, I 
will tell you an anecdote. Before the 1989 elections, the 
Colorado Party contended that it would govern until the year 
2000, and that its main rival was the Broad Front. 
  All the public opinion polls supported this forecast. Six 
months later, I won the elections by the greatest margin ever 
recorded in our history. Sanguinetti is merely using a political 
strategy. 
  If you want to know why, you must ask him. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The problem is that for the time being 
he 
does not want to talk to the press. 
  [Lacalle] Well, Dr. Sanguinetti said something very 
important 
in Buenos Aires, on [Bernardo] Neustadt's television program. He 
said: "We do just fine until we open our mouths." 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The local press say you have lost clout 
with your own political faction and that you are unable to 
impose Senator Juan Andres Ramirez's candidacy. Is that true? 
  [Lacalle] I have been in politics for 35 years and was the 
first elected "Blanco" [Party] president in 160 years. During 
those years, I have fallen and started anew. I have endured 
bombs planted by Tupamaros guerrillas and the action of hooded 
military men, and I have lost more elections than I have won. 
This is just another circumstance, but I will respond in a more 
precise way on 28 November. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What do you think about of Argentine 
interest in joining NAFTA? 
  [Lacalle] Brazil and Argentina are interested in other forms 
of integration because of their internal policies and not 
because they are not interested in the Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South]. Argentina is determined over the issue of NAFTA 
and Brazil has a project, which to some extent is an alternative 
to Mercosur--the South America Free Trade Zone. I believe it is 
a big mistake because political anxiety is the worst fate to 
befall a country's foreign policy. 
  By signing the Treaty of Asuncion, we committed ourselves to 
establishing one of the largest markets in the world. If we do 
so appropriately and expeditiously, we can partake in this game 
of giants in which economic blocs rather than individual 
countries participate. Argentina and Brazil would attain what 
seems to be their objective of belonging to the first world by 
enhancing each other's position--and with our 
participation--within the Mercosur. 
  [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Last week the United States declared 
Uruguay "eligible" to join NAFTA. Are you not tempted? 
  [Lacalle] No, because I do not look to the United States to 
guide my life, even though I must obviously take it into 
account. For me, the United States' positive evaluation of our 
country can only be interpreted as a compliment. What I did 
propose to President Bill Clinton is a link between NAFTA and 
Mercosur. This would not rob Uruguay of its sleep as it already 
has a priority--Mercosur.

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Rondan in Mercedes] </F>
  [Excerpt] Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella has 
announced the establishment of an organization for the 
development of our region. CODEFRO [expansion unknown] will be 
established as a binational agency within six weeks. The 
municipalities on the Uruguay River will join the foreign 
ministries. 
  Foreign Minister Di Tella on 11 May told the Uruguay River 
mayors that within six weeks the CODEFRO binational agency will 
be established under an agreement with the Argentine Government. 
  The Argentine and Uruguayan municipalities will play a very 
important political and technical role in this organization, 
because they, along with the foreign ministries, will be 
executive committee members. 
  The CODEFRO project, sponsored by the Inter-American 
Development Bank, will therefore be implemented. It represents 
the crowning of two years of work by the Planning and 
Negotiations Committee, which represents five Uruguayan 
municipalities and seven Argentine municipalities. It also 
represents a pilot project in Latin America in the field of 
regional integration, and a subsystem within Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] planning. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 19 May. 
  The National Statistics Institute has reported that the 
Consumer Price Index increased by 3.52 percent in April. The 
accrued inflation in the first quarter of the year added up to 
11.65 percent as compared with 16.1 percent in the corresponding 
period in 1993. Food and beverages, transportation, and 
communications registered the highest price increases. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 8) 
  The trade deficit continued its upward trend in February, 
reaching $51.8 million. Exports grew by 6.5 percent while 
imports increased by nearly 17 percent in the first two months 
of 1994, resulting in a $122.3 million deficit. The reasons 
behind the trade deficit are: lack of competitiveness, the 
increase in salaries, the cost of living, the decline in the 
price of some products on the international market, and the 
reduction of tariffs that spurred purchases of imported goods. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 4 May 94 p 9) 
  The Central Bank's net international reserves increased by 
$2.3 million in April, totaling $1.2587 billion. International 
reserves have increased by $56.8 million so far this year. The 
monetary base shrunk by $201.5 million last month due to a 
$208.8 million drop in the net domestic credit granted by the 
Central Bank. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 5 May 94 Market 
Indicators Section p 1) 
  Despite the fact that Uruguayan exports to Common Market of 
the South, Mercosur, member countries increased by 25.1 percent 
in the first two months of the year, its trade deficit with 
these countries added up to $78.7 million, thus registering a 
43.1 percent increase compared with the corresponding period in 
1993. There is a trade deficit of $48.3 million with Brazil and 
a deficit of $32.7 million with Argentina, while the surplus 
with Paraguay amounts to $2.3 million. (Montevideo EL PAIS in 
Spanish 5 May 94 Market Indicators Section p 1) 
  According to figures released by the Central Bank, Uruguay 
grew by an average 3.3 percent per annum in the four years of 
the Blanco Party administration. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR 
ECONOMICO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 10) 
  The State Board of Sanitation chairman has reported that 
public water rates increased by 11 percent as of 1 May. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 10) 
  The Central Bank has reported that the public 
sector--including government-owned enterprises, town halls, and 
other decentralized agencies--registered a $9.1 million deficit 
in January 1994 despite the central government's $6.9 million 
surplus. The financial position of the public sector has been 
deteriorating since last year, when after recording a $51 
million surplus in the first quarter, it showed a deficit 
amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP by the end of the year. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 11) 
  According to data released by the Central Bank, private 
consumption in Uruguay grew by 25.7 percent from 1990 to 1993. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 8) 
  The Central Bank reported on 9 May that the central 
government registered a $12.6 million surplus in March. The 
accrued government surplus in the first quarter of the year 
totals $29.2 million. Despite these positive economic 
indicators, the government's accounts continued to deteriorate 
in the first quarter of the year, as revenues grew by 1.9 
percent while expenditures increased by 11.6 percent. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 8) 
  Basing its information on data released by the Central Bank 
and the IMF, the Finance Ministry disclosed on 10 May that 
imports of capital goods have grown by 121 percent over the last 
four years. Purchases of capital goods, however, declined by 2.7 
percent in the first two months of the year as compared with the 
corresponding period in 1993. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR 
ECONOMICO in Spanish 11 May 94 p 9) 
  Uruguay's net external debt has dropped by 27 percent over 
the last four years due to a 47 percent increase in net 
international reserves. The per capita debt has declined from 
$1,021 to $753 over the last four years. Nevertheless, the total 
gross external debt has increased by 12.9 percent in the period 
under consideration. It amounted to $7.89 billion at the end of 
1993, thus representing 57 percent of GDP. The net external debt 
totals $2.373 billion. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in 
Spanish 11 May 94 p 9) 
  The Central Bank has reported that investments in fixed 
capital grew by 11.8 percent in 1993 while private consumption 
increased by 4 percent. This led to a 5.5 percent expansion in 
domestic demand. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 12 May 94 p 26)

<F P=106> [Report by Alexander Barrios in Caracas from the "Union </F>
Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Upon leaving Technical Judicial Police [PTJ] 
facilities, where he has been registered in the police corps' 
criminal files, former President Carlos Andres Perez termed as 
an absolute outrage the Supreme Court of Justice's [CSJ] 
decision to issue an arrest warrant for him. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez] You cannot mistreat a man who has 
struggled 50 years for Venezuela and has twice been president of 
the Venezuelans! 
  [Unidentified reporter] The terms of the document.... 
  [Perez, interrupting] The Venezuelans believe in me! 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Perez] The fact is there are no charges against me. That is 
a...[pauses] that report published in EL UNIVERSAL is shameful. 
The fact is there is no evidence about anything, yet the charges 
against me are incredible. I am accused of helping stabilize 
democracy in Nicaragua and that the person who received 
Venezuelan state security funds was President Violeta Chamorro, 
an prominent Latin American woman. This accusation is 
interference in the executive branch's purview of international 
relations. [end recording] 
  The former president reiterated that under no circumstances 
does the law allow him to reveal how the secret funds were spent. 
  [Begin Perez recording] No one knows how the secret funds 
were distributed because it is a secret, and the law forbids me 
to reveal that. Second, there is absolutely no evidence or proof 
of anything. Third, international relations is the exclusive 
purview of the president of the Republic, meaning the executive 
branch, and the CSJ is interfering in the executive branch's 
activities when it tries to establish guidelines for how to 
handle the state's foreign security affairs. [end recording] 
  Following these statements, former President Perez left the 
PTJ facilities and went to the site of his imprisonment, that is 
El Junquito Jail. The triumphant way in which the former 
president left was surprising--waving to all those had gathered 
in front of the PTJ building.

  [Text] Caracas, 16 May -- Defense Minister General Rafael 
Montero Revette stated today that there are sectors interested 
in creating apprehension in the democratic system through a 
campaign of rumors such as those disseminated last weekend about 
President Rafael Caldera's health. 
  The defense minister made these remarks at the National 
Congress Administrative Headquarters where he had been summoned 
by the Chamber of Deputies Environment Committee to discuss 
issues related to the environmental problems faced in the 
southern part of the country. The hearing was called off due to 
absence of the parliamentarians, only Committee President Cesar 
Perez Vivas was present. 
  In this respect, the defense minister urged the media not to 
fall prey to the rumors "since they only overwhelm the country 
and what we want to do is pull away from this crisis through 
employment, before the violence which has appeared recently 
spreads throughout the country and threatens all Venezuelans. 
With or without weapons, we must maintain peace." 
  On the presence of masked groups [encapuchados], Gen. 
Revette 
said they are manipulative because they go around promoting 
violence and only block progress. These groups are contrary to 
peace and quiet in Venezuela." 
  Likewise, the defense minister ruled out the likelihood of a 
social explosion and added that violence in Venezuela can never 
be rationalized. He added that "we are aware that there are 
problems, and we are urging all Venezuelans to remain calm and 
collectedn order to try to solve these problems." 
  He indicated that he has ordered the National Police into 
the 
streets every morning with the mission of preventing violence. 
We believe the students are confident that these problems will 
not continue and that there will be an end to violence, as well 
as that we will all work in peace." 
  In reference to the accusations made by retired Lieutenant 
Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias with respect to a coup attempt, the 
defense minister said that Chavez must present evidence of his 
allegations since intelligence operations have failed to turn up 
anything. There have been new reports and we are confronting a 
situation of constant accusations without any evidence, which 
are aimed at specific institutions or trade unions." 
  Nevertheless, he added, the National Armed Forces [FAN] 
intelligence members and other state security organizations are 
working 24 hours a day. With respect to military promotions, he 
indicated that the promotion process has been clear throughout 
the current year, and that the list of candidates will be 
forwarded to the National Congress for evaluation sometime at 
the end of this month. 
  With respect to the summons, the general indicated that 
during the next few days he will present a report to the 
Committee on Environmental Problems, which will be from the 
military's perspective.

<F P=106> [Report by Yonis Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Upon leaving Miraflores, Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez asserted that his office estimates the country will 
earn additional income of approximately 6 billion bolivares from 
PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] thanks to an increase in oil prices 
in May. 
  According to the minister, this income will help efforts to 
balance the budget deficit. "But I don't have too many hopes. I 
believe we will earn enough foreign exchange to be able to meet 
the country's needs--I mean, all its exports and the debt 
servicing. I should point out that the increase in the price of 
oil is due to an increase in demand for oil and the improving 
U.S. economic situation." 
  The minister reported the government has collected 3.1 
billion bolivares in bank debit taxes. "We have not had any 
problems in collecting those revenues. The system has worked 
satisfactorily, and the banking sector has not had any computer 
problems." 
  Regarding the concession law approved by the Council of 
Ministers, Sosa Rodriguez said the legal mechanism for 
construction of public works will attract foreign investors to 
the country and will provide economic compensation for the 
budget cuts made to several national interest projects. 
  Referring to the sales tax law, the finance minister 
affirmed 
that this law will be approved by the executive on Wednesday. 
When he was asked if they planned to extend the tax on banking 
debits, he replied: "I don't think it's right to extend this 
tax." 
  The IMF visit to Venezuela has triggered public expectations 
regarding the economic conditions and programs it plans to 
suggest to the government. In this respect, Sosa stated: "From a 
psychological point of view, it would be good for the IMF to 
officially prop up the level of our reserves and make a public 
statement on the situation. This would have a positive impact on 
our economy and deter the negative influence of speculators and 
rumors about our currency. In conclusion, it would make it more 
difficult for speculators who work in our markets." 
  Likewise, he added that the only point the IMF could 
question 
is the suspension of the value-added tax (VAT). "Everyone knows 
this tax had to be lifted because the country was neither 
prepared nor organized to collect this kind of revenue. The 
methodology was used for commercial speculation to the detriment 
of the citizens." 
  On the same subject, the minister said: "Another thing the 
IMF could ask is why we have not increased the price of 
gasoline. On this point, I have always said we are going through 
an economic crisis, an inherited chaos, and to straighten things 
out we need to grant several administration subsidies to the 
collective transportation sector." 
  On another topic, Sosa Rodriguez asserted that he is still 
studying the possibility of requesting support or other types of 
help from the IMF. "For the time being, however, both the IMF 
and the government, as had been planned, will work together for 
two weeks to study the economic situation and come up with a 
joint assessment." 
  Another international financial organization that recently 
visited Venezuela was the World Bank. Julio Sosa Rodriguez said 
that the World Bank officials met with President Caldera. "They 
came to help us with the subsidized banks, and I believe their 
observations have been very positive. They offered to send us 
this week, a group of technicians to help Fogade [Deposit 
Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and the Banking 
Superintendent's Office in solving management and financial aid 
problems." 
  Sosa reported the executive had requested credits, which are 
fully justified, for 156 billion bolivares from Congress. This 
money includes the resources for paying all government 
employees, including those in the Judiciary Council. "The only 
observation the Congress's Finance Commission had on my request 
was that I had not included allotments for corresponding social 
benefits."

<F P=106> [By Fabiola Vechionacce from the "180 Minutes of News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Finance Ministry adviser Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon 
has said that revenues generated by an increase in the price of 
petroleum will be used to pay the country's foreign debt and for 
social programs. He described as positive the talks with an IMF 
mission but refused to give details on any possible agreements. 
  Moreno said that progress was achieved with the World Bank, 
which disbursed $2 billion to cover the first stage of a program 
to modernize the Finance Ministry's tax system. He also 
commented on adjustments that must be made to the 1995 budget. 
Here are his remarks on reducing fiscal expenses: 
  [Begin Moreno recording] As for a reduction of expenses, we 
already made an important adjustment that represents about 7 to 
8 percent of what was planned in the budget and about 200 
billion [currency not specified] from special requests. 
[sentence as heard] I think that in next year's budget we need 
not only an adjustment but an in-depth reorientation of expenses. 
  At the ministry we are already working on regulations that 
will be presented to the minister for discussion by the Council 
of Ministers. I think that the government should begin to 
implement its program in next year's budget, because this year 
we had to adjust to the situation that confronted us. Next year, 
however, we must begin to implement the letter of intent 
presented by the president to the Venezuelan people by 
reorganizing the 1995 budget. [end recording] 
  The Finance Ministry adviser added that revenues obtained 
from gasoline price increases will be revealed before year end.

<F P=106> [Report by Eneida Cortez] </F>
  [Text] The Solidarity Commitment program planned by the 
Development Ministry to curb inflationary levels will undergo 
drastic changes as a result of the imbalance in foreign 
exchange, which will undoubtedly cause an increase in the prices 
of goods and services. 
  Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios made that remark 
and stressed that the lack of confidence in the financial system 
and the continuous injection of assistance to banks have 
generated an absolute imbalance in the foreign exchange market, 
which, should it continue, will hamper any macroeconomic program 
that may be implemented. 
  It is worth noting, he said, that, after adjustments in the 
foreign exchange were made, the price of a large number of the 
component parts used in national production and considered 
imported raw materials will go up, leading to an increase in the 
price of the final product. 
  The initial objective of the Development Ministry regarding 
consensus on prices will be affected in view of this new 
macroeconomic situation, and, for that reason, an abrupt 
reorientation not based on orthodox policies will be needed. 
  One must keep in mind that the economic crisis the country 
is 
experiencing is the legacy of the vicious circle of the past and 
of scant supervision over the financial system. One must also 
note, he said, that the poor concepts, implemented by certain 
independent entities, of giving constant financial assistance to 
curb the problem of liquidity led to a gigantic infusion of 
monetary resources that did not take into consideration its 
repercussions on the economy. As a result, this heated up the 
climate of crisis we are now experiencing. 
  The Development Ministry's plan to curb slightly the impact 
of the monetary devaluation comprises two aspects. The first 
aspect involves continued talks, despite disagreements with the 
major producers of goods and services, to try to minimize the 
potential price adjustment. This means there is a possibility 
that the monetary changes will be reflected in prices. For that 
reason, what matters now is that these increases not exceed the 
levels of the foreign exchange market. The second aspect is to 
stipulate clearly that once the turbulence has ceased we must 
resume, with greater force, the concerted effort planned 
regarding solidarity . 
  It was also reported that the Development Ministry is 
negotiating with local industrialists to reduce the initial 
impact of the adjustments, estimated to be between 20 and 30 
percent. If that agreement is reached, the adjustments will be 
made based on the devaluation of the previous week, which was 
from 12 to 13 percent. Price increases for medicines were higher 
than predicted, and for that reason the authorities have 
considered imposing sanctions, consisting of rolling back prices 
to their previous level.

  [Text] Merida -- A guerrilla cell was dismantled by the 
National Guard in a mountain area known as "Los Giros," near the 
Pan-American Highway, in Merida State. The place is located on 
the Tachira State border, in the southern zone adjoining 
Maracaibo Lake. 
  The group was arrested during a security operation 
undertaken 
by the National Guard against outlaws and irregular groups. 
Group members were followed when they tried to implement their 
plan to kidnap a cattleman and his son. 
  Intelligence work by the National Guard and police revealed 
the guerrillas' presence south of the lake. The operation led 
the police to the mountain area of Los Giros, very close to the 
farm owned by cattleman Manuel Maria Guerrero. The criminals had 
camped near the farm to kidnap Manuel Maria Guerrero and his 
son, who was not identified. 
  The prisoners were identified as Alfredo Perez Alcina (26 
years), alleged member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia, Alvaro Pena Bejas, Carlos Rojas Tarazona, and a minor 
whose name was not revealed. The authorities confiscated a 
pistol, a revolver, knives, and canned food during the operation. 
  The four prisoners were turned over to the PTJ [Technical 
Judicial Police] in Merida, and authorities are investigating 
their possible ties with and financial support from the 
Colombian guerrilla groups that operate along the border.

  [Text] More questions than answers remain as the region 
continues to discuss the controversial NAFTA accord. The latest 
voice in what is proving to be a series of never-ending debates 
is that of David Thompson. Thompson, the finance minister in 
Barbados, says the region cannot afford to sit on the edge of 
all that is happening. 
  NAFTA is a joint trade agreement signed last year between 
the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. The big debate in Barbados 
and the region is how the grouping will respond to NAFTA. There 
already seems to be a split within Caricom [Caribbean Common 
Market] circles as to whether or not the grouping should proceed 
to enter NAFTA as a unit or to allow individual countries 
desirous of doing so to be approved to proceed.

  [Text] On 17 May, Felipe Sola, the Argentine agriculture, 
livestock, and fishing secretary, and Bob McMullan, the 
Australian minister for trade and administrative services, 
analyzed several subjects to be included on the agenda of the 
Cairns Group meeting that will be held in Montevideo on 18 May, 
especially the problems that Canada's subsidies create in the 
international market. 
  Both officials also discussed trade and technological 
exchanges between both countries since Argentina may be able to 
offer Australia training and modernization services. Another 
subject broached at the meeting was animal health and its 
relation with the concept of regionalization (disease-free 
areas) recently approved by the GATT. 
  Sola and McMullan, who is also Cairns Group chairman, were 
of 
one mind concerning the importance of making strides in the 
implementation of GATT's animal and plant health framework. 
  With regard to the Cairns Group meeting, they agreed that 
this group's new role is of paramount importance because since 
the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT's trade talks, now 
its 14 member countries will have to monitor whether countries 
abide by the Final Act agreed upon in Marrakech and will have to 
establish the basis for future negotiations on international 
agricultural and livestock trade. 
  Sola and McMullan, who arrived in Chile on 16 May, will 
leave 
for Montevideo tomorrow to attend the 14th Cairns Group meeting.

  [Text] On 17 May, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy 
attended a meeting in Sao Paulo with businessmen and Sao Paulo 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho to discuss a specific 
subject: U.S. dissatisfaction with the manner in which Brazil 
handles its wheat purchases on the international market. 
  Brazil purchases wheat from Canada, the EU, and Argentina. 
The United States argue that the Canadian wheat is subsidized 
and represents unfair competition. "Brazil must adopt an 
antidumping measure against Canada," said Espy, who occupied a 
seat in the U.S. Congress since 1986, has a long career lobbying 
[preceding word given in English] in favor of U.S. wheat 
producers, and was a member of the Agriculture and Budget 
committees since 1986. 
<H5>  Negotiated Solution </H5>
  After the meeting, Gov. Fleury Filho said the Brazilian 
Government will receive the U.S. proposal with reservations. 
"Our solution must be negotiated. Wheat purchases should be 
discussed based on some reciprocity regarding orange juice, 
shoes, and alcohol," said the governor, who believes Brazilian 
interests were not well defended during the GATT negotiations. 
  The U.S. agriculture secretary seems to be willing to leave 
Brasilia today with some results. "If the talks in Brasilia are 
satisfactory, we may include Brazil in our program of exports 
incentives," Espy said in reference to the EEP (Export 
Enhancement Program) [preceding three words in English] that, 
with subsidies, could reduce the price of U.S. wheat offered to 
Brazil. Notwithstanding, Mike Espy pointed out that the measure 
would be adopted "in coordination with Argentina" in order not 
to harm its wheat sales to Brazil.

  [Text] Political sources report that the crisis, unleashed 
in the Dominican Republic in the wake of general elections 
Monday, 16 May, which are considered fraudulent by the 
opposition, has begun to escalate. 
  The Central Electoral Board's [JEC] credibility was once 
again contested when candidate for senator (Ministro Castillo), 
of the Dominican Liberation Party [PLD] led by Juan Bosch, the 
third political force in the country, announced that he was 
considering the possibility of rejecting the elections because 
some 300,000 Haitians had reportedly voted in them. 
  The elections were also protested yesterday by the 
opposition 
Dominican Revolutionary Party, which accused the JEC and two JEC 
justices of planning a fraud. 
  Moreover, the JEC decided to recount the votes one by one, 
beginning today, and to stop the release of bulletins with 
election results.

<F P=106> [Article by Blanche Petrich] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Foreign Relations Secretary Andres Rozental 
has said here that the initiative of Senators Robert Torricelli 
and David Bonior, who oppose NAFTA, presented yesterday to the 
U.S. Congress in Washington to ensure that U.S. demands that 
Mexico accept the presence of foreign observers during the 
August election, is "unnecessary, rather unserious, and 
disqualifying in essence." 
  As he commented on the U.S. congressmen's proposals, the 
Mexican diplomat stressed the position already taken by the 
Mexican Embassy in Washington. "The nature of the Mexican 
electoral process is something that concerns neither the U.S. 
Congress nor the U.S. Government." 
  As for the concept of "foreign visitors" which the Mexican 
Congress already included in the Federal Code of Institutions 
and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe), Rozental pointed out that the 
government "so far" has not anticipated inviting any foreign 
figure or institution to witness the development of the general 
elections. "Should there be an agreement on this issue among 
the nine political parties, I am sure the government would not 
oppose it." 
  He also explained that the procedures to extend the 
invitations will "not necessarily" be accomplished through the 
Foreign Relations Secretariat. "In that case, the Federal 
Electoral Institute [IFE] and Government Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo, as IFE president [as published], must extend the 
invitations." 
  According to a document by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit, 
headed by Horacio Boneo, the Mexican Government is reportedly 
studying the possibility of authorizing "foreign visitors" who, 
it is believed, would join the group of almost 15,000 national 
observers who will verify compliance with the laws at the 94,000 
electoral booths that will open nationwide on 21 August. 
  Last week, these observers, members of a large network of 
nongovernmental organizations grouped under the Observation 94 
Civic Alliance, agreed with the United Nations to set up a 
mechanism to receive training and counsel from the UN Electoral 
Assistance Unit. 
  Meanwhile, the process to reform Cofipe to allow the 
presence 
of "foreign visitors" ended on 13 May, as the Congress 
unanimously approved the inclusion of this new concept in 
Mexican legislation. The only thing left to do is to include the 
definition, responsibilities, and limitations of these 
"visitors" in the regulating law. 
  So far, only the Confederation of Industrial Chambers has 
planned to invite some foreign institutions, including the 
commission headed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, as 
"visitors." It is expected political parties will hand out 
their own invitations to similar institutions and personalities. 
  The Bonior-Torricelli initiative, which is based on the 
concept that NAFTA must foster a spirit of "familiarity" among 
its three members in all fields, including politics and 
democracy, failed to receive the endorsement to be presented to 
the U.S. House of Representatives. It seems only 14 
representatives are supporting it, and the Foreign Affairs 
Committee is refusing to back it. 
  "I have the impression that in addition to a few 
Mexico-bashers [previous word published in English] there, no 
further support is going to be found; Bonior and Torricelli will 
achieve nothing." The deputy secretary stressed that the 
wording of the initiative by these two Democratic congressmen 
has "meddling undertones," and it is completely fruitless. 
  "The U.S. Government, even Bill Clinton himself, has 
supported all efforts made so far to improve the electoral 
process and, above all, the foreign observation issue, which we 
are resolving on our own [motu propio]. This 
Torricelli play does not even help." 
  The duo had previously presented several initiatives on 
Mexico. The two of them were very active in opposing NAFTA 
because they thought Mexico lacked the merits to become a 
privileged member of the northern hemisphere. Recently, they 
attempted to encourage Congress to discuss the Chiapas conflict. 
  "I feel Torricelli, with his Cuban perceptions on his back, 
is very resentful because he failed to convince our government 
to support his anti-Cuban policies," said the deputy secretary. 
As for Bonior, "this is his revenge for failing to halt NAFTA." 
The thing "is that neither of them knows Mexico, and it shows."

  [Text] Panama City, 19 May (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Jose 
Raul Mulino today reported that the Panamanian Government has 
approved the appointment of Robert Pastor, whom U.S. President 
Bill Clinton will name to replace Deane Hinton at the U.S. 
Embassy in Panama City. 
  Mulino told AFP that Panama has already approved Robert 
Pastor, 47, who is considered a specialist in Latin American 
affairs. Ambassador Deane Hinton, who retired in 1993, was 
appointed in the aftermath of the 1989 U.S. invasion that 
overthrew General Manuel Antonio Noriega. U.S. Charge 
d'Affaires Oliver Garza temporarily replaced Hinton.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 19 May (NA) -- Today, members of 
the Health Committee of the Chamber of Deputies rejected the 
pressure being applied by U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James 
Cheek, seeking to force a rapid approval of the Pharmaceutical 
Patents Law. 
  The diplomat met with congressmen. After the meeting, he 
again directly threatened Argentina with trade sanctions because 
Congress is delaying the debate of the bill. 
  Thus, Cheek formulated three similar warnings in less than 
24 
hours in what appears to be a clear offensive to get the bill 
approved before the last day of June. [passage omitted] 
  Radical Civic Union Ernesto Algaba told journalists 
accredited to Congress that the deputies will not accept "any 
pressure or threat from the United States." Algaba once again 
conditioned any debate to an agreement within the terms agreed 
during the GATT round of talks. 
  He believes this agreement could be ready within 90 days for 
approval by Congress, and if this were to be fulfilled, "our 
bloc is willing to debate the patents law, which we oppose in 
its current version." 
  The meeting was informal because it was held at the office 
of 
Santa Fe Province Deputy Horacio Usandizaga and not at the 
Health Committee offices. [passage omitted] 
  Radical congressmen Algaba said the proposed goals "are 
difficult to achieve." Deputy Alejandro Armendriz added: 
"Congressional schedules must be respected, without any external 
pressure, so we can improve the law pertaining to this important 
matter." 
  Despite all these assertions, Ambassador Cheek left his 
first 
meeting with the Radical congressmen in a very happy mood.

  [Text] Expressing his agreement with an opinion voiced by 
U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia Charles Bowers, Social Defense 
National Secretary Mario Solis noted that so far, Law 1008 has 
achieved good results and met its goal of struggling against 
drug trafficking. Solis was referring to remarks made in Sucre 
by U.S. Ambassador Charles Bowers, who noted that Law 1008 is a 
"fair and good" instrument. 
  At odds with the citizenry's nearly unanimous position that 
this law should be changed, Ambassador Bowers prefers the 
implementation of the law to remain unchanged. 
  For his part, Mario Solis emphasized that Law 1008 has met 
its goal and become a key element in the war being waged against 
the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  Nevertheless, Solis indicated that now it is necessary "to 
improve" this legal instrument through a total consensus 
involving all social groups of the population. Solis added that 
this improvement is closely linked to the amendments that might 
be implemented, based on the experiences gathered so far. 
  Asked about the possible approval of a decree regulating the 
legal marketing and industrialization of coca leaves, Solis said 
he is satisfied because this government measure will benefit 
coca producers. Solis added: "This is a good regulation that 
approves coca industrialization only in areas that traditionally 
have produced it."

  [Text] President Itamar Franco said the approval of the URV 
[Real Value Unit] Provisional Measure will allow the government 
to continue its program to combat inflation. Upon leaving the 
Gloria Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, President Itamar Franco said 
national congressmen demonstrated maturity by approving 
Provisional Measure No. 482, which creates the URV, on 18 May. 
According to the president, it was an important step forward for 
the Brazilian economy's stabilization. Itamar Franco said this 
economic plan has not been imposed from top to bottom but was 
debated by the whole society, especially with the national 
Congress, which suggested almost 50 amendments. This is why the 
provisional measure will yield what we all want: curbing 
inflation. 
  [Begin Franco recording] It would be very easy for my 
administration, or the end of my administration, to abandon our 
efforts to curb inflation. It would be very easy to let the next 
president carry out this work. We still want to combat inflation 
during this administration. Congress' approval, last night, was 
very important and very significant. [end recording] 
  The president did not want to comment on Congress' dismissal 
of Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro during the same Congress session that 
approved Provisional Measure No. 482. According to the 
president, this subject pertains only to Congress.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo with </F>
domestic reporters and unidentified moderator, at the Narino 
Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Gaviria] ...obey the judicial decision. Not only 
do I not agree with the decision, but I believe that the effect 
will be serious. Consumption of substances that create 
addiction cannot be part of the behavior condoned as part of the 
free development of personality. Legislators must be given the 
option to ban and punish this, according to his criteria. 
  The government does not share the court's extremely 
individualistic interpretation of the Constitution in matters 
related not only to individual autonomy but also to obligations 
established in the Constitution. The government considers it 
its duty to promote the necessary decisions to fill the void and 
mistakes that might result from the court's decision. 
Immediately, using authority derived from laws now in effect, 
the government will issue decrees to prohibit and confirm 
prohibitions on the possession and consumption of drugs and 
psychotropic and hallucinatory substances in at least the 
following places and events: public places, places open to the 
public, schools, and places of work. Drugs will be banned among 
minors, pregnant women, drivers of vehicles, ships, or 
airplanes, those who bear firearms, and those in certain 
professions, such as doctors and dentists. 
  Likewise, we intend to establish penalties for violations of 
some of the preceding prohibitions, according to each case and 
the seriousness of the misdemeanor. The penalties will range 
from arrest, closure of public places, suspension of flight 
licenses, cancellation of work contracts, suspension or firing 
of public workers, deportation of foreigners, cancellation of 
firearm permits, and the suspension of licenses or professional 
cards. 
  The government reiterates that topics of such importance 
must 
take into account what the people have to say, thus the 
government calls on all Colombian society -- political parties, 
churches, economic associations, workers, peasants, social and 
community organizations, the academic community, parents and 
youths -- to present, together with the government, a draft bill 
with popular initiative to call a referendum to modify the 
Constitution to clearly establish the prevalence of the general 
interest, the possibility of penalizing citizens for not 
fulfilling their duties, and clearly stating the legislators' 
prerogative to ban and prohibit the consumption of drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  In the next few weeks, the president will call on 
representatives of the various institutions and organizations 
mentioned to form promotional committees and begin the necessary 
formalities for a popular legislative initiative. Given the 
reaction in the last few days, the national government is 
certain that it is correctly interpreting the feelings of all 
Colombians in support of the fight against drug trafficking and 
preventing youths from Colombia and the rest of the world from 
falling into the claws of today's most damaging perversity -- 
drug consumption. 
  I am ready for your questions. 
  [Moderator] First, we have Azucena Lievano from the "24 
Hours 
Newscast." Due to a time limit, we ask that reporters ask only 
one question. 
  [Lievano] Mr. President, in the court's decision, the 
magistrates also spoke of the need for the state to establish 
measures or ways to educate Colombians on this. What decisions 
will the government make to teach people not to take drugs? 
  [Gaviria] My suggestion was against the emotional part of 
the 
ruling, about which the government is very concerned. If the 
government accepts the emotional part of the Constitutional 
Court's ruling, this would mean that because citizens have a 
right to take drugs, campaigns against drug consumption 
themselves could be called into question at any time. In fact, 
if the emotional part of the sentence were accepted, it could 
serve as a basis for the judge to rule in favor of a petition 
for protection and say that not even antidrug campaigns are a 
legitimate civil right. 
  The government is very, very concerned about the effects of 
the Constitutional Court's decision. But it is even more 
concerned about what motivated this sentence making drug 
consumption a civil right. This is very risky for society. It 
endangers the very campaigns that society, other institutions, 
and the government are waging in an attempt to convince 
Colombians, especially the younger generation, not to take 
drugs. This is because of the enormous risk this poses to an 
individual's development and to peaceful coexistence. The 
effect this has had in developing a society with healthy 
citizens, forming healthy citizens, and not citizens who are 
addicts, not persons with habits [words indistinct] that the 
justices of the Constitutional Court have now considered as a 
personal right. This will cause great harm to individuals and 
society. 
  [Moderator] Diana Mateu, from Radio Santa Fe. 
  [Mateu] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Some nations have 
criticized Colombia's position on drug consumption as it seems 
to change so much. There is also the confrontation between 
powers that seems to favor a trend toward the decriminalization 
of drugs; something that the government of course opposes. Do 
you think that this could have repercussions on future relations 
with the United States? 
  [Gaviria] I believe this is basically an internal problem. I 
have never seen it as a problem with the international 
community. I see it as a matter that concerns Colombians alone. 
I have been witness to the Colombian community's almost 
unanimous reaction against the possibility that drugs could be 
used freely in Colombia. What is more, that decision almost 
exalts drug consumption; it is full justification for citizens 
to take drugs. This terrifies us. I do not believe one must 
[word indistinct] or tolerate international implications. 
  Let me take this opportunity to indicate that in other 
nations where [words indistinct] to say that drug consumption 
has been depenalized, let me say that in no country has this 
become a civil right. It is as if a specific antisocial 
behavior is considered [words indistinct] without the need to 
[words indistinct] that conduct of a penal nature. It is to 
that extent that there has been certain tolerance for accepting 
personal doses for drug consumption. It has not occurred to 
anyone to make this a civil right. [words indistinct] 
antisocial behavior. Right now, in no nation in the world, with 
the exception of Colombia, is drug consumption considered normal 
conduct or as an aspect of the development of an individual's 
personality. No, not at all. In all the nations of the world, 
drug consumption is a considered antisocial behavior. In some 
nations, in the vast majority, this incurs penal sanctions. 
There are some nations where there are no penal sanctions, but 
drug consumption is considered antisocial behavior, a behavior 
that should be dealt with as a health problem. [Words 
indistinct] civilian sector favors not penalizing drug 
consumption, but it is something totally different to turn drug 
consumption into a civil right. 
  [Moderator] A question from Flora Ines Torres. 
  [Torres] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Are you not playing 
your last card by calling for a referendum this close to the end 
of your administration? In addition, you need the votes of 5 
million Colombians. What is your opinion? 
  [Gaviria] I am acting in accordance with my duties. [Words 
indistinct] with my political nature. I believe I am behaving 
as most Colombians expect me to. We would have wanted to hold 
this referendum sooner. Due to the ruling's character, we have 
determined that most of the -- should we say -- limitations that 
could be established could be done by decree. To avert the 
constitutional consequences, however, and to try to avoid having 
this type of interpretation of the Constitution prevail, we have 
to modify the Constitution. 
  We believe the law that will be proposed to Congress on 
holding a referendum should come from a popular initiative, and 
we hope, in the coming days, to form a group to follow all 
procedures regarding the law on mechanisms for participation 
that will be sanctioned next week. We are only waiting for the 
signatures of some congressional chamber presidents because, as 
the Constitutional Court stipulates, Congress establishes the 
requirement that a popular initiative law must call a referendum. 
  I would also like to point out that, based on our 
consultations, our interpretation of the Constitution, and the 
law on mechanisms for participation, our opinion is that this 
referendum cannot take place concurrently with an election. It 
could not be held either during the first elections, the runoff 
elections, or possibly in the upcoming October elections. That 
referendum would have to be held on a separate date. We have 
not set a date for referendum nor have we agreed on its content 
because we want to reach a consensus with the sectors that come 
with us to collect the signatures. We want to get back on 
course and present this to the Congress during its regular 
sessions in June or in the sessions that are to start on 20 July. 
  We believe it would not be appropriate to present it before 
the law on mechanisms for participation is passed, or before 
hearing the views of the other sectors on which we have called. 
We will begin consultations next week in order to form a group 
of people to negotiate a popular intiative law with the 
Congress. I am positive we will be able to gather the 800,000 
signatures required to make this a popular initiative law. I 
have confidence we will collect several million signatures for 
Congress so that it becomes aware of what Colombians want. 
  [Moderator] Here is William Parra. 
  [Parra] Mr. President, why had we not heard until now about 
the government's reaction to this Constitutional Court decision? 
Why did the government not respond while the suit was pending? 
What justification can President Gaviria give Colombians when 
he strongly promoted the Constitution and now he wants to reform 
it? As the Constitutional Court president said yesterday, it's 
like having a new dress and changing it [words indistinct] three 
months later. 
  [Gaviria] First, I believe you did not listen to the 
statement I made the day after the Court's decision. I believe 
Colombians are clear on the fact that their government and their 
president reacted to the Court's decision. I do not believe my 
statement today is any different from the one I made at that 
time [two-minute break in reception] that our Constitution 
embraces fundamental rights, which have no limitations and must 
not be compared to these other rights. 
  Somehow, this is what is behind the Constitutional Court's 
decision [word indistinct] because obviously that was not the 
feeling of the four magistrates who cast a dissenting vote, thus 
responding to the arguments and motivations with which the 
majority of Constitutional Court magistrates reached this 
decision. 
  [Moderator] The next question is from Ricaro Canon from "The 
Noon" newscast. After that will be Jairo Gomez. 
  [Canon] Mr. President, as long as this decision is in 
effect, 
what position and actions will the government adopt to repress 
and penalize drug consumption and trafficking? Do you consider, 
as you pointed out, that the Constitutional Court's decision can 
be overturned by decree? 
  [Gaviria] No. No. We cannot overturn the Court's ruling by 
issuing a decree because it will violate the Constitution. 
Because the ruling has a paragraph that includes the same 
guidelines, decrees, and laws of previous police corps, we will 
establish some of the limitations that the Court believes are 
reasonable and could be established. The essence of the ruling, 
however -- drug consumption in Colombia -- will not be banned. 
This is a basic right that cannot be curtailed by issuing a 
decree. The only way we can curtail that right, should we want 
to, is to amend our Constitution by means of following the 
amendment procedures stipulated in the Constitution itself. 
  [Moderator] Next question is by Jairo Gomez from the "Seven 
O'Clock Newscast", followed by Antonio Jose Caballero. 
  [Gomez] Mr. President, according to the proposal you have 
just made, there will undoubtedly be a need for many steps, and 
most surely it will not be taken into account before your 
administration ends on 7 August. Why did you not leave this to 
the new president of the Republic? 
  [Gaviria] Well, for one thing, the new president of the 
Republic would have proceeded with this issue as he saw fit. I 
do not want to get involved in the decisions the new president 
would adopt. I am going to issue the decree and take the 
initiative in asking citizens to express their opinions. I 
believe that it was not only the president's opinion which I 
expressed in the early hours of the day after the Court's 
decision. In this respect, with regard to the next government, 
he will proceed as he deems appropiate. I believe that as a 
result of the Colombian people's generalized frame of mind with 
respect to this issue, the next president's government will work 
to have the people express an opinion on this issue. If we had 
had a president-elect now, I could have consulted him about the 
issue. Since we do not, I believe it is my responsibility to 
uphold the Colombian people's desire to keep working to prevent 
this situation -- which is of a legal nature -- from taking 
hold. This is the case not only because of what it represents, 
as far as drug consumption goes, which a great majority of 
Colombians reject, but also for other reasons that could become 
a reality if this type of decision prevails in Colombian society 
as an interpretation of the Constitution. 
  [Moderator] Here is Antonio Jose Caballero of RCN, and 
(?Clemente Dominguez) gets ready to ask his question. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, once again we hear the expression 
I abide by but do not agree with in this explanation of the 
Colombian state branches. The prosecutor general [words 
indistinct] through the Constitutional Court. What is the 
government most concerned about? The image of Colombians abroad 
or the health and well-being of people here? 
  [Gaviria] With regard to what the prosecutor general thinks 
of the Constitutional Court's decision, that is something you 
would have to ask him, whether this was the sort of legalization 
he was proposing or something different, or whether he had 
another proposal to make to Colombia and the international 
community. I would prefer not to interpret the prosecutor 
general's view. I have clearly stated that I am concerned about 
this situation's impact at home, not for its impact abroad. I 
am fundamentally concerned about its impact at home on the 
health of Colombians, the social cohesion of Colombians, the 
need to punish the antisocial behavior in Colombian society. It 
concerns me whether it is advisable for Colombian society to be 
able to demand that drug abusers undergo medical treatment so 
that Colombian society can punish anyone who is a repeat drug 
abuser if he does not undergo medical treatment and give up 
drugs. These circumstances make this a serious matter. 
  Reaction abroad does not seem essential to me. Citizens' 
reaction, parents and young people, reflects concern for our 
children, our young people, and our society. I have not seen 
anyone worry about the consequences abroad. In fact, I do not 
think there will be consequences abroad. We have to focus on 
the impact this has on our families, our children, and our 
society. 
  [Moderator] Here to ask a question is (?Clemente Dominguez) 
of Todelar. Samuel Salazar of Caracol Radio gets ready to ask 
his question. 
  [Dominguez] Mr. President, why do you insist on a referendum 
rather than on a bill, as the Constitutional Court said, and why 
not include the proposal for an educational campaign for drug 
abusers since experts feel drug addiction is a kind of illness? 
  [Gaviria] Regarding the first issue, I would like to say the 
decree we will issue will in no way take the place of a 
statutory law that establishes limitations mentioned by the 
Court's decision. The Court said these are police norms, and we 
believe that by gathering a large amount of norms from the 
Minors Code and other kinds of legislation to which we will 
refer next, when we issue the decree, we will be able to 
establish those limitations. But we are concerned about the 
motivation behind the sentence, not so much about the decision 
that we can criminalize drug consumption, since what concerns me 
the most is motivation. 
  Why are we concerned about motivation, and why do I insist 
on 
this? We are concerned about motivation because it has turned 
drug consumption not into antisocial behavior that will not be 
penalized but into a civil right. These are two very different 
things. It is true that some societies have come to the 
conclusion that they do not want to penalize drug consumption or 
personal drug doses. No society, however, has said that drug 
consumption is not antisocial conduct. This is something 
exclusive to Colombian society and our Constitutional Court. 
Holland, Germany, Italy, (?Spain), and some U.S. states did not 
do this. That is not true. Drug consumption in all those 
countries is antisocial conduct. It is antisocial conduct. In 
some countries, it is punished by law, and in others it is not, 
but in all of them it is antisocial behavior. But here, our 
Court, in an interpreation that we described as excessively 
individualistic, has ruled that drug consumption is not 
antisocial behavior but actually a right. I think it does 
serious harm to Colombian society to coexist with that theory, 
with that underlying idea of the development of personality, 
which deep down... [pauses] In some way we agree with the 
dissenting opinion that showed this undermines life and the very 
argument used by the Court. It undermines human dignity, the 
development of personality, and social coexistence. 
  [Moderator] Here to ask a question is Samuel Salazar of 
Caracol Radio, and Pablo Arturo Paez gets ready. 
  [Salazar] [Words indistinct] [Ninenteen-second break in 
reception for station identification by station announcer] 
  [Gaviria] ...an arbitrary arrest. We could decide to 
arrest a driver for having taken drugs. We believe this conduct 
is evidently damaging to society. In addition, we would have to 
consider other than simple penalties. We believe such conduct 
warrants an arrest and our Constitution foresees it [words 
indistinct] not been declared as invalid by the Court. We 
believe that anyone who takes drugs in public places can be 
subject to arrest, more so if we are referring to any Public 
Force member. Quite frankly, I plan to fight with all my energy 
to prevent Colombian society from falling prey to situations 
where, for example, Public Force members or even doctors, take 
drugs right in front of their patients, or perform surgery while 
under the influence of drugs. I firmly believe that such 
conduct warrants an arrest. Don't you agree? 
  [Moderator] The following question is from Carlos Arturo 
Paez 
from [word indistinct] followed by Ana Fernanda Valderrama. 
  [Paez] Mr. President, the Constitutional Court's majority 
decision was made by taking Article 16 of the Constitution into 
consideration. When reading this article we notice that this 
article is very broad and difficult to regulate. Does the 
government have its own initiative as to what and how this 
article should be regulated? 
  [Gaviria] Most surely it is an article very difficult to 
regulate. Except for cases involving drug consumption, we have 
found no other angle to develop the article as part of a 
statutory law. We have thought -- and this would be one of the 
issues we would propose to the group working on the People's 
Initiative Law -- to include a proposal to add several 
paragraphs to the article establishing that the lawmaker can 
determine penalties, inclusive of criminal penalties, not only 
against those who take drugs under certain circumstances such as 
the ones I just mentioned. Most of all, to determine penalties 
even for those who take drugs on a personal basis. 
  [Moderator] Last question from Ana Fernanda Valderrama from 
"National Newscast." 
  [Valderrama] Mr. President, good afternoon. Through a 
decree, you plan to tell the Colombian people, as well as the 
country's mayors, that they are not allowed to take drugs in 
public places. You plan to tell doctors that they cannot do it 
in front of their patients. What everyone is wondering, 
however, is that most surely the people are going to do it in 
private and it is not going to be restricted to the average 
citizen, but it will also spread, even government workers. Do 
you not believe that this could foment the double morality 
standards already existing in the country? 
  [Gaviria] Of course, however, that is not as result of the 
decree the government is going to issue. It is a repercussion 
of the ruling by the Constitutional Court. I think we all 
agree, and I think that on this the Constitutional Court also 
agrees, that Colombians have the right to consume drugs but that 
there must be limitations. Which limitations? There are 
limitations on situations that endanger social coexistence, 
solidarity, and social order. Those limitations will 
undoubtedly have to be established anyway. Just imagine a 
society that condones situations such as a pilot flying an 
aircraft, or a driver under the influence of drugs. Situations 
such as those represent a peril to social order. I feel 
obligated -- regardless of the inconsistencies you just 
mentioned -- to issue a decree that includes those legal 
provisions. Thank you all.

  [Text] Montevideo, 19 May (EFE) -- Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu today denied that his country will 
participate in an eventual American force that will take action 
in Haiti, and he ratified that his country does not support an 
armed intervention in that Caribbean country. 
  Abreu made his country's position known after some foreign 
media asserted that only Argentina and Uruguay were willing to 
participate in a multinational force in Haiti. 
  The U.S. State Department asked the opinion of several OAS 
member countries on the creation of a multinational force to 
dislodge the military in power in Haiti. 
  The majority of Latin American countries opposes this idea, 
which is one of three being studied in Washington. The other 
ideas include direct intervention by the United States and the 
creation of a force made up of Haitian refugees. 
  Uruguay has promoted political actions in the OAS in order 
to 
prevent the Haitian crisis from turning into a military solution. 
  Abreu stated that the country's position has not changed and 
it will work with "preventive diplomacy." 
  The foreign minister said Uruguay "is a jealous defender of 
nonintervention and the self-determination of nations." 
  "Uruguay will support all solutions that come within the 
framework of international law and the responsible 
organizations," Abreu reiterated. "The principles of 
nonintervention and self-determination are not negotiable," he 
stressed.

  [Excerpts] Ramon Escovar Salom, former prosecutor general 
and current interior minister, said that the trial of former 
President Carlos Andres Perez is an example for Latin America. 
Escovar spoke at length with reporters after a Council of 
Ministers meeting on 18 May. [passage omitted] 
  As Venezuelans we should be pleased that the country's 
institutions behaved in the way they have, that it is possible 
to try a president, that we can hold public officials 
accountable for their actions, and that the Constitution is not 
an insignificant book in practical life, but a set of rules that 
have a bearing on the country's life. What has transpired is not 
an act of revenge or persecution against a president, but the 
result of formal charges filed by a prosecutor general and a 
formal and concrete ruling by the CSJ [Supreme Court of Justice]. 
  I have nothing more to add; I only want to urge people who 
sympathize with the former president to act responsibly and to 
spare the country from actions that might stem from an 
accumulation of feelings of revenge and also spare the country 
from the use of violence, because neither is in keeping with the 
serenity shown by the institutions. Calls to settle accounts 
with all those involved in this trial are absolutely 
irreconcilable with the country's dignity and the strength of 
Venezuelan democratic institutions. I want to talk to them 
calmly, because apparently there are already voices that are 
trying to distort the court ruling and this exemplary process 
that the Venezuelan people have accepted as their own and that 
democrats of Latin America and the world view as a reflection of 
the strength of Venezuelan institutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Tatiana Rothschild] </F>
  [Text] Juigalpa, Chontales -- Here in a meeting with 
congressmen and guests of the extraordinary congress that will 
take place this weekend in Managua, Commander Daniel Ortega 
Saavedra said that "the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] candidate who emerges from the consensus is going to be 
the unity candidate." Ortega confirmed to Chontales Department 
congressmen his pledge to "respect the congress results even if 
they do not agree with the positions we are defending from the 
rank and file." 
  Ortega regretted having to compete for the post of secretary 
general with Commander Henry Ruiz and considered that those who 
try to run down or alter the principles that have guided the 
FSLN are gaining from the conflict. The current FSLN secretary 
general recognized Commander Ruiz as the revolutionary leader 
who historically has maintained leftist positions and expressed 
surprise that those who lean toward social democracy have taken 
shelter under Ruiz' candidacy. Ortega said "any Sandinist can 
have this aspiration, but the grassroots, who demand unity 
around popular struggles, must be the ones to define the party 
we want." 
  Peasant leader Celestino Garcia demanded it be noted clearly 
on the record that the launching of Commander Henry Ruiz' 
candidacy by Chontales Department Political Secretary Luis 
Enrique Figueroa was in Figueroa's capacity as a Sandinist 
follower. 
  Benedicto Miranda, Sandinist Youth department coordinator, 
questioned the role of journalists, who have assumed the task of 
deepening the trends rather than highlighting the party's 
platform program.

  [Text] Sandinists consulted by EL NUEVO DIARIO have 
criticized Commander Tomas Borge's statements to a local radio 
station yesterday, for what they called "a one-sided 
interpretation" in the sense that Borge is trying to get the 
results of the so-called departmental assemblies to serve as a 
mandate for representatives to the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] Congress. 
  It is no secret that the immense majority of the 
departmental 
assemblies, which are being held prior to the special session of 
the Sandinist Congress, have been ad hoc assemblies without any 
type of statutory legitimacy, except in two or three departments 
where congresses were really held. 
  Anyway, according to the congress representatives who were 
consulted, if any document can be taken as a reference point for 
voting in the special session, it would be the documents that 
resulted from consultations with the rank and file, not the ones 
from these assemblies because most of the latter were so 
outrageous that they resolved exactly the contrary of what the 
rank and file had decided. 
  According to Tomas Borge, former President Daniel Ortega won 
a majority of votes at all those "legitimate party assemblies" 
to continue being the secretary general of the Sandinist Front. 
In this respect and according to his figures, Daniel obtained 
1,198 votes; followed by Borge himself with 1,180; and in third 
place, Monica Baltodano with 1,112; and Commander Henry Ruiz 
with 1,092 votes. 
  The Sandinists consulted have asserted that Borge's 
statements are "an attack against the secret vote of the 
national congressmen." They warned against "shallow, one-sided 
interpretations" of their followers' votes and noted that the 
true accounting will follow when the national representatives to 
the FSLN Congress cast their personal and secret votes. 
  Borge thinks the results and decisions of the assemblies 
have 
to be transferred to the Congress. "Each one has to be faithful 
to the mandate of the rank and file. If not, it would be a 
betrayal, a felony," the former interior minister said in 
reference to the issue. 
  But the Sandinists, who reacted shortly after Borge's 
statements, asserted that Tomas is trying to suspend the 
Congress and is implying that the results of the voting at the 
assemblies take the place of the special session. They added 
that this is nothing more than "another sign of the desperation 
created by Commander Ruiz's candidacy for secretary general." 
This is all as untrue as the idea that someone in the rank and 
file has asked him to be secretary general, they added. 
  Their desperation has gone so far that Borge, joining the 
chorus of slurs, has indicated that Ruiz is the candidate of the 
rightists and reactionaries. "I would not like to be a 
candidate backed by the spokesmen of right-wing sectors," Borge 
said, implying that such spokesmen supported Ruiz in an effort 
to divide the FSLN or because they felt Commander Ruiz 
represented them.

  [Text] Commander Henry Ruiz proposed unity beyond the 
Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] in order to attain 
the unity of the Nicaraguan people and win the 1996 elections. 
Ruiz made the statement in the Monimbo neighborhood of Masaya 
one day after announcing his candidacy for the FSLN secretary 
generalship. 
  At a preparatory meeting for the FSLN Special Congress, Ruiz 
urged Sandinists to elect a secretary general who will promote a 
strong party. He urged them to choose "a secretary general who 
represents unity, not bands or gangs," because that would turn 
the FSLN into a minority party." 
  Ruiz stressed that all FSLN members are revolutionaries and 
leftists. It is not as some people "have been saying over the 
past two days, that there are Sandinists on the right and the 
left." 
  In a speech before some 200 Sandinists at the Minimbo 
gymnasium, Ruiz said he is "totally convinced that unity is the 
only solution" for Sandinists. 
  Ruiz, who is known as Modesto among the Sandinists, said 
that 
this unity is urgent. "While we are here talking, (Managua 
Mayor Arnaldo) Aleman is creating an army of between 40,000 to 
50,000 activists. What are we doing in the meantime?" he asked. 
  "If we are defeated (in 1996), it will be because we are 
divided while they are united and working together," he warned. 
Ruiz, who is also FSLN treasurer and member of the Ethics 
Commission, said the renewal of the FSLN is necessary because 
Nicaraguan society is becoming more democratic every day. 
  "The FSLN's renewal is not treason; it is a revolutionary 
step. Anyone who takes a defensive stance is not on the right 
track," Ruiz noted. 
  This renewal process, however, requires one line of ethics, 
Ruiz added. "A revolutionary cannot have a set of ethics 
different from those held by his party," he stressed. 
  Those ethics should be based on peace and should help 
resolve 
the problem known as "la pinata," an aspect that Ruiz described 
as an ethical flaw that "stains the Sandinist record." 
  "Ideas cannot be fought by disqualification," Ruiz said, 
demanding an open and fair debate among Sandinists. "I am still 
opposed to the use of dirty methods in the debates," he 
stressed. "If this is what happens on the eve of the 
convocation, what can be expected at the Congress party?" Ruiz 
asked those present, among them Deputies Doris Tijerino, William 
Ramirez, Danilo Aguirre, and Julio Marenco. 
  During his visit to Masaya, Ruiz said he favors keeping the 
National Directorate name, which can be expanded and renewed to 
maintain some historical factors and ensure continuity. At the 
same time, he said the current trends "will be dissolved if we 
find the correct solutions for our problems." 
  He also noted his contributions to the debates among the 
Sandinists, to which the National Directorate was opposed. "We 
are glad we supported those trends (of opinion) because now we 
have the opportunity to discuss our views," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo 
virtually proclaimed his presidential candidacy for the 1996 
elections. He did so on Radio Ya when speaking in favor of an 
organization he called "Democratic Convergence." 
  During his extended interview, he said the political right 
"is trying to glamorize former President Daniel Ortega so he, 
who is politically depleted, will run in the 1996 elections and 
lose and they, the right, will win. But," he cautioned, "they 
are forgetting about us -- the Democratic Center." 
  The announcement was made when Carlos Guadamuz, director of 
that radio station, asked Lacayo if he will run as the head of 
the convergence, to which Lacayo also refers as the Center. The 
minister answered: "One word to the wise is sufficient." 
Lacayo said: If this Convergence "believes I am the person 
who has led the country's economy down a good road" and decides 
to nominate me, "I will not evade this task." 
  He then noted that what is important is that the political 
center win. He positioned the government of Violeta Chamorro, 
who does not belong to any party, in this center. The Chamorro 
administration was born of a 14-party alliance. 
  Lacayo said the political center will "choose the best 
Nicaraguan for the 1996 candidacy" and that as long as there is 
a centrist government, the right does not stand a chance of 
winning the 1996 elections." 
  Lacayo noted, as he did two weeks ago in Mateare, that the 
people do not want "the liberal-Somozist option" or the 
Sandinists to win the elections because the country would be 
polarized. The presidency minister said that a centrist 
government is necessary to "control the extreme right and the 
extreme left." 
  According to Lacayo, Democratic Convergence must not 
function 
on the basis of personalities, "as this would generate division 
and jealousy and because the work must not favor any particular 
candidate, even if the candidate is Antonio Lacayo."

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Larios] </F>
  [Text] Last week in Washington, the government concluded 
negotiations on the agreements known as ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility] and ERC-II [expansion unknown], 
after succesfully obtaining $27.5 million in loans on top of 
those that the World Bank and the IMF had already approved for a 
total of $259 million. Finance Minister Emilio Pereira reported 
this yesterday at a news conference. 
  Given that the negotiations concluded last week, Pereira 
described as "extraordinary" the fact that the first 
disbursements "will not come from originally budgeted resources, 
but from those that were allocated to four African countries 
that failed to implement their economic programs and left intact 
the $120 million the World Bank had budgeted for the next three 
years." 
  The first loan disbursement -- about $67 million in support 
of the balance of payments -- will be made on 24 June. The 
agreements will be ratified at board of directors meetings at 
the World Bank on 21 June and at the IMF between 22 and 30 June. 
  Pereira reported that besides reviewing the loan contracts, 
the Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington has been authorized to 
sign the loan contracts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Government 
as soon as the board meetings end. These loans will be used 
immediately to pay for imports made since January. The Central 
Bank is already lining up import bills, up to a maximum of $20 
million, in order to pay them as soon as the loans are disbursed. 
  The IMF and the World Bank "gave their full approval" to the 
letters of intent sent by the government, Pereira added. He 
said that the World Bank's Nicaragua Consultative Group will 
meet on 16 June in Paris. The meeting will focus exclusively on 
Nicaragua. The discussion on Honduras and Guatemala has been 
suspended "because those countries failed to implement their 
economic programs on schedule," the minister said. 
<H5>  Consultative Group's Agenda </H5>
  The agenda approved for the Consultative Group's meeting 
includes a review of the progress thus far and a review of the 
1994 plan. The second session will analyze the medium-term 
agenda, 1995-96, when Nicaragua will try to secure additional 
development resources. 
  Finally, at the closing session, "before the countries say 
how much they will contribute to support us, we will discuss the 
government's priority programs and will focus on social programs 
to ease poverty and on a program to reform the public sector," 
Pereira added. The minister said that World Bank President Dr. 
Preston and the President for Latin America Dr. Burky will visit 
Nicaragua in September. 
  The government committed itself to continue implementing the 
ESAF and to immediately issue three decrees, the first 
eliminating ministers' discretionary power to issue fiscal 
decrees, the second requiring the government to publish such 
decrees in the official newspaper LA GACETA, and the third 
abolishing taxes on luxury goods and on selective consumption, 
replacing them with a temporary protection tariff and a specific 
consumption tax. 
  The government also committed itself to "fully promote" the 
privatization of Nicaraguan Telecomunications and Postal 
Services Institute. This process is expected to conclude in 
September. A bill will be introduced in the National Assembly 
for this purpose. 
<H5>  2,000 Take Advantage of the PML [Job Mobility Plan] </H5>
  Pereira reported that 2,000 state workers have taken 
advantage of the PML since last September; 260 new applications 
were filed in the past two months. The minister said: "We see no 
problem in reaching our goal" of having about 5,000 citizens 
take advantage of this plan. In fact, "there is actually 
competition among the unions, which are asking us to "apply it 
here first." [quotation marks as published] 
  Pereira denied reports that he will be transferred to the 
Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington. "This ministry has been the 
target of many attacks since 1990, including media campaigns to 
discredit us, reports that I am sick, threats against my mother 
telling her to pick me up at a place known as Cuesta del Plomo 
at midnight, and obscene phone calls to my wife," he added. 
  The minister said such reports are part of a campaign to 
destabilize the government. "I am here to stay. I am a father, 
I have seven children and one of them has undergone seven 
open-heart operations. I returned to Nicaragua, never to leave 
again," Pereira added.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 17 May. 
  The 1993-94 coffee harvest recently ended in Nicaragua. It 
produced 920,180 quintals of coffee, which will generate exports 
of more than $58 million, the National Coffee Commission 
reported today. It represents a 27.6 percent increase over the 
previous year's harvest. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1526 GMT 4 
May 94) 
  The Nicaraguan Government, through Social Action Minister 
William Baez, has approved the "open regionalism" proposal for 
the creation of a free trade zone in the hemisphere. The 
proposal was made at a Latin American Economic Commission 
meeting in Colombia 20-27 April. Meeting participants agreed 
that economic policies need to be changed to help the poor. 
(Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 5 May 94 p 4) 
  The Nicaraguan Government cannot lower interest rates on 
bank 
loans by decree, according to the president of the Central Bank 
of Nicaragua, Dr. Jose Evenor Taboada. Taboada said that only 
by way of efficiency and productivity can the country combat 
prevailing high interest rates. (Managua Radio Nicaragua 
Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 10 May 94) 
  A total of 95 percent of the Nicaraguan population is 
unemployed. Most of these people have joined the underground 
economy, while a small percentage of them work for short periods 
of time in various occupations, according to a joint report 
issued by the private sector and the Permanent Workers Congress. 
(Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 10 May 94) 
  On 12 May, the National Assembly passed an anti-usury law 
empowering any civil judge to void any loan granted at an 
interest rate 50 percent above the rate established by the 
Central Bank. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 13 May 94 p 10) 
  On 13 May, the National Assembly voted unanimously to ratify 
the Guatemala Protocol, which will regulate free commerce among 
Central American countries. This agreement does not contain the 
specific rules of the Central American Free Trade Agreement but 
does reflect the political commitment of the Nicaraguan State to 
participate, even with the restrictions imposed on it by its 
unequal development. Deputy Economy Minister Eduardo Belli said 
the protocol represents a new development strategy based on 
economic openness. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 14 May 94 p 5) 
  On 16 May, the Nicaraguan Government asked the international 
community for an additional $180 million in aid for the next 
three years. Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo made the 
request at the opening of the meeting between the Nicaraguan 
Government, donor countries, and nongovernmental institutions 
that provide economic assistance to the country. According to 
government predictions, the GDP will grow 2 percent. (Managua 
Radio Nicaragua Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 16 May 94)

  [Text] Paris, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- On 18 May, Mexico became 
the 25th OECD member and the first Latin American country to be 
admitted into this organization, which includes the world's most 
highly industrialized nations, the OECD has reported. 
  In a communique released on 18 May, the OECD reported that 
the Mexican Government had submitted the necessary instruments 
for its admittance after completing the internal legal 
requirements demanded by the Mexican Constitution. "As of this 
date, Mexico officially is a member of the organization," the 
communique said. 
  According to OECD statutes, Mexico will be governed by the 
same economic policies applicable to the other members, the 
world's most highly developed countries. Now that Mexico has 
joined the so-called Industrialized Nations Club, Mexico will 
cease to receive assistance funds for development from the group. 
  The OECD does not establish regulations on or provide loans 
to member countries. The OECD's function is to establish 
standards, regulations, parameters, and continuity levels of 
economic development. Not long ago, the OECD also pledged to 
defend the world commercial agreements' benefits for developing 
nations, particularly within the framework of the GATT Uruguay 
Round. 
  In April, during the closing of the GATT international trade 
negotiations held in Marrakesh, Morocco, it was agreed to create 
the World Trade Organization. 
  The OECD was founded in Paris on 14 December 1960 to 
stimulate the adoption of policies aimed at improving living 
standards in member countries, attaining sustained growth, 
reducing the unemployment rate to its minimum, and ensuring 
financial stability. Other purposes are to establish policies 
for the expansion of international trade with undiscriminating 
multilateral bases, supported by international obligations with 
organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF. 
  The OECD was founded by the 12 European Union member states, 
five member countries of the European Free Trade Association, 
Turkey, Canada, and the United States. With Mexico's entry into 
the organization, the three NAFTA member countries are the only 
countries of the American continent to become OECD members. 
  The OECD member countries in Europe are: Spain, France, 
Great 
Britain, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, The 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, 
Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Austria. Members from Asia and 
Oceania are Japan, Turkey, Australia, and New Zealand. Japan 
was admitted in 1964 and Finland in 1969. New Zealand, the 
country that joined before Mexico, was admitted in 1973. 
  Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and ROK, among others, have 
expressed interest in joining, but membership is possible only 
by invitation. Of the countries that have requested admission, 
only the ROK is being considered by OECD. The organization has 
established a number of "political preconditions" to accept a 
country as a member. Such requirements include that the country 
have a democratic government and a market economy. According to 
the organization's regulations, however, the essential 
requirement is the consensus of all member states regarding the 
"guest." 
  In 1991, Mexico expressed interest in joining the OECD and 
increased its presence as an observer to the various OECD 
committees. Mexico received the official invitation on 14 April 
and on 18 May it became a full-fledged member with the duty to 
follow the standards established for the most highly 
industrialized countries. 
  A few days ago, Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello said: 
"Mexico's admission does not mean that the country will become 
rich overnight." Nevertheless, Mexico's incorporation into the 
OECD is expected to have an influence on the flow of foreign 
capital and the investors' decisions. 
  Finally, OECD economist Jean Pierre Garcon has said: "The 
fact that Mexico has been accepted with the consensus of the 
member states means that Mexico is regarded as a partner that 
can participate on an equal footing in the activities of the 
world's most highly developed countries."

  [Excerpts] Montevideo, 19 May (EFE) -- Agriculture and 
commerce ministers from 14 countries with efficient agricultural 
production began a two-day meeting in Montevideo today to review 
the Uruguay Round of GATT talks after the signing of the 
protocols in Marrakech on 15 April. 
  The meeting was opened at the Latin American Integration 
Association (ALADI) headquarters. In their initial speeches, 
the Cairns Group ministers confirmed their countries' 
willingness to play a significant role in the agricultural 
reform required by the international trade system. 
  The ministers also confirmed the task of monitoring 
compliance with the GATT agreements reached during the Uruguay 
Round, which recently ended, marked by controversy over the 
issue of agriculture, as countries of efficient production were 
pitted against the developed nations, which subsidize the 
production of agricultural commodities. [passage omitted] 
  The opening session was inaugurated by Pedro Saravia, the 
Uruguayan livestock, agriculture, and fishing minister; 
Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan; and ALADI Secretary 
General Antonio Antunes, a Brazilian citizen. 
  Antunes welcomed the participating delegations. He 
acknowledged the significance of the Uruguay Round of the GATT 
talks in achieving fairer and more stable trade standards. The 
ALADI secretary said: "The Latin American integration process is 
based on the fact that this region must competitively and 
dynamically join the world. To this effect, the multilateral 
trade system must be more honest." 
  Antunes noted that the subregional systems "are playing a 
leading role in the current Latin American integration process 
and, with their own profiles and programs, are also contributing 
to a freer and more credible multilateral trade system." Antunes 
emphasized: "The implementation and extent of the modest and 
difficult process of agricultural reform agreed upon in the 
Uruguay Round will only become apparent at the beginning of the 
21st century." In conclusion, Antunes said: "The Cairns Group's 
role and joint negotiating actions will therefore be extremely 
significant for our countries and for slowly and gradually 
opening the gates to a market without barriers and without 
discrimination." [passage omitted] 
  The Cairns Group understands that its intermediary role in 
the agricultural negotiations to reconcile the U.S. and European 
Union positions has not been fully completed.

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has said that 
tourism is a priority matter in the country's life at this 
historic moment. In a two-hour meeting with representatives, 
delegates, tour operators, and reporters attending the Cuba-94 
tourism convention, President Castro answered more than a dozen 
questions. 
  He said anything that has an impact on the economy is very 
important to the country, that tourism is one of the areas with 
the greatest impact, and that it is growing at a rate of almost 
30 percent yearly. He added that because Cuba has tourist 
potential, and especially because there is willingness to keep 
it growing, tourism is considered a priority. 
  The blockade was also among the issues discussed at the 
meeting with delegates, tour operators, and reporters from the 
tourism convention. On this matter, the commander in chief said 
President Clinton is maintaining his severity, but in a softer 
manner and with less threatening, less bellicose words. He said, 
however, that the severity of U.S. policy toward Cuba has not 
changed. It remains the same. 
  Concerning foreign investments in the country, Fidel Castro 
said the opening will be increasingly broader and that it is 
perfectly conceivable because the objective is to attain the 
means to develop the country. 
  When asked about how a socialist system can coexist with the 
flow of foreign capital, Castro said that Cuba neither will give 
up socialism nor defraud those who want to contribute to the 
development of this and other fields, such as petroleum 
exploration and exploitation. 
  Concerning the desired image for Cuba, Castro said he wants 
to convey the image of a beautiful country with natural 
conditions; a hospitable and sound nation; a well-organized, 
drug-free country with a warm climate and a high culture that 
protects the environment. 
  The 15th tourism convention gathered 971 delegates from 26 
European and American countries and representatives from Algiers 
and the Arab world. In this convention, Cuba has signed several 
contracts for the next winter and summer seasons.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has sent a complimentary note 
to NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY employees on the 20th anniversary of its 
founding. He also presided over the plenum of the National 
Committee of the Armed Forces Civilian Workers Union. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] With a heated 
opening, the meeting was a surprise to everyone from the very 
beginning. Jose Roque, Secretary General of the FAR civilian 
workers union, began by saying: Let us begin by talking about 
the beans. Debates on the principal difficulties followed. 
  The leader of the Che Guevara Military Industrial Company 
workers union assessed the losses in agriculture and promoted 
further discussions. 
  [Unidentified union leader] This loss situation must be 
solved, the farm must be closed, or we must ask for the 
resignation of the comrades involved in this activity. 
  [Reporter] The Che Guevara Company director outlined the 
agricultural goals for 1994: 
  [Director] I believe that concerning our agriculture, 
notwithstanding the costs that move us to work resolutely at the 
level of the industry and other activities, we can say that we 
are meeting the company's main needs, but that now we have to 
resolve current inefficiency. 
  [Reporter] Moreover, General Ulises Rosales del Toro 
stressed 
the idea of producing at the lowest cost possible. 
  [Rosales] You who have received the banner of our system 
must 
also be awarded in this line of production. The minister's 
guideline is that we cannot produce at any cost, and this must 
also be extended to agriculture. The idea is not only to 
guarantee 30 percent of production, but to produce in a 
reasonable manner to prevent unnecessary expenditures that will 
neutralize our productivity [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] The FAR civilian workers union includes 85,000 
workers, and at the plenum held in the presence of union leaders 
and representatives of the FAR, they discussed the basic 
activities in which the Armed Forces are engaged, for their own 
experience and for the good of the fatherland. The objective is 
to make the Armed Forces self-sufficient in foodstuffs in 1995 
and continue their contributions to the people. 
  This year, the FAR budget was reduced 50 percent. The 
structural reorganization improvement program, which began seven 
years ago, has become a generalized experience so far as 
profitability and suitability are concerned, and also concerning 
the use of human and material resources and the political work 
that support these goals. 
  [Rosales] What we are doing today in production, what we are 
doing in the fields, what we are doing in everything we are 
discussing here is showing the role we play. But this requires 
awareness, capacity, and efficiency, and this also requires 
appropriate training and guidance. 
  [Reporter] For example, a citrus fruit production farm in 
Hawaii Grande in 1993 harvested 70,000 quintals. The Youth Labor 
Army in January 1994 collected 73,000 quintals of citrus fruits 
from this same FAR. The FAR members and their civilian workers 
also played an important role in the latest potato and tomato 
harvests. 
  [Ross Leal] For all these achievements, which are also 
reflected in figures and good results, the national CTC [Cuban 
Workers Federation] decided to award the FAR the banner of labor 
deeds. [applause] 
  [Raul Castro] In a recent FAR military council, I called the 
work carried out and the results achieved over the past three 
years by the FAR, colossal. Thanks to these achievements, the 
special period has not been able to reduce our capacity or our 
fighting readiness. 
  The sudden severance of the Soviet supply and the drastic 
reduction in resources stemming from the national economy have 
not intimidated us and have not made us conform. 
  [Reporter] The FAR minister also referred to the 
participation of the civilian workers in the Armed Forces' 
achievements. He said self-supply of goods, profitability, and 
maintenance of defensive capacity are the basic pillars of work. 
He said the sixth congress of civilian workers will be held in 
1995. 
  [Raul Castro] The congress will be held in 1995, a century 
after the time when the fatherland had a new rebirth, with the 
armed uprising that achieved liberty; a century after Jose Marti 
fell in action, after the epic event of the invasion from east 
to west under Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomes. 
  Fidel has taught us how to commemorate the centennial 
anniversary of the fatherland. A hundred years after the birth 
of the apostle, he organized and led us in an attack on the 
Moncada Garrison. Let us pay a worthy tribute to the centennial 
anniversary, to those historical, sacred, and exalted moments of 
the fatherland with an exemplary congress of the civilian 
workers of the glorious Revolutionary Armed Forces. I will see 
you in the sixth congress, and perhaps long before that as well. 
Thank you. [applause]

We often hear positive and encouraging opinions everywhere

officers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces work toward 
fulfilling this mission. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Beatriz Padron from the "Evening Information Review" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are the only Latin 
American countries with nuclear installations. Right now, Cuba 
has such an installation under construction and it is fostering 
an extensive program for sustained progress in the nuclear field 
on the basis of the promotion of general progress in the nuclear 
field in area countries. 
  Under the administration of the Executive Secretariat for 
Nuclear Affairs [SEAN], Cuba's nuclear program and the 
implementation of this technology for peaceful purposes, include 
quite a few achievements in various economic and industrial 
fields. 
  Cuba makes these achievements available to other countries 
of the continent through ARCAL [Regional Cooperation 
Arrangements for the Development of Nuclear Science and 
Technology], a program sponsored by the Atomic Energy 
Organization, to contribute to the peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy in the region. Cuba has participated in 12 
projects since it joined ARCAL in 1987. 
  Let us listen to Daniel Codorniu, deputy coordinator of 
Cuba's SEAN: 
  [Begin Codorniu recording] To give you an example of the 
projects being developed, I will tell you that there is one that 
has to do with the utilization of nuclear technology for animal 
feeding and reproduction. This has to do with everything 
related to immunoanalyses for the development of livestock. 
This project is now in its fourth year. Last year, Cuba, in the 
framework of this project, conducted seminars on the diagnosis 
of brucellosis using nuclear and related technology. Four Latin 
Americans, not counting Cubans, participated in this seminar. 
  Another project being developed is one on the development of 
nuclear techniques to study environmental contamination. 
Lately, this project has also received a lot of support in view 
of recent global awareness of the need for protection of the 
environment. From the analytical and chemical points of view, 
nuclear methods are very precise and very effective. 
  Last year, within the framework of this project, we held a 
seminar in Cuba on the subject of the utilization of nuclear 
techniques on the environment. Three Latin American scholars 
participated in this seminar and benefitted from it. [end 
recording] 
  One of the most important projects of the ARCAL program in 
Latin America involves the industrial utilization of radioactive 
isotopes as tracers to further improve the quality of industrial 
processes. 
  As in previous cases, Cuban experts and technicians are 
obtaining precious experience in the implementation of these 
techniques and plan to pass it on to other regional countries 
through meetings, scholarship, and specialization courses in the 
future. 
  [Begin Codorniu recording] This year, 1994, we plan three 
important regional projects within the framework of ARCAL. One 
project involves a regional seminar on nuclear progress and 
instrumentation. 
  One objective of this seminar is to share with other Latin 
American countries experiences -- especially Cuban experiences, 
although those of other regional countries will also be 
presented -- regarding progress in developing equipment for 
nuclear programs. 
  That seminar will be followed, right here, by a final 
meeting 
on nuclear instrumentation. This is a five-year project that 
has concluded. The coordinators of this project will come from 
all countries involved in it. The participating countries will 
take advantage of the seminar to analyze the results of the 
project. One of the most positive aspects of this project, in 
our opinion, is that it has enabled the acquisition of spare 
parts by Latin American countries. 
  We are going to have another regional seminar from 28 
November to 11 December. This seminar will be an advanced 
course on the synthesis of modern radiopharmaceutical products. 
As you know, one of the main objectives of our current program 
-- and this is also an objective of other Latin American 
countries, each focussing on its own development and national 
policies -- is to produce in our country the radioactive 
substances necessary for the program. Radiopharmaceuticals, as 
you all know, are the substances used by doctors who practice 
what we call nuclear medicine to make medical diganosis. 
  By 1995, the work of the Cuban nuclear program will be 
directed toward research to complement research already being 
done in agriculture. One aspect of this research, which has a 
broad participation from all the research centers in the 
country, has to do with the combined used of nuclear and 
hydrotechnology for improved agricultural production of items 
important to Cuba, such as rice, sugarcane, and beans. 
  We firmly back this program. We are calling for very active 
participation by our center in this program, which is being 
planned on the basis of coordinated research, that is, on the 
basis of the idea that various research centers in various 
countries of the region tackle one single problem from various 
angles. For example, the problem of how to produce more and 
better rice, suitable for the various regions of Latin America. 
Various research centers of the region would then have specific 
tasks in that program and their information would be shared, so 
that regional resources may be utilized in a more rational way, 
realizing, for example, that my laboratory may have some 
techniques that Mexico does not have and Mexico may have things 
that I do not have. This way we could complement each other. 
  Another very interesting program we believe Cuba could 
participate in is the improvement of vegetables and the handling 
of soil and water resources using nuclear techniques. 
  This program is very much linked to agriculture. It is like 
guaranteeing the best and most inexpensive -- speaking from the 
point of view of the cost of fertilizers, irrigation, and so 
forth -- growing of certain crops. Our country also has 
experience in the use of radioactive istopes, such as stable 
isotopes like nitrogen 15, to determine the amount necessary and 
the adequate moment for using a fertilizer or to determine, 
using nuclear techniques, when an irrigation effort has not been 
effective. 
  This program has an objective. It has been designed in a way 
similar to that of Peru's, that is, through coordinated research 
among countries. This particular program relies, basically, on 
four countries. This does not mean that they will be the only 
ones that participate because other countries will participate 
also, but basically, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela, will be 
the four countries on which the program will rely. [end 
recording] 
  Cuba's efforts through ARCAL in favor of Latin America and 
the rest of the developing countries to secure the latest 
information on nuclear science and technology enhance the 
prestige of the island. Cuba's nuclear achievements have been 
praised by well-known international experts. 
  Cuba's nuclear program continues developing in the midst of 
shortages and limitations the country is enduring and it is 
expanding its ratio of action to include research that may offer 
new alternatives for national progress.

  [Text] The Jose Marti Electric Plant in Matanzas has 
rejoined the National Electric System following a 88-day 
maintenance and calibration program. The plant generator is 
producing over 31 megawatts, near its top performance capacity. 
Chief Engineer Fermin Infante stated the generator is still 
undergoing tests without interrupting the electricity generation 
which, as we know, is attained by burning Cuban oil. 
  To give an idea of the significance of using Cuban oil, all 
that is needed is to mention that from 1986 to date, this 
35-megawatt unit has used almost 500,000 tons of oil which 
represents a saving of $22 million. The Jose Marti Plant will 
deliver an average of 19,000 megawatts a month and soon will be 
testing the Varamulsion mix, a higher quality fuel mixture 
containing Cuban oil.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with ANPP Vice President Jaime Crombet </F>
by Carmen Gloria] 
  [Text] Today, the board of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] assessed the energy program in Granma 
Province. ANPP Vice President Jaime Crombet Hernandez-Baquero 
was present. 
  [Begin recording] [Gloria] Mr. Crombet, please refer to the 
results achieved so far here in Granma. It has been learned that 
some 547.9 tons of fuel have been saved. How would you appraise 
this? 
  [Crombet] The overall work of the province in the sphere of 
energy is good, and I must stress the consistency in this area 
because it involves many areas of work. This task cannot be 
measured in figures. The work in the sugar industry is 
outstanding. We can certainly stress the work of the Basic 
Industry Ministry in electricity; the work of the Agriculture 
Ministry in agriculture; and as for water resources, this 
province, especially in the mountains, has great hydroelectric 
potential in its rivers and dams. Several municipalities in the 
mountainous region can become self-sufficient in energy, 
especially if we manage to complete all the minihydroelectric 
dam projects within a reasonable time, considering the available 
water resources. 
  [Gloria] What can you tell us about initiatives to conserve 
fuel in this province? 
  [Crombet] Saving is admirable. We have seen, however, that 
although potentials are great, there are still some negative 
points. Not everything is going well or efficiently. But, 
generally, I can say that the work done in this province is good 
and that workers here have been working in a continuous and 
systematic manner. [end recording]

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], today 
termed the U.S.-sponsored summit slated for December 1994 in 
Miami, Florida, a blow against the Ibero-American integration 
movement. 
  In remarks to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon said that in view of 
this reality, the Ibero-American countries, the presidents of 
which will meet in the Colombian town of Cartagena de Indias in 
June 1994, will have to make a clear commitment to strengthen 
such an integrationist movement. 
  Alarcon added that if a specific program of Latin American 
and Caribbean integration is achieved, and if progress is 
achieved toward that objective, those invited will go to the 
Miami conference with the assurance of being a strong group in 
an unprecedented case of Ibero-American relationship. 
  Alarcon added that the fourth Ibero-American summit will 
become a moment of reaffirmation and consolidation of the 
movement it represents. He also referred to the Cuban exclusion 
from the invitations extended by the United States for the Miami 
summit, and called it an attempt to return international reality 
to the situation that prevailed 20 years ago. 
  Alarcon will leave tomorrow, 21 May, for London to comply 
with an official invitation extended by the two chambers of the 
British Parliament. He will stay one week in the UK.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The Cuban emigrants' right-wing forces in the United 
States and the Western news media have wasted no time or 
opportunity in downplaying or minimizing the role that The 
Nation and the Emgrigants Conference played in the path to 
normal relations between Cubans inside and outside Cuba. The 
most hostile elements went as far as to launch a campaign of 
terror against a group of U.S.-based emigres who came to Havana 
in late April to participate in the meeting, which the attendees 
described as very useful. 
  Cubans, who until now have comprised the so-called silent 
majority, prevented by the right from expressing their views in 
favor of a dialogue with the island's government, are beginning 
to defy extremists like the members of the Cuban American 
National Foundation [FNCA], one of the groups that has tried 
hardest to minimize the scope of the Havana meeting. 
  Raymundo del Toro, president of the Cuban-American Committee 
for Peace, in a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, pointed out that 
his only son lives in Cuba and all members of his group have 
relatives on the island. That is why, Del Toro noted, we will 
no longer be the silent majority who remain quiet in the face of 
attacks by opportunistic politicians like Representative Robert 
Torricelli, who sponsored the amendment that stiffened the 
blockade on Cuba, and egomaniacs like Jorge Mas Canosa, head of 
the FNCA. 
  In his letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Del Toro affirmed that 
the important thing about the aforementioned conference is the 
agreements reached, not whether the participants had a chat with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro. Del Toro is among the emigres who 
left the meeting satisfied, as its balance was significant in 
terms facilites for emigrants. 
  In the opinion of Andres Gomez, coordinator of the Antonio 
Maceo Brigade, the changes in migration policy that eliminate 
the five-year waiting period for Cubans who left the country 
legally to return to the country will benefit thousands of 
Cubans eager to have more fluid relations with their family 
members and country of origin. Although this was not the only 
agreement reached in Havana, the extreme right among the emigres 
and in the Western media insist on saying that participants in 
the conference left empty-handed. In this letter, Del Toro 
regretted that the meeting in Havana has been downplayed. 
  During a news conference in Miami, Gomez took a step farther 
in asking: Why do the gentlemen of the extreme right and the 
media refuse to hold a debate? Are not they always claiming 
they are democrats? Let them dare to practice what they claim 
to be.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon for the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Thirty years after the first agrarian reform was 
signed in Cuba to authorize the private ownership of land up to 
a maximum of 412 hectares, agriculture has entered a new phase 
in which land exploitation by cooperatives prevails over large 
state-owned enterprises. The first agrarian reform eliminated 
large estates in Cuba and turned 100,000 peasants into land 
owners. These peasants tilled land plots as tenants until 1959, 
but a second law affecting this sector reduced to 67 hectares 
the land that a person could own. 
  This provision is still in effect, but the private ownership 
of land is not the prevalent formula. Instead, it is the 
ownership of land by cooperatives, mainly as a result of a law 
issued last year creating the so-called basic cooperative 
production units [UBPC's]. Given the critical shortage of fuel, 
fertilizers, herbicides, and spare parts for tractors and other 
machinery in Cuba, it was not possible to maintain large 
agricultural enterprises where large-scale production relied 
mainly on the availability of the above-mentioned products. 
  Cooperatives that existed prior to this and were created 
after peasants voluntarily relinquished their privately-owned 
land were followed in 1993 by the experience of the UBPC's, 
characterized by the granting of state-owned land plots to 
agricultural workers for their use. The cooperatives combine 
social and individual interests much better and, without 
becoming small estates, turn extensive state-owned enterprises 
into smaller areas ranging between 300 and 1,000 hectares to 
render them more manageable under the current conditions. 
  The new cooperative members purchase the state's machinery 
and raw materials for their crops; they own their production; 
and they distribute their profits every year according to the 
yields of their harvests. The principles that rule the new form 
of activity and production in Cuban agriculture are the result 
of an analysis of the economic feasibility, profit margins, and 
the sustained increase of production with less resources. 
  The degree of participation in the new cooperatives has been 
high -- approximately 1,600 UBPC's were created in the sugar 
cane sector and approximately 900 were created to raise other 
crops -- with tangible results like a better distribution of the 
day's work. This confirms that the country is adapting its 
agricultural system according to the needs of every phase in the 
search for more efficiency in this sector, which is vital for 
all the nourishment of all Cubans.

  [Text] At the conclusion of the vote count, the Central 
Electoral Commission of the Dominican Republic declared 
President Joaquin Balaguer the winner of the elections held on 
Monday [16 May.] In the final provisional bulletin, Balaguer 
maintained a one- point margin over Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, 
who demanded the annulment of the elections due to reported 
frauds. 
  Today, THE NEW YORK TIMES commented that the international 
community should not recognize President Balaguer's victory if 
it is the result of electoral fraud, as credible sources have 
indicated. THE NEW YORK TIMES pointed out that Balaguer was also 
accused of committing fraud in 1990's general elections, which 
confirmed him as president of that nation for another term.

  [Text] At a meeting with the press at the Cuban Institute 
of Friendship with Peoples [ICAP], Palestinian Ambassador to 
Cuba Imad Jad'a discussed matters related to the situation of 
the Palestinian people. Reporter (Ilia Sardina) reports further 
details: 
  [Begin recording] [(Sardina)] The Palestinian ambassador 
said 
the decisive factor and the final objective in his people's 
struggle is represented by the national unity which seeks 
reconstruction, and also the alleviation of the pain the 
Palestinian people have been suffering over the past 45 years of 
struggle. He added that the difficulties have not ended and that 
everyone's efforts are required for this new stage. 
  [Jad'a] This is the first time in the history of the 
Palestinian people that we will be able to begin building our 
sovereignty ourselves. To achieve this, we need everyone's 
cooperation, primarily from the Palestinian people, to work as 
hard as possible for Palestine. Today we have a good chance to 
work for Palestine because we have always lived in pain and we 
have always had to work for the unity of Palestine, as a facade, 
while it was really for the Arab reconciliation. 
  [(Sardina)] The ambassador also referred to the difficulties 
they will have to face. 
  [Jad'a] It was relatively easy for Palestinian guerrillas to 
put on their ammunition belts and [words indistinct] a tank. But 
today it is more difficult to unite those Palestinians to build 
a school, where those little boys who have spent eight years of 
the intifada on the streets, will study. This is what I mean by 
difficulties. It means the need for serious work, for help from 
our true friends. 
  And speaking of our true friends, I can never forget the 
role 
Cuba has always played in supporting the rights of the 
Palestinian people. Today, I can also extend the good news to 
all: We have signed some agreements for economic and political 
cooperation in the future. 
  We are also preparing for an exchange of visits by 
Palestinian delegations to Cuba, and vice versa, to see how we 
can develop and improve, and how to channel Palestinian-Cuban 
relations. [end recording]

  [Text] Raising the new South African flag over Cuba was a 
symbol of the important phase now beginning in the historic ties 
between Cuba and South Africa. This was stressed at the first 
official ceremony of the new South African Government held at 
the ANC headquarters in Havana. 
  The ceremony sealed the deep friendship and spirit of 
camaraderie existing among us since Cuba opened its doors to us. 
This was stated at the ceremony by (Makayia Mochia), permanent 
ANC representative to Cuba. 
  [Begin (Mochia) recording] In raising this flag here, we 
acknowledge the fact that our friendship and camaraderie are 
entering a new and more significant phase. The protocols signed 
recently in Pretoria between our two governments bear witness to 
this fact. [end recording] 
  Politburo members Jose Ramon Balaguer; Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina;, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government; and other ministers and 
Cuban authorities, as well as the African diplomatic crops 
accredited in Cuba, were in attendance. 
  The ceremony gave Robaina an opportunity to give a brief 
address: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] Allow me, at this time, to render 
homage to the South African people, the main protagonists in 
this long struggle, who through perseverance and undying will, 
and even at the risk of their lives, made today's victory 
possible. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ismael Merida read by Angel De la Guardia </F>
Hernandez; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Greetings to all. Determined to make the best use 
of the days left in May and however many work shifts it takes 
June, Cuban sugar producers at their daily tasks confirm that 
the harvest battle can be won with less than half the resources 
required in previous years. Sugar workers confirm with their 
daily actions during this tense and difficult final, lap that 
the commitment to fulfill the sugar plan is irreversible and 
will be maintained. 
  Good examples of this are Havana and Guantanamo Provinces, 
the first to fulfill their respective sugar production plans. 
Other good news is that Sancti Spiritu Province, one of the 
country's largest, is about to join the vanguard with its stable 
and secure work. 
  Rain, blessed when in season, has not beat down the Cuban 
sugar producers' will to win. They understand the urgent need, 
for the sake of the country's economy, to cut and mill all 
available sugarcane and to not stop until the projected volume 
of sugar has been reached. Cuban sugar producers are aware that 
working in a very humid environment is not someone's whim and 
that there is no alternative but to further increase efforts and 
organization to process raw material that still remains in the 
fields, doing so with maximum efficiency. 
  The strategy now is to not limit industrial capacity, 
maintain a high level of productive combativeness, and not 
become frustrated with the rain, no matter how heavy it seems. 
The harvest, as Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres has said, 
must be viewed as a whole and unique industry which belongs to 
Cuba. That is why available resources are assigned to the 
center with the milling capacity. 
  Together with this battle, which is of unique economic 
importance to Cuba, there is intense work in sugarcane 
agriculture, especially in sowing and cleaning fields. A 
satisfactory national amount was reached during January to 
April, when approximately 6,000 caballerias of gramineae were 
sowed, with Camaguey Province standing out in this priority 
task. The amount of hand cutting during this stage is also 
worth noting. 
  In Cuba, sugarcane recovery is something like the main dish 
on the sugar menu. It is only logical that the increased yield 
per hectare should attract all the attention at this time of the 
year. But now, more than ever, these jobs must be carried out 
without neglecting what belongs to the sugar industry after more 
than 160 work shifts of daily work. 
  Cuban sugar producers, in cooperation with support groups, 
fight, invent, recover, work. They do not fold their arms; they 
see in old spares that were previously considered useless 
everything that can be made useful once again. This is the 
picture that has been painted; this is the reality of a period 
that demands attitudes such as these. Hard days pass, but the 
number one priority is victory.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments through 21 May: 
  A factory producing yogurt made of soybean milk has begun 
operations in the city of Holguin. This plant is the first of 
its kind in the country with Cuban technology. The factory 
reportedly has a daily production capacity of 10,000 liters, but 
is currently producing approximately 6,000 liters of yogurt, 
which are distributed every four days to children of between 7 
and 13 years of age in the environs of the city of Holguin. 
Soybean milk has the same nutritional properties as cow's milk 
but with the advantage that it can cause no hoof-and- mouth 
disease or high cholesterol. The report adds that 10 tons of 
yogurt can be obtained from one ton of soybeans. (Havana Cuba 
Vision Network in Spanish 2220 GMT 13 May 94) 
  The 1,000-member Jesus Ares Gayol manual canecutters 
contingent from Ciego de Avila has cut over 30 million arrobas 
of cane, exceeding their goal of 26 million arrobas. Rebelde 
adds that in Las Tunas Province, 700 caballerias are slated to 
be readied mechanically in May. (Havana Radio Rebelde in Spanish 
1700 GMT 16 May 94) 
  The workers of the agricultural-livestock enterprise in 
Songo-La Maya Municipality, Santiago de Cuba Province, increased 
milk collection slightly during the first four months of 1994, 
"although only 94 percent of the figure for the period was met. 
That enterprise obtained over 10,000 liters of milk, compared to 
the period January-April 1993, and that was due to an increase 
in fodder, a decrease in deaths, and the fact that three 
mini-dairies were operating." (Havana Radio Reloj in Spanish 
1947 GMT 16 May 94) 
  Friendship groups with Cuba from Argentina and Spain have 
presented a donation of medicines and clothing -- 38 boxes of 
medicines and laboratory supplies and over 800 hospital patient 
gowns and medical personnel uniforms -- to the provincial 
hospital in Ciego de Avila. In addition, the Argentine 
organization Ciao Bloqueo has given Ciego de Avila province 
1,200 kg of wheat flour and 300 liters of cooking oil. (Havana 
Cuba Vision Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 17 May 94) 
  Eighty-four percent of the farming cooperatives in Sancti 
Spiritus, Cabaiguan, and Fomento Municipalities are profitable. 
The cooperative sector has attained profits of approximately 7.5 
million pesos. The 72 farming cooperatives in Sancti Spiritus 
Province have over 900 tractors, 28 sugarcane combines, 96 
trucks, and over 10,000 teams of oxen. (Havana Radio Reloj in 
Spanish 1403 GMT 17 May 94) 
  The Youth Labor Army's Victoria de Giron Citrus Farm No. 2 
in 
Matanzas Province made a profit of 1.45 million pesos in the 
period from January to April. (Havana Radio Rebelde in Spanish 
0900 GMT 18 May 94) 
  The presentation of new Cuban tourist products is the center 
of attraction at the Cuba-94 Tourism Convention which is being 
held in Varadero. More than 900 figures from the international 
tourist sector are participating in the convention. The new 
hotel chain "Isla Azul" was presented. The chain will service 
national tourists. The chain has been set up exactly like the 
other hotel chains. Services will be available to vanguard 
workers, honeymooners, and a small portion will be aimed at 
international tourism as a means of self financing. (Havana 
Radio Rebelde in Spanish 1700 GMT 18 May 94) 
  The French National Society for Bulk Export of Tobacco, 
(Seita), and Cubatabaco have signed in Geneva an accord for the 
sale of 6 million cigars by the end of 1994. (Seita) will extend 
a line of credit to Cubatabaco so that it can purchase the 
materials and supplies needed to raise the crop and manufacture 
the cigars. Cubatabaco has also granted (Seita) a license to 
produce Minicoibar cigars in France. (Havana Radio Rebelde in 
Spanish 1700 GMT 19 May 94) 
  The Pedro Soto nickel plant resumed production after 
concluding its scheduled maintenance program. (Havana Cuba 
Vision in Spanish 0000 GMT 18 May 94) 
  Some 24,200,000 drying poles of tobacco were harvested in 
Pinar del Rio. This amount is 450,000 poles more than those 
collected last year. Current estimates is that some 300,000 
quintals of tobacco will be harvested this year, 39,000 quintals 
more than in 1993. (Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300

<F P=106> [Stella van Rijn report: "Netherlands Antilles Seeks To Curb </F>
Arms Trade"] 
  [Text] P. Atacho, the Netherlands Antillean justice 
minister, wants to impose strict restraints on the arms trade. 
In the last years, chaos seems to have resulted from a lack of 
control, particularly in Curacao. In December, the United 
States decided to suspend arms supplies to the Netherlands 
Antilles due to the increase in the quantity of weapons entering 
the country. Exactly how many is not known. 
  This prompted the minister to launch an enquiry and to take 
measures to stop this proliferation. There are five licensed 
arms dealers operating in Curacao, but just two of them were 
found to comply with the regulations. The others had more 
weapons than authorized and also different kinds of weapons, the 
Public Prosecutor' enquiry revealed. The licenses are soon to 
be withdrawn and also more strictly controlled. It also seems 
that the nine rifle clubs in Curacao are able to independently 
import and even export weapons under present regulations. This 
will also stop. 
  The government is to ask the United States to partially lift 
the export ban in order to guarantee deliveries to the 
government and security bodies. 
  The illegal arms trade represents a possibly even greater 
problem. There have been many armed attacks over the last two 
years and sometimes very young children can be seen in the 
streets with guns. There is also an increasing tendency for 
arguments between (groups of) young people to result in the use 
of arms. It is unlikely that these weapons came into 
circulation via the legal channels of the licensed arms dealer. 
  "I have no idea of the extent of illegal arms ownership," 
Minister Atacho declared. Combatting the illegal ownership of 
arms is certainly one of the priorities for the police and 
intelligence services. "I also see it as a social problem which 
is related to the collapse in standards and values in our 
society. And everyone must bear a part of the responsibility 
for this," the minister stated.

  [Excerpts] As the date for tight international sanctions 
for Haiti draws near, some nationals believe that Barbados 
should be part of the peacekeeping or police force sent to 
Haiti. However, for the most part, they do not seem too keen on 
housing Haitian refugees. Nobeline Brewster tells us more: 
  [Begin recording] [Brewster] Media reports say the United 
States is asking Caribbean nations to provide a temporary or 
permanent home for the Haitians and part of a military or police 
force. This as efforts intensify to get rid of the military and 
restore democracy to the French-speaking nation. Government 
officials in Barbados wouldn't say much more than that the 
Haitian crisis is being discussed, but other Barbadians are 
quite vocal. Senator Dr. Erskins Simmons says we should open 
our doors to as many Haitians as we can. Dr. Simmons argues 
that Haiti was home to many Caribbean people in the past and the 
region must now return the favor. He says we could seek 
financial assistance from the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees. 
  [Simmons] Lots of Barbadians, Vincentians, Jamaicans 
migrated 
to Haiti in the early days. We put strain on their social 
systems when we were under pressure. We owe it to them to take 
some of the strain off of their social systems now because their 
social systems cannot absorb the type of problems that they 
have. [passage omitted] 
  [Brewster] But many other Barbadians are not too keen on 
allowing Haitians here, but all seem to agree on Barbadian 
participation in an international force. 
  [Unidentified speaker] If you have armies and your neighbor 
is in trouble, and the armies are not going to help the 
neighbor, what is the sense of having the army? This is a 
tailor-made situation where we can use an army effectively. Of 
course, we cannot fight [words indistinct], but certainly we can 
be there to give moral support to whichever developed countries 
are willing to restore democracy back to Haiti again. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Brewster] The U.S. is currently conducting exercises off 
Haiti and political analysts say they may be preparing for a 
military intervention. U.S. President Bill Clinton says such 
intervention may be used to get rid of the defiant Haitian Army.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 21 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Dominican 
Republic electoral authorities announced they will verify the 
vote count of last Monday's general elections following an 
accord by contending parties to detect possible irregularities. 
  After reporting an alleged fraud in favor of the Christian 
Social Revolutionary Party (PRSC), which nominated incumbent 
President Joaquin Balaguer, the opposition Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) agreed with its government rival to 
review the vote count. 
  The Central Electoral Board (JCE) said next Wednesday a 
special commission will verify "vote by vote" the lists used in 
the presidential elections to corroborate the legitimacy of 
Balaguer's victory. 
  According to the official vote count, suspended Thursday 
following fraud reports by the opposition, Balaguer defeated PRD 
candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez by just 1 percent of the 
approximately 3 million votes cast. 
  The JCE awarded Pena Gomez 41.3 percent of the vote, but 
declared Balaguer the winner with 42.4 percent of the 94.8 
percent of votes counted. This would permit the incumbent 
president to begin his seventh term in office. 
  Pena Gomez demanded the cancellation of the elections in 
various parts of the country because of alleged irregularities 
in the preparation of the electoral register. These alleged 
irregularities reportedly prevented about 200,000 people from 
casting their votes, despite the fact they presented the 
required documentation. 
  The PRD candidate charged before the JCE that there were 
people who were not allowed to vote because their names did not 
appear on official government lists. "That advantage 
attributed to President Balaguer must be investigated," warned 
Pena Gomez, who accused the JCE of acting in complicity with the 
PRSC. This allegation was supported by international observers 
who witnessed the electoral process. 
  The Dominican elections were supervised by the international 
community because of the influence this Caribbean nation has 
over Haiti. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the 
territory of the Caribbean island, Hispanola. Foreign concern 
is of particular importance in light of the "harsher" embargo 
imposed by the United Nations on Haiti, which will take effect 
at midnight this Saturday.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 May (DPA) -- Today, Manuel Garcia 
Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board (JCE) warned 
the board has not yet officially announced any of the candidates 
as the winner of the recent election. He explained that they 
must wait for the computer technicians to complete their work. 
The specialists are evaluating a claim made by the Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) regarding differences between official 
JCE reports and the results offered to the parties on diskette. 
The investigation reportedly began yesterday following a 
resolution issued by the JCE itself. 
  Garcia Lizardo said he was unable to give a specific date 
for 
the announcement of the winner, but stressed that he would try 
to make it as soon as possible. Last night, the JCE issued the 
last official bulletin detailing the presidential vote tallying 
process. There are still 233 voting tables yet to be tallied, 
and it was reported that it will still be a while before those 
results are in. 
  The JCE president announced that next week, the board would 
decide on the many claims presented at the JCE "so everything is 
out in the open." He said the members of the JCE would soon be 
meeting to decide on all of these petitions. 
  The Board is currently considering a request by the PRD for 
copies of the lists used at the voting tables on election day to 
compare the lists with each of the tally sheets and then the 
official results issued by the JCE. The board also must review 
the charges filed against two of the board's magistrates, who 
the PRD has accused of having acted in favor of the ruling 
Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC). The magistrates are 
Leonardo Matos Berrido and Jose Henriquez Almanzar. 
  There is a petition outstanding with the board filed by the 
"Committee of Witnesses of the Civil Pact" for a review of each 
of the individual voting table tally sheets filed during the 
election. The committee, known also as the "civil pact follow up 
committee," is made up of renowned Dominican figures, among whom 
are German Ornes and Rafael Herrera, the directors of the EL 
CARIBE and LISTIN DIARIO newspapers; Bishops Agripino Nunez 
Collado and Jose Arnaiz; and Former Chief Justice Manuel Berges 
Chuppani of the Supreme Court of Justice.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Social 
Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) announced its militants are 
determined to defend "with their own lives" President Joaquin 
Balaguer's presumed victory in last Monday's general elections. 
In a communique, the ruling party said that from now on, 
Balaguer's followers are declaring themselves "on permanent 
vigil to defend Joaquin Balaguer's triumph." 
  Based on provisional results announced by the Central 
Electoral Board, JCE, Balaguer is reportedly the virtual winner 
of the 16 May elections. Opposition candidate Francisco Pena 
Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) has contested 
the results. 
  The most recent results released by the JCE showed Balaguer 
leading with a margin of 1.01 percent over Pena Gomez. The JCE, 
however, has yet to review the irregularities reported by Pena 
Gomez, who claims that approximately 200,000 opposition 
militants were not in the electoral registry. 
  The charges made by the Social Democratic candidate were 
supported by international observers who supervised the 
elections. Representatives from the business sector, the 
Catholic Church, and the media have issued a call to the JCE to 
seek a solution to the postelectoral crisis and prevent possible 
street riots. 
  Although there have been no acts of disorder so far, the 
authorities decided to deploy Army and National Police troops in 
Santo Domingo and along roads leading to the capital. The troops 
have been confiscating small arms from the civilian population.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 22 May (AFP) -- Leaders of the 
Nationalist Union [UN], a group linked to President Joaquin 
Balaguer, have accused U.S. Ambassador Roberto Pastorino of 
"meddling" in the country's domestic affiars. 
  The charge was voiced this Sunday by UN leader Delfin 
Vasquez, who accused Ambassador Pastorino of favoring opposition 
presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez in the middle 
of a postelectoral crisis following the controversial elections 
last Monday. 
  According to the UN, Pastorino spearheads a plan to 
destabilize the Dominican Republic and begin an "intervention" 
that would culminate with a plan to "merge" this nation and 
Haiti into a single nation. 
  Velasquez said a UN delegation will travel to the United 
States soon to protest Pastorino's actions before the Department 
of State, and to tell the people of the United States about the 
plan to merge the two nations. These two countries share the 
island known as Hispanola during colonial times. 
  A radio and television campaign intensified over the weekend 
reporting that France and the United States intend to solve the 
Haitian crisis by unifying it with the Dominican Republic. The 
opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), however, said 
the UN seeks to distract the people's attention from the 
"outrageous fraud" reportedly perpetrated during the 16 May 
general elections. The PRD links the UN with President Joaquin 
Balaguer. 
  As of Sunday 22 May, the Central Electoral Board had not yet 
announced the winner of the election, whose main contenders were 
Balaguer and Pena Gomez.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 22 May (AFP) -- Provisional 
President Emile Jonassaint, who is not recognized by the 
international community, has ordered Haitian authorities to 
severely punish the organizers of secret trips to the United 
States. According to a communique broadcast on state television 
Saturday night, the justice minister has asked government 
prosecutors in trial courts to "implement the 17 November 1980 
decree which punishes criminals and accomplices of those who 
organize secret trips abroad." 
  There has been a clear increase over the past two weeks in 
the number of Haitian "boat people" [preceding two words in 
English] intercepted and turned back by U.S. Coast Guard cutters 
while trying to reach the Florida coastline in flimsy boats. 
According to Haitian sources, this increase is due to 
deteriorating living conditions among the poor population 
following UN sanctions, fueled by the hope of getting close 
enough to the Florida coastline not to be turned back, which was 
recently the case for 500 Haitians, as well as the new 
procedures established by U.S. President Bill Clinton in favor 
of Haitian "boat people." These procedures, which are not yet 
in effect, include a preliminary interview for requesters of 
political asylum before a decision on expulsion is made. 
  To this end, the United States has chartered two Ukrainian 
vessels and has begun discussions with the UK on installing the 
refugees in camps on Turks and Caicos Islands, a British crown 
colony north of Haiti.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 22 May (DPA) -- More than 1,000 
Haitians gathered today in a vigil, rejecting the new economic 
and commercial embargo, almost a total embargo, imposed against 
the ruling military in Haiti. 
  The demonstrators, who termed the event a nonpartisan show 
of 
patriotism, were flanked by military security patrols, a safety 
measure never before offered to exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide's supporters. 
  A witness said the demonstrators shouted chants against 
foreigners. The chants are evidence of an increasing negative 
sentiment against foreigners, confirmed by several expatriates 
as the deadline for the enforcement of the new measures 
approaches. Several foreign news teams had reportedly been 
arrested and detained for a few hours by the Haitian police in 
recent days.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- The Haitian Army has 
been on maximum alert since Friday, according to reliable 
sources in Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, acting President Emile 
Jonaissaint's government, which has no international 
recognition, threatened to enforce grave punishment against 
those who "contact the enemies of the homeland or one of their 
agents." 
  Numerous groups of armed military, many of them in civilian 
garb, circulated through the streets of the capital on Sunday. 
Information, Culture, and Coordination Minister Jacques 
Saint-Louis recalled in a communique that "contacts to let the 
enemy enter the national territory" or seize military facilities 
will be sentenced to "hard labor for life." The same punishment 
may befall those who have "delivered blueprints" to the enemy, 
the communique adds, without specifying who the enemy is. 
  The law will also be inflexible concerning those who try to 
"undermine the fidelity of officers, soldiers, and Navy 
members." The document states "any type of offense, insult, or 
threat against a public force officer will be punished by 
between one to six months in prison" and "between one to three 
years" if the perpetrator is a member of the legislative branch. 
  If "the crime or felony of rebellion is confirmed in 
speeches 
or public documents, the perpetrator will be punished with a 
minimum of six days and a maximum of one year in prison, 
provided the rebellion did not occur," it adds. 
  "Revoked civilian or military officials who continue to 
exercise their functions after their replacement will be 
punished with between six months and two years in prison," 
warned Saint-Louis, although the government of Prime Minister 
Robert Malval, who resigned, is the only one which received 
international recognition. 
  The communique was issued 24 hours after the enforcement of 
what is practically a total embargo against Haiti to force the 
military to abandon power, while a small but influential 
minority continually pressures the White House to intervene 
militarily in the Caribbean country.

  [Excerpts] The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights 
has ended its visit to Haiti after investigating the human 
rights situation in Haiti. The delegation met with the media on 
20 May. Rothschild Francois reports live: 
  [Francois] Good Afternoon! The visit of the Inter-American 
Commission for Human Rights delegation, which came to 
investigate the human rights situation in Haiti, has concluded. 
The members of the delegation pointed out that the situation is 
grave. They said they were able to meet with many people who 
were victims of human rights violations in Haiti. They also 
recorded cases of summary executions, abduction, and arbitrary 
arrests, mostly within the sector of the population favoring the 
return of President Aristide to Haiti. 
  The OAS delegation stressed that according to the 
testimonies 
they collected, the responsibility for those human rights 
violations falls entirely on the military, armed civilians as 
well as members of FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the 
Advancement and Progress of Haiti]. 
  The delegation also denounced the many cases of rape 
reported, especially by women whose husbands or relatives are 
supporters of President Aristide, especially in the slum areas 
of Port-au-Prince. For members of this delegation, these 
violations fall within the scope of crimes against humanity. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be noted that during this news conference, members 
of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights recommended an 
increase in the number of civilian mission observers in Haiti. 
The commission believes that the mission is doing a good job so 
far. 
  It should also be noted that the delegation solicited a 
meeting with the military heads, including the head of the Army 
and of the Port-au-Prince police, neither of whom responded, and 
the delegation is due to leave Port-au-Prince in a few hours. 
The delegation promises to make a detailed report, within the 
framework of the situation of human rights in Haiti, to the OAS 
General Assembly, due to be held in Brazil next month. 
  Further details will be provided in our next broadcast 
regarding this detailed report by members of the delegation of 
the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, which stayed for 
a week in Port-au-Prince, having come to investigate the 
situation of human rights in Haiti. According to statements to 
the press prior to their departure, the delegation considers 
this situation is worsening each day.

  [Text] Washington is campaigning for foreign military 
intervention in Haiti. The U.S. Government has proposed -- 
without success -- that Latin American and Caribbean countries 
participate in a multinational force designed to invade Haiti 
and oust the military from power, according to a report in the 
Mexican newspaper EXCELSIOR, which claims that it holds 
diplomatic documents proving its statement. The newspaper says 
the U.S. State Department is sounding out the willingness in 
Latin America and the Caribbean to participate in an armed 
operation against the military regime in place in Haiti since 
1991. 
  The article, signed by Jose Manuel Neva, EXCELSIOR 
Washington 
correspondent, points out that the government of President Bill 
Clinton has failed in its attempts to convince countries to use 
force, except for the Governments of Argentina, Uruguay, and the 
English-speaking Caribbean countries that support the U.S. 
initiative. The article points out that on 12 May, acting 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott gathered the Latin American 
and Caribbean diplomatic corps accredited to the White House and 
the OAS to sound out their participation in an invasion force. 
Quoting reliable sources, Neva says this is one of the three 
options being considered by the Clinton administration for a way 
out of the Haitian crisis. The other is the formation of a force 
of Haitian refugees, and the third -- which is the least 
feasible -- is a U.S. unilateral intervention. 
  Private consultations also took place on the same topic 
[words indistinct] other allies within the United Nations, 
especially in the configuration and specific mandate of an 
intervention force. Besides Secretary of State Talbott, Under 
Secretary of State for American Affairs Alexander Watson, new 
Clinton representative for Haiti (William Grey), and U.S. 
Permanent Representative to the OAS Harriett Babbitt. [sentence 
as heard] The conclave points out that the invasion of Haiti is 
an option under active consideration and may be seen by the 
White House as the last means Bill Clinton can use to resolve 
the Haitian crisis.

  [Text] Let us point out that the new, unofficial minister 
of foreign affairs, attorney... [pauses] Mr. Charles David, who 
was appointed this week by the military regime in 
Port-au-Prince, has refused to resign from his post as 
journalist of the daily LA PRESSE in Montreal, according to the 
newspaper's management. 
  The appointment of Mr. David, 53, to a government not 
recognized by Ottawa, has led the Canadian Government to freeze 
his Canadian assets. LA PRESSE, which has employed him for 22 
years as journalist in charge of international issues, cannot 
dismiss him for the moment. Under the provisions of the 
newspaper's collective convention, he obtained a six-month leave 
without pay so he could devote himself to his political 
activities. The LA PRESSE management advises that if David 
returns to the newspaper before the expiration of the six-month 
period, he can no longer work in international service. After 
this period, he will lose his job. 
  In an editorial published on 18 May, LA PRESSE condemned the 
unofficial government in power in Port-au-Prince, which it 
labels illegitimate, unelected, and antidemocratic; and 
disapproves of Charles David's decision to be a part of it.

  [Text] Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] is to adopt a new, 
outward-looking foreign policy orientation. So says Trinidad's 
Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj. Maraj made this comment 
upon his return from the Caricom Foreign Ministers meeting held 
in Belize. According to the minister, Caricom can no longer 
afford to be inward-looking. He points to Caricom's 
participation in a number of regional summits as evidence that 
the grouping is serious about establishing wider trading links. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Recently returned 
from the 20th meeting of the Standing Committee of Foreign 
Ministers, in Belize, Minister Maraj said Caricom is no longer 
solely concerned with the integration process. While he 
acknowledges that integration will always be a priority, the 
foreign minister says Caricom realizes a need to interact with 
other regional trading blocs. Minister Maraj feels foreign 
policy coordination among member countries has remained at the 
level of rhetoric for too long. With the coming of the World 
Trade Organization and the new foreign policy outreach of the 
region, he says there will be an absolute need for Caricom to 
combine its efforts at internatinal fora. 
  [Maraj] Whatever it is that we consider important [word 
indistinct] the region, the particular vulnerability of small 
countries like ours, all of the Caricom countries will be 
shooting together to ensure that our voice is heard. I must tell 
you that this is important because this has not happened before. 
  [Reporter] Minister Maraj says the Caricom secretariat has 
been mandated to compile a list of matters of collective concern 
for discussion. He says Caricom will seek to have its concerns 
included on the agenda for the December hemispheric conference 
in Miami. Minister Maraj says too that Caricom will hold summits 
with Mexico and Canada. The expectation is that these 
discussions will foster Caricom's NAFTA ambitions. The minister 
says the decision was also taken for joint Caricom diplomatic 
representation in South Africa. [end recording]

  [Text] The government of Prime Minister Patrick Manning of 
Trinidad and Tobago has a called on opposition leader Basdeo 
Panday to prove the allegations of drug involvement. This 
challenge was dished out by deputy political leader of PNM 
[People's National Movement], Dr. (Keith Reilly). The opposition 
leader made this accusation in the House last week. Since then, 
he has been repeating it at recent political meetings. Sharon 
Coward tells us more: 
  [Begin recording] [Coward] Dr. (Reilly) says the opposition 
is against the amendments to the Dangerous Drug Act because it 
fears the disclosure of its own involvement in the drug trade. 
The PNM's deputy political leader calls on the opposition to 
present its evidence on cabinet members. 
  [(Reilly)] [passage indistinct] 
  [Coward] Prime Minister Patrick Manning says he is surprised 
at the NAR's [National Alliance for Reconstruction's] criticism 
of the government's energy policies. The prime minister 
maintained that the present policies are the best the country

additional iron carbide plants in this country.

  [Excerpt] Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de 
Vielman said yesterday that the Guatemalan Government is trying 
to persuade the U.S. Government to eliminate the travel warning 
that has decreased the flow of tourists to Guatemala. 
  She denied that the Guatemalan Government is not doing 
anything about the situation and said that efforts have been 
made both in Washington and at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala. 
  The minister said the interested parties should be aware 
that 
this warning is not aimed at Guatemala alone, but that such 
directives generally include several countries. That is why the 
Guatemalan Government has presented the necessary social and 
economic arguments for a favorable resolution, although this 
warning is a unilateral U.S. decision. 
  She said the hunger strike declared by a U.S. citizen in 
front of the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City is something that 
Washington should take into consideration when a new decision is 
made. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Four Guatemalan 
children were rescued by the police from a secret nursery in the 
home of a U.S. citizen who was arrested and charged with drug 
trafficking. 
  Police sources reported today, Saturday, that the children 
were found in a home owned by U.S. citizen Sara Matzar in 
Pabnjachel in the northwestern department of Solola. The 
residence was searched following the issuing of a judicial 
order, and a woman identified as Martina Matzar Sapin, who was 
caring for the children and is related to Sara, was arrested. 
  The children were identified as twins Joaquin and Rigoberto, 
five; Marcela Mercedes, three; and Eva Noelia Peron, five. 
  Martina Matzar said the four children are Sara's adopted 
children. She is being held in a prison in the Guatemalan 
capital, accused of alleged drug trafficking. Her extradition 
has been requested by the U.S. Embassy. 
  Police are investigating to determine the origin of the four 
children who, according to Martina Matzar, are from Santa 
Catarina Palopo, Solola. 
  There have been two incidents in 1994 involving two U.S. 
citizens accused by Guatemalan residents of being child 
snatchers, although the charges turned out to be false. 
  The U.S. Embassy has denied that its citizens are involved 
in 
the kidnapping of children.

  [Text] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday 
said his government will subsidize the increase in the electric 
power rate, whenever it goes into effect following the 
recommendations of the Multi Sector Commission. 
  The report on the electricity sector recommended a new rate 
per kilowatt hour that the INDE [National Electricity Institute] 
sells to the EEGSA [Empresa Electrica de Guatemala, S.A. -- 
Guatemalan Electric Power Company]. This will lead to an 
increase when the new rates take effect. De Leon Carpio 
indicated that "I already have the report," adding that the 
Guatemalan people can be certain that he will analyze the report 
carefully with his advisers. 
  Nevertheless, he said "we will continue with the subsidy, as 
recommended." He said his government has a policy of 
subsidizing the direct customer and that "this policy will have 
to continue until it no longer can be maintaisned." 
  He said he is very aware of the country's situation so he 
does not want to economically harm the poorest people.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 May (AFP) -- Honduras is willing to 
contribute to a multinational military force to restore 
democracy in Haiti, said Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz 
Aguilar on Saturday. 
  "The Honduran position has always been to unconditionally 
support the reinstatement of democracy in Haiti, a brother 
country which suffers an ignominious military dictatorship," Paz 
stated when recalling the military coup perpetrated against the 
Caribbean island's president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on 30 
September 1991. 
  During an interview with a local radio station, Paz said 
eventual Honduran participation in a multinational military 
force would have to occur within the framework of UN or OAS 
peace-keeping operations. 
  The foreign minister said, "Honduras is currently 
participating in a similar operation in the Western Sahara" at 
the request of the UN. 
  The head of Honduran foreign affairs emphasized Honduras has 
been "firm and categorical" when defending democracy in Haiti 
and in all countries where human rights are being violated.

<F P=106> [By Aura Lila Moreno] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo has said that the 
FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] Congress offers an 
extraordinary opportunity for Sandinists to make decisions 
concerning the country's future. He also denied there is any 
possibility of former President Daniel Ortega winning the 1996 
elections, because, according to Lacayo, Ortega is politically 
"burned out." 
  Lacayo refrained from expressing an opinion on the support 
that either of the two candidates for FSLN secretary general 
could have from groups participating in debates prior to the 
congress. He said he has tried to maintain respectful relations 
with the Sandinist leaders, although "most of those relations 
have been with Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramirez." 
  "We hope the FSLN will emerge united and convinced that 
violence belongs to the past," Lacayo said in a three-hour 
program broadcast by a local radio station during which he 
explained his views on various topics concerning the country's 
economic, political, and social life. 
<H5>  Gringos Caitudos </H5>
  Commenting on the U.S. Congress' ultimatum to the government 
to resolve the property problem or face the suspension of U.S. 
aid, Lacayo poked fun at Somozists who are demanding properties 
disguised as U.S. citizens, calling them "gringos caitudos 
[pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. 
citizens]," who are nothing more than "Nicaraguans whose 
properties were confiscated in 1979 as Somozists and who now 
return as U.S. citizens. 
  "There are many gringos caitudos saying `I am American.' 
They have almost forgotten Spanish," Lacayo said, adding that 
those people demanding properties "will be treated as 
Nicaraguans, because according to international law, the 
nationality that matters is the one the individual had at the 
time his rights were affected." 
<H5>  The Right Has a Visceral Hatred for Him </H5>
  After explaining his expectations for the results of the 
Sandinist Special Congress, Lacayo expressed his views on the 
subject of properties and the so-called Helms ultimatum, his 
optimism about Nicaragua's future, and the political 
possibilities he foresees for the 1996 electoral campaign. 
  According to the presidency minister, the extreme right 
attacks him with a visceral hatred because he maintains a 
central political position and because he has not allowed a 
return of the Somozist system. "They hate me because they 
thought Dona Violeta would `not have any authority' and that 
they would run the government with Vice President Virgilio Godoy 
as leader," he stressed. 
  "There is hatred because Dona Violeta is running the 
government and promoting a center project of reconciliation and 
national unity. They know the right doesn't stand a chance in 
the 1996 or 2002 elections as long as there is a political 
faction in the center, which makes them mad," Lacayo said. He 
compared the hostile treatment he receives from the rightist 
media to the "loving" way they treat former President Ortega. 
<H5>  Liberal-Somozist Plan </H5>
  Based on Lacayo's analysis, the Nicaraguan right is trying 
to 
imitate the strategy used by the Salvadoran right in the 
previous elections. "They are behind a Liberal-Somozist plan 
hoping that Daniel Ortega will be the leftist candidate like 
Ruben Zamora in El Salvador and that he will receive 24 percent 
of the votes while the right will get 50 percent," Lacayo 
stressed. 
  In his opinion, the rightists know very well that Ortega 
will 
not win if he runs for president in the next elections because 
"he is burned out, he confiscated properties, and he made war." 
In that sense, Lacayo said the right's biggest problem is "what 
to do with the center or with Antonio Lacayo, should he decide 
to be a candidate." 
  "They are obsessed with me, but their plan will fail, 
because 
people will never vote for a rightist option as long as there is 
a center option," Lacayo said. For the first time he openly 
admitted his presidential aspirations, saying that "I will not 
shirk the responsibility" if a center coalition chooses him as 
its candidate for the 1996 elections. 
  In Lacayo's opinion, if a Liberal-Somozist option wins in 
the 
1996 elections, "the Sandinists will not tolerate it." On the 
other hand, if an option from the "hackneyed left should win, 
the rightist sectors will try to make things hard for them."

<F P=106> [Report by Edgar Barberena S.] </F>
  [Text] A mysterious last-minute order, which all reporters 
attributed to Daniel Ortega, prohibited Radio Sandino from 
joining a national radio network to broadcast a roundtable 
discussion among the main proponents of renewal in the FSLN 
[Sandinist National Liberation Front], whose slogan is: "For a 
Sandinism That Turns to the Majority." 
  Radio Sandino's mobile unit had been setting up equipment to 
join the network at 1000, but the technicians received a 
last-minute order not to transmit. However, they were 
authorized to record the discussion held by Dr. Sergio Ramirez, 
FSLN directorate member Luis Carrion, and Commander Dora Maria 
Tellez. 
  Before the panel discussion began, and as we monitored the 
FSLN radio station, we heard a Radio Sandino announcer tell the 
station's mobile unit to modulate the signal. 
  Yesterday EL NUEVO DIARIO phoned Orlando Gomez, deputy 
director of Radio Sandino and one of the persons invited to the 
panel discussion, to ask him why the station had not broadcast 
the roundtable. A secretary said Gomez was not in his office. 
The time was a few minutes before noon. 
  The mysterious order to leave out a Sandinist sector forced 
the rest of the radio stations to continue the network, which 
was then headed by Radio El Pensamiento. The station's 
broadcast was affected by a "strange" interference in the 
telephone line used for the transmission. 
  Despite the mysterious order that silenced those who sponsor 
the renewal of Sandinism, the panel was broadcast by the 
following stations: Radio El Pensamiento, Radio Istmo, Radio 
Noticias, Radio Horizonte, Radio BB Stereo, Radio Fiesta, Radio 
America, Radio Stereo Sol, and Radio Universidad. 
<H5>  Development of the Roundtable </H5>
  During the panel discussion, the first to be broadcast by a 
large number of radio stations and held only a few hours before 
the opening of the FSLN Special Congress, Commander Luis Carrion 
referred to the charges against Commander Henry Ruiz for 
accepting the nomination to the post of FSLN secretary general. 
"It seems there are some comrades who think this is a crime or 
a sin," Carrion noted, while saying that in the past "Modesto" 
[Ruiz] was accused of being a "leftist" by the same people who 
are now accusing him of being a right-winger. "I think that is 
the main reason why this candidacy has so much support in the 
FSLN ranks. People see this as an option for unity in the 
congress." 
  Carrion indicated that a proposal began circulating this 
week 
and will be submitted to the congress to empower the Sandinist 
Assembly to appoint editorial boards for the Sandinist news 
media based on the one that emerged during an "ad hoc" assembly 
in Managua. 
  He said that if this proposal is submitted, the congress 
must 
define which media are FSLN media. "At any rate, we will ask 
the congress to clearly establish which media are Sandinist 
media and which are not, because there is confusion about some 
of them. One example is Radio Ya, the status of which is not 
defined. Rather than serving as an open platform for all 
Sandinists who wish to express their views, it is used as a tool 
of currents that have excluded "everyone who doesn't think like 
them." 
<H5>  FSLN's Behavior </H5>
  As Ramirez spoke about the FSLN's behavior, he discussed his 
party's previous ability to single-handedly control the armed 
institution, the government, and media organizations, but when 
the FSLN lost the 1990 elections, it continued to use the same 
methods it used as a clandestine party. 
  The FSLN has had a hard time adjusting to being a civilian 
opposition party that lacks the basic components of power, so it 
must begin an intense campaign to recover power through the only 
means available; the elections. 
  Sergio added: "I think the FSLN, as a political party with 
not only an outward intention of democracy but an internal 
democratic structure, must successfully face the challenge of 
the 1996 elections." He also added that his party must 
definitively end the hierarchical command structure. "I am not 
interested in discussing whether that method was necessary in 
the past," he added. 


<H5>      Good-Bye to Vanguardism </H5>
  Sergio said the FSLN can no longer call itself the 
"Nicaraguan Vanguard" because it makes no sense. It made sense 
during the armed conflict when people had to be led to an 
uprising. Now we must see the FSLN as a revolutionary party 
that is outwardly and inwardly democratic. 
  As for affiliation, Ramirez said "we cannot accept an FSLN 
with followers, members, associates, and supporters; that is, we 
cannot accept an FSLN that is like a train with first-, second-, 
third-, and fourth-class cars and even a caboose. 
  "All Sandinists must belong to one category; they must have 
the same duties and obligations. There cannot be a group of 
illuminati atop an ivory tower revealing the ideological truth 
to those on the ground who must only obey. That is not a 
winning party but a monarchic sect." 
  Regarding criticism by conservative and orthodox FSLN groups 
that those who favor party renewal are "bourgeois" or 
"bourgeoisie-friendly," Ramirez said those people have very 
peculiar concepts of what constitutes an offense. 
  "I cannot say for certain that someone who calls me a 
bourgeois is indeed a proletarian; life is no longer that easy. 
It is very complex because many social classes are represented 
in the FSLN. There are even independently wealthy people who are 
engaged in private activities." 
  The first phone interruption during the radio network took 
place when Sergio was answering questions from Allan Tefel Alba, 
one of the reporters officially invited to the discussion. The 
second interruption took place when Jose Esteban Quesada from 
the [Radio Sandino] "Events" newscast was speaking. 
<H5>  Sabotage </H5>
  Reporter Teresa Rios called attention to the sabotage of the 
FSLN renewal supporters and said that reporters from the 
orthodox-controlled media failed to attend the conference, which 
led her to wonder if there are two FSLN parties. 
  Our colleague's questions were answered by Deputy Dora Maria 
Tellez, who said she had no doubt that the outcome of the 
congress "would differ from what we are currently seeing. Now 
we see a group of companeros who resorted to certain methods of 
attack and epithets to defend their positions. I do not think 
congressmen will make the same decision. I think they will 
support unified positions." 
<H5>  Surprises in the Congress </H5>
  "I think the Congress will make the right decision about 
which path the FSLN must take to become a true alternative for 
the people and for their daily struggle to reach power. I am 
convinced congressmen will reject the sectarianism, the 
offenses, and the epithets that the overwhelming majority of 
Sandinists are rejecting, because no one will agree that 
'Modesto is a rightist,'" explained Tellez. 
  The deputy emphatically said that Commander Daniel Ortega, 
who heads the so-called Democratic Left, resorted to political 
intolerance, sectarianism, and attacks on all dissenting 
positions, a strategy that "hasn't harmed us but has harmed the 
FSLN." 
  "We have tried to avoid responding to the name-calling with 
more name-calling, but obviously there is an image we are 
projecting to the people. The important thing is that the FSLN 
congress come up with a winning electoral formula and a unified 
solution to face the government's neoliberal policies." 
  Dora Maria added that the Congress could be the right place 
for all of those who are resorting to name-calling "to correct 
themselves instead of confusing the FSLN rank and file. 
  "We want an open, broad, flexible, and tolerant FSLN, an 
FSLN 
that respects people's opinions. However, one group is 
proposing a closed and sectarian FSLN," concluded Deputy Tellez.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tomas Borge, president of the Sandinist </F>
National Liberation Front, FSLN, Congress, by unidentified 
reporter on 20 May; place not give; from the "Extravision" 
newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Borge] Several foreign delegations have arrived. 
Others will arrive this afternoon, and the remainder will arrive 
tomorrow. There is a large number of foreign delegations from 
many nations, from Europe. 
  [Reporter] How many delegations have arrived? 
  [Borge] More than 100. There is an impressive number of 
observers. Observers are precisely that: They observe. There 
are also invitees who have a right to speak out, who have been 
designated by territory. These [words indistinct] are full 
delegates to the Congress who have a right to speak and to vote. 
  My responsibility as president of the Congress, my 
obligation, is to be above any differences. That is my main 
responsibility. I must set aside all my opinions to lead the 
congress in an aboveboard, [word indistinct], fair, democratic 
manner, leaving no room for doubt. This is a very important 
national event. It goes without saying that I am not in favor 
of any faction. I do not favor factions. I say this before the 
Congress starts because I will reiterate it once the Congress 
begins and, if necessary, during the debates. As congress 
president, I must lead it in due form, but I also have the right 
to express my opinion. 
  I have the right to express my opinion and, as a matter of 
fact, I have expressed my opinion on Daniel Ortega's candidacy 
for FSLN secretary general. It was not an easy decision because 
I have seen many contradictions over the years. Unlike other 
comrades, some of whom are now confronting him, I have never 
flattered him. I have always made things perfectly clear, as 
Daniel himself can attest. 
  I have been critical of many actions, not just of Daniel's 
but of other comrades' as well. One such example is the time 
when the National Directorate decided to concentrate power -- 
under very special circumstances -- in the government's 
executive, even though the Directorate always participated in 
making the most important decisions. 
  From a historical point of view, I have had good, friendly 
relations with Henry Ruiz. He and I belonged to one of those 
tendencies. I must confess that I now regret having been a 
member of one of those tendencies. I would have liked to have 
been above the tendencies at those times, but such were the 
circumstances. But, [words indistinct] with Henry Ruiz over all 
these years I have had a good relationship with him. I could 
say that I am more of a friend to Henry Ruiz that to Daniel 
Ortega. When it comes to political decisions, however, one 
should not consider friendship but what is more suitable for the 
revolution. 
  I am totally convinced that beyond personal relations and 
beyond the differences we have had in the past, it is much more 
advisable for the FSLN to have Daniel Ortega as FSLN secretary 
general. Mind you, I have had more differences with Daniel 
Ortega than with Henry Ruiz. My friendship with Henry Ruiz is 
greater than with Daniel Ortega. 
  Daniel Ortega has a great deal of support in the FSLN. 
Moreover, he has demonstrated an enormous capacity for work and 
innovation. In my opinion, and contrary to what others say, he 
is the candidate for unity because he has the most support. He 
is the candidate that will bring us together. My common sense 
tells me this. The candidate of unity is not a candidate who 
causes too much controversy inside the FSLN, as is the case with 
my friend Commander Henry Ruiz. The candidate of unity is my 
comrade Daniel Ortega, about whom I cannot say that I am not his 
friend and his brother. I am Daniel's friend and his brother, 
but I have been closer to Henry Ruiz. Nevertheless, when the 
time comes to make a decision as an FSLN activist and as member 
of Congress, I favor Comrade Daniel Ortega.

  This is a special session of the Sandinist Congress. A total 
of 566 delegates and 170 guests were invited. There are 150 
international representatives from 80 countries here. [applause] 
Present here are delegates from Germany, Argentina, Austria, 
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, 
Korea, Costa Rica, the Republic of Cuba, Spain, the United 
States, France, the UK, Greece, Guatemala, The Netherlands, our 
neighboring Republic of Honduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
our dearest republic of Mexico, representatives of solidarity 
organizations here in Nicaragua, Norway, Palestine, the now 
democratic Republic of Panama, Portugal, Puerto Rico -- whose 
representatives are struggling for their country's independence, 
our friends in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Sweden, 
Switzerland, the always fraternal Uruguay, and the Republic of 
Vietnam. [applause follows the naming of each country; Cuba 
rfeceives a standing ovation] 
  My dear brothers, in addition to being a special session of 
the Congress, this is a special congress for political reasons. 
On very few occasions has a political event in this country 
raised so much expectation. I wonder what the reason is for so 
much expectation and interest. Nicaragua -- poor little 
Nicaragua -- is agonizing in a surrealistic crisis of 
unemployment, backwardness, poverty, lack of health, and 
something we never had before: hunger. We are now one of the 
poorest countries in the world. What this special congress 
decides can contribute to maintaining this poverty, endlessly, 
in a circle of hell. What this congress decides can also be the 
beginning of a national resurrection. All of you who are 
participating in this congress -- all of us and no one else -- 
have this tremendous historical responsibility. If the FSLN 
comes out deteriorated or divided, it will not be easy for us to 
defeat the enemies of the people. If we end up divided and 
deteriorated -- despite the earnest calls for unity we have 
heard here -- it will be impossible [to defeat our enemies]. 
We, the congress delegates and no one else, have this 
historical responsibility. Will personal greed prevail among 
us? Will the useless confrontations, the fireworks of 
selfishness prevail? Will the temptation of bending our knees 
before the enemy prevail? Will the arrogance, exclusion, 
self-idolatry, messianism prevail? Will anyone -- any one of us 
-- believe he is anointed by the Holy Spirit to destroy the 
FSLN? Or, on the contrary, will good sense, equity, 
selflessness, the fraternal embrace, love for our fatherland, 
identification with our sacred revolutionary roots, loyalty 
toward the copious rivers of blood of our glorious martyrs 
prevail? Will we Sandinists love each other more, or will we 
love our enemies more? 
  Someone once said one cannot love the people without hating 
their enemies. As of this moment, I urge you not to hate 
anyone, not even our enemies. If this call can serve any 
purpose, it should first encourage love among Sandinists. 
  And after the Congress, what? Let us all agree that this 
is a special congress, that this congress will delimit a border 
between the past and the future. After this congress, the only 
acceptable conclusion is an audacious and renewed political 
line; a political line that will have to reflect wisdom, 
flexibility, and firmness. We are forced to examine with 
telescopes and microscopes the possibilities of alliance, the 
prospects for a definitive national agreement. That 
flexibility, possible alliances, the search for national 
consensus which must [words indistinct] with the revolutionary 
principles. 
  After the congress is over, our agenda will give preeminence 
to the popular struggle against injustice, economic repression, 
administrative corruption, banditry, [word indistinct], and 
rancor. 
  After this congress -- I hope -- we will be richer in 
national dignity and more severe in resolutely demanding respect 
for our sovereignty; we will promote international friendship, 
strengthening the FSLN's relations with all political forces: 
the Socialist International, the Conference of Latin American 
Political Parties, the Sao Paolo Group. We will intensity our 
friendship with our historical friends. I am talking about 
Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Brazil, to 
mention just a few of our dear Latin American friends. I am 
talking about Europe, Asia, and Africa, now represented here. 
  After this congress we will be more enthusiastic in 
defending 
the just causes, not only in this forum, but in all forums. As 
a matter of principle, we are and will continue to be faithful 
to the cause of the fraternal and glorious people of Cuba. From 
this forum we joyfully greet the victory of the South African 
people and their great leader Nelson Mandela. [applause] From 
this rostrum, we extend our dignified and friendly hand -- with 
the pride of being Sandino's heirs and Carlos Fonseca's brothers 
-- to the U.S. Government, demanding respect, which when 
evident, will be fully shared. 
  After this congress, we will give our attention to peasants 
and will give youths a dignified and qualitative position. 
After this congress we will be even more staunch defenders of 
the struggles of the Indian peoples for respect of their 
legitimate rights; we will be more active in defending the 
struggle for equality between men and women, [applause] we will 
be more enthusiastic in the struggle for the unity of the Latin 
American peoples. 
  After this congress, we will vigorously seek a solution or 
will contribute to finding a solution to the distressing 
property problem. After this congress, as you shouted at the 
beginning, we will be more coherent, and will raise very high 
and seriously, and forever the indestructible unity of the FSLN. 
[applause] 
  My dear brothers, as the highest authority of the FSLN at 
this moment, I declare this FSLN Special Congress open. 
[applause]

<F P=106> [Speech by Jorge Shafik Handal, general coordinator of the </F>
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, on behalf of 
foreign delegations, before the Sandinist National Liberation 
Front, FSLN, Special Congress at the Olof Palme Convention 
Center in Managua on 20 May -- live] 
  [Text] Sandinist brothers and sisters; friends one and all; 
Nicaraguan brothers and sisters: 
  The FSLN and FMLN are two revolutionary forces, which arose 
amid vital, deep, heroic national and popular struggles. They 
were born from the longest, the most excruciating, and the most 
important historical convultions of our nations. This is why we 
are a real, genuine, and excluding political force in the 
forging of the present and the future of our countries. 
  To become what we are now, during the 1970s the FMLN and the 
FSLN endured dispersion, ideological struggles, and the 
emulation of strategies and tactics. This was followed by a 
process of rediscovery and reunification, which was the 
foundation of our success and final victory and our influence on 
society as a factor for progress. It was fortunate for the FSLN 
that the internal struggle of the 1970s only managed to produce 
three trends. These trends did not rupture the Sandinist 
foundations, and because of this, the movement's reunification 
process was a profound one. 
  In El Salvador, the struggle among revolutionary forces led 
to the creation of five revolutionary parties. The rediscovery 
of our ideals brought about an alliance of parties that waged 
the 12-year revolutionary war. We were, however, unable to come 
together as one. Once the war was over, we became a party of 
parties. It is easy to imagine the operational problems that 
this can create. 
  Now the FSLN and the FMLN are both living a renewed 
political 
and ideological struggle, which has flourished from our 
overturnings, shortcomings, and mistakes, and also from the 
crumbling of socialism in East Europe and the former USSR. The 
latter opened the way to an overwhelming and overpowering global 
anti-socialist feeling, bolstered a thousand times over by the 
unlimited proportions of modern communications. Having said 
this, we could say that we have completed the list of reasons 
for our current unity crisis. The fall of socialism gave us, 
however, freedom to think with our own minds and the ability to 
formulate our own way of thinking and our own ideology, based on 
our own reality; with much fewer distortions than those produced 
by centuries of ideological, political, and theoretical centrism 
around Europe. We must use this liberty and not run straight 
into one of the old-fashioned enclosures, where everything is 
prepared for us. 
  We are so unfortunate. We must draft a new revolutionary 
philosophy and simultaneously defend ourselves from the 
pressures of conservatives, who have certainly modernized 
themselves but who are the essentially same, while poverty 
multiplies itself and the growing unsatisfied social needs 
demand solutions here and now. 
  Poor little us, because we were unable to distinguish 
between 
ideology, theory, and politics. That is why we need to wage a 
political and social struggle to provide the necessary solutions 
to the theoretical issues and to the renewal of the 
revolutionary ideology. 
  "Today, as yesterday, we revolutionaries need this debate 
among ourselves, but we also need our strategies and tactics to 
be put to the test. This is decisive. However, it is much more 
dangerous to do this today than it was yesterday, because we are 
now facing a contender who is utilizing tactics of triumphant 
psychology, with even more material, political, theoretical, and 
ideological resources. Instead of being a process of creative 
development, the result could turn out to be the temptation to 
fill this power vacuum, following that well-known basic law of 
physics. Should we then remain immobile? No. Immobility is 
not the strength of a revolution. The answer is in our own 
history: Our strength is in our unity." Our unity, hopes, and 
the people's strength rely on our unity as well. The 
possibility for us to remain faithful to the ideals of freedom, 
justice, and social progress and to the revolutionary ideals 
depend on the people's strength. The possibility for us to 
measure our innovations, strategies, and tactics also depends on 
the people's strength. Today we now need a more intelligent 
union than yesterday. We need a more open, more flexible union 
in which each current of thought can express its identity and 
assume its role. We need a union in which each current of 
thought can prove to itself and to others its successes and 
virtues. We need a more intelligent and flexible unity than the 
one the FSLN had in the 1970's. Unity is indispensable to 
resist, to consolidate ourselves, to move ahead, and to renew 
ourselves and to continue being revolutionaries. 
  With this outlook in mind, we greet the victorious African 
National Congress and President Nelson Mandela, the pride of 
humanity. He is an example of revolutionary skill. We greet so 
many other leftist parties and movements that have found the 
path to understand their new role, to maintain their unity, and 
to come out ahead. 
  Receive, my brothers, the hug of all FMLN members without 
exception. From our hearts, we hope this FSLN congress will 
have the greatest success. The FSLN needs it, it wants it, and 
the Nicaraguan people expect it. The FMLN also needs the 
success of the FSLN congress. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Speech by Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the Sandinist </F>
National Liberation Front, FSLN, at the opening session of the 
FSLN Special Congress at the Olof Palme Convention Center in 
Managua -- live] 
  [Text] Companeros and companeras; delegates; national and 
international observers invited to the FSLN Special Congress; 
Sandinist brothers; Nicaraguan brothers: In this month of May, 
we commemorated the 99th anniversary of the birth of Augusto 
Cesar Sandino, our general of free men. On 4 May, we celebrated 
the Day of National Dignity. May is the month when the rainy 
season begins. May is the month of mothers. It is the month in 
which we are holding this Sandinist Congress. 
  When we proposed this Special Congress, we did it with the 
certainty that it will serve to consolidate and unite Sandinism 
around its program and statutes. This way the people will be 
able to count on a Sandinist Front that is united around 
revolutionary principles and programs. 
  This is part of a process in which ideas have been presented 
with complete freedom. This has been a rich process because of 
the many proposals advanced at local assemblies and forums. 
This is a process in which self-criticism is necessary, because 
this process is being conducted in the fraternal, constructive, 
and revolutionary way in which we are obligated to conduct it. 
  We are certain that the FSLN will emerge from this special 
session with strengthened democratic unity. Under these 
circumstances, we will be promoting internal changes that will 
enable us to promote changes in favor of the entire nation. In 
this way, we Sandinists will be returning to the people, who are 
our fountainhead and raison d'etre. 
  In a world subjected to the neoliberal offensive that is 
proclaiming the end of history, trying to bury the noble ideals 
that moved mankind to search for a more just, free, and 
equitable world, the people are resisting, the people are not 
surrendering, and the people are achieving victories, such as 
the one secured recently by the heroic people of South Africa. 
The people want changes. This necessarily means seeking new 
paths and alternatives to face neoliberalism. An example of 
this is the resistance of the heroic people of Cuba, subject to 
an illegal policy of U.S. imperialism, which violates the human 
rights of all its people and which maintains the blockade and 
embargo against our Cuban brothers. 
  The people of our America also are resisting. They are 
resorting to the most extensive forms of struggle. This 
includes the Haitian people, who see how their democratic 
aspirations have been shunned. In the Middle East, the 
Palestinians are increasing their efforts to fully recover their 
territory, and the people of Libya and Iraq are resisting the 
effects of a blockade imposed by hegemonic interests. 
  In the face of neoliberalism, the struggle for the survival 
of mankind and the struggle for the environment are objectives 
that are being strongly defended by the people in both the North 
and South of our planet. 
  In a world that demands changes to save mankind, we 
Sandinists must update and therefore enrich our program. We 
must promote organizational transformations and therefore enrich 
our statutes. We must strengthen the leadership by opening the 
doors of our organization to everyone who may voluntarily want 
to adhere to our principles and programs. By strengthening the 
leadership in the rank and file, we would be strengthening the 
leadership of the organization and we would be returning to the 
people. To do this, it is necessary to integrate Nicaragua's 
young people and its women. 
  The front has been a factor for change in Nicaraguan 
society, 
which allowed us to ascend from a guerrilla column that in 1963 
carried out an incursion in Bocay to become a national and 
popular insurrection which, on 19 July 1979, overthrew the 
Somozist dictatorship. 
  While in the government, we always promoted initiatives and 
worked for the strengthening of a de jure state, despite the war 
the U.S. Administration of Ronald Reagan launched against us. 
This earned us the respect and admiration of people from around 
the world and nurtured solidarity with Nicaraguans in the most 
remote places in the world. Our revitalized thoughts made 
democracy possible and led to profound changes -- agrarian 
reform, the literacy campaign, and the defense of sovereignty. 
  This open-mindedness allowed us to defend at the proper 
moment the privatization of state enterprises in favor of 
workers, retired Army and Government Ministry officials, and 
demobilized Resistance people. This open mindedness also led to 
the autonomy law in favor of our Atlantic coast brothers, and 
today we must acknowledge the autonomous nature of the FSLN in 
the autonomous northern Atlantic and southern Atlantic regions, 
just as the companeros from the coast have proposed in recent 
assemblies and congresses. 
  Now we have to put our imagination and our initiatives to 
the 
test to overcome the errors we have undoubtedly committed and to 
create plans to work for new and better forms of organization to 
recover the trust and credibility of Sandinists, both with and 
without credentials, and together with them, we must work to win 
the confidence of the Nicaraguan people as we defend their 
interests, carry out daily efforts, and work to recapture the 
government in the 1996 elections. By doing this, we would be 
returning to the people. 
  The current neoliberal government has led the country to 
economic stagnation, unemployment, and the disintegration of the 
Nicaraguan family and society. In the face of a profound crisis 
like the one burdening the Nicaraguan people, the front 
represents a factor of national stability and hope for a change. 
  The reconstruction of the country and a national program 
concerned with the people will be possible only with the 
participation of all national economic, social, and political 
forces. No sector in the country will escape the destructive 
impact of neoliberal policies. This is why as soon as this 
Special Congress concludes we must again take the initiative to 
implement a national unity program. We must also seek support 
for the workers who demand a new labor code. We must seek broad 
agreement to demand respect for Laws 85, 86, and 88, which 
benefit more than 200,000 families, to secure the legalization 
and registration of these properties, just like the properties 
that have been transferred since 1990 as a result of the 
privatization process, which has benefited popular sectors. 
  We have to support the bonuses law to grant satisfactory 
compensation to claimants when the law supports their claims, 
including U.S. citizens. Therefore, U.S. citizens and 
Nicaraguans who took U.S. citizenship will have to submit to 
Nicaraguan laws. There can be no exceptions. The government has 
the obligation of defending Nicaragua's self-determination 
rights and reject foreign pressure. 
  We Sandinists must support the workers, the peasants, coffee 
producers, ranchers, the producers of basic grains, and all 
sectors that have been affected and are demanding that the 
government change its economic policy to create conditions in 
favor of economic recovery, production, and the creation of jobs. 
  We Sandinists must work for the modernization of the state 
through the constitutional reforms being reviewed by the 
National Assembly. We Sandinists must promote a broad national 
movement for a long-term social and economic program that, with 
the support of all the Nicaraguans, might make possible a 
national solution to the crisis and bring about the arrival of 
true peace and stability. 
  In our pluralist and democratic Nicaragua, there have been 
two elections -- the one in 1984 and the one in 1990. On these 
occasions, the Sandinists' respect for the will of the people 
was tested. The outcome is that we peacefully turned over the 
government on 25 April 1990. 
  National elections are scheduled for November 1996, and we 
Sandinists must better prepare ourselves for the elections by 
first assuming a policy of self-criticism that will allow us to 
listen to one another and remedy our differences on time. We 
have made many mistakes. After the defeat in the elections, 
different groups emerged and then moved in their own directions. 
This created even more contradictions. Not everything was well 
done even though people were full of goodwill and were concerned 
about the problems of the nation. To achieve victory in the 
1996 elections, it is necessary to resolve our internal matters 
by updating our programs and bylaws. We have to take on the 
appropriate revolutionary discipline. We have to show 
fraternity and respect for one another and for the people. By 
going back to the people and by holding an electoral reform 
debate that can promote national unity, the Sandinists are going 
to achieve victory with the Nicaraguan people's vote in the 1996 
elections. 
  Brothers, to achieve the objectives demanded by Nicaraguans 
in this historic period, we have to reclaim Sandinist ethics and 
morale. We have to reclaim the values that have supported the 
great causes of humanity, solidarity, honesty, humility, and 
respect for the poverty in which our people have been living. 
These are the values we have to rescue in order that the 
Sandinists can face the venom toted by the neoliberals inside 
their bags that are chock-full of jaded values such as 
individualism, selfishness, and the save-yourself philosophy. 
  We have to undergo a deep test of self-criticism that can 
shake up our consciences. We cannot tolerate more abuses and 
violations. We need to come out with our heads held high and 
with our souls in intact to defend the rights of the people. 
  Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: We have tried to 
give the best of our lives to the defense of freedom, justice, 
and the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan people. We -- men and 
women together -- met one another along a path originally marked 
by our General Sandino. The National Directorate of the FSLN 
assumed the commitment of those who were willing to wage a 
profound battle. Many brothers fell with the silence of heroes, 
who not only said they would die for the fatherland, but 
actually did die for the fatherland. Among those who fell were 
Carlos Fonseca, Santos Lopez, Jorge Navarro, Silvio Mayorga, 
Luis Humberto Cruz, Casimiro Sotelo, Julio Buitrago, Oscar 
Turcio, Ricardo Morales, Jacinto Hernandez, Filemon Rivera, Jose 
Benito Escobar, [words indistinct], Eduardo Contreras, and 
Carlos Nunez. 
  Following the difficult times of the Somoza dictatorship and 
the defense of the revolution, the members of the FSLN National 
Directorate, men of flesh and bone, making correct and incorrect 
decisions via both our vices and virtues, and yet full of 
revolutionary love and passion, we have tried to do our best for 
the people. We have tried not to betray ourselves or to 
surrender. We have decided to continue fighting until we 
achieve a free, just, and peaceful fatherland -- a fatherland of 
which our General Sandino dreamed and for which our heroes and 
martyrs spilled their blood. 
  Long live the unity of the FSLN! Long live the unity of the 
Nicaraguan people! Sandino lives! The struggle continues! 
Free fatherland or death! [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Edgard Barberena S.] </F>
  [Text] The "Helms-Gonzalez" Amendment, drafted to pressure 
world governments to return or indemnify the confiscated 
properties of U.S. citizens, has already cleared all legislative 
hurdles in the United States, but President Bill Clinton has yet 
to sign or veto it. 
  This was said by National Assembly President Luis Humberto 
Guzman, who is just back from Washington, D.C., where he met 
with congressmen, as well as with high-ranking officials in the 
Agency for International Development and other international 
financial organizations for discussions of Nicaragua's foreign 
debt. 
  When asked about statements by the Violeta Chamorro 
administration's "strong man," Antonio Lacayo, on the amendment 
that the president's son-in-law believes concerns only the 
"big-footed American caitudos [pejorative term for some 
Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. citizens]" but that will 
not affect Nicaraguan programs, the National Assembly leader 
said the U.S. legislature is studying the possibility that the 
U.S. President might deem the law unenforceable due to a 
conflict of interests in that nation." [no opening quotation 
mark as published] 
  Guzman said that several of the people he met in Washington, 
D.C. "told me they lack the authority to prevent enforcement of 
the law." 
  Although the government has tried to minimize the effects 
that the "Helms-Gonzalez" Amendment may have on the country, 
Guzman stressed the difficulties that enforcement of this U.S. 
law may create with regard to foreign aid. 
  The parliament leader pointed out: "Regardless of the U.S. 
congressmen's and Government's positions, the property issue is 
a very delicate and important issue for all Nicaraguans, who 
must resolve it on our own." 
  Expanding on the case of the "American caitudos," Guzman 
recalled the existence of several guidelines of international 
law which stipulate that the owners' nationality at the time of 
confiscation should be the benchmark. 
  "Therefore, the number of U.S. citizens claiming property 
will be reduced to only those who were U.S. citizens in 1979, 
not after that. Otherwise, we would never resolve this issue 
because every day there are more Nicaraguans who acquire U.S. 
citizenship."

<F P=106> [By Luis Enrique Vasquez] </F>
  [Text] Panama City, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Victims of the 1989 
U.S. military invasion of Panama will exert international 
pressure in an effort to force Washington to pay them 
compensation, it was announced today by the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
  Gilma Gloria Camargo told NOTIMEX the OAS Human Rights 
Commission will take the case before the international community 
as a way to exert pressure on the United States. The lawyer 
arrived in this capital to inform the victims on the status of 
their claims and to brief others who were affected by the 
conflict on the steps they need to take to legitimize their 
claims. 
  Payment to the first 70 victims was estimated at $250 
million, but there are 1,500 depositions to date, which 
represent more than $1 billion in compensation, Camargo said. 
Camargo, one of the Panamanian lawyers at the Center for 
Constitutional Rights Headquarters in New York, said the victims 
are claiming loss of human life; injuries; and the destruction 
of homes, household effects, and businesses. 
  "The United States might refuse to pay for damages because 
it 
has not subscribed to some human rights agreements. 
Nevertheless, we believe that the commission can make a 
recommendation to the OAS court and that we can exert 
international pressure," Camargo added. 
  The lawyer said the pressure may be exerted in a few days, 
after the Inter-American Human Rights Commission [CIDH] 
publishes the acceptance of the Panamanian complaint in its 
annual report. The OAS accepted the complaint in December, but 
the United States later requested a review of the case. 
However, the complaint was ratified by the OAS, Camargo 
explained. 
  Camargo insists: "The United States always says other 
countries should abide by international law. Therefore, it also 
should abide by the law in Panama's case." 
  "Only noncombatant" civilians, who were in this country 
during the 20 December 1989 armed invasion to oust General 
Manuel Antonio Noriega, "qualify" as plaintiffs, she noted. 
Those who meet the requirements may get OAS application forms 
by presenting the necessary evidence at the Panamanian Human 
Rights Commission offices. These forms will then "be sent to 
the Center of Constitutional Rights in New York," she concluded. 
  According to human rights organizations' estimates, the 
armed 
intervention cost approximately 2,000 lives and $1 billion in 
damage. U.S. courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have 
rejected until now accusations made by Panamanian victims of the 
invasion.

  [Text] The United States "is interested in protecting its 
products, and this is why "it is accusing Panama of being a 
mecca for forgeries of well-known brands in the Colon Free 
Zone," according to Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) Deputy 
Elias Castillo, chairman of the Education, Culture, and Sports 
Committee. [quotation marks as published] 
  Castillo indicated that the problem stems from "the lack of 
seriousness on the part of the authorities and businessmen" who 
directly or indirectly are allowing counterfeiting in the Free 
Zone. 
  "To prevent these kinds of problems, the Education Comittee 
has drafted a bill, which was approved in a first debate and 
submitted for the approval of the full Legislative Assembly," 
Castillo noted. 
  Referring to the sale of forgeries of well-known products 
taking place in the Free Zone, the PRD deputy indicated, "the 
authorities have to convey their seriousness to the manager in 
order that he can project this Free Zone policy," and, in turn, 
disprove the charges made by the top U.S. commerce 
representative. 
  He added that the U.S. charges against Panama "show the U.S. 
Government and Embassy desperately want Panama to approve the 
copyright law as soon as possible," which punishes the forging 
of well-known products. 
  The law against forgeries and other related intellectual 
property rights infringements contains approximately 120 
articles, which the Education Committee reviewed with officials 
of the Commerce and Industries and Education Ministries. 
  LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA unsuccessfully tried by every means 
possible to interview Luz Celeste de Davis, director of the 
Industrial Registry Office of the Commerce and Industries 
Ministry, on the charges made by the U.S. authorities.

  [Text] Ignacio Gutierrez Pita, Mexican ambassador to 
Panama, announced yesterday that his government will improve and 
strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations with the 
administration of Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez 
Balladares. 
  Gutierrez Pita told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that several 
important cooperation accords are already being discussed. He 
added that conversations with business groups from his country 
are underway to get them to participate in projects in Panama. 
  The diplomat revealed that he has already met with Dr. Perez 
Balladares and Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo. 
He said "it is very positive since the day following his 
proclamation, the Panamanian president-elect has confirmed his 
interest in expanding and enriching his relationship with 
Mexico." 
  Among the projects Mexican companies are interested in or 
already are participating in are the Esti Hydroelectric project, 
the Northern Highway, and the widening of the Panama City-Colon 
road. 
  In addition, contacts have been made with tourism promotion 
enterprises. These enterprises have expressed special interest 
in the Fort Amador project. 
  Mexico is interested in helping to resolve the problem of 
public transportation and taxis in our country, and various 
options have been offered to finance the purchase of buses and 
taxis. It is only expected that local banks show interest in 
financing such projects by offering credit lines. 
  Regarding the possibility of Panama joining NAFTA, Gutierrez 
Pita said, "it would be premature to speak of accords, 
particularly since the new government will not assume office 
until 1 September. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  The ambassador warned he "only" discussed "with Dr. Perez 
Balladares and Lewis Galindo a work program that could be 
pursued following the presidential inauguration."

  [Text] Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres and 
Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares met 
yesterday in San Jose and agreed to join efforts during their 
respective administrations to fight drug trafficking and to 
adopt measures to improve their commercial relations. 
  Perez Balladares traveled to Costa Rica with Foreign 
Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo on an invitation by 
fellow Social Democrat Jose Maria Figueres, with whom he met for 
about one and one-half hours. 
  In a news conference at the Costa Rican Presidential Palace, 
Figueres and Perez Balladares said they talked about four 
specific issues: bilateral trade, social investments at the 
common border, creation of a mixed-bilateral commercial 
association, and the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Both presidents agreed the sovereignty of their respective 
nations is violated when they are used by drug traffickers for 
their illicit trade. 
  "We agreed to carry out efforts, in a decisive and 
definitive 
manner, to control drug smuggling as a mutual responsibility," 
Figueres stated. 
  Meanwhile, Perez Balladares said the issue of drug 
trafficking is fundamental. He affirmed that the struggle 
against drug trafficking may result in the creation of liaison 
and joint cooperation offices, not only with the United States, 
but also with all countries that feel the need to cooperate in 
this matter. 
  Figueres' National Liberation Party and Perez Balladares' 
PRD 
[Democratic Revolutionary Party] assisted each other during the 
elections in their respective nations. Both presidents were 
classmates at the University of Notre Dame in the United States. 
  The presidents expressed their interest in building a 
permanent commission formed by the two countries' governments 
and private enterprise to promote economic, social, and 
commercial development along the Costa Rican-Panamanian border.

  [Text] Panama's President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, 
speaking in San Jose, Costa Rica, declared that fulfillment of 
the Panama Canal Treaties is in the best interests of Panama and 
the United States and that no U.S. representative has indicated 
to him that the provisions of the Canal Treaties should be 
change. 
  Perez Balladares was accompanied by his future Foreign 
Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo, his adviser Jose Luis Sosa, and 
Samuel Lewis Navarro at a joint news conference with Costa Rican 
President Jose Maria Figueres, with whom he met at the 
government palace during a visit in which they discussed 
bilateral topics. 
  Referring to the Treaty's fulfillment, he explained that the 
U.S. military presence will end on 31 December 1999 and that the 
bases will cease to exist on Panamanian territory. "For 
Panamanians, the return of the Canal and surrounding areas, as 
well as the administration of the Canal, are not open for 
discussion," Perez said. 
  But he did admit that the United States and Panama could 
associate for other purposes. "We could say that the United 
States, Panama, and the world have a common enemy in 
narcotraffickers." 
  According to Perez, the new Panamanian Government will be 
willing to discuss associating with other world nations in the 
antinarcotics struggle but noted that this does not mean 
retaining the military bases. 
  Regarding the elimination of the Army's existence from the 
text of the Constitution, he made it clear that he is determined 
to end any chance that military regimes could recur. 
  He told journalists that he had agreed with President 
Guillermo Endara on introducing into the Legislative Assembly a 
list of constitutional reforms, which includes eliminating any 
vestige of the National Guard (Army) from the Constitution. 
  On the topic of Central American integration, he said that 
although there are common points of agreement between the two 
countries, from an economic standpoint Panama harbors some fears 
regarding its possible integration with Central America. 
  In Perez's opinion, undoubtedly very good intentions will 
prompt a continuation of the dialogue with President Figueres to 
strengthen ties between the two countries. He said he would 
leave this topic, which he described as "very technical," for 
future Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman to study.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, May 21 (CNA) -- An Argentine Navy 
corvette shot at a Taiwan fishing vessel on Friday [20 May], 
damaging it with machine-gun and cannon fire after the vessel 
refused to halt after being caught poaching in Argentine waters, 
an Argentine Navy news release said Friday. 
  The communique said the vessel, which was sighted fishing 
160 
miles off the coast of San Julian Friday morning, was initially 
identified as the Hin Van Sing, but on closer inspection the 
Navy noticed that the ship's name was different from the one 
painted on its lifeboats. Suspecting that the boat was poaching, 
the corvette ordered it to stop so it could be inspected. 
  The fishing boat ignored the command and took off in a 
northeasterly direction toward the Falkland Islands, with the 
corvette in hot pursuit, prompting the gunfire. The fishing boat 
was reportedly hit in the hull, and was losing fuel as the 
Argentine Navy continued to trail it. 
  The vessel was expected to be forcibly intercepted and 
boarded Saturday. 
  An agency for several fishing vessels from Taiwan in 
Argentina, however, said Saturday that, based on information it 
received from an Argentina naval base in the southern part of 
Argentina, it had determined the fishing boat was Korean. 
  The Taiwan Tuna Fishery Association also said that no 
fishing 
boat registered with the association is operating off the 
Argentine coast, nor is any boat named the Hin Van Sing 
registered with it. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry in Taipei said ROC [Republic 
of China] officials stationed near San Julian would investigate 
the incident. 
  The government will offer necessary legal assistance and 
medical care for boat crew members, ministry officials said. 
They also called on Taiwan fishing boats to adhere to 
international laws when fishing away from Taiwan.

  [Text] Neither the intervention of the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] leadership, nor an appeal to 
congressional corporatism could free Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro from 
being dismissed by the Chamber of Deputies. 
  During a 12-hour session, former Chamber of Deputies 
President Pinheiro was stripped of his congressional mandate by 
a vote of 296 to 139; 24 lawmakers abstained. 
  The Federal Supreme Court [STF] turned down a request for a 
court injunction filed by Pinheiro, who wanted to suspend his 
trial at the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Justice Carlos Mario Veloso reported at his office that the 
investigations requested by Pinheiro could be conducted only 
during the trial. 
  Ibsen Pinheiro also wanted the STF to annul a decision by 
the 
Constitution and Justice Commission, which recommended his 
dismissal.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Lessa] </F>
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 19 May (AE) -- In a lecture given at 
the Heavy Construction Association, the War College [ESG] 
commander, Brigadier Sergio Xavier Ferolla, today defended 
several points of the Workers Party [PT] program. Among these 
points are the expansion of the domestic market and the state 
monopoly over strategic economic areas. Endorsing the PT line, 
Ferolla attacked economic neoliberal proposals and 
privatization. Attending the lecture were some heavy 
construction heavyweights such as Emilio Odebrecht and Sergio 
Andrade. The latter is director of the Andrade Gutierrez company. 
  Ferolla said that, taking into account the Armed Forces' 
viewpoint, he endorses many points of the PT program. "In 
general, the program is correct," he said. He denied, however, 
that he is going to support the PT. He said: "My party is 
Brazil." He added that "there can be no problems if they are 
defending sound ideas." He noted that the party that best 
reflects his own ideas is the Communist Party of Brazil. "This 
is what democracy is all about," he said. 
  Ferolla provoked surprise among the businessmen when he made 
a historical correction. He said: "Many people believe the ESG 
was responsible for the 1964 military movement, but that was not 
the case at all." He noted that former President Castello 
Branco, who took courses at the ESG when he was a colonel, was 
an advocate of democracy. He also denied allegations that the 
ESG's creation had been inspired by the United States. He said: 
"We always have been concerned about formulating a national 
plan." 
  In defending the domestic market's expansion, Ferolla said 
he 
is not among the 10 million Brazilians who can afford to buy a 
new car. "Just think that if we could increase this figure by a 
factor of seven we would have a market equal to that of Japan," 
he said. "Our main strength lies in the size of our market." 
  Ferolla criticized the opening of the economy to foreign 
capital and the Argentine privatization program. He said: "They 
sold Argentine Airlines to the Spanish airline Iberia and the 
Argentine telephone company to Italian and French state-owned 
companies. If we applied legislation here similar to that 
enacted by the United States to protect its economy, they would 
characterize us as xenophobes."

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- A report on Conflicts in the 
Countryside, made by the [Catholic Church] Land Pastoral 
Committee, shows that last year, 391,128 people were involved in 
545 conflicts in the countryside, 252,236 of whom were in 
disputes over 3,221,252 hectares of land. The document, which 
was made public on 18 May in Rio de Janeiro, also shows that 
67,031 men and women were involved in 92 conflicts as a result 
of the drought, demanding the opening of emergency job fronts 
and welfare payments, and illegally occupying towns in search of 
food in northeast Brazil. Illegal land occupations were carried 
out by 19,092 families, while 19,940 people were registered as 
carrying out slave work in 15 states, including Rio de Janeiro. 
The greatest incidence of slave work was registered in five 
farms in Para State. 
  The report states that 52 people were murdered and 37 others 
were victims of murder attempts in the whole country. As for 
death threats, the document states that 154 people were 
threatened with death, including peasant leaders, landowners, 
members of Congress, a judge, and a prosecutor. Even Bishop 
Pedro Casaldaliga, from Sao Felix de Araguia, Mato Grosso, was 
threatened with death, according to the document.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 19 
May. 
  Average fuel prices were increased 18.11 percent on 14 May. 
After conversion of fuel prices into real value units, prices 
will be adjusted on a weekly basis until the circulation of the 
new currency on 1 July. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 12 May 94 Economy and Business Section p B1) 
  Although the level of Brazilian exports went down during the 
first three months of the year, it recovered in April and 
totalled $3.6 billion. Compared to the same month last year, 
this is a 20.8 percent increase. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO 
in Portuguese 12 May 94 Section 2 p 3) 
  Brazilian exports to Argentina from January to March 
totalled 
$891.4 million, which represents 70.5 percent of the Brazilian 
exports to Common Market of the South countries. Brazilian 
exports to Paraguay decreased from 20.3 percent in 1993 to 17.2 
percent this year and totalled $217.9 million. Similarly, 
exports to Uruguay decreased from 15 percent to 12.3 percent 
during the same period and totalled $154.8 million. (Sao Paulo 
FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 12 May 94 Section 2 p 2) 
  Federal tax revenue in Sao Paulo in April totalled $2.32 
billion. It was 32 percent higher than the amount collected 
during the same month last year, and 11 percent higher than 
March's $2.09 billion. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 
12 May 94 p 5) 
  The Brazilian stock market lost nearly $2.3 billion in March 
and April as a result of the political and economic instability 
in the country, as well as the increase in U.S. interest rates. 
Stock market expert Eduardo Moraes said the losses also can be 
attributed to the withdrawal of foreign investors from the stock 
market because they were responsible for about 30 percent of the 
financial operations in the field. Moraes added that stock 
market investors were frustrated by the end of the 
constitutional reform, the apparent failure of former Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential campaign, and 
the privatization program's slow implementation. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1805 GMT 13 May 94) 
  Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal reported that as a result 
of the government having to pay two salaries to public employees 
in the same month, the budget had a 1.6 trillion real cruzeiros 
deficit in April. The overall Treasury revenue in April totalled 
5.058 trillion real cruzeiros and expenditures totalled 6.692 
trillion. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 14 May 
94 Business and Economy Section p B6) 
  According to Petrobras, Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, 
national oil and liquid gas production in April totalled an 
average 697,237 barrels per day, i.e., 17,604 more barrels per 
day than in March. Petrobras said natural gas production 
totalled 20.1 million cubic meters. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO in Portuguese 17 May 94 Section 2 p 2) 
  The federal government granted 100 to 325 percent salary 
bonuses to Planalto Palace military employees. Civilian 
household chief Henrique Hargreaves said the increase seeks to 
level the bonuses paid to the military with those for the other 
public employees. Claudio Santana, director of the Federal 
Public Employees Union-Federal District, believes it is one more 
discriminatory act by the government. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in 
Portuguese 18 May 94 p 9)

  [Text] Santiago, 20 May (EFE) -- Upon his return today 
from Buenos Aires where he met his Argentine counterpart, 
Fernando Petrella, Chilean Foreign Relations Under Secretary 
Jose Miguel Insulza noted the number of similar viewpoints 
shared by Chile and Argentina regarding bilateral and 
multilateral issues. 
  Insulza stated that in the multilateral field the two 
countries share very similar viewpoints regarding the problem in 
Haiti, the hemispheric summit in Miami called by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, and the upcoming OAS meeting. 
  Regarding the Haitian crisis, the Chilean Foreign Ministry 
stated that it recognizes the constitutional Haitian Government 
headed by President Jean Bertrand Aristides and recognizes as 
its representative the current charge d'affaires in Santiago, 
Guy Pierre Andre, who this week publicly repudiated the new de 
facto government installed by the coupist military. 
  In the bilateral field, Insulza said important progress was 
made in this area during his visit to Buenos Aires and that the 
Argentine Government has voiced its interest in Chile's 
expressed desire to seek a commercial agreement with the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur). 
  The Chilean under secretary, who did not rule out the 
possibility that Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will 
make a proposal in this regard during his visit to Buenos Aires 
on 8 June, said: "The Argentine representatives expressed full 
support for the Chilean desire and we hope to reach an agreement 
in the next few days." 
  Moreover, Jose Miguel Insulza announced that in view of the 
next meeting Presidents Carlos Menem and Eduardo Frei will hold 
in Santiago in August, it has been agreed to establish a joint 
committee that will be in charge of assessing the legal and 
bureaucratic obstacles that still hinder the fulfillment of 
previous agreements, especially in the commercial field. 
  Insulza added that the presidents believe the agreements 
already signed by the two countries are enough for an important 
and deep-rooted binational integration process and that the 
problem boils down to bureaucratic and legal obstacles in the 
two countries that prevent them from working in a more efficient 
manner.

    [Editorial Report] Two public opinion polls published 
recently in Santiago LA NACION show high approval ratings for 
the Patricio Aylwin and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle governments and 
indicate popular concern about corruption and the transition to 
democracy. 
<H5>  CERC Poll </H5>
  The results of a poll conducted at the beginning of April by 
the Center for the Study of Contemporary Reality (CERC), of the 
Christian Humanism Academy University, were published on 9 
April. The report did not include any information on how the 
poll was conducted. 
  Although 86.2 percent considered democracy the best 
political 
system, 75.1 percent expected it to be effective in solving 
Chile's problems. Regarding the transition "from dictatorship to 
democracy", 60.5 percent thought it has not been completed, with 
16.7 percent saying its end depended on Army Commander in Chief 
General Augusto Pinochet's retiring, 9.9 percent on solving the 
problem of the missing persons and "finding out the truth," 5.4 
percent on enacting constitutional reforms, and 5.1 percent on 
"forgetting the past." 
  The approval ratings of both the Aylwin and Frei 
administrations at the start of their terms exceeded their vote 
percentages, which the CERC researchers explain as being due to 
the public's positive attitude toward any legitimate government 
rather than support for a specific government. In this poll, the 
Aylwin administration received a retrospective approval rating 
of 85 percent. Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley was considered 
the best minister, with 25.5 percent, followed by Interior 
Minister Enrique Krauss with 11 percent, while Defense Minister 
Patricio Rojas was considered the worst with 7.6 percent. 
  For the Frei administration, 73.5 percent of the respondents 
declared that they were supporters, and Frei received an 
84-percent approval rating overall. The researchers note that 
Frei's rating does not seem to be affected by the controversy 
surrounding Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange's 
alleged involvement in a case of human rights violations in 1985. 
  In answer to open-ended but unspecified questions about who 
the most important leaders of the Coalition of Parties for 
Democracy (CPPD) were, apart from Frei, Public Works Minister 
Ricardo Lagos received 30.1 percent, followed "at a great 
distance" by Senate President Gabriel Valdes at 8.3 percent and 
Interior Minister German Correa at 3.4 percent. In the 
opposition, National Renewal (RN) President Andres Allamand 
obtained 32.3 percent, followed by former RN senator Sergio 
Onofre Jarpa with 5.5 percent. 
  When asked questions about the issue of corruption, more 
respondents thought there was corruption during the Pinochet 
regime (60 percent) than during the Aylwin administration (52 
percent). When comparing the public and private sectors, 82.9 
percent responded that the problem of corrupion was "serious or 
very serious" in the public sector, compared with 70.5 percent 
for the private sector. When asked where there was the most 
corruption in the public sector, 12.5 percent cited municipal 
governments, followed by courts and judges with 11.2 percent, 
and Codelco (Copper Corporation) with 8.8 percent. 
<H5>  Adimark Poll </H5>
  A survey taken by the Adimark polling company in the 
country's major cities between 4 and 18 March and published in 
Santiago LA NACION on 26 March revealed that optimism about the 
economy had increased. Fully 58 percent of the respondents 
thought their economic situation would improve in the coming 
year, compared to 45.4 percent in the December Adimark poll. 
Asked which problems the government should devote the greatest 
efforts to, 55.8 percent named health care, with crime at 49.7 
percent. 
  Aylwin received a 69-percent approval rating, compared with 
51.4 percent in December and 73.6 percent in June 1990. His 
approval rating was higher among women, those above age 55, and 
independents. He received the highest scores for handling of 
foreign relations, followed by management of the economy and 
relations with the Armed Forces. The issues on which he received 
the lowest ratings were crime, terrorism, handling of 
corruption, and the health and environmental sectors. 
  With respect to the new Frei administration, 69 percent of 
the respondents were optimistic while 10 percent were 
pessimistic. Among the CPPD leadership, Frei received a 
44.3-percent rating and Lagos 13 percent. Of the opposition 
figures, Allamand received the best evaluation with 57 percent, 
followed "very closely" by Independent Democratic Union (UDI) 
leader Carlos Bombal. RN deputy Alberto Espina and UDI mayor of 
Las Condes Joaquin Lavin were third with around 40 percent each.

  [Text] Prosecutor General de Greiff faces a difficult 
situation after a group of U.S. congressmen rejected his 
participation as a speaker at a World Bank conference. 
Interestingly enough, several congressmen changed their minds 
following an intense diplomatic effort by de Greiff. 
  Despite his temper and nature, lately de Greiff has been 
tapping his diplomatic skills. First, he used his new talent on 
U.S. Senator John Kerry, who had criticized him harshly. De 
Greiff's telephone conversations with Kerry 15 days ago had such 
an effect that Kerry is considering coming to Colombia at de 
Greiff's invitation for a closer examination of the fight 
against the drug cartels. However, de Greiff went even further. 
De Greiff began contacts with U.S. judicial authorities, 
including U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, whose reaction to de 
Greiff's endeavor is not yet known. 
  The "Seven O'Clock Newscast" learned de Greiff has claimed 
that his views regarding drug legalization are purely academic 
and do not jeopardize the Colombian Government's policies. 
However, the Prosecutor General's Office and the government 
expect, as proof of its good relations with the U.S. Government, 
the prompt dispatch of evidence linking confessed 
drug-trafficker Ivan Urdinola with a case being currently 
reviewed in a Florida court implicating him with the trafficking 
of heroin in the United States. Twelve persons have been 
detained in Colombia and the United States in connection with 
this case.

  [Text] The Administrative Department of Security [DAS] 
today rejected Amnesty International charges that this security 
organization has lists of Patriotic Union [UP] members to be 
eliminated by DAS agents. The DAS director was taken off guard 
by three letters from Amnesty International representatives in 
France, Great Britain, and Switzerland. The letters, which 
arrived simultaneously, accused the DAS of planning a number of 
selective murders of UP members and of eliminating and murdering 
people who have been detained. DAS Director Fernando Britto Ruiz 
categorically denied this is an institutional policy and added 
that there is not the slightest chance it could occur. Britto 
announced that he will sue Amnesty International for making 
baseless accusations against the DAS. 
  [Begin Britto recording] I don't think an organization of 
this kind should make baseless accusations. They are obligated 
to justify their charges and must be held accountable for them. 
[end recording] 
  Britto said the UP members who Amnesty International said 
were going to be murdered by the DAS are actually under DAS 
protection and are in good health.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Charges of Media Bias </H5>
  Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana's 
campaign director Luis Alberto Moreno has lodged a protest with 
the National Television Council against the Inravision (National 
Institute of Radio and Television) network because of its 
decision not to broadcast an interview with Pastrana on the 
television program "Very Personal." Inravision rebutted Moreno's 
charge, arguing that candidates may only appear on opinion 
programs. Moreno responded by pointing out that an interview 
with Ernesto Samper had recently been aired during the "Very 
Personal" program. He reportedly also complained that Inravision 
had twice returned tapes of Pastrana's television commercials 
citing technical deficiencies, but later authorized the airing 
of those same tapes. (EL TIEMPO, 7 May) 
  In his 8 May commentary discussing the Samper campaign, EL 
TIEMPO columnist Enrique Santos Calderon referred to the 
Pastrana campaign's charges, saying the reported actions by 
Inravision represent "decisions which could indicate partiality 
on the part of that official institute, and which do not help 
the image of Ernesto Samper who doesn't need assistance of this 
kind." Referring to reporting by another network, Santos 
Calderon commented: "Nor is it in the best interest of the 
Liberal Party ticket for news programs, such as that of Caracol 
[network], to show such favoritism towards Samper. The 
appearance of being discriminated against or being `persecuted' 
by that network could generate sympathy for Pastrana." 
<H5>  Antioquia Tour </H5>
  Andres Pastrana conducted an intensive campaign tour in 
Antioquia Department which included some 40 municipalities, 
according to EL ESPECTADOR (23 April). Pastrana criticized his 
main rival, Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper, 
who he said had promised to obtain funding to complete the 
Medellin metro system and then failed to fulfill that pledge. 
According to Pastrana, Samper had made the statement during a 
visit to Medellin months earlier while still serving as 
Ambassador to Spain. 
  While in Antioquia, Pastrana met with nearly 600 Medellin 
militia members encamped at Media Luna. He was accompanied by 
Monsignor Hector Fabio Henao who has participated in the 
demobilization talks with militia members. (EL TIEMPO 25 April) 
<H5>  Nohra Pastrana Addressess Conference </H5>
  Nohra Pastrana, who accompanied her husband on his tour of 
Antioquia, addressed the Latin American Congress for the Family 
in the 21st Century, stressing the role of the family in 
building a peaceful society and ending corruption: 
  "Of what use is modernization, the opening of markets, the 
integration the world seeks, and science and technology, if we 
have a society without values. Only with values acquired through 
a good upbringing can we make use of the innovations in order to 
give dignity to the individual and the community and not destroy 
it. A bad family produces a bad citizen." 
  Mrs. Pastrana added that her husband had promoted policies 
that favored the family--a theme he continues to stress in the 
current campaign--while serving as mayor of Bogota, and that he 
has shown himself to be a person who kept his campaign promises. 
(EL ESPECTADOR, 23 April) 
<H5>  Focus on Youth </H5>
  Pastrana's campaign tours continue to include numerous 
visits 
to university campuses. On a recent tour of Valle del Cauca, for 
example, Pastrana visited at least four universities. In 
Pastrana's words, he has found "extraordinary receptivity" among 
the country's youth. (EL ESPECTADOR, 23 April) However, in one 
negative incident, a student threw a container of garbage at 
Pastrana as he responded to questions at the University del 
Valle on 28 April. Pastrana was quickly surrounded by 
bodyguards, and the audience applauded when a student announced 
over the microphone that this attack did not reflect the 
attitude of the majority of the university's students. (EL 
TIEMPO, 29 April) 
  Ernesto Samper has also spoken at a number of university 
campuses in recent weeks, often accompanied by his running mate 
Humberto De la Calle. 
<H5>  Tour of Several Departments </H5>
  Pastrana visited several municipalities of Cundinamarca on 
29-30 April where he discussed his social policy and proposed 
establishing a special type of insurance for temporarily 
unemployed persons who are unable to pay rent. Pastrana then 
traveled to Arauca Department and Bucaramanga, Santander 
Department. (EL TIEMPO, 3 May) On 4 May, following campaign 
appearances in Bogota, Pastrana toured several municipalities of 
Boyaca Department. 
<H5>  Visits to North Coast, San Andres Island </H5>
  Pastrana campaigned in Barranquilla in early May where he 
declared "the North Coast will give us the victory, because we 
are working for this region." Pastrana discussed his economic 
program with ranchers and representatives of business 
associations, and noted that, due to the prevailing 
circumstances in the North Coast departments, the region 
requires the adoption of a "veritable shock program" which, with 
cooperation between the private and public sectors, will allow a 
"reorientation of the productive sector" that will favor 
economic growth. (EL TIEMPO, 9 May) As a means of helping the 
agricultural sector, Pastrana said, more highways were needed to 
better integrate the North Coast departments with the rest of 
the country. He declared that this would be a better use of 
federal funds than the construction of a metro in Bogota 
proposed by Ernesto Samper. While in Barranquilla, Pastrana met 
with leaders of all the municipalities in Atlantico Department. 
He also spoke to students at the Universidad Autonoma del Caribe 
and the Universidad del Norte. (EL TIEMPO, 6, 7 May) 
  After spending three days in Barranqilla, Pastrana visited 
San Andres Island, where he discussed plans to promote tourism 
as a means of generating employment, describing tourism as one 
of the best potential sources of income for the country, 
according to EL ESPECTADOR (9 May). 
<H5>  Counternarcotics Policy </H5>
  In an 8 May interview published in EL ESPECTADOR Andres 
Pastrana stated: 
  "While it is necessary to have policies to prevent drug 
addiction and promote crop substitution, and to strengthen these 
policies, the state must stand firm in its policy of 
energetically repressing the trafficking and distribution of 
various drugs." 
  Pastrana pledged that, if elected, he would "redouble" 
efforts to make the Prosecutor General's Office "more 
effective," so that it would function as a "complement" to 
agencies engaged in the counternarcotics struggle.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Bogota Metro Proposal </H5>
  Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper, 
accompanied by a group of reporters, rode a stretch of the 
Bogota intercity train on 22 April as a means of promoting his 
proposal to build a metro system in Bogota. Under Samper's 
proposal, the metro system would use a large number of the 
existing railroad corridors. Samper emphasized that a mass 
transit system would do much to improve the quality of life for 
Bogota residents, noting that his train ride took only 25 
minutes, while by bus the same trip would have taken an hour and 
a half. According to his calculations, the metro would begin by 
providing 240 million rides per year, reaching the target of 600 
million rides annually in less than four years. (EL TIEMPO, 23 
April) After his train ride, Samper proceeded to a mass 
transportation conference organized by his campaign, with mass 
transit officials from other Latin American countries and a 
representative from the United Nations. Addressing the seminar, 
Samper described previous initiatives to build a metro system as 
a "long and sad history of wasted time and effort," and laid the 
blame for these failures on former city officials, including 
rival Conservative Party candidate and former mayor of Bogota, 
Andres Pastrana. After the seminar, Samper held a press 
conference to discuss further details of his metro proposal. (EL 
ESPECTADOR, 23 April) 
<H5>  Campaign "In Deficit" </H5>
  Speaking to reporters during the train ride across Bogota, 
Samper commented on recent testimony by convicted Colombian drug 
trafficker Gabriel Taboada before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. 
Taboada had alleged that trafficker influence is widespread in 
Colombia and that certain presidential candidates, whom he did 
not name, had used narcotics trafficking proceeds to help fund 
their campaigns. Samper reportedly said that, if need be, 
President Gaviria himself should go to the United States to 
defend Colombia's reputation. Samper declared that he had been 
very careful about receiving contributions from sources whose 
origin was not clear, noting that his campaign is "in deficit" 
precisely because it has been "scrupulous about monitoring the 
transparency" of contributions. (EL ESPECTADOR, 23 April) 
<H5>  Economic Program </H5>
  In an interview with EL ESPECTADOR (1 May), Samper said his 
proposed economic program of "social capitalism" acknowledges 
the "virtues of private initiative and the operation of 
markets," while recognizing their "limitations." It gives the 
state a "more definitive" role in the "regulation and 
orientation" of measures affecting the economy and social 
welfare. 
  According to Samper: 
  "The state must promote the democratization of credit and 
access to property; limit the concentration [of power] within 
the economy, and abuse by those with a dominant position in the 
market; and make a deliberate effort to promote competition." 
  Samper's model holds that economic policy should be guided 
by 
considerations of "efficiency" as much as of "equity," and that 
social policy has "as much importance" as economic policy. For 
this reason, says Samper, he has focused on job creation, for 
only in this way is it possible to "harmonize growth with a 
favorable distribution of income," and to improve the situation 
of the "46 percent of Colombian families who live in poverty." 
  Samper said his model does not view privatization as an 
"ideology," but seeks to use private capital to provide broader 
access to public services and to improve their quality and 
efficiency. He further explained that his model would recognize 
the need for intervention to influence the exchange rate, and 
for policies to protect producers from unfair competition, and 
to protect and subsidize agriculture. 
  As on past occasions, Samper contrasted his model of "social 
capitalism" with Pastrana's model of "savage capitalism." Samper 
faulted Pastrana's economic program, which he said would limit 
state action to providing only the "most basic" services--those 
related to defense, security, justice--and added that Pastrana 
advocated a "neutral" economic policy guided only by "efficiency 
without taking equity into account." According to Samper, 
Pastrana's social policy is essentially that of "picking up the 
victims" of the "concentration of economic power" and the 
"uncontrolled operation of the market." Pastrana, he said, 
"believes blindly in savage privatization without conditions" 
and is "concerned with economic figures and not with the 
individual." In addition, he said that Pastrana's job creation 
program is virtually "nonexistent." 
<H5>  Counternarcotics Policy </H5>
  In the same interview with EL ESPECTADOR (1 May) Samper said 
the country "cannot surrender a single millimeter to criminal 
organizations." Samper stated: 
  "In this internal struggle we will continue the policy of 
surrendering to justice which has served to dismantle some of 
the criminal organizations, but there is no doubt that more 
severe sentences must be imposed and the accumulation of 
sentence reductions must be prevented." 
  Samper spoke forcefully on the role of the international 
community in the counternarcotics effort: 
  "We must do much more to demand responsibility on the part 
of 
the international community in this struggle, especially in the 
control of money laundering, the sale of chemical substances, 
and the control of consumption in which the developed countries 
do not make a greater effort. I will develop an aggressive 
international policy in this regard so that the world finally 
understands that Colombia is the main victim and not the 
executioner." 
<H5>  Agriculture Sector Concerns </H5>
  During campaign tours of several municipalities in Huila and 
Tolima Departments affected by the agricultural crisis, Samper's 
promises to reinvigorate that sector met with enthusiastic 
applause, according to EL ESPECTADOR (25 April). Acknowledging 
that the agricultural sector has been negatively affected by the 
"apertura" (market opening) program, Samper said apertura must 
not be a one-way street whereby imports are favored at the 
expense of domestic producers. Samper proposed transforming the 
Agricultural Credit Bank (Caja Agraria) into "the tool of 
assistance of many years ago," so that it would be more 
responsive to the needs of farmers. (EL ESPECTADOR, 25 April) 
Samper added that his government would ensure that farmers and 
ranchers who wish to refinance their credit be allowed to do so. 
  Speaking to ranchers days later during a campaign visit to 
the Atlantic Coast region, Samper reiterated his promise to 
provide subsidies for agriculture and to address the problem of 
insurgent violence in the countryside. (EL TIEMPO 2 May) 
<H5>  "New Conservatism" Backs Samper </H5>
  A group calling itself "New Conservatism" announced its 
formation on 26 April in an event held in Bogota and attended by 
Ernesto Samper. (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 April) The group includes 
former presidential candidate Rodrigo Marin Bernal, Juvenal de 
los Rios, Rodolfo Segovia, and other Conservatives who have said 
they will support the Liberal Party candidate and his Alliance 
for Colombia. 
  Samper, who attended the event along with Humberto De la 
Calle, hailed the support of these "important Conservatives" as 
a "step forward in the direction of reforming Colombia 
politics," noting that change was needed because Colombians had 
"lost confidence in the mechanisms of representation and in 
public administration itself." (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 April) 
  The National Conservative Directorate issued a statement in 
which it criticized the group's decision to support Samper, and 
said the move demonstrates that Samper continues the practice of 
"clientelism which has corrupted the country's political 
customs." (EL ESPECTADOR, 26 April) 
<H5>  Ministry of Culture Planned </H5>
  On 29 April, during a campaign tour of several Atlantic 
Coast 
cities, Ernesto Samper attended the Cultural Forum in 
Barranquilla where he announced plans to establish a Ministry of 
Culture if elected. The forum, which took place at the 
nationally recognized Fine Arts School of the Universidad del 
Atlantico, was organized by a committee headed by Samper's wife, 
Jacquin, and attended by 700 Colombian artists. Samper said this 
proposed ministry could likewise be called the "Ministry of 
Peace since culture is synonymous with peace," and explained 
that such a ministry would strengthen the sense of national 
identity, fostering "unity within diversity." (EL TIEMPO, 30 
April) 
  EL TIEMPO'S coverage of the event included a half-page 
interview with Mrs. Samper in which she explained the rationale 
for establishing a separate Ministry of Culture and what its 
scope would be. (EL TIEMPO, 30 April) 
<H5>  Samper Opposes Reducing Beer Tax </H5>
  On 27 April Ernesto Samper asked Liberal Party senators not 
to support a bill currently under review by a Senate committee 
which would reduce the tax on beer, according to EL TIEMPO (28 
April). Samper explained that the beer tax accounts for over 25 
percent of the tax income received by the departments. In 13 
departments it accounts for more than half of tax income, and in 
four departments it accounts for 65 percent of tax income. 
Samper said he felt he was in a position to make such a request 
because he is leader of the party, and noted that he had reached 
a judgment on the bill as a result of his discussions with 
Liberal governors. Samper also proposed that trade officials 
study ways to alleviate the fiscal burden on the beer industry 
to reduce the problem of contraband.

<F P=106> [Responses to an EL TIEMPO questionnaire on economic-related </F>
campaign issues by Colombian presidential candidates Ernesto 
Samper Pizano of the Liberal Party and Andres Pastrana of the 
Conservative Party] 
  [Excerpts] [EL TIEMPO] What will be your economic policies? 
What dangers and opportunities is Colombia currently facing, and 
how will you handle these issues? 
  [Samper] My government's economic policies will attempt to 
consolidate economic opening and to channel benefits from 
economic development to all of Colombia and its people through a 
program designed to step up economic growth, create 1.5 million 
new useful jobs, and implement ambitious and modern social 
policies. 
  Colombia's greatest opportunity is to invest intelligently 
and carefully in tapping new oil fields, such as Cusiana, to 
vigorously promote the socio-economic development of the country 
and all of its regions. As for the greatest danger facing 
Colombia, it is undoubtedly the revaluation of the peso, which 
could harm exports, agriculture, the industrial sector, and 
other production activities. 
  We need to implement the following plans: a macroeconomic 
policy geared toward preventing peso revaluations and keeping 
low interest rates to reduce inflation; a Strategic Exporting 
Plan to double secondary exports within four years; a 
Countryside Recovery Plan to enable peasants to regain their 
jobs and income; an Industrial Modernization Plan to spark 
growth of more than 7.5 percent annually and to make industries 
more competitive; an ambitious program to support mini- and 
mid-sized enterprises to take advantage of their job-creating 
potential; priority programs to invest in people, education, 
health, housing, infrastructure, and technological development; 
and a special training and job-placement program for those 
groups that encounter more difficulties when hunting for jobs 
(youths, female heads of household, unemployed elderly people, 
and handicapped people). 
  [Pastrana] The economic policies I will implement during my 
administration will focus on broadening, improving, and 
streamlining the structural reforms that make the economy more 
efficient and more competitive internationally. They also will 
set standards for the economy to grow at a sustainable 8-percent 
annual rate, will create well-paying jobs for a highly skilled 
labor, will promote adequate protection of the environment, and 
will advocate an increased standard of living for the poorest 
people. 
  The nation's best opportunity stems from the exchange of 
products, services, and ideas that the world community has to 
offer and that will allow Colombia to make a great leap forward 
in its socioeconomic development process. Moreover, oil 
resources must let us reinforce this process by implementing an 
investment program in the areas of infrastructure, education, 
health, science, and technology. 
  The greatest danger facing the nation revolves around 
yielding to the temptation of closing the economy by 
establishing barriers that will encourage inefficiency and hold 
the country back. 
  The best way to take advantage of these opportunities and to 
avoid these dangers is to reward the efforts of companies and 
workers in order to improve their production by aligning their 
efforts by way of educational programs, which are the only 
mechanisms that will make these efforts viable, and to offer 
assistance to those who cannot take full advantage of the 
nation's new opportunities because of structural or 
institutional hurdles. [passage omitted] 
  The tools I will use are: 
  A. A strategic commercial policy that will combine economic 
opening with an export policy that supports technology, 
marketing, the financing of successful projects, and 
negotiations with foreign governments; legal and economic 
support in international conflicts; and finally, strict and firm 
action in matters such as unfair competition and barriers to 
competition. 
  B. A reform of the educational system and science and 
technology to convert education and knowledge into a factor of 
production. 
  C. A public investment program with fiscal discipline and 
the 
modernization of the public sector. 
  D. The promotion of private savings and investment through 
reforms to the financial system and the stock market, as well as 
support for new forms of institutional savings. 
  E. Legal reforms to eliminate obstacles for the 
participation 
of the private sector in the financing, implementation, and 
administration of public works and services. 
  F. The presentation of bills that will prevent and correct 
the already mentioned barriers to competition. 
  G. The reorganization of the regional decentralization 
process to guarantee autonomy accompanied by responsibility. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What can Colombians expect in terms of those 
areas the next government will highlight in its budget? 
  [Samper] In my government, public investment will be devoted 
to human capital (in areas such as health, education, and 
low-income housing), infrastructure (roads, energy supply, 
telecommunications, and land improvement), and technological 
development. 
  [Pastrana] Education, potable water, infrastructure (roads, 
energy, communications, irrigation districts), health, research, 
and training and technical assistance in rural areas will be my 
priorities in terms of public investment. [passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] What will happen to economic opening? Will you 
modify it? How will you handle the concentration of wealth 
caused by it? 
  [Samper] 1. Our intention is to consolidate opening with the 
aim to increase exports and to create jobs so that the people 
will benefit from it. We will implement the second phase of the 
opening--the social phase. I will establish the principle of 
"reciprocity" in international trade negotiations. 
  2. We must confuse "integration" with "concentration." The 
country is interested in having strong, integrated enterprises, 
but only as long as they do not use their strength to form 
monopolies. To fight such practices, I will first use 
international competition that results from the opening. Second, 
I will resort to legal and administrative measures, such as the 
ones I created when I was in the Development Ministry. When 
public assets are privatized, the proceeds must go to the 
general public in order not to concentrate them in a few hands. 
  [Pastrana] 1. I will maintain economic opening by placing 
more emphasis on the microeconomic aspects of the reforms, 
strengthening mechanisms against unfair competition, improving 
customs, helping enterprises to run smoothly, and helping 
producers who are facing structural impediments to enable them 
to respond to increased competition. 
  2. The opening only leads to the concentration of wealth 
when 
it is not accompanied by measures that will engender real 
opportunities in all regions, enterprises, and workers. For this 
reason, we must immediately strengthen economic opening with 
investments in infrastructure, education, technical assistance 
for producers, adequate information systems, and stabilization 
funds for the rural sector. In addition, all of this must be 
done within the law, under a true regional decentralization, and 
in a responsible way in an effort to discourage any 
anticompetitive behavior. [passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] Will the minimum wage prove to be adequate? Your 
decision will affect the lives of the Colombian people; how will 
the wage increase be calculated? 
  [Samper] I will urge businessmen and workers to sign a 
Social 
Pact that will allow us to generate more and better jobs, 
increase productivity, and heighten purchasing power. The pact 
will seek to make all salaries rise in real terms in proportion 
with the increases in productivity while keeping inflationary 
pressures and the peso revaluation under control. 
  [Pastrana] A decision on a minimum wage will have to take 
the 
following into consideration: 
  A. The independence of all other price structures in the 
economy. 
  B. Labor market conditions. 
  C. Better measures to constantly improve the income of less 
qualified workers. 
  D. On-the-job productivity. 
  E. An agreement among workers, employers, and the 
government. 
In this agreement, each party will assume its share of 
responsibility to reduce inflation, maintain macroeconomic 
stability, and promote greater competition of national products. 
[passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] Services, gasoline, and transportation. The 
state 
is in charge of setting price and fare adjustments. How will you 
do this in the next administration? 
  [Samper] The prices and fares controlled by the state permit 
the expansion and improvement of the financial underpinnings of 
public service enterprises, but only as long as these 
enterprises are run efficiently. 
  If they are run efficiently, then the government can adjust 
fares in accordance with price and salary adjustments, thereby 
allowing the state to stop giving a "bad example" in the social 
adjustment of the economy. [passage omitted] 
  [Pastrana] The country is increasingly closer to giving up 
its control over charges for public services and markedly 
reducing the gasoline subsidy. This does not necessarily mean 
that there will be a sustained increase in the prices of either. 
I intend to move quickly in this direction. In terms of public 
services, a strict state regulation of enterprises, when 
combined as much possible with greater competition, will 
guarantee that these enterprises will not transfer the cost of 
their inefficiency or their financial mismanagement to the 
public. In the case of gasoline, the outlook for national and 
international petroleum allows us to think of the feasibility of 
a four-year plan to free the oil market. ECOPETROL [Colombian 
Petroleum Enterprises] can use its refining capacity to 
stabilize internal oil prices. This process will be accompanied 
by the liberation of transportation fares within a strict 
framework of state regulation to guarantee quality, coverage, 
and safety to passengers. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How will the Cusiana oil fields affect us? We 
are 
at the beginning of an oil bonanza. How will we manage these 
resources and distribute the benefits? 
  [Samper] We will create a Fund for Oil Stabilization that 
will keep part of these resources overseas during the years of 
maximum production to allow us to maintain high investment 
levels a few years later when production in these oil fields has 
begun to decline. 
  We will draft mid-term investment plans that include both 
the 
national government and the regions to ensure that the resources 
are invested in the country's top priorities: education, health, 
low-income housing, improvement of infrastructure, and 
technological development. 
  We will back institutional and technical development in 
departments and municipalities to efficiently invest the large 
revenues they are entitled to--revenues that will come from 
royalties, allocations from the National Royalty Fund, and their 
share of the nation's current earnings. [passage omitted] 
  [Pastrana] The Cusiana oil fields provide a great 
opportunity 
for the country and its regions to consolidate a process of 
high, sustainable, and equitable growth in favor of the poorest 
sectors of the population. For this purpose, I agree with the 
experts who have proposed the creation of an overseas savings 
fund. I will channel the country's revenues to improving the 
quality and coverage of education, bringing potable water to all 
Colombians, and overcoming the existing inefficiencies in the 
infrastructure and technological development. I will reorganize 
decentralization to guarantee that the regions will have fiscal 
autonomy with political responsibility and economic efficiency. 
I will guarantee that the government will contribute to 
macroeconomic stability with greater efficiency in spending and 
in tax collection. I will create conditions that enable the 
private sector to contribute to stable growth by increasing its 
rate of savings. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The agricultural crisis in Colombia. This has 
been the most overlooked sector in the current administration; 
how will it be treated by your administration? 
  [Samper] My administration will work to implement increased 
land improvement; the creation and strengthening of 
Stabilization Funds; insurance for crops to decrease price 
fluctuations and other risks; technology; subsidies for 
capitalization; support for those affected by unfair 
competition; the strengthening of the Agrarian Fund, the DRI 
[Integrated Rural Development Program], and the PNR [National 
Rehabilitation Plan]; and a policy to recover tranquility in the 
rural areas. This policy will include the modernization of the 
Armed Forces, social investment, and the creation of jobs. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Pastrana] I will reinforce measures to reactivate the 
sector. I will guarantee a sustainable and efficient 
agricultural system that will be integrated with industrial 
processes that will offer stable and well-paying jobs. It will 
be an agricultural system supported by modern services from a 
business standpoint. It will be a system with investment in 
infrastructure, development, transfer of technology, 
capitalization, price and market information, marketing, 
institutional strength, and a strong rural economy. It will 
overcome the negative effects of problems such as drug 
trafficking, illegal crops, and violence. [passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] The future of coffee growers. Will you subsidize 
domestic coffee prices or will you go with international prices? 
  [Pastrana] As a matter of fact, the international price must 
be the primary long-term reference point for the domestic coffee 
price. In unfavorable conditions and for short periods, the 
National Coffee Fund could receive government support in the 
form of credits to prevent fluctuations or abrupt drops in the 
income of coffee producers. As a general rule, any subsidy must 
be studied in terms of its social cost and the most effective 
and honest way to manage the subsidy. However, I believe better 
results are obtained if producers are directly supported with 
technology, marketing, access to credit, and so on, instead of 
with subsidies. 
  [Samper] I have vowed to free coffee production from 
macroeconomic control. I will channel budgetary resources to 
finance infrastructure and social investment projects. These 
were projects that used to be financed with resources from 
coffee growers. I will support the efforts that the Coffee 
Federation is making. I will promote a more aggressive and 
deregulated marketing policy. The National Coffee Fund will be 
used only to stabilize prices and coffee growers' income. 
[passage omitted] 
  [EL TIEMPO] Low-income housing. How will your administration 
treat purchasing power? What will be the role of the Savings and 
Mortgage Associations? 
  [Samper] The Savings and Mortgage Associations 
[Corporaciones 
de Ahorro y Vivienda, CAV's] will play a key role in financing 
the construction sector. We will implement an aggressive housing 
policy with an investment of $1 billion over four years to 
deliver 500,000 low-income houses to resolve this grave problem 
for 500,000 Colombian families. This policy will support the 
organizations that work in the area of low-income housing. The 
CAV's will have the same rights and obligations that other 
financial intermediaries have. [passage omitted] 
  [Pastrana] The UPAC [Constant Value Savings Certificate] 
system has proven to be the best mechanism to convert cash 
savings into long-term loans for construction, and its 
importance to the country's development has been truly 
invaluable. The consolidation of the system, the changes in the 
construction sector, and most of all, the new framework for the 
financial system in Colombia have resulted, on the one hand, in 
a diversification in employing CAV resources and, on the other 
hand, in new savings alternatives for investors. Therefore, they 
offer possibilities that are different from those offered by 
savings accounts in other institutions. 
  To handle this situation, changes become necessary within 
the 
following parameters: 
  1. They must respond to permanent, not circumstantial, 
transformations in the economy. 
  2. They must be made to preserve the strength of the 
system--a system based on stability, on the recovery of its 
portfolio, and on its profitability. 
  3. They must maintain the basic identity of the system as a 
source of long-term resources to finance housing for medium- and 
low-income sectors of the population. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement issued on behalf of the Colombian Constitutional </F>
Court by Court President Jorge Arango Mejia in Santa Fe de 
Bogota on 18 May] 
  [Text] Statement from the president of the Constitutional 
Court, as spokesman for the Court: 
  1. As a lawyer and a judge, I refuse to issue in haste an 
opinion on the varied and complex judicial issues raised by the 
president of the Republic in his 18 May (17 May) statements. It 
is necessary to study them thoroughly. 
  In addition, as president of the Constitutional Court, I am 
forbidden from engaging in controversies surrounding the Court's 
decisions, regardless of whether a citizen or the chief of the 
Executive Branch himself starts them. 
  2. The Constitutional Court's decisions, arrived at through 
a 
majority vote, are the decisions of the institution, not just 
the decisions of those who voted in favor of a decision, because 
neither the Constitution nor the law requires unanimity. This is 
why the attempt to create divisions and dissension over the 
Court's vote is inadmissible. There is only one Constitutional 
Court. 
  3. The Constitution stipulates the separation of government 
branches. Thus anything that entails interference by one branch 
in the inherent functions of another contravenes the 
Constitution itself. We will have to determine to what extent 
the president of the Republic's disapproval of the 
Constitutional Court's decision respects the Court's autonomy, 
complies with the constitutional mandate established for 
harmonious collaboration among government branches, and 
contributes to institutions' normal procedures. 
  4. The Constitutional Court has ruled and will continue to 
rule with resolute autonomy, thereby fulfilling its duty to 
safeguard the integrity and preponderance of the Constitution as 
stipulated in Article 214. The Court must always remain detached 
from pressure and flattery, regardless of who exerts the former 
and who utters the latter. 
  Finally, the public must understand that when the 
Constitutional Court issues a decision, it does so to meet its 
exclusive commitments without the need for or opportunity to 
consult anyone or anything other than the Constitution. 
  [Dated] Santa Fe de Bogota. 18 May 1994 
  [Signed] Jorge Arango Mejia.

  [Text] The four magistrates who dissented with the ruling 
that decriminalizes consumption of personal doses of drugs in 
Colombia characterize it as "fatal," "anachronistic," and 
"unconstitutional." 
  The magistrates seriously question the premise that taking 
drugs is part of the right to free development of personality. 
  The four Constitutional Court magistrates who dissented with 
the ruling which decriminalizes the possession and consumption 
of personal doses of drugs characterize as "fatal" the majority 
decision by the court and warn that this is an attack on the 
thousands of victims of Colombia's struggle against drugs. 
  Under the premise that the right to freely develop one's 
personality is all-encompassing, the magistrates warn that it 
could follow that other conduct apparently related to the 
individual person could be construed as legal, for example in 
the case of abortions. 
  "Those of us in dissent emphatically reject this notion. As 
with other opinions, we express our confusion in light of the 
enormous contradiction that has been established by this 
decision," they note. 
  The dissenting magistrates make it clear that the decision 
by 
the five magistrates who support decriminalizing the use of 
drugs was adopted in the total exercise of clearly established 
constitutional powers. 
  The magistrates note, furthermore, that decriminalizing the 
use of drugs in the name of the right to free development of 
personality violates rights to health, coexistence of citizens, 
and family integrity; the principle of solidarity; the 
prevailing general interest; and the obligation to respect the 
rights of others and not abuse one's own. 
  In the magistrates' opinion, abandoning the drug addict "to 
the apparent exercise of his free will does nothing but 
subjugate him to the will of those who manipulate and control 
the infamous drug market. They will be pleased to see how their 
victims are authorized to continue depending on their lethal 
market. [no closing quotation mark as published] 
  It was on these terms that Magistrates Hernando Herrera, 
Vladimiro Naranjo, Jose Hernandez, and Fabio Moron formally 
distanced themselves yesterday from the Constitutional Court's 
decision permitting the decriminalization of the use of personal 
doses of drugs. 
  In their dissenting opinion, the four jurists claim that the 
court's decision reflects a paradox and an ambiguity which are 
very difficult to understand. 
  On the one hand, they say, it authorizes personal doses, but 
on the other it continues the penalization of narcotics. That 
is, it allows individuals to take drugs but prohibits the 
production, distribution, and sale of these same drugs. 
  In their opinion, it is totally illogical that the law 
protects the consumer from a product while punishing he who 
supplies that product. "How can this dilemma be resolved?" the 
magistrates ask. 
  "Perhaps by decriminalizing the production, distribution, 
and 
sale of drugs? That is, by legalizing all narcotrafficking 
activities and thus overnight turning the sinister mafia into 
`honorable merchants and exporters'?" 
  National and international opinion would unanimously 
repudiate--and rightfully so--such a preposterous solution that 
would imply, no more and no less, that with the stroke of a pen 
the worst criminals our history has ever known--those 
responsible for the deaths and kidnappings of thousands and 
thousands of people, assassinations of important people, and the 
systematic collective poisoning of youths--would become innocent 
victims of the weight of the law. 
  According to Herrera, Naranjo, Moron, and Hernandez, the 
motive behind the court's decision must be described as 
"ingenuous" and "anachronistic," because it only reflects the 
19th Century concept of individual liberalism, totally 
disregarding the ideological, political, and economic evolution 
experienced by contemporary liberalism. 
  As for the free development of personality, the four jurists 
firmly declare that this right has been interpreted incorrectly 
in this ruling that has decriminalized drug use. 
  "To interpret, as the majority has done, that this right 
implies the unlimited power of each person to do whatever he 
chooses with his life, even to irrational extremes--such as 
threatening his own physical or mental well-being--is a fatal 
mistake," they state. 
  Further, the jurists who rejected the ruling warn that 
liberty cannot be contrary to humankind, because the human being 
is an end in himself, "therefore, it is incorrect to affirm that 
on behalf of his liberty man should be degenerated, which would 
be equivalent to depersonalizing himself." 
  Herrera, Naranjo, Moron, and Hernandez warn at the same time 
that the decision which decriminalized personal drug doses has 
skimpy legal arguments and added that drug addiction is 
undoubtedly a blatant attack on mankind's dignity. 
  In their opinion, straying from the principle of human 
dignity undoubtedly leads to man's degradation. 
  According to the four magistrates, drug production is by 
every definition an existing crime--not a potential 
crime--against humankind. Tolerating consumption of the cause of 
an evil would mean legitimizing its noxious effects. 
  "In other words, it means legalizing that which is illegal," 
they emphasize. 
  In their opinion, liberty promoted through depraved means is 
conducive to libertinage and does not make man more noble, but 
rather deprives him of his dignity. 
  "Human dignity, therefore, requires that man act according 
to 
his conscience and freedom of choice, that is, led by his own 
convictions and not under pressure from a passion or inordinate 
desire, which deep down is actually coercion," they stated. 
  In explaining their vote, they note therefore that leaving a 
drug addict to his fate is equivalent to leaving him subject to 
the enslavement created by his dependence on drugs. The 
magistrates make it clear that taking drugs cannot be considered 
an indifferent act and warned that the rules that were declared 
unconstitutional--Articles 51 and 87 of Law 30 of 1986--have a 
sound basis in law and in the Constitution. 
  In the final part of their opinion, the four jurists say 
that 
permissiveness in the matter of personal drug doses has had 
harmful effects in Spain and in Great Britain--where the measure 
has been reconsidered--and in the Netherlands. 
  In Great Britain--they note--authorities adopted measures in 
the 1960's and 1970's so that addicts could receive heroin 
legally in drugstores; the result was a 100 percent increase in 
the number of addicts and a 300 percent increase in illegal drug 
trafficking. 
  Alaska enacted--they explain--a law which increased the 
personal doses of marijuana to four ounces (some 140 grams.) 
That resulted in marijuana use among children between 11 and 14 
growing to three times the U.S. national average. This law was 
revoked recently. 
  "It should be noted, also, that these cases were in 
countries 
that are not drug producers or exporters; this is not the case 
in Colombia, where high rates of consumption are added to the 
unfortunate fact that this country is one of the principal 
producers and exporters on a global scale, with all the ensuing 
implications," they state.

<F P=106> [Text of government communique issued in Santa Fe de Bogota </F>
on 18 May] 
  [Text] Aware of the reasons which led the Constitutional 
Court to declare unconstitutional provisions which penalize the 
possession and consumption of personal doses of drugs, the 
national government reasserts that it will obey the judicial 
decision. Not only does the government not agree with the 
decision, it believes that its effect will be serious. 
Consumption of substances that create addiction cannot be part 
of the behavior condoned as part of the free development of 
personality. Legislators must be given the option to ban and 
punish this, according to his criteria. 
  The government does not share the court's extremely 
individualistic interpretation of the Constitution in matters 
related not only to individual autonomy but also to obligations 
established in the Constitution, in this case Articles 49 and 95. 
  The government considers it its duty to promote the 
necessary 
decisions to fill the void and mistakes that might result from 
the court's decision. Immediately, using authority derived from 
laws now in effect, the government will issue decrees to 
prohibit and to confirm prohibitions on the possession and 
consumption of drugs and psychotropic and hallucinatory 
substances in at least the following places and events: public 
places, places open to the public, schools, and workplaces. 
Drugs will be banned among minors, pregnant women; drivers of 
vehicles, ships, or airplanes; those who bear firearms; and 
those who exercise certain professions, such as doctors and 
dentists. 
  Likewise, we intend to establish penalties for violations of 
some of the preceding prohibitions, according to each case and 
the seriousness of the misdemeanor. The penalties will range 
from arrest, closure of public places, suspension of flight 
licenses, cancellation of work contracts, suspension or firing 
of public workers, deportation of foreigners, cancellation of 
firearm permits, and the suspension of licenses or professional 
cards. 
  The government reiterates that topics of such importance 
must 
take into account what the people have to say, thus the 
government calls on all Colombian society--political parties, 
churches, economic associations, workers, peasants, social and 
community organizations, the academic community, parents and 
youths--to present together with the government a draft bill 
with popular initiative, to call a referendum to modify the 
Constitution to clearly establish the prevalence of the general 
interest, the possibility of penalizing citizens for not 
fulfilling their duties, and clearly stating the legislators' 
prerogative to ban and prohibit the consumption of drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  In the next few weeks the president will call on 
representatives of the various mentioned institutions and 
organizations to form promotional committees and begin the 
necessary formalities for a popular legislative initiative. 
Given the reaction in the last few days, the national government 
is certain that it is correctly interpreting the feelings of all 
Colombians in support of the fight against drug trafficking and 
preventing youths from Colombia and the rest of the world from 
falling into the claws of today's most damaging perversity--drug 
consumption.

  [Text] The effects of credit restrictions have begun to be 
felt in the financial system. The measures adopted more than a 
month ago are resulting in slower growth of the loan portfolios 
of credit institutions and an increase in interest rates for the 
loans. 
  While the portfolios (financial sector loans) had been 
growing by 3.3 percent between 12 March and 10 April 1993, the 
increase was 2.5 percent during the same period of this year. 
  According to EL TIEMPO's estimates the system would have 
loaned approximately 100 billion pesos more if credit were 
increasing at the same rate as last year. 
  The impact is expected to be greater in the coming weeks 
because, by means of the measures, the Central Bank's Board of 
Directors seeks to achieve a rate of growth in credit of only 
2.2 percent per month. 
  In addition, Decree 673, which was issued by the government 
and requires the financial system to increase its net assets 
[patrimonio], is expected to have a noticeable impact in May. 
<H5>  The Impact </H5>
  The growth in bank portfolios [between 12 March and 10 
April] 
decreased from 3.5 to 2.4 percent. However, the impact has been 
most evident in the portfolios of commercial financing 
companies. The growth rate dropped from 6.6 percent in April of 
last year to only 2.1 percent [for the period 12 March-10 April, 
1994]. 
  The president of the National Association of Financial 
Institutions (ANIF), Javier Fernandez, said the lower rate of 
increase could be attributed, in large part, to the drop in the 
volume of loans granted by the commercial financing companies 
for automobile purchases. 
  Despite the measures to restrict internal and external 
credit, the means of payment (money in circulation and current 
accounts) continue to grow at a rate of 40 percent, considerably 
above the target fixed by the Central Bank which is between 21 
and 28 percent. An excessive increase is detrimental for 
achieving the inflation goal. This explains monetary 
authorities' concern with controlling the increase in money in 
public circulation. 
<H5>  Interest Rates Increase </H5>
  Another consequence of the credit restrictions is the 
increase in the investment (colocacion) interest rates. 
  While loans were granted at an average interest rate of 
36.09 
percent in March 11 of this year (prior to the measures), by 15 
April the rate had increased to 38.08 percent. 
  The credit system had foreseen an increase of two or three 
points as a result of the measures. 
  The highest interest rates are found in the banks and 
commercial financing companies which charge, on average, 38 and 
39 percent, respectively. 
  The difference between what is being charged for loans and 
what savers are receiving averages 13 percent. 
  However, contrary to what was expected, interest rates for 
savers have not dropped noticeably. Prior to the measures, 
earnings of 25.60 percent were being received. Today earnings 
average 25.35 percent.

  [Text] A bomb exploded this evening in Medellin as a police 
patrol car passed by, coming from the stadium. Preliminary 
information received by AM/PM newscast indicates six agents were 
riding in the patrol car destroyed by the explosion. One officer 
and three policemen died, and two were critically injured. The 
patrol car was part of a police caravan in charge of the 
security for a soccer match in Colombia. This street was the 
only route the caravan could take to reach their command post. 
The policemen spent the whole game facing the crowd to guarantee 
the players' safety.

  [Text] Dr. Carlos Uribe, who successfully treated [soccer 
player] Pibe Valderrama's knee injury, operated on President 
Cesar Gaviria yesterday morning. 
  The Presidency Information and Press Secretariat reported 
Gaviria "is recovering from the surgery he underwent." 
  According to the medical report, "the surgery lasted one 
hour 
and 50 minutes, and it freed the posterior tibial nerve, which 
was restrained at the tarsus tunnel of his right foot. This is 
why the operation could be satisfactorily performed." 
  Presidency sources also reported the chief of state was 
hospitalized at 0630. One hour later, he was transferred to the 
operating room, where he underwent surgery until 0930. Gaviria 
remained unconscious until noon due to the anesthesia. 
  Dr. Uribe said the president remained under medical 
supervision all day yesterday.

  [Text] Prime Minister Nicolae Vacariou held a working 
luncheon with Chamber of Commerce entrepreneurs at the Guarani 
Hotel. He talked about the Romanian economic opening, adding 
that the country has chosen to liberalize its trade and prices, 
and to offer its industrial production abroad. 
  Vacariou said that following the consolidation of its 
democracy, Romania is currently experiencing political and 
macroeconomic stability which has allowed it to join the 
international community. "Our basic concern now is to maintain a 
low inflation rate and to continue to privatize state 
companies," Vacariou said. 
  The Romanian official said that during the past four years, 
more than 380,000 new companies were created with private 
capital, adding that 70,000 of them are foreign owned. Vacariou 
said the transfer of public companies to private hands requires 
a complex process that must be examined carefully in order to 
obtain positive results. 
  He stressed that Romanian industry is evolving positively, 
which permits it to sell its products abroad. Among the areas 
with the largest potential are the metallurgical industry and 
the manufacture of agricultural and oil exploration and 
exploitation machinery. "This permits Romanian businessmen to 
look for ways to cooperate with their Paraguayan partners," 
Vacariou said. The prime minister hopes both countries will 
consolidate stronger relations, not just in the commercial area, 
but also in the area of mutual cooperation. 
  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy decorated the Romanian prime 
minister with the National Order of Merit in the degree of Grand 
Special Cross at Government Palace. On the occasion, Wasmosy 
advocated strengthening relations between Romania and Paraguay 
through solid trade and mutual support.

  [Text] Lima, 20 May (EFE) -- Today, the Peruvian Government 
said President Alberto Fujimori refused to meet Amnesty 
International (AI) representatives because he believes it is 
"inadmissible" for them to request a change in the country's 
laws. 
  Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega said: "Lawyers from 
New York or AI cannot be allowed to request the change of the 
country's laws or judicial procedures." He added: "It now seems 
that Americas Watch also wants to come to Peru." 
  AI Secretary General Pierre Sane from Senegal has been in 
Peru since 14 May, heading a delegation that met with Lima 
Archbishop Augusto Vargas Alzamora and relatives of the missing 
and people detained in Lima and Ayacucho. Minister Vega said 
Sane requested the appointment of a commission composed of 
notables in order to effectively guarantee human rights. Vega 
said: "The foreigners' visit, who in two days are telling us how 
we should administer justice, cannot be tolerated. This is an 
excess that cannot be allowed." 
  Vega again rejected the request for changing Peruvian 
antiterrorist laws by saying the Repentance Law, which is blamed 
for the arrest of innocent people accused of terrorist 
activities that have not been adequately proven, should not be 
changed. Vega said: The law says the accusations must be 
clearly proven before any arrests are made. He added, however, 
that there are judges who do not implement the law correctly but 
there are certain corrective mechanisms in the judicial branch 
and the Prosecutor's Office for that purpose. 
  Pierre Sane will meet today with members of the Peruvian 
Congress Human Rights Committee to request changes in the 
Repentance Law. He also will insist on the formation of a 
commission of notables. Sane believes these requests do not 
interfere with Peruvian sovereignty. 
  Sane said AI has asked the U.S. Government for the formation 
of this type of commission, which he said already exists in 
other countries. Sane sent a letter to the Peruvian Government 
last April to announce his arrival on 15 May and requested a 
meeting with President Fujimori, the Armed Forces' chiefs, and 
police. 
  Vega answered that because of the prejudice and negative 
attitude shown by AI regarding respect for human rights in Peru, 
Sane will not be received.

  [Text] According to the latest poll done by the Imasen 
company, President Alberto Fujimori might be reelected because 
he can defeat his closest contender, Javier Perez de Cuellar, in 
the first and second electoral rounds. 
  According to Imasen, Fujimori could win the first round with 
39 percent of the votes, followed by Perez de Cuellar with 31.3 
percent, Ricardo Belmont with 12.5 percent, Fernando Belaunde 
with 1.8 percent, and Alfonso Barrantes with 1.6 percent. 
  Compared with the previous Imasen poll on the first round, 
Fujimori's percentage rose 3 points, while Perez de Cuellar's 
dropped 1.5 points and Belmont's rose 1.4 points. 
  The following question was posed to the people who were 
polled: "If the presidential elections were held tomorrow, and 
if Alberto Fujimori and Javier Perez de Cuellar were the only 
contenders, for whom would you vote?" This situation would be 
similar to a second electoral round. The voters' answer favored 
Alberto Fujimori by 46.6 percent, while 43.6 percent supported 
Perez de Cuellar. Imasen said "support for the ex-United 
Nations secretary general has dropped since our last poll (last 
month), when he obtained 45.7 percent and Fujimori 44.1 percent." 
  If second round contenders were Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont 
and the current president, the margin in favor of Fujimori would 
be larger, as he would obtain 54.1 percent while Belmont 
obtained 28.6 percent. According to Imasen, compared with the 
last poll the president improved his position from 51.6 to 54.1 
percent, while Belmont rose from 26.1 to 28.6 percent. 
  A hypothetical runoff between architect Fernando Belaunde 
and 
Fujimori showed a big difference: The former president obtained 
13.4 percent of the votes, while Fujimori obtained 63.8 percent.

  [Text] Yesterday, Oswaldo Sandoval (NM C-90) [New 
Majority-Change 90], CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] 
Foreign Relations Committee chairman, rejected any kind of 
deadline or pressure for approving the Lima Conventions signed 
between Chile and Peru. The conventions seek to iron out 
disagreements derived from the 1929 Treaty. The opposition, 
meanwhile, proposed canceling the implementation of the 
documents. These comments were made on the occasion of the 
first anniversary of the signing of the documents by the 
Peruvian and Chilean Governments. 
  The NM-C90 legislator said talks between the two countries' 
foreign ministries aimed at improving the text of the document 
have been suspended since the new government took over in Chile. 
"We (the committee) are waiting for the Foreign Ministry to 
inform us about any possible progress," Sandoval said. He 
recalled that the foreign minister told him about a month ago 
that talks had been suspended temporarily due to the change in 
government in Chile. 
  Sandoval said the only limitations that can be imposed on an 
issue of this nature are those represented by the level of 
consensus in the committee, in Congress, or in the population." 
[no opening quotation mark as published] 
  Congressman Julio Dias Palacios (MDI) [Democratic Left 
Movement], also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, 
noted he had presented a draft bill to have the diplomatic notes 
and decrees on the Lima Convention be declared without effect. 
"The government desire to solve the problems derived from the 
1929 Treaty must be done within a framework where national 
sovereignty comes first, and the agreements included in the 
Treaty are respected, as we have been demanding," Palacios 
argued. 
  The legislator said that in practice the process has been 
thwarted, as Chile does not accept the observations made in 
Peru. "Before we restart the process it would be preferable to 
have everything done in the past annulled, so that we can start 
negotiating conventions that are favorable to the country," 
Palacios said.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 19 May. 
  The State Petroleum Agency has hit a production record with 
the exploitation of well 148-D in the Vivian oilfield in the 
northern jungle. Its initial production totals 6,728 barrels per 
day. The exploitation of wells 148-D and 147-D produces 35,118 
barrels per day, the highest in the past 10 years. (Lima EXPRESO 
in Spanish 7 May 94 p A22) 
  The National Mining Association, SNM, reported that mining 
exports dropped 13 percent in 1993. Lead production, however, 
rose 12 percent; zinc 10.26 percent; silver 2.7 percent; and 
iron 84 percent, when compared with 1992. Gold production 
increased 36 percent with the exploitation of the Yanacocha 
mine. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 9 May 94 Economic Section p 
B11) 
  The SNM reported that the mining industry accounted for 36 
percent of foreign investments in 1993. The National Commission 
for Foreign Investment and Technology reported that foreign 
capital totalled $1.608 billion through February 1994. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 9 May 94 Economic Section p B11) 
  On 10 May, Ricardo Marcenaro Frers, Democratic Constituent 
Congress Labor Committee coordinator, reported that 77.4 percent 
of the economically active population was underemployed in 1993; 
and unemployment and employment rates were 9.9 percent and 12.7 
percent respectively. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 11 May 94 p 
A4) 
  On 11 March, the international financing community decided 
to 
grant a $1.1 billion loan to Peru during the 1994-95 fiscal year 
running from July 1994 to June 1995. In face of the good results 
obtained by the Peruvian Government's economic program, 
approximately 20 countries and financial institutions agreed to 
help Peru during the meeting of the Peruvian Consultative Group 
sponsored by the World Bank in Paris. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in

  [Text] At a news conference, Enrique Iglesias, president of 
the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], said the Venezuelan 
crisis is not as serious as has been reported. Following two 
working meetings with ministers charged with social issues 
portfolios, he noted that President Caldera's government should 
control the crisis in the public's perception of the country's 
economic problems. He observed that the monetary crisis, for 
example, is a key issue. It seems to be following a kind of plot 
that engenders a lack of confidence in the current 
administration. 
  Enrique Iglesias explained that other countries have 
experienced worse situations and overcome them with fewer 
resources. He is therefore "reasonably optimistic" that 
Venezuela will be able to "manage the crisis" and overcome 
difficulties. 
  Iglesias praised the government team's economic guidelines. 
He believes that the budget and tax policy, in conjunction with 
incentives for private investment, are enough to achieve 
economic balance. The Finance Ministry is coping effectively 
with the core of the problem, which is the fiscal issue, in an 
effort to balance the economy. Also, guidelines are being 
drafted so that relations between the private sector and the 
government will be consistent. 
  This year, the IDB will invest 50 percent of its funds 
earmarked for social projects in Venezuela. This sum is over 
$300 million. Regarding IDB conditions for the loans, the IDB 
president explained that the feasibility and profitability of 
the projects will not be the most important concern but that 
each project will be discussed with the head of each ministry. 
  The resources will be used in three fundamental areas: 
health, housing, sanitation, and potable water works. An urban 
transportation plan designed to improve the highway 
infrastructure in several states of the country is being 
contemplated. 
  The program, which will be cofinanced by the IDB and the 
nation's private sector, will have an accompanying plan for 
maintaining the country's principal highways. 
  Overall investment in the health plans will be $300 million, 
of which 50 percent will be contributed by the IDB and the other 
half by the national government. 
  Health Minister Carlos Walter, member of the social cabinet, 
explained that the money will be used to decentralize medical 
services, restructure the Health Ministry, and implement health 
education plans. He explained that the resources will not be 
used to equip hospitals, as he feels it is necessary first to 
restructure the health system in order to improve services. 
  In this regard, Iglesias added that "before spending," it is 
necessary "to improve the impact of what will be spent. This 
will be achieved by making the central administration more 
efficient."

to suspend importing and purchasing products for the nation's 
industry in light of the instability of the U.S. dollar in the 
Venezuelan market and the need to face up to the reality of 
costs and prices. 
  The announcement was made by Consecomercio President Berend 
Rossen, who warned of the inevitable shortage of goods and 
services supplied by this private sector company. "We need to 
implement a cost and price reality. That is why we are warning 
the national government, by way of the Development Ministry, 
that meetings with industrial sector representatives have 
already taken place and we have not yet been advised. It will 
depend on the government to continue with the Solidarity Pact 
which enables consumers to have affordable prices of vital 
imported goods such as food and medications. 
  Berend Rossen acknowledged that food prices had increased 
during the past weeks not only as a result of the rise in the 
U.S. dollar, but also for other reasons such as the 
implementation of the bank debit tax and the increase of the 
minimum wage. 
  With respect to the exchange rate situation, Rossen believes 
that the BCV [Venezuelan Central Bank] must turn to a much more 
open market such as the Caracas Stock Exchange in order to carry 
out currency bids since this will allow the price of the U.S. 
dollar to be fixed with more certainty. "There is the pressing 
need to put a ceiling and a bottom on the official and parallel 
currency market even when the commerce and service sectors do 
not support the currency control measures." 
  The monetary authorities should present formulas to 
stabilize 
the currency market once and for all in order to provide more 
security for importers and to ensure macro-economic equilibrium. 
At the same time, there should be attempts to prepare an outline 
for the procurement of additional "stand-by" type credits such 
as the one obtained by Mexico with the IMF under situations 
similar to what Venezuela is going through at this time. 
  Rossen proposed the future sale of gold and orimulsion on 
the 
market to compensate the drop in the currency market and he 
pointed out that this will help restore the climate of trust in 
Venezuela abroad. 
  Rossen is satisfied with the Venezuelan Government's policy 
of once again proposing an increase in the price of gasoline as 
another revenue alternative and as a way of preventing the 
flight of Venezuelan goods to the Caribbean, Colombia, and other 
markets where our gasoline and other products become contraband 
items. 
  On the other hand, Nicola Escapaticci, president of 
Consomercio Agriculture Commission disclosed that there is a 
limited supply of certain items. There is a sugar shortage 
because sugar is being illegally exported to Colombia; a rice 
shortage because of a fall in national rice production; and 
shortage of items such as powdered milk, which is being imported 
from New Zealand.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mexican Government Secretary Jorge </F>
Carpizo by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Jorge Carpizo, government secretary. 
Dr. Carpizo, good evening. 
  [Carpizo] Good evening. 
  [Zabludovsky] We have a question about the 21 August 
elections. You have asked the United Nations to send observers 
to the elections, to see how the elections are held. Yesterday, 
you said you will not permit any foreign institution or 
government to interfere. Would you explain this? It seems 
contradictory. 
  [Carpizo] I am delighted to be with you again. Your question 
is very pertinent. Many people have asked me the same thing, 
which means that it is necessary to explain the situation. This 
is a great medium for doing so. 
  There is no contradiction. We wrote the United Nations, 
establishing for the record -- I have the text here -- that our 
Constitution and our laws only authorize Mexicans to organize 
and assess the elections. This is by virtue of the principle of 
sovereignty, which means that only Mexicans can make decisions 
on Mexico. 
  After establishing this principle in the note to the United 
Nations, we told them that Mexico, as a member organization, 
Mexico as a sovereign state has made a decision and this 
requests two things: 
  First, that a mission of electoral experts be sent to study 
our electoral system and draft a technical report. This is very 
important. It would be a technical report. They are not going 
to judge or evaluate us. 
  Second, that the United Nations provide technical assistance 
-- the phrase is technical assistance -- to the various national 
observers so that they can really act impartially, 
independently, and objectively. The United Nations is not going 
to send any observer, absolutely no one. What it will do is 
send a UN group to our country before the elections, long before 
the elections, to speak to nongovernment organizations and 
render this technical assistance, provided these organizations 
accept that assistance. 
  In other words, Mexican nongovernmental organizations have 
every right to say either we accept or we don't. Fortunately, 
right now the Civic Alliance, which includes many nongovernment 
organizations, has accepted. It has accepted because this is 
good for all of us. 
  We do want observers, but we want national observers. We 
want only national observers. It is important that they know 
how to conduct this observation for the good of Mexico, 
independently but with complete objectivity and impartiality. 
This is all that is contained in the note to the United 
Nations, nothing more. 
  It is something quite different, totally different, when a 
foreigner or foreign government wants to intervene and tell us 
how to run our elections or give us advice. We do not need it. 
This would affect Mexico's sovereignty. That would be 
tantamount to meddling. Mexico cannot tolerate this for any 
reason. Many changes are being made in Mexico to improve our 
electoral laws, to improve all technical aspects of the 21 
August elections, but through decisions by Mexicans. The 
Mexicans are doing this out of their own convictions because 
society and the Government of Mexico want to take steps forward 
in democracy. Mexican society is asking, really demanding, as 
we all are, clean and crystal-clear elections. 
  If you will allow me, there is a third issue. This week the 
honorable Congress of the Union -- pardon me it was last week -- 
but yesterday, the official gazette of the federation published 
the reforms of our electoral laws. They are very important. 
These address the third issue, that of foreign visitors. Mind 
you, they would not be observers, by any standard. They are 
people coming to Mexico because Mexico does not prohibit anyone 
from coming. There is freedom to come and go. 
  What are we going to do, then, if they want to be here on 
election day? They will be given a document explaining Mexico's 
electoral system and what they cannot do. One of the things 
they cannot do is dare to evaluate the elections or judge 
Mexicans. These, Mr. Zabludovsky, are the three extraordinarily 
different issues, which differ from the other issue. 
  [Zabludosvky] It is very clear, Dr. Carpizo. I would like 
to ask a question on a totally different topic. 
  [Carpizo] Of course. 
  [Zabludovsky] A few moments ago this program reported that 
the Spanish justice minister, Juan Alberto Belloch, suspects 
that there are ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] people in 
Mexico. A deputy of the opposition Spanish Popular Party, who 
says he has clues regarding the presence of ETA members in 
Mexico, also has this suspicion. Would you tell us about that? 
  [Carpizo] Of course, several Spanish media have reported 
this 
for several months, and some Mexican media have echoed the 
story. Undoubtedly there are people in our country who come from 
Spain, who come from that part of the Basque region, but we do 
not have any evidence that there are any guerrillas. If we had 
proof -- this is being investigated and we will continue to 
investigate it -- Mexico would act according to the law. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much, Dr. Carpizo. 
  [Carpizo] Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity 
to be with you again.

<F P=106> [Article by David Aponte] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello declared that 
international observers "are not necessary" for the coming 21 
August presidential elections. The only factor that will give 
credibility to the elections "will be Mexican society, no one 
else," he noted. The chief of Mexican diplomacy explained that 
the Secretary of Government's request to the United Nations for 
electoral assistance and the current visit to the OAS, is an 
"act of sovereignty" by the Mexican Government. 
  In brief statements before attending a Rotary Club meeting 
in 
Mexico City, Tello said the UN Electoral Assistance Mission that 
will offer advice to Mexican nongovernmental organizations for 
the observation of the elections will be here in response to a 
direct invitation and does not attack the principles of 
sovereignty. This mission will be led by Nguyen Huu Dong. 
  The same case applies to the OAS mission, composed of Pedro 
Gordilho, from Brazil; Eduardo Ferrer, from Peru; Mario 
Gonzalez, from Colombia, and Ruben Perina, from Argentina -- 
with whom "I met on Tuesday," he added. That organization's 
experts -- invited by Arturo Nunez, director of the Federal 
Electoral Institute -- travelled to Mexico to learn about the 21 
August elections. 
  A reporter questioned Tello on the possibility of inviting 
international observers to Mexico. The diplomat replied: "My 
position remains the same: foreign visitors are not necessary." 
Why do you think they are not necessary? Because of the 
reforms that have been implemented and in the way the elections 
are structured, because of everything that has been done in the 
past years, specifically in the past months. 
  Horacio Boneo, director of the UN Electoral Assistance Unit, 
mentioned that the main problem was credibility. Can it be 
guaranteed that there already is credibility? It is the society 
that grants credibility and no one else, no one but the Mexican 
society, he replied categorically. 
  Later, the foreign secretary mentioned that the Foreign 
Relations Secretariat (SRE) is analyzing an OAS proposal to 
unite the diverse trade agreements in the Hemisphere for their 
possible merger with NAFTA. In the coming three weeks, the 
Mexican Government will make known its position on that 
multilateral organization's initiative, which by the way does 
not limit Cuba's participation, he indicated. 
  During the Rotary Club work session, Tello explained that 
the 
market globalization policies open the doors for new projects of 
international association that are "unexplored and promising." 
This could be the possible establishment of a hemispheric free 
trade area. 
  "If we want to optimize the benefits that a project of this 
type represents, we must guarantee that its design and 
application are compatible with the principles of open 
regionalism that would exclude unilateral actions. The 
dissimilarities in the levels of development must be taken into 
account and the effective distribution of the advantages among 
all the participating states must be assured," he noted. 
  The Mexican Government has observed that the promotion of 
trade exchange and the opening of the markets foster growth in 
the national economy. "Nevertheless, we do not ignore nor do we 
put to one side the persistent and lagging social drawbacks. 
The undeniable benefits of free trade should translate into 
greater well-being for the broad majority," Tello assured. 
  During the questions and answer session, a Rotary member 
took 
up the immigration matter with the United States: "What will 
the neighboring nation achieve with the iron curtain along the 
border?" Tello sarcastically said "absolutely nothing" because 
people avoid the curtain or they dig or drill holes in the walls 
constructed by the United States. "The SRE believes that both 
nations should find a joint solution to the immigration problem 
which will persist for many years and which could cause a 
conflict of greater scope."

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas State, met today with permanent 
members of the Chamber of Deputies' Congress Commission, who are 
helping with the investigations in connection with the Chiapas 
conflict. Camacho Solis made a very important announcement to 
several legislators who closely follow the talks. He said that 
in less than three weeks, a new plan to consolidate peace in 
Chiapas will be disclosed. Camacho Solis also said that right 
now the most important thing is continuing the dialogue, which 
he stressed is going well. 
  This meeting resulted in the issuance of a communique by the 
Senate and signed not only by [words indistinct] but by (Rubi), 
which says that right now legislators view the negotiations 
favorably. Nevertheless, they stress the need to implement this 
peace program as quickly as possible and establish the necessary 
mechanisms to ensure that peace is achieved.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de 
las Casas, Chiapas, was interviewed this morning at the Mexico 
City airport before traveling to Chiapas State. Elvia Moreno 
filed this report: 
  [Moreno] Good afternoon. Signing a piece of paper does not 
guarantee the fulfillment of peace and reconciliation accords in 
Chiapas as long as there is not a process of change and public 
action to change the attitude toward Indians and end 
discrimination against Indians, Bishop Samuel Ruiz said. 
Interviewed at the Mexico City International Airport, the 
bishop said that after the peace accords are signed, all sectors 
must be fully conscious of the new situation. This should be 
reflected in a profound change in the relationship between 
society, government, and the country's Indian peoples. Here is 
some of what Bishop Ruiz said. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] The situation has not changed much, 
nor will it change by signing a piece of paper. Only joint 
efforts that we must all undertake will generate change. We 
must change our attitude toward Indians. We must end 
discrimination against Indians, which occurs even here in the 
capital, where we find Indians on the streets. No one knows why 
they sell chewing gum on the streets [words indistinct] their 
community. 
  We must all be fully aware of this situation so we can 
change 
this relationship in society. The proposals and the Indians' 
answers will soon be discussed. [end recording] 
  [Moreno] The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas said, 
however, that Indians have noted certain modifications that may 
lead toward a different Mexico, even though it may not be 
perfect. Bishop Samuel Ruiz said today's Mexico is not the same 
as that of 31 December of last year, although it may not yet be 
ideal. This is the end of my report. Good afternoon. 
  [Announcer] Upon arriving in Chiapas State, Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz reported that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] 
had sent him a communique, which he hopes contains specific 
answers from the EZLN on their determination to attain peace. 
Maricarmen Camacho filed the following report. 
  [Camacho] Peace Mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he had been 
notified that an EZLN communique had been sent to him. He 
voiced his hope that this communique contains the EZLN's 
response on a date for signing the peace agreement. 
  The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas made these comments 
in his first news conference in Chiapas State since his visit to 
Rome: 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] Yesterday, I was called and told the 
EZLN had issued a communique. [Words indistinct] I will let you 
know what it is all about once I find out. I imagine it deals 
with the EZLN response to the government proposal. I imagine 
this will be a counterproposal, not to oppose but to change some 
points. [end recording] 
  [Camacho] Bishop Ruiz added that he will disclose the 
contents of the EZLN communique this afternoon or tomorrow. He 
also indicated that he will reveal the contents of a letter from 
Pope John Paul II to the diocese, expressing the latter's views 
on Bishop Ruiz's work as peace mediator in Chiapas.

<F P=106> [Report by Melina Villasana from the "Early Morning" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Secretariat of National Defense has said there 
are no secret weapons in Mexico and there should be no 
speculation on the purchase of equipment. The Secretariat of 
National Defense has presented its military industry: factories 
of weapons, cartridges, and vehicle assembly. Amid an atmosphere 
of reports and information on purchase of foreign-made military 
equipment, the Army has shown what it has: armored vehicles 
equipped with cannons and machine-guns with long firing 
capability. If water cannons were placed on these vehicles, 
they would be underutilized, the Secretariat of National Defense 
said. 
  General Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, director general of 
National Defense Factories, affirmed the Army's equipment 
guarantees national sovereignty. He added there are no secret 
weapons in Mexico and the purchase of weapons has nothing to do 
with what has taken place in other countries. 
  [Begin Cervantes recording] It is not convenient to 
extrapolate events in other regions to those in our country. We 
have our own experiences and our own institutions. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding arms supplies, we are self-sufficient. 
  [Begin Cervantes recording] It would be contradictory for us 
to ship out weapons and ammunition to areas where conflicts 
appear, when we promote peaceful solutions to conflicts. That 
is why we do not sell weapons. [end recording] 
  These are high-powered German-made weapons purchased in 1980 
for exclusive Army use. This is a vehicle assembly plant where 
military vehicles, some of which date back to 1942, are 
refurbished. Here is a 2,500 RAM truck, of which cabin and 
engine are used and mounted on a military vehicle. This is a 
vehicle manufactured in Mexico that will be presented to 
authorities. 
  In addition, cartridges of various calibers are manufactured 
in Mexico. Some 160,000 cartridges are manufactured daily, but 
the facility has a capacity to manufacture 300,000 cartridges. 
They are used to fight drug trafficking and are also sold to 
the country's high security ports. They are manufactured with 
automated machines. 
  Here is a factory of plastic and paint, ice picks and 
matrixes, which are marketed to obtain revenues. The gunpowder 
factory was closed in 1990 by the Sedue [Urban Development and 
Ecology Secretariat] for damaging the environment. Currently, 
gunpowder is imported into the country. 
  The Secretariat of Defense concluded by saying the opening 
of 
military factories is intended to calm the population and to 
instill confidence in their institutions.

  [Text] The head of the National Defense Secretariat 
(Sedena), General Antonio Riviello Bazan has affirmed the Armed 
Forces are not subordinated to the Mexican Public Security 
Coordinating Board (CSPN) and added that "we must join efforts 
so the government can serve the people better." 
  During a visit to the town of San Miguel de los Jagueyes, 
the 
Armed Forces training area in the Valley of Mexico, he noted 
that the newly created CSPN "does not entail a subordination (by 
the Armed Fores); it is merely a liaison element," among the 
different entities in charge of public security. He noted that 
the CSPN was created to place greater emphasis on the people's 
concern over security, which is why "we must must join efforts 
so the government can serve the people better." 
  Commenting on the recent acquisition of so-called riot 
vehicles, Riviello Bazan explained they are part of the entity's 
modernization plan that includes the purchase of diverse 
equipment. The secretary indicated the use of those vehicles, 
which he explained are not armored personnel carriers, will 
depend on requests made by local governments through the 
Government Secretariat should they find local public security 
entities insufficient. 
  He added that the country's Armed Forces can provide 
assistance to local governments, but only with the president's 
authorization, and in the case of organized violent actions. He 
also noted the vehicles purchased in the United States are not 
really armored vehicles. "Some of them are armored and carry a 
large amount of water, others can serve to break up 
disturbances." 
  The equipment consists of over 20 units with a capacity of 
approximately 13,000 liters of water, each costing approximately 
$100,000, according to Gen. Riviello Bazan. 
  The Sedena chief emphasized that the government does not 
intend to suspend the freedoms of expression or demonstration, 
adding that the use of those vehicles does not depend on his 
secretariat but on civilian authorities through a request filed 
with the Government Secretariat. 
  Gen. Riviello Bazan also noted that these vehicles not just 
serve to disperse demonstrations but also to protect the the 
security of institutions vital for the country such as Mexican 
Petroleum (Pemex), and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), 
among others. 
  Commenting on the conflict in Chiapas State, Riviello Bazan 
said it is a matter of concern for all Mexicans. "It worries us; 
we wish the process could advance as quickly as possible. As 
for the Armed Forces, we are determined to continue supporting 
the government's efforts." 
  On the matter of the number of people in the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN), he said: "We deem it 
inappropriate to comment on the matter; we do not want to hamper 
the dialogue or the development of the talks to achieve peace." 
  Gen. Antonio Riviello Bazan also talked about the support 
the 
Mexican Army is giving to this year's electoral process, which 
includes providing security for the nation's graphic workshops 
where the electoral material is being printed, as well as for 
the IFE's [Federal Electoral Institute] central warehouse. 
  He also stated that Mexican Army soldiers protected the 
movement of the electoral material from the nation's graphic 
workshops to the IFE's central warehouse and will do it again 
with the rest of the ballots. 
  The Army will also be in charge of the security of the 27 
local electoral boards in the states' capitals and of the 228 
electoral districts. It will also protect the transfer of 
documents to and from the local electoral boards to the 
electoral circuits. 
  When asked if the Armed Forces were prepared should the 
opposition reach power, Gen. Riviello Bazan said: "We are an 
institution that totally adheres to the law within the framework 
of the Constitution. We have no difficulty in that aspect. We 
are of a completely institutional nature, and with that I want 
to dispel any doubt on the matter." 
  In addition, members of the 66th Infantry Brigade conducted 
several military exercises in the presence of the Sedena chief 
to combat drug trafficking and to deal with other problems. 
  It was explained during the visit, that Mexican Army units 
periodically carry out military training exercises ranging from 
detection of targets and target practice to the destruction with 
explosives of trenches or hideouts of drug traffickers. 
  Mexican Army infantry battalions and air mobile units of the 
Mexican Air Force participate with live ammunition in these 
military exercises, conducted in this area which is within the 
jurisdiction of Huehuetoca municipality in Mexico State. 
  Members of the infantry battalions, ambulances equipped for 
intensive care, vehicles equipped with machineguns, and Bell 
B-12 helicopters, among others, participate in these exercises 
to fight drug traffickers or armed conflicts. 
  Members of the Operations Unit of the 66th Infantry 
Battalion, formed by 600 men, wear a helmet and a bullet-proof 
vest. Some members carry communications receivers which have a 
range of approximately 25 km. Others, who are part of the 
weapons support company, operate 81-mm mortars, machine guns, 
and grenade launchers. Each mortar grenade weighs 3.1 kg. 
  Each operations unit of the air mobile units group of the 
Mexican Air Force is formed by four Bell B-12 helicopters, which 
are used for various missions, and one Sikorsky helicopter 
gunship which fires 1,200 cartridges a minute. 
  On another topic, the Sedena issued a press bulletin 
responding to the Chamber of Deputies National Defense 
Commission regarding its request for information on the purchase 
of riot vehicles. 
  The Sedena reiterated that the purchase of the vehicles is 
part of a program for the Mexican Army and Air Force's overall 
modernization as a result of the current national development 
plan that includes various aspects such as education, updating 
of the legal framework, improvement of the quartering capacity, 
training, and the optimization of equipment of the troop units. 
  It added that the implementation of modernization programs 
and plans are based on the juridical framework that determines 
and delimits the Armed Forces' mission. This framework includes 
Article 29 of the basic law of the federal public administration 
and Article 17 of the basic law of the Mexican Army and Air 
Force, which establish that the Sedena secretary is responsible 
for organizing, equipping, training, managing, and developing 
the ground and air forces in accordance with the instructions 
received from the supreme command of the Armed Forces. 
  It added that Article 89 empowers the president of the 
republic to assign all the permanent armed forces to the 
domestic and foreign defense of the nation. The basic law of 
the Army and the Air Force establishes the Armed Forces' general 
missions. These missions include, among others, guaranteeing 
the country's domestic security, helping the civilian population 
in cases of public need, and maintaining order. 
  It indicated that Article 119 establishes that the branches 
of government have the obligation to protect states against any 
foreign invasion or violence and in cases of domestic rebellion 
or upheaval. Therefore, the Mexican Armed Forces must have 
specialized equipment and armament to face, among others, 
violent groups that surpass the capacity of the public security 
forces of the country's states. 
  It is for this reason that the institutions which form the 
nation's public force and that are guarantors of domestic 
security, must have the means to fulfill their missions, always 
trying to operate by dissuading those persons who, in violent 
groups, attack public order. 
  The special corps that comprise the Army's 
organization-operation structure include the Military Police 
(PM), which have the mission of protecting people and public 
property, and preventing pillage and looting during emergencies, 
among other duties. Thus, the vehicles used for riots will be 
part of the equipment given to the PM members.

<F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General Office's [PGR] Planning Center 
for Drug Control [Cendro] has said the area devoted in Mexico to 
narcotics crops "continually increases due to, among other 
things, the poverty created for years by low agriculture yields, 
the lack of infrastructure, and the low prices of agricultural 
products." 
  Cendro added that, after narcotics crops on thousands of 
hectares in northern Mexico were razed, drug traffickers moved 
to the southern part of the country, devastating forest areas in 
Veracruz, Puebla, and the tropical jungle in Oaxaca, Chiapas, 
Tabasco, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. 
  The PGR has admitted that production of narcotics, mainly 
opium, has increased in nearly every southern state in the 
country as a consequence of the reactivation of the opium market 
in the United States and Europe. 
  Oaxaca is one of the four states where opium fields are most 
abundant. These fields are located in San Vicente Coatlan, 
Coicoyan del las Flores, Miahuatlan de Porfirio Diaz, Oaxaca de 
Juarez, Pinotepa de Don Luis, San Baltasar Chichicapam, and San 
Carlos Yautepec, all of them in La Mixteca and the Southern 
Sierra Madre, where it borders with Guerrero state and the 
Tehuantepec isthmus. 
  Cendro reports that as a result of unemployment in Oaxaca, 
more than 2,000 Zapotec, Mixtec, and Chinantec Indians have been 
hired by drug traffickers to grow marijuana and poppy on their 
plots of land and store marijuana in their storage areas. This 
happens in Ejutla de Crespo, Ixtepec, and San Miguel del Puerto 
municipalities. 
  In Chiapas, Indian communities and Guatemalans, working 
together near the border with Guatemala, participate in the 
production of drugs. The Papaloapan River basin, one of the 
largest production areas located on the border between Oaxaca 
and Veracruz, has begun to be used as a distribution center by 
drug traffickers who force peasants to grow narcotics crops. 
  According to the Cendro report, the Pacific region was 
Mexico's largest production area from 1988 to 1992, and it 
elicited the strongest action by the authorities. 
  Sinaloa was the top marijuana producer, with 20.90 percent 
of 
the total that was destroyed throughout the country. Michoacan 
was second. In Jalisco, the area where marijuana was destroyed 
in 1992 and 1993 was three times larger than in 1991, 
particularly in the municipalities of San Sebastian, Tequila, 
and Villa Corona. Other municipalities have been more active, 
such as Hostotipanquillo, Magdalena, Colotlan, Pihuamo, 
Tecalitlan, and Ciudad Guzman, where vigilance was improved with 
1,500 soldiers, who have intensified the fight against the 
growing, harvesting, and transporting of drugs. This fight has 
been supported by Mexican Air Force and PGR helicopters. 
  In Sinaloa, which ranks as the largest grower of poppy, the 
area where this crop was destroyed increased by 74 percent in 
1992 and 1993, as compared to 1991. The destruction of crops 
took place mostly in Badiraguato, Mazatlan, and Choix. Last 
year, 3,552 hectares planted with poppy were razed in the state. 
  The municipalities most affected were Choix, Cosala, 
Badariguato, Ahome, and San Ignacio, where peasants continue to 
be hired on a large-scale basis to grow and harvest the 
narcotic. Irrigation systems and tools were observed in some of 
the fields that were destroyed. 
  Cendro says the production of marijuana has been steady in 
most Nayarit municipalities. Nevertheless, the usage of land 
increased by as much as 80 percent in 1993, mostly in the 
municipalities of Ixtlan, Huajicori, Compostela, Nayar, and San 
Pedro. 
  In Durango, eight times more marijuana was destroyed in 1993 
than in 1992. The increase in the identification and 
destruction of marijuana fields has been marked. The 
municipalities where this problem is greater are Armeria, 
Tecoman, Minatitlan, and Coquimatlan. This situation is caused 
by the weather conditions both along the coast and in the 
highlands. 
  In states where crops were less abundant, the strategy 
changed. This is what happened in Atolinga, Zacatecas State, 
where the Federal Judicial Police discovered marijuana fields 
interspersed with corn fields. In the Pacific zone, regarded as 
one of the largest producers, 24.7 percent more narcotics fields 
were destroyed than last year. 
  In 1992, the eradication of poppy plantations in the area 
increased by 24.69 percent compared with 1991, mostly in 
Guerrero State. There, 4,071.4 hectares, which represented 35.1 
percent of the total nationwide, were destroyed in 1992. Poppy 
plantations were located in the municipalities of Ajuchitlan, 
Copanatoyac, Coyuca de Catalan, Chilapa de Alvarez, 
Chilpancingo, General Heliodoro Castillo, Iguala, Jose Azueta, 
Leonardo Bravo, and Metlatonoc. 
  The Cendro contends that physical and socioeconomic 
conditions in Michoacan favor a high level of drug trafficking. 
As a result, Michoacan is one of the major producers of 
marijuana and, according to statistics, 3,231 hectares were 
eradicated during the 1992-93 period, which is a 60-percent 
increase over the previous year. 
  The mountains of Acuitzio, Apatzingan, and Tacambaro 
continue 
to be areas for growing illegal crops while Nuevo Urecho, 
Penjamillo, Los Reyes, and San Lucas are municipalities that 
have recently joined the program to eradicate illegal crops. 
  Heroin is produced in Michoacan, a state where there is 
virtually no eradication of poppy, which leads to the assumption 
that the opium comes from Guerrero State. 
  As for central Mexico, the Cendro reveals that drug crops on 
plots equipped with an irrigation infrastructure on ranches 
owned by Juan Jose Quintero Payan were detected in San Miguel de 
Allende. In addition, marijuana plantations have been detected 
in Dolores Hidalgo and Juventino Rosas. 
  A field of marijuana ready to be harvested was found in 
Tejupilco, Mexico State. Mexico State is considered a broad 
area for sowing and growing marijuana, particularly places such 
as the hills of San Vicente, San Miguel Grande, the highlands of 
San Pedro Limon, and along some of the road to Los Bejucos. 
<H5>  They Even Have Irrigated Agricultural Areas </H5>
  There is a generalized increase in the lands used for 
growing 
marijuana, expanding its scope of influence in the central area 
and incorporating new plots equipped with irrigation systems. 
  This practice promotes the relocation of this crop in areas 
that, because of their characteristics, yield a larger amount 
and higher-quality drug. These practices have been detected in 
areas bordering San Luis Potosi-Hidalgo-Veracruz and 
Guerrero-Michoacan. 
  As for northern Mexico, the problem of drug crops in 
Chihuahua is increasing, especially in the region inhabited by 
the Tepehuan and Tarahumara Indians. 
  In those regions, the Cendro notes, given the poverty levels 
among native groups, illegal crops are easily incorporated. In 
1992-93, there was a determined antidrug effort by the 
authorities in Baborigame. 
<H5>  Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa: the "Golden Triangle" </H5>
  Drug-sowing in the Tepehuan region include the States of 
Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. This area, also known as "the 
Golden Triangle," possesses the best conditions for the 
production of marijuana and poppy among all areas in northern 
Mexico. The Tepehuan region garners elements such as 
geographical isolation, poverty and social backwardness, which 
make it particularly attractive to drug traffickers. 
  The emergence of drug production in southern Baja California 
State is troubling. In 1992-93, marijuana plantations, equipped 
with a modern and working irrigation system, were eradicated for 
the first time since 1984 in the municipality of Comondu. 
Marijuana plantations have also been found near Guerrero Negro. 
  "Mobile" crops represent an option for drug traffickers 
because they can be removed easily and rapidly if the 
authorities detect them. During 1992, there was an increase in 
the eradication of plantations of this type in the States of 
Sinaloa and Sonora. 
  In the months of July, August, and September 1992, 1,559 
hectares of marijuana were destroyed in Sinaloa and Sonora, thus 
increasing to 33 percent the average of eradicated marijuana 
registered during the same period in the three previous years. 
  Reports indicate, however, a reversal for illegal crops in 
the municipalities of Alamos and Ures, Sonora State. The 
eradication of mobile crops in El Venadito's ejido in the 
municipality of Alamos, where marijuana was grown in plastic 
bags is worth mentioning. 
  Regarding poppy production, 2,713.6 hectares of poppy were 
destroyed in the states near the northern border. These 2,713.6 
hectares represent 23.6-percent of the total destroyed 
nationwide, and represents a 136.4-percent, 44.2 percent, and 
77.2 percent increase compared with the three previous years, 
respectively, the Cendro ends.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] Today's most important political news 
comes to us from the venue for a meeting of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party's [PRD] National Executive Committee. 
Developments in the past few days, in which National Executive 
Committee members have questioned the actions of PRD President 
Porfirio Munoz Ledo and accused him of violating party statutes, 
prompted the urgent meeting. It was called on such short notice 
that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, had to 
interrupt his political campaign to meet with the PRD's National 
Executive Committee in an attempt to reach an agreement. The 
PRD parliamentary subcoordinator has acknowledged that formulas 
and mechanisms for PRD unity are urgently needed. 
  Maria Elena Martinez de la Vega is staying abreast of 
developments. Maria Elena, good afternoon. How are you? We 
have heard that because they were being hounded by newsmen, the 
PRD's National Executive Committee decided to change the venue 
for its meeting, which is being held behind closed doors. How 
are you? 
  [Martinez] Fine. In fact, the meeting has been quite 
closely held, Pepe. The PRD's National Executive Committee is 
meeting at the home of Efigenia Martinez. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
Porfirio Munoz Ledo, Mario Salcedo, Lucas de la Garza, Jesus 
Ortega, and Ramon Sosa Montes have arrived -- in short, all the 
members of the PRD's National Executive Committee. They began 
arriving at approximately 1700 this afternoon. We do not know 
how long the meeting will last. Gilberto Rincon Gallardo told us 
they will try to smooth out the differences between various 
currents within the PRD so as to restore the party's 
institutionality. Thus far, no PRD member who has arrived at 
Efigenia's home has made a statement. We hope that when they do 
come out, they will have overcome their differences and we may 
be able to speak to a member of the PRD. 
  [Announcer] Maria Elena, this afternoon you gave us an 
advance report on what was happening within the PRD. You spoke 
to the PRD's parliamentary subcoordinator. He acknowledged it 
was urgent that PRD members find formulas and mechanisms for 
achieving badly-needed unity, especially at this difficult time 
in the electoral process. 
  [Martinez] Yes, those were the words of Gilberto Rincon 
Gallardo, who as you noted is the PRD's parliamentary 
subcoordinator. He said the various currents within the PRD 
must realize that formulas and mechanisms for achieving PRD 
unity and ending internal party conflicts must be urgently 
sought. We interviewed him today at PRD national headquarters. 
We were there since 1100 this morning, awaiting the outcome of 
the National Executive Committee meeting. Rincon Gallardo said 
the various party currents must unite and restore the party's 
institutionality. He also said they can reach this agreement and 
that it is urgent that this process get under way. 
  Pepe, as soon as any member of the PRD emerges, we will talk 
to him and report back to you. 
  [Announcer] Yes, of course, we will stay in touch with you 
on 
this topic of so much interest. Thank you, Maria Elena.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Leaders of the Democratic Revolution Party [PRD], 
grouped in the National Executive Committee, are meeting in 
total secrecy at party headquarters on 50 Monterrey Street, Roma 
Neighborhood, in Mexico City. The meeting is trying to 
establish a new alliance among all the party's factions, since 
the fissure in unity is threatening even the presidential 
candidacy of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. We will be in 
direct contact with our colleague Maria Martinez de la Vega from 
PRD offices for all the details on this meeting. 
  As Heberto Castillo said this morning, the PRD urgently 
needs 
to make a clean sweep of procedures, not people. Speaking this 
morning to ACIR, Heberto Castillo said the problem inside his 
party is not [as heard] that PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo 
has lacked the discipline to heed the mandate of the National 
Executive Committee. 
  [Begin Castillo recording] What we have here is a problem 
that arose because of Mr. Porfirio Munoz Ledo's disrespect for 
the decisions of the National Executive Committee. In the 
political reforms, a plan submitted to the Government 
Secretariat and voted on, but the vote [words indistinct] even 
comrade Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. He had to distance himself from 
that position in his 18 March speech at the Zocalo. The 
fundamental difference is that we, as the PRD, have proposed 
that electoral authorities be independent of the executive 
branch. The political reforms retain the government secretary 
as chairman. [end recording] 
  As Heberto Castillo reiterated, the problem within the PRD 
is 
the indiscipline of Porfirio Munoz Ledo. 
  This morning, we interviewed PRD presidential candidate 
Cardenas. A little more at ease, Cardenas said the problems 
within his party are normal for a democratic institution that 
does not hide its differences. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] I see no major problem. I believe 
this a normal arrangement in a party where we openly and 
publicly hold our discussions. We do not resolve our problems 
behind closed doors, but in public. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, </F>
Mexican presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, PRD, by unidentified station announcer in Mexico 
City on 19 May from the "Outlook" newscast] 
  [Text] Regarding all the problems that have surfaced during 
the last few days within the PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution] top leadership, we were able to speak briefly with 
Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who interrupted his presidential 
campaign to come to Mexico City for the agreements the National 
Executive Committee takes to achieve party unity during these 
very difficult moments in national politics. This is what PRD 
presidential candidate Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had to say. 
  [Begin recording] [Cardenas] Nothing that I know of, nothing 
out of the ordinary. As far as I understand, we are working 
normally. 
  [Announcer] Why did you recently say the media are 
conducting 
a smear campaign against you? 
  [Cardenas] Because this is the way we feel. I have noticed a 
smear campaign in articles and in commentaries. I realize I am 
only speaking in general terms, but more than one article seeks 
to run down what the National Democratic Front may represent, 
which is nominating me, and my own candidacy. 
  [Announcer] I ask because to generalize is indeed dangerous. 
I suppose you are not referring to us, Radio ACIR? 
  [Cardenas] Not necessarily. 
  [Announcer] Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, yesterday you 
denied alleged links with arms trafficking operations for the 
anti-Sandinist contras, sponsored by the CIA in Mexico. There 
is a book by Terry Reed and John Cummings entitled "Bush, 
Clinton, and the CIA Involved," which implicates you in gun 
running operations for the contras. Do you deny this and are 
you suing these writers? 
  [Cardenas] Absolutely. I can also say this information 
surfaced in Mexico several months ago and we now see that 
various media, which one would have thought them to be serious, 
are reprinting this. 
  [Announcer] Are you going to sue through foreign lawyers? 
  [Cardenas] We are going to seek consultation to see where we 
stand. If a lawsuit is called for, we shall do just that. 
  [Announcer] PRD leader Heberto Castillo [as heard] said the 
PRD's situation is very sensitive now and he mentions the 
possibility of a substitute president or an acting president. 
All this has to do with the case of Samuel Del Villar's as head 
of Federal Electoral Institute. What can you tell us about this? 
  [Cardenas] I do not see any major problem. I believe this 
represents the normal, in-house changes in a party where we 
openly discuss things for all the public to observe. We do not 
resolve our problems behind closed doors, but in the open. This 
may seem odd for a political party. 
  [Announcer] Regarding this same topic, what will happen when 
it comes down to a debate between a representative of your 
party, the PRD, and the director of the electoral registry? 
  [Cardenas] It will probably take place. The party will have 
to consider the terms of the debate, how will it take place, and 
then decide who will represent the PRD. What is not acceptable 
is that the Government Secretary should say who will represent 
the PRD in such a debate. Samuel Del Villar or others may 
possibly attend. The party's directorate will have to decide 
this. 
  [Announcer] We were commenting in this "Outlook" newscast of 
the ACIR Group that some political observers say that the true 
issue in the PRD's is power squabbling between the several 
groups that comprise the PRD. How do respond to this? 
  [Cardenas] I believe this is a mistaken outlook; there are 
no 
power quotas. All the main posts are already defined so there 
can be no reason to argue. 
  [Announcer] I thank you very much. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August 1994. 
  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce De Leon, the presidential candidate of 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, says he is willing 
to meet with the Zapatist National Liberation Front, EZLN, if 
that will help the peace process in Chiapas. He is worried that 
the situation is being used for propaganda purposes by the Party 
of the Democratic Revolution, PRD. In Manzanillo Municipality, 
Colima Department, when asked if he would be willing to form an 
alliance as suggested by other parties, he replied that this 
only demonstrates that these parties are unsure of winning the 
upcoming elections and demonstrates the incapacity of their 
leaders to govern the country. He added the PRI is not divided 
internally and will enter the election in full strength. 
Regarding the many changes that have taken place in the 
government, Zedillo said government officials who do not follow 
the president's directives should be removed. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 16 May 94) 
  PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo met with the 
Permanent Indian Council at the PRI national headquarters. The 
meeting was attended by representatives of all ethnic groups in 
the country. Santiago Caceres, an Indian leader from Guerrero, 
says Indians have been treated like children, not adults. 
Ernesto Zedillo admitted development has not reached the Indian 
communities. Zedillo said the support given to these 
communities should respect their customs, without paternalism. 
The Indian communities need genuine, participative, and 
determined support so that their conditions as equals, as 
established in the Constitution, can be demonstrated by their 
overcoming their needs. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0430 GMT 17 May 94) 
  Leopoldo Gonzalez Quintana, national press secretary for the 
Mexican Democratic Party, said foreign observers should be 
invited to give their impartial judgments of the elections. On 
the other hand, Francisco Ortiz Mendoza, press secretary for the 
Popular Socialist Party, says the party opposes the presence of 
foreign observers because it is the Mexicans who must vote and 
oversee the results of the election. He added that the 
anomalies that have been observed in the electoral lists are no 
reason for them to be disqualified or invalidated. (Mexico City 
Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 19 May 94)

  [Text] The executive branch believes that 80 to 90 percent 
of the coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug 
trafficking. Minister German Quiroga stated it has therefore 
been decided to regulate the use of coca leaf through a supreme 
decree. Quiroga, however, made some warnings. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] The decree states in what zone of 
the country this regulation regarding the industrialization of 
coca leaf should be implemented. We were under the impression 
that some coca farmers wanted to decriminalize coca production, 
but the government has no intention of doing that as the entire 
country is aware that approximately 80 or maybe 90 percent of 
the surplus coca leaf produced in Chapare is earmarked for drug 
trafficking. [end recording] 
  Minister Quiroga made a clear comparison. He said that on 
one hand, there is the good coca, which is used for chewing and 
for industrial purposes, and on the other there is the bad coca, 
and we must not forget that. The bad coca is essentially that 
produced in Chapare which, in turn, is used to produce cocaine. 
Therefore, no one should have any illusions that coca is going 
to freely circulate in Bolivia. That would be like giving 
cocaine carte blanche.

  [Excerpts] Military troops are patrolling Chapare Region. 
Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz confirmed this. He 
stated, however, that the military troops are not involved in 
the struggle against drug trafficking. "Right now military 
troops, like any ordinary citizens, are circulating in the 
Chapare zone and some of them are carrying out training 
exercises. They are also investigating the possible existence 
of narcoterrorism." 
  Soliz said the troops in El Chapare are subject to the 
Defense Ministry and not the Social Defense Undersecretariat. 
The under secretary said many peasants oppose the presence of 
the Leopardos [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas, UMOPAR] 
because they are involved in drug trafficking. 
  "Operation Amanecer was carried out in Sinahota, and within 
two hours some six kg of cocaine were seized. Moreover, 45 
maceration pits and 32 cocaine factories were found during the 
course of the day. This is really frightening because the 
average number of maceration pits UMOPAR members usually find 
ranges from six to eight per day." 
  Recently the government approved a decree referring to the 
industrialization of coca leaf, which was not welcomed by the 
leaders of the coca farmers. "There is a surplus coca leaf 
production that is illegal; these are illegal plantations. 
Therefore, the government can, by no means, authorize the 
industrialization of something that is illegal, as this would be 
illogical; it would mean violating laws and, I repeat, this 
makes no sense." [passage omitted] 
  Mario Soliz asserted that the said decree cannot be modified 
as the Chapare leaders have requested. In turn, he asked them 
to fulfill the commitment to voluntarily eradicate part of the 
surplus production. "What we want to say to them, in the first 
place, is: Gentlemen, let us eradicate 3,000 hectares because if 
we do so, the country will receive $20 million which it needs. 
We are not talking about compulsory eradication. The law 
clearly states that we must eradicate between 5,000 and 8,000 
hectares, but we want to reach a consensus." 
  Soliz then said that with or without a consensus, the 
alternative development plans and the voluntary eradication of 
coca plantations will in any case be implemented in Chapare. "We 
do not want to resort to violence because, after all, the 
government has the necessary tools to see to it that the law is 
respected, but we believe that interdiction is not the best 
alternative at this moment if we are able to reach a consensus."

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On this Sunday morning, the total UN trade embargo 
against Haiti sponsored by the United States went into effect. 
This is an attempt to pressure the Haitian military coupists 
into giving up power. 
  The sanctions include intensifying the embargo on crude oil 
and military products and equipment, in addition to an 
interdiction on all financial and commercial transactions with 
the Haitian military regime. 
  According to some observers, the embargo, to which the UN 
Security Council agreed on 6 May, could have disastrous 
consequences not only for the country's economy but also for the 
Haitian people. 
  Politicians and journalists in several countries continue to 
ponder how much longer the United States will be able to wait 
before it resorts to any pretext in order to justify a military 
invasion. Meanwhile, U.S. President William Clinton has signed 
an order barring all U.S. corporations from any type of 
commercial transactions with Haiti.

  [Text] On 19 May, Haitian provisional President Emile 
Jonassaint, not recognized by the international community, 
announced his government is going to take sanctions against the 
clandestine departures of boat people for Florida. Jonassaint, 
who was speaking during a news conference at the National 
Palace, explained that a decree dated 1980, punishing 
clandestine departures from the national territory, was still in 
force. Furthermore, the provisional president said a U.S. 
invasion of Haiti would be a crime. What can we do against the 
Americans, against the United States? They can reduce us to 
ashes in one minute, Jonassaint exclaimed during a news 
conference. 
  On the other hand, he announced that a Council of Ministers 
meeting would be held on 20 May to take immediate measures to 
provide food to the population after the total trade embargo 
goes into effect at midnight on 21 May. Sanctions were taken 
against Haiti in violation of the charters of the OAS and of the 
United Nations, Jonassaint exclaimed. He stated with indignation 
that he especially opposed the fact that during the vote of 
those sanctions against Haiti, the UN Security Council was 
presided over by the delegate from Nigeria, a country where a 
terrible coup d'etat recently took place while the international 
community said nothing. 
  Asked about the diplomatic isolation of the country, he 
pointed out that Haiti has always been alone, ever since its 
independence in 1804, recalling that even the countries Haiti 
had helped -- several Latin American countries -- excluded the 
black republic from the Panama Congress in 1825. In addition, 
Jonassaint warned that if the resigning prime minister commits 
an infraction, he will come under the provisions of the law. 
Jonassaint referred to the call for civil disobedience launched 
last week by interim Prime Minister Robert Malval.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 20 May (AFP) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina today said U.S. Vice President Al Gore's 
visit to Honduras on 24 May "is in recognition of the 
democratizing efforts" the country has made. 
  Reina added that Gore's trip to Tegucigalpa to meet with 
Central American presidents "is not by chance, because Costa 
Rica used to be the favorite nation; it is a message of 
recognition for the type of government Honduras has by popular 
mandate." 
  The Honduran president told journalists that such issues as 
the environment, human rights, corruption, foreign debt, and 
sustainable development with a "human face" are included in the 
summit agenda. 
  According to Reina, the objective of this meeting is to 
define the course the presidents will follow during the 14 June 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia, and the December 
Americas Summit in Miami. 
  Presidents Ramiro De Leon Carpio (Guatemala), Alfredo 
Cristiani (El Salvador), Jose Maria Figueres (Costa Rica), 
Guillermo Endara (Panama), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua), and 
Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel were invited to the 
meeting. 
  A Foreign Affairs Ministry communique states that the 
Central 
American presidents will arrive in Tegucigalpa on 23 May to meet 
on that day "as a prelude to the U.S. vice president's arrival." 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, Central American experts 
will meet on 21 May to draft a common agenda to follow during 
the summits.

  [Text] Contadora Island (Panama), 21 May (ACAN-EFE) -- 
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara today told ACAN-EFE he is 
quite concerned about the current situation in Haiti; adding 
that the U.S. invasion in that Caribbean country "is imminent." 
  A total commercial embargo against Haiti will begin this 
evening (0401 GMT Sunday) to force the military coupists to 
restore power to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom they 
ousted on 30 September 1991. 
  Endara, who assumed power on 20 December 1989 after the U.S. 
intervention in Panama, stated he is closely following events in 
Haiti, and he said the invasion "is coming." 
  Moreover, the Panamanian president deplored the way in which 
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez was arrested and 
taken to prison because he was president of his country on two 
occasions. 
  Endara, who said he feels a lot of sympathy for Perez 
whether 
or not he perpetrated any crime, said the case should have been 
handled differently because it involves a friend of the region. 
Endara added that another measure should have been adopted, for 
example "house imprisonment." 
  Likewise, Endara said he will travel to Tegucigalpa on 
Tuesday to meet with his Central American counterparts and U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore. The purpose of the meeting is to 
analyze the agenda for the "Summit of the Americas," to be held 
in Miami in December. 
  Endara, who will leave his post on 1 September, explained he 
has already talked with his successor, Ernesto Perez Balladares, 
to review everything that will be discussed in next week's 
meeting with Gore.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 May (EFE) -- It was announced 
today in this capital that the Colombian Government is opposed 
to possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti to depose 
provisional President Emile Jonassaint and to hand over power to 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Colombian Foreign Ministry sources, quoted by Emisoras 
Caracol Network, said that the Colombian ambassador to the OAS, 
former Foreign Minister Julio Londono, has arrived in Santa Fe 
de Bogota for consultations with the government of President 
Cesar Gaviria on the issue of U.S. intervention in Haiti. 
  The sources said that the official Colombian position will 
be 
stated on 6 June in Belem, Brazil, during the annual OAS 
assembly, which will be attended by the foreign ministers of OAS 
member countries. The Colombian Foreign Ministry last week 
rejected the designation of Jonassaint and stated that the only 
legitimate administration in Haiti is that of Aristide, who was 
democratically elected in 1991.

<F P=106> [Report by Emilio Vasquez Perez and Hilario Monroy A.] </F>
  [Text] The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has 
"adamantly" voiced its opposition to a proposal forwarded by 
U.S. legislators, who intend to act as censors and observers in 
the 21 August presidential elections, it was stated yesterday by 
Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, chairman of the PRI National Executive 
Council [CEN]. He said that, according to Mexico's legal 
framework, the task of observing the elections only involves 
Mexican citizens. 
  In his offices at PRI National Headquarters, the recently 
appointed PRI leader nevertheless explained that his party has 
no objections if national observer groups monitor the federal 
electoral process, or if foreign visitors learn about the 
development and results of the electoral process. 
  Pichardo Pagaza also said that, according to the Mexican 
legal framework, national observers are permitted. Therefore, 
the PRI endorses a decision adopted by the government of the 
Republic to invite the OAS to issue a technical opinion on the 
national electoral process' progress and to state its views to 
Mexican observers. 
  The chairman of the PRI CEN said: "We have nothing to hide; 
quite the contrary, we want the national and international 
public to know why we will win. We have no objection if private 
visitors come from every part of the world to learn about the 
developments in this electoral process." 
  In his statements, Pichardo Pagaza noted the way in which 
the 
PRI is taking part in the electoral race for the presidency: 
"We are waging a clean and honest campaign and election." 
  Nevertheless, the national leader of the tricolor party said 
he rejects the proposal presented by two U.S. legislators, which 
would enable them to be the ones who would examine and observe 
the Mexican elections. "Consequently, we reject the proposal 
presented by the two U.S. congressmen who illegally want to 
issue opinions on the Mexican federal elections results and 
process," the PRI leader emphasized.

  [Text] Enrique Ter Horst, chief of ONUSAL [UN Observers for 
El Salvador], said he believes the peace agreements could be 
mostly implemented by 1 June so as to "clear the table" for the 
next president. Ter Horst said hard work is being done to 
conclude this week the rescheduling of the agreements, the 
fulfillment of which have been delayed. "Efforts are being made 
to finish the discussion of the topics that are still pending," 
he said. "The effort to reschedule the implementation of the 
agreements between the government and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] is aimed at clearing the table. We 
have made great progress and we hope to finish this week," he 
said. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in his report to 
the Security Council that was revealed on Monday, made reference 
to the situation. He said he was concerned because some aspects 
of the peace agreements require special "urgent attention." 
Butrus-Ghali made specific reference to the topics of public 
security, return of former fighters to civilian life, and land 
transfers. 
  In view of the negotiation of dates, Ter Horst said that 
once 
an agreement is reached the only thing pending would be the 
operation mechanism, which will be up to the government of 
Armando Calderon Sol, who will be sworn in on 1 June and who has 
expressed his commitment to the agreements. The ONUSAL chief 
admitted the delays and said "much remains to be done," but said 
"great progress" has been made and that the parties involved are 
willing to fulfill their obligations. 
  The viewpoint of the ONUSAL chief contrasts with the report 
released by Butrus-Ghali, which points out that after 1 June 
"much will remain to be done" to complete the implementation of 
the agreements. In the report, Butrus-Ghali lists the topics 
that are still pending such as the complete deployment of the 
National Civilian Police (PNC) and the demobilization of the 
National Police; land transfers; the program for the return of 
the former fighters to civilian life; and the implementation of 
the recommendations of the Truth Commission. 
  Butrus-Ghali said the agreements called for the complete 
deployment of the PNC by the end of September 1994, but the 
government said the National Police will not disappear until 
March 1995 because the new police corps cannot yet face the high 
crime rate. Butrus-Ghali also said there are imbalances within 
the PNC that violate the letter and spirit of the peace 
agreements because military as well as former National Police 
officers were included in numbers that were higher than what had 
been agreed. 
  As for land transfers, Ter Horst said important progress has 
been made and that the second phase has already begun, which 
will allow the authorities to hand out land title deeds by the 
end of the month. This phase also saw the incorporation to the 
program of another 7,200 beneficiaries for a total of nearly 
25,000 persons. 
  Likewise, Ter Horst praised the progress made in applying 
the 
Truth Commission recommendations, especially regarding judicial 
reform matters, even though he regretted, on behalf of 
Butrus-Ghali, that the duties of the Supreme Court have not been 
decentralized. 
  As for public security, the ONUSAL chief coincided with 
Butrus- Ghali's report when he confirmed that irregularities 
have been detected in the hiring and transfer of personnel to 
the PNC.

  [Text] The peace accords are facing some problems, but 
these problems are being resolved. These problems in no way 
mean there is a crisis, General Mauricio Vargas (retired) said 
yesterday, who used the term "imperial arrogance" to describe 
the remarks by UN officials on the peace process in El Salvador. 
  Creating a crisis is an FMLN [Faranbudo Marti National 
Liberation Front] obsession, because "they are the ones who 
announce them and create them," indicated Vargas, who served as 
member of the government commission that negotiated the peace 
accords with the former rebels. 
  During a visit to the Legislative Assembly, where he went to 
discuss with some deputies the spirit of land transfers (one of 
the pending points of the peace accords), the officer denied the 
National Civilian Police [PNC] has been militarized. 
  The problem of the PNC deployment and the demobilization of 
the National Police is that there cannot be a security vacuum, 
and the government cannot stop fulfilling its obligations, he 
added. In making an assessment of the peace process, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that although it is 
irreversible some noncompliance still persists and that requires 
a commitment from all sides. 
  In his report to the Security Council, Ghali indicated that 
ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador] will reduce its personnel 
as the pending agreements are implemented and he noted the 
Electoral Division was dissolved, while the Military Division, 
which had 368 soldiers verifying the cease-fire, consists now of 
only 12 soldiers. 
  Gen. Vargas stressed that one of the issues not yet resolved 
is the issue land transfers, but he said that issue will be 
resolved with a law the Assembly is currently reviewing. The 
purpose of the law is to meet the need for legal security and to 
erase the uncertainty that there is no land for those who need 
it, noted Gen. Vargas. 
  According to official sources, the extension of ONUSAL'S 
presence in the country should not exceed three months because 
there is little verification work to do. "It is not proper to 
maintain UN intervention much longer," the sources said. 
ONUSAL Mission Chief Enrique Ter Horst said today "much 
remains to be done" regarding compliance with the agreements. 
  Meanwhile, President Alfredo Cristiani described as 
"logical" 
the expansion of the ONUSAL mandate, since some peace accords 
are pending. 
  Vice President Francisco Merino does not believe extending 
the ONUSAL mandate is necessary "for internal purposes." 
  He said, however, "to a large degree, the foreign presence 
can serve to make the international community respond to our 
financial needs so the agreements can be implemented without 
traumatic economic results."

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado] </F>
  [Text] We had always been wary, and we said so at the time: 
It is one thing to "offer" and quite another to "comply." We 
were (and still are) in agreement that an authentic pacification 
can only be achieved if the international community and the 
United States keep their promises to the former combatants in a 
timely manner. However, the fulfillment of promises made to the 
negotiating parties seems far away. 
  The Peace Agreements were clear: Direct measures should be 
adopted to guarantee the full exercise of the demobilized 
personnel's civil and political rights when they moved from the 
mountains and garrisons to the country's civilian life. This 
implied the commitment of the United Nations, the U.S. 
Government, and the so-called "friends of the secretary general" 
to help ease the reentry of soldiers and guerrillas into 
civilian life by giving them the means to be productive within a 
totally legal framework. The government demobilized more than 
30,000 soldiers prior to the scheduled timetable. The FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] also did its part 
(or so it is believed) by dismantling its "guerrilla army" 
(although we have always doubted that they dismantled their 
"people's army." 
  However, it seems that others were the ones that failed. It 
is a lesson we must not forget. The "offers" of aid were very 
similar to an astute ambush by the United Nations on the 
negotiating parties, which forced the latter to acquiesce "to 
everything." Both the United Nations and the Bush 
administration wanted to get rid of the Salvadoran problem 
without caring that this nation would be torn by the senseless 
criminal violence that would emerge from those agreements. Both 
parties (government and guerrilla) made the mistake of putting 
their faith in the United Nations and the international 
community, which, of course, have helped in terms of minor 
issues but have not confronted any problem in depth. 
  Two years and a few months have elapsed since "peace" came 
to 
El Salvador, and poverty is increasing among the myriad 
demobilized and uprooted people who cannot acquire jobs, land, 
or anything else. The paranoid attitude of these people makes 
one's hair stand on end and threatens to prompt new outbreaks of 
subversive violence. There is an organization of former 
soldiers that has already seized the National Assembly with 
everybody in it, including the president of the Republic. They 
have come in significant numbers to the doors of the Defense 
Ministry several times to demand war reparations. 
  On the side of the former guerrillas, it is no secret that 
there are bands of armed former guerrillas in combat formation 
and which are patrolling the north of Morazan and Chalatenango 
(in the north and northeast sections of the country), or that 
squads of former guerrillas are stationed in the Santa Ana 
volcano (to the west), the most important coffee region in 
Salvadoran territory. 
  These are not good omens for peace. The key point, however, 
must be in the hands of somebody in the U.S. State Department. 
Both the government and the former General Command of the FMLN 
must speak plainly to the people. They should, if there are no 
hidden designs, say that the ethical responsibility belongs to 
the United Nations and the U.S. Government, which, on other 
issues such as legal reforms, land distribution, and police 
matters, continue to project their imperialist shadow to push 
legislators against the wall. 
  The astute international policy of the new UN Secretary 
General's Office and the Clinton administration is the one of 
Pontius Pilate: They are washing their hands. Both apparently 
are asserting with their attitude that this problem has been 
handled by other people and that neither the United Nations nor 
the United States can afford to keep these commitments at this 
time. 
  The skepticism we originally voiced when criticizing the 
Peace Agreements has turned into a reality: The Salvadoran 
peace process has served to quiet the rifles and has allowed 
"commanders" of the former guerrilla to reach very lofty 
positions in national politics; nevertheless, regrettably, the 
people with the lowest incomes on both sides are the ones who 
have been sacrificed. 
  Nobody in El Salvador has the power to change this picture. 
Perhaps, when the "contras" and the "recontras" get organized -- 
as is already being envisioned on the horizon -- the 
international community will turn its eyes again to this poor 
nation. But, for now, we can only wait for the new pressures 
that will surely arise -- this, by what we can see, will occur 
before the end of the year -- after the new government is sworn 
in on 1 June. 
  The Salvadoran case is unique. Suddenly the "commanders" of 
the Marxist insurgents are "very chummy" with the democratic 
parties. There are 21 FMLN deputies who are living like small 
bourgeoisie, enjoying the sweetness of the "exploitive" 
capitalism that they once vowed to destroy. In only two years 
of political participation, most of the rebel "command staff" 
members are now wealthy businessmen. 
  In terms of the demobilized people, however, the situation 
is 
pathetic. Thousands are literally dying of hunger, and there is 
an even greater number of refugees and uprooted people who have 
not found sanctuary from their woes. 
  After 14 years, those people who once believed in "the 
revolution" are poorer than before. The war destroyed their 
humble homes, which admittedly were paltry, but, at least, they 
owned them. Now they are nomads and cannot feed their children. 
The same is true for hundreds of people who were uprooted by 
the war and remain homeless. 
  If this is "the peace" promoted by the United Nations and 
the 
U.S. Government, we do not reject the possibility that -- in 
less than a decade -- El Salvador will be entangled in strife 
once again.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfredo Villareal from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A criminal attack took place in San Salvador this 
morning. It is still not clear if the attack was criminal in 
nature or political. Again, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leader Nidia Diaz's [nom de guerre for Maria 
Concepcion Valladares de Sosa] bodyguard received the brunt of 
the attack and this time he was injured in an arm. The 
bodyguard suffered a similar attack three months ago. According 
to now FMLN Deputy Nidia Diaz, the attack was aimed at her on 
both occasions. She, thus, stated that former guerrilla 
commanders do not have any security to participate in politics. 
  Diaz's bodyguard suffered the second attack in less than 
three months today. According to the reports, Elmer Cruz 
Pineda, a PNC [National Civilian Police] member assigned to 
Nidia Diaz' security, drove the vehicle that was hit by 20 
rounds of 9-mm pistol and M-16 rifle fire. Furthermore, the 
attackers threw a grenade that seriously injured the bodyguard's 
right arm. 
  [Begin recording] [Cruz] There was an attack on Mrs. Nidia 
Diaz at about 0600 this morning. It is estimated that it was 
carried out by Army soldiers who do not agree with the peace 
accords. I believe there is no two ways about this. It can't 
be anybody else but them. 
  [Reporter] What did you do when you were attacked? 
  [Cruz] I fought off the attack and defended myself. I was 
alone at the time and I tried to defend myself. [end recording] 
  The attack was made on the same vehicle that was attacked 
last time; it took place in front of the political leader's 
house, located on Los Lirios Avenue in the University 
neighborhood, at approximately 0630. The attackers were fought 
off by just one man. They crashed their vehicle after the 
attack, leaving it approximately two blocks from Deputy Diaz' 
house. 
  [Begin Diaz recording] We no longer use bullets in politics. 
We are civilians and work within the institutional framework of 
the government. This event is very serious because we 
supposedly have guarantees and believe we can have confidence. 
I would like to go about without any bodyguards and move about 
just as any other person. All of a sudden this happens and you 
realize that you have to have a bodyguard. I feel it is much 
more dangerous because we have placed our trust is the system 
and have presented ourselves, with all our characteristics, our 
people, our relatives, under the protection of the government's 
institutions. [end recording] 
  Nidia Diaz, who now has a large group of bodyguards 24 hours 
a day, reported the charges to the joint group. 
  [Begin unidentified bodyguard recording] We have to be on 
our 
guard at all times when we are with her. We have to make sure 
we are not being followed. [end recording] 
  Definitely, the violence in our country does not stop and 
the 
people responsible for countering it have not found the means to 
do so.

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Iraheta] </F>
  [Text] Shafik Handal, FMLN general coordinator, has denied 
categorically that the attack on Deputy Marta Valladares [name 
as heard], who is better known as Nidia Diaz, was perpetrated by 
members of this political institution. Handal said that despite 
differing ideas within the FMLN, this violent act was not 
carried out by FMLN members. He, however, did not rule out that 
it was politically motivated: 
  [Begin Handal recording] I rule that out totally and 
absolutely. It was a dirty maneuver to cover up impunity, to 
keep impunity alive. I rule that out completely. My arguments 
are: one, we know each other in the FMLN. We know that an 
action of this sort is morally impossible. Second, this is a 
repeat of a similar operation. Thus, since then it has been 
clear that this is a typical case of a politically motivated 
action. This is among the cases that the Joint Group is 
handling. I reject that totally and absolutely. I even reject 
that this could happen among us at any time. [end recording] 
  Handal added that this morning's action, which left a member 
of Nidia Diaz' security team injured, is part of the political 
situation facing the country at present: 
  [Begin Handal recording] Second, I must stress that 
companera 
Nidia Diaz, as a deputy, is currently chairing the Legislative 
Assembly Justice and Human Rights Committee. At this time the 
Legislative Assembly is concluding debate on the elimination of 
secret presidency expenses and is about to start debating the 
problem of exemptions granted to deputies in order to start 
cleaning up their (?image). This is something that focuses our 
attention. 
  Another thing that focuses attention is that this act was 
perpetrated at a time when there is an ongoing debate within the 
FMLN. There is a debate within the FMLN. These are, I think, 
the first things that must be taken into account. I have little 
doubt, although one must always leave room for doubt, that this 
is politically motivated. 
  In fact, speaking about the other crimes committed since the 
latter part of 1993, since the latter half of 1993.... [pauses] 
that is, if we link this to the kind of campaign carried out by 
the right wing during the electoral campaign, I would conclude 
that all this was related.... [pauses] that there was a message 
in all that. The message is: Look, we can still kill! We have 
the means to do so; we can do so, and impunity still reigns in 
this country. [end recording] 
  The politician pointed out that no current investigation 
into 
politically motivated crimes has yet produced positive results. 
Handal added that as long as perpetrators are protected, the 
country will not be able to overcome impunity.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salvadoran General Mauricio </F>
Ernesto Vargas, former deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces 
and member of the Dialogue Commission, by unidentified reporter 
on 19 May; from the "KL Radio News" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Reporter] Good morning General. We want your 
opinion on the attack on the security guards of FMLN Deputy 
Nidia Diaz. 
  [Vargas] These incidents, not only against Nidia Diaz, but 
also the kidnappings -- all these problems are deplorable and 
should be rejected and condemned. We cannot permit violence and 
the principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth prevail 
in our society. Since 16 January 1992, Salvadorans are 
committed to taking a totally different path. The fact that 
this is the second attack on this same person, specifically this 
same security guard, is strange. I believe this should be 
thoroughly investigated and that the weight of the law should 
fall upon those who are responsible, so that the exemplary 
punishment can dissuade others from acting the same way within 
Salvadoran society. 
  [Reporter] Deputy Nidia Diaz mentioned the political 
connotations that this attack could have. As member of the 
Dialogue Commission, and within the framework of the Chapultepec 
Agreements how do you view these actions against a party like 
the FMLN which recently entered the country's political life? 
  [Vargas] As I said.... [pauses] although I did not say it 
directly, I believe it is somewhat strange that the attack was 
against the same person, the same security guard who was 
attacked the first time. As you said, this incident warrants a 
thorough investigation, as it could have other connotations. 
Attacks that could occur at a given time which could be 
directly or indirectly related to political groups should be 
rejected; not only against the FMLN, but also against ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance) the Christian Democratic 
Party, the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party, all 
political parties. 
  It is not possible for persons who disagree with each other, 
who have different ideas or ideologies, to react this way. This 
is unacceptable as a political system. I may disagree with your 
ideas, you may disagree with mine, but we should discuss our 
differences without resorting to violence. This is one of the 
basic principles we have established. We must exercise personal 
and institutional coexistence, so the process can mature and 
reach its maximum expression for the benefit of the entire 
society. 
  [Reporter] Do you think an incident such as this can 
undermine politics in El Salvador? 
  [Vargas] I would not say it could undermine politics or 
create a crisis. It creates an unstable political balance. 
This means that.... [pauses] we must remember that these are 
factors that go through cycles at a given time. I believe sound 
judgment, good sense, mutual respect, and above all prudence 
should guide our steps. Provocations should not produce 
visceral reactions because this will take us nowhere. It would 
take us to a polarized confrontation similar or worse to the 
ones we had in the past. Definitely, generations who went 
through that experience do not want to see the same thing happen 
again. In that sense, I want justice -- as the main factor to 
discourage actions that violate society rules -- to prevail. I 
believe a thorough police investigation is necessary. This case 
should be given more attention because there could be factors 
that are not political, which if not properly investigated can 
have repercussions in the political field, which of course would 
be totally undesirable. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Castillejos] </F>
  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 May (NOTIMEX) -- Central America 
will reiterate to the United States the need to define 
commercial ties between the United States and Central America in 
relation to NAFTA, regional official sources reported today. 
  The regional proposal will be presented to U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore on Tuesday, when he will meet with the 
Central American presidents in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, diplomatic 
sources added. 
  Sources told NOTIMEX that the area presidents will propose 
an 
interdependence relationship "between a program for peace and an 
agenda for development" to Gore. 
  According to a preliminary document yet to be discussed by 
the presidents before presenting it to Gore, a renewed 
international solidarity, "that goes beyond traditional 
assistance," will be demanded. 
  The sources said the Central American presidents will 
propose 
that the United States negotiate a "parity" or a "full rights" 
incorporation into NAFTA, whose members are the United States, 
Mexico, and Canada. 
  The draft document says the presidents will ask the United 
States to expand access of Central American products to the U.S. 
market, particularly within the context of the Caribbean Basin 
Initiative [ICC]. ICC is a U.S. Government program that 
provides tariff exemptions for Caribbean basin countries. 
  In addition, Rodolfo Doughterty, coordinator of the Central 
American Parliament's Export and Investment Commission, said 
that the Central American governments will demand recognition of 
their countries' productive capabilities. "Central America's 
incorporation into international markets is the highest priority 
in the presidents' agenda," he said. Central America is on its 
way to becoming a "model" region for the solution of conflicts. 
It is a region interested in consolidating peace and democracy 
through overall development, a diplomatic source commented. 
  In the 1980's, Central America suffered armed conflicts that 
resulted in the deaths of thousands and the displacement of 
hundreds of thousands of people. The region seems to have 
attained political stability in this decade, however. 
  In 1993, the 14th Regional Presidential Summit stated: 
"Decades of suffering and sacrifice have left the Central 
American people with deep scars but also with the necessary 
political maturity to admit that we need each other and that we 
cannot develop by excluding others." 
  Nevertheless, the document "Commercial Relations Between 
Central America and the United States," issued by the UN Program 
for Development [PNUD], admits that the world market does not 
operate in the region according to the perfect competition rules. 
  The Central American governments expect NAFTA to yield to 
them benefits similar to those obtained by Mexico, official 
sources said. The benefits that Washington grants Central 
America through ICC are less than those obtained by Mexico 
because, while Mexico does not have to pay tariffs for the 
export of its products to the U.S. market, the Central American 
countries still do, the sources pointed out. 
  Central America's trade with the United States is worth 
nearly $5.6 billion, with Mexico it is $556 million, and with 
Canada it is nearly $195 million, according to official sources. 
  Rodolfo Prez, president of Guatemala's General Association 
of 
Farmers [AGA], said there is interest in learning what will be 
the U.S. position regarding Central America. "We desire an 
opportunity with the United States. We do not want NAFTA to 
leave us out," he said. 
  According to the Central American countries, NAFTA could 
divert the trade or the investments of its most important 
member, the United States, toward Mexico, particularly regarding 
the export of agricultural products, textiles, and clothing, 
according to experts. 
  A document issued by the Central American Integration 
Secretariat, to which NOTIMEX had access, proposes to expand the 
area covered by ICC and the General Preferences System [SGP] so 
that more products of the region can receive special treatment. 
SGP is a system whereby the industrialized countries give a 
non-reciprocating preferential treatment to developing 
countries' products. Trade between Central America and the 
United States deals mostly with agricultural products. 
  This aspiration for preferential treatment was voiced 
recently by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who 
said: "With the end of the Cold War, we have a chance to become 
incorporated into the region, strengthen the democratic process, 
combat poverty, ensure respect for human rights, and advance 
toward modernization."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Costa Rican President Jose </F>
Figueres Olsen in San Jose and Honduran President Carlos Roberto 
Reina at the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa, by unidentified 
reporters at the Voz de Honduras studios in Tegucigalpa; from 
the "The Morning Paper" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Figueres] We are concluding the final details 
of our visit this morning. We have a great deal of hope and 
expectation. We are ready to spend this afternoon with you and, 
tomorrow, to attend the Central American presidents' summit with 
U.S. Vice President Gore. We hope this meeting will enable us 
to achieve progress in some of the topics that interest us in 
Central America and areas in which friendly countries can 
continue helping us. 
  [Reporter] Regarding the topics that will be discussed with 
the U.S. vice president, in your view, which are the most 
important ones that interest Central America as a whole? 
  [Figueres] Well, the trade topic is obviously of great 
importance. Each of our countries conducts a great deal of 
trade with the United States, and, in view of the signing of 
NAFTA by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, we cannot be 
left behind and lose a relative advantage with Mexico in both 
the areas of attracting investments and our competitiveness in 
this market. 
  In addition to the trade topic, I think another topic that 
is 
of great interest to us is the strengthening of democratic 
institutions in our region, not only during the electoral 
process every four years, but the strengthening of the various 
mechanisms and institutions that consolidate our democratic 
systems between elections. 
  Of course, other topics of great interest to us are 
environmental issues and sustainable development. God has given 
us a region that has a great amount of biodiversity. It has 
exceptional characteristics in terms of the international 
community, and we should take advantage of our natural resources 
in an effort to achieve greater overall benefit from them in 
terms of our production. Nevertheless, we must still protect 
these resources for future generations. 
  [Reporter] President Figueres, at this time, Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina wants to greet you over the Voz 
de Honduras Network, which has made possible this dialogue 
between the two of you in advance of the mini-summit of Central 
American presidents and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. 
  [Reina] Good morning, my friend, dear Jose Figueres Olsen. 
We are anxiously waiting to embrace you and, at dinner tonight, 
to discuss the points we will broach with the U.S. vice 
president tomorrow. What you said moments ago about sustainable 
growth and the strengthening of democracy is the implementation 
of what we both promised in the election campaigns that brought 
us into office. In the campaigns, we spoke about uniting 
Central America. We spoke about combined growth with a human 
face and about jointly facing economic problems to benefit our 
people. I am waiting for you today, my very dear distinguished 
friend. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Let us return to San Jose for the Costa Rican 
president's final message. Thank you for having participated in 
this dialogue with President Reina. President Figueres, please 
give us your message to the Honduran people, who are waiting for 
you with open arms in Tegucigalpa. 
  [Figueres] Thank you, Voz de Honduras, for the opportunity 
to 
participate in this joint interview. I think this is the first 
such interview that has ever been held in Central America. I 
hope there will be more. If there is something we need, it is 
to strengthen our ties and relations, shorten the distances 
between our countries, and to discuss our problems, challenges, 
and our hopes about Central America's future. I am optimistic 
by nature, and I think that despite the region's problems, we 
are pushing ahead with work, devotion, and effort. The results 
will be good. 
  [Reporter] We will now have a final message from Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina, whom we also thank for accepting 
Voz de Honduras' invitation. We have had President Figueres on 
the line directly from San Jose. Go ahead, Dr. Reina. 
  [Reina] I think the Central American dialogue has already 
begun for this meeting with the U.S. vice president. I warmly 
congratulate the media which have cooperated with us. It is 
extraordinary how the Central American people can be informed 
immediately and how they can follow events to form their own 
opinions about such important meetings.

  [Text] Lima, 20 May (EFE) -- Business people from the 
Andean Group (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela) 
garment industry and textile companies disagree over the textile 
industry's request to restrict Asian clothing imports. 
  The Andean Textile Federation proposed the establishment of 
minimum quotas and prices to the Cartagena Agreement Board 
(Junac) to restrict Asian textile imports that enter the region 
with undervalued prices. The Andean Garment Federation openly 
opposes that proposal because it believes the free market "is 
enough to face the unfair competition." 
  The garment industry also believes the quota system "is 
self-defeating because just as quotas would be imposed on Asian 
products, quotas could also be imposed on buying raw material in 
those countries and that would hurt us." 
  An organization spokesman said Junac experts, who apparently 
will meet in Lima today to discuss the issue, will resolve the 
disagreement as a last resort.

  [Text] Caracas, 20 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Andean Group 
approved a proposal to liberalize the services trade in the 
region, Venezuela's Foreign Trade Institute (ICE) reported. The 
proposal calls for full liberalization of the services trade in 
seven years. During that time, negotiations would be conducted 
to establish a market and a legal system in the Andean countries. 
  In the proposal, the delegates from Colombia, Bolivia, 
Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru say the legal and juridical 
standards will be applied to all measures affecting the services 
trade. In addition, the services provided in the exercise of 
governmental authority, such as state purchases, will be 
excluded. 
  The proposal places priority on market access, national 
treatment, and the most-favored-nation clause, which is 
unconditional with the exception of agreements limited to 
adjacent border areas. 
  The plan, which must be approved by the Andean Pact's board 
of directors, stipulates the commitment to define community 
standards on subsidies for services one year prior to the 
implementation of the measure. The plan also provides for 
special transit methods, the temporary presence of persons, and 
the recognition and qualification of professional certificates, 
which cannot be valid for more than three and a half years. 
  The Foreign Trade Institute states that "the document 
emphasizes the need to create an Andean council for services 
trade to advise and assist member countries.

  [Text] Representatives of the Federation of Central 
American Industrial Chambers and Associations (Fecaica) have 
said the signing of bilateral treaties between Central American 
countries and Mexico is jeopardizing fragile regional 
integration. 
  Juan Jose Gutierrez, Guatemalan Chamber of Industry 
president 
and Fecaica Guatemalan representative, said: "Aside from the 
treaty signed between Mexico and Costa Rica, we believe that as 
the Central American countries negotiate bilateral treaties with 
Mexico, they are jeopardizing the integration process, which is 
still fragile." 
  Carlos Enrique Rivera, Fecaica executive director; Luis 
Mejia, Salvadoran Industrialists Association president; and 
Gutierrez himself reported that one of the most important 
resolutions of the bimonthly Fecaica meeting was the need to 
negotiate any commercial treaty as a bloc. 
  We believe the efforts and work of so many years would be 
lost, and Central America would not be able to subsist without 
integration," added Gutierrez, also president of the Pollo 
Campero restaurant chain. 
  Fecaica representatives urged their Nicaraguan counterparts 
to "accompany Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in 
negotiating with Mexico, which, in their opinion, will benefit 
Nicaragua. In addition, they said Nicaragua can negotiate 
preferential aspects that Mexico has offered . 
<H5>  Fecampco Agrees </H5>
  Rivera added that the Federation of Central American 
Chambers 
of Commerce (Fecampo) and the Federation of Export Chambers 
(Fecaexca) agreed to support Fecaica's joint declaration in the 
sense that negotiations with third countries will be carried out 
jointly, not on a bilateral basis. 
  Fecaica representatives met on 20 May with Salvadoran 
Economy 
Minister Enrique Cordova, who informed the Central American 
industrialists of the progress made in negotiations with Mexico. 
  Another Fecaica resolution deals with the deadline the 
governments have established for signing the treaty, which is 
supposedly set for December of this year. In that sense, Leonel 
Mejia, president of ASI [Salvadoran Industrialists Association], 
said "signing a treaty quickly does not make it good." 
  Upon returning from a meeting with Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon 
Sol recently announced his intention to sign a treaty with 
Mexico before the end of this year, if possible.

  [Text] Contadora Island, Panama, 21 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The 
island paradise of Contadora, which saw the birth of the first 
peace-keeping group in Central America, was the backdrop for the 
inauguration of the Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission 
meeting. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio and Jose 
Raul 
Mulino, her Panamanian counterpart, gave speeches noting the 
"historic" opportunity of this meeting. In view of the change 
of governments in their respective countries, this will be the 
ministers' last joint effort within the framework of the 
Contadora Group, an organization named after the island and 
founded in the eighties by Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and 
Mexico as part of the peace-keeping efforts on the isthmus. 
  Agreements are expected to be signed on cultural issues, 
procedures for common border delimitation, the desolate Darien 
Gap, and a revision of terms for a ferry service to cross the 
Caribbean Sea and link the two countries. 
  Sanin praised Contadora saying Panama wrote "some of the 
most 
important pages of its integration and sovereignty" here. Mulino 
said: "We have now redeemed" its name because "the Panamanian 
dictatorship once spoke here of taking democracy to other 
nations." 
  According to the Colombian foreign minister, the 
Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission has gone beyond 
mere words and has contributed to a positive change in bilateral 
relations. She said Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez 
Balladares has guaranteed the continuity of the bilateral 
integration process and commercial opening. 
  Sanin hopes Panama will "quickly" join the Group of Three 
(Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela) through the integration clause 
after its members sign the commercial agreement on 13 June. 
  The meeting will also serve to review regulations on the 
status of illegal immigrants in each country and the expansion 
of national parks for the protection of the environment. 
  Representatives of the banking and financial sectors also 
attended the meeting, a move that was greeted with enthusiasm by 
Sanin and Mulino, who head the commission. 
  The meeting participants will study the bilateral "open 
skies" policy and a proposal to recognize the dual nationality 
of Indians in border areas. Sanin stated: "We cannot deny it to 
them. They have always lived it and exercised it." 
  For his part, Mulino said the common border delimitation 
will 
become a reality before his term ends on 1 September. 
  The ferry that will link Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) and 
Colon (Panama) on the Caribbean Sea will begin operating on 4 
December, it was explained today during the bilateral meeting in 
which private business delegations participated. 
  During its 16-hour transit, the ferry will be able to 
transport 400 passengers in 150 comfortable cabins, 20 trucks or 
buses, and 100 private vehicles. The ferry tickets will cost 
$85 to $150 per person per day, including all expenses, and $200 
to $1000 per vehicle, according to its size. 
  Sanin was accompanied by Jorge Bendeck, public works and 
transportation minister; Communications Minister William 
Jaramillo; and Gustavo Gaviria, Colombian private sector 
representative. Mulino was accompanied by Panamanian Vice 
President Guillermo Ford and business leader Ricardo Aleman.

  [Text] The National Assembly of the People's Government 
recently entrusted the government with the adoption of measures 
to gradually eliminate and avoid the repetition of the problems 
regarding excess currency that currently affect us, and which 
are an obstacle to Cuba's economic recovery. Among these 
measures was the possibility of raising the prices and fees of 
selected products and services that are not considered basic 
necessities. 
  Considering these elements, the Executive Committee of the 
Council of Ministers adopted, at the suggestion of the Ministry 
of Finance and Prices, several measures relating to prices and 
fees, and applicable from the date indicated in each case. 
  The first decision establishes retail prices for cigarettes 
sold in boxes of 20. In the case of (Rubio) cigarettes, the 
price will be 2.50 pesos for those sold through the basic 
controlled quota; 6.50 for those sold though controlled 
distribution; and 10.50 for those sold uncontrolled. In each of 
these cases, black cigarettes will be sold at 2, 6 and 10 pesos, 
respectively. These prices will go into effect for the next 
selling cycle which begins on 1 June. 
  In the meantime, until a balance is established between 
production and consumption, a measure leaning toward 
liberalization of cigarette sales could be developed at prices 
adjustable to market demand. 
  Regarding twisted tobacco [tabaco torcido], the agreement of 
the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers establishes 
the following prices per unit, according to the conditions of 
sale: twisted tobacco through the controlled basic quota, one 
peso; twisted tobacco through controlled sale, which is 
currently a minimal figure, two pesos for Nacionales, Coronas, 
and the regular Cazadores; three pesos for the special Cazadores. 
  These prices will become effective for the next selling 
cycle 
which begins on 1 June. Corresponding prices for twisted tobacco 
of superior quality, which could be produced in the future, will 
be established for each case. With the stabilization of 
production and consumption, a policy leaning toward free sale of 
twisted tobacco at prices adjusted to the behavior of the market 
could be developed. 
  Beer distributed in a controlled manner will cost 1.20 pesos 
for a 350-milliliter container, 1.70 for a 500-milliliter 
container or its equivalent when sold in large quantities. The 
price for a bottle of rum will be 40 pesos for class A, 30 for 
class B, and 20 for class C. Brandy will cost 20 pesos per 
bottle. These prices will become effective for the next selling 
cycle beginning on 1 June. 
  As production and consumption are stabilized, measures will 
lean toward the free sale of beer and alcoholic beverages at 
prices adjustable to market behavior. In restaurants and 
recreation centers, prices will be adjusted according to 
increases in retail sales. 
  Fuel for private vehicles will carry the following prices: 
Special gasoline will be sold at 1.20 per liter; regular at one 
peso per liter; gas-oil or diesel, 75 cents per liter. These 
prices will become effective during the next sales cycle which 
begins on 1 June. 
  Fees for electric service to the residential sector will be 
as follows: the first 100 kilowatt-hours of monthly consumption, 
the current 9 cents per kilowatt-hour; between 100 and 300 
kilowatt-hours of monthly consumption, 20 cents per 
kilowatt-hour; for over 300 kilowatt-hours, 30 cents per 
kilowatt hour. The new tariffs will become effective in 
September to be charged in October. 
  In the case of electric service, the agreement explains that 
the application of the new tariffs does not exclude the 
interruption of service for those consumers who repeatedly 
exceed the assigned monthly consumption plan. 
  Regarding transportation fees, the agreement establishes, 
with the exception of urban and suburban services, a universal 
increase of 60.8 percent in train transportation, 80 percent in 
airplane transportation, and 116 percent in nonurban bus 
transportation. Furthermore, apart from the boarding and [word 
indistinct] price, each ticket will have a minimum price. In the 
same manner, vouchers will be given to workers and students for 
transportation between their residences and work or education 
centers. Second-class train tickets for medium distance, 
interurban service and local service will be reduced. 
  Regarding fees for water and sewage service to the 
residential sector, the agreement proposes that the current 
tariffs for the metered water system be maintained and that a 
fixed rate of one peso per person per household be established 
for water service when consumption is not monitored by meters. 
  It has also been decided that fees for national and 
international postal and telegraphic services will be adjusted 
to the average of international costs and prices. 
  Furthermore, state entities are authorized, along with labor 
unions, to adjust and modify retail prices of meals offered at 
workers' cafeterias, a measure that will become effective on 1 
July.

  [Text] Today, TRABAJADORES published an article criticizing 
statements on Cuba by U.S. President William Clinton. In his 
article, reporter and analyst Nicanor Leon Cotallo points out 
that Clinton's recent statements on Cuba are part of the 
strategy suggested by his advisers to obtain an electoral 
victory in the State of Florida. Leon goes on to say that 
Clinton's 20 May attacks on the Cuban Government demonstrate 
that obtaining a victory in that state during the 1996 elections 
has become an obsession for the president's team of advisers. 
  In his article, Leon states that this goes hand in hand with 
the viewpoint of the most extreme right and the intolerant 
factions of the Cuban community in Florida. Leon goes on to say 
that even though Clinton is not part of the extreme right, as 
his successors Ronald Reagan and George Bush were, he must know 
very little about Cuba, the only explanation for his error, or 
lack of precision in talking about a long history of cooperation 
and mutual admiration between Cuba and the United States. 
  Regarding Clinton's defense of the blockade against Cuba, 
the 
article in TRABAJADORES states that this contradicts the 
agreements of the UN General Assembly and the opinion of the 
principal U.S. newspapers.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], said Cuba 
seeks, through the peoples' parliaments, participation of the 
entire population in the making of national decisions. In an 
interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, prior to departing for 
England on an official visit, the president of the ANPP harshly 
criticized what he called the fiction by the so-called 
representative democracies. Alarcon said such representation is 
limited to the electoral act, and that from that moment on, 
there is no relationship between the citizen who voted and the 
politician. National sovereignty is therefore limited to one day 
every few years. 
  Alarcon also referred to the experience gained by Cuba 
during 
the recent process, prior to the adoption of diverse measures to 
restructure the economy and the battle against illegal profit, 
preceded by celebration by more than 80,000 assemblies at work 
centers. 
  In discussing future participation of the ANPP in the 
application of the accorded measures, Alarcon said the ANPP is 
responsible for control of the practical application of those 
measures in a way never achieved by similar bodies in other 
political systems. Alarcon went on to say: We will control and 
oversee application of the national budget through the direct 
work of each entity or province in coordination with 
administrative authorities exchanging ideas for the reduction of 
subsidies and the increase of state income.

  [Text] Antisocial behavior has proliferated regarding 
tourism development in our country. Today, the National 
Commission for Prevention and Social Attention, presided over by 
Comrade Vilma Espin, visited various tourist facilities in 
Havana City to verify ideas, opinions, and suggestions firsthand 
on pernicious conduct and its effects upon the image of national 
dignity. When we asked her opinion about tourism officials who 
believe that closing their doors to those elements would affect 
business in that sphere, Vilma Espin said: 
  [Begin Espin recording] Evidently, someone like that should 
not work in tourism or anything related to obtaining hard 
currency. They do not have the moral and ethical conditions 
required to do such delicate work, which is so important to the 
country. What we would accomplish by doing this would be nothing 
more than to discredit tourism in Cuba. I heard of some 
businessmen like that. It causes some concern among people who 
are sympathetic toward Cuba. No prestigious tourism organization 
in the world markets its product through an image of 
(?prostitution). [end recording]

destroyed and 245 partially destroyed. That figure could rise. A 
man showed me the roof of his house, which was about to 
collapse. This situation can be seen in several homes. 
  Ninety-two people remain evacuated. Damages to the electric 
system have increased. Because of damages to the fuel tanks, 
three units of the Rente power plant are completely paralyzed. 
There is also significant damage to roads and telephone lines. 
That is why information from those municipalities is limited. 
According to Ruben Vidaud, first secretary of the Communist 
Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, the city has 
taken steps in case the situation grows worse. 
  After approximately one week of rain in Santiago, people are 
wondering how long this situation will continue. The intense 
rainfall begins at night and lasts throughout the night and into 
the morning. At dawn, they wake up to the images that we have 
seen. [end recording] 
  For its part, Guantanamo Province, which was also affected 
by 
intense rain, suspended classes until weather conditions 
improve, with the exception of mid-level classes at boarding 
schools. This Provincial Defense Council measure was taken to 
prevent accidents and deaths. Rosa Maria Fernandez reports from 
Guantanamo. 
  [Begin Fernandez recording] The people of Guantanamo are 
serenely confronting the adverse conditions caused by the rain 
since 18 May, especially yesterday evening and morning. There 
was intense rain, strong winds, and lightning throughout the day 
and a total of 123 millimeters of rain fell. The province has an 
average of 276 ml of rain so far this month, which is 40 percent 
over the usual average for May. The dams continue to overflow. 
The dam with highest capacity, (La Yaya), is releasing 525 cubic 
meters per second causing floods downstream. This has affected 
numerous agricultural areas. 
  Likewise, the dams close to the Salt mines in Caimanera are 
completely full, which has caused flooding in the lower areas. 
The municipalities of Yateras, Niceto Perez, El Salvador, and 
Maisi are completely cut off. Serious damage to the Farola road 
has rendered Baracoa completely inaccessible and has cut 
communications to Maisi. Also, Guantanamo Province does not have 
access to neighboring provinces by road or train. 
  This entire situation has brought about the evacuation of 
more than 7,800 people, 3,202 of which are being sheltered by 
the state. The rest of the people are receiving warm help at 
private residences from solidary neighbors and relatives. 
  So far, 764 homes have been affected by the storm, eight of 
which were completely destoyed. In that sense, the 
municipalities most affected are Guantanamo, Yateras, and Imias. 
It has also been necessary to evacuate more than 12,000 heads of 
cattle. The Provincial Defense Council's concern as well as that 
of the State's highest leadership, which has kept itself 
informed on the decisions made and solutions determined 
regarding each case, is constant. 
  There is a reason for saying water costs the people of 
Guantanamo a lot: sometimes because there is too little water; 
other times because there is too much. Nevertheless, we continue 
our struggles against nature because life goes on. [end

  [Text] The rains that have fallen in Santiago de Cuba 
Province since 16 May have caused considerable agricultural 
damage. The sugar harvest has been completely paralyzed because 
of road conditions and flooding in the sugarcane fields. 
Meanwhile, other crops have also reported serious damage. 
  In Segundo Frente Municipality, 50,000 plantain plants, 
2,500 
coffee trees, a coffee plant nursery, and many caballerias of 
mixed vegetables have been lost. In the Julio Antonio Mella 
region, 50 caballerias of sugarcane are flooded. Provincial 
authorities estimate losses throughout the province.

<F P=106> [By ``special correspondent'' Arturo Gudino] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 May (AFP) -- Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, presidential candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary 
Party (PRD), has appealed to Dominicans to engage in peaceful 
resistance "in favor of a patriotic solution" to the crisis 
unleashed by the controversial 16 May general elections. 
  In a televised appearance Sunday night [22 May], Pena Gomez 
also warned that the vote-by-vote count by the Central Electoral 
Board (JCE), which is scheduled to begin Wednesday, will be 
meaningless unless it is determined beforehand how many citizens 
were unable to vote. He also appealed for prayer meetings to be 
held Wednesday in churches nationwide and asked supporters to 
avoid confrontations with the Army and police. 
  A week after the elections, which the PRD called fraudulent, 
the JCE still has not proclaimed a winner. 
  Pena Gomez, a 57-year-old black leader, and veteran 
President 
Joaquin Balaguer, 87, who is seeking reelection to a seventh 
term in four decades, were the favorites in the presidential 
election. 
  According to Pena Gomez, the vote-counting center of the 
JCE, 
in collusion with two of the JCE magistrates, staged a "colossal 
fraud" by altering the lists of voters, preventing approximately 
200,000 people from voting. 
  For his part, Fernando Alvarez, vice presidential candidate 
of the PRD, opposed to the ruling party, said "five types of 
fraud" were detected in favor of Balaguer. Alvarez declared: 
"This crime cannot go unpunished. Whether it is with new 
elections or complementary elections in those places where 
irregularities were detected, Dr. Pena Gomez will be president 
of the Dominican people as of 16 August," the date established 
by law for the new government to take office. 
  In light of the charges of fraud, Balaguer's government, 
through the Nationalist Union comprising businessmen and 
intellectuals, launched an intense campaign, starting the middle 
of last week, alleging that the United States and France are 
seeking to merge the Dominican Republic and Haiti soon to quell 
the crisis in Haiti. According to the Nationalist Union, the 
post-electoral crisis is being used by Western powers to 
destabilize the country and eventually justify military 
intervention, after which the "merger" would follow. 
  The campaign has caused alarm in some sectors of the 
population, above all, among those less politically cultured, 
who speak openly in the streets of the danger of "integration" 
with Haiti. With a predominantly mulatto population of 7 
million, Dominicans do not view their neighboring Haitians, 
mostly blacks who are illiterate and live in a state of poverty, 
in a good light. 
  Pena Gomez urged that whenever power outages occur, as took 
place frequently during the elections, the people go out and 
light candles on the sidewalks. "We must cover the sidewalks 
with burning candles," Pena told his supporters, urging them not 
to respond violently to "enemy provocations." 
  "In the face of fraud, we are not going to stand by," the 
PRD 
candidate stated. Equally as bad as interventionism -- promoted 
by the ruling party -- is continuing with the status quo, which 
he said has been the cause of all revolutions that have shaken 
humanity and the Dominicans in general. 
  On Monday, the city of Santo Domingo with 2.5 million 
inhabitants appeared calm and business activities appeared to 
have regained normalcy, but citizens remained gripped by tension 
and uncertainty.

  [Text] This trade embargo does not apply to food and 
medicines. It went into effect against Haiti on the night of 21 
May at 2359, that is, 0359 GMT on 22 May, following this 
country's military refusal to resign. Total calm reigns in the 
Haitian capital. 
  I am a hostage of the situation and I am organizing myself 
to 
survive, a small shopkeeper said in summing up the reactions 
observed a short time before the embargo went into effect. 
  The Port-au-Prince harbor worked until the last minute, 
unloading the hundreds of containers bringing, from everywhere, 
goods ordered from abroad intended to last for several months. 
The fuel-smuggling at the Haitian-Dominican border continued 
like in preceding days, done to survive by a destitute peasantry 
scurrying like ants, using empty plastic one-gallon containers 
once used to hold cooking oil. 
  On 21 May, the government of provisional President Emile 
Jonassaint, which is not recognized by the international 
community, announced a special committee had been created to 
manage the sanctions. 
  In point of fact, we are unfortunately accustomed to this 
tragic status quo. Therefore, [words indistinct] the owner of a 
small working-class restaurant comments with resignation, who 
like the man-in-the-street is convinced it is the poorest who 
will suffer the most, as usual. 
  On the economic plane, it is the latest jobs in the 
subcontracting companies -- 8,000 to 10,000 according to the 
U.S. Embassy; 6,000 to 8,000 according to employers' sources -- 
that will disappear following this embargo. But the peasantry is 
going to be hit very hard by the halt in coffee and cocoa 
exports, the nation's second most important export activity 
after the subcontractors which brings in about $15 million at a 
time when international prices have risen. The OAS trade embargo 
instituted in October 1991 and intensified by a UN oil embargo 
in 1993 has already cost the nation 200,000 jobs. The 
unemployment rate in Haiti exceeds 60 percent. Decided by a 6 
May vote of the UN Security Council, the total embargo aims to 
drive the military out of power and bring back President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991. 
Aristide is now living in exile in Washington.

  [Text] On 22 May, we learned from reliable sources in 
Port-au-Prince that the Haitian Army was put on a maximum state 
of alert on 20 May, while the government of provisional 
President Emile Jonassaint, which is not recognized by the 
international community, has issued a severe warning to any 
persons having ties with the enemies of the fatherland or one of 
their agents. There were numerous members of the Armed Forces, 
including many in civilian clothing, bearing arms, circulating 
in the streets of Port-au-Prince on 22 May. 
  A communique issued by the Ministry of Information, Culture, 
and Coordination and signed by Jacques Saint-Louis reminds all 
that any person found to have had ties with the enemy with a 
view to making it easier for the enemy to enter the national 
territory, or to turning over military buildings, 
fortifications, fortresses, arsenals, ammunition depots, 
fortified towns, and harbors to the enemy will be sanctioned by 
hard labor for life. Anyone giving away their [not further 
identified] plans will be liable to the same sanction, the 
communique says, which does not specify the nature of the enemy. 
  The law will also punish anyone who attempts to shake the 
loyalty of officers, soldiers, and sailors toward the 
government. Any insulting words or threats uttered against an 
officer in command of a force charged with public order will be 
punished by one to six months' imprisonment. The communique adds 
that if the speaker is a member of the legislature, the sentence 
will be one to three years. 
  In case of crimes or offenses of inciting to rebellion 
through speeches or public documents, the agitator will be 
punished by an imprisonment of a minimum of six days and a 
maximum of one year, provided the rebellion did not take place. 
  Any fired civilian or military employee who continues to 
carry out his duties after he has been replaced will be punished 
by six months' to two years'imprisonment, adds the text. 
  The government of resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval is 
nevertheless the only one recognized by the international 
community. 
  The reminder of these sanctions comes in order to avoid any 
confusion detrimental to social peace, concludes the text. 
  This communique was issued 24 hours after the near-total 
embargo against Haiti went into effect in an attempt to force 
the military to resign.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (DPA) -- Fifty Haitians 
traveling on a boat to the United States were arrested by Haiian 
soldiers today. It is the first clear sign of the new plan 
backed by the military leadership to severely punish illegal 
immigration. 
  The frustrated refugees were arrested on a beach near Petit 
Goave, a small port city located some 60 km west of 
Port-au-Prince, two independent radio stations reported in the 
Haitian capital. 
  Emile Jonassaint, the provisional president appointed by the 
Haitian military leadership, following his installation in power 
two weeks ago, warned that he would punish anyone caught 
violating the island's laws, especially the law condemning those 
who leave the country without visas or proper documents. 
  Several analysts said the Army and other enemies of exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide hope to reduce the escape of 
Haitians to prevent the United States from deciding to use its 
military strength to resolve the political crisis in Haiti, 
which has lasted 30 months. 
  Preventing the entrance of Haitian refugees has been one of 
the primary objectives of U.S. policy since the bloody military 
coup that overthrew Aristide in 1991. 
  Since the coup more than 40,000 persons have fled Haiti in 
boats. Since President Bill Clinton announced two weeks ago that 
his country would give Haitians the possibility of requesting 
political asylum instead of returning them to the island, more 
than 1,200 persons have been caught at sea and sent back to the 
Caribbean nation.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- According to 
eyewitnesses, the bodies of four youths gunned down yesterday 
evening were found this morning in Cite Soleil, the largest 
low-income neighborhood in northern Port-au-Prince. 
  According to some residents, those murdered were followers 
of 
President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They reportedly were 
killed shortly before dawn by a group of unidentified armed men. 
  Since the toppling of President Aristide on 30 September 
1991, Cite Soleil has been the site of numerous acts of violence 
aimed at his followers. 
  It was also reported today that 278 "boat people" (fragile 
vessels packed with Haitian refugees) were intercepted on the 
high seas as they were trying to reach Florida. They were 
escorted back to Port-au-Prince by U.S. coast guard vessels. 
  Meanwhile, a Haitian business organization, the Center of 
Free Enteprise and Democracy (the equivalent of the young 
economic chambers), denounced today the "immorality" of UN a 
resolution reinstating a nearly full embargo against Haiti and 
the "inconstitutionality" of provisional President Emile 
Jonassaint and his government.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- Today, the OAS/UN 
delegation, in charge of supervising respect for human rights in 
Haiti, "very firmly" denounced the assassination of four 
political militants in Cite Soleil, Port-au-Prince's largest 
shantytown, on Sunday night. 
  In a communique, the delegation said Emmanuel Joseph, 38; 
Bontemps [name as received], 43; Delil Saint Louis, 26; and 
Serge Joseph, 19, were gunned down by "heavily armed civilians." 
The number of assassins has not been determined. 
  One victim was a member of the association Tete Ensemble 
Cite 
Soleil. Two belonged to the Association of Youths of Cite 
Soleil 8, and one was a member of the Alliance of Haitian 
Revolutionary Patriots and Democrats. 
  A fifth victim, also a member of a political party, and 
whose 
identity was not revealed, was wounded and left for dead. He 
received treatment later, the communique said. 
  At least six other people were wounded Sunday night in Cite 
Soleil. "Those executions seem to be a systematic elimination of 
members of popular organizations which favor a return to 
constitutional order," the communique concluded.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- The Front for 
Haiti's Advance and Progress [FRAPH], Haiti's leading 
neo-Duvalierist organization, today called on its militants to 
"mobilize" and resist with arms any attempt at invasion by the 
United States. 
  FRAPH Secretary General Emmanuel Constant said in a news 
conference: "In the event of a U.S. invasion, FRAPH would 
automatically become an `Armed Revolutionary Front' of the 
Haitian people." Constant, who condemned any attempt at an 
invasion, said his militants would fight an eventual enemy with 
"machetes, sticks, rocks, and so on." 
  The secretary general, who describes himself as "center 
rightist" rather than "far rightist, the group that includes 
wealthy, heartless people," asked the government of Emile 
Jonassaint, the new provisional but unrecognized president, to 
enforce "a true, undemagogic social justice." 
  Constant expressed his desire for administrative and 
judicial 
reforms, the Army's professionalization, the separation between 
the Army and the police, and "an urgent program to discipline 
the people to deal with the genocidal embargo." Constant 
pointed out that UN Security Council Resolution No. 917, which 
established a total embargo on the Haitian military government, 
demands the resignation of the police chief, Lieutenant Colonel 
Joseph Michel Francois. "The Governors Island agreement, and the 
parliamentarian plan to overcome the crisis as well, only 
provided for changes in the framework of the Army." 
  Referring to the international demand for the resignation of 
Haiti's entire general command, he wondered: "With whom are we 
going to negotiate Resolution No. 917. Let us be serious. 
Aristide (Jean Bertrand, the constitutional president in exile) 
cannot return (to Haiti), not because of the military, but 
rather because he has lost popularity in the presence of a 
powerful center rightist popular force," he concluded.

  [Text] Two Haitian private sector employers organizations 
have condemned the appointment of Judge Emile Jonassaint as 
president of the Republic. The two organizations -- the Haitian 
Manufacturer's Association, or ADIH, and the Center for Free 
Enterprise and Democracy -- have demanded that the Governors 
Island agreement and New York pact be implemented and respected. 
  ADIH's executive council officially rejects the appointment 
of Judge Jonassaint and his de facto government and, until 
President Aristide appoints a new prime minister, recognizes as 
a legitimate government only the resigning government headed by 
Robert Malval. 
  In a press release, ADIH's executive council urges the other 
sectors of the national life to take a stand to obtain a return 
to constitutionality immediately and without delay. 
  As for the Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy, which 
has denounced the unconstitutionality of the Jonassaint 
government, it also denounced -- and I quote -- the immorality 
of Security Council Resolution No. 917 and the discrimination 
and hypocrisy of U.S. policy toward the Haitian refugees. 
  This center, which reminds the Army that under the 
Constitution, it has the duty to protect lives and property, 
also urges President Aristide to immediately appoint a new prime 
minister. 
  Finally, this center asks all the protagonists in the 
crisis, 
both civilian and military, to exhibit public-spiritedness and 
patriotism so as to spare the nation the shame of a military 
intervention.

  [Text] The National Congress of Democratic Movements, 
Conacom, calls for solidarity among democrats for a return of 
constitutional order. In a communique, Conacom states that what 
is immediately necessary is the overthrow of the Jonassaint 
government; General Cedras' early retirement, respecting the 
signature he put to the Governors Island agreement; and the 
return of President Aristide as soon as possible. Among other 
strategic actions, Conacom suggests holding meetings between 
President Aristide and the representatives of democratic 
political organizations for the purpose of expediting the 
application of the Governors Island agreement; meetings between 
the sectors that signed the New York pact, for the purpose of 
studying the pact's clauses; and meetings between 
representatives of democratic political organizations and the 
nation's various social sectors with a view to obtaining these 
sectors' support for these initiatives. 
  Conacom firmly believes that applying those proposals 
courageously and without delay will allow us to spare the 
country a catastrophe, while guaranteeing a return to 
constitutional order, especially that of President Aristide, 
states this Conacom press release.

<F P=106> [Report by Yolanda Gonzalez, Emilio Lomas M., and Raul </F>
Llanos] 
  [Text] Hermosillo, Sonora, 29 May -- President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari said that even though signs of growth for the 
first quarter were modest, "there are enough elements for a 
reactivation of the country's economy." 
  Salinas said that although inflation reached only 8 percent 
last year, "this year we are working toward reducing it even 
more." During the 26th Ordinary General Assembly of the 
Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), the 
president called on the country's businessmen to look for new 
markets to compensate for the government's liberalization 
efforts. 
  "Our OECD membership can make us part of the most developed 
countries. It is not a way of saying that there are no longer 
shortages in our fatherland; on the contrary, it will help us 
acquire the tools to face the inequities and insufficiencies 
that our country still endures." 
  We have paved the way to compete at home and abroad, and you 
have shown that together we will do it successfully. After a 
two-day working tour, the president said that what has been 
accomplished so far is the result of efforts by all Mexicans. 
  "We are going to take advantage of the conditions that all 
Mexicans have created with so much hard work. We will keep 
inflation low to increase the likelihood of development and 
boost real salaries and the purchasing power of those who have 
the least. We will continue deregulation as an incentive for 
commercial and productive activities. We will curb 
bureaucratization and excessive red tape." 
  He added: "We will seek an opening that provides cheaper and 
more competitive raw materials and supplies for our production 
plants; an increased domestic market that favors consumers; 
diversified trade that, with effort, is converting Mexico into 
an exporting and competitive country; and a pluralistic nation 
that lives with tolerance, dialogue, and cooperation." 
  President Salinas de Gortari previously told the country's 
organized businessmen that their participation in the Stability, 
Competitiveness, and Employment Pact (PECE), together with the 
remaining social sectors and the government, "allowed inflation 
to reach only 8 percent last year. This year we will reduce it 
even more. We are confronting the inflation phenomena, which 
affected us the most and whose elimination was demanded the 
most, after having endured it for so many years." 
  The president said before Concanaco leaders and Commerce 
Secretary Jaime Serra Puche: "The essential element in 
consolidating the fight against inflation has been cleaning up 
public finances." He said this clean-up has allowed the country 
to eliminate the fiscal deficit and to use the savings realized 
from servicing a smaller debt to boost salaries and lower 
"certain" taxes. 
  "Remember that a few years ago the main burden was the 
country's excessive debt, and the only topic of discussion was 
how to eliminate it and overcome excessive inflation. Today, 
thanks to everyone's efforts, we have had truly encouraging 
results with both." 
  Salinas pointed out that Mexico's internal debt is only 10 
percent of GNP. "We have accomplished this with everyone's 
work, and it has also helped to eliminate excessive inflation, 
which so affected the workers' real wages." 
  President Salinas later said there are still problems, but 
there has also been progress which enables us to face new 
challenges and set higher goals. "This has been the result of 
our work, everyone's work. It is important to remember this, 
and it is also useful to take full advantage of it to benefit 
future generations." 
  President Salines said Mexicans needed economic stability to 
encourage investment and to reactivate the country's production. 
He said: Without price stability, it will be impossible to 
propose sustainable growth or to permanently direct our efforts 
toward justice. 
  "That is why we have been making changes that have allowed 
us 
to make our economy more productive and have established the 
conditions to create more jobs, which are the essential solution 
to the poverty problem and the possibility of becoming more 
competitive at the international level." 
  To conclude, he reasserted: "We confirmed the Mexican 
people's democratic will this year under complex circumstances. 
It is a determination to live in peace and create job 
opportunities. It is the principle of harmonious coexistence 
for everyone based on diversity and respect for all. It is a 
Mexico organized according to a civic spirit and love for the 
homeland."

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Llanos, Emilio Lomas M., and Yolanda </F>
Gonzalez from Hermosillo, Sonora State] 
  [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, secretary of commerce and 
industrial development [Secofi], admitted that despite the 
measures taken by the federal government to expedite credits for 
Mexican companies, interest rates remain high and are the main 
concern for small and intermediate businesses. 
  Serra maintains that the greater number of national banks 
and 
the opening of foreign credit institutions, which will accompany 
NAFTA, will create more competition and allow the country to 
receive new resources that will increase the money supply. 
"Both circumstances," he predicted, "will put downward pressure 
on interest rates." 
  In his speech before the 76th General Assembly of the 
Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), the 
Secofi secretary said the foreign trade indicators for the first 
quarter of this year "are very positive" and added that for the 
January-March period, total exports increased approximately 17 
percent compared to the same period in 1993. 
  In addition, Serra reported that the sale of manufactured 
products abroad was the sector with the most dynamic growth. 
This sector grew nearly 26 percent, particularly exports of 
cotton fabrics and other vegetal fibers as well as plastic 
products and automobiles. 
  Serra explained that according to statistics compiled in the 
United States, Mexican exports to that country increased 22 
percent in the first two months of the year, a figure double the 
increase registered by exports from the rest of the world. 
  In a speech given before President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, 
Serra also declared that the type of imports to the country 
demonstrate the technological modernization and competitiveness 
of the national economy, adding that intermediate goods 
accounted for 71 percent of imports, capital goods for 17 
percent, and final consumption products for 12 percent. Such 
results of the commercial balance, Serra continued, show the 
benefits of NAFTA and the growing competitiveness of the 
country's economy. 
  Regarding financing, the secretary spoke of an increase of 
over 4 billion new pesos in credit lines from the National Bank 
of Internal Trade (BNCI) in 1994, representing a 60-percent 
increase over last year. Of this amount, nearly 30 percent is 
destined for the creation of infrastructure and 44 percent for 
small and intermediate businesses. 
  Regarding development banking, the Commercial Development 
Fund (Fidec) tripled its financing from 1990 to 1993 with its 
credit supply going from 1 billion to 3.2 billion new pesos, 
Serra remarked. 
  Serra said financing resulted in the construction of 463,000 
square meters of storage and cold storage facilities, while 
Fidec is expected to increase its credits for businesses' 
working capital this year by 81 percent, and for those destined 
for building commercial centers by 166 percent. 
  Serra also said emphasis has been placed on promoting new 
forms of business associations to improve the scale of operation 
by organizing purchasing credit and integrating business groups. 
  Regarding legal changes, Serra noted that between 1989 and 
1993, the number of credit unions that can operate in any sector 
of the economy, issue bonds, and trade assets grew by 22 percent 
annually. Consequently, the secretary of Secofi concluded, 
these new forms of association can resolve businessmen's credit 
problems, problems of joint negotiations with purveyors, and 
problems searching for markets and forming associations with 
foreign businessmen.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 19 May -- Federal Judicial 
Police [PJF] units seized 607 kg of marijuana and detained a 
band of drug traffickers formed by members of the Municipal 
Directorate of Public Security and Transportation. 
  Roberto Villalta, who was wearing his work uniform, Gerardo 
Calderon, Patricio Esparza, and another unidentified person were 
taken into custody in the operation. 
  Residents of Bolivia Street, El Barreal neighborhood, 
reported seeing policemen and Public Security and Transportation 
vehicles constantly arriving at a warehouse where the PJF later 
seized the marijuana. The PJF said it seized 606.84 kg of 
cannabis and two scales used to package the drug. 
  The officers who participated in the operation also 
confiscated a black Chevrolet van with gray stripes bearing 
Texas license plates and a red Pontiac Grand Am with Colorado 
plates. 
  The police said they will continue their investigations and 
hope to make several arrests in connection with the bust. 
  In a related story, the Attorney General's office destroyed 
two plantations in Sinaloa and Baja California estimated to 
cover 20,000 square meters. The plantations, located during 
several reconnaissance flights, were believed to hold 210,000 
marijuana plants. 
  The first plantation was discovered in a ranching area known 
as Las Playitas, Sinaloa de Leyva Municipality. Several PJF 
units converged on the area and destroyed marijuana plants and 
heroin poppies growing on 3.5 square meters. 
  Meanwhile, a 15 square-meter marijuana plantation was found 
and destroyed near Rewal del Castillo Viejo and Enecua along the 
Ojos Negros Highway, Encenada, Baja California. 
  Police found three pickaxes, two shovels, two hoes, four 
machetes, an axe, a container of gasoline, two 22-caliber 
rifles, one 30-30 caliber and six 7.62-caliber cartridges, a 
7.62 caliber clip, and a Chevrolet Blazer with California plates.

  [Text] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma has invited the 
Army to cooperate in building a national defense state policy. 
  He extended this invitation during a ceremony at which 
President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle decorated four high-ranking 
Army officers. 
  The chief of state awarded the President of the Republic 
medal to Brigadier Generals Rofolfo Sanchez, Juan Cheyre, Hernan 
Reyes, and Manuel Vitis. 
  The defense minister then addressed the event. He stated 
that 
nobody in the past few years has the moral superiority to judge 
the various governments of the past three decades. He said that 
the time has come to positively fill the gap that separates 
politicians from military men by building a state national 
defense policy. 
  [Begin Perez recording] The times of impositions are long 
gone. We do not believe in a formal subordination based on the 
authority of whoever signs a decree. We believe the 
subordination of military men to the political authority is the 
way a democratic society keeps a legitimate space to implement a 
military policy with full respect for the Constitution. [end 
recording] 
  President Frei earlier opened a seminar which dealt with 
emerging enterprises and the society of the future. He said the 
strategy of his government's productive modernization plan is to 
improve national enterprises, enhancing their international 
competitiveness. 
  Today President Frei met with Army Commander General Augusto 
Pinochet Ugarte who informed him of a trip abroad he will make 
soon.

  [Text] General Rodolfo Stange travelled to the northern 
region of the country this afternoon. He delegated his duties to 
Carabineros Deputy Director General Fernando Cordero. Having 
arrived in Iquique this evening, Gen. Stange asserted that his 
relations with the government are normal. 
  Gen. Stange travelled to Iquique accompanied by his wife and 
retinue aboard a commercial flight. The defense minister had 
previously issued a brief communique stating that before 
leaving, Gen. Stange had officially delegated to the Carabineros 
deputy director general, General Fernando Cordero, all the power 
and duties that the Carabineros Organizational Law permits him. 
Following his arrival in Iquique this evening, Gen. Stange said 
that the issue of the command was not under discussion. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Stange] I have not handed over command. 
It 
is one thing to delegate some normal duties, but quite another 
to delegate command. The command of the Carabineros is vested in 
the director general. 
  [Unidentified reporter] General Stange, how are your 
relations with the president of the Republic at present? 
  [Stange] Well, normal. Here there is no...[changes thought] 
There is no reason why they should have changed. 
  [Reporter] What is your assessment of the problematic 
situation you have had to face? 
  [Stange] In what sense problematic? 
  [Reporter] In the sense that you had to be on leave for a 
considerable period of time. 
  [Stange] Well, yes, I was on vacation. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] how do you evaluate the case 
of 
the murder of the three Communist leaders? 
  [Stange] That is another subject about which I am not going 
to comment; you are asking me questions I cannot answer, as this 
involves a lawsuit which is at another stage. [end recording] 
  Gen. Stange will stay in the northern region for 
approximately two weeks inspecting various Carabineros units. 
The trip is being made within the framework of a study he is 
doing to draft a plan to streamline the institution, a task 
entrusted to him by the defense minister.

  [Text] In the final stretch of the election for a new 
president, the opinion polls are at their highest. The most 
likely candidates go up and down in the polls these days. The 
differences between them are minimal. Technically, there is a 
tie between Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana. 
  This station's opinion poll caused a surprise because it is 
the only one of five in which Pastrana is ahead of Samper. 
According to the poll, the conservative candidate has 47 percent 
of the vote while the liberal candidate has 42 percent. Today's 
poll is to be added to those of a few days ago, which report 
more and more contradictory results. On Thursday the National 
Consultation Center reported that Samper led Pastrana with 47 
percent of the vote and that Pastrana had 40 percent of the vote. 
  EL TIEMPO yesterday reported to the National Consultation 
Center another poll, according to which Samper leads Pastrana by 
five points. EL ESPECTADOR, based on a Napoleon Franco poll, 
today put Pastrana at 38 percent and Samper at 43 percent. EL 
ESPECTADOR also reports that Antonio Navarro has progressed to 8 
percent and Miguel Maza to 4 percent. 
  During this up and down movement in the polls, which had not 
occurred in previous campaigns, the only truly clear fact is 
that no one has 50 percent of the vote. In other words, the only 
clear fact so far is that there will be a runoff election.

<F P=106> [Article by Juan de la Fuente Mejia, economist and expert on </F>
violence in the Huallaga Valley: "It Is Still Night in Huallaga" 
-- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] This article is part of a study that the Council of 
Projects for Latin American Refugees (CPRL) conducted between 
October and December of last year on forced relocations in the 
Upper Huallaga and Huanuco. It has observed from the Upper 
Huallaga that Shining Path (SL), far from being annihilated, is 
relocating to the provinces of Huanuco and Ucayali and to the 
Central Jungle. Since January, there have been several news 
reports of another relocation into the provinces of San Martin 
in the Mayo River Basin. Attacks on towns, executions of mayors 
and teachers, bloody ambushes, the shutdown of Huanuco 
university, and a great many disappearances tell us that the 
post-Shining Path era is a long way off there. 
  Several small children are playing war at six in the evening 
on a street in now deserted Uchiza. Most want to be the "firma" 
(the cocaine mafia); others want to be "cumpas" (Shining Path) 
or "colochos" (Colombians). The littlest one complains that he 
does not want to be the "moroco" or army, but he has to if he 
wants to play. 
  It seems that Abimael Guzman is playing a very weak hand in 
the Upper Huallaga and in the Department of Huanuco, but at the 
same time there are few signs that Shining Path is vanishing. At 
worst, a respite would diminish uncertainties. This would 
presumably be the last great Shining Path battlefront, where the 
ultimate outcome of this 14-year-old war would be played out. 
  The regional committee in the Upper Huallaga was never just 
another committee. Its establishment was a victory for the 
so-called "black line," spearheaded by Osman Morote, that 
opposed Abimael Guzman. Guzman did not want SL to move into an 
area that he regarded as a "rotten territory" which could easily 
contaminate his cadres and would be taken over only after SL 
controlled much of the country. At the Central Committee plenum 
that debated the issue, Guzman reportedly said that "the Indians 
will never understand Gonzalo's thoughts." The internal 
opposition retorted that this is what the "five golden rules" 
were for and that the party should not throw away the 
opportunities offered by the jungle. 
  This is why its existence was always a challenge to 
"Chairman 
Gonzalo's" authority and one of the reasons, aside from the 
historical ones, why it did not become the Main Regional 
Committee. 
  The valley had its advantages. It was the area with the 
fastest growth, the territory in which SL conducted its 
principal experiments. The first "armed work stoppages" were 
decreed there, later to be conducted nationwide. The forms of 
organization for the "liberated zones" spread throughout its 
vast expanses between 1987 and 1990. SL did not even dream of 
trying these forms, which were developed according to theory and 
corrected in practice (such as the town delegates and the open 
grassroots committees), in Lima and other cities. 
  It was General Arciniega who altered the course of the war 
in 
the Huallaga Valley. He radically changed the strategy followed 
until then, which regarded SL, drug traffickers, and the 
peasants who grew coca leaves as a single military target, and 
he vied with SL for peasant grassroots support; he stopped 
cracking down on coca growing and tried to restore the people's 
trust in the military through assistance efforts. 
  These were not the only changes. When Arciniega assumed 
command of the Huallaga Front in 1989 after SL's bloody takeover 
of Uchiza, he shifted the center of operations from the north 
(Tarapoto, Juanjui, and the Mayo River) to the south, to the 
provinces of Mariscal Caceres (San Martin) and Leoncio Prado 
(Huanuco) in the Upper Huallaga. 
  His successors, Generals Chacon, Brito, and Hanke, moved the 
hub of operations back to its former location and made the 
crackdown on the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] a 
priority. The upshot was a stronger SL that expanded into the 
province of Padre Abad (Ucayali), which borders the Huallaga. 
  In 1993, when it was certain that the MRTA had been broken 
up, the Huallaga Front moved its center of operations southward 
for the second time, whereupon it became obvious that SL was 
feeling the blows and starting to withdraw in several directions. 
  Its first move was towards the interior. Resigned to the 
fact 
that the blows to its "territorial networks" would be crushing, 
SL chose to shift its "mobile networks," that is, the units of 
the People's Guerrilla Army (EGP), into the jungle. 
  The other two moves have not represented much of an exodus, 
being more a combination of withdrawal and deployment. On the 
one hand, it has moved into the other provinces in the 
Department of Huanuco and, from there, via corridors, to La 
Libertad and Ancash; on the other, it has moved into the central 
jungle through Puerto Inca, Puerto Bermudez, and Codo del Pozuzo. 
  There were several reasons for this initial movement. First, 
the coca market crash has made the civilian population and the 
growers less dependent on SL. The chain reaction from this 
crisis pushed many of the social and economic players who had 
previously sought SL's help out of the area and left it with a 
smaller civilian population to vie for. Local observers note 
that paradoxically it would seem to be coca, rather than the 
army, that is getting the best of Shining Path. 
  The countryside is becoming depopulated through emigration. 
Most of the families that were lured by the coca boom to the 
valley from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin, and Ucayali in the 1970's and 
1980's are going home. 
  Second, the aforementioned southward shift of the center of 
military operations is putting pressure on SL and forcing it to 
relocate further away from towns. 
  Third, the Armed Forces are following a somewhat different 
strategy vis-a-vis the civilian population: less of a presence 
in cities and medium-sized towns (Tingo Maria, Aucayacu, 
Tocache, and Uchiza) and a stronger role in rural areas and 
smaller towns, including civic action programs. 
  The role that the patrols played in defeating SL in the 
central highlands is not the same as in the Upper Huallaga. They 
are not very widespread there, and the army is having serious 
trouble organizing them. In the central highlands the patrols 
were formed using the structure of the peasant communities, 
which had to defend territory, internal democracy, and crops, 
among other things. 
  There are very few communities in the Huallaga, but another 
factor is even more significant: migration has made the area 
cosmopolitan, and owing to this development, combined with the 
weak sense of order and democracy and the coca market crash, the 
locals are uninterested in defending what they really do not 
possess or have ceased to possess. 
<H5>  Yankee Go Home </H5>
  The old red graffiti can still be seen along the road from 
Tingo Maria to Tocache. They are from 1989-90: "Long live the 
MLM," "Yankee Go Home," "Long Live Chairman Gonzalo," "Finish 
Off the Great Leap With a Gold Seal." None refers to "defending 
the life of Chairman Gonzalo" or some other current issue. 
Shining Path is not writing graffiti anymore today, nor is it 
operating checkpoints along roads, nor does it control the 
small, remote coca-growing towns. Its favorite tactics are 
ambushes, executions, and a few raids into small towns. During 
the first 10 months of 1993 its ambushes alone took the lives of 
24 army personnel. 
  It would be a mistake to conclude that SL does not retain 
some of its military reserves. The "main force," which the army 
itself estimated at 3,000 men, plus the "local forces" and the 
"base forces," totaled more than 6,000 men in 1989. Estimates 
are that these forces have declined by 80 percent over the last 
two years as a result of arrests, battles, desertions, and 
surrenders of reformed SL members. This means that SL would 
currently be able to mobilize 1,200 men, still a potent force. 
<H5>  Huanuco: Leave or Die </H5>
  There are no graffiti, either new or old, in Huanuco, except 
for a few at the university. The SL's do not seem to do that 
kind of thing there. But a great many people have been killed. 
Four university professors, two students, and the woman 
president of the mothers clubs have been slain in less than one 
year. A student and a leader of the SUTEP [Trade Union of 
Education Workers] were severely wounded. SL does allow itself 
certain luxuries there, such as its ambush of a patrol car in 
the downtown section of the city last September. 
  Since the SL regional committee in the Upper Huallaga 
decided 
in early 1992 to no longer consider Huanuco a transit point and 
temporary haven, the search for new "support bases" in the once 
placid city has turned violent. 
  Gonzalo's "red line" was in the majority until September of 
last year; its goal was to clear out the political scene until 
only it and the State remained as adversaries. This faction was 
presumably responsible for the attacks of recent years and 
executed about one well-known public figure a month. The capture 
of an SL commando group in the city of Huanuco last August was 
reportedly a severe blow to the Gonzalo faction, leaving it in 
the minority. 
  The other faction seeks to focus on government 
representatives. Its main goal is to pursue the tactics of the 
war of national liberation, which characterizes the faction of 
Osman Morote or the "former opposition" in the area. 
  Hermilio Valdizan University is reportedly the center of SL 
activity. Its objective seems to be to recruit and train cadres, 
using the university as a springboard for subsequent development 
in the slums. Whoever opposes this approach has two options: 
leave or die. Ten professors have left in response to threats, 
among them the former president of the region, Andres Avelino 
Caceres, and the dean of the Department of Administrative 
Sciences, Julio Tarazona Padilla, as well as the former 
president of the teachers union, Ruben Sachun, and the former 
president of the Women's Network, Denessy Palacios, among others. 
  Recent raids into the towns of Tantamayo and Monzon in 
September suggest that SL has again occupied the northern 
corridor of the Huanuco highlands, which it used from 1983 to 
1988, its years of expansion. Supporting this deduction is the 
fact that the column which attacked Monzon (40 to 50 men in poor 
shape, with neither food nor clothing, with few supplies, many 
of them suffering from leishmaniasis) is the same one that 
raided Tantamayo. 
  This corridor extends into the Department of Ancash and 
presumably enables SL to help out its organizations in Huaraz 
and northern Peru, to remove its wounded, and to obtain 
supplies. In addition, it is probably using the corridor that 
runs from Uchiza through Tayobamba and Huacrachuco to La 
Libertad. 
<H5>  Ayacucho, Again and Again </H5>
  Manuel Milla Pinzas, a former dean of the Bar Association 
and 
university professor, was killed by an SL commando group at the 
gate to the university campus at five in the afternoon last 4 
October. One hundred meters away is the Cayhuayna police 
checkpoint, where there were more than 20 agents and one van. 
The commando group fled on foot towards Paucarbamba and vanished 
from sight 10 minutes later. Rosa del Aguila, the president of 
the Federation of Mothers Clubs, was slain two months before 
near Calicanto Bridge. She called for help and fought with her 
assailants, who left on foot, watched by two policemen standing 
guard at the gate to the headquarters of the Technical 
Police...less than 100 meters from the scene of the crime. 
Ayacucho 1980? Lima 1992? No. Huanuco in recent months. 
  Several mistakes in the strategy to combat subversion could 
have negative repercussions in the short term. In fact, they 
already have. Residents of the city are obviously jumpy, and the 
exodus of people could be followed by a withdrawal of the 
investments that have been trickling in for the past two years. 
  The military commands have allowed SL to start retreating 
into the provinces in the Huanuco highlands and into the city 
itself and to use the Huamalies and Huacrachuco corridors 
without much difficulty. 
  The Achilles' heel of the battle against subversion is the 
civilian population. In light of the difficulties it has had in 
organizing the patrols, the military command is resorting to 
territorial control, assistance, then neglect, and so on. But it 
does not stop at exclusion; it also cracks down. It would seem 
that beyond the sweeps, the mass control of the disadvantaged 
population, and whatever arrests it may make, the army has 
little to fall back on. 
  Over the past two years Huanuco has been the department with 
the most arrests and missing persons. The Human Rights 
Commission of the Constitutional Congress reported recently that 
in 1992 there were 144 disappearances, 132 of which are blamed 
on the army. 
  In 1993 there were 89 complaints filed, 32 in relation to 
army actions. From January to August of last year alone, the 
Ombudsman's Unit of the Attorney General's Office documented 38 
missing person reports, most of them implicating troops from 
"Los Laureles" barracks in Tingo Maria. The problems are 
mounting because neither Tingo Maria nor Huanuco has a human 
rights commission. 
  Other key words for the Upper Huallaga and Huanuco that 
neither the government nor the military seem to understand are 
"development" and "social support." In a region in which the 
State has been clueless for the past 15 years and in which the 
absence of democracy is as obvious as the lack of jobs, markets, 
investment, education, and health care, the mildest 
antigovernment rhetoric will clearly work. 
  The strategy to combat subversion should take into account 
that the clearer the decline in the SL threat becomes, the more 
the State will again be the main target of discontent. A long 
list of problems persists in the Huanuco jungle and highlands: 
towns without electric power, communities in which 80 percent of 
the children suffer from leishmaniasis, villages without 
schools, harvests that cannot be taken to market because there 
are no roads, crops attacked by pests and blights, producers who 
cannot get loans, growers who want aid to replace their coca 
crops, people without jobs, displaced persons without homes, 
work, or hope. The National Compensation and Social Development 
Fund is not enough. What is needed is public and private 
investment, credit, an expansion of the agricultural frontier, 
and the promotion of output and jobs. 
  Expanded assistance is oh so far away from the Huallaga and 
Huanuco! 
<H5>  [Box, p 41] </H5>
<H5>  The Guerrillas Wear Blue Jeans </H5>
  The members of Shining Path in the Upper Huallaga are more 
cosmopolitan and frivolous and less ideological. Unlike the 
militant Maoists from Ayacucho, the SL people in the Huallaga 
have little political and ideological motivation. 
  We should bear in mind that the area does not have a 
tradition of political confrontation (which Ayacucho does), nor 
is there a deeply rooted political culture, nor are there elites 
or parties that are even halfway organized. So, during SL's peak 
years you could see militiamen and activists wearing blue jeans, 
Hush Puppies shoes, and University of Oklahoma sweatshirts, 
something that would have been unlikely in other areas, even the 
hot ones. 
  SL has gained little from its 10 years in the valley. Unlike 
in the highlands and the Andes, it built its relations with the 
people in the Huallaga Valley on the defense of coca growing, 
not on the assertion of any ideology. 
  This link is becoming weaker and weaker, because there are 
fewer coca crops and less drug trafficking, which will likely 
wind up being insignificant. The reason for its success will 
eventually turn out to be the reason for its failure. In the 
long run, the coca growers and gangland kingpins will wind up 
using Gonzalo's men. Perhaps this is why Abimael Guzman, who is 
not much of a populist, opposed the opening of this front, 
inasmuch as a future alliance with Huallaga society did not 
depend on his forces. 
  But what is easily conquered is easily lost as well. None of 
the mass organization arrangements that SL developed is working 
today: neither the grassroots committees nor the militias nor 
the groups they created. In a place where it was very easy to 
move from being a small-time trafficker to a militiaman or from 
being a coca grower (or else a producer of cocaine paste) to a 
delegate, it is also very simple to return to one's former 
activity, or to emigrate. 
  These factors are also affecting SL. Most of its members no 
longer want to be involved in the war. They are fleeing, 
preferring not to become reformed terrorists. Some come to Lima, 
others to Pucallpa and from there to Brazil, to Manaus or 
Cruzeiro, where SL's, MRTA members, grassroots leaders, and 
peasants accused of terrorism have gathered to live. The more 
than 100 members who turned themselves in in January were 
probably not commanders or activists; they were likely residents 
of the former support bases, militiamen, or collaborators with 
the organizations they created. 
  SL is presumably trying to follow the coca route or move 
alongside it. This is the reason for the attack on the 
Ashaninkas, which was probably an attempt to clean out the area. 
Everyone knows that coca is moving east and south, from Puerto 
Inca to the central jungle. The Codo del Pozuzo, which was once 
a ranching paradise, is part of the new scene of the coca-SL-war 
symbiosis. In the jungle SL is fated to wander around after the 
coca growers and drug traffickers from valley to valley, no 
longer as a political and military force that aspires to take 
over the country but as part of an apparatus that protects the 
former from the State. 
<H5>  [Box, p 32] </H5>
<H5>  The Long Tocache March </H5>
  Driven by the need for territorial domination, Shining Path 
structured the life of the drug traffickers and each of their 
"firms." It did so as only it knows how. One fine day it issued 
a decree, the most noteworthy points in which were: 
  a. Cocaine is for overseas consumption, and domestic use is 
punished. The watchword was: "The spider does not consume its 
own poison." 
  b. Defend the right to plant coca shrubs and to work and 
prevent the eradication projects from destroying the crops. The 
watchword: "Yankee Go Home." 
  c. The "firms" could not have more than four foreigners. The 
purpose of this was to stem the invasion of Colombians and stave 
off their violent activities. They stated that Colombian men 
married to Peruvian women would be given preference in remaining 
here. 
  d. The "traqueteros" (the people who drove through towns and 
along roads on motorcycles buying the packages of cocaine paste) 
had to be Peruvian. 
  e. All sales and "flights" (shipments of cocaine paste to 
Colombia) had to be carried out in the presence of the SL 
delegate. The slogan: "The Party has a thousand eyes and a 
thousand ears." 
  Many people's disbelief was dispelled when, two weeks after 
SL issued its "edict," it dragged four Colombians out of the 
"Porkis" discotheque in Uchiza and slit their throats. 
  SL's first advance guards arrived in the valley seeking jobs 
as coca harvesting laborers, the lowest rung on the coca ladder. 
During the first stage, from 1983 to late 1984, Shining Path 
focused on emphasizing its message to the people (the tactic of 
developing bases). In July 1984 an emergency was declared in the 
zone, and the military crackdown forced SL to retreat. The 
military campaign, which did not distinguish between targets, 
helped to bolster its ties with the civilian population. SL did 
not waste the opportunity and took charge of administering 
justice and daily life in the mid-sized towns that were 
flourishing because of coca and coca-dollars. It dealt with 
marital conflicts and land disputes and enforced penalties for 
minor offenses. Theirs was not a public takeover but rather a 
surreptitious presence in civil society, a silent alliance in 
which at that time SL was the major beneficiary. 
  The second stage, from 1987 to 1991, was marked by SL's 
intensive and extensive deployment. During it SL scored its 
biggest successes. It dealt head-on blows to the State and 
easily took over towns, causing the police to flee from many 
spots, never to return; it set up checkpoints on roads and 
charged tolls to enter certain towns. 
  SL was able to move in rapidly because its advance guards 
were not the first to shatter law and order in the Upper 
Huallaga. When they arrived, people in the Peruvian jungle did 
not ask who was armed but instead who was not. 
  The local "mafias" had been armed since the mid-1970's, 
first 
to defend themselves against gangs of assailants and later to 
enforce the law of silence by assassinating mayors, governors, 
and newsmen. When Gonzalo's hosts arrived, many of the towns 
scattered about the valley had no authorities, and the locals 
lived in fear of abuses by the "mafias." 
  The jungle needed its own brand of law and order, and SL was 
the right policeman for the job. "Coca" and "cocaine," not 
"eradication," enjoyed the broadest consensus in the zone. In 
keeping with the classic literary theme, SL sold its soul 
(ideology) for life (territory). The key word in this alliance 
was not "socialism," "equality," or "revolution," but rather 
"protection." It was the only SL front in which ideology did not 
come first and foremost. 
  SL gained nothing other than the physical territory that it 
controlled and the social oversight that it exercised. It could 
never command the economy, and the only time that it tried to, 
in 1988 when it decreed a strike in Uchiza and outlawed the coca 
harvest and the sale of cocaine paste, it met with defeat when 
the coca market shifted to the Lower Huallaga and the peasants 
rioted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo McBride, president of Exporters </F>
Association, by Manuel Castillo Ochoa; place and date not given: 
"We Need a Different Economic Program"; first paragraph is 
QUEHACER introduction] 
  [Text] Adjustment fatigue seems to have hit high levels. 
The dollar is still low and exports have not taken off. In 
discussing this difficult issue and other related matters, the 
president of ADEX [Exporters Association], Eduardo McBride, 
calls for a change--going from a monetary peg to an exchange 
peg; says there will be an initial cost--a rise in inflation; 
and calls for economic consensus, the basis for political 
consensus. His controversial statements follow. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] Unlike the flight of capital from Latin 
America in past years, we have recently seen an influx of 
capital from abroad--much of it short term, or "rolling stone" 
capital, including in our case the repatriation of Peruvian 
capital. This has kept the dollar low and prolonged the exchange 
arrears. This tends to favor imports at the expense of exports. 
What should be done to turn these trends around? 
  [McBride] One consequence of a structural adjustment, 
anywhere in the world, is that in the first phase there is a 
combination of exchange arrears and high interest rates. 
  These two elements are very directly related. So we need to 
attack the exchange rate directly or attack the interest rate 
indirectly. Obviously, that cannot be done in the short term. 
But since this process began in August 1990 and so far has had 
no positive consequences, we believe that both phenomena--the 
rise in interest rates and the exchange rate arrears--have had 
too high a cost for the adjustment process. We think this could 
have been done very early--during the program's first phase, and 
even up to December 1993. 
  Now we have reached the conclusion that if we continue to 
maintain the same economic policy we are not going to achieve 
greater progress with either the interest rate or the exchange 
rate. 
  We know there are factors affecting the exchange rate, like 
"rolling stone" capital. Much of that capital, about $250 
million a month, comes from Peruvian businessmen who started to 
return in 1990, either to strengthen their companies, improve 
their technology, or simply to maintain some level of activity 
and avert bankruptcy. I personally believe a third of that 
capital is coming in for speculative purposes. 
  We have heard of Peruvian promoters and bankers who have 
encouraged the influx of all this capital from abroad, most of 
which--I believe, though I can not give you a percentage--is 
Peruvian capital. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] We can understand the reasons for this 
influx of foreign capital and repatriation of Peruvian capital: 
economic liberalization, reduction in the price of the dollar, 
interest rates higher than international averages, etc. But it 
is detrimental to exports. How do you exporters see the solution? 
  [McBride] We know the economic program has helped us with 
the 
readjustment. Inflation has been reduced, and we even had some 
growth in 1993, though more for temporary than structural 
reasons, I believe. So it has had some good points. 
  But if our primary goal is the nation's development, and 
secondly, for exports to be the fundamental factor driving this 
development, then we need another economic program. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] And what might that be? 
  [McBride] That economic program has two key elements. The 
first is to change the monetary peg which we have had until now, 
which affects the Central Reserve Bank's monetary policy. 
  By reducing the money supply and applying strict fiscal 
discipline, expressed in a national government budget, 
satisfactory results have been achieved in fighting inflation. 
But that is not an essential factor now. We need a peg linked to 
the dollar. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] Going from a monetary to an exchange peg? 
  [McBride] Right. But it cannot be done overnight. And here 
is 
the second aspect. As nobody has a magic wand and can say 
exactly what is going to be done, we have to sit down to talk 
during the first six months of 1994. People from professional 
associations, from the universities, from technical economic 
institutions, associations involved in exports, people in the 
government. Sit down to think about how the exchange policy can 
be modified, since there are certain commitments from which we 
cannot be released--with the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund--and they will affect our decisions. 
  We have to talk about how far we can change specific 
elements, in a gradual way, so the export sector will really 
provide the basis for economic development. Not because I say 
so, but because that is what the government itself is proposing 
now. 
  What bothers me most is that the people running the 
government, the government leaders, talk a lot about exports as 
the nation's factor for development, while in practice they work 
against the companies involved in exports. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] But will going from a monetary peg to an 
exchange peg cause inflation to heat up once again?? 
  [McBride] Yes, in the first phase it would have a cost. I 
will not deny that. There was an initial cost in 1990 when the 
monetary peg was created, when we moved from 300 percent peak 
inflation in one month. 
  But then the great opportunity for an exchange peg was lost. 
Well, there is no point in bemoaning that. Doing so now would 
have an initial cost, of course: a rise in inflation. But I 
think that can be absorbed. What we propose is to bring 
everybody together so that cost, which is going to come about in 
any event, will ultimately produce collective 
benefits. 
  I believe that factor, that search for dialogue, the appeal 
to all the technical people, might be a starting point for an 
economic consensus that can later be transformed into a 
political consensus. There is no political consensus unless 
there is first an economic consensus. That is essential. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] That sounds very good. But specifically, 
now 
that we have touched on that issue, one thing concerns me. You 
are talking about a national political consensus, an economic 
consensus. But some sectors have the impression that Peruvian 
businessmen are not investing because they do not want to. A 
little while ago the historian Pablo Macera said that. And 
President Fujimori repeated it. Is it true that they are not 
investing? There is great uncertainty about business behavior, 
which would make any consensus difficult. 
  [McBride] I am going to quote something said by Juan Antonio 
Aguirre of CONFIEP [National Confederation of Private Business]: 
"The business community today is in a state of ferment." He said 
that in the sense of innovative dynamism. It is not only 
investing what it has, but what it does not have. As a 
consequence of the structural adjustment, the business community 
has lost a great deal of its assets. The export sector, at 
least, has lost its credit capacity. We are no longer very 
profitable for banks. The export business is not very 
profitable. The Office of the Superintendent of Banks now 
demands very strict loan guarantees. We constantly have fewer 
loan guarantees to offer to the banking system to be able to 
recover our credit. But even with that deterioration, we are 
making use of the opportunities and the knowhow we have. 
  I could give you many examples, like the investments in 
asparagus, the interest of foreign investors in the quality of 
our skills and the qualifications of our labor, unlike other 
regions such as Africa, which are suitable for growing 
asparagus, but where they lack the technical skills and labor 
capacity that we have in Peru. 
  The conditions are right in Peru, and we Peruvians are 
investing. I myself am investing in land in San Lorenzo for 
mango exports. In the past we bought all our mangos from farmers 
and processed them. Now we are entering a new phase and I think 
that just as we are investing in agricultural exports, a great 
deal is also being invested in other fields (textiles, metal, 
and mechanical products). 
  [Castillo Ochoa] President Fujimori spoke of both foreign 
and 
Peruvian investors and compared them, calling upon national 
investors to follow the lead of foreign investors. 
  [McBride] Foreign investors have a great public image. They 
are talked about a lot, but we Peruvians invest every day to 
keep business going. We put our money where our mouth is, as the 
saying goes. A large part of the capital influx from abroad is 
from Peruvians who are investing, reconverting, keeping their 
businesses going, and that is also investment. 
  Let us not disparage ourselves. Nobody talks about us in the 
newspapers. But we invest every day. When we buy Peruvian 
products, we are investing. When we process products, we are 
investing. When we sign a contract for a new unit, we are 
investing, not just in machinery but also in new jobs. That is 
not reported in the newspapers, it is not added in, no records 
are kept, nor is there an economic unit or office in Peru that 
keeps track of this activity. 
  When we train our employees and send them to take courses at 
ESAN [School of Business Administration], at IPAE [Peruvian 
Institute of Business Administration], or at CEADEX [expansion 
not given], who knows about that? Nobody. Foreign companies have 
an image, they make more noise; then they sell. They invest 200 
million in five years. We invest 200 million in a single year. 
That is the truth. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] There is an idea that businessmen have been 
receiving the benefits of a number of different economic 
incentives. You had been receiving the Certex [Export 
Certificates]. Now you want a "draw back." 
  [McBride] We are trying to get a tax rebate now. That is 
clear and specific. Why? For a principle that is generally 
accepted all over the world: that taxes are not exported. That 
prevails in Chile, Colombia, the United States, Europe, and 
Japan. 
  As we pay a single direct tax, we are at a disadvantage in 
relation to this general principle of market competition. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] The government says that its model treats 
all economic agents the same, that no agent should have 
prerogatives over another. They should compete efficiently and 
let the market decide. 
  [McBride] That is not entirely true. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] Why? 
  [McBride] Because, for example, in tax legislation people 
who 
invest in tourism are exempt from the minimum income tax. 
However, at this time it would cost us exporters 2 percent, 
unless we are buying new machinery. In that case, we could 
deduct something. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] There is not equal treatment for all 
economic agents? 
  [McBride] Until 31 December there seemed to be equal 
treatment. But now we have learned that until that date 
reinvestments in the mining sector were completely tax-free. The 
industrial sector did not have those incentives, nor did the 
fishing or service sectors. And now they have been eliminated 
for mining. 
  I think that in terms of promotion, incentives, leadership, 
orientation, there is instability and total confusion. We know 
this. 
  We, as industrialists and service exporters, are not 
interested in hurting mining reinvestments. I am not going to 
say: listen, why give that to him and not to me? But on 31 
December the mining industry was also stripped of its 
incentives. That seems ridiculous to me. Now they are not giving 
incentives to mining, to industry, to fishing, to services, or 
to anyone. There is really no organization. 
  Still, tax legislation to stimulate tourism has come out. 
That seems welcome and excellent to me. And the tax on 
unimproved land was removed, and some other advantages were 
devised for the construction sector. That seems good to me. 
  It seems good that there is movement in the direction of 
saying: this year we are going to develop our economy, starting 
with construction and tourism. But why did they not do this with 
the export sector two years ago? Now it would be leading the 
nation's development. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] You say that as a national development goal 
proposal. 
  [McBride] It is. We need a real and integral development 
plan, which is being denied for totally dogmatic reasons. 
  [Castillo Ochoa] But would not this call for a change or 
modification in the economic program mean tossing overboard what 
has been done on exports since 1990? 
  [McBride] I would never support sacrificing economic 
stability, the adjustment, and the reduction of inflation for 
some vague benefit. But we should start to think--as Dornbush 
said in his speech at Catholic University--that continuing to 
insist on reducing inflation is absurd at this time. I believe 
that what we need to do is reactivate the economy through 
exports by resolving the exchange arrears problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone from the "Union Radio News"] </F>
  [Text] Democratic Action [AD] Deputy Hector Alonso Lopez 
today requested that Luis Alfaro Ucero be dismissed from the 
secretary generalship. Here is Cecilia Cayone with a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Cayone] AD leader Alonso Lopez made the 
announcement during a news conference he called to explain the 
reasons for his request. 
  [Alonso Lopez, in progress]...so internal party elections 
are 
convened to elect Claudio Fermin as new AD secretary general. I 
see the Carlos Andres Perez case as the lethal weapon Alfaro 
Ucero is wielding to dash Fermin's hopes of becoming the new AD 
leader [words indistinct]. The real problem here is that Alfaro 
Ucero wants to perpetuate himself as leader and does not want to 
give Claudio Fermin an opportunity. Alfaro Ucero is spreading 
rumors that Claudio Fermin is the candidate of Carlos Andres 
Perez, thus seeking to divide AD between Perez supporters and 
opponents, between corrupt and honest people. This is 
unacceptable. 
  [Cayone] Deputy Alonso Lopez also underscored that, 
according 
to reports available to him, there is a plan brewing in AD to 
expel him, Claudio Fermin, Luis Emilio Rondon, and Antonio 
Ledezma. Asked about the possibility that Alfaro Ucero may 
refuse to resign, Alonso Lopez replied: 
  [Alonso Lopez] Some day it will be written that Luis Alfaro 
Ucero founded AD and ended up burying it. 
  [Cayone] Alonso Lopez added that he will make a formal 
request to dismiss Luis Alfaro Ucero from the secretary 
generalship during the National Directors Committee. [end

  [Text] The Central Bank of Venezuela will set the official 
dollar price according to supply and demand to eliminate the 
current auction mechanism. This will also allow the bank to 
eliminate distortions in the price of U.S. currency. 
  A mechanism for foreign currency exchange based on the real 
needs of the market will be implemented to replace the auction. 
The Central Bank of Venezuela will return to the single and 
floating exchange rate system, eliminating the 0.20-bolivar 
differential between the purchase and sale price. This new 
system is intended to eliminate the parallel market. Here is an 
excerpt of statements by Jose Bouza Izquierdo, National Banking 
Council president: 
  [Begin Bouza recording, in progress]...in other words, it 
will not be a mechanism like those that have existed so far. It 
will be based on real market prices. The dollar will cost what 
it must cost to guarantee that those who need dollars to 
continue operating can obtain them. The difference is that this 
will not be an auction based on average prices; the banks will 
make offers based on prices. 
  Later we will provide official information about the 
operational details of this mechanism, which will be worked out 
today. [end recording] 
  Juan Tomas Santana, president of the Banking Association of 
Venezuela, insisted that the authorities are trying to perfect 
the system of [words indistinct] dollars for the commercial 
banks. 
  [Begin Santana recording] [Words indistinct] that is why 
this 
is not being implemented. We don't know....[pauses] We want to 
implement this as soon as possible, but we cannot set an exact 
date. It must be done as soon as possible, because we want to 
clear up the market and allay the fears of the production 
sector, the general public, and the media about the auction 
mechanism. We want to eliminate those doubts, and it must be 
done as soon as possible. 
  If this mechanism proves ineffective, it will be corrected 
along the way. There is nothing perfect on this earth. [end 
recording] 
  This new mechanism of granting [word indistinct] to banks is 
also aimed at meeting the demand of the country's production 
sector, which, according to reports, has been seriously 
affected. More details will be given in the next few hours on 
this new scheme of foreign currency exchange.

  [Text] During a joint session, the legislative chambers 
have approved the law on public credit requested by the 
executive for a sum exceeding 156 billion bolivares. 
  [Reporter Cecilia Cayone] The only thing pending now is for 
the executive to adopt the necessary procedures to implement 
this so that public employees may receive the salary increase 
ordered by former President Ramon Jose Velasquez. Gustavo Tarre 
Briceno, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee, 
said that the National Congress made only a small change to the 
law submitted by the executive. 
  [Begin Tarre recording] The only modification made by the 
National Congress to the executive's request was to grant 300 
million bolivares to programs for Lake Maracaibo's eastern coast 
bearing on the (?survival) of that area. Some 60,000 people, 
living with the danger that the dike could break, have to be 
relocated. Although that program requires a lot more money than 
that, the Congress made this contribution. This decision, in 
conjunction with assistance already rendered and that was 
budgeted for next year, should resolve once and for all the 
problems affecting a region whose petroleum riches contribute 
the largest percentage of Venezuela's budget. [end recording] 
  [Cayone] By the end of this month or during the first 
quarter 
in June, public employees will be able to begin collecting their 
salary increase.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Ramon Meneses from Puerto Ayacucho] </F>
  [Text] DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] reports on the 
increasing use of Venezuela as a bridge for drugs have revealed 
that the "doors" also open to the south, specifically in the 
Amazon and Apure regions, a high-level police official has 
reported. 
  "This situation has been getting more serious every day. In 
past years, the drug barons, who were operating in neighboring 
Colombia, have transferred all their laboratories to areas in 
the Vichada and Guainia regions. It has been easy for them to 
work in those secluded areas because the presence of security 
forces is sparse there," Venezuelan intelligence officials have 
pointed out. 
  People know about the groups in Puerto Ayacucho but they 
move 
very cautiously due to the [words indistinct] with the movement 
of money and weapons. Many people have reported encountering 
drug traffickers when they are working in the Amazon region. 
Drug traffickers reportedly have opened roads in the Montana 
Fria, Rueda, and Garcitas areas, to the south of Puerto 
Ayacucho. They also reportedly opened another road in the 
northern area, very near Puerto Paez, to take advantage of 
Puerto Carreno and other Vichada towns. 
  A prominent National Guard official, who has been working 
against drug traffickers for several years, has reported: 
"People don't talk about them because they fear retributions, 
but seeing how the drug traffickers are increasing their ties in 
the region and apprehensive that their quiet existence in the 
Amazons may turn into violence like in Colombia, they are now 
cooperating and we have been informed of the drug traffickers' 
paths in the south." 
<H5>  The Road is Free on the Colombian Side </H5>
  Due to the freedom they have on the other side of the 
Orinoco 
[Colombia], Venezuelan authorities can do little about the 
presence of the drug traffickers on the Venezuelan side. The 
drug traffickers control entire towns in the neighboring country 
and authorities do not get close, sometimes due to fear and at 
other times due to compliance with the illegal activity. "Things 
are so serious that on one occasion we arrested a Colombian 
citizen who had a large amount of drugs on him in Puerto 
Ayacucho and we were surprised to find out that he was the top 
police official in a town close to the Amazon capital city. How 
can you fight this?" the official asked. 
  The Orinoco is a long fluvial highway, through which 
Venezuelan authorities, by an agreement signed with Colombian 
authorities, are able to transit freely. They did not consider 
that international right today would cause a serious problem on 
that bordering and depressed region where drug traffickers have 
set up their headquarters and where they secure allies in all 
the sectors of the, up until now respectable, community. 
  Enrique Betancourt, one of only two native governors that 
region has had in all its history, and one of the few strugglers 
against that scourge said: "When I was governor I ordered 
measures against all the drug traffickers' fronts, because I 
knew that it [drugs] was filtering through the weak and scarcely 
guarded border. Unfortunately my administration was short-lived, 
however, during those months not one act of violence took place 
in the state and not one case of kidnaping was reported, as is 
happening today, he noted. This scourge has been spreading its 
evil on several fronts of our community, from which officials of 
the security corps and officials of the governorship do not 
escape." 
  Betancourt said: "It is of no avail to report personal 
incidents linked to drug trafficking if a stiff and courageous 
response does not exist by those in charge of enforcing the law. 
These individuals, most of them from Caracas, become powerful 
lords based on false promises, a position from which they 
manipulate and operate under their superiors' complaisant gaze; 
this is also a crime," the former governor of that Amazon region 
stressed.

  [Text] Arrest warrants have been issued against four

detained by the National Guard. The arrest warrants were issued 
against four alleged perpetrators of drug trafficking based on 
Article 33 on the Basic Law on Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
and on Article 83 of the Penal Code. The arrest warrants were 
issued via the 48th Court and the First Criminal District of the 
Caracas Metropolitan Judicial District, which is headquartered 
in Los Cortijo de Lourdes. 
  Reportedly, this particular branch of the Medellin Cartel is 
using this nation as a bridge for drug trafficking to Europe and 
North America. Colonel Jairo Casimiro Coronel Figueroa, National 
Guard director of efforts against drug trafficking, identified 
the detained suspects as Ruben Dario Pelais Munera, German Perez 
Zapata, [name indistinct], and Luis Fernando Martinez. 
Meanwhile, [words indistinct] Carlos San Vincens Clavera were 
released. These last two had been detained for questioning. It 
was also learned that these four individuals will remain at the 
Judicial Detention Center in Las Flores, Catia.

  [Text] Caracas, 21 May (NOTIMEX) -- The first attempt of 
the administration of President Rafael Caldera to privatize 
Linea Aeropostal Venezolana (LAV) failed yesterday when four 
consortiums rejected the conditions set forth for its sale, 
Abdon Vivas Teran has reported. 
  According to Vivas, president of the Venezuelan Investment 
Fund (FIV, the organization in charge of privatizations), 
American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Aces of Colombia, and a 
local finance company refused to participate in the purchase. In 
the opinion of these four companies, the base price of $450 
million established for Aeropostal does not reflect the value of 
its assets. Vivas explained that although the consortiums 
expressed interest, they noted that its overvalue 
[sobredimensionamiento], its excessive number of retirees, the 
currency devaluation, and social instability are factors that 
must be assessed before making the purchase. 
  Vivas's statements at a news conference following the 
opening 
of the envelopes containing the consortiums' bids, suggest that 
they apparently requested, among other things, a reduction in 
the more than 3,000 employees of Aeropostal, the country's third 
largest airline. They also asked the government to guarantee 
currency stability, a negotiation of the number of retirees, and 
the "excessive social benefits" granted to Aeropostal employees. 
  The FIV minister-president said that the proposals of the 
consortiums interested in purchasing Aeropostal will be analyzed 
next Monday. He added that the Caldera administration will not 
budge in its effort to privatize state companies. 
  Caldera, who assumed the presidency in February, plans, 
within his economic stabilization program, to privatize six 
hotels this year and a similar number in 1995, as well as 
tourist services, Aeropostal, and electricity companies. 
According to FIV estimates, the sale of at least 13 companies, 
which should yield $1.8 billion to the state, will start this 
year. 
  The center of the privatization process is the electricity 
sector which involves the transfer to private hands of the main 
electricity plant and three distribution networks that represent 
88 percent of the revenues that the Executive Branch is 
expecting to receive. The remaining funds will come from the 
sale of the "La Rinconada" Racetrack, a milk factory (Indulac), 
Aeropostal (the third largest airline based on operations), 
ports, and six hotels rated as five, four, and three stars. 
  According to FIV figures, 36.3 percent of the revenues will 
be used to pay for the costs of the privatization process. The 
other 63.7 percent will help ease the serious fiscal deficit of 
over $4.5 billion, which represents more than 6 percent of the 
$63 billion GNP. 
  The sale of the stock of the national telephone company 
privatized in 1992 that is still in state hands (49 percent) is 
scheduled to take place next year and this will produce revenues 
of about $7 billion. 
  The privatization process started in Venezuela in 1989 as 
part of a plan to liberalize the economy and it yielded revenues 
of $2.6 billion as of 1993. Eighty percent of those revenues 
were used to cover the fiscal deficit.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace from the </F>
"Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Interior Relations Minister Ramon Escovar Salom 
anounced the creation of a specialized police unit within the 
Metropolitan Police to face street disturbances. The interior 
relations minister explained this unit will not be independent 
from the police. However, he continued, it will be formed by 
agents who will receive special training to handle 
demonstrations, because the riot police equipment gear is 
currently insufficient. 
  Escovar Salom stated this decision was made because the 
government will no longer tolerate violence, where buses are 
burned down and store windows broken. He stated his opposition 
to police using their fire power in student distrubances, but he 
also opposed street disturbances without controls by authorities. 
  [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Demonstrations must be 
conducted by observing a particular behavior. I explained to 
student leaders that they must carry out their actions 
peacefully; I asked them to assist not only the government but 
also Venezuelan society. 
  Regarding firearms, I don't think anyone in Venezuela wants 
to see police using their firepower irresponsibly. Therefore, we 
must observe certain principles. The police weapons are called 
regulation weapons; they can only be used in keeping with police 
regulations. Now there must be a specialized and trained corps 
to fight street disturbances. [end recording] 
  Escovar Salom termed the rumors of his alleged resignation 
from the Ministry of Internal Relations mere speculation. He 
reported he will soon present before Congress the Bill replacing 
the Law on Hoodlums and Thugs, which has been in force in the 
country since the times of former President Eliazar Lopez 
Contreras. 
  Finally, Escovar Salom reiterated categorically the 
government will use the public force to prevent the food boycott 
of Caracas, planned by a group of union members of Inerca 
[expansion unknown] who oppose the restructuring of Coche Market 
by an intervention board.

  [Text] The president of the five federations [of coca 
growers] of the Cochabamba tropical region has said that 
mobilizations could start at any moment. The coca growers are 
threatening to start blocking highways and stage rallies in 
Cochabamba demanding the abolishment of the supreme decree 
regulating the industrialization of coca leaf. 
  We will now listen to what Jorge Martinez has to say about 
the matter: 
  [Begin recording] [Martinez] [words indistinct] to again 
implement measures of pressure to demand the fulfillment of the 
claims made by the whole of Cochabamba because, so far, the 
government has done nothing but sign agreements and hold 
meetings, while in practice it has done nothing. 
  [Unidentified reporter] In addition to protest, will 
highways 
be blockaded? 
  [Martinez] There will probably be road blockades and protest 
marches in Cochabamba and the tropical regions. [end recording] 
  We wish to announce, moreover, that during our visit to the 
tropical region of the Chapare we were able to see for ourselves 
that there is no such militarization of the region; there are no 
troops in the tropical region of the Chapare, as has been 
reported. 
  This fact has been confirmed by William Condori, leader of 
the coca growers: 
  [Begin recording] In (Villa Catorce) and further inland, in 
the Simon Secure Park, we have confirmed reports that there is 
no type of militarization of the tropical zone in Cochabamba. We 
have also heard government spokesmen talk about the possibility 
of a militarization of the Cochabamba tropical region, but so 
far we have seen no troops. [end recording] 
  As you have just heard, there are no troops in the tropical 
Chapare region. 
  Condori also said there are no narco-guerrillas in the zone, 
and that it would be good for a special commission to enter the 
region to investigate reports of the alleged existence of 
narco-guerrillas.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 May -- Through a Supreme Decree signed by 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and his cabinet, the 
government has approved the "Regulations for the 
Industrialization of the Coca Leaf," in compliance with the 
agreements signed last week by the executive branch with the 
five Federations of Coca Producers of the Chapare region of 
Cochabamba and Yungas, La Paz. 
  This supreme decree, which will take effect once it is 
published in the official gazette, states the following: 
  "Whereas: 
  Article 4 of the Law on the Regulation of Coca and 
Controlled 
Substances No. 1008 defines the legal use and consumption of 
coca, the social and cultural practices of the Bolivian 
population in their traditional manners, such as the "aullico" 
or chewing, medical, and ritual uses; 
  Article 5 of Law No. 1008 defines: "Other forms of legal use 
of the coca leaves that are not harmful to human health nor 
cause any kind of addiction, as well as its industrialization 
for legal uses, will be the object of special regulations;" 
  The Bolivian Government has signed and ratified the 1988 
Vienna Convention, which in Article 14, Clause 2, states that 
the measures to eradicate the illegal cultivation of plants from 
which narcotics are extracted "must respect the basic human 
rights and must take into account the traditional legal uses of 
coca for which there is historical evidence as well as the 
protection of the environment;" 
  It is the government's obligation to regulate the 
industrialization process of coca leaf for medical uses, food,

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified author: "Fighting Crimes by </F>
Commiting Other Crimes"; first two paragraphs are HOY editorial 
introduction] 
  [Text] The APDHB [Bolivian Permanent Human Rights Assembly] 
states that almost all of the human rights guaranteed by the 
constitution are violated with the support of the governments in 
power. 
  "The APDHB does not defend criminals. We are not saying that 
we do not oppose terrorism or narcotics trafficking. What we say 
is that crimes cannot be fought by committing other crimes. 
Democracy has its own means of self defense, and that is what 
should be given priority." 
  On 2 May the Bolivian Permanent Human Rights Assembly 
(APDHB) 
officially stated: "Almost all of the human rights guaranteed by 
the constitution are violated in Bolivia with the help of 
government protection for excesses and abuses committed by 
police and other intelligence and repressive organizations and 
through the impunity which surrounds them." 
  The picture of the human rights situation is a devastating 
one because intelligence organizations and police forces have 
been accused by the APDHB of robberies, beatings, torture, 
improper arrests, kidnappings by persons wearing disguises and 
hoods, holding people incommunicado, raiding private homes and 
trade union offices, and other crimes. 
  However, the judges also stand accused because not only do 
they fail to investigate abuses and outrages reported by victims 
but they provide legitimacy to all of these proceedings. 
  In presenting an analysis of the human rights situation in 
Bolivia Waldo Albarracin, the president of the APDHB, has said 
that individual rights guaranteed by the national constitution 
are violated on a systematic and daily basis, condemning the 
people to growing anxiety and insecurity. 
  He added: "Fundamental rights are being violated. 
Unfortunately, the necessary political will is not being shown 
by successive governments, by the courts, and by Congress in 
setting up the machinery which would tend to ensure their full 
application." 
<H5>  Institutional Crime </H5>
  The violations of the law committed by the Mobile Police 
Unit 
for Rural Areas (UMOPAR), which is charged with carrying on the 
fight against the narcotics traffic, and the United States Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) are at the top of the APDHB 
list. 
  The president of the APDHB said: "UMOPAR raids homes, steals 
money and possessions under the excuse of confiscation, and 
improperly arrests people. There are more places of detention 
than are authorized by law. UMOPAR uses safe houses where 
citizens accused of drug trafficking crimes are tortured." 
  In the same study the president of the APDHB said: "We have 
learned that telephones are being tapped, the right of privacy 
is being violated, and investigatory bodies have a free hand in 
committing a series of oppressive acts." 
  He added: "We believe that the struggle against the 
narcotics 
traffic is necessary and just. However, in the name of this 
struggle crimes are being committed by those in power." 
<H5>  State Terrorism </H5>
  The APDHB said that the same thing is happening in 
connection 
with the investigation of cases and problems involving 
subversion. Using the argument of fighting against terrorism the 
national constitution is being violated. 
  The president of the APDHB said: "Unfortunately, the Special 
Center for Police Intelligence (CEIP) raids homes without a 
warrant. A large number of agents with their faces painted or 
covered up take people out of their homes and kidnap them 
because they have no warrant for their arrest." 
  He continued: "Furthermore, when family members complain, 
the 
police deny that their relatives have been arrested and only 
admit it publicly when they have obtained the information which 
they seek. They have even made prisoners confess things which 
they have not done, by subjecting them to degrading and 
humiliating treatment and torture." 
  He added: "It is difficult to identify the torturers, 
because 
the person arrested only sees another person wearing a mask." 
  Furthermore, the president of the human rights organization 
said that this kind of violation is accentuated when the case is 
turned over to the public prosecutor and, later on, to the 
ordinary courts. 
  The president of the APDHB said: "When a case reaches the 
courts, the judges, instead of ordering a detailed investigation 
of these violations or rejecting reports from the judicial 
police based on this kind of improper procedure, approve what 
has been done and order criminal trials." 
<H5>  Demonstrations and Repressive Acts </H5>
  The APDHB stated that other, specific evidence of how human 
rights are being violated in Bolivia is found in improper and 
arbitrary arrests during demonstrations held to obtain salary 
increases and satisfy other types of economic and social claims. 
  The APDHB stated that: "The police go out to stop marches 
and 
arrest people they meet indiscriminately and without lawful 
authority, keep them under detention in police cells, and later 
on and without any evidence turn these people over to the 
courts. No one has put an end to this kind of violation." 
  Albarracin mentioned the case of Judith Munoz, a journalist, 
arrested on a charge of terrorism. An attempt was made to 
incriminate her "in one way or another," in her own words. 
  Despite the fact that on 2 May a favorable decision was made 
on a writ of habeas corpus in her case and the Committee on 
Human Rights in the Chamber of Deputies ordered her release and 
an investigation of the case, she still faces a campaign of 
terror. 
  Albarracin stated: "It would not be surprising if, over the 
next few days, new criminal allegations are made against her, 
out of vengeance or in an attempt to justify the violations 
which the police committed previously." 
<H5>  What the Police Do Not Know </H5>
  The constitution clearly states that no one can be 
imprisoned 
except in cases provided for in the law. A detention order must 
be approved by a competent authority and must be issued in 
writing. 
  Albarracin said: "No order of arrest has ever been shown. On 
the contrary, the police arrest people with their faces covered 
up, thereby terrorizing those who are arrested." 
  The constitution states that holding a person in prison 
incommunicado cannot be ordered, except in cases of notorious 
seriousness and in no case for more than 24 hours. Albarracin 
said: "However, in Bolivia there have been cases of persons held 
incommunicado for more than 15 days." 
  The constitution also prohibits any kind of torture, 
extortion, or any kind of physical or moral violence, under pain 
of immediate dismissal. However, above all it provides that a 
person shall be presumed to be innocent unless his or her guilt 
is proved. All of these provisions are simply ignored. 
  Albarracin said that, as in the case of the above mentioned 
situations, there is a series of constitutional provisions which 
"amounts to nothing." He also pointed out that Law 1008 violates 
the whole constitutional structure, despite the fact that the 
constitution, the supreme law of the national, juridical 
structure, must be given precedence over ordinary laws and other 
legal provisions. 
  Albarracin said: "However, the police, under the protection 
of succeeding governments, violate the constitution with 
impunity, because these arbitrary actions are protected by the 
governments themselves."

    [Editorial Report] CARDENAS MEETS WITH EASTERN 
INDIANS--Meeting with representatives of Indian communities of 
Oriente, the Chaco, and the Amazon for the first time in the 
history of the Bolivian Republic, Vice President Victor Hugo 
Cardenas reviewed the contents of the Popular Participation Law 
promulgated on 20 April. He explained that the law recognizes 
peasant and Indian communities and, by increasing the number of 
municipalities from 21 to 301 nationwide, "will better cover 
health, education, and development needs in previously neglected 
areas." Cardenas stressed the importance of the right to vote 
under the new Law to elect officials who have the welfare of 
Indian communities in mind and who are committed to their 
development. He promised to push through Indian demands in the 
National Congress and said that he agreed with President Sanchez 
de Lozada that, without the development of these communities, 
democracy will remain "crippled." 
  Speaking on behalf of the Indian representatives, Vicente 
Pessoa, president of the Confederation of Indigenous People of 
Eastern Bolivia (CIDOB), affirmed his community's support for 
the Popular Participation Law if it responds to "specific 
demands" such as effective Indian participation in 
decisionmaking and management of the country, recognition of 
grass-roots organizations, and respect for traditional 
authorities and autonomy. Pessoa also asked that the Indian Law, 
which would guarantee Indian rights through succeeding 
administrations, be approved. The vice president responded that 
many of the concerns and principles of an Indian Law are already 
included in the Popular Participation Law and the Education 
Reform Law, soon to be passed in Congress. [Cochabamba LOS 
TIEMPOS 20 Apr] 
  URU INDIAN DEMANDS--Leaders of the Uru nation reject the 
government's new Popular Participation Law and instead have 
asked the government to reactivate the Integral 
Ethno-Developmental Plan launched in 1992 for the Uru, Ouechua, 
and Aymara communities. This plan aims at granting lands for 
agricultural use and raising of livestock, needed by these 
communities to "subsist and live with dignity," according to 
leader Juan Condori. He stressed his opposition to the 
government's Popular Participation Law, charging that "it is not 
true that it will serve the needs of the poorest." On the 
contrary, he said, this policy will "widen the gap between rich 
and poor." [La Paz PRESENCIA DEL PAlS 29 Apr] 
  POTOSI POVERTY--The Center of Studies for Labor and 
Agriculture Development (CEDLA) reported that Potosi Department 
is the nation's poorest, with 82 percent of households lacking 
even the most basic education, health, and housing services. In 
Potosi city, 46.7 percent of households do not have access to 
basic services. The rural inhabitants of the department are 
worse off, with 96 percent of households experiencing 
substandard living conditions. Of those who are economically 
active in Potosi City, 33.6 percent are self-employed, 13.8 
percent work for others in the private sector, and 25 percent 
are employed by the state, in contrast with larger Bolivian 
cities, where the public sector employs only 14 percent on 
average. The report concludes that, because of these problems, 
Potosi Department has one of the highest emigration rates in the 
country. [La Paz HOY 20 Apr] 
  GOOD AGRICULTURAL YEAR, EXPORTS--According to the Foreign 
Trade Directorate of the Ministry of Exports and Economic 
Competitiveness, 1993 was a good agricultural year. Agricultural 
exports totaled $136.7 million from January to September 1993, 
compared to $83 million the previous year. Leading exports 
included soy flour, $26.1 million; nonconiferous sawn timber, 
$26.2 million; soybeans, $14.1 million; refined sugar, $12.5 
million, shelled chestnuts, $9.5 million; raw cotton, $6.8 
million; and cowhides, $5.9 milliion. [La Paz PRESENCIA 19 Apr]

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said that 
Central American countries will assume a unified position at the 
fourth Ibero-American summit to be held next month in Cartagena, 
Colombia. This will be the second time President De Leon Carpio 
participates in this regional summit. 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...all the 
presidents and heads of state who will attend this important 
meeting, especially those of us representing Central America. 
We will not present individual proposals from each country, but 
a proposal as a family, as we have called it. With this in 
mind, we will have a preparatory meeting in El Salvador to unify 
opinions and criteria, particularly on a proposal we already 
presented -- I had the honor of presenting it recently in 
Washington -- on a pilot project for Central America for 
ecological protection and an alliance for sustained development 
of the area. Our forests and natural parks -- which no longer 
belong to us, but to mankind -- must be protected with the 
assistance of Ibero-American countries. This will probably be 
one of the proposals we will present in a unified manner. In any 
event, Central American countries will present unified proposals 
with the hope that many of them will receive a positive reply 
for our nations and for the Central American people. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When will this meeting take place? 
We understand that all the Central American presidents will 
arrive together. 
  [De Leon] The preparatory meeting will be on 31 May in San 
Salvador, on the occasion of the presidential inauguration. We 
will take advantage of that opportunity to exchange views and 
unify criteria. In August, we will arrive together at the 
summit of the Ibero-American presidents and heads of state to 
show our solidarity as a bloc, and our integration, which is not 
only economic but political and extends to all areas. We will 
meet in San Jose, Costa Rica, and from there all the Central 
American presidents will travel together in one plane, to show 
our solidarity and maintain our unity which has always been so 
necessary in Central America, and which today is more urgent in 
facing the economic and political blocs. I believe we are 
definitely advancing toward true Central American integration.

  [Text] Central American integration is indispensable during 
these special times in all aspects of life, according to 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio after meeting with 
representatives of several Central American integration 
organizations at the Presidential Palace. 
  The representatives handed the president the Central 
American 
integration flag adopted on 27 October 1993 on the occasion of 
the inauguration of the General Secretariat of the Central 
American Integration System [SICA]. 
  President De Leon Carpio said he is extremely pleased to see 
that the Central American solidarity project is being 
consolidated through all regional institutions. He called for a 
review of an integration program in that context that can allow 
for the conservation of the environment, which has already been 
discussed by the Central American presidents. 
  Representatives of the Central American organizations who 
gave the Central American integration flag to the president were 
the following: Juan Luis Guzman of the Central American 
Electrification Council; Jorge Cabrera and (Brenda de Curant) of 
the (Deprendenac) [expansion unknown]; Jorge Mario Aguilar of 
the Central American Industrial Research Institute; Rafael 
Flores of the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and 
Panama; and SICA Secretary General Roberto Herrera Caceres.

<F P=106> [From the "Congressional" column: "Not in English"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 20 May (NA) -- An odd episode took 
place at the meeting Radical Civic Union [UCR] deputies held 
with U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek to discuss 
Congress's deadline for passing the bill on invention patents. 
  The U.S. ambassador was received by the lawmakers at the 
staircase leading to the Chamber of Deputies. UCR Deputy Elsa 
Kelly extended Ambassador Cheek a welcome in English. 
  Without batting an eyelid, the U.S. ambassador replied in 
correct Spanish, leaving Kelly in quite an awkward situation. It 
seems the latter does not know that Cheek has not spoken his 
native tongue since he arrived in our country to begin his tour 
as ambassador. 
  Leaving aside this language issue, UCR Deputy Ernesto Algaba 
described the meeting's outcome without resorting to euphemisms. 
He said: "This is a carrot-and-stick policy, pure and simple." 
  Algaba emphasized: "When it suits them, we belong to the 
First World and when it does not, we belong to the Third World. 
On the one hand, they want us to enact legislation according to 
that of an industrial country, and on the other hand they treat 
us like an underdeveloped country in what pertains to trade 
matters." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 May (NA) -- Progressive Democratic 
Party [PDP] Deputy Alberto Natale emphasized today that U.S. 
Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek "should be declared persona 
non grata over his obvious meddling in the domestic affairs" of 
our country. 
  Natale criticized Cheek's position of "putting forth 
pressure, with all the means at his disposal, to effect changes 
in the patents law which would make it conform with the 
aspirations of U.S. pharmaceutical laboratories." 
  In a press communique, the legislator says: "The ambassador 
is confusing an expression of his compatriots' hopes of trade 
interests with the implementation of pressure through blunt 
threats, over the possibility that Congress will not fulfill 
their aspirations." 
  The PDP congressmen bloc leader noted: "An old Louisiana 
state law from the last century established that pressures are 
being exercised every time efforts are made to achieve results 
on a government decision by using any means other than resorting 
to reason." 
  In this regard, Natale said: "This is exactly what Cheek is 
doing and what, within diplomatic circles, is described as the 
right of the recipient country [pais recipiendario] to declare 
the official doing this as persona non grata." 
  Concerning the patents law, Natale indicated that we 
Argentines "have been governed by Law No. 111 since 1864, a law 
that we will change when the appropriate constitutional agencies 
decide to do so, and not when it coincides with the interests of 
foreign laboratories."

  [Text] Salta, May 22 (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo, 
Argentine ambassador to the United States, said that he supports 
the approval of a patents law, adding that "all countries, and 
not only Argentina, agree that it is advisable to recognize the 
intellectual rights of researchers." 
  Granillo said: "This is accepted even by the association 
organized to defend national laboratories. Besides, it is not an 
Argentine commitment with the United States alone, it is a 
commitment with the entire international community." 
  The ambassador recalled that Argentina "and another 106 
countries signed the GATT agreement," which "obligates" 
Argentina "to approve a law recognizing patent rights." 
  "The real problem will be if Argentina wants to join NAFTA, 
because the requirements here are much tougher and anyone 
wanting to join in must respect the local rules of the game," 
Granillo Ocampo said, during an interview with the daily EL 
TRIBUNO from this provincial capital. 
  Granillo Ocampo said Argentina "will try to balance what we 
and others must give up," adding that "we must not be afraid of 
this type of conflict, as on most other topics we are working in 
absolute harmony, together and in agreement." 
  The Argentine ambassador said "it was vital" for Argentina 
to 
join NAFTA "to consolidate the model," because "when a country 
coordinates its macroeconomic polices with other countries, the 
rules of the game are consolidated and stabilized." 
  Regarding Argentina's trade deficit with the United States, 
Granillo Ocampo said the situation was not dramatic, as the 
deficit is the result "of an important increase in imports in 
capital goods used in the incorporation of new technologies." 
  "Argentina let a lot of time go by without investing in 
technology. The deficit ended up producing a very large hole, 
which condemned the country to suffer a loss of competitiveness 
and trade deficits," Granillo Ocampo said. 
  The ambassador dismissed the possibility of creating a 
common 
front with Australia and the United States on agriculture 
subsidies, adding that "we are negotiating only because we must 
face a situation that hurts us all." 
  Regarding the purchase of planes equipped with radar, the 
ambassador said the country "got the planes it was looking for." 
  Asked about the possible sale of Pampa planes to the United 
States, Granillo Ocampo said: "Price conditions established in 
the offer will determine whether we can go ahead with the deal."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 May (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo today ruled out the possibility of joining 
Carlos Menem on a potential Justicialist Party presidential 
ticket for next year's elections, and claimed that these reports 
"aim at provoking confrontations with other candidates." 
  Cavallo stressed that he has "a great responsibility" as 
economy minister. He believes that those who are proposing him 
as a vice presidential candidate are doing it "to create an 
atmosphere of internal confrontation with other candidates." 
  Cavallo, who will participate tomorrow in a cabinet meeting 
in La Rioja Province after having returned from a tour of Korea 
and Japan, noted that "his concerns were very well received" in 
those two countries. He confirmed "the possibility of increasing 
exports" to Seoul. 
  The economy minister described as "complete nonsense" an 
article published by a Buenos Aires morning newspaper that he 
would be forced to devalue the peso without touching the dollar. 
  Cavallo emphasized: "Fortunately, markets pay no attention 
to 
this type of commentary." 
  Cavallo noted: "This is evidenced by the fact that the 
interest rates quoted in pesos are as low today as they were 
three months ago, despite the soaring interest rates quoted in 
dollars worldwide." 
  Cavallo said this "demonstrates the strength of Argentina's 
monetary and foreign exchange system." He emphasized: "Virtually 
no one speculates against the value of Argentine pesos, and the 
people are convinced that the Convertibility Law will last a 
long time." 
  Upon assessing his visit to Korea, Cavallo said he 
discovered 
in Korean entrepreneurial circles "great interest in the 
possibility of investing in Argentina." 
  Cavallo noted that some "large-scale" Korean investments in 
Argentina would begin to materialize in a short time. 
  In this regard, the economy minister said that Korea "will 
not aim to introduce goods made with cheap labor into our 
country, as there is no cheap labor in Argentina." In his 
opinion, "growth and the atmosphere of stability" attract 
investments. 
  Cavallo stressed: "In Argentina, as in Korea, they will have 
to manufacture products at a high or intermediate technological 
level, as the only way countries can pay high salaries is to 
manufacture high quality goods or create high quality services." 
  In remarks from Tokyo for radio "La 990" of Buenos Aires, 
Cavallo emphasized that "an atmosphere of stability prevails 
both in Argentina and throughout Latin America." He stressed: 
"We have the lowest inflation rate in Latin America, and we are 
growing." 
  Cavallo emphasized: "The Koreans and Japanese are interested 
in countries with dynamic growth rates, as they are used to an 
unending economic expansion, and Argentina now ranks third for 
the greatest growth rate over the past three years." 
  The economy minister also emphasized that the companies "see 
that our country has a policy that facilitates investments, as 
there are now no taxes on investments, and labor costs are being 
reduced." 
  In conclusion, Cavallo said: "I also trust in the 
implementation of a good labor reform that will allow our 
country to export to many more countries in the world, and 
specifically to all Latin American countries."

  [Text] La Rioja, 20 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
tonight denied the existence of a cabinet crisis prompted by 
disagreements between Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and 
Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza over the 
establishment of a security "super secretariat." 
  Menem said the decision to establish this secretariat and 
"to 
subsequently convert it into a ministry was made and 
acknowledged." 
  Nevertheless, Menem confirmed that this issue "was not 
discussed during the cabinet meeting." He announced that "maybe 
next week or later we will have some information on this issue." 
  Menem said: "We keep talking about the issue. We must not 
forget that there are eight laws on the security issue and that 
two extremely important institutions, the Argentine Coast Guard 
and the National Border Police, are involved." 
  Menem confirmed: "They are all subordinated to the Defense 
Ministry and their activities are coordinated with the Interior 
Ministry." 
  Menem indicated: "This legislation must be reconciled. We 
will continue to discuss this issue next week." 
  After an alleged argument with Bauza, Cavallo today walked 
out of a cabinet meeting with the obvious goal of returning to 
Buenos Aires. Before boarding the plane, however, he was 
persuaded by Labor Minister Jose Caro Figueroa to return to the 
cabinet meeting. 
  Menem explained Cavallo's and Caro Figueroa's departures, 
claiming that he had asked them to submit reports "on the 
progress of their respective ministries." 
  The president stressed: "I asked them to supply information 
on these issues so that the cabinet would be duly informed on 
basic aspects of the progress achieved by the two ministries." 
  The president told journalists at a news conference in La 
Rioja that "anything else you may say is sheer speculation." 
  Nevertheless, it is still not clear why Cavallo and Caro 
Figueroa had to go at full speed to the airport to get the 
information requested by the president, nor does it explain the 
efforts by the guards to prevent the departure of the economy 
minister's car.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 22 May (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo denied any intention of resigning over the 
dispute in the cabinet over the project to create a security 
super secretariat. He added: "If they are part of the 
government, those responsible for creating this terrible climate 
over the project must leave." 
  Cavallo said there is "a media conspiracy to stain the image 
of the Economy Ministry, and particularly the president." 
  Cavallo said: "I did not resign or even think about doing 
so." He added: "I am not scared as easily, particularly by press 
campaigns, as [former Interior Minister] Gustavo Beliz." 
  These remarks follow the cabinet crisis and bitter arguments 
between Cavallo and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf during a 
meeting in La Rioja on 20 May. Cavallo said the campaign began 
"when the press announced that the creation of the security 
secretariat and the appointment of Julian Licastro were my idea." 
  Cavallo said the conflict "has deeply hurt the government," 
adding that "those responsible for creating a wrong image of the 
project should leave." 
  The minister added: "The president had the idea of creating 
the secretariat. I told him I supported the idea but the 
proposal was not mine." 
  Cavallo told Buenos Aires newspapers that the fact that "the 
press campaign coincided with outrageous raids on the Economy 
Ministry, searching for papers that had been delivered to the 
court," was "intriguing." 
  Cavallo said the conflict affected him "marginally." He 
added 
that the campaign sought "to limit the president's prerogatives, 
while portraying the Economy Ministry as repressive, or 
something like that." 
  The minister observed: "No one, not even Cavallo or Bauza, 
imposes ideas or names on the president. Neither does the 
president go to work with a new minister the day after his 
appointment." 
  He added: "Those behind the campaign do not know the 
president." 
  Cavallo said: "President Menem's idea is very simple. He 
wants to divide the Interior Ministry in two. One section will 
handle political conflicts and the other will take care of 
security." 
  Cavallo said the first section "will require a lot of public 
coverage, press and television appearances, and dialogues with 
political leaders. This activity requires of a special type of 
person, like Ruckauf." 
  He said: "The president said we must separate politics from 
security." Referring to the interior minister, Cavallo said: 
"When Ruckauf talks about security, the surveys show us losing 
points." 
  He said: "Interior ministers all have that problem because 
the issue of security annoys them." 
  Cavallo said: "There are no legal problems, as the media 
mentioned." He thus referred to reports that the project to 
unify the Coast Guard, the National Border Police, and the 
police in a single body violated the 1991 Security Law. [passage

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- UCR [Radical Civic 
Union] Party President Raul Alfonsin has confirmed his rejection 
of a government project to establish a security secretariat. He 
believes this proposal "is at odds with a full state of law." 
  In a communique, the former Argentine president emphasized: 
"To establish this new government organization, it would be 
necessary to change basic laws." He asked the government "to 
maintain a responsible attitude, in keeping with our country's 
situation."

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires -- Defense Minister Oscar Camilion 
stressed on 23 May that it was "only the usual and simple 
disagreements that often happen in governments" that occurred 
during the cabinet meeting held on 20 May in the city of La 
Rioja. 
  At the end of a ceremony commemorating the creation of the 
Grenadiers Regiment that took place this morning in San Martin 
Plaza, the minister avoided making any more comments on the 20 
May meeting, although he did say: "No threats regarding 
resignations were made by the ministers," referring to Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
  Regarding the Security Secretariat's creation, the defense 
minister said: "It is an initiative that merits study, but 
taking into account current legal norms that currently are in 
force." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo believes the recent cabinet crisis "has not 
weakened the economic plan," and he indicated that it would be 
better not to create the Security Secretariat "until the public 
has been given an appropriate explanation about what is planned." 
  Cavallo referred to the controversial topic of the so-called 
super secretariat at the end of a ceremony in which agreements 
were signed for supplying drinking water to several provincial 
localities with financing from international organizations. 
  "President Carlos Menem has given a lot of importance to the 
topic and it is he who will finally decide it," the minister 
said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Commander Henry Ruiz, official in </F>
charge of Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, 
international relations and candidate for FSLN secretary 
general, by Radio Sandino Program Director Ada Luz Monterrey; 
place and date not given; from "The Sunday Drumbeat" newscast] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Ruiz] I believe we have made a 
historic decision. Remember that the FSLN, in which women have 
had a role, did not have a regulation compelling recognition of 
women. This is the first failure. 
  The other thing that makes this decision very welcome is 
that 
when one takes into account 30 percent against the true number 
of women in the party -- in my opinion this is not enough. It 
obliges us to pursue more participation by women. 
  Thus in practice we are making a decision that can take 
immediate effect and continue forging ahead. If we go to the 
other extreme, this is still a good intention, but the road to 
hell is paved with good intentions. I believe this is the best 
thing that could have happened to us. 
  [Monterrey] Remember, Henry Ruiz, that according to the 
media 
a proposal has been circulating to have the FSLN congress 
discuss a return to what was once called political commissars. 
This would empower the Sandinist Assembly to elect editorial 
boards and directors of Sandinist media. What is your opinion? 
  [Ruiz] I do not agree with this. 
  [Monterrey] Why? 
  [Ruiz] Two things are new to Nicaragua: First, real freedom 
of expression does exist. No party can have freedom of 
expression if decisions are made within the party to reduce this 
freedom. This is what makes the existence of parties possible, 
especially in the case of a revolutionary party. If we adopt 
this proposal, we would be going back to old practices. Second, 
publishing houses are our own media, but they are also 
businesses that have to compete. They must have an open market. 
If you place the media on a political footing with no eye on 
profits, it is very unlikely that it would survive. The FSLN, 
despite suspicions to the contrary, does not have large 
financial resources. Thus owners have to survive, so publishing 
houses, in an example of essential respect, must be so 
administered. 
  [Monterrey] If Commander Henry Ruiz is elected FSLN 
secretary 
general during this congress, what will your immediate action 
be: preserving FSLN unity or reducing the effects of what 
pessimists are forecasting if Commander Ortega does not win? 
  [Ruiz] I do not like to forecast schisms. I believe we have 
been and will emerge united. Some comrades have told me that 
there is already division. I have replied that it is not yet 
entrenched. (?Those who accept this have already committed 
suicide.) If the party is not unified, we are obliged to seal 
it up. I say let us bolt the party together, tighten the 
clamps, use some glue, and launch the party forward. As we 
approach 1996 we will see a split. I hold that if we don't win 
in 1996 -- in addition to the (?good people they have) and all 
these things that many times prove to be ideas on and intuitions 
of what is going on or has happened -- will be consolidated if 
they defeat us. [sentence as heard] 
  What is currently operating is a substitute model of the 
revolution, but it is a neoliberal model. If you add the fact 
that this has advanced so much, added to the three years 
remaining in this administration, added to a possible defeat, 
then you can forget about the revolution. Here is where 
Sandinists will have to implement other plans. If we as 
Sandinists have any conscience, we must realize that unity is 
the only chance if this fatality were to occur. [end recording] 
  On another topic dealing with events in Nicaragua, 
Commander Henry Ruiz, alias Modesto, told us: 
  [Begin recording] [Ruiz] I am happy because we have points 
of 
reference in Sandinism. The sad thing would be if Sandinism had 
no points of reference and everything were a crisis, chaos, and 
that we had to seek points of reference elsewhere, in other 
parties. That would be bad. Tardiness does not matter; the 
important thing is that points of reference have been found. 
The sad thing is that I am the only other candidate. It would 
be good if several of us were candidates for FSLN secretary 
general. 
  On the question of what must be done to regain our power, I 
believe that if we use our historical strength... [pauses] we 
have always been dynamic, strong, mystical, and [words 
indistinct] when our goals are unclear. I believe there is a 
key goal, but we do not know how to reach it. This requires a 
national plan that includes what I call the regaining of power. 
I do not say government because I insist this is not a 
government problem. It has to do with providing the executive 
branch and the legislative branch with enough power so that they 
can exercise other policies and lead the country out of 
stagnation while stopping neoliberal policies. 
  If we examine this in the face of international realities, 
it 
is obviously not an easy task. Look at Venezuela. Carlos 
Andres lost the elections [as heard] and see where he is now. 
But Caldera is committed to the neoliberal plan, and there is 
already word of a future social explosion in Venezuela. We are 
committed to this neoliberal plan because this is what the 
government established and signed. It will last until 1997. 
  We need to pursue a kind of national referendum in 
connection 
with the country's problems and see how we -- the government -- 
can deal with them, establish what we are going to propose, what 
solutions to offer, and how these solutions are attainable. 
When we put all these things down on a single piece of paper I 
believe this will once again give Sandinists a point of 
reference and the resolve to work. I believe that the debate, 
which we have tried to run down, has given us something that is 
quite tangible: We have risen, and we are [words indistinct] and 
energy. So if we find these things we will have moved ahead. 
[end recording] 
  These relations will improve to the extent the United 
States allows them to improve. We cannot stop supporting just 
causes we have supported in the past, we are supporting now, and 
as we will hopefully continue to support in the future. The 
fact that we have been so supportive of our brothers in El 
Salvador caused us serious problems with the United States. 
Nevertheless, just for the sake of avoiding problems, we could 
not stop supporting our Salvadoran brothers. For the sake of 
avoiding problems with the United States, we will never stop 
supporting our Cuban brothers. 
  This means that in the face of our efforts to improve our 
relations with the United States, we must not turn our backs on 
our principles and our historic roots -- things we are obliged 
to maintain. In this sense, I think we must carefully examine 
the evolution and developments that have taken place in the 
United States. 
  The Reagan and Bush administrations are not the same as 
today's Clinton administration. There are substantial 
differences, and, I might add, numerous differences. President 
Clinton has assumed certain positions for reasons of political 
interest, and also for reasons linked to his own personal 
choices. He has shown openness in relations with ethnic groups, 
with homosexuals, and with women -- an openness which, at the 
same time, has not been manifested in relations with countries 
that have been under attack, such as Cuba. Perhaps the alignment 
of various forces within the United States is not permitting 
President Clinton to be more broad in his openness. [two-second 
break in reception] 
  As congress president, I ask you to grant me a few more 
minutes. Much has been said about this topic. Some have 
mentioned the problem of the Sandinist anthem and suggested we 
eliminate the words of the anthem. I believe that, in fact, 
there are other anthems in the world which have their own 
characteristics and which are historic. I think, however, that 
the words of the Sandinist anthem go far beyond this and reflect 
a deeply historical significance. We have been victims -- and I 
reiterate this -- and we have not been responsible for 
victimizing others. 
  Aside from maintaining and carrying out efforts to establish 
relations with the United States, we must keep our 
anti-imperialist principles intact. I also believe it is 
necessary to say here and now that the Sandinist Front is, and 
will continue to be, anti-imperialist. [applause] 
  We have proposed other motions within this same spirit. I 
would like to see an overall approval of these motions. There 
are some portions to which you contributed with words and 
actions, which will be reviewed by the commission to summarize 
and improve, if possible, this important portion of our program.

<F P=106> [Statement by Tomas Borge Martinez, president of the </F>
Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, Special Congress, at 
the congress in the Olof Palme Convention Center in Managua -- 
live] 
  [Text] Someone has already noted that this is a very 
important section in our program. It is entitled "FSLN Position 
With Regard to Relations With the U.S. Government." It does not 
say with the U.S. people but, rather, with the U.S. Government. 
The language used in the Program Commission's proposal is very 
selective. However, I believe that, in general terms, it 
essentially explains the positions we must assume in this new 
international situation and in this new era that people are now 
experiencing. 
  Nicaraguans, not to mention Latin Americans, must be clear 
about the reasons for assuming an anti-imperialist position. It 
was not a coincidence that when the FSLN was founded, Carlos 
Fonseca proposed that it only be called the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front in the face of other proposals to call it the 
National Liberation Front and other names. 
  When our founder and leader was asked why he wanted it to be 
called the Sandinist National Liberation Front, he explained 
that it was not only named after Sandino, who was a hero to the 
world, Latin America, and Nicaragua, but that it was also named 
after the anti-imperialist content of Sandino's struggle. In 
this way, we were recording, and recording forever, the 
anti-imperialist content of the Nicaraguan people's struggle. 
  Years passed, and time and time again we relived a history 
of 
aggression from U.S. administrations. Nicaraguan history is 
basically a history of U.S. intervention. It is a history that 
produced Zeledon and Sandino and, to a great extent, produced 
the FSLN. The United States imposed Anastasio Somoza and his 
criminal dictatorship which lasted several decades, and, in 
turn, the Nicaraguans' revolutionary and popular struggle 
resulted from this imposition. 
  We must ask ourselves: What kind of relations do we want 
with the United States? Do we want a relationship of enmity and 
confrontation? On the contrary, we want a friendly and 
harmonious relationship with the United States. 
  Nevertheless, this friendly and harmonious relationship does 
not depend on us. It is important to remember that we are not 
ones who caused harm. Instead, we were the victims. It is 
important to remember that we never attacked the United States; 
it attacked us. It is not true that we can forget our history. 
He who forgets his history forgets himself. The essence of a 
people lies in their history. If we want to substantially 
improve our relations with the United States, we cannot forget 
the history of U.S. aggression against Nicaragua. [applause]

objective. It is our objective to get the government to change 
its economic policy, solve the property problem once and for 
all, give financing to producers in terms that will truly 
increase production in our country, thus creating jobs in the 
production sector. These are among the efforts that we must 
make throughout our country to promote a broad national 
movement, with workers, producers, and cooperative members -- 
with all the Nicaraguans who are truly interested in stability 
and who seriously feel affected by the neoliberal policies of 
the current administration. 
  We must prepare ourselves to win the November 1996 
elections. 
To win the elections, our contact with the people, our 
commitment to the people, and our [word indistinct] with the 
various sectors of Nicaraguan society become vital to attaining 
that goal. 
  This special FSLN congress session is a new experience 
within 
the party because in the 1970's, in 1976, at that moment, the 
Sandinists were unable to accept their differences, discuss 
them, and channel them into actions and practical tasks in the 
serious confrontation with General Somoza. This led the FSLN to 
a division. It was the struggle against Somoza that reunited us 
until we triumphed on 19 July 1979. 
  Now we have gone through four years in which new 
contradictions have appeared within the FSLN. They are not the 
same contradictions we experienced when we were fighting Somoza, 
because we all had to cooperate against the Somoza dictatorship 
which involved the eradication of imperialist domination in our 
country. We had differing views on that. 
  It is not a matter of defeating the Somoza dictatorship now. 
It is a matter of defending revolutionary achievements and we 
have had differences on that. The new economic situation in 
Nicaragua imposed by the government's neoliberal policies affect 
society. These policies continue to cause increased 
unemployment, poverty, homelessness, hunger, and desperation for 
the Nicaraguan people. 
  We must fight that. It is no longer a matter of ousting a 
government with weapons, it is a matter of fighting [12-second 
break in reception] new forms or struggle and organization. 
  In these past four years, we also struggled to defend the 
institutions that are pillars of the country's stability. They 
are institutions whose missions contradict our views and the 
sectors and people we defend. [sentence as heard] These 
contradictions occur under certain circumstances. I am 
referring, of course, to the National Police and the Sandinist 
People's Army. These are two institutions that were created by 
the revolution. These are institutions that the FSLN and the 
revolution bequeathed to the nation and the Nicaraguan people. 
These are institutions that according to the Constitution and 
our country's laws, and the Constitution that was approved in 
1987, are subordinate to the government that is in office. 
There is a big contradiction there. The Armed Forces are 
subordinate to the government that is in office. However, the 
government that is in office is implementing policies that 
involve depriving people of their property, sending workers to 
the unemployment lines, lowering the workers' salaries, and 
denying basic services to the people. 
  The people, rightfully so, make their demands, protest, and 
take to the streets to make their voices heard. The government 
sends the police, and sometimes the Army, to repress the people. 
  The extreme rightist forces in the United States and 
Nicaragua are plotting to destroy the Army and the police that 
are clearly identified as offspring of the revolution and not of 
the counterrevolution. So, this is another contradiction we 
have been experiencing throughout these past years. It has 
prompted differing reactions and positions within the Sandinist 
family. 
  There is also the National Assembly. It is no longer the 
Assembly in which we held a majority. It is the National 
Assembly where we are the main political force but without a 
majority. We have 39 deputies. It is a new experience, but one 
that has also resulted in contradictions. There is also our 
work at the municipal level done by councilmen at mayoralties 
where the FSLN won. 
  This new context creates new types of contradictions: the 
privatization of state-owned enterprises. Because of the 
struggle we headed, in which workers and peasants courageously 
defended their enterprises, we advocated the transfer of these 
enterprises to the workers. However, problems arose later with 
regard to the fulfillment of duties. 
  As has been mentioned on several occasions, the struggle is 
being carried out by one sector, not the majority sector. Most 
Nicaraguans are not participating in the struggle directly. The 
struggle is being carried out by the peasants, the workers of 
enterprises, the companeros, the tobacco factory workers, the 
coffee and rice workers, and the workers at agricultural 
enterprises. They are not [words indistinct] Nicaraguan people 
but they are defending basic achievements for the 
democratization of the country's economy which is aimed at a 
better distribution of Nicaragua's wealth and achieving 
stability for the benefit of the nation. 
  Thus, if [words indistinct], if we want to gather a certain 
sector so that the struggle will be for the benefit of 
Nicaraguan society, we must defend an economic model that is 
truly democratic and must include a better distribution of 
property. 
  The defense of the workers' property is a struggle that has 
resulted in contradictions. But after the enterprises were 
privatized and put in the workers' hands, new contradictions 
appeared among the workers. The enterprises (?went broke) and 
the workers became unemployed. [Words indistinct] these 
enterprises privatized for the benefit of workers have left 
workers without any benefits. 
  There are very clear explanations with regard to this but 
this has created new contradictions in the great Sandinist 
family, contradictions among the workers. 
  We could [words indistinct] many contradictions caused by 
the 
new situation. These contradictions have become evident 
throughout the country; that is why it was so important to hold 
this coordinated congress session. Why? To hear the questions 
of the FSLN and to achieve FSLN unity. Simply, the leadership 
organizations, as we said in the first FSLN Congress in 1991, 
could no longer provide answers to all these problems. In this 
way, with this special congress session, jointly with the 
debates on the economic problems and the situation in the rural 
sector, we have discussed organizational problems. We also 
chose new authorities. We mainly chose new leadership 
organizations. 
  Yesterday, you issued a call for unity. We came to this 
special congress session for the sake of unity and, precisely, 
to achieve unity, we had to discuss the topics that have been 
the source of contradictions. 
  We would not have accomplished much by having each one of us 
explain our views; they are well known. The members of the 
previous National Directorate have voiced their views in the 
media many times. You know them. You have drawn our attention 
to the fact that we have been voicing our opinion in a way that 
does not help to better guide and unite the Sandinist population. 
  Imagine, then, if the members of the previous National 
Directorate had spent all day explaining our views and arguing, 
we would have gotten nowhere. The right path was to convoke the 
special congress session. Based on the discussions in this 
special session, we had to seek agreements on the issues that 
have separated us. 
  What is our stand in the face of the government? This is a 
separate issue. Consequently, it is a determining factor if the 
FSLN leaders were to abide by what the congress members say, 
which is the voice of unity. We must abide by what they say 
with regard to what? To problems that have been [words 
indistinct] voted democratically. 
  Another issue we must not hide is [words indistinct] 
methods. 
Then, this topic [words indistinct] Sandinist Assembly [words 
indistinct] contradictions continued. Thus, to solve this 
problem there was no other way than to begin discussions, but 
not among eight companeros of the National Directorate or among 
70 members of the Sandinist Assembly. We had to go beyond that, 
we had to go to the territories, the assemblies in the 
departments and municipalities, and, finally, this special 
congress session to [words indistinct] last word, and in any 
case [words indistinct] leaders. The leaders have to be 
disciplined. With regard to what? With regard to the agreements 
that are made in this special congress session and this is how 
we will strengthen unity. [applause] 
  This has been a democratic process. Any companero who says 
that this was not a democratic process because things did not 
turn out the way he wanted, will not be doing the FSLN any good. 
  In this very same place, a little over four years ago, on 25 
February, better yet, on the dawn of 26 February, we accepted 
the decision of the Nicaraguan people who voted against us. We 
accepted that decision here. We must also learn to be 
democratic within the Sandinist family. Being democratic 
involves accepting the vote cast by members of congress with 
regard to topics discussed in the statutes, the program, the 
topics that were incorporated in the session, and the 
authorities who were elected to the Sandinist Assembly, the 
National Directorate, and other commissions. 
  It would be bad for a companero to go out and say that this 
is not democracy, because I would ask him: What is democracy 
then? People cannot be democratic from an anti-democratic 
position. That would be a position one would assume if things 
do not come out the way one thinks they should. If they do not, 
then one gets upset and rejects the vote. Thus, one would be 
disregarding the capacity, the intelligence, and wisdom of the 
companeros who discussed the issue. One cannot go around saying 
that it was not worth it, simply because things did not work out 
the way someone felt they should have. 
  We must strengthen the Sandinist family's democracy with 
deeds more than words. Of course, [words indistinct] perhaps it 
is hard for us to be consistent with democracy. We all say we 
favor democracy but when the time comes, not all of us keep our 
commitment with democracy. 
  In the elections here, we must emphasize that the will of 
the 
assembly held in the territories and in this congress with 
regard to the quotas given to women has been respected. 
  But it must further be stressed that the five companeras who 
became members of the National Directorate got their positions 
without the need for a quota. According to a report by the 
companeros in the Electoral Committee, the companeras received 
enough votes for membership in the National Directorate. 
[applause] 
  Seventy-five percent of the Sandinist Assembly was renewed, 
and this will inject new strength and energy into the FSLN. They 
included two mayors, 12 deputies, and 10 departmental political 
secretaries. Thirty percent of the Sandinist Assembly, as 
agreed, is made up of women whom, we are sure, will strengthen 
the work of our organization. 
  The candidates who received the most votes in these 
elections 
were women. Gladys Baez got 365 votes and Carmen Villanueva had 
345 votes. [applause] In the Sandinist Assembly, there are at 
least 15 companeros who come from the ranks of Sandinist youth. 
The youngest is Maria Esther Solis, who is 22 years old. 
[applause] Also in the Sandinist Assembly is a mother of heroes 
and martyrs, Gloria Martinez, who lost three sons. [applause] 
  Three companeros from the Atlantic coast have joined the 
National Directorate: companera Dorotea [Wilson], companera 
Mirna [Cunningham], and companero Lumberto [Campbell]. Las 
Minas, Bluefields, and Puerto El Rio are represented here. 
  When the special session began, there were 487 or 488 
congress members. In the last vote, the Electoral Committee 
companeras just told me, there were 447. In total, 447 
companeras and companeros voted. This shows true discipline, 
true commitment. 
  All the brothers, companero and companera congress members 
who have been meeting and participating in the debates and 
decisionmaking process in this special session show the high 
spirit [words indistinct] sleepless and tired to the last minute 
of this special congress session. 
  But, well, we are going to begin working. There is a 
transitional provision that was approved. It was the last 
provision approved here in the Congress, and it states: By the 
powers vested in the Special Congress session, the Sandinist 
Assembly is to hold elections for the members who will make up 
the National Electoral Committee. This election must be held 
during the first regular session of the Sandinist Assembly to be 
held within 15 days of the closing of the Special Congress 
session. 
  I want to propose here to the brothers and sisters of the 
National Directorate not to wait 15 days. Let us convoke the 
Sandinist Assembly this week, on Thursday. It will not be to 
discuss this topic but to draft a work agenda so that we can 
begin complying with the decisions made by the companeros who 
participated in this special congress session. 
  We are closing this special session in the hope that it 
will yield positive results for FSLN unity. We must report that 
some companeros who have been members of our leadership are now 
members of the Sandinist Assembly. Nevertheless, we are sure 
that the companeros and companeras who have held specific posts 
will continue to work in and for the FSLN. We must make an 
effort so these companeros and companeros do not feel hurt or 
mistreated by the democratic decisions made in this special 
congress session. We must continue to defend the participation 
of Nicaraguan people, who come from various economic and social 
sectors, in work with the FSLN. We are not saying we favor an 
FSLN that excludes those who possess more and retain those who 
possess less or nothing. We will continue to struggle with an 
FSLN that opens its arms to all Nicaraguans who love this 
homeland, this people, and this revolution. Our brother Gerty 
Lewites, who has not left and we are sure will not leave, is 
here with us. [applause] 
  The time has come to act with great maturity and calm. Above 
all else, it is time to appeal to humility because all this will 
contribute so that unpleasant actions, such as decisions [words 
indistinct] and debates on subjects that have been voted and 
approved, with their corresponding reactions, perhaps have not 
been presented as we would have desired. 
  We have to wait, then, for that attitude [sentimiento] that 
I 
mentioned to ensure that our FSLN is indeed strengthened, that 
unity is indeed strengthened, and that we defend it every day 
with words and deeds. Long live FSLN unity! [Audience responds 
"Viva!"] Long live the unity of all the people! [Audience 
responds "Viva!"] Sandino lives! [Audiens responds "Sandino 
lives!"] Free homeland! [Audience responds "Or death!"] 
[applause]

  [Text] Managua, 23 May (AFP) -- Official sources have 
reported that today, at the conclusion of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN] Special Congress, former Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega was reelected secretary general of his 
party for a new three-year period. 
  Ortega was able to secure the support of the majority of the 
"orthodox" sector of the FSLN for his proposal to maintain the 
party's traditional struggle politicies in opposition to the 
current endorsed by his election adversary, Henry Ruiz, a 
legendary Sandinist leader who represented the reformist sector 
of this political organization.

  [Text] Managua, 23 May (DPA) -- Former President Daniel 
Ortega, via an apparatus that remained loyal to him during the 
Special Congress that ended here today, has led his party into a 
stage of purging those Sandinist leaders who were promoting the 
change and renewal of the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
(FSLN). 
  As Ortega exerted control over the party and was reelected 
to 
another three-year term as FSLN secretary general, he was able 
to convince his delegates to purge the leader of the Sandinist 
bloc, writer Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who heads a 
reorganizational current that identifies itself with "a 
Sandinist party that is returning to the majority." 
  The "overwhelming number" of delegates loyal to Ortega also 
purged Commander of the Revolution Jaime Wheelock Roman, who is 
currently attending Harvard University in the United States. 
Ramirez, as well as Wheelock, were members of the FSLN National 
Directorate. 
  The purge also affected the highest decisionmaking 
organization within the FSLN (the Sandinist Assembly), which 
previously had 120 members, 57 of whom (48 percent) were purged 
from their posts within the assembly. Some 15 new posts were 
created for members closely connected to the orthodox group, 
whose improved position in the body will have a negative effect 
on eight deputies, a minister in Violeta Chamorro's 
administration, and Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) President 
Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren. 
  Some 78 percent of the highest FSLN organization are now 
members associated with Daniel Ortega's orthodox current. 
Meanwhile, the reorganizational sector only garnered 22 percent 
of the posts in the elections held at the Sandinist session, 
whereby the statutes and internal regulations of the party were 
reformed. 
  The FSLN National Directorate, which previously had nine 
members, was enlarged to 15 members during the Congress. Tomas 
Borge, former interior minister during the Sandinist regime; 
Daniel Ortega; Bayardo Arce; Rene Nunez; Henry Ruiz; Victor 
Tirado Lopez; and Luis Carrion were reelected as National 
Directorate members. Meanwhile, Monica Baltodano, Lumberto 
Campbell, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Rene Vivas, and Dorotea Wilson, 
all from the orthodox current, as well as peasant Benigna 
Mendiola, Deputy Dora Maria Tellez, and Mirna Cunningham, all 
from the reorganizational sector defeated by the conservative 
current headed by Daniel Ortega, were elected as new members of 
the Sandinist Directorate. 
  After Sandinist bloc leader Sergio Ramirez was purged by the 
orthodox group, he reported hegemonic practices were carried out 
at the Congress, and, in turn, he informed journalists that the 
party is already divided, which will prompt yet another crisis 
within the FSLN bloc in Congress. 
  Because of reforms to the FSLN statutes, Daniel Ortega was 
granted maximum authority that could even help him occupy 
Ramirez's seat in the Parliament, thereby replacing his main 
ideological enemy. This situation could trigger the division of 
the FSLN bloc. 
  Only five of the 39 FSLN deputies are loyal to Daniel 
Ortega, 
which indicates that should the reelected secretary general want 
to install himself as chief of the FSLN legislators by ignoring 
the regulations established by the deputies to reelect their 
leader, the Sandinist bloc could join other legislative blocs 
that make up the Political Bloc Council, thereby leaving 
deputies loyal to Ortega in a minority bloc. 
  The FSLN Special Congress also will prompt purges in the 
mouthpieces of the party, especially in BARRICADA, run by Carlos 
Fernando Chamorro Barrios (President Violeta Chamorro's son), 
who belongs to the reorganizational current of the FSLN. 
  As she hinted that Ortega will appoint himself or another 
FSLN deputy as leader of the Sandinist bloc, Monica Baltodano, 
new member of the Sandinist Directorate and representative of 
the orthodox current, said the editorial line of the 
aforementioned newspaper will be revised. 
  Only 487 of 566 national delegates attended the Sandinist 
Congress. Daniel Ortega is controlling most of them. 
  Sandinist sources reported that nothing focusing on the 
unification of the party was discussed at the Congress, although 
in speeches by orthodox members, including the closing speech by 
Daniel Ortega himself, Ortega was depicted as an advocate of 
party renewal. As he talked about those purged within his party, 
he pointed out that these people personify the bitter results 
that must be accepted under Sandinist democracy. 
  The Sandinist session, which took place at a convention 
center in Managua, and which was guarded by nearly 100 
plainclothes and armed police officers, cost the party $350,000.

<F P=106> [Article by Cristiana Chamorro Barrios: "The Sandinist Front </F>
Today"] 
  [Text] The electoral experience in 1990 and the one in 1994 
on the Atlantic coast were evidence that the Sandinist Front was 
worn out, a situation that is somewhat unusual for a party that 
has been comfortable in opposition. It is obvious that the two 
political setbacks were caused by differences among its leaders 
-- the "historic vanguard" -- and the workers and peasants they 
claim to represent. 
  According to the Marxist-Sandinist theory implemented in 
Nicaragua during the 1900's, "the masses were not cultured." 
They had to be educated politically because their interests at 
the "moment" did not coincide with the long-term interests of 
the Sandinist revolution. 
  The party leadership, therefore, said it had to interpret 
"the people's will" and consequently lead them down a certain 
path, even if in contravention of the people's will. After all, 
the Sandinist Government system had the coercive means to 
"convince," warn, or exclude those who doubted the validity of 
its arguments. 
  The fact is that the Sandinist Front lost power; this was 
not 
envisioned in any chapter of its doctrine. In 1990 the 
government of Violeta Chamorro changed the historical tradition 
from dictatorship to democracy -- destroying the adversary 
through a policy of reconciliation -- and the Sandinist Front 
did not have a violent or defying opponent that could justify 
the preservation of its authoritarian and rigid position. 
  The new democratic order penetrated the party structures, 
allowing its rank and file the space and means to express its 
opinions freely, evidence of the contrasting interests between 
the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] and its masses 
until the latter, one way or another, had its interests prevail 
over the messianic projects of the vanguard. Among other failed 
plans was the idea of regaining power by creating revolts, 
strikes, kidnappings, disturbances, social disruption, and chaos 
that would supposedly topple the new system established by the 
people's vote. 
  Finally, Nicaraguan democracy dragged the party deep into an 
identity crisis. Today it is divided between the interests of 
the rank and file, which is contaminated by democracy, and those 
of the messianic projects. Apparently, the democrats have found 
an interpreter in the self-styled "For a Sandinism that will 
return to the majority" trend. They are proposing changes to 
the rigid party position, making it conform to democracy. They 
believe that if the party does not achieve ideological, 
organizational, and structural democratization, the FSLN will be 
abandoned by the popular groups that still follow it and will be 
reduced to a small group of agitators. 
  The other current, which controls the chains of command on 
diverse levels of the party's current organization, is the 
self-styled "Democratic Left." Apparently it is not willing to 
accept a renewal that would allow participation by the rank and 
file. Recent party assemblies, convened before the special 
congress that will be held today, have confirmed that the FSLN 
is dominated by its inability, both structural and ideological, 
to adapt to Nicaragua's existing democratic circumstances. 
Majority resolutions against the Democratic Left were 
eliminated and manipulated by the party, confirming that that 
sector is not ready to relinquish its privileges. 
  The special congress today offers the FSLN an excellent 
opportunity to overcome that division and emerge as a single, 
strong, organized party, committed to democracy, peace, and 
economic development. If this commitment is not achieved, those 
who have proclaimed the renewal and democratization of the party 
will have only two alternatives: to perish politically, devoid 
of credibility, or to be true to their proposals, ridding 
themselves of their rigid position in order to be reborn 
democratically in the modern history of Nicaragua.

<F P=106> [Article by Edgard Barberena S.: "Aspects of New Military </F>
Law" -- part one] 
  [Text] The new military law establishes that military 
members who commit common crimes will be tried by common courts 
and will only fall under military jurisdiction for crimes that 
are strictly military. This will be outlined in an upcoming law 
that will be called the military penal code. 
  While this (military) penal code and its respective 
provisions are not approved by the National Assembly, the 
regular tribunals will continue to function temporarily. With 
the approval of the military law, no civilian can be brought

financially controlled by the corresponding government 
organization, it was learned.

    [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish on page 3A 
of its 24 April 1994 edition reports that, according to former 
National Assembly president Alfredo Cesar, the seven remaining 
parties of the National Opposition Union plan to remain in a 
coalition through the end of President Chamorro's term, but are 
uncommitted to an alliance for the 1996 election. He stated: 
"The parties are united by a commitment to put into effect the 
government program." Cesar denied that he has lobbied for the 
position of finance minister because of rumors that Finance 
Minister Emilio Pereira will leave the post. He said that he 
does not wish to work with a government which has lost 
"influence and credibility....I have no relations with 
(Presidency) Minister Lacayo, nor do I want to. Not with Lacayo 
or any member of the government team." With regard to 1996, 
Cesar observed that a liberal-conservative alliance of two or 
three parties is "possible" and "desirable." Based on recent 
polls he predicted that no member of the government will win 
more than 8 to 10 percent of the votes in 1996.

    [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish on page 6 
of its 27 April 1994 edition reports that the Bank of Nicaragua 
(Banic), which is near its lending capacity, sold to the Bank of 
Central America part of its 60 million cordoba loan portfolio in 
order to increase its loans to the production sector. Banic 
General Manager Esteban Duquestrada pointed out that while banks 
are allowed to lend up to 16 times their capital, the private 
banks are "generally reluctant" to grant credit. The sale of the 
loan portfolios is being financed by AID, according to the 
article. Duqestrada said that one of the drawbacks of the 
program is that state banks are losing their best customers to 
the private banks, which will only purchase the portfolios of 
the best loan risks.

  [Excerpts] Today, President Carlos Roberto Reina was upset 
and angered by an article published in THE ECONOMIST, a British 
magazine, in which Honduras, together with Iraq and Bosnia, is 
described as a country where investment is risky. 
  [Begin Reina recording] I ask all of you to repudiate the 
article. I am sure you are all patriots and you cannot accept 
such rude remarks. Honduras is a country that is making huge 
efforts to ensure legal security and to compare Honduras with 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, where even the bodies of the dead are being 
eaten, is unforgivable rudeness. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  While the article that appeared in THE ECONOMIST continues 
to 
provoke reactions and the awakening of patriotism in some 
sectors, the Honduran Foreign Ministry did not give much 
importance to the article and denied that it will protest the 
article published in that important magazine.

  [Text] Arnulfist Party [PA] President Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber reported that the PA National Directorate has decided to 
accept the resignation of Carlos Sousa Lennox, who accepted a 
post in the Ernesto Perez Balladares administration, rather than 
expell him from the party. 
  Sousa Lennox, current director of the National Association 
of 
Cattlemen (Anagan), will head the Agricultural Development 
Ministry (Mida) as of 1 September when Perez Balladares' 
presidential term begins. 
  Moscoso de Gruber added: "Sousa Lennox believes agricultural 
interests are more important than the interests of the PA, so he 
resigned." 
  Perez Balladares offered the PA two ministries, but the 
Arnulfist leadership forbade its members from occupying posts in 
the incoming government and threatened to expel them from the 
party if they did. 
  According to Gruber, Sousa Lennox's resignation did not 
puzzle or surprise her and she accepted it without demanding an 
explanation. The PA leader said: "He was offered the ministry, 
and we knew he would accept and resign from the party. That is 
why I personally accepted his resignation without delay." 
  Sousa Lennox presented his resignation at the beginning of 
the week, saying that the interests of the agricultural sector 
and of the group of producers he represents are more important 
than his party's zeal.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Hilario Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Panamanian economist Guillermo O. Chapman, Jr. will 
be President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' planning and 
economic policy minister. In exclusive statements to EL PANAMA 
AMERICA, Chapman explained what his first actions will be as 
planning minister. 
  First he will "draw up a current account budget with work 
programs and investments that reflect the priorities of the new 
government. This is an essential instrument for governing, " he 
stressed. 
  Law No.32 of 31 December 1993 established the State General 
Budget at 3.9034 billion balboas, 1.9286 billion balboas of 
which correspond to the central government's budget. 
  "I believe the budget policy must be guided by the objective 
of generating savings in the current account -- in other words, 
more revenue than operational expenses -- so we can use the 
savings to finance the investment program," Chapman said. 
  The central government's 1994 budget plans for 1.4158 
billion 
balboas in current revenue and 512.8 million balboas in capital. 
Of these, 324.3 million balboas will come from external credits 
(IFI's [International Financial Institutions], credits, 
donations from governments and other institutions). 
  Chapman admitted that the reality of this country and of all 
countries is that governments do not have the capacity to 
finance investment programs themselves. "If we want to 
undertake the ambitious investment program that the country 
requires, we need foreign financing. That is inevitable," he 
added. 
  "From a basic standpoint, the country needs to draft its own 
economic plan that emphasizes national priorities based on the 
new government's viewpoint," he said. 
  According to Chapman, "the economic program must serve as a 
guide for the implementation of subsequent budgets and for 
Panama's relations with the IFI." 
  "My intention, and I have spoken about this in detail with 
the president-elect, is to invert the traditional relationship 
that Panama has had with the IFI. Throughout this relationship, 
we have responded to their initiatives rather than to our own," 
the economist added. 
  The new economic plan will bear in mind the positive aspects 
of the current Strategy for the Modernization of the Economy. 
The economist indicated that "perhaps due to the political 
structure of the Endara government, it is an incomplete 
strategy. It lacks some key elements for improving the 
economy's productivity." 
  "For a program to be successful domestically, it must be 
gradual and coordinated. This tells us that so-called shock 
treatments make no sense. I do not believe in that," the 
president of the Investigation and Development Company (INDESA) 
said. 
  A third priority for the future planning minister "is to 
develop, simultaneously with the two previous priorities, a 
social action program organized on a scientific basis with clear 
national objectives. 
  The main ills affecting Panamanians are unemployment and 
poverty. According to official figures, unemployment is at 14 
percent and poverty and extreme poverty affects 50 percent of 
the country. 
  According to Chapman, the initiatives to fight poverty must 
be directed at the poorest sectors while achieving economic 
growth. 
  In the last four years, the Panamanian economy has 
registered 
growth rates of 3.4, 5, 8, and 5.9 percent. Nevertheless, this 
behavior is due to special situations related to the economic 
and political crisis of 1988 and 1989. 
  The future planning minister said "this high growth will not 
be maintained." Nevertheless, the country is sustained by 
strong foreign exchange stemming from mature industries that are 
condemned to slow growth while others will disappear, such as 
the military bases. [sentence as published] 
  "The objective of the economic plan is to achieve 
competitiveness to attract the foreign investments that have not 
come to Panama over the past 10 years. This will generate more 
jobs and improve purchasing power," Chapman said. 
  Asked about the populist and producer-state theories 
promoted 
by the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) in the 1970's, 
Chapman said: "Only God and rocks do not change. Ideas and 
people change." 
  Chapman indicated that privatization is not a panacea. If it 
is not done well, it could create serious problems. 
Privatization is justified when it produces social benefits or 
accomplishes objectives that could not be reached otherwise." 
  A serious obstacle the new administration will face 
beginning 
1 September is the servicing of the commercial debt, which in 
December 1993 reached $1,978,200,725, not including interest, 
which amounts to more than $1.2 billion. 
  "This is a serious problem that must be handled carefully," 
Chapman said. Meanwhile, the negotiating team of the current 
administration is trying to reach an agreement that will benefit 
the country. 
  The economist said educating Panamanians to meet today's 
demands is another priority task. "There is no reason why 
Panamanians cannot have the same productivity as the Japanese, 
Koreans, and Chileans." 
  Chapman told EL PANAMA AMERICA that "there are great 
expectations in the private sector about the opening of specific 
opportunities for investment." 
  "I am very optimistic about Panama's future, even though we 
have such serious problems as the commercial debt, poverty, and 
unemployment. I have accepted the post because I want those 
opportunities to materialize," Guillermo Chapman said.

  [Text] The Colombian-Panamanian Neighborhood Commission 
agreed yesterday to send a note to Enrique Iglesias, president 
of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), creating a 
permanent organization to safeguard the progress of land 
communication between the two countries, an official source 
reported yesterday. 
  According to the source, the IDB committed itself to 
granting 
a nonreimbursable credit for $1.5 million for a study on the 
environmental impact of the construction of a highway linking 
Colombia and Panama. 
  During yesterday's meeting, it was agreed to create a 
banking 
and finance subcommission, and procedures were outlined to 
establish border markings. Also, an immigration agreement will 
be reached to provide documents for 15,000 Colombian immigrants 
who are in Panama illegally. 
  The Neighborhood Commission met for two days on Contadora 
Island for the last talks by Colombian delegates under the 
current government. 
  It was learned that the permanent commission for land 
communication, which will be made up of authorities from both 
countries, will define reference terms for the environmental 
impact study and explore possible sources of financing for the 
highway between Panama and Colombia.

  [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche 20 May (NA) -- The Fourth 
Ibero-American Congress closed its debates today with the 
reading of the final recommendations from each of the four 
commissions in which the congress was divided. 
  The commissions debated the following topics: Commission No. 
1, state reform; Commission No. 2, community law; Commission No. 
3, the three rights and freedoms of the individual; and 
Commission No. 4, technological compatibility. 
  Commission No. 1 recommended that the region's governments 
"should establish the dissemination of information through data 
transmission networks in the fields of education, science and 
technology, economy, health, and justice, thus favoring the 
Ibero-American integration process." 
  In the political-judicial aspect, it recommends "the need to 
promote an overall plan for judicial reform, including the 
development of its overall conversion to data processing, and it 
also must contemplate an adequate training of judicial branch 
magistrates, officials, and employees." 
  It also suggests that it would be convenient to "create a 
permanent development and integration center within the 
administration of justice to apply new technologies with the 
objective of obtaining, classifying, storing, and disseminating 
its facts." 
  The commission that debated community law discussed "the 
scope of the flow of data that crosses borders in relation to 
the rights of the citizen." In this respect, the commission 
stated: "International agreements must attune their ideas to 
prevent unequal legislation in the member countries from 
stopping the inappropriate use of technical practices, thus 
compromising the fundamental rights of the individual." 
  It is recommended that "a community right that contemplates 
the problems of data processing should be quickly implemented" 
within the framework of the Common Market of the South and other 
integration systems. 
  Regarding the rights and freedoms of the individual, it has 
been proposed that "the rights and freedoms of the individual be 
protected against the bad use and abuse of data processing when 
applied to the use of data, thus guaranteeing human dignity." 
  It also has been recommended that "self-determination 
regarding information, when it is understood as the right of the 
individual to control the inclusion and processing of his 
personal data in data banks and its dissemination, will be 
legislated through an express constitutional norm as a 
fundamental right in order to preserve the individual's 
identity, dignity, and freedom." 
  To this effect, it was suggested that "specific legislation 
be approved to regulate, in an overall manner, this right to 
self-determination regarding information." 
  Regarding ethics, the need was proposed "for formulating 
ethical rules of conduct that will include respect for the 
dignity, identity, freedom, and security of the human being, and 
a spirit of cooperation between the world's nations with the 
intention of helping the less developed countries have access to 
knowledge in electronic technology regarding information and 
communication." 
  The recommendation in the field of education points to the 
"incorporation of the tools that offer new technologies in the 
dealing of information in the educational and research processes 
at all levels in Ibero-American countries." 
  Finally, Commission No. 4, harmonizing of technology, 
proposes that "training be given every privilege and that 
universities be given a more active role, including the 
generation of interdisciplinary development and the 
strengthening of research as a service to the community." 
  It has also been recommended that "computers must be made 
easier to use if there is the intention of seeking solutions to 
help with the work of all persons who use computers because it 
is not possible to readapt the tasks on the basis of 
technological solutions if certain users cannot use that 
technology." 
  Some 402 legal experts and specialists from Latin American 
countries, the United States, Spain, France, Italy, and Belgium 
participated in the congress.

<F P=106> [News conference by Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz </F>
and Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz de Vielman 
with unidentified local and foreign reporters at the Foreign 
Ministry in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [Paz] I am honored to introduce to you the ministers 
seated at the main table. From left to right, they are 
Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero; Salvadoran 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria; Belizean Foreign 
Minister Dean Barrow; Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza 
Ruiz de Vielman, spokesperson for the Central American foreign 
ministers; Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo; and 
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez. I will now 
pass the microphone to the Guatemalan foreign minister, who will 
be the spokesperson for this meeting. 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] Good afternoon. As spokesperson for the 
Central American foreign ministers, I welcome the members of the 
media and thank you for your coverage of this event, which is 
very important for the region. 
  We have held a special meeting in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to 
discuss matters of interest for Central America. We have also 
taken this opportunity to discuss subjects we will present 
tomorrow when the Central American presidents meet with U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore in Tegucigalpa. 
  We have discussed topics of special interest for all our 
countries. Specifically, we have discussed an alliance for 
sustainable development. This is a novel and very important 
concept for the region because sustainable development can be 
the axis around which the policies of the governments of the 
region revolve so our countries and the Central American region 
become a pilot plan for sustainable development. 
  We have also discussed trade issues in preparation for 
tomorrow's presidential meeting. We reviewed the possibility of 
receiving the same benefits Mexico receives from the United 
States. This initiative has been discussed in our region, and 
our ambassadors have also reviewed the subject in Washington. 
  Another important point on the agenda is the induction of 
the 
United States as an extraregional member of the Central American 
Development Bank. The fourth subject was the international 
conference for peace and development to be held in Tegucigalpa 
in October. 
  Those are basically the points we discussed, and as always, 
the discussion took place in the usual climate of cordiality and 
cooperation, as is the case with all Central American meetings. 
  [Reporter] I would like to know if you have discussed 
whether Central America will have a unified stand on Haiti. 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] The topic of Haiti was not addressed. We 
did not consider it in our agenda because it is not a regional 
topic. These are topics that would have to be addressed at the 
bilateral level by each country. 
  [Reporter] Could you expand on the issue of commercial 
relations with the United States? What will Honduras' position 
be? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] The Central American region's position is 
one of requesting that the advantages we have under the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative not be harmed in any way by NAFTA. 
For some time, we have been asking the U.S. Government to give 
us the same benefits that Mexico enjoys. This is an initiative 
that has been promoted for some time. These efforts will take 
several months, but we are confident that at some time, we, as a 
region, will enjoy treatment equal to that of Mexico. 
  [Reporter] Do you have any specific data on this 
U.S.-Central 
American alliance? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] Last November, the Central American 
presidents proposed the Alliance for Sustainable Development 
Initiative to President Clinton. We hope to discuss it tomorrow 
with Vice President Gore, as he is well aware of this matter. 
He is even the author of an important book on the subject. 
Sustainable development is a very innovative concept which 
allows governments to streamline their policies for fighting 
poverty, undertake democratization, and deal with other state 
issues within the general context of protecting the environment. 
  [Reporter] What will happen to Salvadorans in the United 
States? There is some concern that the Trifinio Plan will 
create difficult situations for Guatemala and Honduras, as the 
over one million Salvadorans who have to return to the country 
may be relocated there. 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] The foreign ministers' meeting held today 
did not deal with bilateral problems or situations of particular 
states. The Salvadoran immigrant problem is a bilateral issue 
between the United States and El Salvador. 
  [Reporter] Costa Rican President Jose Figueres Olsen has 
[words indistinct] countries which help clean the air must 
receive some benefit for this service to humankind. The 
proposal basically states that countries like the United States 
and Canada, which has pollution-producing companies, must 
compensate countries that favor [words indistinct]. Will you 
discuss this proposal tomorrow? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] We believe that some aspects of 
sustainable 
development policy are technical. In this foreign ministers' 
meeting, we have expressed our government's commitment to adopt 
the philosophy of sustainable development as a guiding policy 
principle. For the time being, we will not refer to specific 
projects or cooperation accords. 
  [Reporter] What should Central America expect from Al Gore's 
visit? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] Central America should expect a [word 
indistinct] dialogue, a dialogue within the framework of 
cooperation and friendship. 
  [Reporter] Central Americans have great expectations for the 
arrival of the U.S. vice president. [Words indistinct] 
sustainable development, but these countries, with an enormous 
foreign debt, earmark large portions of their budget for debt 
payments. [Words indistinct] being taken to make sustainable 
development a reality. 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] Given our limited time tomorrow, some 
important points, such as the one you addressed, will be 
deferred for discussion by technical groups. The issue is 
important, but all our governments will deal with it bilaterally. 
  [Reporter] Will the foreign debt issue be raised with Mr. 
Gore? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] The foreign ministers have not yet reached 
a decision on that. I do not know if the presidents will 
discuss it later. 
  [Reporter] First, will there be any request for special 
treatment for Central America regarding foreign debt payments 
and negotiations with international credit organizations? 
Second, how united is Central America in light of the fact that 
Costa Rica has already begun bilateral negotiations with Mexico? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] Regarding foreign debt negotiations, I 
reiterate [words indistinct] thus far during this meeting, we 
have not decided to discuss this topic. Regarding Central 
American unity, we believe that following recent elections in 
the area, Central America is being strengthened by new leaders 
who favor regional integration and cooperation. We think 
Central America is advancing along the path of integration and 
full cooperation. 
  [Reporter] What about the foreign debt Central American 
countries have with the United States? Would it be possible to 
[words indistinct] with the U.S. vice president to reach a 
solution? Could you tell us more about the peace and 
development plans that will be discussed during the meeting 
[words indistinct] in our country? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] I reiterate: The foreign debt is not on 
the foreign ministers' agenda, but we will consider the many 
questions that have been raised on the matter. As for the peace 
and development meeting in Tegucigalpa, we think it is very 
important because we will discuss topics of great interest to 
everyone. All foreign ministers are making a special effort to 
contribute ideas and work toward the conference. 
  [Reporter] Who prepared the agenda for this meeting with the 
U.S. vice president? Considering Central America's huge foreign 
debt problem, it is inconceivable that this issue was not 
included. 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] The agenda was drafted by the Central 
American technical groups, which arrived in Tegucigalpa two days 
ago. These groups chose regional topics and outlined the agenda 
while taking into account the limited time available on 24 May. 
  [Reporter] Will there be any proposals to reduce the size of 
Central American armed forces since the area is no longer 
plagued by war? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] I reiterate: That topic is not on the 
agenda. We have tried to focus on regional topics excluding 
those issues involving bilateral or individual interests. 
  [Reporter] Since the topics that interest us most are not on 
the agenda, could you be more specific about the Central 
American proposal to the U.S. vice president and sustainable 
growth? What specifically is this proposal about, and what can 
we expect from this meeting with the U.S. vice president? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] The idea of this meeting is not to make 
specific requests concerning the way issues are focused on. The 
idea with regard to sustainable growth is to express to the U.S. 
Government the willingness of the states, individually and as a 
region, to accept the concept of sustainable growth as a 
government objective, which will guide our policies in that 
direction. 
  In addition, we want to tell the United States that we are 
already organizing at the technical level the adequate 
mechanisms that will lay the groundwork for advancing in that 
direction as a region. That will be one of the topics we would 
like to address in the Summit of the Americas at the end of the 
year. For the time being, we want to express our political 
willingness to direct our actions along this path. Above all, 
we will also request parity for area countries within the 
framework of the benefits the United States granted Mexico and, 
at a given time, joining or becoming cosignatories of NAFTA. 
Joining NAFTA would be our second initiative in the commercial 
area. 
  [Reporter] Considering the U.S. vice president's 
environmental background and [words indistinct] in the past 
years of U.S. companies dumping toxic waste in Central America 
or establishing industries that pollute the environment, will 
this issue be discussed with the U.S. vice president? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] Of course. The fact that Central America 
is embracing a philosophy related to sustainable growth 
necessitates a position that will not allow any other country to 
bring polluting industries to the area. This is part of the 
general concept we will discuss as the initiative and as the 
guideline for government policies we will implement. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] total parity or only in a few 
areas? 
  [Ruiz de Vielman] We do not know exactly what will be open 
to 
the region, but we believe it will be partial. We do not know 
what eligibility criteria will be used for such a parity. We 
only have general information, but tomorrow when we make the 
request we are going to try to get the U.S. Government to define 
more clearly the extent of the coverage and the eligibility 
criteria. 
  [Announcer] The news conference held by the foreign 
ministers 
has just ended. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz 
de Vielman has just finished speaking. She is also the 
spokeswoman for this special foreign ministers' meeting.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 May (EFE) -- The holding of a 
runoff election in the Dominican Republic is possible if the 
opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) demands it, 
Manuel Garcia Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board 
(JCE), said today. Nevertheless, the official explained that 
this proposal has not been presented to the JCE. 
  Last night, President Joaquin Balaguer's primary opposition 
in the elections, PRD presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, highlighted the need for "a runoff election" as the "most 
honorable solution" to the Dominican Republic political crisis. 
According to Pena Gomez, "in all of the world's democratic 
nations, when the results of a general election are uncertain, a 
runoff election is held." 
  Garcia Lizado, meanwhile, rejected a PRD request to match 
the 
electoral list with the list of voters delivered to each voting 
table. Faced with the JCE president's refusal, PRD 
representative Leonor Sanchez Baret responded that her party 
would not participate in the revision of 9,528 vote tally sheets 
if the JCE does not first verify the voters lists. 
  The PRD demanded the JCE revise the tally sheets and compare 
the electoral tables' voters lists with the tribunal's list of 
voters, given the alleged manipulation or "displacement" 
[dislocamiento] of names and identification card numbers in 
favor of Balaguer's ruling party, the Social Christian Reformist 
Party. 
  In addition, Pena Gomez made accusations of discrepancies 
between the data issued by the JCE in its bulletins and the 
information contained on the computer disks given to the parties. 
  The PRD has been making accusations of fraud ever since the 
16 May elections, claiming the "displacement" of voters lists, 
from which allegedly more than 200,000 PRD supporters and their 
allies of the so called "Santo Domingo Agreement" were excluded. 
  On Thursday, the JCE stopped the election vote count given 
the PRD and the international observers' demands and pressures. 
  To conclude the vote count, 2.23 percent of the 9,528 
electoral tables distributed in Dominican territory still have 
to be counted. The JCE will also have to review more than 100 
"challenged" and annulled votes before issuing the final results 
of the general elections.

  [Text] The Paraguayan and Romanian Governments yesterday 
agreed to mutually promote and protect investments. 
Representatives of the two countries signed a document at 
Government Palace committing their governments to create 
conditions to encourage investments between the two countries. 
This is one of the main agreements between President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy and Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  Several documents were signed during the last day of the 
official visit by the Romanian mission. The documents refer to 
several bilateral projects between the two nations. The 
agreement for the promotion and protection of investments is 
based on the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment for 
investors, seeking to enhance bilateral economic prosperity. 
  The agreement was signed by Foreign Minister Luis Maria 
Ramirez Boettner and Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  The two governments also established more fluid contacts 
seeking to work out a trade and economic cooperation agreement. 
The idea is to create more favorable conditions for the 
development of trade relations, economic cooperation, and to 
promote and facilitate the exchange of products and services in 
accordance with each country's legislation. 
  Ramirez Boettner and the Romanian foreign minister also 
signed a memorandum of understanding to establish consultation 
mechanisms on aspects of bilateral relations at the top Foreign 
Ministry level. 
  Other bilateral agreements signed refer to cooperation in 
science, education, culture, and sports. 
  The prime minister departed Paraguay at 1230 on 22 May. He 
was seen off by President Wasmosy, ministers, and military and 
civilian authorities.

<F P=106> [From the "180 Minutes of News" Newscast] </F>
  [Text] The National Executive Committee [CEN] of the 
Democratic Action [AD] Party this morning decided to 
exclude--listen carefully: it decided to exclude, which is not 
the same as to expel--Carlos Andres Perez, and it urged the 
National Directors Committee [CDN] to issue an opinion on the 
case. Maria Lilibeth Aponte has the story: 
  [Aponte] Following a seven-hour debate, which ended after 
2300 on 19 May, the AD CEN decided to exclude former President 
Carlos Andres Perez from the party. Some 21 [number as heard] 
CEN members voted in favor of the move, seven voted against it, 
and three others voted for another proposal. The decision was 
made after AD Secretary General Luis Alfaro proposed the 
enforcement of Article 134 of the AD statutes. This article 
stipulates that a lack of moral values or ethics is a serious 
offense and can lead to the permanent expulsion of any member 
who commits one of the crimes listed in the Public Patrimony 
Safeguard Law [ley de salvaguarda de patrimonio publico], 
regardless of whether a domestic court has tried him. 
  Two-thirds of CEN members were required to vote in favor of 
this decision because Perez was a CEN member. Although the word 
expulsion is stipulated in Article 134 of the AD statutes, 
Secretary General Alfaro noted that the former president was 
excluded, not expelled, from the party. The CDN will review the 
CEN decision before making a final decision on the case. 
  [Begin recording] [Alfaro] The statutes stipulate two 
actions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could you expand on this? [words 
indistinct] 
  [Alfaro] There are two actions here. The CEN lacks the 
authority to expel, but it can make exclusions. The CDN, which 
will make its own decision in due time, is the body that decides 
whether to expel. [end recording] 
  [Aponte] Lewis Perez, Aristides Hospedales, Adelso Parra, 
Pedro Tabata Guzman, Oscar Celli, Humberto Celli, Miguel Otero, 
Ixora Rojas, Liliana Hernandez, Carlos Calachin Mata, Armando 
Sanchez Bueno, Octavio Lepage, Lilia Arvelo, and Luis Beltran 
Vallejo all voted in favor of the AD secretary general's 
proposal. Pedro Paris Montesinos, Claudio Fermin, Hector Alonzo 
Lopez, Aura Loretto de Rangel, Luis Emilio Rondon, Antonio 
Ledezma, and Luis Pinerua Ordaz voted against it. Meanwhile, 
union leaders Gaston Vera, Cesar Gil, and Federico Ramirez Leon 
proposed the temporary suspension of Perez, thereby failing to 
compromise their votes.

  [Text] La Paz, 20 May (EFE) -- Today Bolivian authorities 
once again contradicted themselves regarding the alleged 
existence of guerrilla groups linked to drug trafficking and the 
entry of Army troops into the main coca leaf production area in 
Bolivia. 
  While Bolivian Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz 
confirmed 
the military presence in the Chapare to investigate reports on 
the alleged presence of illegal armed groups linked to drug 
trafficking, Bolivian Interior Minister German Quiroga said: 
"There is no such presence (nor) is the Chapare going to become 
militarized." 
  Soliz explained: "A situation that may be the beginning of a 
guerrilla movement has been detected through (Army) 
intelligence. Therefore, military troops must carry out the 
necessary investigations to prevent it." 
  On 17 May, the Army leadership issued a communique 
"categorically" denying press reports on the alleged deployment 
of troops to the Chapare region to "prevent `narco-guerrillas' 
from getting organized." 
  The coca peasant unions rejected the official version, 
stating that the "`narco-guerrilla' is something made up by the 
government to intimidate the region's peasants" and voiced their 
concern over a possible "militarization" of the Chapare. 
  The Bolivian interior minister asserted that reports on 
"narco-guerrillas and militarization" in the Chapare are 
"smokescreens" with which the peasant leaders intend to "save 
their colleagues who were arrested" after drugs were found in 
their homes. 
  Quiroga held the peasants responsible for the version of the 
surfacing of a guerrilla movement linked to drug traffickers and 
the entry of Army troops in the Chapare, where most of the coca 
earmarked for the illegal production of cocaine originates. 
  On 26 April, Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
warned that in the Chapare "there is a climate that could lead 
the drug cartels to a `narco-guerrilla' process." The peasants 
interpreted this warning as an "insult" and reacted by insulting 
the chief of state. 
  According to Quiroga, some coca growers intend to distract 
the peoples' attention from the growing protection they grant 
drug traffickers they supply with illegal coca production. 
  He explained that last weekend, during operations carried 
out 
by drug enforcement forces in the Chapare, maceration pits were 
found on the land of coca growers "and, in the specific case of 
a woman leader, we found 20 kg of drugs in her home." 
  Bolivia is the second-largest coca leaf producer in the 
world 
after Peru, and experts believe it has become the second-largest 
country refining drugs in the world after Colombia.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires. 20 May (NA) -- The trade sanctions 
that might be applied by the U.S. Government against Argentina 
if it does not approve a patents law by 30 June were termed "an 
illegal and illegitimate action" today by Pablo Challu, 
executive director of CILFA [Argentine Industrial Center of 
Pharmaceutical Laboratories]. 
  In a new CILFA onslaught against the U.S. Government, Challu 
said Ambassador James Cheek "is mistaken" when he justifies the 
"threat" of trade sanctions with "the argument that GATT acts a 
reference." 
  While the draft of a new patents law continues without 
resolution in Congress, the pressure of interested groups was 
again refloated this week. 
  In his most recent meetings with the media, Cheek took 
advantage to once again apply the thumbscrews on the topic of 
patents, and on 19 May, after meeting Radical [Radical Civic 
Union] deputies, he warned that trade sanctions "will be 
unavoidable" if the new law is not approved. 
  Meanwhile, CILFA, through its executive director, today 
parried these remarks with an ardent defense of the GATT 
agreement's precepts. 
  "The countries that signed the agreement are not obliged to 
approve patent laws that surpass the norms established in it," 
Challu emphasized. 
  The executive director of the organization that groups 
national laboratories considered it a "mistake" to justify that 
GATT "is a reference point that must be taken into account by 
the countries that must introduce greater protection." 
  This is exactly one of Cheek's justifications to insist that 
Congress approve a law that will favor his country's 
laboratories. 
  To disqualify these justifications, Challu today clarified 
that despite the fact the Article No. 1 indicates that GATT 
members can include complementary protection in their national 
legislation in addition to the protection demanded by the 
agreement, "this cannot violate its precepts." 
  Challu stressed that due to this motive "there is no 
obligation for Argentina to grant those greater concessions." 
  "The unilateral U.S. trade sanctions are an illegal and 
illegitimate action because it is not contemplated in the GATT 
nor in any other international legislation," Challu stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bayrado Arce Castano, member of the </F>
Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN, National Directorate, 
by Radio Sandino Program Director Ada Luz Monterrey in Managua; 
broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Monterrey] ...after two days of deliberations, 
what's your political evaluation of the Special Congress? 
  [Arce] I would say that it has been a very positive exercise 
with significant benefits for the FSLN. I believe that to date 
we have lived up to the expectations of the FSLN grassroots and 
the Nicaraguan people in general. On the one hand, despite many 
predictions, we have been able to handle contradictions and 
opposing views both constructively and positively. We have also 
been able to do it very democratically, to the detriment of the 
right wing, as the recent edition of LA PRENSA indicates. We 
believe that they anticipated bullets and who knows what else 
during the congress. We have been able to hold this important 
debate in a friendly and revolutionary manner that will allow us 
to define precisely the identity of Sandinism. 
  [Monterrey] In this respect, please allow me to interrupt. I 
would like you to expand on this issue. An editorial in today's 
edition of LA PRENSA raises the media issue -- whether it is 
advisable for some FSLN leaders to broadcast their views via the 
right-wing media. Other sectors believe that this is a positive 
sign and that the fact that the FSLN, an opposition party, has 
opened its congress to all representatives of the media should 
be seen as a triumph. As a communications expert, what are your 
comments? 
  [Arce] Before answering I would like to say that -- to the 
right wing's chagrin, as LA PRENSA points out -- we believe that 
far-reaching decisions on the party's democratization and 
transformation are being made here. Nearly half of the members 
of the Sandinist Assembly, the party's leading body, will be 
elected from throughout the country. Women will at a minimum 
make up 30 percent of the party's decisionmaking bodies. There 
are other significant changes: For example, the National 
Directorate will now be elected from within the Sandinist 
Assembly and that mandate [words indistinct] can now be revoked 
by the Sandinist Assembly. The Assembly will also be responsible 
for filling the executive positions not elected by the Congress. 
  This all represents changes in a new, renovated, and 
transformed party. This is the objective of all Sandinists, 
regardless of which side we supported, even among those who 
abstained from involvement with either side. 
  Now, there has been some reference to what is evidently a 
right-wing radio station. I would like to point out the last 
two paragraphs of LA PRENSA's editorial, which are practically 
[word indistinct], nearly childish when they say that it's a lie 
that they are the biggest party, that it's a lie that they are 
going to win in 1996. This sounds like a child's temper tantrum. 
  Now, I believe that the decision to allow the media in 
depends on circumstances. Events like this are open to coverage 
by the right wing. They can cover this because we are very 
open, yet they adopt very arbitrary positions like this one. 
But on other occasions we may find they have very constructive 
opinions. I believe this has a lot to do with the person who 
covers the event, the editor, and on many occasions the 
political angle in covering the story. 
  I will give you an example. Recently several members of the 
Directorate readily agreed to an interview by LA PRENSA's 
Cristiana Chamorro and Ariel Montoya. We assumed that it would 
be a very professional interview. But it turned out not to be 
objective coverage because they did not respect the actual 
content of the interview. Instead they decided to base their 
work on comments that they added; they even misquoted us. I 
recall that I was quoted as saying that efforts for renovation 
were premature and untimely. That is absolute nonsense. I was 
even prompted into calling Cristiana and asking what happened to 
her interview and to remind her that it was very unprofessional. 
I spoke to her as a colleague and as president of BARRICADA. I 
told her that I had assumed that it was going to be a 
professional and mature interview. She gave me some kind of 
explanation. 
  So as you can see, sometimes one decides not to agree to 
interviews because some reporters are very unprofessional or 
highly politicized. Agreeing to an interview is like playing 
their game. But sometimes the reporter seems very professional, 
and we relent, only to end up having our statements misquoted. 
  [Arce] On several occasions statements and positions are 
not only disseminated by one media source but by several, and 
the people are thus made aware of exactly what the interviewee 
said. That specific media that tend to always misquote only end 
up losing credibility in the people's eyes. 
  [Monterrey] To conclude, it is being said that a proposal is 
being prepared by [words indistinct] in the sense of allowing 
the Sandinist Assembly to appoint the directors and editorial 
boards of the Sandinist media. As president of BARRICADA's 
board of directors and president of Radio Sandino's board of 
directors, please give your us opinion on this issue. 
  [Arce] I am not aware that any such proposal has been 
prepared. I am aware that a resolution was approved at the 
Managua consultative assembly proposing that the Sandinist 
Assembly be allowed to elect the editorial boards and boards of 
directors. I believe this initiative is very inadequate and 
does not respond to any logic whatsoever. When the time comes I 
am going to express my opposition. I believe that the most 
logical thing would be to... [pauses] 
  In the past the National Directorate was responsible for 
appointing the editorial boards and the newspaper presidents. I 
believe that this is how it should be. As an executive organ, 
the National Directorate should continue making executive 
appointments. I believe that now more than ever the National 
Directorate must make these appointments, realizing that it is 
not making political appointments but that it is [three-second 
break in reception]. While it may be true that the appointments 
do have some political value, in the final analysis these are 
newspaper enterprises. As such, any appointment must go through 
the logic and framework of a newspaper activity, and the 
criterion that applies is not the same as if a political 
appointment is being made for just a political or party task. 
  [Monterrey] Thank you, Commander Bayardo Arce.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Carlos Reina by Raul Balladares at </F>
the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [Balladares] We are now with President Carlos Reina, 
just hours before the opening of the mini-summit of Central 
American presidents -- a session in which U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore will also participate. 
  Good morning, President Reina. What do you have to say to 
the Honduran people a few hours before this mini-summit gets 
under way? It has been said that Vice President Albert Gore's 
presence is the beginning of a new relationship between Central 
America and the United States. 
  [Reina] Thank you, dear friends, for visiting us at the 
Presidential Palace this morning at a time when we are on the 
threshold of such an important event, namely, the visit of U.S. 
Vice President Albert Gore and the Central American presidents. 
All of us will get an opportunity to speak to this important 
U.S. statesman who enjoys great prestige in his country and 
abroad. 
  I have heard very fitting comments on this visit, comments 
that have significant meaning. This summit means that our 
nation has the democratic conditions and the international image 
required to serve as host of such an important event. Under 
these circumstances, we are preparing for two more summits: the 
Cartagena de Indias summit and the Miami summit. One is the 
Ibero-American Summit, and the other summit has been organized 
by the United States. There have been a number of events 
leading up to this meeting. This meeting is being held in 
Tegucigalpa to enable the Central American presidents to engage 
in an open dialogue with the U.S. official, thereby allowing us 
to extensively review issues prior to the Cartagena de Indias 
and Miami summits. 
  We believe there are basic issues that need to be discussed 
with the U.S. statesman. For example, we must repair the 
damages of a badly administered economy, while at the same time 
we must improve the state's finances. We must also strengthen 
the business sector's capacity, and we must meet the most 
pressing needs of the those people living in poverty who 
comprise the majority in Honduras. To do this, it is imperative 
that the international institutions adopt more flexible 
policies. This is one of the main issues we are going to 
discuss at this Tegucigalpa meeting. 
  As far as the domestic situation is concerned, our position 
is that basically we need a broad consensus of all social and 
economic sectors to implement a [word indistinct] plan in 
Honduras. Therefore, we need the understanding and flexibility 
of the international institutions and friendly nations for this 
transition, at least until the unification plan is fully 
implemented. 
  In preparation for the Tegucigalpa meeting, there was the 
Inter-American Conference for Peace and Development for Central 
America, which was held during the 14th Presidential Summit in 
Guatemala on 29 October 1993. We should reinstate the thesis of 
the Alliance for Sustained Development in which Guatemala and 
Costa Rica have been actively participating. For our part, we 
should strengthen trade, investment, and environmental 
protection. All of these issues will be taken up as part of a 
very full agenda. This is what I can tell you in broad terms 
about this event, of which I am very pleased, because it 
represents trust in the Honduran democratic system. 
  [Balladares] In Switzerland this weekend, the American 
Association of Jurists questioned the IMF about its autocratic 
rule over the world's economies and finances, claiming it only 
wants to help powerful multinational corporations. President 
Reina, are you going to raise this issue with Vice President 
Gore during his visit? Some of your government officials have 
said that these statements by the American Association of 
Jurists might prompt international financial institutions to be 
more flexible, which is something you stressed this morning. 
  [Reina] The news you have just given me agrees with what the 
world currently thinks. The nations that are moving down the 
path toward strengthening democratic systems, as well as facing 
up to macroeconomic variables to achieve healthy economies, must 
not be pressured. With a healthy and prosperous economy, all 
other problems can be resolved. The opinion of the jurists 
agrees with this position. The people of Latin America and the 
world need international financial institutions to display 
flexibility, not impose pressure. With this flexibility, we can 
very well solve difficult situations and strengthen what 
concerns everyone -- namely, human development. During our 
campaign, we gave this policy the name of development with a 
human face. 
  [Balladares] Does this mean you are going to present the 
U.S. 
vice president with these concerns, in other words, that there 
should not be any pressure? Nevertheless, such pressure does 
indeed exist. For example, one form is already being felt, the 
elimination of subsidies and the ensuing higher prices of public 
services in our country. This is part of what these 
international financial institutions are demanding from our 
nation. Will this be raised with the U.S. vice president 
because it is common knowledge that Honduras, at least the 
Honduran people, cannot endure a situation of this nature. 
  [Reina] We are dealing here with two situations. One is to 
be discussed with Vice President Gore and the other involves 
multilateral issues, such as the treaties in which the 
international financial institutions offer assistance to our 
nations. At times, however, when demands must be made, these 
are made with some emphasis. I think the president [as heard], 
all international officials, and all Latin American and world 
leaders know about this situation. What we have to determine 
now is how to resolve this situation. For example, in the case 
of Honduras, we want to avoid the situation we encountered when 
we received the nation amid a general crisis, a crisis that has 
a tendency to worsen. 
  We have halted this tendency. Now we must consolidate a 
very solid and democratic way of life in Honduras. We must make 
deep cultural and educational changes. One of the first steps 
we took in this direction was to strengthen all values of 
civilian society. This has been excellent in clearing the way. 
Also, I believe that economically we must update our 
macroeconomic foundations. This cannot be done quickly. We must 
do this thoroughly and with the efforts of all of the Honduran 
people. 
  I insist that we not allow those who have been hard hit, 
which is the majority of the Honduran people, to be hard hit any 
longer. We are on the path of overcoming this situation. 
  [Balladares] Mr. President, according to many skeptics, 
Honduras is no longer a strategic point for the United States. 
For this reason, these skeptics claim that U.S. assistance is 
being diverted from Honduras. Do you really think that with the 
visit of this important U.S. official, the country can receive 
assistance equal to aid it received in the past or perhaps even 
larger amounts of aid? 
  [Reina] The problem you have raised is much more complicated 
than that. We have left the Cold War behind us. In the Cold 
War, the world's attention was focused on Central America 
because a Cold War was forming in Central America in which the 
two large blocs were testing their strength. In El Salvador 
alone, the United States gave more than $6 billion in military 
assistance. We know now, however, that this situation and this 
world view have disappeared. The two blocs have reconciled, and 
now what is being sought is to improve the people's way of life. 
U.S. assistance that was geared toward a situation of conflict 
has disappeared. Now, we must develop assistance geared toward 
issues such as social problems, improving international 
solidarity, technical assistance, transfer of technology, 
environmental problems, and various forms of international 
cooperation. 
  We cannot continue to permit tactless remarks that say 
Honduras is not fit for investment. I have seen with great 
satisfaction that even the U.S. representative in Honduras, the 
U.S. ambassador, has said that this is wrong and that Honduras 
is indeed a country for investment, a country in which all 
guarantees and securities are provided for anyone wishing to 
invest in Honduras. The world that you refer to has 
disappeared. The new world is based on other premises that are 
more encouraging. 
  [Balladares] Will you ask the U.S. vice president for fair 
access of Central American products in the U.S. market? 
  [Reina] In terms of economics, there are many things that 
will have to be brought up. There is the topic of Central 
America's possible integration into NAFTA. This is a technical 
and extensive topic. Let us recall that Honduras is also a 
member of GATT. Honduras has had a series of setbacks in terms 
of the banana trade. All of these economic topics will have to 
be broached with the U.S. vice president. 
  I think, however, that he is coming to gain awareness of 
what 
is truly happening in Central America. This is the main point 
to which I referred earlier. He is coming to gain awareness and 
to make contact with the presidents of the area in order that 
the resolutions will favor international cooperation, with that 
new human face I mentioned, as well as with that way of 
approaching the people and offering support to democratic 
governments that are making immense efforts to leave their 
historical problems behind. I think this is part of the basic 
objective. 
  The fact that he is coming to Honduras honors us very much. 
When President Kennedy planned to meet with Central American 
presidents, he met them in San Jose, Costa Rica. That was a 
meeting of utmost importance in which Dr. Villeda Morales played 
an important role. Subsequently, President Johnson went to San 
Salvador. That was another era. Today, the Clinton 
administration has selected Tegucigalpa, this dearly beloved 
capital of Honduras, in which we should all be united now to 
request not assistance but, rather, request that we be shown 
understanding and flexibility in finding solutions to our 
problems. 
  [Balladares] Mr. President, because we have a government 
that is conducting a moral revolution and, as you say, a 
government that has a human face, there have been some questions 
about this. As the U.S. vice president arrives in Honduras and 
as we enhance our rapprochement with the U.S. Government in the 
field of economics, specifically in terms of assistance to the 
country, what will the talks you will be undertaking within the 
next few hours consist of? 
  [Reina] U.S. influence in all world organizations is very 
great because the United States is the richest and most powerful 
nation in the world. We demand an understanding that takes our 
efforts into account. As I mentioned earlier -- for example, 
things such as the unification plan, broadening democracy, and 
improving macroeconomic indicators -- the United States must be 
aware of all of these efforts. In addition, our fight against 
corruption, drug trafficking, and poverty as our essential goals 
is something democracies worldwide deem very praiseworthy. 
  [Balladares] Mr. President, Honduras used to be very 
important within the region because of the Nicaraguan war and 
the presence of contras on our soil. This is why Honduras was a 
U.S. strategic location in Central America. In light of what 
you said on 20 May -- that the U.S. vice president's arrival 
necessarily underscores the great importance of our country -- 
why is Honduras regaining importance? By virtue of the fact 
that Honduras was chosen as the site of the meeting, is this an 
unusual visit? What is the message of the visit? 
  [Reina] I want to speak openly. Within the framework of the 
Cold War, Honduras played a sad and very bitter role because of 
the presence of counterrevolutionary forces involved in the 
Central American war. Honduras' image was very negative then. 
Today, however, just the opposite is true. Honduras was chosen 
to host this Central American presidents meeting to discuss the 
two upcoming summits -- again, the Cartagena de Indias and Miami 
summits. This reflects the strategic importance of Honduras. 
Also, Honduras has become a democratically strategic location 
in strengthening the values that serve as democratic 
foundations, and, in turn, this improves the image of Honduras 
within the United States and the world community. I believe I 
heard this stated in the Tegucigalpa media. We must understand 
this concept and welcome the international community's 
recognition of the democratic system currently reigning in 
Honduras. 
  [Balladares] Mr. President, in a weekend meeting of some 
Armed Forces chiefs, the (Trifinio) Plan was made public by 
Colonel Claudio Lainez Coello, who views the opening of the 
border with suspicion because it may ultimately hurt the nation. 
What is your opinion on this? 
  [Reina] Opening the borders is a delicate, yet inevitable, 
process within the framework of integration. We must learn to 
live peacefully and democratically in Central America. This 
poses new risks. As for the (Trifinio) Plan, I flatly oppose 
its so-called shared sovereignty. It was unacceptable before 
the demarcation of the borders because it could misrepresent the 
jurisdiction of each state. After the borders were demarcated 
by the highest world court, their redemarcation became 
imperative. Then, the states will be able to reach special 
agreements for the development of the area. This situation is 
not only relevant to the (Trifinio) Plan, but also to the 
Fonseca Gulf. The disputation of sovereignty issues by others, 
however, is something that must unite all Hondurans in order to 
defend our interests, interests that must not hinder regional 
development. 
  [Balladares] As for domestic issues, over the weekend it was 
reported that you had decided to dismiss a top tourism official. 
It sounded like speculation, and we are lacking an official 
report. I would like to know if you have any official report? 
  [Reina] Special commissions are currently investigating the 
latest cases in Tourism, Honduran Corporation for Forest 
Development, and Customs. These commissions will issue their 
reports in due time. I want to view this situation very 
positively, however. Should there be any irregularities, the 
Honduran people will be informed. The Honduran media have 
played a key role in this. This is part of the fight against 
corruption; it is a barometer for the new system. 
  In the past, we refused to talk about corruption until it 
was 
impossible to control it. Today, we all act on it as soon as we 
encounter it, as soon as the first symptom arises. I believe it 
is important for each case to be properly studied. This 
constitutes the basis for many cases whose resolutions will be 
made public in accordance with the duties of a responsible 
government.

  [Text] Brasilia, 19 May (EFE) -- Today, official sources 
announced here that the governments of Brazil and Germany will 
continue the construction of the Angra-2 nuclear plant on the 
Rio de Janeiro coastline despite the protests of the Greenpeace 
environmental organization. 
  Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko recommended to 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco that construction work, which 
was halted several years ago, be resumed at the Angra-2 site. 
  Three-fourths of Angra-2's construction has been completed, 
and the German Government and banks have offered loans to 
finance the remaining one-fourth of the project. Mines and 
Energy Ministry sources noted that it would be cheaper to 
complete the plant's construction than "to render the 
investments already made there useless." German Embassy sources 
noted that to backtrack at this point would cost as much as to 
finish the plant. 
  In light of the Brazilian commitment to make peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, reflected in a number of treaties recently 
ratified by Congress, the German Embassy has noted that the Bonn 
government is in favor of continuing the project. 
  Brazil signed an agreement on nuclear safeguards with 
Argentina. After approving some new amendments, it has also 
ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes atomic weapons 
in Latin America, and has agreed to allow the inspection of its 
installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Following the end of the racist regime, the 
Brazilian Government expects to increase trade relations with 
the Republic of South Africa [RSA]. Before the consolidation of 
the democratic government of Nelson Mandela, relations between 
Brazil and the RSA were not very good because the Brazilian 
Government opposed the racist apartheid regime. Now that it is 
gone, it is expected that trade relations between the two 
countries will triple in the next five years. This was reported 
by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim: 
  [Begin Amorim recording] Without doubt, our trade potential 
with the RSA is very big. This potential was repressed on 
account of the sanctions against the RSA and our own opposition 
to the apartheid regime. Now, with a majority government and a 
fully democratic government elected by the people's votes, our 
expectations have improved enormously, mainly because the RSA's 
economy will undergo important transformations that probably 
will open new business opportunities. [end recording] 
  The Brazilian Government has invited RSA President Nelson 
Mandela to visit Brazil this year. The RSA Government however, 
has yet not officially confirmed Mandela's visit to Brazil.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 20 May (EFE) -- Official sources 
reported here today that the Brazilian Government will start 
negotiations with Canada regarding the alleged "dumping" (unfair 
trade practice) charges brought against Canada by the United 
States and Argentina concerning Canadian wheat sales to Brazil. 
The sources said Brazil plans to exhaust negotiations with 
Canada before proceeding to open a formal investigation. 
  The United States and Argentina have charged that the 
Canadian Government has subsidized its wheat and, therefore, its 
price has become more competitive than U.S. and Argentine wheat 
on the Brazilian market, which will need to import 5 million 
metric tons of wheat this year. 
  Brazilian wheat producers have demanded that the Brazilian 
Government investigate the charge that Canadian wheat might be 
subsidized. 
  A Brazilian Government official said: "We are going to 
exchange ideas (with Canada), but we do not intend to formally 
start an `antidumping' investigation." [passage omitted]

Tapias, president of the Brazilian Federation of Banks 
(Febraban), said Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidential 
candidacy "may be one of the factors that caused foreign debt 
certificates to drop." 
  These certificates, which were issued by the Brazilian 
Government, have a nominal value of $100. On 4 May, they were 
negotiated for $74 and on 17 May their value dropped further to 
$67. 
  Tapias could not forecast the position banks will adopt if 
the certificates' value continues to drop. He said he has no 
data on the amount of these certificates still in the hands of 
the national banks.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 20 May (AE) -- Today, former 
Minister Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, president of the 
Association of Brazilian Exporters (AEB), announced that the AEB 
is starting a national campaign to make the Senate approve the 
new patents law. In his opinion, upon signing the GATT Uruguay 
Round accord, Brazil assumed international commitments "that now 
must be reflected in the country's laws on intellectual 
property." Pratini said: The draft law, which has been in the 
Senate for almost a year now, must now be approved so Brazilian 
commercial interests on the international front "will not again 
become the target of threats of protectionist or retaliatory 
measures as a result of the isolated Brazilian position in the 
patents area." 
  Pratini reported that the executive branch has just 
submitted 
to the Senate new suggestions for amendments relating to the 
GATT agreements signed by the country and criticized the delay 
in resolving the issue. Because of this, he said, "in 10 years, 
China has already tripled its exports compared to those of 
Brazil." He added that, because of inadequate legislation, 
Brazil is already losing trade opportunities in the area of high 
technology, in addition to leaving itself open to trade 
sanctions, such as the case of newsprint from 1989 to 1991. 
These sanctions provoked a $300 million loss for Brazilian 
exports and the loss of markets, like that of the United States, 
which have never been regained." [quotation marks as received]. 
  Pratini added that the AEB also is alerting the government 
about the problems a fixed exchange rate will cause for 
exporters. He said: "We pointed out the need to reduce some 
taxes bearing on exports as a way to compensate the Brazilian 
foreign trade sector for the losses it may sustain as a result 
of the freeze in the exchange rate during the initial stage of 
the real." In his opinion, the market recognizes that it is 
essential to have a fixed exchange rate during the first stage, 
but "the problems experienced with the Cruzuado Plan, which 
provoked a sharp drop in exports and a large increase in 
imports, must be avoided." Pratini added: "Both exports and 
imports must increase." AEB, which consists of 900 companies, 
accounts for 98 percent of Brazilian exports.

da Silva's program to fight unemployment is ready. It 
contemplates creating 8 million new jobs in the next four years. 
The Workers Party (PT) leadership is keeping this program 
secret. It was prepared so as not to depend on legal or 
constitutional changes and use resources that already exist, 
although the PT leaders believe said resources have been badly 
distributed. The program, which is entitled "Impact Plan Against 
Unemployment," will cost nearly $25 billion. These funds will be 
obtained from social and constitutional funds in addition to 
budget allocations. 
  The plan is coordinated by Deputy Aloizio Mercadante and has 
been drafted by five economists linked to the PT. It is divided 
into three lines of action: the creation of jobs, assistance to 
unemployed people, and active job policies. The program will 
reassign funds from the Workers' Assistance Fund and the 
Severance Payment Fund, among others, to investment in the 
fields of civil construction, agriculture, agro-industry, and 
tourism. The PT economists believe these fields to be the most 
adequate ones for creating jobs. 
  One of the economists responsible for the program said: We 
will be using the funds that have financed the sugar and alcohol 
industry without ever benefiting those who work in the field 
better. They continued to be temporary workers, itinerant rural 
workers, and miserable. 
  According to him, the companies that evade taxes or do not 
transfer Severance Payment Fund contributions to the government 
will be left out of all benefits. 
  The idea is to create an data processing system that places 
information at the disposal of the Ministries of Labor, Social 
Security, and Health and makes it possible for these ministries 
to exchange data, thus revealing discrepancies. 
  The agricultural cooperatives, the labor cooperatives, and 
the micro enterprises, which are destined to absorb large 
contingents of workers, will be favored when funds are 
allocated. PT studies indicate that as a result of 
ever-increasing production automation, industries such as 
chemical laboratories and car-manufacturing companies no longer 
create jobs in Brazil. In view of their economic importance, 
however, these industries will not be abandoned. 
  The economist added: We believe there is a social emergency. 
If nothing is done in this regard, there will be 14 million 
unemployed people in the country in four years, and we will be 
sitting on a powder keg. He believes low-quality jobs must be 
created in massive numbers and at an speedy pace in order to 
absorb unqualified labor. 
  In addition to financing machinery and equipment for 
cooperatives, the program contemplates the establishment of 
enterprise nurseries, which are common in Italy and Spain; 
hangars equipped with infrastructure in which the 
micro-entrepreneurs do not pay rent and contribute to the 
government only by paying taxes on their activities.

<H5>  Who Wins </H5>
  From January 1990 to March 1994, the stock exchanges, which 
were refilled by foreign investors, have demonstrated that the 
Brazilian public companies, en masse, experienced the greatest 
benefits from private investments. 
<H5>  A Horror </H5>
  During that period, the amount of state companies with 
shares 
listed on the stock exchange jumped from 29 to 46. Their total 
market value jumped from $10 billion to $74 billion. And their 
participation in the value of all the negotiated shares 
increased from 22 percent to 56 percent. 
<H5>  Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] </H5>
  The apple in the eyes of investors then, Telebras's 
performance skyrocketed on the exchange floor: Its market value 
went from a feeble $470 million to a vigorous $13 billion. Did 
the Workers Party know about this? 
<H5>  Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc.] </H5>
  Just as monopolistic as Telebras, Eletrobras also overcame 
its misery. During the same period, the value of its shares rose 
from $910 million to $14.5 billion. 
<H5>  Who Loses </H5>
  The volume of Brazilian shares controlled by foreign 
institutional investors amounts to approximately $13 billion. If 
they decided to sell as a result of PT threats, the public 
companies' share value will suffer enormous losses.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 May (ABE) -- Today, Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero clarified his position regarding the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. "It was neither aggressive 
commentary nor political sociology," said Ricupero, who avoided 
repeating the criticism he made of the party. On 20 May in 
Porto Alegre, Ricupero said he was not campaigning for the PSDB 
because he is a critic of the PSDB, which he compared to "a gay 
who has not dared come out of the closet." 
  "I made a commentary in the hallway, but it was friendly," 
Ricupero said. This time he praised the PSDB cadres. According 
to him, Senator Mario Covas (PSDB-Sao Paulo) was the one who 
best interpreted his words. "I can only say that I made them in 
a friendly tone," he added. Ricupero recalled his comments 
often get out of proportion because he is a professor. 
"Professors tend to be dramatic."

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 20 May (AE) -- Former Sao Paulo Governor 
Orestes Quercia, presidential candidate of the Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party [PMDB], today met in his campaign 
headquarters with two incumbent governors and five former 
governors of his party to officially announce that Iris Rezende 
will be his running mate on the PMDB ticket. She is the wife of 
former Goias Governor Iris Rezende -- both husband and wife have 
the same name. The ticket will be approved by the PMDB national 
convention to be held in Brasilia on 22 May. 
  Quercia said he chose Mrs. Iris Rezende because he was 
determined from the outset to have a woman as his running mate 
as a way of paying tribute to all Brazilian women.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia, 20 May (AE) -- Today, Senator Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao 
Paulo] took another step toward obtaining former President Jose 
Sarney's support for his presidential candidacy. Deputy 
Zequinha Sarney (PFL-MA) [Liberal Front Party-Maranhao State), a 
son of Sarney, has been asked to join the political council of 
the "Union, Work, and Progress" coalition campaign. The 
coalition consists of the PSDB, PFL, and Brazilian Labor Party. 
As part of his strategy to earn Sarney's support, Cardoso is 
planning to announce soon his support for the continuation of 
the North-South railway project, an unfinished Sarney project. 
[passage omitted] 
  On 18 May, Cardoso and Senator Guilherme Palmeira 
(PFL-Amapa), the coalition's candidate for vice president, met 
at the plenary session room of the Chamber of Deputies with 
Deputy Roseana Sarney (PFL-MA), Sarney's daughter and candidate 
for governor of Maranhao State. She conditioned her father's 
group's support for Cardoso to a political agreement in 
Maranhao, where the PSDB is planning to enter into a coalition 
with Senator Epitacio Cafeteira (Popular Renewal Party), her 
opponent in the Maranhao gubernatorial race. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Porto Alegre, 20 May (AE) -- Today, Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero responded to allegations that he is campaigning 
for the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] by defending the 
economic program formulated by Senator Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, the former finance minister and current PSDB 
presidential candidate. Ricupero said: "I am not campaigning for 
the PSDB. I am not linked to any party. Rather, I am a critic 
of the PSDB." He added that the "PSDB is like a gay who has not 
dared come out of the closet, as the Americans say. The PSDB 
has sometimes failed to assume its role." 
  Ricupero even compared the PSDB to the old UDN [National 
Democratic Union]. He said: "Although the PSDB has good 
members, it is, like the UDN, a center party despite their 
thinking it is a leftist party." He made these remarks with a 
broad smile while mingling with approximately 100 businessmen at 
the Rio Grande do Sul State Federation of Industries (FIERGS). 
  Under the watchful eye of FIERGS President Dagoberto Godoy, 
Ricupero said he had "nothing against gays," and even confessed 
to having a "gay friend." He drew the above comparison in 
simple terms, and went on. He added: "No one can charge me with 
campaigning for the PSDB. My son, who is with the Workers 
Party, likes Antonio Gramsci," the Italian leftist ideologist. 
In his opinion, the electoral campaign is focusing on the 
personality of the candidates instead of on their government 
programs. 
  Ricupero, who also questioned the manner in which the 
electoral campaign is being conducted, said: "All we are hearing 
is that Cardoso is this way, while Lula is that way, but no one 
is talking about their programs." He added: "It is a mistake to 
believe we will be electing a president who will have powers 
similar to those of Juscelino Kubitschek or Janio Quadros. At 
that time, presidents had full powers." Ricupero said the 
situation "has changed radically, as we have a parliamentarist 
constitution for a presidentialist system." 
  Ricupero defended the parliamentary system. Without 
mentioning Cardoso's name, he said "the ideal thing" would be to 
elect a candidate capable of promoting alliances. "If the 
winner does not have a majority in Congress and cannot promote 
alliances, he will not be able to rule," he said. He cited the 
case of former President Fernando Collor, noting that "Collor 
did not manage to stay in power, let alone rule."

  [Text] A Gallup poll conducted in the first fortnight of 
May shows that Workers Party presidential candidate Luiz Inacio 
Lula da Silva continues to lead the race for the presidency. 
With former president and incumbent Senator Jose Sarney 
(PMDB-AP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Amapa] out of the 
race, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who will stand as the Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party [PSDB] candidate in the presidential 
elections, is consolidating his position as runner-up in the 
public opinion poll. According to the Gallup poll, 38 percent of 
the people would vote for Lula while 23.5 percent would vote for 
Cardoso. 
  The survey, published exclusively by O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO, 
was conducted among 2,200 voters in 143 cities in 22 states 
between 3 and 13 May. This was before Sarney decided not to run 
for the presidency, but his name already had been crossed off 
the list of the possible candidates submitted to those polled. 
The survey shows that support for Lula's candidacy has increased 
considerably since he had 31.7 percent in April. Nevertheless, 
this support is still not sufficient to guarantee his victory in 
the first round of the election. According to the Gallup poll, 
Lula's opponents together garner 43.4 percent of the vote. 
  Cardoso's popularity has also improved a little. He had 20.2 
percent in April. During a month in which he did not campaign 
and spent most of the time in Brasilia trying to consolidate the 
alliance that will field him as candidate, voters' support for 
him rose from 11.9 percent to 17.9 percent in the northeast. 
The main target of the alliance between the PSDB and the PFL 
[Liberal Front Party] is to attract votes from the northeast. 
Cardoso's candidacy is now weaker in the south. 
  Lula, who has been canvassing the country's interior for 
more 
than a year, fared best in the northeast, where 49.7 percent of 
voters considered him their choice for president. His weakest 
support was in the north and center-west regions, where he 
obtained 34.7 percent. It was precisely in those regions where 
Lula and his retinue spent more time on the stump. According to 
the Gallup poll, he now has 40.3 percent of the vote in cities 
with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. 
  The other presidential candidates continue to fare poorly. 
They all obtained better results in the public opinion poll, 
but they still cannot muster 10 percent of the voters' support. 
Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party], Orestes Quercia 
(PMDB), Esperidiao Amin (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party], and 
Flavio Rocha (PL) [Liberal Party] together got 19.9 percent of 
the vote. Unlike Lula, who entered an alliance with five small 
leftist parties, and Cardoso, who formed a coalition with the 
PFL and the Brazilian Labor Party, these four candidates will 
run for the presidency on their own. 
  Cardoso only outstrips Lula among voters in the higher 
income 
bracket: Within Class A, he received 49.9 percent of the vote 
and within Class B, 34.3 percent. He is at Lula's heels among 
voters who are older than 50 and fares better in medium-sized 
cities than big cities. There is a considerable number of 
undecided voters: 18.3 percent of voters still are undecided 
about who to vote for or do not like either candidate.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 May (AE) -- The Fifth National CUT 
[Sole Workers Central] Congress, which ended in Sao Paulo today, 
became a big party in support of PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Officially, however, CUT 
will not support Lula, based on a vote by members from almost 
all the regions. Except for the "Workers Cause" faction, which 
accounted for less than 1 percent of representatives at the CUT 
Congress, the other leftist factions agreed to elect a single 
ticket, on which Vicente Paulo da Silva, also known as 
"Vicentinho," was elected CUT president. 
  The slogan at the plenary session was "Lula president, CUT 
independent." At the end of the congress the approximately 
2,000 delegates signed a statement of support for Lula. 
  Lula will begin his campaign in the CUT grassroots on 23 
May. 
Early in the morning, he will seek votes at the Volkswagen and 
Scania plants from a loudspeaker-fitted truck of the Union of 
Metalworkers of the Sao Paulo industrial belt. The CUT, as an 
organization, will not support him, but unions and leaders have 
been authorized to decide whether or not to use the CUT 
structure. Direct financial help was prohibited. The delegates 
did not approve the creation of a Pro-Lula Workers Fund, which 
was aimed at raising funds for the campaign, on behalf of the 
CUT. 
  The last day of deliberations was devoted almost entirely to 
political affairs and the designation of members of the single 
ticket. The executive board, with 25 full members, will have 14 
members of the Coordination faction, which is the most moderate 
sector, to which Vicentinho belongs. The other posts were 
filled by members of more radical leftist groups: four from the 
Union Class Movement, two from the CUT grassroots faction, and 
two from the Unified Social Workers Party. The Work, Marxist 
Trend, and Socialist Force factions won one position each. The 
Coordination faction increased its participation with respect to 
the previous CUT congress, when 13 of its members were 
designated to the executive board. This will make Vicentinho's 
job easier because he intends to negotiate agreements for 
several sectors, based on the agreement reached in the car 
manufacturing sector. 
  Lula, who attended the closing reception, praised the new 
CUT 
president's willingness to negotiate. "The change has improved 
CUT," he said, adding that "Vicentinho conveys confidence to the 
public, and has the flexibility to negotiate and search for a 
consensus."

<F P=106> [News conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon </F>
Carpio upon arriving in Honduras to attend a meeting of Central 
American presidents, with unidentified reporters; at the Hernan 
Acosta Mejia Air Force Base in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [De Leon] We, the Central American presidents, are 
very excited to be here, where we will try to unify our 
positions and prepare the agenda for the hemispheric summit -- 
the so-called Summit of the Americas -- which will be held in 
the United States at the end of the year. The idea is precisely 
to unify the proposals, our proposals, proposals to be presented 
by each nation. The idea is to present in a unified manner 
diverse issues, including environmental issues, on which a 
proposal has already been drawn up by all of the Central 
American presidents. I had the honor of presenting to President 
Clinton the proposal for a sustained alliance, an Alliance for 
Sustained Development. This is a pilot program for Central 
America to strengthen our democracies based on absolute liberty, 
based on a true democracy, and based on respect for human 
rights, such as the right to a clean environment. 
  There is also the drug trafficking issue, and drug-related 
activities, which generally includes several other issues. 
There is also the free trade issue, which has taken the form of 
NAFTA. We will attempt to unify standards in an attempt to 
present a single point of view at the upcoming meeting on this. 
  [Reporter] What [words indistinct] NAFTA in Guatemala? 
  [De Leon] We have been studying this. We have presented a 
proposal to the United States. Every president has already 
appointed and designated two representatives each, and these 
representatives are already working on this. We hope this 
process will develop little by little until a hemispheric free 
trade agreement is achieved. This was the proposal the 
presidents made to President Clinton in November. Of course, to 
achieve this we must overcome several problems. Our [words 
indistinct] our goal is to achieve integration, although we 
understand that integration into this free trade agreement will 
be a slow process. 
  [Reporter] This is a historic moment for the democracies of 
Central America. The Guatemalan Government has entered into 
negotiations with the Guatemalan guerrillas. What are the 
chances these negotiations will ultimately put an end to this 
conflict, which is the last armed conflict to prevail in the 
region? 
  [De Leon] Tomorrow will be exactly one year since former 
President Serrano Elias attempted to interrupt the institutional 
and constitutional order. This is one of the main reasons why I 
assumed the presidency of the Republic. Now, one year later, we 
can highlight two fundamental changes that have taken place. 
  In institutional matters one year later, we can say with 
satisfaction that Guatemala has guarded and strengthened its 
institutionality. Today, more than ever, any possibility of 
interrupting institutional order has been removed. Now, more 
than ever, there is no talk of a coup d'etat in Guatemala, and 
the principles of institutionality have been strengthened and 
preserved and, in turn, so has the democratic process. 
  Meanwhile, when I assumed the Presidency nearly one year 
ago, 
we encountered a dialogue that had broken down; the entire 
process was totally bogged down. Now we are nearing peace 
[words indistinct] to sign peace. Today -- and this is the 
reason I was delayed -- we were engaged in direct communication 
with the Peace Commission that is discussing the displaced 
communities issue. We are on the verge of resolving this point, 
while we are [words indistinct] the aspect we have already 
agreed upon on a timetable that will conclude with a cease-fire 
in September. In certain regions, there could be cease-fires 
before this time. This would conclude with the signing of a 
peace pact that puts an end to an armed conflict -- the last 
one, as you just noted -- which has been going on for more than 
33 years. 
  [Reporter] What was the U.S. reaction to the proposal you 
presented in the name of the Central American presidents? 
  [De Leon] At that time, it was very well-received. I believe 
this is the time to test the world power that is our neighbor 
and which, to some extent, is committed to these issues not only 
because of a commitment to the nations of Central America, but 
also because of its commitments to its own population. For 
example, environmental issues as well as drug-related 
activities, adversely affect not only the Central American 
population, but they also affect the U.S. population and the 
world population. Therefore, this proposal was very 
well-received, and we hope that today we can wrap up this point 
and take it to the upcoming summit with... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President will this meeting 
serve to somehow establish a bilateral relationship with 
Honduras? 
  [De Leon] We have embarked on an excellent relationship with 
President Reina, and I believe that this is a good opportunity 
to discuss bilateral issues, even through this may be in a very 
quick manner. We will be meeting on 31 May in San Salvador, but 
there are issues we can discuss, such as the supply of 
electricity. We could offer Honduras a certain amount of 
megawatts, which would enable us, when the network is created, 
to supply a certain amount of electricity. Right now, this is a 
difficult issue for Honduras. We undoubtedly could discuss this 
and other issues, particularly in light of the excellent 
relationship all of the Central American nations currently have, 
and all presidents have, including the new presidents. 
  [Reporter] What about the travel advisory issued to U.S. 
citizens in the wake of the high level of violence and attacks 
against U.S. citizens? Has this situation improved? Why is 
this situation occurring? 
  [De Leon] As Guatemalan President and as a representative of 
the Guatemalan people and its government, I believe this was a 
very drastic decision; it was much too extreme on the part of 
the world power, the United States. In the United States 
itself, incidents such as those that have occurred in my country 
are also taking place against citizens from other nations. 
There are murders, violence, and others incidents. 
Nevertheless, although I respect it, I do not agree with this 
drastic decision. It is unjustified because, although in 
Guatemala we are currently experiencing a climate of violence 
like many other parts of the world, conditions do not exist to 
justify the travel warning [preceding two words in English]. 
Nevertheless, we are making an all-out effort to convince the 
United States that conditions do not prevail to continue with 
this warning in the hope of returning tourism to the nation. 
  [Reporter] But what is the reason for this situation? 
  [De Leon] It has been brought about by violent situations 
that have taken place in all countries of the world. There have 
been two or three cases. There were charges of trafficking in 
children, and these were untrue. Nevertheless, two or three 
U.S. citizens have been accused, as well as two or three other 
foreigners. Nevertheless, conditions do not prevail to justify 
the travel warning [preceding two words in English].

  [Text] Montevideo, 20 May (AFP-NA) -- The directors of the 
Argentine, Brazilian, and Uruguayan state banks met today in 
Montevideo to accelerate the region's financial integration 
process with an eye to establishing the future Common Market of 
the South (Mercosur). 
  Executives from the Argentine Bank of the Nation, the Bank 
of 
Brazil, and the Bank of the Uruguayan Republic participated in 
the meeting, according to officers of the Uruguayan bank. 
  The meeting had the mission of "evaluating the application 
of 
mutual cooperation agreements that will permit an effective 
financial integration of the countries that will be a part of 
Mercosur," according to a communique issued by the Uruguayan 
banking authorities. 
  "The mutual granting of lines of financial credit to promote 
the subregion's exports, actions to promote trade within 
Mercosur, and credit support for enterprises that run their 
activities from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay" were among the 
topics that were evaluated. 
  The three Southern Cone countries and Paraguay will, as of 
1995, implement a free trade zone in which financial activities 
will be increased with a greater flow in the exchange of 
services and assets. 
  During the meeting that was held in Montevideo, with the 
absence of Paraguay, it was agreed to promote the "exchange of 
technical and normative information between the state financial 
institutions and to advance in the field of banking technology 
cooperation," according to the communique.

<F P=106> [Speech by Army General Raul Castro, minister of the </F>
Revolutionary Armed Forces, FAR, to close the plenum of FAR's 
national committee of civilian workers; date and place not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear Comrades: As I said earlier, I will be brief. 
We have always believed that the endeavors of the union of 
civilian workers of the FAR are not only compatible with the 
principle of a unified command but are also an irreplaceable 
tool to an army such as ours, the Cuban people in uniform. The 
fact that this union has had a productive existence of over two 
decades, and the accomplishments of this last period that you 
have summarized and studied in depth at this meeting, confirm 
our conviction. 
  At a recent FAR military council, I termed colossal the work 
carried out and the results achieved over the past three years 
by the FAR. Thanks to these achievements, the special period has 
not reduced our capabilities or our combat-readiness. The abrupt 
cutoff of Soviet supplies and the drastic reduction of resources 
allocated from the national economy did not intimidate us, nor 
did it render us content to remain as we were. Had we not 
drafted plans to resist a military blockade in case of war? Was 
that an exercise in rhetoric, or did it express our commitment 
to confront the worst, resist, and triumph? We tackled the 
special period in peacetime with the same commitment with which 
we would have shouldered the hard trials of war. 
  The unbelievably difficult situation was a foothold for 
strengthening the concept of the War of the Entire People and 
redoubling efforts, unleashing creative initiatives, and 
encouraging the boldness of millions of patriots involved in 
defense tasks in different ways. Among these are the civilian 
workers of the FAR and their union. You deserve part of the 
credit, and it pleases us to say so at this meeting with the 
national committee of the civilian workers of the FAR. 
  What has been accomplished should never cause us to become 
smug or complacent, for what remains to be done exceeds what has 
been done. It is true that our food production has been growing 
at an annual rate of 30 percent. We should not decrease the rate 
of growth, however, until we achieve full self-sufficiency in 
food for our troops and civilian workers. What's more, we ought 
to produce enough to be able to allocate a modest amount of food 
and other essential products to the families of career military 
and civilian cadres. We are not satisfied with what we have 
attained. We will try to provide more each day to every member 
of the FAR, including, as is logical, its civilian workers. 
  Every one of us has to become convinced that every component 
will have what it is able to attain through its efforts. Work, 
the only source of wealth, ought to be the main factor 
determining who will have more, and who will have less, food, 
high-demand items, and services of every kind. Parallel to this 
in-house effort to free up resources previously allocated to us 
by the national economy, we have the growing efforts of the 
Youth Labor Army, its members, and its laborers at the 
self-contained farms, who struggle to produce food for the 
population in the savannas and mountains: in sugarcane and 
coffee fields; and production of tubers, vegetables, grains, and 
citrus. This is an extraordinary contribution, as the demand for 
a labor force reaches its peak. 
  The officers and soldiers of regular units, and Camilitos 
and 
civilian workers from military schools and academies, are also 
marching to the fields. A good example of this is the Labor Feat 
banner just received from Comrade Pedro Ross, secretary general 
of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], by a detachment that, 
representing the FAR, worked in the fields in Pinar del Rio and 
Havana Provinces. The task of reshaping and perfecting the 
structure of the FAR, which we have undertaken in order to bring 
it into line with our economy's current possibilities, could not 
have been achieved in such a short period of time and with such 
quality without the full support of every soldier and civilian, 
from the generals to the soldiers and from the union leaders to 
the very last worker. 
  We are not deceiving ourselves, nor are we trying to deceive 
the enemy, when we affirm that we are today more powerful and 
undefeatable because we rely on our own resources and have 
developed and strengthened the doctrine of the War of the Entire 
People. We are not the armed forces with the most active 
resources. Nevertheless, we can affirm that we have the 
best-prepared armed force on the continent, and therefore the 
one with the most vitality, the one capable of emerging from the 
bowels of the earth following massive surprise air raids and 
making any enemy trying to invade Cuba pay an immense price. Any 
invaders who, at an elevated cost, might manage to occupy 
portions of our territory will feel the earth shake beneath 
their feet. 
  They would have not a single moment of respite. 
  A hornet's nest of millions of men and women fighting in 
every corner of the fatherland would force them to desist from 
such a criminal attempt, take their tens or hundreds of 
thousands of casualties, and learn, finally, that anyone trying 
to take over Cuba, will harvest the dust of its soil drenched in 
blood, or die in the struggle, as General Antonio Maceo once 
warned on behalf of Cuba and for all time. 
  During the same period that we worked at the aforementioned 
tasks, other no less important or difficult tasks have been 
carried out, such as preserving and maintaining equipment and 
weapons and preparing the theater of military operations. In 
these tasks, the contributions of the civilian workers of the 
FAR and all workers nationwide, through the National Association 
of Innovators and Efficiency Experts and the Technical Youth 
Brigades, have been significant. 
  The CTC and its unions have worked systematically at 
mobilizing workers to build people's tunnels. They have done 
this quietly. The number of kilometers they dig every day in the 
soil of the fatherland to ensure that it will always be free and 
sovereign are figures we do not publicize. However, we can 
publicize and stress this: Over 30 million pesos are donated 
annually to support the Territorial Troops Militia. How noble 
are today's workers, the historical heirs of the tobacco workers 
of Tampa and Key West who gave Marti, the delegate of the Cuban 
Revolutionary Party, 10 percent of their measly salaries to buy 
weapons for the Mambi Army! 
  Such efforts in the military aspect have helped sustain the 
work that we began seven years ago and which was the main focus 
of our previous congress. Many of the results the FAR have to 
show, particularly in production and services, are owed in great 
measure to the improvements made in the enterprise system begun 
back then, which also included budgeted units. I remember all 
the time we devoted to this issue during the fifth congress, the 
enthusiasm which with the delegates welcomed the idea, and all 
the progress made since 1987, unhurriedly, consolidating every 
inch of the way. 
  The contributions of the civilian workers of the FAR and its 
union organizations have been decisive to everything that has 
been attained on this economic front. We are aware that there 
are still problems that need to be solved. Nevertheless, we are 
convinced that civilians and military together, we will solve 
them one step at a time -- including the farming enterprises, 
where it is more difficult and complex to consolidate the 
structures, stabilize the work force, and become profitable. 
  The reduction of the expenses of the active FAR and the 
increase in profitability of our enterprises are the main 
pillars of our goal to make the FAR financially self-sufficient. 
This is the road we are following and we are exactly half-way 
there: This year, our budget was reduced by 50 percent. This was 
a concrete contributionm to correct the nation's financial 
imbalance, one of Cuba's main goals, as expressed in the recent 
resolutions of the National Assembly of the People's Government. 
This is also a reflection of the will of the peoples' vanguard 
as expressed in the Parliaments in the Workplace assemblies that 
gathered more than 3 million workers so as to hear their 
opinions and have them discuss the most crucial of the nation's 
problems, mobilize their enormous reserves of patriotism, and 
strengthen their revolutionary awareness. 
  We could talk about many other issues but this is not 
necessary, since they have been discussed extensively. Today, 
you have issued the call to the Sixth Congress of the Union of 
Civilian Workers of the FAR. The agenda contained in the summons 
is a broad one, and covers the main issues. Therefore, extensive 
study prior to the discussions and discussions at the base and 
middle levels will help not only to clarify the essence of these 
problems but also to mobilize everyone's will to promote 
solutions, as well as to increase political awareness. You can 
count on the utmost support of our commands, the political 
bodies and organizations of the Communist Party of Cuba, and the 
Union of Young Communists in the FAR. 
  The Sixth Congress is our congress, our civilian workers' 
most important event. The congress will be held in 1995, 100 
years after that congress at which the fatherland was reborn 
with a new call to arms for freedom, 100 years after the death 
in combat of Jose Marti and the epic war of independence headed 
by Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomez. 
  Fidel taught us how to commemorate national centennials. One 
hundred years after Marti's birth, he organized us and headed 
the assault on the Moncada Barracks. Let us pay a worthy homage 
to Marti's centennial, and to those heroic, sublime, and sacred 
moments of the fatherland's through an exemplary congress of the 
civilian workers of the glorious FAR. 
  I urge you to use all your intelligence and to work 
energetically and boldly during the next 12 months in order to 
attain that goal. We will meet at the Sixth Congress, but also 
before. Thank you very much. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Santiago de Cuba correspondent Carlos Zanabria </F>
and "Doing Radio" program host Orlando Contreras -- live] 
  [Text] [Zanabria] It has rained intensely in Santiago de 
Cuba. 
  [Contreras] This weekend? 
  [Zanabria] In the last 94 hours ...[corrects] in the last 72 
hours the amount of rainfall in Santiago de Cuba Province has 
been tremendous. 
  [Contreras] Approximately how many millimeters? 
  [Zanabria] Tercer Frente is the municipality where the most 
rainfall, over 300 mm, has been recorded in the last few hours. 
  [Contreras] Excuse me, how much did you say? 
  [Zanabria] Over 300 mm of rainfall in less than 24 hours. 
  [Contreras] Over 300 mm of rainfall. This is the rainfall 
recorded in many provinces during one entire year. 
  [Zanabria] For this municipality it is the average amount of 
rainfall for one year. 
  [Contreras] As I said, that would be the amount of rainfall 
expected in one year, and it fell within a 24-hour period. 
  [Zanabria] Exactly, and the same thing happened in Songo-La 
Maya where rainfall has been intense. In Santiago de Cuba 116 mm 
of rainfall fell in the last few hours. 
  [Contreras] I imagine that the floodgates of most dams are 
open. 
  [Zanabria] Yes. There are over 3,000 houses damaged, with 
over 1,000 of these in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, 80 of 
which were totally destroyed. In the municipality of Guama, 
unfortunately, there has been a fatality: Juan Gonzalez Jinarte, 
who was drunk and drowned while trying to cross a local river 
with his mules. 
  [Contreras] This was the only fatality? 
  [Zanabria] No, this was the second fatality. The first 
fatality occurred in Segundo Frente Municipality. 
  [Contreras] Given the magnitude of the rainfall, there have 
been very few vicitms. 
  [Zanabria] There were also fires this weekend in the 
Hermanos 
Diaz refinery and the Retome medical equipment factory. There 
have been many landslides, and floods in low-lying areas. 
  I am preparing a complete report for Doing Radio listeners, 
and then I will go out with the mobile unit and visit some of 
the places affected, for instance, the Rente Electric Plant 
which is off-line from the national electrical system. This is 
of great importance. Last night [22 May] there were long power 
outages in Santiago de Cuba, and in the midst of this rain, so 
you can imagine the situation here. 
  [Contreras] We await further information. I believe the news 
that you have given us up to now is outright poignant. There is 
another fatality in Santiago, and we can imagine that last night 
must have been very tense, considering everything that is 
happening. 
  [Zanabria] Last night, I spoke with the pilot of the 
(Aero-Caribbean) flight that arrived in Santiago de Cuba. I went 
to pick up Diosdado Maso and accompany Carmen Oria to the 
airport, as she was returning to Havana. The pilot informed me 
that he does not know how he managed to land at the Holguin 
airport, where the plane made a stopover, because the rainfall 
made it almost impossible to see the runway lights. 
  That is the situation here; and as I said earlier, I am 
about 
to visit some of the most hard-hit areas to obtain information 
for my next report. We will remain in contact the rest of the 
day. 
  [Contreras] Thank you very much Zanabria, and we await 
further information.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the 23 May edition of TRABAJADORES; title </F>
not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast -- 
read by Pedro Otero] 
  [Text] The revolutionary government has announced the 
implementation of nine important measures concerning the 
increase of prices and fees affecting the population. These 
measures, which will begin to be implemented 1 June and continue 
throughout the year, concur with one of the recent decisions 
reached by the National Assembly, and they mark the beginning of 
a phase during which interrelated measures that are part of a 
larger process will be implemented. These measures should 
result in the improvement of our internal finances and thereby 
lay the foundations for other actions that will benefit the 
country's economic stabilization and reorganization. 
  Although it has been said and repeated many times, it is 
necessary to reiterate this once again: There is no alternative 
to these measures and their implementation cannot be delayed any 
longer. During the first quarter of the year, the excess of 
currency increased by 591 million pesos. By the end of May, our 
monetary liquidity will be approximately 12 billion pesos. Any 
delay in facing this problem will only be against the vital 
interests of the nation and the working people. 
  It is true that these increases represent new sacrifices 
that 
will affect all of us to some degree. This cannot be denied. 
We have, however, faced sacrifices and hardships before, and 
none would be worse than the ones we would have to face should 
the current situation related to internal finances continue to 
deteriorate. We should reflect on this seriously because it is 
not a matter of applauding the measures. Nevertheless, we 
should be able to understand them and realize that the country 
has no other choice. 
  Higher prices and fees, particularly on cigarettes and 
alcoholic beverages -- price increases that were widely debated 
in the parliaments in the workplace -- are measures that can 
give us the best results in the near future in terms of 
generating revenues. According to forecasts from relevant state 
organizations, their implementation should contribute by the 
second half of the year to stop the increase of money in 
circulation, which should begin to recede before the end of the 
year. This would be an initial success and an encouraging step 
on the path we must take. 
  A key factor that should be explained to all workers in the 
country is that it is impossible under the current circumstances 
to think that these increases in prices and fees can be 
accompanied by a parallel and compensatory increase in salaries. 
We would be deceiving ourselves if we tried to make a general 
wage adjustment under current conditions. We must give real 
value to current salaries instead of issuing more paper money, 
which would only contribute to foster an endless vicious circle. 
This can only be achieved by increasing productivity, expanding 
the supply of goods and services, and gradually recovering the 
purchasing power of the Cuban peso. 
  The first step should be reducing to acceptable limits the 
internal financial imbalance. This, of course, does not 
invalidate the specific measures now being implemented in 
various parts of the country to encourage workers engaged in 
vital economic activities, to identify those who contribute the 
most, and to increase their real income through various means. 
  We must emphasize that, along with the strict measures, our 
government has taken steps to protect the most vulnerable and 
lowest income sectors. Even cigarettes, non-staple products 
that are hazardous to people's health, have been protected as 
much as possible for consumers who received fixed or controlled 
quotas through the application of different and lower prices 
than the ones that will prevail in the free market. 
  Another proposal that received broad support in the 
parliaments in the workplace was the move to eliminate subsidies 
in staple products obtained by ration cards and instead 
subsidize the individuals and families that are the most needy. 
In practice, the implementation of this proposal is turning out 
to be a long and complex process. This means the state will 
continue paying 365 million pesos a year to subsidize essential 
goods whose price has not been adjusted. Products whose prices 
will be increased do not represent an amount that cannot be paid 
by the lower income groups. 
  Another concrete example concerns electricity fees. Fees 
paid by those families that consume less than 100 kilowatts, 
approximately 53 percent of all families, will not be raised. 
The increase in electricity fees will be applied to the other 
47 percent of the families, those with greater incomes because 
they use 76 percent of the electricity supply assigned to the 
residential sector. This measure's essential goal is to 
encourage savings by spending less on fuel. In turn, it has 
been noted that the new fees will not replace or override the 
consumption plan or lead to the suspension of services for those 
who time and again exceed this plan. 
  The increase in train [word indistinct] fees, which prompted 
appropriate criticism, was wisely corrected while a 30 percent 
bonus was established for workers and students who regularly use 
this service. Some measures, such as the one aimed at 
eliminating the $100 million peso annual subsidy to the workers' 
soup kitchens, are economically significant. Meanwhile, other 
measures, such as the fixed fees for water and sewage service, 
and the increase in postal and telegraph services, although they 
are far from making the institutions that supply these services 
financially independent, will help the economy and will have a 
[word indistinct] and educational effect. 
  It is important to point out that these increases in prices 
and fees will contribute to one of today's most important goals 
-- namely, the reduction of the fiscal deficit. Consequently, 
the additional money collected will not, as a rule, remain for 
the most part within the companies or institutions. Rather, it 
will be included as part of the state's general budget as a 
circulation tax. This will also create a more favorable 
situation to progress toward the elimination of subsidies for 
losses and to gradually do away with this phenomenon. 
  It can be added that, despite the additional charge this 
represents for the family's economy and the harshness of the 
crisis we are experiencing, Cuban workers with modest salaries, 
thanks to the social policy of the revolution, spends less 
proportionately in housing, electricity, transportation, and 
basic staples than other Latin American workers. 
  Food supplies and other basic services supplied by the state 
will represent at most, after this reform, 43 percent of the 
minimum salary, while in Panama, the hemisphere's nation where 
this proportion is the lowest, it rises to 56 percent. 
[sentence as heard] In Cuba, more than 80 percent of the 
families own their house and only 10-15 percent of salary is 
paid as amortization. In the Latin American nation where this 
indicator is lowest -- Honduras -- rent is not under $105 a 
month for a modest two-room apartment. In the majority of the 
nations, as a rule, housing will cost as much as 50-60 percent 
of salaries. We must preserve and defend these gains and these 
realities over and above any circumstantial impediment. 
  Decree Law 149 on illegal enrichment and now these 
government 
decisions confirm the willingness to progress in a serene and 
decided manner toward the fulfillment of the policies outlined 
by the National Assembly of the People's Government, as well as 
the commitment to the full resolution of the problems we are 
facing. 
  We are looking at an extremely significant measure imposed 
on 
the people with regard to prices and fees, and this measure must 
be followed. When the time comes, other revisions must take 
place in the categories of prices and fees that even apply to 
the state itself. This is to stimulate greater efficiency and 
to [word indistinct] subsequent government decisions with regard 
to the [word indistinct] tax policy and other possible 
alternatives included in the arsenal of measures that this 
assembly approved. 
  In a flexible, intelligent manner, with the timely 
information and due explanation to the people, this decisive 
process will be implemented. We will not go half way. Our 
workers and the labor unions currently involved in holding 
meetings to achieve efficiency will undoubtedly unite around 
this effort to achieve greater production at a lower cost and 
with the best use of the scarce resources we have. This can be 
achieved through debate that [word indistinct] encourages 
comprehension and the firm support these decisions demand, the 
top goal of which is to contribute to defend our nation's 
independence and the revolutionary fatherland of the poor, by 
the poor, and for the poor. It is once again time to act as 
masters of our own destiny.
