<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic </F>
Department, by Kamal Tarabayh in Paris on 29 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Quray'] The most important positive point is that 
this agreement has been signed and laid the foundations for 
satisfactory and convincing policies for the process of an 
economic construction during the transition stage in the 
occupied Palestinian territories... 
  [Tarabayh, interrupting] Concerning the details... 
  [Quray'] Concerning the details, there is now a Palestinian 
monetary institution that enjoys almost 90 percent of a central 
bank's powers. With the exception of issuing banknotes, this 
institution enjoys all of a central bank's jurisdictions and 
powers. There is now a right to trade with the Arab world, with 
the Islamic world, and with the foreign world. Consequently, 
for the first time, borders are now open for Palestinian 
agricultural products to enter the Israeli market. In the past, 
the Palestinian market was open to the Israeli agricultural 
products, but Palestinian products were not allowed to enter the 
Israeli market. Now, the market is open. Industry has also 
become the right of the Palestinian authority which decides, 
defines, and issues licenses. It even defines the standards of 
the Palestinian industry. There are important issues 
which....[sentence incomplete as heard] 
  [Tarabayh] Concerning the Palestinian workers' movement 
between the autonomous region and Israel, are there any specific 
measures which contribute to the freedom of their movement? 
  [Quray'] The agreed upon thing is that there will be freedom 
of movement for both sides' workers, and any of the two sides 
has the right to determine the number of these workers. 
  [Tarabayh] Do you consider this economic agreement a basic 
pillar for the completion of the autonomy agreement and the 
establishment of a national authority? 
  [Quray'] I believe we have made the basic and major step 
toward the establishment of the independent Palestinian state. 
  [Tarabayh] Still, there are pending issues over which there 
are differences. In short, what are the most important of these 
issues? 
  [Quray'] There are points. This is a big, complicated, and 
long issue. There is an occupation which will be replaced by a 
new national authority. Therefore, there are many pending 
issues. 
  [Tarabayh] What about customs and fees? 
  [Quray'] Many issues and problems have been solved, and 
policies have been drawn. These policies might be reconsidered 
and developed at a later time in light of experience and 
implementation on the ground. 
  [Tarabayh] What about currency? 
  [Quray'] Currency is not the main point, but one of the 
points. When the authority is established on the ground, our 
people, everywhere, will have an authority to take care of them 
and of their affairs, and to adopt their issues.

  [Text] Israel has permitted the Palestinian autonomy to 
establish an institution parallel to a securities exchange. 
This transpires from the Israeli-PLO economic agreement. Our 
economic affairs correspondent Menahem Friedman reports that the 
Gaza and Jericho municipalities will be able to issue bonds to 
raise capital inside the autonomy, while economic bodies will be 
able to issue stocks.

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 29 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir 
'Arafat should enter the West Bank town of Jericho in the first 
week of June, a senior Israeli negotiator said Friday [29 April]. 
  "There is nothing to stop Yasir 'Arafat going to Jericho as 
soon as the autonomy agreement is signed on Wednesday," said the 
official who refused to be named. 
  "But he will no doubt wait until the first week of June when 
the Israeli army has completed its withdrawal and redeployment," 
the negotiator told journalists aboard a return flight to Tel 
Aviv from Cairo where an agreement to launch autonomy was 
reached on Thursday. 
  The official also confirmed that besides freeing 5,000 
Palestinian prisoners after the agreement is signed, Israel and 
the PLO had decided that Palestinians opposed to the peace 
process could also be released from jail. 
  But he explained: "We are ready to envisage such releases 
only if the prisoners make a written commitment (renouncing 
violence) and if their hands are not stained with (Israeli) 
blood." 
  Negotiations would continue on the fate of the 9,000 
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, he said.

  [Text] Cairo, May 1 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will personally assess the 
cases of certain Palestinian prisoners whom the PLO wants 
released, a Palestinian negotiator said Sunday [1 May]. 
  "The cases of certain prisoners will be discussed at the 
highest level," said Jibril Rajjub. 
  But he would not say whether they belonged to the Islamic 
Resistance Movement Hamas. 
  Meanwhile, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th, arriving in 
Cairo from Tunis, said the draft accord for Palestinian 
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho had 
been approved by 'Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction. 
  Israel has already agreed to release 5,000 of the 10,000 
Palestinians held in Israeli jails within three weeks of a 
self-rule deal being signed. 
  But it has refused to release any prisoners who took part in 
bloody attacks on Israelis, despite the PLO's insistence that 
all prisoners should be freed. 
  Sha'th returned to Cairo Sunday to start a new, and possibly 
last, round of talks with Israeli negotiators. 
  Rajjub said the question of prisoners was the chief 
remaining 
hurdle. 
  Israel had offered to release 3,400 more prisoners in return 
for an amnesty for Palestinian collaborators, PLO sources said 
last week. 
  Talks were due to resume here Sunday to iron out the last 
differences before a signing ceremony scheduled for Wednesday in 
the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  Rabin and 'Arafat are expected here Tuesday to sort out any 
last-minute problems before signing the autonomy accord for the 
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Sha'th said he had attended meetings of the Fatah and PLO 
executive committees to debate the final Palestinian decision. 
  He said Fatah had agreed to the accord, and the PLO's 
executive committee was to meet again before making a decision.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA)--The final round of 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations began here today to put the 
final touches on the general agreement on th e implementation of 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian delegation is led by Major General 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, because Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President 
'Arafat's political adviser, is currently in Tunis. The Israeli 
delegation is led by Amnon Shahaq, the assistant chief of staff, 
who arrived in Cairo earlier today. 
  Palestinian delegation member Khalid al-Qidrah stated that 
the two delegations will complete drafting the general 
agreement. He said: We are about to finish. I think that we 
will finish everything in time. 
  Sources close to the negotiations said that over the past 
two 
days the Palestinian and Israeli delegations have narrowed the 
differences on all points a great deal. The sources said that 
the two delegations will draft some paragraphs in the agreement 
but they are still under discussion. 
  They said that with regard to the entry of the Palestinian 
police into Gaza and Jericho, the Israeli delegation thinks that 
an initial group of 25 policemen can enter on the day of the 
signing. They added that 1,000 to 1,500 policemen will enter 
the territories within one week of the signing. The remainder 
will follow. The sources explained that the number of 
Palestinian policemen agreed upon is 9,000. 
  The sources said that the Palestinian delegation thinks 
there 
is no sense in the entry of an initial small group, and that the 
whole Palestinian police force should enter the autonomous areas 
during the first week after the signing and after the Israeli 
withdrawal, which will begin the day after Palestinian president 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sign the 
Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement. 
  The source said that on Tuesday 'Arafat and Rabin will 
discuss two points, namely the size of Jericho's area and the 
presence of a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge. 
  One opinion is that the area of Jericho should be 57 square 
kilometers, the sources said, adding that Israel will also agree 
to the presence of an Israeli policeman at the crossing point 
when the Palestinians enter and an inconspicuous Israeli 
observer to intervene whenever there is suspicion regarding 
those who cross into the autonomous areas.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President 
Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, arrived in Cairo this evening 
from Tunis via Rome. Sha'th said in an arrival statement that 
in Tunis he attended meetings held by the Fatah Central 
Committee and the PLO Executive Committee to adopt a decision 
regarding the agreement to be signed on Wednesday in Cairo on 
Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
  He said that the Fatah Central Committee had approved this 
agreement, and the PLO Executive Committee will continue 
discussing it at a meeting to be held today. He said that the 
two Palestinian bodies were briefed on what was agreed upon and 
the outstanding issues on which agreement will be sought. We 
are armed with a strong stand by the PLO and the Fatah Movement, 
he said. 
  Regarding the most important topics to be discussed at the 
current Palestinian-Israeli round of negotiations, Sha'th said: 
We will strive to complete the drafting of the general 
agreement and reach agreement on some security issues and the 
geographical jurisdiction issue. He added: We have opened the 
way to a new dawn for our Palestinian people after their long 
suffering under harsh, oppressive, and illegitimate occupation.

update us on the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Good 
evening, Sha'ul. 
  [Menashe] Good evening to you. A short while ago, Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th arrived here at the site of the negotiations from Tunis 
where he held meetings and consultations. He told journalists: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] I outlined to Fatah's Central 
Committee and the PLO's Executive Committee, as did my brother 
Abu- al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] how things stand vis-a-vis the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and the economic agreement. A deep and 
exhaustive study of every aspect of these agreements was 
undertaken. We obtained Fatah's Central Committee's 
ratification of what has been agreed upon, and we received 
instructions for the next few days leading up to the signing on 
Wednesday [4 May]. [end recording] 
  [Menashe] Nabil Sha'th expects the Legal and Security 
Committees will now proceed to draft the agreement without any 
hitches.

<F P=106> ["Unofficial Text of the Draft Declaration of Principles </F>
Proposed by the United States to the States Participating in the 
Multilateral Negotiations" -- AL-HAYAH headline] 
  [Text] Taking into consideration the urgent need for a 
just, lasting, and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle 
East based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338; 
recognizing the historic achievements made since the 1991 Madrid 
conference on peace in the Middle East, particularly the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and the joint 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda; recognizing that the working 
committees stemming from the multilateral negotiations 
complement the bilateral negotiations and help improve the 
atmosphere with a view to putting an end to the Arab-Israeli 
conflict by creating opportunities for regional cooperation in 
tackling practical and important regional issues; agreeing that 
all parties in the region should work jointly for the common 
objective of establishing full and permanent relations of peace, 
reconciliation, frankness, mutual trust, security, stability, 
and economic and social cooperation and progress throughout the 
entire region; having commenced the multilateral negotiations 
with the following aims: 
  -- Providing a concept for the Middle East that would serve 
as a guide to the next steps in the process and give the peoples 
of the region confidence and hope for material improvements in 
their lives as a result of the establishment of a just, lasting, 
and comprehensive peace; 
  -- Consolidating arms control and regional security 
arrangements aimed at promoting mutual security for all with the 
least possible level of armament and armed forces; 
  -- Alleviating the tragedies of those who have become 
refugees as a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict with emphasis 
on tangible projects to improve the living conditions of all the 
Palestinian refugees. 
  In anticipation of comprehensive peace, the multilaterals 
[negotiations] will seek to enhance regional cooperation and 
economic development with Israeli and Arab participation through 
tangible projects in which the parties of the region would 
participate; 
  -- Enhancing water supplies for the people of the region by 
boosting cooperation among the parties in activities that would 
lead to a better use of the existing resources and better supply; 
  -- Improving the environment in the region through 
cooperation in the fields of environmental management, sea 
pollution, water quality, drainage, and handling of barren land 
and creeping desert. 
  Recognizing that complete fulfillment of the objectives 
stated in this declaration would be facilitated by the 
participation of all the regional parties in the multilateral 
negotiations, especially Syria and Lebanon; and calling on all 
these parties to support the principles included in this 
declaration and to join the multilateral negotiations at an 
early date, 
  The Steering Committee stemming from the multilateral 
negotiations has adopted the following: 
  Basic principles governing relations between the regional 
parties in the Middle East: 
  The regional parties in the Middle East, in seeking a just, 
lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and in 
aspiring to a prosperous future for the region's peoples 
involved, will establish relations according to the following 
basic principles: 
  -- Respect for and recognition of all provisions of Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  -- Respect for the UN Charter. 
  -- Respect for and recognition of sovereignty, territorial 
integrity, and political independence. 
  -- Peaceful settlement of disputes. 
  -- Honest fulfillment of commitments according to 
international law. 
  -- Freedom of access to the wealth of knowledge and 
information across national borders. 
  -- Encouragement of individual and collective freedoms, 
individual initiative, and creativity of the people of the 
region, with a pledge of democracy and plurality. 
  -- Market economy should be acknowledged as a main factor 
in decisions relating to the movement of goods, services, and 
ideas. 
  General guidelines for the multilateral negotiation parties 
in the peace process: 
  The Steering Committee has adopted the following as general 
guidelines for the multilateral negotiations and process: 
  -- As part of the peace process which began in Madrid in 
1991, the multilateral negotiations should be completed and 
should create a suitable atmosphere for progress in the 
bilateral negotiations. The task groups should proceed at their 
own pace. 
  -- The multilateral negotiations should concentrate on 
planning and implementing tangible projects. 
  -- Every task group should consider and implement clear 
and binding projects that would meet the needs of the region's 
peoples. 
  -- The multilateral process should seek to organize and 
coordinate the financing of agreed regional projects. 
  -- Individual activities should be programmed and 
coordinated to increase their effectiveness and minimize their 
ineffectiveness. 
  -- The multilateral task groups should examine ways to 
ensure the participation and expansion of the role of the 
private sector in regional cooperation. 
  -- Official and unofficial communications between the 
regional participants should be enhanced through a 
communications network. 
  -- The multilateral process should begin to develop a 
vision of the region after the establishment of peace on the 
bilateral tracks, including a study of regional establishments 
which the region might need, and development of such 
establishments. 
  Declaration of intentions relating to the aims of the 
multilateral negotiations: 
  In the course of the promotion of a reconciliation and a 
just 
peace and lasting comprehensive security, the Steering Committee 
sets, among other things, the following aims for the task groups 
emanating from the multilateral negotiations: 
  -- Control of armament and regional security: Prevention of 
disputes resulting from misunderstanding or miscalculation by 
adopting confidence and security building measures and by 
cutting military expenditure in the region, reducing traditional 
arms arsenals, preventing the traditional arms race, moving 
toward power structures that do not go beyond legitimate defense 
needs, and creating a region free from all weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  -- The environment: Implementation of regional projects for 
treatment of sea pollution, water quality, drainage, management 
of barren land and creeping desert, and creation of regional 
foundations for environmental issues. 
  -- The refugees: Development of a data center for 
information on the number of the refugees, assessment of the 
costs of the various required solutions, and efforts to improve 
their economic and social conditions without fanaticism and 
without prejudging the political negotiations. 
  -- Regional economic development: Elimination of the 
obstacles impeding free economic dealing (movement of goods, 
capital, and work force) across the borders, development of 
economic resources and projects on a regional basis, and 
creation of free trade zones and foundations for regional 
economic cooperation. 
  -- Water: Implementation of programs to improve the supply 
of adequate quantities of good water to the peoples of the 
region, including an information bank for water resources, 
programs for cooperation to preserve water and improve its 
reservoirs, as well as regional water management plans.

  [Text] Druze leaders on the Golan Heights and in the 
Galilee have urged the Israeli Government, if its transfers 
Druze villages to Syria as part of a settlement, not to 
differentiate between the villages. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht notes that on the map prepared 
by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] within the framework of the 
plan called Majdal Shams First, three Druze villages -- Majdal 
Shams, Mas'adah, and Buq'ata -- will be transferred to the 
Syrians, while 'Ayn Qunyah, which is situated on lower terrain, 
will remain with Israel. 
  The Druze are demanding that the villages not be divided up 
and that all the lands that belong to them be transferred to 
Syria. Several Druze families on the Golan Heights have bought 
land in various locations in the Galilee in order to move there 
if the Golan is returned to Syria. Other Druze families are 
looking into that possibility and also the prospect of buying 
land on the Karmel. Our correspondent notes that Druze leaders 
are helping the Golan Druze. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0705 GMT on 30 April in 
a similar, but longer, report on the proposal adds: "Mt. Hermon 
and the road leading up to it, will of course remain under 
Israeli control. Israel is offering al-Asad two options, the 
first of course, preferable to us: Take the Druze villages 
first, we tell him, without the move being preceded by a 
pronouncement that we are conceding our sovereignty over the 
Golan Heights. The Israeli carrot to that option is a readiness 
to implement it immediately within three months. Al-Asad is a 
tough customer, therefore it is more reasonable that he will 
prefer the second option: The word first will be fortified by a 
Knesset resolution which recognizes Syrian sovereignty over the 
entire Golan Heights. What will sweeten Rabin's bitter pill is 
the fact that not a single Israeli settlement will be evacuated, 
just as in Gaza and Jericho First."]

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 30 (AFP)--A decline in imports by 
key Arab oil producers and economic reforms by non-oil states 
slashed the Arab balance of payments deficit by nearly 65 
percent in 1992, an official report said on Saturday [30 April]. 
  The deficit, which was non-existent during the oil boom, 
stood at seven billion dollars in 1992 compared with 20 billion 
dollars in 1991, said the report released by the Abu Dhabi-based 
Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). 
  The report divided the 22-member Arab League into two 
groups: 
the first comprising the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) plus key oil producers Iraq, Libya and Algeria, and the 
second the 13 members, which have little oil. 
  It showed exports of goods and services by the first group 
increased slightly to 114 billion dollars from 113 billion 
dollars while exports by the second group jumped to 34 billion 
dollars from 29 billion dollars. 
  "What helped this positive development in exports by the 
second group is the policy of freeing prices of goods and 
exchange rates, easing government restrictions on foreign trade 
and supporting export activities by the private sector as part 
of economic reforms," the report said. 
  Imports by the second group rose to 47 billion dollars from 
41 billion dollars while the first group slashed imports to 108 
billion dollars from 121 billion dollars in the same period, it 
said. 
  Experts said the combined Arab balance of payment deficit 
was 
caused by a sharp decline in crude prices over the past decade 
as oil exports account for more than 70 percent of the total 
Arab exports. 
  In 1980, when oil prices shot above 30 dollars, exports by 
the first group peaked at 235 billion dollars. With imports 
standing at 114 billion dollars, the balance of payments 
registered a record surplus of 121 billion dollars before it 
started to deteriorate in the following years. 
  Such exports plummeted to 108 billion dollars in 1985 when 
oil prices went below 20 dollars then recovered slightly to 113 
billion dollars in 1991. 
  The report said the improvement in exports of goods and 
services by the second group pushed their ratio to the Gross 
Domestic Product to 27 percent in 1992 from between 18 and 24 
percent in the first half of 1980s. 
  A breakdown showed members of the first group, except Kuwait 
and Iraq, had a surplus in their balance of payments in 1992 
while all those in the second group were still suffering from a 
deficit. 
  The biggest surplus was recorded in the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE), standing at 4.47 billion dollars. It stood at 1.12 
billion dollars in Algeria and between one billion and two 
billion dollars in Oman and Qatar. 
  In Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producer and exporter, 
the surplus was only 693 million dollars due to a surge in 
imports, the report said. 
  Kuwait, which had enjoyed a persistent surplus before the 
1990 Iraqi invasion, suffered from a small deficit of 30 million 
dollars because of a sharp rise in imports and a decline in oil 
exports. 
  Iraq, still under a UN embargo, had a deficit of 728 million 
dollars, with exports standing at 413 million dollars and 
imports at 1.141 billion dollars. The report did not give 
details of the Iraqi trade. 
  The report, which covered economic developments in the Arab 
world for 1992, showed public and private investment in the 
region totalled 112 billion dollars during that year compared 
with 98 billion dollars in 1991. 
  Around 83.6 billion dollars were invested in the first group 
and Saudi Arabia received the lion share, with investment of 
29.5 billion dollars. The report showed investment in Iraq 
stood at 14.2 billion dollars while no investment was registered 
in war-torn Somalia. 
  It estimated the combined Arab Gross National Product at 
478.9 billion dollars, of which the first group accounted for 
347.7 billion dollars.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA)--The Fatah Central Committee, 
the PLO mainstream faction, has approved the draft 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement scheduled to be signed by 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 4 May. 
  The approval came during a four-hour meeting which the Fatah

Sha'th last night briefed the committee on the details of the 
agreement. 
  The agreement was approved with a majority of votes of the 
18-member committee. Hani al-Hasan, Khalid al-Hasan, and 'Abbas 
Zaki were absent from the meeting. 
  For over a week the committee discussed the details of the 
draft, which consists of over 90 pages containing the details of 
the agreement which the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have 
reached after months of talks in Cairo.

  [Text] Tunis, 1 May (MENA) -- The Fatah Central Committee 
tonight ended its consultations on the formation of the National 
Authority Council that will run self-rule affairs in the Gaza 
strip and Jericho. 
  Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahman, Fatah Central Committee member and 
Palestinian ambassador to Jordan, said the National Authority 
Council will comprise 25 members, half of them from the occupied 
Palestinian lands and the other half from Palestinians of the 
diaspora, in addition to Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Among key members from diaspora Palestinians are Economic 
Department Chief Ahmad Quray', also known as Abu-'Ala'; Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th; and Intisar al-Wazir, also known as Umm-Jihad. 
Key representatives from residents of the occupied Palestinian 
territories are Faysal al-Husayni from the West Bank and 
Zakariya al-Agha from Gaza. The council will also include Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, Samir Ghawshah, Yasir 'Amr, and Muhammad Zuhdi 
al-Nashashibi. 
  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, will 
not 
be a council member because the Political Department will remain 
outside Gaza and Jericho, most probably in Tunis. 
  Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin, expressed the desire 
not to enter Gaza and Jericho, preferring to remain abroad to 
carry out other political tasks. He also expressed the desire 
not to become a council member.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO adviser Bassam Abu-Sharif by </F>
Lorenzo Cremonesi in Gorizia; date not given: "The PLO Must 
Change Now or It Will Be the End"] 
  [Text] "My dream is to be able to enter Gaza and Jericho 
with 'Arafat. We are now very close. The first to arrive will 
be our policemen, then we, the PLO political leaders. But I 
have always said: The beginning of true Palestinian autonomy 
will also mark the end of the PLO as we have known it until now. 
We have to change jobs, become good, honest administrators, 
build up our self-governing institutions. The motto will be: 
Change or die. Very difficult times lie ahead of us. None of 
us really knows what will be the outcome of the meeting of the 
leaders returning from the diaspora, on the one hand, with the 
residents of the occupied territories, on the other." 
  Bassam Abu-Sharif is venting his feelings. And doing so with 
a torrent of words, faxes, communications, and telephone calls, 
impetuously and continuously. We met him a few days ago at 
Gorizia, during a congress on peace in the Middle East organized 
by students from the International Sciences Faculty. His phone 
rang continuously. 
  Because Abu-Sharif has just completed a long quarantine. 
Aged 47, and 30 years spent in the Palestinian resistance, last 
autumn he was seen as a political has-been, finished, fallen 
into disgrace for ever. He, every journalist's and diplomat's 
reference point during 'Arafat's long periods of silence, the 
only person able to say what was going on in the PLO's corridors 
of power, the former Fedayeen with his face disfigured by a 
letter bomb sent to him by the Israelis on 25 July 1972 in 
Beirut, had even had his telephone lines cut. He fends off 
questions with a dismissive smile. 
  "You know how things are in the PLO. We never pay the phone 
bills. Mine in four years was more than 120,000 dollars. 
Following this they cut my telephone to save money." Then, 
however, the explanation became more political. "There is an 
old discussion within the PLO. For years many of them have been 
calling for greater democracy. But one knows how it is with 
'Arafat. He brings us close to him and then distances us 
according to circumstances and what is convenient at the time. 
It happened to Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] (who signed the 
self-government agreement in September), to Faruq Qaddumi (seen 
as the PLO's foreign minister), and it is not surprising that it 
should also happen to me. Can you image that, during last 
spring and summer, all of us remained in the dark with regard to 
the Oslo agreements until the last minute. Only Abu- 'Ala' 
[Ahmad Quray'] (the PLO's financial manager) was aware of 
'Arafat's plans, and knew in depth how the secret negotiations 
were going with Rabin's people. But today the situation has 
changed. They have given me back my telephone in Tunis and I 
have begun work again after two months' absence for an operation 
to my ear in a Paris hospital." 
  And to demonstrate his full reinsertion into the Palestine 
nomenclature, Abu-Sharif did not hesitate to explain the latest 
developments in the negotiations with "Hamas," the group active 
in the occupied territories and which rejects compromise with 
Israel in the name of Islamic fundamentalism. 
  "One and a half month ago Hamas published a statement in 
which it said that it was ready to avoid collision with the 
Palestinian police force set up to manage the self-governing 
areas. From there on we are seeking to arrive at an internal 
agreement with them. The question remains open." 
  And what should one think about the latest signals 
indicating 
that Hamas could even be ready to participate in the plans for 
self-government? 
  "It is hard to say. It is not improbable. If they accept 
the authority of our police, then everything is possible. In 
fact, Hamas is much more pragmatic and articulate than is 
generally believed. I am also convinced that, once 
self-government has been achieved and in particular the projects 
for economic renewal in Gaza and Jericho have been started up, 
many followers of fundamentalism will then become PLO 
supporters."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jibril al-Rajub, 'Arafat's senior adviser, </F>
by political correspondent Udi Segal in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Rajub] Look, in my opinion they have not given 
up anything [not further specified]. An agreement was reached, 
we received something, and I am also absolutely sure that peace, 
coexistence, and security will be achieved for all the civilians 
living in the territories. 
  [Segal] What about the agreement between the PLO and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]? 
  [Al-Rajub] There never was, nor will there ever be such an 
agreement after we enter the territories. We will abide by 
everything we signed. 
  [Segal] Do you see any possibility for cooperation between 
Hamas and the PLO? 
  [Al-Rajub] It is not a question of cooperation, but rather 
of a national interest. I think it is in the national interest 
of the Palestinian people to convince most of the public to 
abide by the agreement. 
  [Segal] What about collaborators? 
  [Al-Rajub] Look, as you say in Hebrew, it is necessary to 
stamp out all traitors. I think that those who shed blood and 
those who crossed the red line will be tried. We are entitled 
to put these people on trial. It is inconceivable that a man 
who opened fire and killed people because he collaborated with 
the occupation forces will be pardoned. This will never happen. 
  [Segal] What about the others? 
  [Al-Rajub] Look, we will examine every case individually. 
  [Segal] What remains to be solved before the comprehensive 
agreement is signed on Wednesday? 
  [Al-Rajub] It has been determined that the agreement will be 
signed on Wednesday, which means that all the other problems 
will be overcome in the next three days.

  [Text] The following is the six-point agreement concluded 
yesterday by Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). 
It was undersigned by "Fatah Hawks" and "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
Battalions." According to the document, the parties agree: 
  1. To immediately halt all defamation campaigns between 
Fatah and Hamas, provided the right to freedom of expression and 
opinion is guaranteed to everyone. A fraternal dialogue between 
the two organizations will be held to decide measures that will 
serve our lofty masses everywhere. 
  2. To renounce differences and bloody conflicts and stop 
using violence to resolve these differences. The two sides 
emphasize the need to be committed to constructive dialogue 
among our people to put an end to the conspiracies being 
concocted to trap our people in chronic crises and differences. 
  3. As of the date of this statement, the wanted persons and 
gunmen of both sides are prohibited from interfering to resolve 
organizational or family problems. The Islamic and national 
reconciliation committees are asked to play their role in 
resolving any problem that may arise. If no solution is 
reached, the leaders of the political factions are to intervene 
to put an end to the problems. Fatah and Hamas will work out a 
suitable mechanism for implementing this resolution. 
  4. After a long study of our people's economic conditions, 
it has been decided to stage a one-day strike for every martyr 
in his own neighborhood only and to declare only one day of 
mourning in the remaining areas. The intifadah activists are 
hereby prohibited from throwing stones at cars moving for urgent 
reasons. The two parties appeal to all factions to reduce 
overall strikes as much as possible. In cases of emergencies, a 
strike shall be announced jointly and through a fraternal and 
constructive understanding. 
  5. Regarding educational matters, we urge our male and 
female students to remain in their classes during strikes. All 
students are urged to deal with any attempt to force them out of 
their classes. 
  6. After a careful study of the question of collaborators, 
Fatah and Hamas have decided to stop killing collaborators 
between 22 April 1994 and 22 May 1994. During this period, 
efforts will be made to tackle this phenomenon. We advise the 
collaborators to cut off their ties with the enemy's 
intelligence agencies for God's mercy is better for them than 
the enemy's hell. This month will provide a chance to 
reconsider and define positions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, Hamas representative in </F>
Lebanon, by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHIRA'] There were reports recently about the 
existence of an Islamic-Islamic dialogue in which you were 
involved. What is the dialogue about and has it had any results? 
  [Al-Liddawi] The Palestinian problem is going through its 
most critical phases at present. Years of suffering and 
sacrifice have been forgotten and ignored. All our Palestinian 
people's rights have also been bypassed and ignored and there is 
no more talk about the Palestinian people's dream of returning 
to the homeland and establishing their independent state on all 
the national soil. 
  Thus, in view of the gravity of the plot and the great 
sacrifices already made, we had to stand firm against the 
squandering of our rights and those squandering them in order to 
protect our people's right to their territories and homeland. 
The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] was eager to consult 
all partners in the battle with a common destiny in order to 
discuss how to frustrate this genocidal plot. The dialogue was 
not limited to a specific party but to all those who are loyal 
to this cause. We were prompted in this by the accelerated 
squandering of our rights and our belief that all must be 
involved in a coordinated and organized move to foil this plot. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] With which Arab Islamic forces is Hamas meeting? 
How do you justify the methods followed, specifically those in 
Egypt and Algeria? 
  [Al-Liddawi] As written in its charter, Hamas believes that 
Palestine is an Islamic awqaf land, that is, it belongs to all 
Muslims everywhere, regardless of their race, and to all Muslim 
generations throughout the ages. Hence the burden of liberating 
it falls on the shoulders of all Muslims. 
  On this premise, Hamas believes that it should have solid 
ties with all the Islamic and Arab parties whose objective is to 
liberate Palestine and restore the Palestinian people's 
legitimate and historic rights. Hamas believes that all the 
Arab and Islamic efforts must unite to liberate Palestine. 
Hamas needs the efforts of everyone who is faithful to the 
Palestinian people and their cause, even if we have differences 
with some of them over ideas and ideologies. 
  As for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria, the Hamas 
policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others; this is 
based on our desire to maintain the uniqueness of the our 
Palestinian cause. Hence, we do not interfere. But at the same 
time, we call on all the parties to refer their differences to 
the Koran and the true Islamic path. We also call on all of 
them to begin a dialogue in order to end all the illusions and 
deceptions that the enemies of this Islamic nation are trying to 
plant in our midst to create more divisions and differences. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] You stand accused of impeding the work of the 
Palestinian forces' alliance by rejecting the election of an 
alternative leadership to 'Arafat and because of your bad 
relations with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] which reached their nadir when you killed one 
of its military officials, "Yusuf Abu-Lafi," in the occupied 
territories? 
  [Al-Liddawi] Everyone knows that Hamas was the first to come 
up with the idea of bringing the 10 Palestinian groups and other 
forces that reject the settlement process together for the sake 
of joint Palestinian action. We are serious about heightening 
the Palestinian groups' action and developing their methods of 
political confrontation in order to abort 'Arafat's defeatist 
policy. We made several proposals when we started the move for 
a framework of a Palestinian forces' alliance. We presented 
serious ideas in several working papers but we met many selfish 
and subjective obstacles from some groups. The delay in 
reaching agreement on the alliance was probably caused by these 
groups' study of the plan and not Hamas. 
  Regarding the issue of electing a leadership that would act 
as an alternative to 'Arafat, we believe that we must first have 
more jihad work to abort the liquidationist plan while 
simultaneously embarking on a gradual rebuilding of the PLO 
institutions. We agreed on this with the other groups. I do 
not think that we disagree with those who say that the 
Palestinian people need a wise leadership that will save it from 
this gloomy fate, but at the same time we want to rebuild the 
PLO institutions gradually rather than leap into the unknown. 
  The reports that the reason Hamas has no desire to elect an 
alternative leadership to 'Arafat and is opposed to holding 
elections outside the occupied homeland for that purpose is 
because it fears that it will not get very much support outside 
the territories are not true. Hamas has no fear about this 
because its increasing influence inside Palestine is the same as 
its influence outside. Though it does not have an 
organizational framework abroad, Hamas is still capable of 
having an effective popular and organizational presence. This 
only requires a clear organizational decision to publicize all 
Hamas members and supporters abroad and overnight we would 
become the strongest Palestinian organization inside and outside 
the territories. But we reject partial elections. We are 
seeking comprehensive Palestinian elections for the Palestinian 
people, wherever they are. We do not want flashy and formal 
elections that do not bring the best for our people or which are 
held through popular conferences where the conferees are not 
allowed any freedom of opinion. 
  As for our differences with the DFLP, we were deeply pained 
by what happened and our pain increased when the DFLP opted to 
discuss some of the problems between the two sides in the media 
and in front of those who gloat over these differences. I do 
not want to rehash the problem's details, for we jointly put an 
end to it. But I hope that the brothers in the DFLP will 
embrace the principle of coordination with us and that none of 
us will resort to publicizing our differences in the media. The 
DFLP will find that Hamas is ready to deal with it on the basis 
of coordination and respect for each other, especially as we are 
both going through such difficult times. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] You are part of an alliance of Palestinian 
groups. However, the narrow and self-promoting tactics you 
followed when election lists were being prepared for the 
formation of Palestinian institutions inside the homeland led to 
wins by 'Arafat's supporters. Are you going to continue these 
tactics? And, how will this affect other Palestinian groups 
opposed to 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Liddawi] This is completely untrue. Hamas is fully 
committed to furthering its alliance in the elections in all 
syndicates and electoral constituencies. We have already won 
elections in many institutions in alliance with other 
Palestinian groups. Hamas has never followed any self-defeating 
self-serving tactics. Maybe others did, but not us. Hamas has 
long suffered from such practices and sees them as detrimental. 
There are many indications of this. In an effort to reinforce 
our alliance, we call on our brothers in other Palestinian 
groups to coordinate openly with us in all matters concerning 
elections. This will strengthen us and help us defeat 'Arafat, 
his supporters, and their capitulationist line. 
  We and other Palestinian groups have agreed to act as equals 
within the framework of our alliance. We are all politically 
equal. There is no difference between one group and another. No 
group is entitled to veto another. Everyone has the right to 
express their own views. Each of us has its own vote, and 
decisions are made on the basis of consensus, not majority. 
  As for the elections, Hamas is ready to merge its lineup 
with 
like-minded Palestinian groups in any location. Every group 
will get as many seats as justified by its representation and 
any prior agreement. But Hamas is the only active group in 
several areas, and it is only logical that we should run on our 
own in such cases. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Your killing of Abu-Lafi could trigger a 
Kabul-style conflict in the occupied territories. The elements 
of strife are there. What do you plan to do to avoid this 
scenario? 
  [Al-Liddawi] As I said in my last answer, we seek closer 
coordination everywhere. We want to cooperate seriously with 
other groups in order to serve the Palestinian cause. We want 
to harass the enemy with more painful operations. We want to 
contain any problem, however big, by referring it to the joint 
coordination committee. We should not pay attention to press 
reports and allegations, for these normally throw fuel on the 
fire. 
  With more understanding, coordination, and working together, 
we will avoid becoming a second Kabul. We have to remember that 
the enemy is doing everything it can to foment sedition and 
trigger infighting among us. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] There were attempts to initiate a dialogue 
between you and 'Arafat after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
How far have these attempts gone? 
  [Al-Liddawi] There will be no dialogue with 'Arafat until he 
withdraws from the settlement process and renounces the Oslo 
agreement. There have been no dialogues with 'Arafat following 
his recent involvement in the quagmire of the Oslo agreement. 
  But at the same time, we might meet with Fatah members 
inside 
the occupied homeland to solve local problems and avert any 
further aggravation of the existing bad situation between the 
two movements. Such meetings would also help prevent the 
struggle from dissolving into infighting. We must make every 
possible effort to insure that such infighting never occurs. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] You have been equated with the Zionist 
hardliners 
who reject the negotiations. Could you respond to this? 
  [Al-Liddawi] Where and how are we equal? We are endeavoring 
to regain our usurped rights in Palestine, all of Palestine, and 
we are using all legal and legitimate methods in our struggle 
against our enemy for the sake of recovering our legal rights. 
  As for the Zionist hardliners, they are unjustly trying to 
keep Palestine as their homeland. They are using all unlawful 
means to achieve their designs and are being assisted in this by 
the Zionist government. 
  Finally, we reject the existing negotiations, which are 
bound 
to forfeit all the Palestinian people's rights and waste all 
their sacrifices from the long years of suffering and 
persecution. God willing, we will continue our jihad and our 
work until the occupation is driven from our land.

<F P=106> [Report by Fayiz 'Abbas] </F>
  [Text] "In principle, I support a just and lasting peace 
that will guarantee the Palestinian people their rights." This 
statement was made over the weekend by Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the 
founder of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
  The shaykh was speaking to his attorney, 'Abd-al-Malik 
Dahamshah, in response to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' 
assertion that Yasin could be released if he were to express 
support for the peace process. Yasin said he rejects any 
conditions being set for his release; however, he supports a 
just peace process. 
  Tomorrow will mark five years since the disappearance of 
soldier Ilan Sa'adon. In reaction to statements made by the 
Sa'adon family, Shaykh Yasin asserted this week that he does not 
know the whereabouts of the soldier's body. The shaykh claimed 
he only learned of the murder after the fact.

  [Text] Hamas says it will not halt its Jihad against Israel 
in exchange for the release of its leader, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. 
Hamas is awaiting Israel's decision to release Palestinian 
prisoners, including Hamas prisoners. Hamas functionaries talk 
about accepting the Israel-PLO agreement, while its military arm 
insists on continuing the struggle against the occupation. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  On the eve of the signature of the agreement with the PLO, 
and after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has already withdrawn 
approximately 90 percent of its forces from the Gaza Strip and 
redeployed in the Qatif Bloc, the question remains, what will 
Hamas do? Over the last few months Israel has tried -- via IDF 
officers -- to open a sort of dialogue with Hamas. Major 
General Matan Vilna'i, commander of the Southern Command, and 
Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF forces in 
the Gaza Strip, have held several meetings with some Hamas 
leaders in the area. The two tried to come to an understanding 
of Hamas, attempted to soften it, occasionally resorting to 
threats -- but without much success. 
  Yesterday Hamas disgustedly rejected Foreign Minister Peres' 
proposal to release Hamas leader Ahmad Yasin in exchange for a 
call on his people to halt the acts of terrorism against Israel. 
Sources in the Gaza Strip say that apparently Israel does not 
realize that Yasin can no longer issue such an order to 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm. They claim that 
there is a growing rift within Hamas between some of the 
spiritual leaders and functionaries, and the fighters in the 
field, after agreement between the PLO and Hamas was signed. 
This agreement, which calls for cooperation in many areas, was 
signed by Rashid Abu-Shabak, leader of the Fatah Hawks, and 
Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is considered to be the leader of 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam. Sources in Gaza say that since this 
agreement was signed, differences of opinion have surfaced 
between the fighters in the field and the organization's 
spiritual leadership, with the former complaining that Fatah is 
removing them from work places, such as the busy works which 
Israel is financing in the territories. 
  Despite all the denials coming from the direction of Fatah, 
and the calming statements issued by Musa Abu-Marzuq, a Hamas 
functionary residing in Jordan, it transpires that the limited 
agreement between the PLO and Hamas will not prevent attacks in 
Israel and in the territories, excluding the areas of Gaza and 
Jericho which will be under the PLO's control.

  [Text] London, April 29, SPA -- A delegation comprises of 
heads of Islamic diplomatic missions in London held a meeting 
here today with the British state Minister Foreign Affairs 
Douglas Hogg and the talks dealt with the latest developments of 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The team groups the heads of diplomatic missions of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey, Senegal, Pakistan, 
Egypt, and Iran. The seven countries are members of the liaison 
group assigned by the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC) [Islamic Comference Organization -- ICO] to deal with the 
the Bosnian crisis. 
  A statement issued afterwards said the delegation conveyed 
to 
the British minister the grave concern of the OIC's member 
states on the continuing attacks waged by the Serbian forces on 
the city of Gorzade which was delcared as a safe haven by the 
United Nations. 
  The delegation also briefed the Mr. Hogg [as received] on 
the 
contents of the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the 
liasion group after a meeting in New York on the Bosnian issue 
last Wednesday. 
  The statement of the foreign ministers of the seven OIC's 
member states expressed the anger and anxiety of the OIC's 
member states on the current Bosnian situation and called on for 
immediate lift of the arms embargo imposed on the republic of 
Bonsia-Herzegovina and enabling the Bosnian people of exercising 
their legitimate right of self-defense according to Article 51 
of the U.N. Charter. 
  The ministers welcomed the ultimatum issued by the NATO on 
April 22 for protection of safe havens and called on for

Republic and the ministers confirmed the readiness of the OIC's 
states to provide adequate number of land troops for the 
purpose. 
  The statement said the ministers also expressed the OIC's 
support for the idea of holding an international conference for 
peace in former Yugoslavia providing that the Serbs would not be 
allowed to exploit the meeting as cover for their expanionist 
plots. 
  At the end of the meeting, the British minister promised to 
keep the team acquainted with the developments on the matter and 
to consult with them on new development concerning the crisis.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 April 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Asyut Group Escalates Operations, Suhaj Group Seeks 
Dialogue 
  2. Brotherhood Calls For Boycotting Serbian Supporters 
  3. Islamists To Run University Professors' Club Elections 
  4. Writer Advocates Mediation Between Police, Islamists 
  5. Government Policies Seen as Cause for Violence 
  6. Birth Control Seen as Conspiracy Against Muslim Nation 
  7. Ennahda Leader Interviewed on Tunisian Situation, 
Prospects 
<H5>  ASYUT GROUP ESCALATES OPERATIONS, SUHAJ GROUP SEEKS DIALOGUE </H5>
  A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi 
on 
pages 1 and 7 says that the Islamic Group has claimed 
responsibility for the assassination of Brigadier General Shirin 
'Ali Fahmi, commander of Asyut security forces, and his 
bodyguard. "In a statement faxed to AL-SHA'B" the group said 
this was "the sixth in a series of operations to confront human 
right violations in prisons." 
  The report cites a statement issued by the Islamic Group in 
Suhaj "denouncing violence and the killing of innocent people", 
originally published in the London-based AL-HAYAH. Issued at a 
seminar in Suhaj, Upper Egypt, the statement affirms that the 
Islamic Group "does not object to engaging in any dialogue to 
solve problems" and that "it calls for laying down arms, 
renouncing violence, and resorting to law, reason, and logic to 
contain the crisis." 
  The report also notes that "the security service in Asyut 
has 
discovered a detective in the Dayrut police station who 
cooperates with the Islamic Group." The detained detective 
revealed that "other officers are working for the Islamic 
Group," the report says. 
<H5>  BROTHERHOOD CALLS FOR BOYCOTTING SERBIAN SUPPORTERS </H5>
  An unattributed 100-word report on page 7 notes that "the 
Muslim Brotherhood has called on all Muslims to declare a 
political and economic boycott of the states that support the 
Serbian aggression against the Bosnian Muslims." The 
Brotherhood suggests that specialized institutions be set up in 
individual states to "supervise the boycott measures." 
  The report adds that the Brotherhood blames the major states 
and the United Nations for Serbian crimes and condemns the 
"failure and capitulation of the officials in the Arab and 
Muslim worlds in their stance on the Serbian aggression." 
  ISLAMISTS TO RUN UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS' CLUB ELECTIONS 
  A 150-word report by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad on pages 1 and 7 
says that "current Islamic representatives" will hold elections 
this month to select members of the professors' clubs at the 
universities of Cairo and al-Zaqaziq. 
  WRITER ADVOCATES MEDIATION BETWEEN POLICE, ISLAMISTS 
  In a 1,200-word article on page 9, Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh 
expresses surprise at the "persisting bloodshed and series of 
mutual executions between police and Islamic groups." He 
regrets the absence of "serious and sincere attempts" to end 
this situation, since the victims are always the sons of the 
Egyptian nation. 
  He notes that security campaigns will not succeed in 
overcoming extremism, since prevailing conditions provide 
adequate soil for the growth of more violence. He argues that 
the only approach guaranteed to put an end to this bloodshed is 
mediation by Muslim scholars to reconcile the two sides. 

<H5>    GOVERNMENT POLICIES SEEN AS CAUSE FOR VIOLENCE </H5>
  In a 2,000-word article on page 3, Dr. Rafiq Habib argues 
that "terrorism has become an excuse for sustaining the ruling 
regime and justifying Mubarak's continued to rule." He says 
that the regime has divided Egyptian society into "terrorists 
and non-terrorists," the latter being the government which, 
protected by the law and the media, tightens its grip on all and 
remains unaccountable. 
  Habib adds that it is wrong to believe the government media 
campaign, which alleges that we are up against a terrorist 
phenomenon financed by foreign states. He contends that this 
campaign seeks to present the situation as a battle between the 
Islamic groups and society, thereby authorizing the government 
to play the role of the policeman who protects society. But the 
truth is that these groups are against the government, not the 
people; they are working to overthrow the regime. 
  The writer says "the armed Islamic protest" provides strong 
evidence that "the regime is no longer capable of realizing 
society's aspirations" and that the present policies divide 
society and make violence the only effective approach. 
  Habib says that the problem lies in the fact that "we are 
subject to imported values and are being ruled by a regime that 
draws its legitimacy from Western systems at a time when our 
original values are buried inside us." He adds that the 
policies of the present regime are merely fulfilling the terms 
of the West, from which the regime benefits in the form of 
financial and political support. 
  Finally, he calls for rectifying the basic causes of unrest 
and for reevaluating the government policy in order to avoid 
further bloodshed. He advises the regime to ally with the 
people instead of the West. 
<H5>  BIRTH CONTROL SEEN AS CONSPIRACY AGAINST MUSLIM NATION </H5>
  In a 4,000-word article on page 5, Labor Party Secretary 
General 'Adil Husayn writes about the UN population conference 
recently held in Cairo. Citing the Koranic verse "there is no 
moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependenth on God," 
he says the old Western call to curb the population increase in 
order to save limited resources runs counter to God's promise to 
provide all creatures with their needs. 
  Showing how the world population balance shifted in favor of 
the "oppressed world" in the 1950's, he argues that this shift 
is part of "the heavenly arrangements that herald the 
approaching triumph of the faithful." The pharaohs and tyrants 
of this age reject this and seek to change it as much as they 
can. He notes that "they are plotting to annihilate mankind on 
our continents, with the Islamic nation heading their targets, 
of course." 
  Husayn contends that birth control in the Arab and Muslim 
world is unjustified, since Arab and Muslim populations are not 
large enough to exploit the abundant natural and financial 
resources. 
  He believes that the people should stand up to the "official 
media" to prove that increasing our birth rate is "a blessing 
that warrants no regret or apology." He expects the population 
policy to be completely different "when patriotic Islamists" 
rule the country. 
<H5>  ENNAHDA LEADER INTERVIEWED ON SITUATION, PROSPECTS </H5>
  In a 1,500-word interview with Ennahda leader Rached 
Ghannouchi in Tunis by Lutfi Bin-Ramadan, published on page 8, 
Ghannouchi relates how the government, fearing the Islamic 
movement's success in the 1989 elections, set out to uproot 
Islamists in collaboration with the communists and all 
anti-Muslim currents. Describing the situation in the wake of 
recent elections, Ghannouchi says that "it is a battle between a 
corrupt, totalitarian dictatorship and a civilian society with 
all its Islamic, secular, and patriotic categories that struggle 
for their public and private political and religious freedoms." 
He expects these "farcical elections to inspire a national 
front involving all the factors of the civilian society to fight 
dictatorship until the people's will is liberated." 
  Arguing that the people's boycott of the elections indicates 
a public rejection of the ideas and personalities imposed on 
them, Ghannoouchi says that "the apparent state of peace is 
merely the lull that precedes the storm." Although the regime 
has exploited world conditions that are going against Islam and 
the Islamic movement, the liberal and democratic powers inside 
and outside the country realize that the battle against 
fundamentalism is only a pretext for the regime's suppression of 
public and individual freedoms. It is opening the door to 
corrupt currents, he says. 
  Touching on the situation in Algeria, Ghannouchi notes that 
Algeria enjoys a distinctive status in the Arab Maghreb. He 
believes that the situation in Algeria is ready for an 
inevitable change and that "the Islamists are coming under the 
leadership of the Islamic Salvation Front." Because of its 
fragility, Tunisia will be the most affected by what happens in 
Algeria, he adds. 
  Ghannoouchi wishes the Tunisian regime had been as flexible, 
prudent, and clever as the Jordanian or Moroccan regimes in 
dealing with the inevitably escalating Islamic current. "It 
could have achieved a degree of openness and freedom of change, 
cleared the political climate, and engaged in a serious dialogue 
with all the cultural and social powers to develop a coexistence 
formula," he says. However, he finds it unlikely the regime 
will take such a rational course.

  [Excerpts] The Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance 
[Hizballah parliamentary group] has described U.S. Beirut 
Ambassador Mark Hambley's moves as "unacceptable defiance of our 
people's feelings" and indicated that "it is the misfortune of 
our time that the government is in a comatose state" regarding 
what it described as the U.S. Ambassador's provocations. 
[passage omitted] 
  The bloc noticed that Ambassador Hambley's actions with 
respect to official quarters and his conveying to them of 
warnings and threatening messages under the guise of calming the 
situation and self-restraint aim "to undermine our people's 
steadfastness and their valiant resistance, which alone 
shoulders the responsibility for liberation and the honor of 
confronting the enemy's designs." 
  The bloc said "we believe these suspicious moves by this 
U.S. 
diplomat constitute unacceptable defiance of our people's 
feelings and impermissible intervention in the country's 
domestic affairs. It is the misfortune of our time that the 
government is in a comatose state regarding the U.S. 
ambassador's provocations. It is natural that this ambassador 
not be allowed to hurt the people's feelings and insult their 
dignity." [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic on 15 April 
publishes on page 5 an approximately 200-word report on a speech 
delivered by Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im 
Qasim during a ceremony held at Beirut's Arab University on 
Wednesday, 13 April, to honor excellent students. Shaykh Qasim 
says in part: "The media ban imposed by the Lebanese Government 
aims to deflect attention from the case of the perpetrators of 
the church massacre, and to pave the way for Lebanon to 
normalize relations with Israel." 
  On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 
350-word report on a speech by 'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of 
Hizballah's Political Bureau, at a ceremony organized by 
Hizballah on the occasion marking the 14th anniversary of the 
martyrdom of Scholar Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr. 
Al-Musawi says: "The law on the reorganization of the media is 
primarily aimed at silencing the voices rejecting the peace plan 
with the enemy." He adds that "the resistance is the chief 
loser from closing radios, because without radios, the 
resistance cannot communicate with its masses and society." 
Al-Musawi calls "for confronting the government's decision 
which portends grave consequences." 
  Pointing to the ongoing "capitulationist" process, al-Musawi 
says: "Sixty people were recently killed in al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron. What have the Arab rulers done regarding crime?" 
The Hizballah official goes on to say: "The Arab regimes were 
more embarrassed than the Zionists by this massacre. This is 
because the Arabs made a treasonous decision. These crimes 
expose their treason and collusion. What kind of peace are they 
talking about after this massacre which was committed during the 
ongoing negotiations which are imposed on the Arabs? Had this 
peace been a true peace, they would have allowed us to have our 
say. But they want to repress every voice in the name of 
stability. They are accusing us of plotting against Lebanon. 
Even if for the sake of argument we agree that the logic of 
negotiations is sound, we would still be wrong to lay down our 
weapons while the enemy owns the most sophisticated planes in 
the world and even nuclear weapons." 
  On another memorial ceremony for martyr al-Sadr held in Burj 
al-Barajinah in Beirut, AL-'AHD publishes on page 5 an 
approximately 650-word report on an address by Shaykh Muhammad 
Yazbik, member of the Hizballah leadership council. After 
underlining the feats of the martyr and criticizing the "plot" 
against the media, Shaykh Yazbik says: "This plot is a coup 
against the nationalists in Lebanon and a conspiracy to abrogate 
Lebanon." He adds: "We will not allow this plot to be 
implemented against our kinsfolk and people." Shaykh Yazbik 
adds: "If they believe that they are paving the way for a peace 
settlement, I tell them that they will not succeed in doing so. 
Our reply to the Zionist enemy's attacks and massacres will be 
carried out in the form of suicide operations by the mujahidin 
in the occupied territories and in the form of qualitative 
operations by the Islamic resistance." 
  In a similar memorial ceremony held in Damascus, Ayatollah 
Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah delivered an approximately 2,000-word 
speech. After devoting the bulk of the address to the occasion, 
Fadlallah turns to the ongoing peace process. He says: "There 
is much talk, and as al-Sadat used to say, that there can be no 
solution without the United States. We have seen the U.S. 
solution in Egypt, and we also know the U.S. solution 
everywhere, including the current one in Palestine. The U.S. 
solution is the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which gives the 
Palestinians neither a homeland nor a state." Continuing, 
Fadlallah says: "They say that innocent people were killed in 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque and in the Israeli bus. But is there any Jew 
in Palestine whom you could call innocent? The issue is not one 
of carrying arms. He who seized the Palestinian land is an 
enemy. He who confiscated the Palestinian house and built a 
settlement on the Palestinian land is an enemy. But the United 
States wants to convince us that they are innocent." Fadlallah 
adds: "The United States wants to place the entire region under 
its control, including the region's riches, human beings, land, 
policies, economy, and security. The United States seeks to 
revoke everything called the Arab world." 
  In a 1,000-word statement on page 6 issued at the end of its 
ordinary meeting, the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance 
[Hizballah's parliamentary group], notes that "the government's 
decision serves the conspiratorial scheme targeted against the 
country's principal issues, foremost being the issue of 
liberation and resistance." The Bloc concludes its statement, 
saying: "With all objectiveness, resolve, and determination, we 
call for the cancellation of the government's recent decision 
concerning the ban of newscasts and political programs, and we 
will make every effort, and everyone is responsible, to wage the 
battle of media freedoms until the government reverses its 
decisions." 
  A 500-word interview is carried on page 9 with Dr. 'Ali 
al-Shaykh 'Ammar, deputy head of the Islamic Group Political 
Bureau. 'Ammar discusses the ministerial measures concerning 
the private radios and says: "These measures involve all of 
Lebanon and the Lebanese people and they will have impact on 
Lebanon's future and status and on the role being played by the 
resistance in confronting the Jewish plan in the region. These 
measures should not be allowed to preempt or circumvent the 
various effective and influential forces in Lebanon."

  [Text] Beirut, April 29, IRNA -- Lebanese prominent 
religious scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in his Friday prayer 
address today in south Lebanon attacked the hostile policy of 
the US towards the Islamic Republic of Iran. He termed the 
recent accusations levelled against Iran by US Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher as baseless and false. 
  "Yes, Iran supports freedom fighters and Muslims in Lebanon, 
Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and if those who struggle for 
freedom and for liberation of their lands are terrorist in the 
U.S. view, then Americans are also terrorits because they fought 
the British colonizers," Fadlallah argued. He said Iran does 
not support terrorism, but it has supported the liberation 
movements. Under the pretext that Iran has taken a negative 
stand towards the peace process, the U.S. has always called to 
ostracize and impose sanctions on Iran, but Iran's view is to 
create peace among the oppressed nations.

  [Text] On instructions from the judicial judge 
investigating the assassination of engineer Dany Sham'un and his 
family, forensic doctor Subhi Germanus this afternoon examined 
Samir Ja'ja', commander of the dissolved Lebanese Forces, in his 
place of detention to determine his health. This was done in 
response to a request by his lawyer, As'ad Abu-Ra'd. 
  The checkup proved that his health is very good, that his 
condition is normal, and that his heart rate and blood pressure 
are normal. He is in good health. The forensic doctor will 
submit a report to judicial investigator Judge Hunayn to be 
added to the investigation file. 
  It should be recalled that the jail in al-Yarzah has the 
necessary health facilities and a doctor visits the prisoners 
daily to check their health.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Dr. Sayyid 'Ali from Beirut; date not </F>
given--recorded] 
  [Text] Viktor Gogitidze, the official in charge of Middle 
Eastern affairs at the Russian Foreign Ministry, recently said: 
Our history of relations in the Middle East cannot be erased. 
We are determined to establish even-handed and balanced 
relations in the Middle East. 
  It is clear that Russia is on its way to lending a helping 
hand to its old allies. In a move calculated to express its 
traditional support for the Palestinians while keeping other 
lines of communication open, Russia played host to Israeli 
officials and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. The Russians want to 
resume their superpower role in the Middle East but have clearly 
abandoned the old ways of Soviet diplomacy. 
  In a recent visit to Damascus, Oleg Soskovets, Russian first 
deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, signed a military 
cooperation agreement. The agreement is expected to give a 
strong boost to Syrian-Russian relations and reverse the 
lassitude that has characterized these relations since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  Emerging from a three-hour meeting with President Hafiz 
al-Asad, Soskovets expressed great satisfaction with the visit. 
He and Syrian Defense Minister General Mustafa Talas had just 
signed an agreement on military cooperation. Gen. Talas praised 
the agreement, without disclosing its contents, describing it as 
a step in the right direction. The Syrian defense minister 
expressed hope that ties between Damascus and Moscow would 
return to the level experienced before the collapse of the 
Soviet Union in 1991.

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak received a telephone call 
this evening from Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
during which he explained to the president the worsening 
situation in fraternal Yemen. President Mubarak requested that 
the Yemeni parties end the fighting, solve the crisis through 
mutual understanding, and respond to the Egyptian and Arab peace 
efforts to safeguard the supreme interests of the fraternal 
Yemeni people. 
  Meanwhile, southern Yemeni sources have stated that fighting 
broke out again today between the southern and northern military 
units, and extended to southern areas of Yemen. The sources 
added that the current fighting is taking place in the southern 
provinces of Abyan and Lahij. 
  The Yemeni Defense Ministry in Sanaa said in a statement 
today that the southern forces deployed in the Dhamar base, 
south of Sanaa, have left their camps and have taken up 
positions in the surrounding areas on the orders of the leaders 
of the Socialist Party to aggravate the military situation in 
Yemen. 
  Informed sources in Sanaa said that an extensive search is 
under way in the Amran camp area, north of Sanaa, which 
witnessed heavy fighting last Wednesday and Thursday [27-28 
April], for Colonel Sayf al-Baqari, commander of the southern 
3rd Armored brigade, to bring him to court martial for issuing 
the orders to start the fighting in the area.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA) -- President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak has addressed an appeal to Yemeni leaders to stop the 
fighting among the Yemeni Armed Forces. 
  In his appeal, the president warned that the persistence of 
the armed clashes will further aggravate the situation and 
inflict grave harm on fraternal Yemen's present and future. 
  President Mubarak called on the Yemeni leaders to return the 
northern and southern armed troops to their positions to stop 
the ongoing fighting that has killed and wounded hundreds in the 
past few days. 
  The president called on President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, in 
his capacity as president and higher commander of the Armed 
Forces, to intervene with his wisdom to stop the fighting in the 
northern part of the country and to organize matters in a manner 
that averts friction and provocation and preserves Yemen's unity 
and the higher interests of its sons. 
  Concluding his appeal, President Mubarak appealed to the 
Yemeni leaders to restrain themselves, engage in a rational and 
logical dialogue, and respond to efforts to preserve Yemen's 
wellbeing and the unity of its sons.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Muhammad Husni Mubarak marking Labor </F>
Day at the General Organization for Mobilization and Statistics 
in Madinat al-Nasr, Cairo, on 28 April--live] 
  [Text] [Mubarak] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Many happy returns of the day. 
  [Unidentified member of audience] Many happy returns of the 
day, Mr. President. May God preserve you for us and for Egypt 
and may He protect Egypt and Mubarak. 
  [Mubarak] Thank you. Before I begin my speech on the 
occasion marking Labor Day, I would like to address thanks, 
greetings, and appreciation to the brother ministers who served 
a long time in the government [applause] and performed very 
difficult tasks when there have been countless problems. Among 
these I would like to mention Engineer Hasaballah al-Kafrawi, 
who served for 16 years. [applause] No one can forget what he 
did for new communities, worn-out utilities, housing and housing 
units. His work is evident to all. Engineer Jamal al-Sayyid 
was a minister of war production. He did his job. Engineer 
'Isam Radi and Engineer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Wahhab was industry 
minister when all our factories, particularly in the public 
sector, needed development, renovation, and replacement. He put 
in great efforts in this connection. Mr. Fu'ad Sultan, [former] 
minister of tourism and civil aviation [applause] made huge 
efforts, which we all know. Dr. Raghib Duwaydar in the field of 
health and the development of hospitals and Mr. 'Adil 'Izz and 
his efforts in scientific research, and Mr. Yusri 'Ali Mustafa, 
who was economy minister at a time when economic reform was 
being studied and launched. That was a great effort. Dr. Ahmad 
Salamah was minister of local government and the People's 
Assembly's affairs. Mr. 'Asim 'Abd-al-Haqq was minister of 
labor and manpower for seven years. Mr. Maurice Makramallah 
worked as minister of international cooperation. I express my 
personal appreciation to the ministers, who worked for long 
periods and withstood harsh criticism, inquiries, and questions. 
They are relieved of these things now. [audience applauds, 
laughs, and chants slogans] 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  [Unidentified member of audience] Long live Mubarak, the man 
of peace, the leader of the Arab nation and Africa. 
  [Mubarak] And Europe too. [audience laughs, applauds] 
  [Unidentified member of audience] Mr. President, this is an 
expression of your gratitude as a loyal Egyptian. You 
appreciated the efforts of those who served and gave to Egypt. 
This is an expression of your gratitude. We want another 
expression of appreciation for the workers who have been 
pensioned off and have yet to cash their pension checks. We 
want a sign of gratitude from Your Excellency to these people 
who retired in 1993 from their jobs in press institutions, 
particularly the Dar al-Hilal publishing house. I hope Your 
Excellency.... 
  [Mubarak, interrupting] These issues should be discussed 
with 
the government and not during a public speech. Thank you. 
[applause] 
  [Unidentified member of audience] I approached all officials 
and they did nothing. 
  [Mubarak] Press institutions have their own system. I do not 
think pensions were late without a specific reason. 
  [Unidentified member of audience] They did not pay their 
contributions to the Press Association. 
  [Mubarak] If they did not pay, we can look into the matter. 
If the institutions have not paid, they are independent 
institutions. 
  [Unidentified member of audience] They deducted the money 
from us, Mr. President. The deduction is obligatory. [words 
indistinct] meet with Your Excellency. 
  [Mubarak, laughing] You are welcome. Brother citizens, 
Egypt's loyal workers and sons; when man fairly views the major 
accomplishments that have a tangible impact all over Egypt, he 
can only say to the workers of Egypt on their day: Thank you 
for all you have offered to the homeland. Thank you for the 
generous sweat that sowed the seeds for a brighter future on 
Egyptian soil and a here-and-now rich with thousands of new 
projects. These projects enhance the homeland's production 
capability, provide more job opportunities to the homeland's 
sons, and revive Egypt's aspirations for a better future. 
  Through unparalleled persistent efforts over two successive 
development plans, Egyptian workers managed to execute a huge 
investment program that paved the way for a third plan, now 
under way, representing a staging point in the society's life. 
Completion of this plan means upgrading the living standard of 
the Egyptian citizen, promoting social solidarity, confronting 
unemployment problems properly, and achieving a fair regional 
balance in developing Egyptian governorates. 
  I express my great pride in the Egyptian workers who 
achieved 
this and built edifices of work and production for Egypt and who 
set an example in their awareness of the need for the country to 
be stable so that it can progress. They strongly supported the 
economic reform programs in the production institutions and 
maintained the unity of their struggle, clinging to patriotism 
that protected their ranks from sedition and division. 
  The Egyptian workers maintained their struggle's 
independence 
and uniqueness so that their struggle can remain aloof from 
parties and affiliations with ideologies and doctrines and can 
incorporate all Egyptian workers in one nationalistic fold. The 
Egyptian workers preserved their movement's unity and 
independence when they rejected doctrinal interference in their 
trade unions and when they refused to let these national 
institutions be a stage for party or ideological conflict that 
would break the workers' unity and divert their struggle from 
this great nation's values. [applause] 
  The Egyptian workers abandoned the ideas of dispute and 
conflict despite efforts by numerous political forces that tried 
to exploit the workers' struggle to foment class conflict. They 
also abandoned the ideas of darkness and destruction that seek 
to wreck the nation's strength. 
  The Egyptian workers' will has triumphed and their trade 
organizations supported this nation's values which advocate 
construction and cooperation, reject conflicts and disputes, and 
call for a balance between rights and interests. 
  May God keep for Egypt its loyal workers who preserved 
Egypt's security and stability so that Egypt kept them in its 
heart and mind. [applause] 
  Brother workers, your anniversary is a day of hope and 
Egyptian nationalism. I have hoped and still hope that Egyptian 
nationalism will triumph over the elements of destruction and 
division. I also hope that the nation's interests will be the 
right criterion by which we gauge the legitimacy of actions and 
sincerity of positions. The aim is to achieve a sound national 
reconciliation that charts the boundaries between the right to 
variance in views, a legitimate right guaranteed by the 
democratic regime, and the calls of incitement, conspiracy, and 
violence that tamper with the country's security and jeopardize 
its social peace. 
  I do not see this as a difficult or impossible task. Despite 
the differences that might emerge from varying political views 
on the stage of national action, there are still numerous common 
factors that help reach a common understanding of the higher 
national interest and make national reconciliation possible. 
  We might disagree on which should come first on the list of 
national priorities, economic or political reform. But we 
cannot disagree on the need to incriminate violence, killing, 
and sabotage out of respect for legitimacy and the supremacy of 
the law. We might disagree on how big a role the state can play 
in steering the national economy, but we cannot disagree on the 
state's duty to take care of the less capable classes out of 
eagerness to preserve the homeland's unity and its social 
justice. [applause] 
  We might disagree on some of the laws that organize our 
political life, but we cannot disagree on Egypt's need under the 
prevailing conditions for a cohesive society whose powers are 
intertwined in a just framework that preserves the balance among 
the interests of the various categories of the people and opens 
the way for initiatives by various individuals. 
  Thus, brothers and sisters, I made the call for a national 
dialogue involving all the democratic powers and political 
institutions that respect legitimacy and the law. The objective 
of the dialogue has never been national reconciliation, because 
the state is at odds only with those who are outside legitimacy 
and the law. The supporters of violence among the terrorist 
groups have made threatening the security of the homeland and 
citizens and damaging the people's interests their first 
priority in implementing foreign plots that aim to weaken Egypt 
and impede its progress. These groups are not a party to the 
dialogue and not the object of national reconciliation. There 
can be no dialogue with killers and no reconciliation with 
murderers. Evil has controlled these criminals so strongly that 
they started to terrorize society, kill innocent people, and 
commit despicable crimes that shame every Muslim who is zealous 
for his religion, homeland, and society. 
  Dialogue is not meant to open back doors for illegitimate 
powers that mix religion with political activity to put 
themselves above the law, antagonize and fight the multiparty 
system until they monopolize the national arena, and pounce on 
the chance to rule, kill democracy, and let one view and one 
line of thinking do away with every thinker who dares oppose or 
discuss. 
  Dialogue has always meant to fulfill one last prerequisite 
of 
democracy. Democracy does not mean a chaos of views that 
threaten the homeland's interest or destroy its unity and power. 
Democracy does not mean confusing the dividing lines between 
legitimate powers that operate within a democratic system that 
make it imperative to respect the law and other illegitimate 
powers that advocate violence and destroy the society's 
peacefulness and stability. Authentic democracy can only 
fulfill its prerequisites when the legitimate political powers 
seek a clear-cut agreement that determines the homeland's 
genuine interests and priorities, provides the guarantees that 
safeguard the democratic action march against those who want to 
pounce on it, and creates favorable conditions in the society 
for a degree of national consensus that guarantees the balance 
of the political march and distinguishes between the legal and 
illegal to avoid confusion of stands, waste of the homeland's 
interests, and turning democracy into a kind of anarchy that 
paralyses the society's ability to face up to challenges. This 
will never be. 
  Brothers and sisters, I hope national dialogue will be 
candid and serious and that it will be preoccupied with the 
basic concerns of the homeland. I hope it will rise above 
narrow and limited individual party interests. I hope this 
dialogue will be based on a realistic and objective vision that 
interprets Egypt's priorities accurately, without ignoring the 
existing reality and the data provided over the course of 
history, floating in a vacuum with no consideration for the 
homeland's resources and capabilities, or risking the homeland's 
peace and stability to indulge empty slogans or imitate 
erroneous stances that practical experience has proved very 
serious for the national destiny. 
  Let us all take into account that democracy is not a single 
pattern or sacred preconception that can be applied here in 
exactly the same way that they are applied there. Every country 
has its unique conditions, reality, and course of development. 
Our sublime duty is to be honest with ourselves and to have a 
proper understanding in order to take the right course. We are 
carrying a heavy burden that leaves no room for adventures and 
we are still the target of many powers that do not want 
stability or progress in Egypt. 
  We do not avoid any commitment or promise nor do we back 
down 
on any decision. Democracy is our way of life and our 
irreversible course. However, we should draw attention to the 
need to learn from past lessons, ours and others' as well. We 
have to calculate our future steps correctly as we seek to 
enhance our democratic approach so that Egyptian society can 
continue to be a cohesive entity with interlinked powers. There 
can be no democracy, stability, or progress in a society where 
strife and discord prevail. 
  Brothers and sisters; I have committed myself to the service 
of this homeland, eschewing personal interests and ambitions. I 
fear no one but almighty God. I listen to no voice but my 
conscience and respond to no call but that of the homeland. I 
am well aware of the risks involved in taking steps without 
making calculations, a thing that can, God forbid, cause a 
setback, particularly as we are going through a stage of 
considerable change. This might be the most serious stages of 
transformation in all Egyptian history. The world provides 
numerous examples that prove that my fears are real. 
  Since taking on this responsibility, I have promised myself 
to put the homeland's interests above every other consideration. 
The responsibility is great and the burden heavy; they leave no 
room for risking the destiny of a nation or the future of a 
homeland just to satisfy empty, resonant slogans; they withstand 
no miscalculation to make rapid gains that will soon be carried 
away by the wind. 
  My major concern has always been to lead the ship to a safe 
haven under harsh and complex conditions that resulted from 
entangled local and foreign factors that aggravated problems. 
Under these harsh conditions, which you all know, Egypt's 
greatest and most crucial transformations over history have 
occurred. Democratic practice in Egypt was expanded to 
unprecedented bounds; rightist, leftist, and moderate political 
powers competed in the arena under the umbrella of a free press 
and independent judiciary. The Egyptian economy broke free of 
the fetters that restricted its ability and hampered the 
rejuvenation of its powers, and even limited its activity to 
state efforts. Closed doors barred the contribution to 
development efforts by the nation's capital and local and 
foreign investors' capital. 
  Brothers and sisters, we have shouldered and continue to 
shoulder some difficulties imposed on us by the burdens of this 
stage of changes and reforms. But the ship has passed the 
danger point and reached the shore of safety, hoisting the 
banner of a homeland that has restored its ability to achieve a 
comprehensive development that grows annually to raise the 
living standards of its sons, provide more job opportunities, 
and ensure stability and security for everyone. Our great 
people have succeeded in achieving in very few years a miracle 
that has changed the situation of Egypt, which was on the verge 
of collapse. It has now become attractive to investments that 
are increasingly flowing in year after year. The country's 
revenues from its national production are increasing in quantity 
and quality and this underlines the Egyptian economy's ability 
to achieve its desired takeoff. 
  The destructive activity that the terrorist groups continue 
to practice and this disloyalty to and disavowal of God and this 
homeland will neither change this truth nor eclipse it. Society 
as a whole has discovered the false and spurious allegations 
that these groups attribute to religion. It is evident to 
everyone that they are mere straying and unfair remnants who 
have no qualms about committing atrocious crimes and who let 
themselves do what God has forbidden. They are not deterred by 
religion or morals and are controlled by corrupt heads that have 
made terrorism a trade and an profession and corrupted the 
morals of a perplexed youth who were seeking the right path but 
were led astray, were seeking an honest living but were led to 
illegal seizure of money, and were seeking the true path but 
whose eyes were blinded and whose hearts ceased to feel. 
  Should such people be allowed to speak from the pulpits of 
mosques, to teach believers and the faithful in Egypt lessons in 
religion? Should a small group of hypocrites and deceivers be 
allowed to defend this criminality or present false excuses for 
their vile crimes? God Almighty is right when He says in his 
holy book: Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie 
against God? 
  Brothers and sisters, the time has come to place this 
phenomenon in its true perspective without any exaggeration, 
oversight, or underestimation, because this objective assessment 
that is committed to the facts is a necessary condition for the 
success of the confrontation. I say very clearly that there is 
nothing today in this phenomenon that causes fear about the 
homeland's future as long as the entire people stands united and 
massed in one rank and with full vigilance in confronting the 
straying and straggling groups that lack any popular support. 
The people condemn their actions and vile crimes after their 
role in damaging the homeland's interests have been exposed. 
Their role is to serve vile schemes that aim to impede Egypt's 
takeoff and abort the opportunities for progress. The noble 
Egyptian people will not allow these straggling and hireling 
remnants to dash its efforts and hopes of establishing a 
national and free society whose ability to satisfy the needs and 
ambitions of its sons increase daily. 
  I am confident that this phenomenon is temporary and will 
end. I don't say this from a vacuum but on the basis of the 
great Egyptian people's big successes. These people are 
confronting sedition after realizing its dangers and sins. 
Their vigilant vanguards and their establishments are standing 
against the danger, cautioning, warning, and enlightening. The 
concerned state authorities are hunting down the heads of the 
plot and aborting their schemes decisively and resolutely. 
Thanks to the people's support and vigilance, they have 
maintained the initiative in confronting these criminal 
individuals after the false masks behind which they were hiding 
have fallen. 
  The security forces will not stay idle or be lax in their 
confrontation with this evil affliction regardless of the 
seriousness of the challenges and dangers. The march of 
Egyptian patriotism will continue to march forward, declaring: 
We will save you, Egypt. [applause] 
  Brothers and sisters: We could have rooted out these groups 
and cut short the confrontation time. However, we are anxious 
for the state's measures to remain in a correct framework 
respecting the rules of democracy and adhering to the supremacy 
of law and the Constitution. 
  Recently Egyptian security forces have valiantly and 
strongly 
confronted this terrorist activity while firmly adhering to 
legality and law. The initiative now is in the hands of the 
security forces, which have penetrated this phenomenon in all 
its domestic and external dimensions by monitoring its contacts 
with its agents abroad and discovering the greatest part of its 
networks, hideouts, and plans. 
  I salute the policemen [applause] who have made honest and 
indefatigable efforts to safeguard the security of the homeland 
and citizens and who through the sacrifices of their innocent 
martyrs have been able to contain and abort this danger. I 
salute the great Egyptian people who have given the greatest 
help to the police forces, who have not missed a chance to 
expressing their anger and their condemnation of these groups, 
who have offered several innocent martyrs, fallen victim to 
treacherous crimes. I salute Egypt's intellectuals, writers, 
and artists who have not lost confidence in the homeland's 
ability to contain the danger and uproot it. They have not been 
afraid to perform their national task of revealing the ignorance 
of these groups and exposing their aims and motives. I call 
upon these misled groups to return to their conscience and to 
repent before it is too late. What is right is clear and what 
is wrong is also clear. Destruction and construction cannot go 
hand in hand. The homeland expects its sons to be a support for 
it and not wage war on it. 
  Brothers and sisters, I know as well as you do that the 
success of the Egyptian security services has offended some 
hypocritical groups, who have undertaken a frenzied bogus 
campaign to question every official and every accomplishment. 
They arouse animosity and hatred and spread despair. We have 
been careful to deal with them on the basis of the supremacy of 
the law without restricting their views, because we know that 
they are peddling a rotten commodity to an intelligent people 
who know how hypocritical they are. We are chasing out 
corruption everywhere, because honest rule is a noble commitment 
and we are not slighting one iota of this commitment. 
  But we judge no one on the basis of mere suspicion and heed 
no vindictive defamations. We leave the whole matter to a clean 
judiciary that examines accusations, thoroughly studies 
incidents, and issues independent verdicts influenced by no one 
or nothing except its own conscience and the law. The ruling 
process in Egypt has matured; people's fates are no longer 
determined on the basis of false rumors promoted by some people 
out of spite and personal grudges. The judiciary has assumed 
such a prominent status that it has become impossible for any 
official, no matter how high his position might be, to interfere 
in its judgements. [applause] 
  Old ways of thinking that viewed everyone who had some 
capital as a suspicious opportunist, thus forcing him to 
withhold his money from investments that benefit the people and 
society, have changed. Those who fabricate lies about corruption 
in Egypt deliberately overlook the state's role in uncovering 
corruption and rooting out criminals. Despite their exaggerated 
commotion, they fail to provide a shred of evidence to prove 
that the state has been slack in pursuing a single case of 
corruption. Corruption in Egypt is still limited to individual 
cases. No society in the world, no matter how perfect it might 
be, is free from such corruption. Corruption has not and will 
not develop into a problem in Egypt, as is the case was in many 
states which we all know. In these states, big groups have been 
involved in activities that cast doubt on the purity and 
cleanliness of the entire regime and threaten cohesion among 
state institutions. 
  This absolutely does not mean that we take corruption 
lightly 
or ignore it. We are determined to track it down and strike at 
it with the weapon of the law. The law is the judge and the 
decisive factor that we have all accepted in facing up to any 
illegal activity. 
  Free speech carries a responsibility and a trust. 
Responsible speech is a torch that lights the road for society 
and a deep-rooted tree with heaven-reaching branches. But the 
evil word is just like an evil tree that only bears malice and 
hatred. We do not ask that devious conduct or corruption be 
ignored or that infringement of society's rights go unpunished. 
We only ask that truthfulness and honesty be observed in 
reporting incidents, that facts be respected, and that things be 
put in their proper perspective without exaggeration or false, 
vindictive allegations. 
  Whenever there is nothing to talk about, they talk about 
corruption. No country in the world is free of corruption. I 
am not defending corruption. We allow no case of corruption 
that we learn of to go unpunished. We do not make judgements; 
we refer the cases to the judiciary. If it validates a charge, 
it issues a verdict. As you know, we do not interfere in the 
judiciary's affairs. There are some judges here among you. We 
never interfere. If a person is innocent, it is his rights that 
the judiciary protects. We overlook no case of corruption. I 
hope those who talk about corruption would look at themselves 
and those around them [laughter, applause] 
  They keep talking about corruption, why do they not look at 
themselves and those around them? If they are really clean, 
they can talk and we will listen to them. But if we catch them 
in the act.... [pauses] We do not want to violate the law. 
[applause] 
  Brother and sister workers of Egypt, this day is for us, as 
it is our annual custom to review the achievements, the 
difficulties, and the obstacles we have faced in order to learn 
from them. We are continuing to constantly develop our 
intrinsic resources and look toward a better future that will 
provide opportunities for fruitful work for our sons, raise 
people's income to a level commensurate with their burdens, and 
enable society to have stability and true democracy that give 
momentum to the march of progress. 
  I believe that we are capable of fulfilling these hopes with 
the helping hands of every honest Egyptian citizen and of adding 
to the edifice with the sweat of workers, farmers, scholars, 
intellectuals, businessmen, and experts. We have completed the 
biggest and most difficult stage, rectified the course of the 
national economy, tackled most of the imbalances that impeded 
the economy's ability to grow, and raised production efficiency 
when we began to implement a vast investment program that 
exceeded two billion Egyptian pounds. This has enabled our 
society to implement an ambitious and comprehensive development 
plan whose benefits are steadily growing as a result of 
initiatives taken by individuals. 
  You are all aware of what the situation was in 1982 when I 
took over responsibility; but now we have forgotten. There is 
everything now: water, sewage, telephones, railroads, roads, 
more houses being built, expanding agricultural lands, 
industries, and newly built cities. Have we forgotten that none 
of this existed then and how no one came to invest? Even 
Egyptians did not come forward to invest. There were no 
telephones, roads, electricity, water, sewage, or even houses. 
I remember that I once toured the outskirts of Heliopolis, near 
Nasr city, where many houses had been built, but no one wanted 
to live in them. Why? Because there was no water, no drains, 
no electricity, nothing at all. Have you forgotten about the 
telephone problem? I am only reminding you. You are not young 
and you know all this; you saw all these things. Take the 
telephones. We had half a million lines, of which 200,000 were 
in working order. Today we have 3 million lines. Take the 
railroads, irrigation, agriculture. In irrigation alone, 4,000 
km of canals have been built in the past 10 years. Take, for 
example, the houses that were built in the new cities. Look at 
the industries established there. Look at the agriculture. But 
we forget. If one can remember where we stood and where we are 
today, then he can see how great this achievement has been. It 
is you who have done it. Don't think that I have done it. No, 
you have done it. It has all been Egyptian planning and work. 
[applause] 
  The expenditure on the infrastructure for the past 
development plans was 204 billion pounds. The expenditure for 
the current plan will be another 200 billion pounds. These are 
vast sums because our problems have been accumulating for 50, 60 
years. We had either to confront them or perish. I told you so 
in the past. We have been forced to confront them even though 
huge resources were needed. 
  Now you see them mocking the finance minister and the taxes. 
But where should we get these resources? [audience laughs] 
Should we steal? Should we borrow? But we have to pay the 
loans back or else collapse. It is as clear as that. It is our 
fate that we are facing 60 years of difficulties and we must act 
and therefore suffer. This generation has to suffer whether we 
like it or not. What we are doing is in the people's interest. 
Wages, prices, and economic reform [words indistinct] increase 
in production, quality, and our well-planned privatization. 
  Today they are telling you this or that about privatization. 
No, brothers; everything we do is calculated. I am telling you 
this in front of the prime minister and the ministers. I was 
even speaking yesterday and asked if the boards of the companies 
that are in the red are being paid bonuses and I was told that 
they are not. [audience laughs, applauds] Maybe they were paid 
in the past and got away with it, but nothing of the sort 
happens now and I am saying this publicly. 
  However, as you can see, the board of directors of 
loss-making companies are resigning. We are not sparing anyone 
now. When the public sector began operation, they talked about 
whom we appointed. This may have happened because we were in a 
hurry. However afterward we began an evaluation to see if 
production had increased and if modernization had taken place. 
If not, we asked the board of directors to resign and we 
brought in other people. The people consider that the 
government's property does not belong to anyone. Therefore we 
sell shares to the citizens. We want the workers to gradually 
begin to buy shares. However, there are some huge organizations 
that cannot be privatized in the way you understand it. But if 
these organizations need more capital, let the citizens buy 
shares. For example, there is the Abu-Qir Company which offered 
6 million pounds worth of shares to the citizens. The shares 
were sold out in 48 hours because it is a profit-making company. 
Nobody wants to buy shares in a money-losing company. However, 
we are reforming such companies so that they will become 
profitable. 
  This huge investment program has had a positive effect on 
all 
aspects of Egyptian life because it covers all spheres with 
unprecedented unanimity. This program has increased the 
effectiveness of economic and financial reform policies, and 
this has changed the course of economic development in Egypt, 
giving the national economy increasing strength and flexibility, 
and encouraging the private sector, which is now responsible for 
half of the development projects. 
  The boards of directors of profit-making companies get 
money. 
[audience laughs] The boards of directors of unprofitable 
companies do not. [audience laughs] We reward the workers 
because they produce. 
  Brothers and sisters: It may be beneficial to give some 
examples to indicate the growing nature of Egypt's economic 
capabilities as a result of this huge investment program, which 
has given society a chance to produce and given it immunity to 
sudden fluctuations. Investment in agriculture and land 
reclamation amounts to 15 billion pounds. We have been able to 
add more land to the cultivated areas, which will reach 
1,200,000 feddans by the end of the third development plan in 
1997. The implementation of this program required digging 
canals and aqueducts. From 1982 to 1994 we dug about 4,000 km 
of aqueducts. By the year 2000 we will have dug another 2,000 
km. These 4,000 km are more than we have dug in the past 30, 
40, 50, 60 years. The implementation of this program required 
digging canals and aqueducts longer than the Nile River, and 
building one-fourth as many barrages as were built in Egypt 
since the time of Muhammad 'Ali. 
  I once visited a big country where they showed me a bridge. 
They told me it is the longest bridge over a river in the 
world. They said it is 2,100 meters long; I told them we have a 
2,300-meter-long bridge. [audience laughs] We actually have 
such a bridge in the north, near Disuq. They boasted they have 
a 2,000-meter-long bridge. I told them we have 2,200 and 
2,300-meter-long bridges. We have many bridges over the Nile. 
We have many bridges and barrages on the Nile, but the people 
forget. Television must enlighten the people on what is 
happening in their country so that they can be proud of their 
country. I am proud of my country because I know what is being 
done. Every citizen must know these things so that he will be 
proud of his country. 
  These great efforts have increased crop production which has 
brought the productivity of Egyptian soil near international 
standards. The production of sugar cane and rice has increased 
in recent years. The increase in production of these crops is 
the primary aim of the agricultural policy. These crops are the 
main food source and constitute a considerable part of the 
production requirements for several of our factories. We have 
increasing hopes that our agricultural exports will increase. 
  Brothers, I hear many voices saying we can cultivate the 
desert and eat wheat. But where would we get the water from? 
They say we can achieve self-sufficiency in wheat. From the 
lands cultivated at present? At the expense of rice, cotton, 
etc? I once read in a newspaper about some official in one of 
the councils asking: Why do we import fish when we have the 
Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea? Our coasts do not have fish. 
Why then do our fishermen from Damietta and Port Said go to 
Eritrea and Yemen to fish? We would not have to import fish if 
our seas were full of fish. In the past we had a fleet that 
sailed to Morocco to fish, but it operated at a loss. I do not 
know where they sold the fish. [audience laughs] 
  We should really understand. Yes we have a sea but we also 
have an economic market. This means you don't bring in large 
ships to fish when they can't catch any, otherwise you will have 
to pay the fishermen's wages, the ships will lose money, we will 
have to subsidize them with tax money; and they will only bring 
you 200 or 300 kgs of fish which, if you can sell it, will not 
cover even a small part of the expenditures. 
  We must understand well that we can never satisfy the 
demand. 
By God, we are increasing in number. Does this mean that we 
have to cultivate the desert every time our population 
increases? Where will I get water for this? All our water is 
enough for only 2 or 2.5 million feddans at most. And, my God, 
our population increases by between 12 and 13 million every year. 
  Increases in Egypt's crop production show how we can quickly 
reach the levels of world production and even surpass them if 
the efforts of farmers, workers, and the business sector come 
together. We are proud of the farmers and the great work they 
are doing for this homeland. They must take better care of 
their crops and take into account the recommendations of 
agricultural experts, especially in the wake of the 
liberalization of crop prices. The scientists in Egypt's 
universities, institutes, and research centers must work in the 
fields in order to apply the achievements of the agricultural 
revolution, which has permitted food self-sufficiency in many 
countries. The business sector, whose role in and contribution 
to the national economy is increasing, must invest more in the 
modern technology and services required to raise the Egyptian 
soil's productivity. The great success in the field of 
agricultural expansion and the obvious progress in the 
production cycle confirm the possibility of achieving similar 
success in diversifying our agricultural exports, which should 
be the second main objective of our agricultural policy. 
  I have issued instructions that we should begin planning 
right now under the direct supervision of an apparatus that is 
free of red tape and bureaucracy to seek ways of exploiting the 
new lands in Sinai so that they reach half a million feddans 
after completion of the peace canal project. 
  The comprehensive development of the Egyptian countryside is 
the third objective of our agricultural policy and this means 
focusing on economic activities that are connected to 
agriculture. It is not reasonable or acceptable to let 
development in Egypt's countryside be dependent on the 
production of agricultural crops alone, with half of Egypt's 
manpower being employed in this sector. In fact we have started 
experimenting in a number of villages in some governorates, and 
we will apply the results of these experiments or amending them 
in the light of accumulated experience so that development will 
encompass the whole Egyptian countryside. 
  Brothers and sisters, our hope becomes increasingly clear 
and bright when we review together the outcome of the huge 
effort undertaken in the field of industry. You are the heroes 
and the vanguard of this effort. This effort has proceeded in 
two parallel and complementary directions. The first course is 
the renovation and modernization of existing industrial plants 
that are suffering from wear and tear. The second course is the 
establishment of new industrial zones and equipment with all 
needed utilities and services so that they will be ready to 
receive the biggest number of factories. We have invested 34 
billion pounds in industry and mining over the past 11 years. 
Now we speak in terms of billions whereas before we spoke in 
terms of millions. In the past the biggest power station cost 
100 million pounds, now a power station such as Shubra 
al-Khaymah costs 1.2 billion pounds. A million has become like 
a shilling. [audience laughs] They invented new names for a 
million, instead of a rabbit and [words indistinct]. [audience 
laughs] 
  We have invested 42 billion pounds. We have built new 
industrial zones equipped with services and utilities. So far 
we have built 13 industrial new towns and five new communities, 
and we spent 3.3 billion pounds on providing them with 
utilities. By this investment we have been able to attract 
3,044 projects and factories in the towns of 10 Ramadan, 6 
October, al-Sadat city, Burj al-'Arab, and other areas. The 
Egyptian private sector has invested over 10 billion pounds in 
these towns, providing job opportunities for 170,000 Egyptians. 
  When investors start a project and we give them tax breaks, 
some people say reduce their exemptions. Our brothers in the 
People's Assembly sometimes say there is no need to provide tax 
exemptions--10 years is too much. I provide exemptions to an 
investor to encourage him to employ workers. As far as I am 
concerned, it is better for him to employ workers than to pay 
taxes. He will build houses. What I will do with the tax 
money? I want more houses; if he gives us more, I will treat 
him well. He provides livelihoods for the people and this 
brings happiness to the citizens. This is what we need. 
  Emphasis on industry has produced good results. Industry now 
constitutes 42 percent of total national investment. It 
contributes to 28 percent of the local production and absorbs 20 
percent of the Egyptian manpower expected to be employed during 
the years of the third five-year plan. 
  This success has encouraged us to establish new zones, which 
are being implemented within the framework of the third 
five-year plan. All necessary funds have been earmarked for 
establishing 12 new towns and industrial zones. If these towns 
are not established and the houses and factories not built, 
where will we be? We will be in a mess. The people will have 
no housing, no jobs, no livelihood. All of us must calmly 
remember what we have done. Where were we and where are we now? 
  In the first years we gave priority to the more needy 
governorates, above all the Upper Egypt governorates. We had 
faith in the need to intensify efforts in these areas after we 
felt the increasing desire of the citizens to invest in the 
first area allocated for this purpose, namely the industrial 
zone in Suhaj to which 73 investors have applied in the past 
three months. It is a new zone in Suhaj. We are creating new 
areas in Upper Egypt so our brothers will invest there. Some 
people from Upper Egypt want to invest in Cairo. Why don't you 
invest there. No, they want to invest here near Cairo. People 
want to escape from this Cairo. [audience laughs] It is 
crowded. We will find an agricultural project in Aswan for 
them. So 73 investors booked plots of land in Suhaj and began 
the measures to build their factories. 
  Brothers and sisters, our goal in the next few years is to 
make Egypt a leader among nations receiving industrial 
investments in the Middle East. The whole world is looking for 
investors, and I hope we will not drive them away. Some people 
say: Someone is driving a so and so car. So what, as long as he 
has got a legitimate business? You know how much duty he pays 
on his car? When he goes to clear his car from customs, Finance 
Minister al-Razzaz does not spare him. [audience laughs] He 
has to pay. Where does the money go? This makes up our 
revenue. I know that some people try to find a way out. Some 
people try to bring in cars on a trip ticket [previous two words 
in English], but we know how to deal with them. People have 
told me about this. I also heard something else which is very 
strange, and I told the finance minister about it a short while 
ago. Someone imports equipment the duty on which is 12,000 
pounds, for instance. He leaves the item in customs and tells 
them he does not want it. After a while, it will have to be 
sold at auction. In the meantime, he makes an arrangement with 
some people to buy it at the auction. If the duty on an item is 
12,000 for instance, they buy it for 2,000. Then the original 
buyer gives these people another 2,000 for profit and buys the 
item for 4,000, which does not cover the customs duty. So, you 
have to watch out for such tricks. [audience laughs] Someone 
told me about this last night. However, tricks are everywhere. 
I was abroad and everywhere I went I heard of similar tricks. 
All laws can be circumvented. We are human, after all. 
  Our goal in the next few years is to make Egypt a leader 
among nations receiving industrial investments in the Middle 
East and to be a major center of exports to all world markets. 
This means we must double our determination and efforts in 
several directions. 
  First: to continue our drive to remove all obstacles facing 
existing and new investments. I have heard much from investors, 
and I believe the government is working on measures in the field 
of production necessities and others related to the GATT, so 
that we can be competitive. We must develop our legislation and 
conditions to cope with the world trend so that we could find 
new markets. In our trips abroad we try to find markets. 
Everywhere I go I try to find markets. Hence the initiative I 
announced at the People's Assembly in November, when I called 
for abolishing all administrative procedures for projects with a 
capital that does not exceed five million pounds, so that all 
investors had to do was to inform the competent authority about 
their project. The Egyptians' response to this step has been 
excellent. During the past four months alone, 190 investors 
have applied for projects, to the tune of 410 million pounds, 
that will create 13,000 jobs. Naturally, the people do not want 
to go through lengthy procedures, whether in the electricity 
sector, investment authority, or whatever. I try to attend 
meetings of the investment committee to see what is happening. 
In one such meeting that I attended, I found a project 
submitted by two youngsters for approximately 260,000 pounds. 
They had been waiting for eight months. Why? So the idea 
crossed my mind. I said why don't we remove obstacles facing 
investors with capital up to five million pounds? All they need 
to do is find a plot of land in the new cities or in the desert, 
not on agricultural land, and then inform the authorities. Let 
them start and notify the investment authority, which cannot 
veto them. The investment authority's job is to process the 
papers for them so that they can qualify for the exemption. Now 
that this initiative has succeeded, I call on the government to 
raise the ceiling to 10 million pounds. [applause] The same 
procedures will apply. If you have a project to the tune of 10 
million pounds, inform the investment authority and start your 
project. There are many places in Upper Egypt. We have to make 
a breakthrough. If we do not run, we will be lost. The people 
abroad are running very fast to see where their interests are. 
If we sit still and do nothing, it will not work. 
  Second: to complete as quickly as possible establishing and 
equipping a third group of industrial zones. I believe that the 
government has taken measures to establish these zones in the 
areas north of the Gulf of Suez, Port Said, Damietta, and west 
of Alexandria. On my visits to foreign countries, I discuss 
this issue with interested countries. We have great hopes but 
this will take time. We have been working on this field since 
Reconstruction Minister al-Kafrawi has held this post. He knows 
the area north of the Gulf of Suez. The problem is that we 
cooperate with countries that are beset by bureaucracy much more 
than we are. We are establishing industrial zones in the area 
north of the Gulf of Suez, Port Said, Damietta, and west of 
Alexandria. We will also establish industrial zones in Upper 
Egypt. Anyone can invest in the industrial zones in Kafr 
al-Shaykh or any other area. These industrial zones are not 
confined to al-Minufiyah, al-Gharbiyah, or any other area. 
Anyone can establish projects anywhere and live in these areas. 
  Third: We will initiate a large international effort to make 
these areas permanent sites for completing industrialization, 
and stockpiling products, and distribution for international 
trade. I think I broached this issue during my visit to the 
PRC. We will try to benefit from world experience in 
establishing modern centers for marketing and training services 
and introducing technology into small projects in Egyptian 
cities and the countryside. 
  Our hopes for a better future do not stem from a void but 
from an objective assessment of the huge achievements that 
provide Egypt with enormous production centers that are prepared 
to accommodate thousands of new projects. I do not need to 
repeat the efforts we have exerted and the resources we have 
allocated to rebuild the infrastructure, which had deteriorated 
under increasing burdens. I will not repeat the requirements 
for new expansion. Our goal of rebuilding the basic utilities 
was not confined to providing for the enormous housing needs. 
We focused as much attention on strengthening the industrial 
sector capabilities and providing it with electricity, 
transportation, and a sewage system. I remember that in 1983, 
or perhaps late in 1982, I visited a factory. I asked the 
manager what they made. He said the factory produced 
refrigerators and washing machines. I noticed that the workers 
were sitting doing nothing. I asked why and if the factory was 
not operating. They told me that the power was out and that the 
factory had electric power for only two hours a day. I thought 
if it was reasonable for a factory that had the capability of 
producing 100 refrigerators a day to have electricity for only 
two hours and produce only 10 or 15 refrigerators. I thought 
the workers would be psychologically frustrated, because the 
more they produced the more they could get. The factory was 
losing and the workers were not to blame. Egypt at the time 
produced only 18 billion kilowatts, which was insufficient. 
Now, thank God, Egypt produces over 70 billion kilowatts. Had 
it not been for this increased energy production, we would not 
have had the new towns, industrial progress, or housing, etc. 
We focused this much attention on bolstering the industrial 
sector capabilities and providing the requirements of electric 
energy, transport, transportation, and sewage networks so that 
Egyptian or foreign investors can establish plants or projects 
that provide jobs to thousands of people who enter the work 
market every day. 
  In this respect, I think it is imperative that I mention 
two problems that have exhausted the Egyptian minds in the past 
decades in search of sound solutions. The first is the problem 
of population growth, which exceeds economic and social 
development rates. This may prove to be too difficult for our 
capabilities to handle in the near future. If we do not watch 
out for the population growth, a time will come when we will be 
like some countries that cannot feed their people. If the 
increase continues, where will we get the subsidies from? It 
will have to come through more taxes. We will not be able to 
build roads. We will not be able to create jobs, no matter what 
we do. In the near future, if we do not take this into 
consideration--and this takes years to pay off--Egypt will face 
dangers, maybe not in our lifetime, but during future 
generations, which we work for. The issue of population growth 
is very serious. We will not be able to find jobs, places, and 
a proper life for them. We will be like some countries, which I 
do not want to name, where people live in the mountain with 
questionable food supplies. Someone from one country told me 
that they have approximately 100 million people living below the 
poverty line. They do not even give them bread or anything. 
They leave them on their own to eat grass, and I do not mean 
the other grass [Egyptian Arabic word for grass is hashish] 
[audience laughs] or anything else. Naturally, this also 
results in the problem of unemployment. 
  The second problem is unemployment, which has been on the 
rise in recent years, although its roots and causes go back to 
earlier administrations during which real productivity was not 
the objective of employment. As far as the population growth is 
concerned, the efforts to which the entire people have 
contributed have made noticeable progress which, all signs 
indicate, will be sustained for long years to come. The 
increase in population cannot be stopped over night. It takes 
years for the rate to go down. The growth in population has 
gone down to approximately 2.2, which points to a sensible 
response by Egyptian families to the call for planning. Our 
Prophet has said: A strong believer is better and closer to God 
than a weak believer. If I have a modest income and a family of 
10, how can I feed them? Just having them around the house will 
raise your blood pressure and you will die. [audience laughs] 
Each one will ask for something. But if the family is small, 
no matter what headache they may cause you can handle it, you 
will be able to offer them a proper life, educate them, dress 
them well, and give them medical treatment. This is because we 
do not know what the future has in stock for us. I believe the 
future generations will not go through the labyrinths we, our 
fathers, and grandfathers had to go through. The world has 
shown an interest in the drop in the population growth in Egypt. 
Cairo has been chosen to host one of the most important 
conferences on population in the 20th century under the auspices 
of the United Nations. Thousands of political leaders, 
scientists, and thinkers will meet in Egypt to exchange ideas on 
population issues. 
  The Chinese, for instance, increase by 15 million every 
year. 
I laughed with them and told them: Why don't you take 30 
millions more from us and pretend that you increased by 30 
millions extra in two years. [audience laughs] We welcome this 
conference and the arrival of the elite world leaders, thinkers, 
and experts. But in the midst of this success, we must not 
forget that despite the drop in population growth in the past 
few years, the rate of population growth in Egypt is still 
higher than in many countries that strive to improve the living 
standards of their people. Despite this drop, we expect from 
now until the year 2000 to increase by 12 million people. Of 
them, more than 3.5 million youngsters will join the labor 
market. May God help us find jobs for them. We will have to 
find fruitful jobs for them, not to mention those who are left 
behind without a job as a result of the population increase in 
the past 10 years. 
  All this causes us to intensify government and popular 
efforts to sustain the success made in controlling the 
population increase, whether in hamlets, villages, or cities. 
As for the problem of unemployment, it exists all over the 
world, and I am not defending it. The United States is running 
around trying to open doors for workers. In France, which also 
suffers from a high unemployment rate, the French foreign 
minister has told the people: Don't expect me to solve this 
problem quickly, because it takes years. Here some people think 
it can be solved overnight. Someone comes out and calls for 
unemployment benefits. How can we tell who is working and who 
is unemployed? Maybe someone is working in the private sector 
and is applying for work in the government. Abroad, they have 
computers and know all the information. If someone submits an 
application, they will check his name on the computer. Is our 
system here computerized? No. And to computerize it we need 
money. 
  [Mubarak is asked by someone in the audience about Law No. 
55; he replies:] No, the government is still working on it 
because it is a very complicated issue. Do you want to quit or 
what? [audience laughs] 
  Perhaps the proper way to address the problem of 
unemployment 
is that for the first time we have a detailed chart that 
contains accurate information on the matter. The comprehensive 
survey conducted throughout all governorates and villages shows 
that the number of university and school graduates who have 
applied for work in the past 10 years is 3.946 million people, 
almost four million. We have found jobs for approximately 2.5 
million of them. Also, 835,000 more jobs have been found for 
applicants who do not hold university or school degrees. This 
shows that despite the difficulties, the Egyptian economy has 
managed to provide 3.4 million jobs in the past 10 years; that 
is, 341,000 [number as heard] jobs annually. But we cannot go 
on like this indefinitely. They need industries, land, etc. For 
how long can we keep up? However, the population increase has 
forced on us a situation where a number of graduates remain 
unemployed. They number approximately 2.4 million, and they 
represent 9.2 of the Egyptian work force. The unemployment rate 
is measured in comparison to the total work force, and this is 
the way it is everywhere in the world. I will read to you some 
figures about unemployment in the world, and they are statistics 
obtained from world magazines. In other words, we did not make 
them up to suit our purpose. In Spain the rate is 23 percent; 
in France it is 12 percent, and these are major industrial 
nations. In Italy it is 11.7 percent, in the UK it is 
approximately 10 percent, in Germany it is 9.1 percent, in the 
Netherlands it is 4.2 percent, in Belgium it is 11 percent, in 
Denmark it is 11 percent, in Finland it is 12.5 percent, and in 
Ireland it is 20 percent. This is just to show you the rates 
around the world. The rate in Egypt is 9.2 percent of the work 
force. 
  You are not unaware of the strenuous efforts undertaken by 
the state to cope with this steady increase in the number of 
citizens who join the work force annually. I repeat once again 
that the effective way to address this situation is to increase 
the growth rate in gross domestic product to be more than double 
the rate of population growth. This alone can absorb the new 
work force while at the same time lessen the number of the 
existing unemployed. We will not manage to expand productivity 
unless we are able to sell our products in the world markets. 
This is an important point. If production increases but it 
cannot be sold, nobody will increase the production. It will be 
wasted. Thus, we must find world markets. The world markets 
have their own conditions, and I believe that the private sector 
is more active than the business sector in this regard, and I 
hope the latter will catch up. In the meantime, the private 
sector must be more active, and we are helping it. We are 
opening doors abroad, and it has to do the rest. 
  A businessman with a large production once came to me and 
asked that the government market his products abroad. I told 
him that I would not pay him one fourth of the price of his 
products. [audience laughs] How could the government market 
his products? Let it market its own products, or not, right, 
'Atif [Sidqi]? [audience laughs] 
  We will not be able to expand the production bases until we 
are able to sell their products in world markets. This makes 
the expansion of exports a persistent requirement and a basic 
condition for progress. In addition, this is considered an 
essential requirement for bridging the present gap in the 
balance of payments and the trade balance. This gap is caused 
by the fact that we import $11 billion worth of commodities and 
our exports, excluding oil, total approximately $1.5 billion. 
  We do not doubt that Egypt's workers and producers will 
forge 
ahead to achieve this strategic goal so as to fulfill the 
homeland's hope for Egypt to take its fair share in 
international trade. The government will support every effort 
aimed at promoting exports and will remove all administrative 
obstacles before exporters. It remains for the producers and 
workers to make quality the focus of attention and activity. 
Let 1994, brothers and sisters, be the year of quality and the 
good name of Egyptian products, a year in which we will all 
participate to achieve great strides in our exports and to come 
close to a balance between imports and exports. Achieving this 
goal also requires us to go ahead with reforming the mismanaged 
companies now that we have drawn up a comprehensive program that 
we hope to able to implement in 1995 so that the workers of 
these companies will enjoy new circumstances allowing for 
increased production and higher wages. The workers in any 
successful establishment have a right to have higher wages that 
link wages and production. 
  The stance of the workers establishments on the reform 
program was splendid and proved that Egypt's workers are the 
soldiers of reform who have a real interest in promoting the 
production establishments and their capabilities. [applause] 
  Brothers and sisters, a serious and frank confrontation of 
shortcomings and the roots of problems and a firm commitment to 
the reform programs will win Egypt world respect and will give 
us increasing confidence in a brighter future. The concrete 
indications of this future are the fruits of reform that are 
manifest to everyone. We used to spend more than our annual 
income and would pay the accumulating and increasing deficit by 
borrowing inside and outside Egypt. However, we have 
rationalized our expenditure, developed our revenue sources, and 
have come very close to striking a balance between the state's 
revenues and expenditures. Certain circumstances dictated that 
we impose new taxes but we were careful that most of the burdens 
affect those who can afford to pay. However, it was inevitable 
that part of this burden would affect all segments of society in 
order to curb inflation, preserve the value of the national 
currency, and address the remaining defects that hindered the 
national economy. I am not an economist, but when inflation 
rises, prices will go up. Simply speaking, when inflation 
besets a country, there will be more money than production. 
Prices will skyrocket to the point that no one can control. 
  The economic reform policies, which economic experts and 
international establishments testify are being soundly 
implemented, have generated increased confidence in our national 
economy. The budget deficit dropped this year to less than 3 
percent, but at one time it had risen to about 25 percent. This 
is the main problem in many countries of the world. Inflation 
rates have dropped to 8 percent and the savings deposits have 
continued to increase. 
  Freeing the exchange rate and lifting restrictions on 
foreign currency have improved the investment atmosphere and 
reassured exporters. We have ended the black market. We also 
confronted those using the people's livelihood to acquire huge 
profits by exploiting the flow of subsidies. We faced the 
problem with courage. We devoted the entire subsidy to basic 
commodities for the toiling masses, namely bread, sugar, and 
edible oil. This enabled us to guarantee that this subsidy 
would go to the right people. However, there was much fraud. 
But I do not want to go into details. 
  We eliminated many restrictions that were imposed on 
investment. We reduced taxes on production equipment and tools. 
But some people say this is not enough. However, the issue 
still requires in-depth studies and new measures, because 42 
percent of the national industrial machinery is being imported 
from abroad. This is why the government will look into the 
production prerequisites so that we can compete. I must help 
the industrial sector, the private sector, and the business 
sector to enable them to compete in the world market. The 
current competition is extremely keen. The competition race 
will assume a new stage after the implementation of GATT. 
  We lifted the unjust burdens that obstructed producers. This 
will help them reduce production costs and enhance the ability 
of Egyptian products to compete in local and foreign markets. 
This will also help producers enter world markets and maintain 
a distinguished position for Egyptian exports. 
  Brothers and sisters, the sound starting point in the 
social, 
economic, and even political transformation process dictates 
that we marshal our greatest energies to create a radical change 
in the educational philosophy commensurate with development 
needs and society's requirements. I believe that we are 
pursuing a sound path. 
  The Egyptian citizen represents our most valuable treasure. 
The Egyptian citizen is our hope, and through this citizen 
alone the process of progress is completed and Egypt's aspired 
objectives are achieved. Progress cannot be achieved without 
the promotion of the Egyptian citizen's energies and the 
transfer of the largest number of this people into participants 
in increasing and promoting the quality of production. This is 
first among the many huge tasks that we still have to perform. 
The way to attain this task is to reconsider our concepts of 
the educational and training institutions, which are indeed 
productive establishments that should be given priority in our 
investment programs. 
  The developed world has realized that the potential and 
talent of a productive human being can be perceived and nurtured 
from the first year of education. The school is now a center 
for receiving education and the development of skills. Praise 
be to God, we realized that the importance of promoting the 
quality of education and its role in training and preparing 
skills will always enable the citizens to have the appropriate 
job opportunities. This could never have been done without an 
overall national program to modernize our schools and promote 
their syllabuses. We must focus on the substance and quality 
and not on quantity during the school years to enable our sons 
to carry out school activities that would develop their skills. 
  The implementation of this program started last year when, 
with the cooperation and effective and worthy participation of 
friends, the able sons of this country managed to insure the 
largest possible degree of investment to build thousands of 
modern schools that can serve this new concept and the 
objectives of education. Last year alone, 1,500 schools were 
built and 7,800 others were renovated. All this cost us 1.3 
billion pounds. This is where money is spent. Steps are under 
way to build 1,500 schools this year at a time when the 
investment expenditures were doubled over the past two years. 
The expenditures are four times those incurred in 1992. 
Nevertheless, there still are many things to be achieved because 
the program to modernize the Egyptian schools needs tens of 
billions of pounds. 
  It is worth noting that the plan to develop and modernize 
technical education and vocational training adopts the two-sided 
educational system applied in many advanced countries. This 
system is based on combining education and training in the 
institute because training is the basic factor in creating 
skilled labor, people who can deal with complicated technical 
problems and increase the quality of products. 
  Our new industrial facilities in Madinat al-'Ashir min 
Ramadan, Madinat Sittah Uktubar, al-Sadat, Burj al-'Arab, and 
other areas will pioneer this new educational trend. This 
should get us off to a good start in the 21st century, where 
factory blends with school, laboratory with library, and 
production and industry with science and innovation, and where 
quality is based on research and creativity. 
  The second task facing us is that of finding a comprehensive 
solution to the problems of Egyptian citizen living in 
randomly-built slum areas. The randomly-built areas are scars 
on Egypt's face. The level of public services available in 
these areas is much lower than anything we consider acceptable 
for a dear section of the Egyptian people. 
  As you may know, I have instructed the competent authorities 
to prepare a two-part comprehensive plan to face this problem. 
  The first part, already under way, deals with the problems 
of 
existing randomly-built areas, many of which go back to the 
thirties in this century. 
  When we looked closely into the randomly-built areas we 
discovered that some go back to the year 1924. The first 
shantytown sprang up in 1924. By the sixties the phenomenon had 
mushroomed and in the seventies and eighties it got even worse. 
  In al-Jizah, there is a place called 'Izbat al-Sa'aydah that 
goes back to 1924. Saqiyat Makki dates back to 1960 and 
al-Munib to 1970. In Cairo, 'Izbat Abu-Ard goes back to 1955, 
'Arab Ghunaym and 'Arab Wadi to 1960, Manshiyat Nasir to 1962, 
and 'Izbat al-Hajjanah to 1965. In Alexandria, 'Izbat al-Sayd 
goes back to 1960. All these are randomly-built areas that came 
into being over the years. 
  I would like to tell you this: When we began the first 
development plan we were not able to take care of every problem 
in the country. We had to make priorities. The money we had at 
our disposal was limited. We spend it according to priorities, 
updating the infrastructure, building housing, and so one and so 
forth. 
  Now, it is time to address the problem of randomly-built 
areas. Do you know how much these randomly-built areas will 
cost us? We have spent 581 million pounds so far. In order to 
rehabilitate these areas in 11 governorates, we will need seven 
billion pounds. Shall we cut back all other programs to focus 
on this problem? By the time we get to the other governorates, 
the sum total of expenditure on randomly-built areas will reach 
17 billion. We are aware of the size of the problem and, within 
our resources, will do everything possible to resolve it. I 
want every citizen to live in dignity. 
  In the first part of the aforesaid plan, we will spend 600 
million pounds in urban renovation programs, of which the 
southern governorates will receive about 300 million pounds. 
  The second part of the plan aims at preventing the emergence 
of such areas in the future through the building of planned 
areas in all governorates on a scale sufficient to absorb the 
increase in urban population. This effort will fall within the 
third development plan. 
  A third task facing us is that of protecting low-income 
households in order to achieve social justice. The country will 
continue to offer equal opportunity in education and to provide 
free education in all state-run schools. The state is also 
committed to providing health care to the needy in its hospitals 
and clinics. Over the next few years, we will redouble our 
effort to improve the quality of health care provided in 
state-run hospitals and clinics. 
  The state also takes it upon itself to subsidize bread, even 
if its cost goes up. We are now spending 1.542 billion on bread 
subsidies and will maintain these subsidies on principle, even 
though we are aware of the rising cost involved, due to 
increased wheat prices and the higher demand associated with the 
growth in population. The state is providing this subsidy 
because it believes that the poor should be able to buy bread at 
a price that suits their income. 
  The state's guarantee is confirmed and is continuing in all 
these fields. However, the real guarantee for those who are not 
able to help themselves is achieved by helping them become able 
to help themselves. Therefore, as of next year we will allocate 
more financial resources for the social fund, for the productive 
families project, and for the projects of supporting craftsmen 
and owners of small workshops to help these groups raise their 
income. 
  The fourth mission is the comprehensive and continuous 
modernization of the production of commodities and services. 
This is one of the most important challenges that we must meet 
as soon as possible. This will enable Egyptian producers to 
dedicate their efforts to developing Egyptian commodities in 
form and substance. 
  The fifth mission is the development of the Egyptian 
administration system so that it will be able to effect the 
desired changes aimed at increasing the Egyptian society's 
capacity for production and exports. We must search for 
qualified people and select those capable of turning loss into 
profit and failure into success in our establishments. We must 
train these personnel on the most modern methods of 
administration. This must take place under the supervision and 
auspices of efficient trainers capable of effecting this change 
in the Egyptian administration system. 
  Brothers and sisters, we are dedicating all our effort and 
work for the sake of God and the homeland. In all our steps we 
adhere to the basic interests of the people. We make sacrifices 
to make them happy and we work hard to make them secure. An 
examination of our activity abroad will reveal to those who wish 
to know that the main aim of this activity is to serve the 
domestic front, provide the proper climate for the promotion of 
the national interest, secure the Egyptian people's right to 
develop their resources, achieve the maximum employment of their 
creative capabilities, and arrive at a better life. 
  This was our pledge and commitment when we extended the 
bridges of friendship and understanding to the various peoples 
of the world, in the East and West and in the North and South. 
This was our wish and desire when we exploited these relations 
to find work opportunities for Egyptian workers abroad and to 
open new markets for Egyptian commodities and services. We 
succeeded in canceling half of our debts which accumulated while 
were building our infrastructure from a near zero point. This 
will remain our pledge and commitment as we step into the 21st 
century and participate with other states in establishing a new 
world order. 
  The emphasis of big and small states alike is generally 
turning from political and military affairs to economic issues 
and concerns. In this connection, we note two important 
phenomena that require us to open our minds and devote our 
thinking to the alternatives available to us to deal with them 
and with their effects on our national interests. The first 
phenomenon is represented by the rapid changes that have 
occurred recently in the field of international trade. Many 
people ask what this GATT is. I believe the economy minister 
can explain this issue on television. The recent round of 
Uruguay multilateral talks resulted in the signing of an 
important agreement which will result in drawing up the course 
of trade exchange among world states for the coming decades. 
This agreement was approved in Marrakesh on 15 April. The 
second phenomenon is the tendency of many states in the various 
continents to establish huge economic blocs that will make it 
difficult for small and isolated entities to run their economic 
and trade relations efficiently and effectively unless they take 
the necessary measures to deal with this new situation. 
  In view of the political and technical complications 
surrounding these two phenomena, we must not hesitate to assess 
them and to draft the policy we will follow in confronting their 
effect on us and the fraternal countries with whom we share 
unity of interest and fate, particularly the Arab fraternal 
countries and the African countries. Therefore, I decided to 
make these two topics an object of meticulous and in-depth study 
that does not focus on theoretical issues but on aspects that 
are useful in charting policy and adopting the stands that are 
effective in protecting our pan-Arab interests. 
  Since these two issues should be submitted to the various 
official and popular groupings and institutions for general 
discussion, I believe that the Labor Federation must effectively 
participate in this work [applause] because it would not be fair 
for such issues to be decided far from the concept and 
principles of the labor base. 
  Moving on to the Middle East peace process, we find that 
positive signs give rise to hopes that 1994 will be the year in 
which we find a comprehensive and lasting peace on every track, 
starting with the Palestinian track on which the two sides made 
great strides by signing the Oslo, Washington, and Cairo 
agreements and agreeing on most details for setting up the 
Palestinian self-rule authority to replace the Israeli military 
government and its civil administration. 
  The month of May must witness the faithful and strict 
implementation of these agreements so as to enhance the peace 
process and deepen the concerned peoples' confidence in the 
inevitability of the victory of peace and the influence of 
stability and security against the tendencies toward violence, 
rejection, and impotence. 
  Brothers and sisters, our high hopes for a brighter future 
are based on firm foundations and rational objective 
considerations. This is because they rely on clear-cut 
reasoning and hard work that has enabled Egypt regain its 
pioneering role in making progress. Had it not been for the 
corrective efforts along the economic and political tracks, we 
would have never been able to bridge the huge transformation 
process with the outstanding success that changed the face of 
life in Egypt. 
  Our clear concept promoted our conviction that the homeland 
will only achieve its objectives through the combined efforts of 
all its sons within a secure and stable society where rights and 
duties are equal. We have long experience which confirms that 
society will become more productive and capable if it allows its 
individuals to make initiatives, if it pursues wise policies, 
and if does not isolate itself from the process of world 
progress. 
  We also have a clear awareness that deepens our 
understanding 
of the importance of social solidarity in building a homeland 
free of hatred and rancor, guarded by social peace, unaffected 
by division and internecine fighting, and a homeland with 
safeguards for the interests of every citizen within a just 
system that will save the homeland's stability and harmony. 
  We have lessons learned from experience and the experience 
of 
others. These lessons confirm that a sound democracy can only 
be established by meeting the citizen's economic and social 
needs and demands. We are confident that a just peace 
represents a basic pan-Arab interest for the sake of stability 
and development. We have faced tremendous difficulties, but we 
made sincere efforts to build a firm foundation capable of 
standing fast in the face of emergency changes and capable of 
accomplishing continued development. 
  We have resisted the allure of palliative and temporary 
sedatives, opting instead to address the roots, not just the 
symptoms of problems. We sought out every expert who is willing 
to offer his opinion and effort. We opened the door wide to the 
experience of others, without complexes or sensitivities. We 
did everything humanly possible to stay on the right track, 
working out difficulties, correcting mistakes, and, within the 
limits of the law, deterring the ambitions of conspirators. 
  Our aim has always been that of bringing the country into 
the 
21st century and imparting to it enough vitality to deal with 
the challenges of a new era and to become a part of the march of 
human progress that accelerates daily with the contribution of 
all nations, old and new. 
  The world is moving faster and faster toward a future in 
which there will be no room for nations who are dependent on 
others or those too embroiled in their petty squabbles to read 
the writing on the wall. It is my belief that there is no 
country under the sun worthier than Egypt of becoming a part of 
the new dawn. [applause] 
  We do not need miracles; we have what it takes. Nor do we 
need to look far afield: We are at the threshold of 
achievement. The climate is right. The policies are in place. 
Change is already under way. 
  What every one of us should do now is search his soul, 
explore his duty, and get ready to play his part. What we need 
is faith in God and the country and a sense of responsibility 
toward the country's national interests. The nation is the sum 
total of all citizens. 
  We are not asking for miracles. We ask for solidarity, 
cooperation, and goodwill. These are the bastions that protect 
the country's unity and safety. We do not ask for great 
sacrifices. We encourage scrupulous performance, quality, and 
precision. We need to respect expertise, apply science, 
coordinate our efforts, and strive toward excellence and 
distinction. 
  We do not ask for the impossible. We ask for involved 
participation by every citizen everywhere. There is no longer a 
reason for indifference and apathy. Involved participation 
means that every one of us should undergo a change. We need to 
go back to our roots, to the principles that have brought 
civilization to the Egyptian people and the values that made 
them achieve miracles. 
  Brothers and sisters, truth is not the exclusive domain of 
anyone. Nor is responsibility the exclusive domain of the 
ruler, the party, or the government. Everyone has a part to 
play and is entitled to give his opinion and express his views. 
Everyone has national, ethical, and constitutional rights and 
obligations. 
  I am confident that we all have a sense of commitment to 
national interests and will act in a spirit of patriotism. This 
spirit is particularly felt in times of danger, when clouds of 
sedition gather in the air and the country walks toward a 
turning point of destiny. Regardless of our differences of 
opinion and disparity of views, unity and this spirit of 
patriotism will see us through. 
  Our spirit of patriotism and respect for national interests 
will help us preserve our unity. Our differences, regardless of 
their intensity, will remain within the realm of varying views 
and freedom of expression. Egyptian patriots reject destruction 
and loath any damage to the country's interests. 
  I am confident, brothers and sisters, that Egypt will 
emerge, 
God willing, stronger, more competent, and more determined to 
forge ahead on the path of progress. A new dawn is breaking and 
towering achievements are ahead. 
  Egypt will thrust forward, victorious and robust. Banners of 
glory will brighten the sky in every part of its land. Safe and 
stable, it will see construction grace every part of its land 
and its current and future generations step boldly into the 21st 
century. 
  Brothers and sisters, despite difficulties and troubles, I 
can say with a great deal of satisfaction and gratitude that God 
has guided us onto the right path. God has given us the 
strength to bear the burdens of our duties, the wisdom to make 
the right decisions, and the light to tell good from bad and 
right from wrong. 
  I implore God Almighty to give us the fortitude to stay on 
the right path and to act gracefully and honorably. "And say: 
Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your work, and His 
apostle, and the believers." [Koranic verse] May peace and 
God's mercy be upon you.

  [Text] Suhaj, 30 Apr (MENA)--Seven dangerous terrorists 
were killed today in Tahta in Suhaj Governorate. 
  The State Security Investigations Department has received 
information that the fugitive terrorists are hiding in a desert 
area west of Tahta. When the security forces tried to storm the 
terrorists' hideout, they were fired on. The security forces 
returned fire and killed the seven terrorists. A Grenof [as 
received] gun, one automatic rifle, and three Enfield rifles 
were found in their possession. 
  The seven killed terrorists are considered to be some of the 
most dangerous fugitives. They were involved in many terrorist 
incidents in southern Upper Egypt.

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman by </F>
Sana' al-Sa'id in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] It appears to many that the U.S. stands 
are inconsistent with peace and are inconsistent with what was 
agreed on at the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and 
al-Asad. Is Syria happy with the current U.S. stand? 
  [Salman] The peace process started following former 
President 
George Bush's March 1991 initiative, which regarded the 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as 
the basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. As one of the two cosponsors of the peace conference 
that was held toward the end of that year and of the subsequent 
Washington talks, the United States played a major role in 
preparing for the Madrid conference through the clarifications 
and guarantees it gave and its promises to play the role of an 
honest partner in the peace process. The U.S. Administration 
remained committed to the Bush initiative when President Clinton 
came to power. It has made many statements that it will 
continue its efforts to achieve peace on all tracks, especially 
after the Washington talks were halted when Israel struck out on 
its own with the PLO and concluded the Oslo agreement with it, 
completely ignoring the bases on which the Madrid conference was 
held. The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and 
Bill Clinton reiterated the Madrid conference's terms of 
reference and the U.S. commitment to continue its efforts for a 
comprehensive peace on all the tracks of the conflict. Thus, 
Washington is still intent on its commitment to the peace 
process, though the role it is now expected to play fails to 
live up to its pledge to play the role of a full and honest 
partner in the peace process. We believe that, in light of its 
special relations with Israel--which have reached the level of a 
strategic alliance--the U.S. Administration is capable of 
influencing the Israeli stand, which is impeding the U.S. 
initiative entailing the implementation of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and the exchange of land for peace. 
  [Al-Sa'id] In view of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's tour of the region, what is the United States 
specifically asked to do as a sponsor of the peace process and 
as an honest mediator? 
  [Salman] What is required is very clear, namely to fulfill 
its pledges and commitments to implement its initiative and 
effectively fulfill the role of a full and honest partner. This 
does not mean exerting pressure on Israel, as some circles are 
narrowly trying to interpret this issue, but rather to not leave 
international legitimacy's resolutions suspended in mid-air or 
subject to Israeli blackmail and bargaining. Israel uses these 
tactics in order to avoid the UN resolutions and replace them 
with new secret channels, on the Oslo model, so as to deal on 
its own with this or that Arab country and thereby conclude 
unilateral deals that thwart a just and comprehensive peace. 
  We hope that Christopher's visit will bring positive signs 
that the United States will act in conformity with its 
statements on activating the peace process and breaking the 
deadlock in the Washington talks, which was reached as a result 
of Israeli procrastination and intransigence. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The rounds of talks have so far proved that 
Israel is not serious about establishing peace and that it will 
continue its procrastination in order to keep the land as long 
as possible. How is it possible to eliminate the obstacles 
facing the peace process? 
  [Salman] This could be done if Israel acknowledges the 
inadmissibility of taking other people's land by force and 
accepts the land for peace principle. To do this, Israel must 
end its continuing occupation of the land and its rejection of 
Arab rights. Israel must also stop the its deceptive maneuvers 
on international level to disavow the requirements for peace. 
  The Arabs' steadfastness in the peace battle; the 
international community's awareness of the dangers inherent in 
the obstruction of the peace process; the unbiased and full 
partnership in the peace conference's sponsors, particularly the 
United States; and the new reality imposed by the intifadah on 
the Israeli occupiers that geographical factors cannot assure 
security--it goes without saying that these are all factors in 
forcing Israel to abandon its policy that is hostile to peace 
and the international legitimacy and for placing the 
comprehensive peace process on the right path. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Israel is convinced that the United States will 
not pressure it over talks with Syria due to Israel's internal 
situation and their coalition status. Can you comment? 
  [Salman] This issue concerns U.S.-Israeli relations and the 
U.S. desire to maintain the credibility of its commitment to 
achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. We know well 
the strength of the U.S.-Israeli alliance. But this does not 
necessarily mean that the United States is unable to pursue a 
policy that serves its special interests or to entertain a peace 
plan that is not in line with Israel's, particularly since the 
United States is talking about a new world order based on the UN 
Charter and resolutions. We should note with guarded optimism 
how former President Eisenhower forced Israel to withdraw from 
Sinai following the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you expect a full or partial Israeli 
withdrawal 
from the Golan? 
  [Salman] The withdrawal from the Golan must be complete. We 
hope that Rabin's remarks on withdrawal from the Golan are free 
of any ambiguity, such as we have been confronting at every 
session of talks on the principle of complete withdrawal from 
the occupied territories in return for peace. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Israel claims that Syria is hedging its bets. 
On the one hand, it keeps peace exchanges going with Israel, 
while on the other, it uses Hizballah as a bargaining chip. How 
do you see this? 
  [Salman] Our policy is not influenced by Israeli 
interpretations. The moment we endorsed the U.S. initiative we 
made it clear that peace is a strategic goal for Syria and the 
Arab world. To achieve this goal, we should employ our 
resources in the battle for peace. Therefore, we should adhere 
to our pan-Arab principles and support acts of legitimate 
resistance. The UN Charter endorses the right of nations to 
resist occupation. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The Gaza-Jericho agreement led to a halt in 
negotiations on other tracks and to a discontinuation of the 
peace process. What can you say about that? 
  [Salman] That agreement was an attempt to deprive the peace 
process of its foundation, namely, the two UN Security Council 
resolutions [242 and 338]. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted as much when 
he said: "The Oslo agreement proved the futility of the 
Washington talks." Rabin urged secret talks as a way of 
reaching separate agreements with other Arab parties to the 
peace process. By doing so, Israel hopes to renege on all 
commitment to the UN Security Council resolutions. 
  But Rabin failed to achieve this, despite Israel's 
intentional obstruction of the Washington talks, which stumbled 
as a result. The Geneva summit ended the premature elation that 
accompanied the signing of the Oslo agreement. That summit 
confirmed that a comprehensive solution must be found on all the 
negotiating tracks. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Arab world splits are a nightmare that weakens 
the 
Arab negotiating position vis-a-vis Israel. 
  [Salman] Since the corrective movement [al-Asad's rise to 
power] in 1970, Syria has endeavored to cement Arab solidarity. 
President Hafiz al-Asad has said that: "The strength of the 
Arabs is in their unity." President al-Asad warned us not to 
worrying about secondary issues and forget crucial Arab matters. 
  There are cracks in the Arab armor, but these can be sealed. 
We will do everything within our power to restore Arab 
solidarity. Those who fail to learn the lessons of the recent 
past have much to lose, and we are afraid the loss will be 
bigger this time. 
  As for those who remain firm and faithful in word and deed 
to 
the will of the nation, they discern through the clouds of 
discord the need for strict adherence to pan-Arab principles and 
further commitment to the interests of future generations.

  [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and his delegation yesterday evening. 
The delegation includes Dennis Ross, special Middle East peace 
process coordinator; Christopher Ross, U.S. ambassador in 
Damascus; and Martin Indyk, special assistant to the U.S. 
president for Middle East affairs. The meeting was attended by 
Faruq al-Shar', minister of foreign affairs; Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, 
head of the Syrian delegation to the peace talks; and Walid 
al-Mu'allim, Syria's ambassador in Washington. 
  Talks dealt with the peace process and all aspects of the 
ideas presented during Saturday's meeting. The president 
explained Syria's viewpoint, which stems from a real desire for 
a just and comprehensive peace that guarantees the rights of all 
parties. He stressed that addressing the basic peace issues is 
what can guarantee the progress of this process. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his 
delegation 
left Damascus last night following a two-day visit to the Syrian 
Arab Republic. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', senior Foreign 
Ministry officials, the Syrian ambassador in Washington, and the 
American ambassador in Damascus saw him off at Damascus 
International airport. 
  Speaking to reporters prior to his departure, Mr. 
Christopher 
described his talks with President Hafiz al-Asad as extremely 
serious and substantial. He said that, in his opinion, there is 
much to do and substantive talks to be held. A great deal of 
work and effort are awaiting us in the future, he said. 
  Mr. Christopher said he relayed some ideas to Damascus and 
took others from it. He told reporters he was going to Israel 
to meet with Yitzhaq Rabin and then on to Cairo. He said that 
at present he has no plans to return to Damascus and added that 
his country will play a more effective role to help the parties. 
He said he discussed the subject of bilateral relations with 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and that he will resume talks 
with him if Mr. al- Shar' visits Washington. 
  Replying to a reporter's question, Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' said Syria does not accept phased peace with Israel and 
insists on complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories as a condition for the establishment of peace in the 
region. He added that there has been no change whatsoever in 
the Syrian position on the peace process. Al-Shar' said 
President Hafiz al-Asad asked several substantive questions 
which the Israeli side has to answer. Asked about the idea of 
Majdal Shams first, the foreign minister said Syria's position 
is that the Golan should be restored in full.

  [Text] In addition to extending condolences on the death of 
Her Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf, the Jordanian queen mother, 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to Jordan on Thursday [28 
April] was a political opportunity to exchange views with Jordan 
on developments in the Arab situation and Jordanian-Syrian 
coordination on the political settlement. This is especially 
true in view of the fact that the visit coincided with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's regional tour and the 
announcement by Israel and the PLO that they have reached an 
agreement on the implementation of the Oslo agreement on 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, and that the agreement will be 
signed on Wednesday under U.S.-Egyptian sponsorship. 
  During their meeting, King Husayn and President al-Asad 
stressed adherence to a comprehensive and final solution. They 
emphasized that Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination will 
continue and that any new separate deals that would weaken other 
positions will be avoided. 
  Jordan explained that it rejected and continues to reject 
U.S. proposals on the formation of a four-way 
Egyptian-Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian committee whose task 
would be to help implement the self-rule agreement. 
  Jordan proposed that a six-way committee be set up within 
the 
framework of the Washington negotiations to discuss appropriate 
ways to link the Palestinian self-rule agreement to other tracks 
of bilateral negotiations. 
  For this six-way committee, which would be comprised of 
representatives from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the 
Palestinians, and Israel, to advance the peace negotiations on 
all tracks, including the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, Jordan 
believes that U.S. and Russian participation will be useful and 
will help bring views closer. However, the United States, 
Israel, and Egypt believe that any formula of this kind means a 
return to an international peace conference. The three parties 
believe that a solution can only be reached within a bilateral 
framework following the example of the Camp David and Oslo 
agreements. Moreover, Christopher told King Husayn that Arab 
coordination prevents parties from moving toward separate 
settlements, for bilateral negotiations are held in isolation 
from other parties and it would be faster to reach bilateral 
solutions. 
  In their meeting, which was held during a working luncheon, 
the Jordanian monarch and the Syrian president agreed that a 
meeting of the foreign ministers of the Arab parties to the 
negotiations will be held in Amman soon after the conclusion of 
the U.S. secretary of state's tour. The aim of the meeting will 
be to assess the results of this tour and to adopt a unified 
stand on the resumption of the bilateral negotiations, which are 
supposed to resume in Washington in mid-May. 
  According to both sides' assessment, the Jordanian-Syrian 
meeting was successful. It was agreed to intensify contacts to 
emphasize coordination.

  [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has announced his 
ministry has decided to reconsider all measures pertaining to 
the arrival of West Bankers and Gazans in the country. He said 
all Interior Ministry organizations will apply new measures in 
this regard as of the day after tomorrow, Sunday [1 May]. 
  Hammad made these remarks during a tour of the al-Husayn 
Bridge this morning. During his tour, he inspected the 
reception halls for arrivals and departures. He also listened 
to the requests of arrivals from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  Hammad added: Pursuant to the instructions of His Majesty 
King Husayn, and in light of the inspirational and culturally 
significant statements made by His Highness Crown Prince Hasan 
last week on the need to reconsider the regulations issued by 
the Interior Ministry with regard to the residence of West 
Bankers and Gazans in Jordan, the Interior Ministry has decided 
to thoroughly reconsider all measures and regulations issued by 
the Interior Ministry in this regard. The new measures will 
facilitate things for arrivals. 
  The interior minister said all the measures enforced thus 
far 
were intended to firmly promote the steadfastness of the 
kinsfolk in the occupied territories, safeguard Jordan's 
national security, and thwart the implementation of displacement 
schemes the Israeli occupation troops sought to carry out. 
  Hammad went on to say: The Interior Ministry has enforced 
the old regulations pertaining to the residence and transit of 
West Bankers and Gazans within the context of Jordan's firm 
pan-Arab outlook vis-a-vis the kinsfolk and brothers. Jordan, 
which was careful to keep the bridges with the occupied 
territories open since 1967, has contributed to maintaining 
pan-Arab cohesion and deepening the pan-Arab sentiments of the 
kinsfolk, who are holding out in the occupied Palestinian Arab 
territories, although this policy was the object of criticism by 
some parties in the past. 
  Hammad said: Jordan, which is proud of its Hashemite 
leadership, has striven to promote the spirit of Arab 
renaissance and sought to make Jordan an exemplary homeland that 
embraces pan-Arab sentiments, and that inspires others with its 
ideas, instead of exporting them, as His Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan has noted. 
  Jordan's historical ties with the kinsfolk in our occupied 
homeland have always required the best formula and best way to 
mitigate the agonies brought about by the occupation. 
  Hammad added: Given the fact that the reasons that prompted 
the Interior Ministry to issue its old regulations are about to 
become a thing of the past, and since the Palestinian brothers 
are about to realize their aspirations, the Interior Ministry, 
in implementation of directives issued by His Majesty King 
Husayn, will revoke these regulations. Besides, it will strive 
to reconsider the regulations governing the renewal of the 
passports carried by West Bankers and Gazans. It will also 
introduce the system of cards [not further identified]. This 
will allow for the movement of students across the bridges to 
further their education. The ministry will later announce 
additional measures in this regard. The Interior Ministry will 
thoroughly examine the usefulness of using cards. The new 
regulations will take effect as of the day after tomorrow, 
Sunday. 
  Salamah Hammad began his tour this morning by chairing a 
meeting at the Bridges Administration Office. The meeting was 
attended by the officials concerned. The interior minister 
informed them of the new regulations. He was also briefed on 
the measures the Bridges Administration Office will enforce this 
summer. 
  During the meeting, Colonel 'Abd-al-Salam al-Ja'afirah, 
director of the Bridge Security Centers, said the bridges will 
remain open for 18 hours every day, and that there will be a 
chance to make reservations ahead of the actual crossing time, 
to ease the burdens placed on citizens. He said the number of 
reservation offices in all the governorates will be increased. 
  The minister of interior also inspected the new reception 
hall, which has room for 600 passengers. He also met with 
departures and listened to their remarks. He received several 
arrivals, including a delegation of Gazans that came to offer 
condolences on the death of the late Queen Zayn al-Sharaf.

husbands. 
  8. The BSDD will allow the arrivals to stay for the duration 
of time they wish on condition that the permit issued by the

  9. In all cases, all persons who carry family reunion 
permits issued by the occupation authorities should keep these

  10. These instructions will take effect as of 1 May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Minister of Finance Sami Qammuh on Saturday 
[30 April] credited the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
with enhancing the symbolism of Palestinian authority through 
the signing of the PLO-Israeli economic agreement without 
negating the economic accord that the Palestinians signed with 
Jordan in January. 
  Mr. Qammuh, in an interview with the JORDAN TIMES , said the 
government's initial reading of the Paris agreement "shows that 
the PLO has gained more than anticipated...it is a step 
achieved." 
  The documents, of which only excerpts were made available to 
the press, is reportedly 15 pages long and deal with the 
different aspects of the Palestinian economy in detail. 
  "There are new areas and new grounds for Palestinian 
authority in the agreement," Mr. Qammuh said in reference to the 
accord, which was signed by Israeli Finance Minister Avraham 
Shohat and PLO negotiator Ahmad Quray' in a ceremony attended by 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe at his ministry's 
headquarters in Paris. 
  Mr. Qammuh pointed especially to the Palestinians gaining 
independent economic decisions over taxation, banks and 
currency, stamps and customs. 
  He said the economic pact does not negate an economic 
agreement between Jordan and the PLO which was signed here in 
January. "The PLO-Israeli agreement is not in contradiction 
with the Jordan-PLO agreement," he said. 
  He said Jordan views positively any improvement which 
promotes the independent economic decision of the Palestinians. 
  But the minister's positive reaction was not shared by 
economists and other officials who said that the agreement 
amounted to the PLO sanctioning the holding of the Palestinian 
economy "hostage to the Israeli economy." 
  The points which were positively received by Mr. Qammuh 
appeared to be the same as those that the critics picked up on 
to indicate a new Palestinian tilt away from Jordan and towards 
Israel. 
  Critics of the agreement said its different articles were 
geared to the benefit of the Israeli economy creating an 
"economic integration between the Palestinian entity and Israel" 
and treating Jordan like any other Arab country dealing with the 
new Palestinian entity. 
  Conceding that the agreement holds symbols of authority for 
the emerging Palestinian entity, the critics maintain that while 
the Israelis "are spend thrift with symbolism, they are stingy 
when it comes to the actual implementation." 
  "There is not a single positive element in this agreement," 
one economist contended. 
  The agreement, he argued, has singled out the Israeli shekel 
as the legal tender in the areas under Palestinian authority and 
"has dumped the Jordanian dinar with other currencies." 
  According to the agreement, pending final arrangements, the 
Israeli shekel "will continue to constitute a legal means for 
payment in the autonomy's areas side by side with other 
currencies." 
  Banks which were initially expected to come under the 
authority of the Central Bank of Jordan "are now going to be run 
by the Palestinian monetary authority which is still under an 
Israeli authority," the economist said. 
  Where Jordan hoped to have an advantage, trade between the 
East and West Bank, Israel and the PLO had agreed to free 
movement of goods at what appears to be the same prices as those 
offered in Israel while placing Jordan in a situation where its 
exports to the territories will be taxed. 
  "Jordan will be dealt with as if it is exporting to Israel," 
another economist said. 
  A senior official defending the agreement said that the 
critics were looking at the agreement only from one angle and 
forgetting that this agreement is between Israel and the PLO and 
that that is "only one front" of the over all picture. 
  "It is not a zero sum theory," said the official, who asked 
for anonymity. "Any improvement on the living and work 
conditions of Palestinians is good for us," the official said. 
  He said that the opening up of trade between Jordan and the 
Palestinian entity, at any level, is an improvement on the 
current situation where "there is almost no trade." 
  He said that the agreement provides for a favoured trade 
status for Jordan and Egypt ahead of other Islamic and Arab 
countries. 
  "What is happening is that a new market is opening up across 
the border," the official said. "Instead of being fearful and 
criticising the situation from afar we should be ready to take 
advantage of the situation." 
  "There can be no progress or success when we are crippled by 
fear," the senior official said. 
  Under the Jordan-PLO agreement, the senior official said, it 
was expected that the Jordanian dinar was not going to be the 
main currency in the occupied territories and that the Central 
Bank of Jordan was only going to supervise the banks "until the 
time the Palestinians were able to establish their own monetary 
authority." 
  "The agreement never said that Jordan will take over the 
monetary affairs of the Palestinian entity... It is still going 
to take some time before the Palestinans establish a monetary 
authority and the Jordan-PLO agreement stands until that time," 
he added. 
  Critics, the official said, have to understand that "we in 
Jordan want them (the PLO) to have authority and to supervise 
their own affairs."

  [Text] Jordan will send an observer to a round of 
multilateral talks on Middle East disarmament scheduled to be 
held in Doha, Qatar, this week. Diplomatic sources said Jordan 
will continue to send low-key participants to the multilateral 
talks until action was taken on the siege of al-'Aqabah. 
  This is the second time that Jordan will be staying away 
from 
active participation in the Middle East multilateral talks since 
it announced that rejoining the talks hinged upon an end to 
interceptions by Western warships of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels. 
  The naval inspections, which are part of the enforcement of 
sanctions against Iraq, have cost the Kingdom $1.3 billion in 
extra freight and delays caused by diversions of ships from the 
port of al-'Aqabah.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agreement To Solve Problem of </F>
Jordanian al-'Aqabah Blockade"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Jordanian 
Foreign Ministry yesterday announced that the proposal currently 
raised to solve the problem of the blockade imposed on 
al-'Aqabah port, which -- so it seems -- enjoys the Americans' 
approval, is actually a Jordanian proposal. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Ahmad Mubayyidin, 
spokesman for the ministry, said that the proposal says that an 
international company -- namely the British company Lloyd's 
Register, which is not a commercial company -- would inspect the 
ships and cargo in port, not at sea as is happening now. He 
denied that there is a specific date for implementing this 
proposal. He added: Of course, legally, the blockade does not 
concern the United States in particular, as it falls under the 
powers of the UN Security Council sanctions committee. Thus 
consultations must be held within the framework of this 
committee in order to take a decision to begin implementing the 
proposal, which stipulates that al-'Aqabah-bound ships should 
not be subjected to obstacles or search measures by U.S. Navy 
units or any other units, and that these ships should arrive in 
the port very easily. Cargo should be examined inside the port 
by the international company's representative in cooperation 
with a competent Jordanian committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace Cannot Come In Pieces"] </F>
  [Text] The constant, principled position reiterated by 
Damascus yesterday, prior to the talks between U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and President Hafiz al-Asad, has given 
the peace process a comprehensive pan-Arab dimension, set it on 
the right track, and revealed Israel's false allegations and 
gimmicks to circumvent the foundations and concepts of the just 
and comprehensive peace aspired to by the Arab parties. 
  The Syrian rejection of partial and separate settlements and 
secret negotiations and deals emphasizes the fact that peace is 
an indivisible whole and cannot be achieved in bits and pieces 
by dividing withdrawal and scheduling stages. The 
land-for-peace principle cannot, under any other name, stipulate 
giving back part of the territory in exchange for peace; full 
peace entails full withdrawal, giving each party its rights, and 
uprooting the causes of tension and conflict. 
  The Israeli concept, which takes after the shylock model of 
barter, wants to give back the occupied Arab territories in 
pieces. In return, it wants to exact the full price of peace all 
at once. Such exposed maneuvers and names such as "Majdal-Shams 
First," like Gaza-Jericho First, will not deceive the other Arab 
fronts, which do not accept half solutions and only seek 
comprehensive and just peace in return for withdrawal from the 
occupied territories -- all of the occupied territories -- 
without any division, bargaining, or flexibility. 
  The Oslo accord was concluded under special circumstances 
and 
considerations that have to do with the reality and 
considerations of the Palestine question and the Palestinian 
people under occupation. It was also the outcome of political 
circumstances and the suffering of a people under an unjust 
military rule. This accord, however, does not constitute a 
formula that can be promoted on the other Arab fronts. 
  Just as Israel withdrew fully from Sinai under the peace 
agreement with Egypt, the solution of the Syrian, Jordanian, and 
Lebanese tracks cannot depart from this framework in all its 
political details and facts. 
  The three Arab parties are determined to reject half 
solutions and peace in pieces in adherence with the 
land-for-peace principle. They believe that peace does not stand 
a chance of survival if it is not a comprehensive peace in 
return for a comprehensive withdrawal from all the Arab 
territories, without exception. 
  Such a comprehensive Arab strategy, stressed by His Majesty 
King Husayn and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Amman a few 
days ago, constitutes a basis for the Arab negotiator in his 
quest for a just and comprehensive peace. 
  Therefore, the U.S. role in advancing the peace process 
should not be limited to conveying and propagating Israeli 
ideas; it should correct the course of these ideas and reject 
any attempt to circumvent the land-for-peace principle and the 
Madrid framework, which is based on UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338. The U.S. initiative that launched the 
peace process almost three years ago was originally based on 
these principles.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. </F>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher with foreign and domestic 
correspondents in Jerusalem on 29 April "after the second 
meeting between the two" -- live; broadcast in progress] 
  [Excerpts] [Rabin, in English] ...the negotiations for 
peace between us and the Palestinians, between us and that three 
neighboring Arab countries. We appreciate the efforts that you 
have put since you became a secretary of state in bringing about 
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. You spent some days now 
in Cairo with President Mubarak, Chairman 'Arafat, our Foreign 
Minister Peres, and helped to bring about the beginning of the 
end of the negotiations about Gaza-Jericho First. I know that a 
date was set for the signing of the agreement, but there are 
still some issues to be negotiated, formulated, and be put in 
the draft -- not the draft, in the context of the agreement on 
which we will sign. 
  I know that now you will go to other Arab countries, 
especially to Syria, in an effort to revive the peace 
negotiations between Israel and Syria. Israel is interested in 
achieving peace treaties with the three neighboring Arab 
countries, beyond the peace with Egypt. And we appreciate your 
efforts in bringing the Syrian and the Israeli positions closer, 
and I wish you all the success on your road to Damascus. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent in 
English 
regarding reports on a deal to offer Syria control over Golan 
Druze villages] 
  [Rabin, in English] I do not believe that it will be 
advisable to me, before the secretary will go to Damascus, to 
discuss any details of what we brought before the secretary as 
our basic approach for the peace with Syria. [passage omitted] 
  [Qol Yisra'el political correspondent Shlomo Raz] I 
understand that the meeting with Secretary Christopher focused 
on the Syrian issue. Were the Americans given any additional 
information that will facilitate expediting the negotiations 
with Syria? Has Israel presented more detailed plans or the 
scope of the withdrawal it is willing to carry out on the Golan 
Heights? 
  [Rabin] Today, our main goal is to complete the work in 
Cairo in order to attain an agreed formulation of the 
Gaza-Jericho First accord. Such an agreement has not yet been 
fully drafted. Several problems which require examination and 
agreement still exist. The delegation headed by the deputy 
chief of staff will leave for Cairo on the morning of 1 May in 
the hope of wrapping everything up by the evening of 2 May. 
Several issues were left for a meeting I will hold with 'Arafat 
on 3 May. Those issues must be concluded in order to attain a 
complete and total agreement. A date was set, but there still 
are issues that need to be completed, agreed upon, and added to 
the formulation of the agreement. 
  In fact, today we dealt with issues that concern the 
negotiations with the other Arab partners -- that is, the three 
neighboring Arab countries. Naturally, we dealt primarily with 
Syria. We also heard the secretary's briefing on the outcome of 
his meeting with King Husayn in London in the context of the 
resumption of the negotiations with Jordan. We presented the 
secretary with our stands in principle regarding our willingness 
and conditions for the attainment of peace with Syria. Do not 
expect me to give details, but the main principles of our stands 
are known, and I will not repeat them on this occasion. I 
believe that, in the absence of direct contacts, negotiations 
should be held through the secretary of state. He will relay 
our stands, and I will not do this through the media. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent] 
  [Rabin] I presented a comprehensive concept which contains 
the nature of peace, the principle of withdrawal with which you 
are familiar from my previous declarations, the stages, 
reference to the implementation of each step, as well as several 
demands from the United States. I will provide no further 
details. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Among the issues raised in the discussions U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher held in Israel was the 
option that the agreement with Syria be implemented in stages, 
spread over five to eight years. This was reported by our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz. Jerusalem believes that if 
al-Asad is made aware of the nature of the permanent agreement 
between the two countries at an early stage, he will be willing 
to accept the stages of the interim agreement Israel is offering. 
  Yesterday, the offer raised at the time by James Baker -- 
that U.S. forces be stationed on the Golan Heights -- was also 
discussed. The parties further discussed the economic aid Israel 
would receive from the United States if an agreement is signed 
with Syria. 
  Senior political sources further told our correspondent that 
in Damascus, Christopher will discuss bilateral Syrian-U.S. 
issues such as removing Syria from the list of terror sponsoring 
countries, Syria's status in Lebanon, and its involvement in the 
international drug trade. Syria will also be asked to lift its 
boycott on the multilateral talks.

  [Excerpts] In a meeting held in the prime minister's 
bureau this afternoon, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
presented a detailed Syrian answer regarding the continuation of 
the negotiations. Syria insists that the withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights be complete, but it is willing to recognize 
Israel's security needs and to discuss normalization. This is 
reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 2 May carries a 
report by Sefi Hendler on the meeting between Christopher and 
Rabin, adding that "according to what we learned from political 
sources in Jerusalem, progress was indeed achieved in talks with 
Syria. Even if it is not exceptional, this is unprecedented 
progress on the Syrian track. This is the first time since the 
beginning of the negotiations with Syria that the Syrians have 
not rejected Israel's proposals out of hand. In their meeting, 
Christopher presented to Rabin Syria's answers to the security 
issues relating to the withdrawal. This is the first time that 
Syria has addressed Israel's security needs. The Syrian 
response is currently being examined."] 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said we are at the first stages 
of our negotiations with Syria, therefore he cannot say whether 
he is optimistic or pessimistic. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir 
reports Mr. Rabin told the Labor Knesset faction Israel has not 
used Christopher's service for relaying to Syria a withdrawal 
map or the final withdrawal lines. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin said he was furious over the fact that a 
regular army battalion is forced to guard 415 Jews in Hebron 
instead of fighting terrorism. Mr. Rabin said the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] is being stretched to the limit in guarding the 
settlements and the Green Line instead of fighting terrorism. 
Rabin said that it is not Elon More [West Bank settlement] 
which is guarding Hadera and 'Afula, but rather the IDF. It is 
not the number of settlements on the Golan Heights which defend 
the Golan, but rather the number of tanks deployed there.

  [Text] Two opposition leaders, the Likud's Binyamin 
Netanyahu and Refa'el Eytan of Tzomet, accused the prime 
minister of lying about the Golan Heights. Netanyahu told a Tel 
Aviv news conference that a year ago he presented a map in the 
Knesset showing the stages of withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
and Rabin denied the remarks. Today, Netanyahu said, I have 
proof that it is precisely the map Christopher is presenting 
President al-Asad in Syria. 
  Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that 
Refa'el Eytan submitted a paper offered to him as a basis for 
negotiations on his joining the coalition three months ago. He 
said the paper claims that no settlement would be uprooted, the 
Golan settlements would be strengthened, and all the completed 
apartments would be inhabited. These points were also shown to 
be false, Eytan said. 
  The prime minister's bureau said in response that there has 
not been any change in Israel's position on peace with Syria 
since the establishment of the government, and the commitment to 
hold a national referendum prior to any signing of a peace 
agreement with Syria that involves territorial concessions 
remains intact .

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent Shlomo Ganor in the studio on 29 April -- 
recorded, in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the 
Hebrew] 
  [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Foreign Minister, you met with the 
U.S. secretary of state today. What did Israel equip him with 
in anticipation of his meetings in Damascus tomorrow? 
  [Peres] He was given significant equipment in terms of ideas 
regarding the two issues on the agenda: the method of 
negotiations and their content. It is clear to me that it is 
impossible to reach agreement on the content before we determine 
the manner in which the negotiations will be held. In other 
words, no agreement can be reached without holding meetings at 
the level of the decisionmaking leadership on one hand and 
exchanging ideas at a discreet level on the other. In order to 
conduct proper negotiations, we need a quiet place in which 
ideas can be exchanged and a public place where the people can 
see that both sides seriously intend to attain peace. 
  [Ganor] And so far, Syria has not understood this message? 
  [Peres] No. So far, Damascus has been stubborn in its own 
way. We are not telling Damascus that it should align itself 
with the Israeli way of negotiating. We are telling Syria that 
Damascus, like Jerusalem, should conduct negotiations according 
to acceptable international norms. 
  [Ganor] Is Israel insisting that the nature of peace be 
defined before it determines the depth of withdrawal on the 
Golan? 
  [Peres] It is very possible that negotiations on both these 
issues should be held in parallel. If I tell you that one 
should come before the other, then one party would ask why it 
should be the first, and so on. We are saying to Damascus: At 
this time, let us determine a method that will enable us to 
discuss ideas and a method that will enable us to demonstrate to 
the people that we are heading toward peace. 
  [Ganor] In the meantime, there is a feeling in the Golan 
settlements that an Israeli-Syrian arrangement will begin with 
Majdal Shams first. 
  [Peres] There is no basis to this story. We have entered no 
territorial or detailed negotiations. At this stage, we are 
negotiating only about the manner in which we should begin real 
and serious negotiations. 
  [Ganor] Did the United States show understanding regarding 
the package of guarantees Israel is seeking? 
  [Peres] There is no doubt the Americans showed an interest 
in the package. I would not want to commit them to more than 
that. I believe Mr. Christopher's jet was given enough fuel to 
travel to Damascus. 
  [Ganor] What are the chances of resuming the Washington 
negotiations now that the Palestinian issue has been settled, at 
least in part? 
  [Peres] I believe there is more chance of this now because 
Israel has once again proven that it is seriously and honestly 
interested in reaching an understanding and an arrangement with 
the Arabs. After all, no one pressured us in the negotiations 
with the Palestinians; there were no thundering guns or pressure 
from the superpowers. The decision to reach an arrangement came 
from within. Incidentally, this is happening around the world. 
South Africa solved its problems from the inside. Communism 
was eliminated from within. There is no one out there to apply 
pressure. Each nation should decide for itself where it wants 
to go, the price it is willing to pay for this, and the stages 
it wants to go through in order to solve its problems. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what reality will prevail in Gaza and in 
Israel starting 4 May? 
  [Peres] It will be different from anything we have known 
over the past 46 years. We left Gaza once, but we were replaced 
by the Egyptians. This is the first time we will leave most of 
the Gaza Strip and be replaced by Gaza residents exercising 
self-rule, self-management, and their own responsibility. Look, 
the Palestinian nation has never known the taste of being a 
nation. It has never had a territorial address. This is the 
first time the Palestinians will have a piece of reality with a 
territorial address and the authority of an interim government, 
of self-rule. This is a great thing for them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich by Ze'ev Kohen </F>
at the Tel Aviv studio on 30 April -- live] 
  [Text] [Kohen] Christopher is conferring today, perhaps 
right now, with President al-Asad with the package from Israel 
under his arm. Does that package contain anything that can 
bring about a breakthrough in the stalemate? 
  [Rabinovich] We think so. The term package can arouse the 
wrong associations because it has a physical connotation. We 
should talk about a series of issues and positions which 
together constitute a whole. In our view, the parcel is such 
that if the Syrians respond to it as a whole and to its 
components adequately, there can be a breakthrough in the 
negotiations. 
  [Kohen] In reference to the physics of the package, as you 
referred to it, what does it contain: maps and lines or just 
principles? 
  [Rabinovich] The Americans are not carrying any map with 
delineated lines. Some of the things uttered are broad 
speculations. They went with ideas and impressions, and I think 
that these ideas are sufficient for a very interesting 
conversation to be conducted with President al-Asad in Damascus. 
  [Kohen] To the best of your knowledge, did Rabin's public 
pronouncement about his readiness to evacuate settlements have 
an impact in Damascus? 
  [Rabinovich] I think it must have strengthened among the 
Syrians the feeling that should have been aroused there a long 
time ago, that we are a serious partner, that we are interested 
in a settlement, that we give it serious thought, that we are 
prepared to pay a reasonable price for a good agreement. The 
other side, however, is very tough and does not always 
understand us fully. It he does not understand how an open, 
democratic, parliamentary system like ours operates. The fact 
that the direct contacts with the other side is very, very 
limited makes mutual revelation and understanding difficult. 
Therefore, the intensity of some of our moves, proposals, 
gestures, are not always sufficiently understood by the other 
side. 
  [Kohen] Sir, we disclosed a formula under the headline 
"Majdal Shams First." What can you tell us about it? Is that 
the bridge that will permit us to cross the river? 
  [Rabinovich] I said before that many of the speculations 
being heard in recent days are exaggerated, some speculative and 
some based on incorrect information. I think it is important 
right now not to focus on any detail, no matter piquant it is, 
but to think in more conceptual terms about the parcel with its 
ideas. We must perhaps stress one point: Majdal Shams is a 
village in which people live. 
  [Kohen] No, we are talking about all the Druze villages, 
with Majdal Shams only serving as the headline. 
  [Rabinovich] I do not want to focus on any village or area. 
I want to talk about the fact that when such negotiations are 
being conducted, we do not talk only in abstract terms. We 
should always remember that people and their fate are involved. 
We, as negotiators and anybody else involved, have to remember 
that such speculations involve the future of people. 
  [Kohen] I understand, of course, Mr. Ambassador, that you 
cannot refer concretely to the package or Majdal Shams First, 
but in an academic analysis, can you see the advantages such a 
formula has for al-Asad, as well as for Rabin? 
  [Rabinovich] I must temporarily forfeit the pleasure of an 
academic analysis because I am currently dealing with concrete 
negotiations and not academic life, but as I said previously, 
the package of ideas Secretary Christopher is carrying to 
Damascus is interesting and contains more than enough to permit 
the Syrians, if they wish to do so, to respond in an adequate 
fashion, and thereby to get the negotiating cart moving forward. 
  [Kohen] Ambassador Rabinovich, what influence do you think 
the time element has on the negotiations with the Syrians? Is a 
situation of continued stalemate -- for instance until 1996, the 
date of the Israeli general elections -- possible? 
  [Rabinovich] Of course, a deadlock and slow progress can go 
on without a time limit. In these negotiations we have never 
manifested to the Syrians a feeling that we are in a hurry. I 
think that from time to time the Syrians have learned that time 
is not a one-dimensional element and does not necessarily work 
against Israel or impose pressures on us. I think that last 
year the Syrians dragged their feet in the autumn and early 
summer and the outcome was that they found themselves facing the 
Oslo agreement with a different element. I think that was a 
bitter lesson for them, showing them that time does not 
necessarily move in one direction. From time to time we recall 
in a very relaxed way, without being pressured by time, that 
this window of opportunity is not unlimited time wise so that 
everybody involved in these negotiations remembers it. But, we 
do not have and do not transmit a feeling of concern or panic 
because of the passing of time. 
  [Kohen] Within the framework of Christopher's demands from 
al-Asad is there a demand to hold a summit meeting with Prime 
Minister Rabin? 
  [Rabinovich] There are no demands. The diplomatic and 
negotiating style of the Americans in general and Secretary 
Christopher in particular, is not one of making demands and 
applying pressures. He acts more like an attorney who 
transfers, not in a mechanical fashion, the positions of the 
sides, points to overlapping areas, and from time to time points 
to an interesting point where the sides meet, but he does not 
make demands or apply pressure. The Americans, like us, believe 
that more personal contact at the political echelon is good for 
the negotiations. This is for two reasons: First, meetings at 
the political level are part of the normalization process and 
evince a message to both societies -- Syrian and Israeli -- that 
their leaderships are in a process of conciliation, which is 
important. Second, in direct negotiations between leaders, who 
can make decisions, faster progress is sometimes possible since 
gaps can be closed by eliminating an emissary and transmittal 
time. That position is highly acceptable to us and I think is 
also acceptable to the Americans, and in fact, any objective 
observer of the negotiations. 
  [Kohen] To conclude, Mr. Ambassador, in your view, is their 
any chance that Christopher will return to Jerusalem early in 
the week with an iota of good tidings from Damascus? 
  [Rabinovich] I do not want to make forecasts, but if I look 
objectively at the package of ideas he took with him, then it 
would be very disappointing if the Syrians do not give him an 
adequate response in order to create an impetus in these 
negotiations.

  [Text] The cabinet is preparing for the signing ceremony 
of the agreement with the PLO in Cairo on Wednesday [4 May]. 
Today, the cabinet authorized Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to summarize the last details of 
the agreement and to sign it. The closure on the territories 
will continue out of security considerations, without any 
connection to the signing of the agreement. Our correspondent 
Sefi Hendler reports from the cabinet sessionz: 
  [Begin recording] [Hendler] Yitzhaq Rabin, as usual, was 
less than enthusiastic about briefing the cabinet ministers on 
the more significant political points included in Israel's 
proposals to Syria. Rabin refrained from addressing the subject 
throughout the entire meeting. Minister Yosi Sarid was not 
offended, asserting that secrecy was essential at this stage. 
  [Sarid] I think that the Syrian track necessitates almost 
total discretion to promote the negotiations' chances of 
succeeding. Right now, everyone should only know what he 
absolutely must. I think that whoever is supposed to know does. 
  [Hendler] Since the Syrian issue was not discussed, most of 
the cabinet session was devoted to the Palestinian track. The 
agreement due to be signed on Wednesday by Rabin and 'Arafat has 
yet to be fully formulated. Rabin and Peres told the ministers 
that four matters were still unresolved: The size of the 
Jericho area, problems with regard to the autonomy's 
jurisdiction, the Palestinian demand to station a policeman on 
the Allenby bridge, and the question of responsibility for the 
Gaza Strip's southern beaches. Since these issues have not yet 
been resolved, the cabinet gave Rabin and Peres a general 
authorization to conclude and sign the agreement. 
  At today's session, the prime minister and the chief of 
staff 
both mentioned the problematic nature of the transitional period 
between Israel's withdrawal and the assumption of control by the 
Palestinians. We are withdrawing and they have not yet assumed 
responsibility, Rabin said. The prime minister complained that 
the Palestinians failed to attend meetings and were holding up 
the transfer of civilian and security responsibilities. 
Ministers Sarid and Tzur commented on this at the end of the 
cabinet session. 
  [Tzur] The PLO is not demonstrating orderly working habits. 
We do not expect the coming days to be very pleasant. The 
transitional period will be difficult and I do not think that 
there are any situation analyses or expectations that terror 
attacks will cease. After the agreement is signed, we will have 
to implement a rapid transfer of civilian and military 
responsibilities. Clearly, the fact that the PLO has not primed 
itself for an orderly transfer will make the transition even 
more difficult. 
  [Sarid] There is cause for concern but also a great deal of 
hope. I think that the general picture is good and positive. 
In several days we will finally be out of the Gaza Strip. That 
is the main thing. That is what we promised and are about to 
implement. That is the first change in the situation on the 
ground since 1967 and we must take an optimistic and positive 
view. 
  [Hendler] The prime minister added that there was no 
intention for the time being to lift the closure on the 
territories, which was motivated by security considerations 
totally unconnected to the signing of the agreement. 
  The prime minister also devoted a large part of today's 
cabinet session to the issue of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
MIA's and POW's. The ministers received the impression that 
Rabin spoke with sorrow and pain about the mistakes made in the 
handling of the affair. Rabin noted that Yasir 'Arafat had 
given his word, his parole d'honneur [last two words in French], 
to help locate the soldiers missing in action since the battle 
of al-Sultan Ya'qub. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 1 May adds: 
"At the meeting, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq urged speeding up the 
evacuation of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area in view of the 
lack of coordination between Israel and the PLO on the transfer 
of power and land. The chief of staff said the territory should 
be evacuated as quickly as possible because the lack of 
coordination could endanger IDF soldiers. He also said the 
Palestinians have long-range plans to set up an independent 
state, which will include Jerusalem, and they want to realize 
the right of return. Minister Ora Namir had reservations about 
these remarks."] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 1 May 
reports: "Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur said that it might 
become necessary to evacuate certain settlements on the Golan 
Heights; however, Israel must not implement a full withdrawal. 
Tzur expressed the assessment that a full withdrawal would be a 
mistake because the security of the northern settlements could 
not be guaranteed without an Israeli presence on the Golan 
Heights."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Peres by political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik in the studio on 29 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Sukenik] The IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] withdrawal will be completed some two to three 
weeks after the agreement with the PLO is signed. Will the 
closure imposed on the territories be lifted? 
  [Peres] If the knives are set aside, the closure will be 
lifted. This time, however, they -- not just we -- will have an 
interest in removing the knives. They will be in charge of the 
well-being of the people. They will be in charge of their 
income, their security, and they will have to maintain relations 
with Israel that enable them to resume work in Israel. 
Previously, a Palestinian interest that focused on opposite 
goals was created. This time they have an interest in running 
their self-government. 
  [Sukenik] For example, do you foresee the possibility that 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the founder of Hamas, will be released from 
prison? 
  [Peres] If Ahmad Yasin announces he is for peace and against 
violence -- and not that he opposes violence only within the 
territories, as he previously said -- I am for releasing him. 
He is an old man with paralyzed legs. All that he has left is 
a mouth and a head. If he calls on his people to stop terrorism 
and embark on the path of negotiations, we will sit with him.

  [Text] The commander of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
Central Command informed the Jordan Valley settlers that as of 
Wednesday [4 May] morning they will not be permitted to enter 
the Jericho area. If they have to travel to Jerusalem they will 
have to travel on the security road adjacent to the border, 
which will be used to bypass Jericho. This was said by David 
Elhayani, head of the Jordan Valley settlements committee, to 
our correspondent Gil Litman. He said the settlers are 
extremely concerned about what is expected to take place after 
the establishment of autonomy in Jericho. He added that the 
settlers will launch protest actions against the establishment 
of the Jericho autonomous enclave.

  [Text] Reacting to claims by Jordan Valley settlers that 
they would no longer be permitted to drive through Jericho as of 
Wednesday [4 May], an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central 
Command spokesman clarified that there would be no traffic 
changes in the Jericho area after the inception of autonomy. 
The spokesman clarified that the road through Jericho would 
remain open to Israeli vehicles. 
  Major General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central 
Command, nevertheless decided to accede to the settlers' request 
and to open the road along the border near Jordan, which is 
currently being renovated.

  [Excerpt] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur told the 
Elqana Local Council plenum yesterday that "the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement will not serve as a precedent for the future agreement 
on the rest of Judaea and Samaria." Gur asserted that "this is 
also the view held by the prime minister." 
  Gur toured Elqana yesterday and participated in a special 
local council meeting. 
  Gur added that "a long time" will pass between the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and an agreement on 
Palestinian self-administration throughout the rest of Judaea 
and Samaria. Once again, Gur noted that this is also the prime 
minister's position. 
  Deputy Minister Gur also categorically denied the report 
that 
a special Army unit will be established to deal with the Jewish 
settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and described it 
as "complete nonsense." He also denied rumors of an intention 
to distribute identification tags to Jewish settlers to 
facilitate their passage through security checkpoints. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] The fifth of Ordibehesht [25 April] this week 
was the 14th anniversary of the U.S. abortive military attack on 
Tabas. A glance at events during this relatively lengthy period 
demonstrates that Washington has never abandoned attempts to 
attack Islamic Iran by various means. But just as in its attack 
on the Tabas desert all its attempts have somehow failed. 
  The continuous confrontation between the Islamic Republic of 
Iran [IRI] and the United States since the victory of the 
Islamic revolution has been one of the most complex 
confrontations of the recent decades, which have engaged two 
international political entities. Ploys and parameters 
exploited by Washington in this confrontation are very diverse 
and extensive. In the field of politics, the White House takes 
advantage of its influence in such international forums as the 
United Nations and Amnesty International. It does not miss an 
opportunity either to persuade or force member countries of such 
regional bodies as the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and the 
Arab League to pressure and isolate Iran. [passage omitted] 
  At present Washington is carefully monitoring every military 
purchase by Tehran. By exaggerating the Islamic Republic's 
military objectives and by repeating allegations that Iran is 
seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, it is pursuing some sort of 
covert embargo. Also in the confrontation against the Islamic 
revolution, the White House is extensively exploiting the lever 
of economic pressure. American officials exploit their 
relations with major European or Asian states to carefully 
monitor any expansion of economic ties between Iran and these 
states. To check the IRI's economic capabilities, the American 
officials on occasion have been prepared to pay a high price. 
These sorts of reactions by such a country as America seems odd 
and incredible, unless one tries to analyze these stances by 
understanding the depth of imperialism's grudge against Islam. 
  In the face of the diverse and extensive ploys designed by 
the U.S. strategists to confront the Islamic revolution, the IRI 
leadership, while being vigilantly aware of the complexity of an 
all-embracing struggle, is relying on two basic axes: First on 
Islam as a comprehensive and effective system to realize the 
revolution's short-term or long-term goals; and second on 
maintaining the people's presence to strengthen legitimacy of 
the regime. On the surface these two factors seem so simple, 
but they provide so much strength and have the potential to 
divert the continuous Washington-Tehran confrontation to favor 
the Islamic revolution in practice.

  Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- Two morning dailies Saturday 
severely criticized the British Government for accusing Iran of 
having established contacts with the Irish Republican Army (IRA). 
  The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' argued whether Britain or 
any other Western country had the right to question Iran's 
actions regarding adherence to internationally accepted 
conventions. 
  "From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have 
repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which 
regulate relations between individual countries," said the paper. 
  The editorial said the 1961 and 1963 Vienna Conventions 
requiring the observance of mutual diplomatic rules among 
nations have been openly ignored by the West through their overt 
and covert support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in 
their countries. 
  "Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead ignorance 
when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups 
they harbor in the West." 
  The paper noted that the Iranian Government has been under 
increasing domestic public opinion pressure for not allowing 
Bader-Meinhof, Direct Action or the IRA to have offices in 
Tehran while anti-Iranian terrorist groups enjoy almost full 
diplomatic rights in Bonn, Paris and London. 
  "The Iranian public opinion is consistently questioning the 
government why it adheres to international conventions regarding 
aiding and abetting terrorists when Western countries so openly 
and flagrantly ignore the same conventions." 
  The daily termed the latest baseless British protest over 
the Iran-IRA contact as a "smoke-screen to hide the fact that 
Western based anti-Iranian terrorists are providing material and 
personnel to the Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside 
the Islamic republic." 
  Commenting on the same subject the Persian daily 
`JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that apparently Tehran-London ties 
would never be stable because evidence shows that the Britons 
have constantly tried to mar mutual ties by taking advantage of 
the status quo. 
  It added that a review of Tehran-London political ties over 
the past 15 years reveals that not only such relations could 
never be relied on, the London government would occasionally 
misuse the ties under various pretexts. 
  The paper called on the Iranian authorities to bring the 
ties 
with London to the lowest possible level, especially in economic 
field. 
  It also recommended the decision-making bodies in the 
country 
to look into the new British game and not allow London to take 
advantage of such a political-propaganda ploy.

  [Text] London, Apr. 29, IRNA -- The British Government 
appeared intent Friday in continuing its fresh smear campaign 
against Iran with the prime minister's office saying it will 
"maintain vigilance" despite Tehran's rejection of IRA links as 
trumped up. 
  The Foreign Office also insisted that it was looking for a 
rapid reponse from the Iranian charge d'affaires to London, 
Gholam Reza Ansari, even though he has already "categorically 
denied" the allegations. 
  The charge d'affaires said that claims of Iranian contacts 
with the IRA in its campaign against British rule in Northern 
Ireland were "totally unsubtantiated" and suspected "elements" 
were at work to undermine diplomatic relations. 
  Ireland's prime minister, Albert Reynolds, is also sceptical 
about the claim. He said Thursday [28 April] he was unaware of 
any such link and "cannot accept any part of the allegations 
until they are established." 
  The FINANCIAL TIMES in London suspected that the 
allegations were connected to the U.S. campaign to isolate Iran 
economically following the American Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's talks with the British foreign secretary, Douglas 
Hurd, this week. 
  The charges, which have been accompanied by maximum 
publicity 
in the British press, are seen aimed at trying to embarrass 
European countries, who have recently worked to reschedule 
Iran's debt repayments. 
  The prime minister's office said Friday that it had informed 
European Union countries, the U.S., Canada and Japan of the 
fresh allegations and that their response was "supportive." 
  The timing follows several European countries building up 
better relations with Iran, including Ireland, whose marine 
minister, David Andrews has just returned from Tehran. The 
FINANCIAL TIMES also saw the move putting pressure on Japan's 
friendly ties. 
  A spokesman for the UK Foreign Office remained adamant 
Friday 
the government was still looking for a "very early response" 
from Iran to "immediately and conclusively sever" ties with the 
IRA. But he was unable to explain how this could be done when 
Iran had already totally rejected the claim. 
  The suggestion was there was never any reply likely to 
satisfy London's intentions of provoking a new diplomatic row, 
with the media here implying that it could lead to sanctions or 
expulsions, that have been so common in Britain's diplomatic 
policy. 
  The UK's hostility towards Iran has lingered since the 
Islamic revolution in 1979 causing London to lose out heavily in 
trade relations that have been filled by its European rivals, 
which unlike the UK, have been more pragmatic in improving ties 
with the Islamic republic.

  [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker, 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani, expressed wonder on the naivety 
of such a past master as the British Government and believed 
that London's becoming a tool in the hands of Washington and 
Israel intelligence services would not be beneficial for it. 
  Talking to IRNA, Rowhani who is also secretary of the 
Supreme 
National Security Council (SNSC), expressed surprise that the 
British Government raised so undocumented and hollow claims, at 
a time that European countries are adopting positive views on 
their relations with Iran. 
  He was referring to the recent British allegations that Iran 
is backing the Irish Republican Army (IRA). 
  Rowhani remarked that over the past 15 years Britain had 
kept 
a close connection with the armed terrorists fighting Iran and 
that its officials and media had repeatedly ignored the 
diplomatic norms by supporting the anti-revolutionaries both 
overtly and covertly. 
  "By backing terrorist groups they have violated 
international 
laws," said Rowhani. 
  He regretted that the British media had become an instrument 
for political games because its political figures realize better 
than all the hollowness of such claims. 
  "Iran, as a victim of terrorism, had always called on the 
Western countries especially the European Union to conduct 
coordinated and joint measures against armed terrorism but 
received no answer from them," he added. 
  Noting that Iran knew well what goals Britain pursued by 
such 
claims, the SCNS secretary invited Britain to bring its claims 
before the free world's public opinion, if it had any reliable 
documents, rather than creating tension between the two nations. 
  He said London's hollow claim is actually designed to cover 
up the failure of its police in confronting the IRA, as well as 
the public hatred that the British Government's support for the 
Serbs in the Balkans has aroused. 
  Referring to the presence of the American Secretary of 
State, 
Warren Christopher, in the Middle East, the Majles vice-speaker, 
said that the coordinated propaganda of the U.S., Israel and 
Britain against Iran, revealed a plot by this evil trio against 
the Islamic republic for its support for Palestian and Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  He was pleased to note that after 15 years Britain had come 
to realize that backing terrorist grouplets was wrong. 
  Rowhani concluded by repeating Iran's readiness for joint 
measures with the European countries and the European Union in 
particular against terrorism.

representatives of OIC member states in the United Nations. 
  During the meeting, he pointed out the need to lift the arms 
embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina and the readiness of the 
Islamic states to take part in the United Nations peace-keeping 
operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He also stressed on the necessity of the presence of OIC 
representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina peace talks as well as the 
formation of an air fleet by Muslim countries to provide 
humanitarian aids to Bosnians. 
  The foreign minister further elaborated on Iran's views 
Wednesday in the open session of the Security Council. The 
session was held at the request of Islamic countries to discuss 
lifting of the United Nations arms embargo against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Together with foreign ministers of OIC contact group, 
Velayati met with the secretary general of the United Nations, 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Thursday and reviewed the proposals and 
stands on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue.

  [Text] Our foreign minister, Dr. Velayati, returned to 
Tehran from New York last night and described the special 
session of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] contact 
group with the United Nations Security Council as unprecedented. 
The session was proposed by Iran and held at UN Headquarters 
with the efforts of the members of the contact group. 
  Dr. Velayati said: The extensive protest by Islamic 
countries about the Security Council's performance regarding 
Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted in the Security Council agreeing to 
send a 7,000-strong unit, that will include troops from Islamic 
countries such as Malaysia and Pakistan. According to the 
Central News Unit, Dr. Velayati commented on the demand by 
Islamic countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, to 
lift the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added: The ICO 
member countries are to draft a resolution on this issue and 
submit it to the Security Council. In the event of a veto by 
one of the Security Council members, the issue of lifting the 
arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina will be proposed to the UN 
General Assembly.

vice president; the Croatian prime minister [Nikica Valentic], 
and the Bosnian deputy prime minister [Edib Bukvic], regional 
issues, problems between the two countries [Bosnia and Croatia], 
and long-term mutual economic co-operation were discussed. 
  Also, in a meeting with Mr. Habibi, the Croatian prime 
minister condemned the Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
stressed the sovereignty and independence of the Muslim people 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and conveyed his country's willingness to 
engage in trilateral cooperation in various fields between Iran, 
Bosnia, and Croatia. Mr. Habibi, for his part, said the 
differences between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina assisted the 
Serbs in carrying out further attacks in Bosnia and added: the 
Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes the fact that the problems 
between the two countries are being resolved. 
  Mr. Habibi also held a meeting with the Bosnian deputy prime 
minister today and said: It is the right of the Muslim people of 
Bosnia to determine the destiny of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
struggles being carried out by these people against aggressors 
illustrates their determination to defend their identity and 
their country. The Bosnian deputy prime minister, for his part, 
described Iran as his second homeland and expressed gratitude 
for the support and assistance of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpts] Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who is in Tehran at the head of a 
delegation, was received today by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  According to a report by our correspondent, during the 
meeting the Bosnian deputy prime minister described the struggle 
of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Serbian 
aggressors as a struggle for safeguarding the Islamic 
aspirations of the whole world. Thanking the humanitarian 
support by the Iranian Government and people for the tyrannized 
people of Bosnia, he said: Iran is among the greatest friends 
and supporters of the people of Bosnia which, side by side, 
through its political and diplomatic efforts, continues that 
support in a practical way through humanitarian assistance. 
  The Bosnian deputy prime minister added: At the moment our 
nation pays the price for adhering to religious principles and 
its love of freedom. Speaking about the latest situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said: The Serbian aggressors are 
preparing themselves for another attack against the free areas 
in Bosnia so that by occupying more land in that area push our 
people to areas where there are no facilities for living. 
Continuing, the Bosnian deputy prime minister pointed out: 
Through reliance on God and through the efforts of the military 
forces, our honorable people, and the all- round political 
support by freedom loving states in the world we will thwart the 
enemies in achieving their ominous objectives. 
  According to the report, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, 
praising the brave defense of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in the face of the aggressors, said: The patience, endurance, 
jihad, and the oppression of Bosnian Muslims will be registered 
in the history of that country as an honorable example and 
juncture. [passage omitted comparing the current situation in 
Bosnia with others in history] 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani also stressed the need for increasing 
international efforts by Islamic states in order to prevent the 
annihilation of the Bosnian nation.

  [Text] As you have heard in the news, Edib Bukvic, the 
deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, left Tehran this 
morning and was seen off by the vice president for legal and 
parliamentary affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran this 
morning. 
  In the past three days, the Bosnian deputy prime minister 
held talks with high-level political and cultural officials of 
our country. In addition to issues pertaining to bilateral 
relations, the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the future of 
the country were also discussed and assessed. 
  The visit by the Bosnian deputy prime minister to Tehran 
almost coincided with the last few days of the Croatian 
minister's visit to Tehran. This provided a suitable 
opportunity for a positive diplomatic effort in Tehran for 
bringing the stances of the two countries closer. This is 
extremely important in assisting the Bosnian Muslim nation in 
its current difficult situation. In the course of these talks, 
the establishment of a Bosnian-Croatian confederation, which was 
proposed a few months ago and was approved by the Bosnian 
parliament, was also discussed. This plan appears to be 
welcomed by the two sides involved. 
  While in Tehran the deputy prime minister signed three 
memoranda of understanding for cooperation in the political, 
technical, scientific, and cultural fields with Iranian 
officials. Of course, in the current difficult conditions, 
these memoranda are more symbolic [preceding word in English] 
and indicate the wishes of two Muslim countries for cooperation 
in all fields. The Iranian nation, more than all the friends of 
the Bosnian nation, has displayed the greatest support and 
sympathy for the oppressed people of that country and special 
relations will be forged with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future 
as well. 
  However, in the current circumstances it is significant that 
the Iranian Government and people will muster all their efforts 
to ease the hardships of the Bosnian Muslim people and to help 
them extricate themselves from the present crisis. While doing 
this they will certainly encounter the animosity and plots of 
the common enemies of the Muslims.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] Edib Bukvic, the deputy prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived in Tehran yesterday for talks with 
Iranian officials on broadening bilateral relations. The 
Bosnian deputy prime minister, who is accompanied by a 
delegation of government officials, met with our vice president. 
In addition to issues pertaining to bilateral relations, the 
Bosnian delegation expressed its hope that the Islamic Republic 
of Iran's support for the efforts of the Bosnian Government and 
people to put an end to the inhuman atrocities being perpetrated 
by the Serbs and to find a humane and just solution to the 
Bosnian crisis would continue. 
  Upon his arrival in Tehran, Bukvic described the Islamic 
Republic of Iran as the Bosnian people's best friend, which is 
an indication of the deep relations between the two countries 
based on a longstanding and common Islamic culture which 
transcends all boundaries. In fact, despite the atrocities 
committed against the Bosnian Muslims and the propagandistic 
clamor in the mass media of various countries, the Bosnian 
Muslim nation has few friends. Even among those, there are not 
many who are ready to extend active support for the territorial 
integrity, independence, and survival of the oppressed Bosnian 
nation. The friendship of the Iranian nation with the Muslim 
Bosnian people, which is rooted in ideological bonds, is an 
example. 
  During the past two years of an unjust and unequal war 
against the Bosnian Muslims, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
actively extended serious support to the Bosnian people. 
Unstintingly and in the most difficult circumstances, it has 
risen in their support. The Islamic Republic of Iran has had to 
endure political pressures and restrictions and negative 
propaganda by the common enemies of the Iranian and Bosnian 
people because of this. 
  The Muslim Iranian nation has always declared its readiness 
to actively participate in the jihad of the Bosnian Muslims 
against the criminal Serbs. Recently, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran reiterated its willingness to dispatch military assistance 
in order to prevent the Serbs from continuing their crimes and 
aggression. In any case, the relations between the two Muslim 
nations of Iran and Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on ideological 
Islamic tenets, will continue to broaden in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Omar Behman, ambassador of </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina, by staff correspondent Karimlu in Tehran; 
date not given] 
  [Text] Q. What is the present situation in Gorazde? 
  A. It is tragic. The aggressors are committing crimes using 
their full military strength. Fortunately the Muslims and the 
Bosnian forces are defending the city. But if no step is taken 
Gorazde will certainly fall and the lives of 65,000 to 70,000 
inhabitants of the city will be at stake. We should not forget 
that Gorazde is only one example of the Serb crimes and 
aggression. There are other places in Bosnia which are currently 
under the boots of the Serbs. A fresh force of 10,000 has just 
been dispatched to areas around Gorazde from Serbia. Some other 
Serbian troops who have evacuated areas near Sarajevo, have come 
to Gorazde. And despite all the crimes they are committing, the 
Serbs are constantly receiving oil and food in violation of the 
UN economic sanctions. This is under conditions that the UN 
forces would not allow Muslims to receive even a single bullet. 
The main responsibility of the UN is to defend Bosnia but the 
organization has failed even to stop the aggressor Serbs to the 
extent that we can claim the UN itself is an accomplice in this 
aggression and is helping the Serbs to violate the rights of the 
Bosnian people. 
  Q. What is your opinion about NATO? 
  A. At the outset it seemed that they wanted to help, but 
later it became clear that they have no intention to defend the 
wronged party. NATO is not an independent force, it carries out 
the instructions it receives from the UN and its Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Q. What is the current situation in Sarajevo? What about 
the people's demonstration in the city? 
  A. It is getting worse and worse every day. The enemy is 
sniping at the city and in some cases they even launch artillery 
attacks. The UN forces have returned the heavy arms and 
artilleries collected from the Serbs earlier. 
  Concerning the demonstration, the people suddenly poured 
into 
the streets and voiced their hatred of international 
organizations and called for assistance. The Serbs are being 
allowed to commit more and more crimes and this has made the 
situation very critical. 
  Q. Would you comment on the use of chemical weapons by the 
Serbs? 
  A. The aggressors used chemical weapons in their first 
attacks on the bunkers of the Bosnian forces outside the city 
(Gorazde) and thus succeeded in breaking the defense line of the 
city. I am not sure about the precise number of the martyrs and 
wounded of the chemical attacks. Military sources have put the 
number of the casualties after the Serbs broke into the city, at 
400 killed and 1000 wounded. But the point is that the 
populated villages near Gorazde are also under the control of 
the Serbs and it is not known how many people have been killed 
and wounded there. In view of the fact that there is no link 
between Gorazde and outside, it is very difficult to have an 
exact number of casualties at this time. 
  Q. What do you think about the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  A. It is very hard to say. As we know the war is going on. 
Our enemies are determined to exterminate the Muslims in this 
region and it is very difficult to counter them with empty hands. 
  Q. Following the letter sent to Butrus-Ghali by Mr. 
Izetbegovic, is there any hope that the UN would help? 
  A. The UN and the Security Council exist only in appearance 
but the decisions are made behind the curtain and by the 
superpowers. The UN has in fact no role in the decision-making 
process. Furthermore, Mr. Butrus-Ghali has proved that he has no 
determination of his own and has failed even to fulfill the 
simplest obligations of his organization. He is only waiting 
for the big powers to instruct him what to do, acting like, a 
slave. But we remember that the previous chief of the UN stood 
against Russia and the U.S. several times and carried out what 
it wished to do. 
  Q. What are your expectations from the Islamic Republic of 
Iran [IRI]? 
  A. The IRI, its government and people have been on our side 
from the beginning of the war and helped us as far as they 
could. We think them all and we are confident that they will 
continue to be with us in the future.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Russia Will Pay the Price for Western </F>
Duplicity in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Despite NATO's latest stern warning to the Serbs to 
cease firing on Gorazde and pull back from the town, the 
military alliance still does not want to use its forces to stop 
Serbian aggression against Bosnia. One of the main reasons is 
purely economical. In plain language, 'there is nothing in it 
for NATO members.' 
  After NATO, led by U.S. forces, attacked the Iraqis and 
expelled them from Kuwait, U.S.-based multinational corporations 
got the lion's share of the lucrative contracts awarded by 
Kuwait for rebuilding that country. Other Western countries, 
depending on the pecking order, also claimed their share of the 
spoils of that war. 
  Crude oil has existed under the Kuwaiti desert for thousands 
of years. Luckily, this precious commodity does not spoil even 
if left underground for many more centuries. When U.S.-led 
forces liberated Kuwait, the country was devastated but its 
wealth was almost intact prompting Western politico-military 
investment in its liberation. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina has also been totally devastated, but in 
contrast to Kuwait, it has no natural resources to speak of, 
ergo the Western delaying tactics in evicting the aggressors 
from this beleaguered and newly independent country. The West, 
following one of the basic tenets of Capitalism and applying its 
usual double standards, considers the cost of its involvement in 
the Bosnian-Serb crisis to be too high and its financial rewards 
too little to make it worthwhile. However, in order to keep up 
appearances in world forums, the West has to find a way of 
wiggling out this mess without accepting any blame. This is 
where the Russian factor comes into play. 
  The United States introduced the Russian trump card exactly 
at the juncture when the world public opinion demanded UN-NATO 
action to end Serbian aggression against Bosnia. All of a 
sudden Russia had to be brought into the NATO decision-making 
process. The United States and its allies insist that there can 
be no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Russians are 
allowed to participate in NATO's plans to end the Serbo-Bosnian 
war. This logic indicates that the West considers Russia, 
despite its diminished stature, to be an important military 
power deserving of being included in the resolution of global 
conflicts. However, when the U.S.-led UN forces attacked the 
Iraqi army, the opposition of the all powerful Soviet Union was 
totally ignored by the U.S. and its allies. 
  Russia, for its own domestic reasons, needs to pretend that 
it is still the same menacing `bear' it used to be before it 
disintegrated. But the successors to the Communist Empire must 
realize that by promoting the Serbian `cause' they are playing 
right into the hands of the Western political puppeteers who 
plan to sit this war out and blame their inaction on Russia's 
opposition to the use of force against the Serbs. 
  Russia must realize that if it allows itself to be used as 
an 
excuse for Western duplicity in Bosnia, it will do irreparable 
damage to its already fragile relations with Muslim countries 
and their more than one billion collective population.

  [Text] What have been happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina since 
its independence a couple of years ago is a clear picture 
depicting the so-called new world order. A defenseless and 
innocent nation is being butchered by the brutal and 
armed-to-the-teeth Serbs, while the international organizations 
and the so-called free world are watching and sucking their 
thumbs! 
  There are big lessons in this for other developing countries 
of the world, specially those which want to preserve and 
safeguard their cultural and religious integrity against imposed 
foreign cultural values. They should be ready since after 
Gorazde and after the fall of other so-called safe havens in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina it might be their turn. Of course, gradually 
and one by one, they will become the victims of the new world 
order or better yet disorder. 
  With situation the way it is, at the turn of the century the 
world is moving towards a chaotic era in its history. The 
United Nations, which at least as a matter of face-saving, used 
to defend the victims of aggression, has turned into an 
instrument in the hands of Western countries to preserve their 
interest when and where necessary. 
  A look at the recent conflicts in the world, like what 
happened in Somalia or the ongoing Bosnian crisis, would reveal 
that the world is moving towards a new world disorder instead of 
order. Under such circumstances, a weak nation will be a victim 
of aggression, either directly by the powerful countries or 
indirectly through these powerful countries' allies. Two clear 
examples of this fact is Washington's direct intervention in 
Somalia and Russian backed Serbian aggression against the 
innocent people of Bosnia. 
  Former colonial powers are dreaming about their "golden 
ages" 
of 17th, 18th and 19th centuries when they had colonies all over 
the globe. Gorazde is a visible example of colonization of an 
independent and free country by another nation. While the 
Western powers are united, unfortunately, the developing 
countries and in particular the Islamic nations, despite their 
economic potentials and vast natural resources, are so divided 
that, for instance, they are unable to use their natural 
resources as a weapon to exert pressure on Serbia to halt its 
aggression.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic arrived 
in our country after the arrival in Tehran of the Bosnian deputy 
prime minister. In an interview with correspondents upon 
arrival, he said: If a confederation plan for Bosnia and Croatia 
fails to succeed, the international community will pay a heavy 
price. [passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran, which recently has hosted 
prominent Bosnian and Croatian authorities, not only gives 
prominence to mutual economic, communications, and political 
ties with Bosnia and Croatia, but also endeavors to play the 
role of a mediator to bond the two countries of Bosnia and 
Croatia and, through bringing their stances closer together, to 
pave the way for the creation of stable and peaceful relations 
in the Balkans. [passage omitted] 
  The role played by Iran, as the closest ally and a supporter 
of the oppressed Bosnian nation, in resolving the Balkan crisis 
through efforts aimed at establishing a confederation of Bosnia 
and Croatia -- a plan that was approved by the Bosnian 
parliament three months ago -- has gained further prominence and 
is indicative of the realization of Iran's spiritual and 
diplomatic influence by its guests from the Balkans. That is 
why the Croatian prime minister has called on Iran to stop the 
recurrence of clashes, which stem from misunderstanding between 
the Croats and the Muslims, and to support the confederation 
plan. 
  Apart from the Bosnian issues, the Croatian prime minister 
will also hold talks with our country's officials on relations 
between Tehran and Zagreb. Those ties will include trade 
exchanges and economic and communications cooperation. 
Significant outcome is expected from the talks in that respect.

  [Text] Tehran, May 2, IRNA -- Leader of the Islamic 
Revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i received the visiting 
Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh here Monday and praised the 
bravery and resistence of the Vietnamese people in defending 
their dignity during the war. 
  The leader described as "highly positive" the perception of 
the Iranians of Vietnamese people and pointed to their 
resistance against the aggressor as a common point between the 
two nations and a suitable ground for the expansion of future 
relations. 
  The Vietnamese president in response called as very 
"fruitful" his talks with President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and 
lauded the Iranians' resistance during the eight-year imposed 
war on Iran. 
  Anh also stressed that Hanoi was interested in cementing 
cordial relations with Tehran and expanding bilateral 
cooperation in political, economic, cultural, scientific and 
technological fields. 
  President Rafsanjani and a number of high-ranking officials 
were also present in the meeting. The Vietnamese president 
arrived here last Saturday on a three-day official visit. 
  In another development, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati 
and Vietnamese president discussed expansion of relations in all 
fields, upgrading of Tehran-Hanoi cooperation at international 
forums and other issues of mutual interest in a meeting here 
Sunday. 
  During the meeting Anh reiterated promotion of Tehran-Hanoi 
ties in all fields and said that formation of the joint 
commission had played a significant role in further cementing 
bilateral cooperation. 
  He also stressed the need for further contacts between the 
two countries as a means to pave the way for future agreements. 
  Referring to the first session of Iran-Vietnam joint 
commission which was recently held in Tehran, Velayati said it 
indicated that the two countries have gained major achievements 
in bilateral relations. 
  Pointing to regional issues including the Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM), Velayati said that Tehran-Hanoi cooperation in 
the organization was a good example of south-south relations. 
  At the end of the meeting Anh underlined the need for 
Tehran-Hanoi further cooperation in NAM, cementing of ties 
between South-South countries and further rapprochement of the 
South-North states.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh arrived in Tehran 
yesterday at the head of a high-level delegation and was 
received by our country's officials. In the course of this 
visit, the first by a Vietnamese president to Tehran, bilateral 
relations, regional and international issues are to be discussed. 
  Vietnam is one of the southeastern countries and it has a 
population of 70 million and rich, abundant resources. This 
country has endured two major crises; that is, a war with the 
United States and its 19-year-long embargo, as well as intense 
differences with the PRC on Cambodia. Hanoi has now entered a 
new phase of reconstruction since the Cold War has ended and the 
nature of its international relations has metamorphosed from 
military to economic one. 
  Vietnam's basic strategy is to strengthen its reconstruction 
process by favoring regional cooperation. That is why the Hanoi 
government's declared program is to base its foreign policy on 
broadening and expanding international relations. Regional and 
neighboring countries are given special preference in this 
regard. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran has certain similar 
characteristics, as Iran inherited a prolonged period of 
backwardness, which is a remnant of the previous regime. The 
Iranian nation also initiated extensive struggles against U.S. 
intervention in Iran's internal affairs and continues to do so. 
Similarly, Iran fought an eight-year-long war with an 
aggressor, Iraq, which resulted in immense loss of life and 
property for Iran. 
  Now that Iran has put these crises behind it, effective 
steps 
have been taken for the country's reconstruction and the basic 
strategy is to carry out this reconstruction successfully with 
the assistance and cooperation of friendly countries. Thus, 
tasting the bitterness of foreign intervention, enduring an 
unjust war, being in the orbit of the developing countries of 
the south, embarking on basic reconstruction, and favoring 
regional closeness, are the common denominators which motivate 
these two countries to adopt a joint strategy. 
  Most important of all, Iran and Vietnam are at that juncture 
of their development when their cooperation can address most of 
their respective needs. Vietnam has a developing economy and in 
the opinion of political and economic analysts, this country 
needs a foreign investment of $12 to $15 billion to boost its 
economic and industrial structure in order to reach an 
eight-percent level of growth by the year 2000. 
  Iran can have effective cooperation with Vietnam in the 
field 
of investment, and in particular, in gas and oil. In addition, 
in view of its proximity to the Central Asian countries, Iran 
can play an important role in the transit of Vietnamese products 
to those republics. Reciprocally, Vietnam can prove of benefit 
to Iran by the transfer of its technological experience in 
various fields, especially in agriculture and industry. 
  However, it appears that despite the actual and potential 
capability of the two countries and the broadening of their 
political relations, the volume of their exchanges is not very 
satisfactory. Therefore, Iran and Vietnam should expand their 
joint economic commissions and sign trade accords especially on 
a quid pro quo basis, and thus take effective steps to improve 
their relations.

  [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- An English daily here 
Saturday commented on the desire that both Iran and Iraq have 
expressed in recent years to improve mutual ties and called on 
the two countries to iron out differences. 
  The idea of "trust" as pointed out by Iraq's deputy foreign 
minister, who recently paid a visit to Iran, is a key word in 
the absence of which nothing can be accomplished between the two 
countries, wrote 'KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' in its editorial. 
  "In fact", the paper said, "since a year or two after the 
termination of active hostilities between the two countries, 
both Tehran and Baghdad have tried to bring about that needed 
atmosphere of trust so that as a next step dialogue can be 
established to resolve the many outstanding issues between them". 
  If up to now there has been little or perhaps no advance in 
the resolution of issues it must be because there has been a 
pronounced failure in the efforts to establish that element of 
trust, the daily noted. The article then referred to the bomb 
explosion in Tehran on April 19 and said that the Iranian 
disciplinary forces have blamed, for the first time, Baghdad for 
having been behind the incident. 
  "No country should support terrorist activities jeopardizing 
the lives of innocent people in other countries. That holds 
specially true about Baghdad in view of its ongoing economic and 
political isolation under the U.N. sanctions." 
  The daily advised Baghdad to open a new chapter in its 
foreign relations with other countries based on understanding 
and trust to help alleviate the suffering of its people as a 
result of the past two wars. 
  The element of trust is specially of great importance in 
Baghdad's relations with Iran in view of the nature and 
magnitude of the unresolved issues, the paper noted. The 
approval of bomb planting in a busy Tehran street goes directly 
counter to the spirit of desire for normalized ties with Tehran, 
the daily said adding that Baghdad has more enemies on its hands 
than it can handle and there is no reason why it should want to 
aggravate ties with Iran. 
  The paper concluded by saying that Iran and Iraq have a lot 
in common and Tehran can become a helpful future friend for Iraq 
if differences are ironed out.

  [Text] The Thamen al-A'emmeh shore-to-sea missile maneuver 
ended today by achieving all its objectives. According to a 
report dispatched by the Central News Unit from the Persian Gulf 
center, during the concluding phase of this maneuver the brave 
personnel of the navy of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, by utilizing the most advanced 
missile system, performed the operations of firing a 
shore-to-sea missile with full success. 
  Rocket fuel manufactured by Iran was used for the first time 
during these courageous operations, and the shore-to-sea missile 
precisely hit the hypothetical enemy. 
  On the last day of this maneuver there were also naval 
operations, tracking, reconnaissance and patrol operations. The 
flight units flew over the operational area, utilizing the most 
modern tactics and combat-defense inventions.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, </F>
head of the Islamic Propaganda Organization and acting Friday 
prayers leader, in Tehran on 29 April -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is being said that in the 
future instead of an oil war we will have a water war in the 
world. Even now, Israel is stealing water. It is trying to 
divert the waters of Lebanon and take them to its own side. In 
other places also there is fighting over water. They sit down 
with Turkey and talk about water. 
  May God bestow some intelligence on those who, due to 
distorted thinking, provide a foothold for the Israelis to come 
to the Islamic countries. They do not realize that they are 
inciting their own people against themselves. Turkey is an 
Islamic country. Even if the Turkish officials turn the world 
upside down, Turkey is an Islamic country. The Turkish nation 
has not deserted Islam. No matter what Ataturk said, he said it 
simply for his own benefit. The Turkish people are Muslims. Can 
Muslim people tolerate the fact that Israel, which is killing 
Muslims, will find a foothold in their country, and that Turkish 
officials are making such arrangements? 
  In any case, we need to make savings in water, in 
electricity, and in other things. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage indistinct] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad denied 
that interviews conducted by Qatari television on an Iraqi 
street and with Iraqi officials have caused a rift in relations 
between the State of Kuwait and Qatar. 
  He said: "We do not consider this subject a rift. There is 
understanding within the GCC and the GCC members are the closest 
of people to each other." 
  On a question related to the religious phenomenon in Kuwait, 
Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that it was an internal Kuwaiti 
phenomenon unconnected with the phenomenon of international 
religious terrorism or any external body. 
  He said: "We accept this phenomenon since we consider it to 
be an internal Kuwaiti phenomenon which does not believe in what 
others do." 
  On a question related to the State of Kuwait's stance on the 
Palestinian cause, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that a 
differentiation must be made between the Palestinian cause and 
the Palestinian leadership, which has wronged Kuwait. He said 
that throughout its history the State of Kuwait has been one of 
the most supportive of the Palestinian cause and will continue 
to support the Palestinian people, but not through the current 
leadership. 
  He recalled that the State of Kuwait has granted $25 million 
through international bodies to set up schools and hospitals in 
Gaza and Jericho. He explained that only small groups of 
Palestinians have been deported from Kuwait, and that those who 
left Kuwait have done so at their own will. 
  In answer to a question related to Kuwait's stance on the 
Arab boycott of Israel, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad stressed that 
Kuwait abides by the Arab League resolutions related to the 
first degree boycott of Israel. He said that after its 
liberation from Iraq, Kuwait had been obliged to lift the second 
and third degree boycott because of its pressing need for 
companies which possess technology and expertise in those areas 
destroyed by the Iraqi forces during their occupation of Kuwait.

  [Text] Riyadh, April 30 (AFP) -- Yemen's Planning Minister 
'Abd- al-Karim al-Iryani arrived here Saturday [30 April] with a 
message for King Fahd dealing with the situation in Yemen and a 
bilateral border dispute, officials said. 
  Al-Iryani's visit came amid reports of fresh clashes between 
rival northern and southern Yemeni troops in the 'Imran region, 
60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Sanaa. 
  The minister told AFP the message, from President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, was a response to a message Salih received from 
the king 10 days ago. 
  Al-Iryani refused to comment on the conflict between forces 
loyal to Salih and those backing the president's southern rival 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  A southern military spokesman in Aden said elite northern 
Republican Guards "resumed criminal actions against elements of 
the (southern) third armoured brigade." 
  Ferocious tank battles in the same area Wednesday and 
Thursday left nearly 200 dead and dozens of others wounded, 
according to journalists. 
  The Saudi-Yemeni border dispute centres on the provinces of 
'Asir, Najran and Jizan, which were handed to Saudi Arabia under 
an agreement signed in 1934. Yemen, which claims the provinces, 
says the accord expired in 1992. 
  Saudi-Yemeni relations soured following Iraq's August 1990 
invasion of Kuwait, when Yemeni leaders voiced support for Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  Al-Iryani said the next round of bilateral talks on the 
border problem would be held in Riyadh around May 20.

  [Text] Paris, April 29 (AFP) -- This is a summary of the 
main points of the agreement signed by Israel and the PLO 
covering economic relations once Palestinian autonomy begins in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as provided by the Israeli 
delegation: 
<H5>  IMPORT POLICY </H5>
  Israel and the Palestinian Authority will have an import 
policy basically similar in all respects regarding imports and 
customs. Nonetheless, the Palestinian Authority will be able to 
import mutually agreed goods at customs rates differing from 
those prevailing in Israel, following jointly agreed import 
procedures. Moreover, it will be able to import goods from Arab 
countries, in agreed, limited quantities. Arrangements will be 
made for the two customs authorities to jointly operate the 
border crossing in Jericho and Gaza. 
<H5>  MONETARY POLICY </H5>
  The Palestinian Authority will establish a monetary 
authority, whose main functions will be the regulating and 
supervision of the banks operating in the Area, the 
determination within certain limits of the liquidity ratios on 
deposits, the management of foreign exchange reserves and the 
supervision of foreign exchange transactions. 
  The two sides will continue to discuss the possibility of 
issuing various alternatives of a Palestinian currency. To 
encourage trade, they will mutually allow the opening of bank 
branches. Until then, the NIS (Israeli shekel) will continue to 
constitute a legal means of payment in the autonomy's areas side 
by side with other currencies. 
<H5>  DIRECT TAXATION </H5>
  The Palestinian Tax Administration will conduct its own 
direct tax policy, including income tax on individuals and 
corporations, property taxes and municipal rates and fees, 
according to the policy and the rates determined by the 
Palestinian Authority. 
  The two parties will collect income taxes on economic 
activities conducted in their respective areas. Israel will 
transfer to the Palestinian Authority 75 per cent of the 
revenues from the income tax collected from Palestinians 
employed in Israel. 
<H5>  INDIRECT TAXATION </H5>
  A VAT [value-added tax] system similar to that operating in 
Israel will be operated also by the Palestinian Authority. 
  The VAT rates of the Palestinian Authority will be between 
15 
per cent and 16 per cent. 
<H5>  LABOR </H5>
  Work in Israel is essential for the Palestinians expanding 
their employment opportunities; The guiding principle in this 
sphere is to enable mutual movement of labor. 
  The rights of Palestinian workers employed in Israel will be 
preserved according to arrangements existing in Israel, a social 
security system being established in the meantime by the 
Palestinians. 
<H5>  AGRICULTURE </H5>
  Agriculture produce from the autonomy will enter Israel 
freely, except for five goods on which agreed import quotas have 
been imposed for five years: tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, 
eggs, and broilers. 
<H5>  MANUFACTURING </H5>
  There will be free movement of goods manufactured in the 
Area. 
<H5>  TOURISM </H5>
  A Palestinian tourist administration will be set up to 
manage 
subjects related to tourism in the areas of the Palestinian 
Authority. Tourists will move freely between Israel and the 
autonomy. 
  Tourist agencies, touring companies and tourist guides will 
be able to operate "on the other side" provided they satisfy the 
relevant professional criteria. 
<H5>  FUEL </H5>
  The price of gasoline in the autonomy will be determined 
according to the autonomy's costs in purchasing it, and the 
taxes levied on gasoline in the autonomy. The agreement 
stipulates that the prices of gasoline will not fall short by 
more than 15 per cent of the maximum gasoline price in Israel. 
<H5>  INSURANCE </H5>
  The agreement deals with two main topics: 
  a. The full transfer of the licensing and supervision 
authority over the insurance business in the areas of the 
Palestinian Authority. 
  b. An agreement for the compulsory insurance of motor 
vehicles and the compensation of the victims of road accidents 
based on: 
  - The Palestinian Authority maintain in its area a system of 
compulsory insurance of motor vehicles in the form existing in 
Israel, but with limited compensation. 
- Policies issued by the Palestinian Authority being valid 
also in Israel, and victims there being compensated according to 
the Israeli laws; and Israeli policies being valid in the areas 
of the Palestinian Authority.

  [Text] Immediately after the signing of the agreement in 
Cairo on Wednesday, the release of the first half of the 5,000 
Palestinian prisoners slated to be released will commence. The 
release process will continue until the beginning of the week 
following the signing of the agreement. Twelve hours after the 
agreement is signed, the Palestinian police force will start 
moving from Egyptian Rafah into the Gaza Strip via the Rafah 
border terminal. Palestinian sources told our correspondent 
Moti Amir that the convoy will include jeeps, light armored 
cars, and approximately 1,500 policemen under Raji Jabali, 
commander of the Gaza Strip police. They will be accompanied by 
Muhammad Dahlan, head of the Gaza Strip security services, who 
is considered to be the strong man in the Gaza Strip. 
  Approximately 500 policemen will arrive in Jericho, but it 
is 
still unclear whether they will enter from Gaza, via the open 
passage agreed upon by the two sides, or from Jordan, via the 
Allenby Bridge. The policemen will be accompanied by 
administrative workers from the PLO headquarters in Tunis, and 
Jibril al-Rajub, head of the Palestinian security services in 
the West Bank. 
  Yasir 'Arafat will apparently arrive in the territories on 
15 
June, after preparations in the field and the organization of 
the Palestinian institutions in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He 
will be received in a large ceremony attended by ambassadors and 
possibly heads of state.

  [Text] 
<H5>  We Are Still Holding Contacts With Christian Parties, </H5>
Including the Lebanese Forces. [Signed] U.S. Ambassador Mark 
Hambley 
  U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley is regarded as the most active 
U.S. ambassador who has served in Lebanon, in terms of official 
and political meetings. 
  Ambassador Mark Hambley, who had previously served in Beirut 
as a second-category staff member of the embassy, came to 
Lebanon having served in two areas of particular importance. 
Before assuming the post of consul in Alexandria, Hambley was 
the U.S. charge d'affaires in Tunis. 
  Both Alexandria and Tunis are vital areas for the Americans. 
Tunis is quite important and vital for the U.S. and Israeli 
intelligence due to the strong ties between the Tunisian regime 
and these intelligence services. This fact enabled both 
services to monitor the Palestinian activities continuously. 
Alexandria, an Egyptian town, is regarded as an extremely 
important area by the Americans and Israelis, because it is 
located near Libya and Palestine and overlooks the 
Mediterranean. Alexandria can play a great mediation role in 
the projected settlement process. 
  According to available information, the designation of 
Hambley as U.S. ambassador in Beirut to succeed Ryan Crocker was 
based on his service in Alexandria and Tunis. He came to Beirut 
with a file containing ample information about the Lebanese 
situation. After his arrival, Hambley formed a working team at 
the embassy to conduct studies and political analyses to be 
dispatched to Washington. 
  Knowledgeable sources view the U.S. move as indicating 
exploration of the stances of all forces and parties and of 
having first-hand information on the Lebanese situation. 
  Furthermore, Hambley's action represents a strong move into 
the Lebanese domestic policy, particularly the Christians, to 
reassure them that the United States supports them. This 
explains Hambley's keenness on continuing contacts with the 
various Christian parties, particularly the Lebanese Forces, 
despite the latter's dissolution. This is interference in the 
Lebanese situation, because the existing contacts between 
Hambley and the Lebanese Forces one way or another represent a 
rejection of the Lebanese authorities' decision to dissolve the 
Lebanese Forces, and represent a U.S. attempt to buoy them up in 
service of the hostile designs. 
  Other information indicates that Ambassador Hambley is 
holding continuous meetings with Christian opposition figures 
and he is sending several signals to Ja'ja'.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
stressed that Egypt made tremendous efforts to help achieve the 
signing next Wednesday of an agreement on the implementation of 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. It helped 
the two sides overcome most of the obstacles that hindered the 
agreement, he said. 
  In a statement appearing today in MAYU, which speaks for the 
National Democratic Party, Mubarak said that despite obstacles 
the Golan Heights will soon return to Syria. He noted that 
Syria and Israel are eager for peace and that Egypt is helping 
the two sides surmount the difficulties so that an agreement can 
be reached. 
  On the situation in Yemen, Mubarak addressed a new appeal to 
the parties to the conflict in fraternal Yemen to demonstrate 
self-restraint and prevent bloodshed for the sake of the Yemeni 
people's future. 
  On the results of his recent visits to China and some Arab 
countries, Mubarak stressed that the trip to China was extremely 
fruitful and produced positive results. He noted the need for 
continued cooperation between Egypt and China. 
  President Mubarak emphasized the need for boosting 
Egyptian-Chinese relations in all fields because China, with its 
formidable capabilities, will play a more influential role in 
international politics. 
  He explained that China agreed to reschedule Egypt's debts. 
He said the move, a privilege not given to any other country, 
reflects an appreciation of Egypt's status and role on the 
international scene. 
  Mubarak said that he had rejected an idea to delay his visit 
to China. I insisted on going to Beijing on the scheduled date, 
although I postponed my visit to Japan because of that country's 
government crisis, he said. 
  On his visits to a number of Arab countries before and after 
his trip to China, Mubarak said: I am always eager for 
coordination and an exchange of views with Arab leaders on all 
issues of concern to the region and on international issues of 
mutual concern. 
  He added: I am eager to meet with Arab leaders whenever I 
have a chance. During my recent tour, I met with Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id of Oman. I have the closet ties with the Sultan and 
the Omani people. Regarding the United Arab Emirates, its 
positions toward us are honorable. Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan is a 
dear friend, and when we meet we discuss all issues frankly and 
in a brotherly spirit and we always arrive at identical 
viewpoints. 
  On relations with Bahrain, President Mubarak said the 
Bahraini people are really kind and proud of their relations 
with Egypt. My meetings with Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah 
are always characterized by cordiality and understanding, he 
said. 
  President Mubarak added: I was willing to conclude my trip 
with a visit to fraternal Saudi Arabia to meet with my brother 
the custodian of the two holy mosques, King 
Fahd-Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Crown Prince 'Abdallah, and the leaders 
of the kingdom. I proceeded from eagerness to coordinate and 
exchange views with them on all issues of concern to the region 
and the world. Saudi Arabia is a big, influential Gulf state 
and agreements between us reflect positively on our fraternal 
peoples. 
  On the implementation of the economic reform program in 
Egypt, Mubarak told MAYU that the world economy is now unstable, 
causing higher prices. Egypt is affected by this, but we are 
concerned that people with low income not be hurt, he said. 
  He added: In the reform plan we are fully committed to 
certain principles. We do not approve any new loans except when 
there is an urgent need and we are making strenuous efforts to 
write off half of our foreign debts. 
  Concluding his statement, President Mubarak renewed his call 
for investors to establish their projects in Egypt on lands 
where the state has provided facilities. Projects costing about 
10 million pounds do not need permission from any quarter, he 
said. 
  President Mubarak explained that a good economy supports the 
climate of freedom and democracy. We are interested in 
reforming Egypt's economy and establishing it on firm and strong 
bases so that freedom and democracy will flourish, he said.

  [Text] Amman--Ten Jordanian Islamist and leftist parties 
have joined hands to demand a total end to all inspections of 
Jordan-bound cargo as part of the enforcement of sanctions 
against Iraq and called on Arab, Islamic, non-aligned and 
African countries to support the Kingdom's stand. 
  In a rare joint statement, the 10 parties, including the 
powerful Islamic Action Front (IAF) and mostly leftist parties, 
did not directly refer to the agreement Jordan has reached with 
the U.S. to replace the sea-based inspections by a U.S.-led 
naval task force with a land-based sanctions verifications 
regime. 
  But it rejected "any inspections in Jordanian territory, 
whether at sea or land," as "and infringement of Jordan's 
sovereignty," 
  Official party spokesmen were not immediately available for 
comment, but party sources said the statement was deliberately 
left vague since the 10 groups, which espouse varying ideologies 
ranging from Islamic law, socialism, Ba'thism and pan-Arab 
nationalism, could not agree on a unified stand to reject the 
land-based verifications before the modalities of the 
arrangement were known. 
  The sources said some of the parties would not outrightly 
reject the land-based arrangement as long as it is conducted 
under the direct supervision of the United Nations with no 
American intervention while others did not want any inspections 
in any form of shape, they said. 
  "Some of the parties are aware that for the moment there is 
no escape from some kind of mechanism at al-'Aqabah and they 
wanted to reflect that position in the statement," said one 
source. "But there is unanimous agreement that the inspections 
are unacceptable to Jordan and should be rejected as a form of 
pressure aimed at the Kingdom and its people." 
  After a meeting with His Majesty King Husayn in London on 
Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
Washington would support, subject to some "fine tuning," the 
Jordanian proposal that Lloyds Register of London conduct the 
sanctions-verifications at the port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Lloyds Register of London is described as a non-profit, 
independent international organisation with no political 
affiliations. 
  The American acceptance of the proposal came after more than 
three years of Jordanian complaints that the sanctions were not 
only causing heavy economic losses to the Kingdom but also 
reflected distrust of the Kingdom despite its record of 
adherence to U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
  The U.S. agreed to the proposal to change the sanctions 
regime nearly one month after Jordan made its return to peace 
talks with Israel contingent on an end to inspections. 
  The two-page statement of the 10 parties, issued Thursday, 
said the continued inspections were a "punishment for the stand 
that Jordan and its people adopted during the Gulf crisis" by 
calling for an Arab solution to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait 
and refusing foreign intervention on Arab soil. 
  The inspections "constitute an aggression against the 
Jordanian people, who have paid a heavy price for the Gulf 
crisis in the form of poverty, high unemployment and social and 
economic problems," it said, adding that "Zionist domination" of 
the region through pressuring Jordan into signing peace 
agreements with Israel was the objective of the continued 
blockade of al-'Aqabah. 
  The statement, a copy of which was made available to the 
JORDAN TIMES, called on members of the Arab League, the 
Organisation of Islamic Conference, the Non-Aligned Movement and 
African countries to "make their voice heard" in support of the 
Jordanian rejection of the inspections which the parties 
described as piracy. 
  It also warned the United Nations, the Security Council, the 
United States and its allies which are party to the Red Sea 
inspections that the continued siege of al-'Aqabah would on 
"deepen people's hostility." 
  The 10 parties which signed the statement control 20 seats, 
including the 16 of the Islamic Action Front, in the 80-member 
Lower House of Parliament. 
  The signatories to the statement were: the Islamic Action 
Front, the Jordanian People's Democratic Party, the Jordanian 
Socialist Democratic Party, the Jordanian Arab Ba'th Socialist 
Party, the Jordan Arab Democratic Party, the Jordanian Popular 
Unity Party, the Jordanian Progressive Democratic Party, the 
Unionist Arab Democratic Party, the Jordanian People's 
Democratic Unity Party and al-Mustaqbal.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpt] Today, 29 April, here at the Defense Ministry in 
Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for the first time held a 
broad, comprehensive, and detailed discussion on the nature of 
the peace Israel is offering Syria. For the first time, Rabin 
presented the Americans with the details of the three stages of 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights. He did not go into full 
details, but the plan known as Majdal Shams First -- the plan of 
handing the Druze villages over to Syrian control as one of the 
stages of the arrangement -- was definitely mentioned. 
  Remarks of this nature have been made before in very small 
and closed forums, such as Rabin-Clinton or 
Rabin-Peres-Christopher meetings. This time, the remarks were 
made in a very broad forum, which is a message in itself. The 
Golan withdrawal is formally being taken out of the closet. 
  According to the plan Rabin presented, the withdrawal will 
be 
conducted in three stages. The Israeli settlements will be 
removed in the second stage, and the withdrawal will be 
completed in eight years, without specifying the line of 
withdrawal at this time. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus last night and 
presented the Zionist regime's so-called peace plan to him. 
  In this plan, Tel Aviv has proposed to Damascus that the 
Golan Heights be returned to Syria over a period of 10 years and 
in this interim period, U.S. or peacekeeping forces be stationed 
in this region. 
  According to political analysts, this proposal indicates 
that 
the Zionist regime is trying to postpone its withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories to as far in the future as possible, 
by presenting miscellaneous proposals. Earlier as well, the 
Zionist regime had suggested to Syria that it carry out a 
military withdrawal on the condition that Syria would lease the 
region to Israel for 10 years. 
  Such proposals by the Zionist regime to Syria highlight the 
following realities: First, this regime, and its main 
supporter, the United States, do not consider it necessary to 
act within the framework of the Madrid talks. In other words, 
the so-called Middle East peace talks that began in Madrid on 
the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 clearly 
stipulate that the Zionist regime should return the territories 
usurped by it in 1967 to the Arabs. However, in the latest 
proposals by the Zionist regime which have been conveyed by the 
United States to the Syrian leaders, withdrawal from the Syrian 
Golan Heights has been enmeshed in various conditions, some of 
which even violate Syrian sovereignty. 
  The second issue that can be deduced from the Zionist 
regime's proposals to Syria is: With its various ploys, the 
Zionist regime is seeking to defer withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights and other occupied territories to a time as far in the 
future as possible. This attitude indicates that the Zionist 
regime is not very optimistic about its future in the region. 
Tel Aviv is well aware that as a result of the proliferation of 
the wave of Islamism, public opinion in the region has not even 
accepted the despotic Zionist regime's existence, much less 
amicable coexistence with it. 
  The actions by the United States and the Zionist regime to 
cast aside the Madrid framework and Tel Aviv's tendency to 
present such invalid plans for withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
and autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza Strip exposes the 
reality that the Zionist regime and its international supporters 
are striving to attain peace with the Arabs without returning 
the occupied territories to them, but at the same time, to forge 
friendly relations and cooperation in the political, economic, 
and security fields. 
  This reality illustrates the outcome of the so-called peace 
talks, that is, the Zionist regime will get what it set out to 
get from these peace talks, while the Arab countries will be 
forced to make peace with the enemy without regaining their 
usurped territories.

  [Text] Tehran, April 29, IRNA -- When an explosion rocked a 
Maronite church in Beirut on February 27 just after the 
al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre the Western media immediately blamed 
Islamic groups. But the recent arrest of former Lebanese 
Christian warlord Samir Ja'ja' in connection with the church 
blast that killed 11 people dispels the suspicions against 
Islamic groups and brings the culprits to light. It is certain 
that the Zionists instigated the church blast to distract world 
condemnation of the massacre of 60 Palestinians in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in occupied al-Khalil during Ramadan. 
  The leader of the Phalangist party, George Sa'adah, said on 
March 24 that the Christians had to be ashamed of committing 
such a crime against the church. It is, however, quite strange 
that the Western media did not make much noise about the 
perpetrators of this henious crime and did not compete with one 
another to call them terrorists, as it always does with Muslims, 
even if they are not convicted and their responsibility for such 
incidents not proved. 
  When the Zionists announced that the massacre was the act of 
a "mad person," the Western media repeated the version like a 
parrot as a confirmed fact, even before a judicial enquiry was 
conducted. 
  The Zionists announced the same justification when the 
al-'Aqsa Mosque was set on fire in 1967. They claimed that the 
perpetrator, a Canadian Jew, was "mentally deranged," just as 
they did in the case of the American-born Goldstein, the 
murderer of al-Khalil. 
  As a general rule the Western media forgets its reasoning 
power and neutrality when Zionists make any claims, no matter 
how illogical they may be. It tries to promote the false image 
of the Zionist state as the "only democratic state in the Middle 
East," ignoring the fact that it is a state built on terrorism 
and brutal force. Shabra and Shatila, Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, 
al-Khalil are just a few names in the long list of terrorist 
activities perpetrated by the Zionist state. 
  The Beirut church incident is one more example for Muslims 
that the Western media is neither fair nor neutral. It is 
biased against Islam and working hand-in-glove with the 
interests of the Western world.

  [Excerpts] Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of 
the Arab League, yesterday evening held a news conference in 
Tripoli, in which he expressed his happiness at visiting the 
Great Jamahiriyah and his meeting with the brother leader of the 
revolution. He underlined the positive results achieved by this 
visit. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that his visit to the Great 
Jamahiriyah had dealt with the so-called Lockerbie case and the 
recent development that occurred at the meeting of the Arab 
League council, at the level of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo. 
He said: At the council we achieved a unanimous Arab decision 
that the Arab League should put forward an initiative, with the 
accord of member-states, for finding a peaceful settlement of 
this artificial case. He pointed out that the idea of a trial 
at the International Court of Justice in The Hague had won the 
support of the Arab countries. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that 
bringing the suspects before a neutral side accords with the 
requirements of justice and with the discovery of the truth. He 
said further: I have informed the U.S., Britain, and France of 
this decision agreed upon by the Arab League, and I have also 
informed the secretary general of the United Nations and the 
chairman of the Security Council in March. 
  He stressed that there was nothing there to justify a 
rejection by the Western states of this proposal, and he 
underlined in this respect that the position of the Great 
Jamahiriyah was founded on legitimacy and a sound legal basis 
and that we must stick to it, insist on it, and call for its 
implementation. He made clear that this issue was exhaustively 
discussed, and that when he returned to Cairo he would make 
moves in this respect. He said: We will carry on our moves 
together with our eagerness at the same time to stress the 
legitimate nature of the Libyan position and its tallying with 
international law, because the Great Jamahiriyah had tackled 
this crisis with the appropriate legal means. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also said: Right is on our side and we 
must stick to it, insist on it and discuss it, and the coming 
stage will witness a coordination in order to explain the Arab 
viewpoint on this position, which has become an all-Arab 
position and not just that of the Great Jamahiriyah. 
  Concerning the possibility of the Arab states abandoning the 
unjust measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah, particularly 
now that much evidence has emerged that proved that the Great 
Jamahiriyah was innocent of this accusation, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
said: The Arab countries have the power of decision in what they 
do, and he stressed that the decision taken by the recent 
meetings of the Arab League council to back and support the Arab 
Libyan position was now an all-Arab position that must be also 
taken into account by the Western sides. The secretary general 
reiterated the rejection by the Arab League of the unjust 
resolutions, and he underlined that the so-called Security 
Council had double-standards. He said: I have said frankly 
that we did not accept this style and this situation. He said: 
We will strive for a debate on this matter, and we will try all 
possibilities to refute the position of the West in this 
respect, and we will strive to clarify the issue to a number of 
the Security Council member states. This will be done in the 
coming weeks, he said. [passage omitted]

energies and potentials of our people. Here is the text of the 
message of brother Abu-'Ammar: 
  Brother and sister members of the Ramallah Club, honorable 
friends and guests, greetings to you. On the occasion of the 
convening of your conference for this year in Ramallah on the 
soil of our dear homeland, I address my sincerest greetings, my 
congratulations and heartfelt wishes to you all, to the 
honorable friends and guests, and all the sons of our people in 
the homeland and in the diaspora. I wish your conference 
success in its work and I wish it will realize its objectives, 
with the hope that your conference next year will be held on the 
soil of the homeland when the long night of occupation will have 
lifted for our people, who will have gained freedom and 
independence and secured sovereignty over their national 
territory. 
  Your conference is being convened at a time when we are 
close 
to starting to reap the first fruit of the long march of the 
struggle of our people, during which they have made the greatest 
sacrifices. This first fruit is the end of the Israeli 
occupation of dear parts of the territory of our dear homeland 
Palestine in Gaza and Jericho, and the beginning of a new stage 
of struggle which is no less important and difficult, namely the 
stage of edification and construction, the building of 
infrastructure, and the setting up of institutions and bodies in 
order to establish our national authority and entrench its bases 
and foundations as a first step toward the setting up of our 
independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its 
capital. This requires the use and mobilization of all the 
energies and potentials of our people with all seriousness and 
loyalty so as to secure the success of this march and lead it to 
its objective; to work with all objectivity and eagerness in 
order to preserve the national unity of our people; and to 
strengthen and entrench this unity, so that it may be the 
guarantee of our success in building our free, civilized, and 
democratic Palestinian society. 
  Our people are facing a great challenge, and they deserve to 
tackle it, given the glorious history of our people, and given 
their energies, capabilities, and potentials which enable them 
to march toward the future with confident steps to succeed and 
overcome all difficulties, no matter how great, to realize their 
progress and prosperity, to take their proper place among the 
peoples of the world, and to take part in the progress and 
prosperity of the region and in the march of the civilization of 
mankind. 
  I reiterate my greetings to you and I shake your hands. See 
you soon, God willing, in our beloved homeland Palestine, within 
our own independent state, to raise the high and floating 
banners of our people and nation over the churches, mosques, and 
walls of our holy Jerusalem, the capital of our independent 
state, Almighty God willing. It is revolution until victory, 
until our floating banners are raised over Jerusalem, with the 
help of Almighty God.

  [Text] During its meeting held on 1 May, the PLO Executive 
Committee discussed the dangerous situation in Jerusalem. This 
holy city is being exposed to the most serious isolation by the 
occupation authorities with a view to cutting it off from the 
rest of the Palestinian territories and dividing the Palestinian 
land itself. 
  The occupation authorities have taken unprecedented measures 
by depriving the Palestinian nationals of their natural right to 
enter the city of Jerusalem, including the right to visit holy 
Islamic and Christian sites to perform their rites. 
  These authorities have gone so far as to violate the most 
basic rights and human values, including the right to life. 
They are preventing doctors, teachers, and employees from 
working in the city in their hospitals, schools, and other jobs. 
They are also preventing students living outside the city from 
going to school. They are preventing women, families, and 
couples, some of whom live in the city and others outside it, 
from being together. 
  Discrimination, oppression, and violation of human rights 
are 
taking place while the Israeli Government is claiming that it 
intends to start a new page in its relationship with the 
Palestinian people. However, these measures and this harassment 
have become more vicious over the past few days under the guise 
of steps aimed at preparing for the signing of the first 
practical Palestinian- Israeli peace accord. 
  The PLO regards the encirclement, isolation, repressive 
measures, and continuing settlement in Jerusalem and its suburbs 
as incompatible with the essence, the foundations, and the texts 
of the peace accord, including Israel's commitment through the 
exchange of letters not to touch Jerusalem and its civilian and 
religious institutions and the rights of Palestinian nationals 
in general. 
  The PLO stresses that these Israeli measures will eventually 
undermine the peace moves because Jerusalem's future is a basic 
element in the peace process. The PLO also calls on the Arab 
and Islamic states to adopt a firm position toward the danger 
that is threatening the future of holy Jerusalem and its 
steadfast population, especially when Israel is calling for, 
under the guise of the peace process, moves toward the 
normalization of relations and the lifting of the economic 
boycott. It is doing this while it is continuing its dangerous 
measures to determine the future of holy Jerusalem by imposing a 
fait accompli. 
  The PLO holds the cosponsors and the states contributing to 
the peace process, particularly Russia, the United States, and 
the European Community, responsible for this dangerous situation 
and its effect on the future of the entire peace process. The 
PLO will take a series of measures to protect the future of the 
holy city and the population living there and the inalienable 
rights of our people in the city. These rights have been 
stressed by all of the resolutions of international legitimacy.

  [Excerpt] Amman -- Fatah Central Committee member Hani 
al-Hasan has called for the establishment of a 
Jordanian-Palestinian popular front formed from the popular 
political bodies, forces, and personalities in order to contain 
the dangers of the Oslo Gaza-Jericho First agreement and to 
develop a common understanding among all the influential forces 
in the society. 
  Addressing a symposium organized by the International and 
Islamic Studies and Information Center, moderated by Bilal 
al-Tall, head of the center, in the presence of the secretaries 
general of the parties, al-Hasan added: We are on the threshold 
of a new and serious stage, especially since it was agreed in 
Bucharest that meetings would begin on 3 May and that an 
agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides would be 
signed on 5 May regardless of the outstanding problems. The 
signing will be accompanied by the entry into Gaza and Jericho 
of a 6,000-strong Palestinian police force and 500 civilians who 
will work in various departments. Al-Hasan described the entry 
of the Palestinian police force as a fireworks display. 
  He called for concentrated efforts during the next phase to 
confront and find an alternative to the Israeli strategy, 
especially since Israel is currently undergoing political, 
security, and economic difficulties. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Nasr Yusuf, Palestinian police </F>
chief, by unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not 
given--first two paragraphs are AL-MAJALLAH introduction] 
  [Text] While Palestinian-Israeli negotiations continue in 
Cairo in an effort to solve disputes, preparatory to the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Palestinian 
police forces have completed their preparations and training as 
they await the handover of the security of those areas after the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces. 
  In an effort to find out more about the Palestinian security 
arrangements in Gaza and Jericho, and the mission of the 
Palestinian police, AL-MAJALLAH conducted this interview with 
Major General Nasr Yusuf, chief of the Palestinian Police Force, 
who also took part in the negotiations with the Israelis. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What are the security arrangements being 
adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Gaza and 
Jericho after the signing of the agreement? 
  [Yusuf] For our part, all measures and all preparations have 
been made for complete control of security conditions. There is 
a precise plan, already adopted, to fill the security vacuum 
that will occur in the regions as soon as the Israeli forces 
withdraw, and to prevent any chaos or tension. The Palestinian 
deployment forces have been instructed to carry out their duties 
immediately. All that remains is that we be permitted to enter 
the areas. This is at the core of the present dispute in the 
negotiations with the Israelis. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] How many Palestinian policemen have you and 
the 
Israelis agreed to deploy to undertake law and order duties in 
Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Yusuf] That step is still the subject of dispute between us 
and the Israelis. The Israelis have not set the final number. 
Every time they agree with us on specific numbers, they back 
away from that commitment. For our part, we attach importance 
only to the numbers that will be agreed upon inside the 
negotiation chambers. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Have the Palestinian security cadres 
responsible for intelligence and the protection of senior 
Palestinian commanders in Gaza and Jericho--such as President 
Yasir 'Arafat and his top aides--now actually been formed? 
  [Yusuf] Yes. This matter was concluded finally, and all the 
special forces for these objectives have been assembled. The 
security forces working with intelligence have been appointed 
and equipped. Their mission, the areas of their deployment, the 
format for their cooperation with intelligence--domestically and 
abroad, with the Arab and European states cooperating with the 
Palestinian autonomous authority--have all been defined. The 
same is the case with the forces that will guard and protect 
senior PLO commanders, the officials of the Palestinian 
authority in Jericho, and all the members of civil defense 
forces, the central security forces, bodyguards, and others. The 
areas of their deployment have already been set out on maps, and 
the mode of cooperation among them has been defined as well. All 
that remains is for them to be permitted to enter the Gaza and 
Jericho areas to take over their total responsibility on the 
ground. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What about the agreement on protecting 
crossing 
points? Is it true that Israel will have complete control, while 
the Palestinians will merely be permitted to monitor from a 
distance inside rooms of their own? 
  [Yusuf] I don't think this is true. We will not consent to 
any such arrangements; we will have a permanent and effective 
presence. We will have many specialized tasks and duties, just 
like the Israelis, only more. In any case, we won't be able to 
say anything about this issue until after the final signature of 
the agreement and the natural conclusion of the matter through 
the actual deployment at the crossing points. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What about the agreement on the weapons the 
Palestinian police will use? 
  [Yusuf] This question is linked to the first one. The 
Israelis say they will be light arms. We are asking to use the 
arms and equipment that any police force in the world would use, 
in order to enforce law and order in the areas subject to 
Palestinian control. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Why was the dispatch of the first contingent 
of 
the Palestinian police force to Gaza and Jericho cancelled? 
  [Yusuf] The delay was not from our side, of course, but the 
Israelis are being asked about it. After we made all the 
preparations, at the last minute we were told of the 
postponement of the sending of the first batch, which should 
have preceded the greater number of police forces. The same is 
true of the team of Palestinian observers. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What will be the nature of the security 
cooperation between you and the Israeli security forces deployed 
in Gaza and Jericho to protect the Israeli settlements? 
  [Yusuf] There should be a supreme coordinating committee 
between the two sides to oversee this. But so far this committee 
has not been formed, and we have not been informed of the names 
of the Israeli participants. We are still waiting for a solution 
to major issues pending between us and the other side.

<F P=106> [Interview with Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, "vehement critic of </F>
PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat," by an unidentified DER SPIEGEL 
correspondent; place and date not given: "We Will Be the 
Losers"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Is the signing of the autonomy 
agreement for Gaza and the region of Jericho the beginning of a 
more peaceful era in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Quite certainly not. The people here are 
tired, frustrated, and disappointed. In addition, because of 
the latest cordoning off of the occupied territories, they are 
ruined economically. We are looking into the future with 
anxious expectation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Where does this pessimism come from? After 
all, the Palestinians now have the opportunity to shape their 
lives themselves. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] There is no reason for euphoria. Since the 
conclusion of the Oslo agreement, the PLO, Israel, and also the 
United States, the main sponsor of the peace process, have 
succumbed to a collective self-deception. We must shake them 
awake: Open your eyes; this agreement will not make peace, 
because the most basic Palestinian demands remain unfulfilled -- 
putting an end to Israel's illegal claim to the occupied 
territories. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Instead of a lasting peace you see the 
agreement only as a short-lived cease-fire? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I am afraid we will see a repetition of the 
past: a bloody confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Even though the leader of the Palestinians, 
Yasir 'Arafat, supports the agreement? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] This makes it even worse. With his 
signature under the new agreement he only legitimizes the so-far 
illegal claim of the Israeli occupation power. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But 'Arafat is praising the autonomy agreement 
as the first step toward a new Palestine. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Pure delusion. Already with the skeleton 
agreement the PLO leadership tacitly accepted the more than 140 
Jewish settlements in Gaza and in the West Bank within the 
occupied territories as independent legal and administrative 
units -- answerable only to the Israeli authorities. This is 
practically an annexation. There will be two kinds of law, just 
as during the colonial time -- and this means specifically: An 
Israeli who steals a car in Gaza is put on trial in Tel Aviv. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The agreement applies to only the five-year 
transition period for the time being, not to the final status of 
the occupied territories. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Nevertheless, the transition agreement is 
fateful, because, in the meantime, the Israelis continue 
building their settlements and establish new facts with that. 
Even the withdrawal of the Israeli Army is, in reality, only a 
transfer of the armed forces behind the fences of the 
settlements, where Israelis live like in territorial military 
villages. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Not even 5,000 Israelis among almost 1 million 
Palestinians: In particular in Gaza it is already foreseeable 
that the settlers will not stay forever. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] It may be that they will withdraw from Gaza 
and that they want to use the settlements there only as a point 
of negotiations in the discussions about contentious issues -- 
such as the status of Jerusalem. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has 
already announced that he also wants to tear down settlements in 
return for peace. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Perhaps he will close one settlement or the 
other, because the financial expenditures is out of proportion 
to the military and strategic benefit. However, this does not 
mean any basic readiness to abolish the Jewish enclaves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, time is working against the 
Palestinians. Can you afford at all to refuse the current offer 
of peace? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] In view of the quarrels and infighting among 
us Palestinians, we will be the losers given if the Israelis 
present us with an independent state on a silver platter. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You think that internal reforms of the PLO are 
more urgent than the peace package? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Regardless of the question of whether we are 
for or against the agreement, we must finally put the 
Palestinian house in order. We want to build a better future 
here. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This is precisely what 'Arafat is saying. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] But he is not doing anything for it. So 
far, at least, he has not committed himself to democratic rules. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And this is how he will rule in Gaza and 
Jericho? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I hope that in the personnel decisions 
'Arafat will not sacrifice the necessary competence to the 
various cliques or his personal preference. We will not permit 
such nepotism, the people wil rebel against him. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Within months after the return of the PLO, the 
Palestinians are to vote on their leadership in free elections. 
Will you run against 'Arafat on your own ticket? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] It is too early to say that, but I do not 
want to rule out that I will be a candidate -- either as an 
individual or on a ticket together with other independent 
politicians.

  [Text] Damascus -- AL-MAJD has learned that a sharp 
dispute has developed within the ranks of the alliance of the 10 
Palestinian factions opposed to the peace process. 
  Informed Palestinian sources in Damascus say the old-new 
dispute between the Hamas movement and the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has recently resurfaced 
following press statements last week attributed to Dr. Musa 
Abu-Marzuq, chief of the Political Bureau of Hamas. 
  The sources say the 10 factions are divided over the 
statements, which Hamas quickly explained, dismissing the bulk 
of these statements in another statement issued by its bureau in 
the Syrian capital. 
  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has 
largely supported the DFLP's criticism of Abu-Marzuq's 
statements, while the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has supported Hamas' recent 
explanation of the statements. Fatah-the Uprising, the 
al-Sa'iqah Organization, the Islamic Jihad Organization, and the 
Revolutionary Communist Party have exerted intensive efforts to 
contain this secondary dispute between the parties of the 
alliance of opposition factions and to refocus attention on the 
basic contradiction between the opposition's line and the 
approach of capitulation and its consequent destructive 
'Arafatist agreements with the Zionist enemy.

  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], Jordan region, has issued a 
statement in which it responded to a previous statement issued 
by one of the fronts' leaders in Amman, Mustafa Khamis, 
announcing his split from the front. The front's statement 
says: We pity and feel deep sorrow for our brother and comrade, 
Mustafa, because of his recent psychological and nervous 
deterioration. Therefore, we attach no importance whatsoever to 
the contents of that statement, the whole issue is considered an 
idle talk and an object of mockery. 
  Despite this, the lengthy statement says that Khamis suffers 
from a superiority complex and psychological trouble, and that 
this was caused when he was arrested in 1967 by the Zionist 
enemy and was exposed, like other strugglers, to brutal torture, 
which he could not stand because of its fierceness and his weak 
metal state. 
  The front says that Khamis rejected the logic of financial 
rationing and accountability and insisted on improvised and 
secret accounts. 
  Concluding, the statement says that all this expresses an 
incoherent personality and deep changes in his awareness and 
behavior. The front's statement, however, asserts that brother 
Mustafa was one of the nationalists of whom the front was proud.

agreement on the implementation of the so-called self-rule is 
achieved at the expense of our people and their objectives. 
  We realize Nabil Sha'th's need to expedite the achievement 
of 
his dream so that the doors will open to his political 
consultations and his trade companies for his sons and relatives 
so that they can enter the territories that have been forbidden 
to them and so that they can inherit the companies, 
institutions, calculators, and typewriters of the coming 
authority. But, we wanted Nabil Sha'th and his group to visit, 
instead, one of the Zionist barriers that prevent our people 
from reaching the al-Aqsa Mosque to perform their prayers and 
from reaching the markets so that the defenseless citizens will 
be able to buy even some of their necessities and find some food 
for their children. 
  Our correspondents from the West Bank and Gaza Strip report: 
We wanted Nabil Sha'th to see al-Malha market, which was built 
by the Zionist enemy, so that he could see how the operation of 
stabbing two Zionist soldiers yesterday has shown the 
ineffectiveness of the Zionist siege on Jerusalem and its 
suburbs. 
  We wanted Sha'th to come to Ya'bad and Barta'ah to see how 
the soldiers of terrorist Rabin raid our people's homes and 
wreak havoc and destruction inside them. But, Sha'th insists on 
staying in Cairo. From there, he can emerge from his seclusion, 
which has lasted more than 24 hours, to stand in front of 
cameras and television screens and announce that an agreement 
has been reached, which he has announced dozens of times. He 
insists on staying in Cairo so that he can meet with Shulamit 
Aloni, the Zionist minister who has bragged in front of many 
Arabs that the doors of the entire world are now open to the 
Zionist entity. 
  Sha'th insists on seclusion until the signing of the 
agreement but, of course, he does not hesitate to receive the 
raven, the godfather [al-ghurab al-'arrab], Christopher, after 
his U.S.-Zionist administration granted the so-called self-rule 
policemen cars to be used to protect the Zionist settlers in 
Gaza and Jericho and to repress our people who stress their 
rejection of the accord of disgrace and treason. 
  What really counts is not seclusion but the continued heroic 
actions, like yesterday, which was known as the day of knife war. 
  As we wait for the results of the open session, until the 
'Arafat-Zionist agreement is signed, and for the results of 
Christopher's tour of the region, Zionist terrorism against our 
people continues, far from the atmosphere of Sha'th's optimism. 
Moreover, land confiscation continues in order to open more 
settlement roads and to displace our people. 
  Within this context, terrorist (Gabriash 'Ahahl), the 
so-called security officer in the settlement council in Hebron, 
warned about another massacre similar to the holy al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre. It should also be noted that the head of the 
settlements council in Qiryat Arba' earlier made threats before 
the Zionist committee investigating the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre that a new massacre would be perpetrated in Hebron by a 
settler using a machine gun against the Arabs. 
  Our kinsfolk in Hebron, who are facing this Zionist threat 
with more patience and giving, refuted the military spokesman's 
claims that martyr al-Waridat tried to stab a Zionist soldier. 
Citing eyewitnesses, the Zionist newspaper THE JERUSALEM POST 
affirms that these claims are false. The paper notes that these 
claims are false and that the criminal soldier had been known to 
be carrying out repressive and barbaric acts against the 
citizens in Hebron for weeks. 
  At the end of their news report, our correspondents warned 
against Zionist deception in light of this game of distracting 
the attention of the Palestinians by preoccupying them with the 
issue of redeploying Rabin's soldiers in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. It has also been noted that the Zionists are taking 
advantage of certain gaps in our people's ranks, created by 
'Arafat's supporters, in order to strike at their unity and 
undermine their efforts through secondary issues which, as 
everyone knows, are nothing more than a cheap Zionist bribe to 
the pro-'Arafat delegation in order to peddle the accord of 
treason. 
  Moreover, the our correspondents warned against these 
meetings that some Palestinian opposition members are holding 
with representatives of the Zionist Israeli military command, 
which is not seeking their opinion on the Muslims' position on 
the Oslo accord inasmuch as they are seeking to drive a wedged 
into the Palestinian ranks and to break their solidarity for 
refusing to deal with the Zionists.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Regarding ways to tackle the 
security situation in the country, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi 
said that the government was committed to adopt a firm method, 
as the head of state, Liamine Zeroual, recently declared in this 
respect. He added that an absolute priority had been given to 
the improvement of the security situation and the protection of 
people and property. The prime minister further said that the 
relentless efforts of the security forces, the improvement of 
living conditions for the citizens, the fight against 
unemployment, the protection of the workers' purchasing power, 
and the strengthening of the local authorities together 
constitute activities aimed at guaranteeing a better security 
situation. 
  On ways to bring the security situation under control, the 
prime minister believes that for the Algerians who are concerned 
about the country's future, who respect the constitution and the 
laws of the Republic, and who work for the nation's highest 
interest, dialogue seems natural and necessary, and allowing the 
expression of various viewpoints is a democratic act and is 
evidence of civilization, as the prime minister put it.

  [Text] Athens, May 2, IRNA -- Two recently released leaders 
of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Algeria have expressed 
hope that those who have usurped power will soon be removed and 
an Islamic state established in Algeria. "The people's wish 
shall bring back the power to their hands and it shall lead - 
God willing - to the isolation and downfall of those whose 
desire and hatred prevented an agreement with the people," said 
Abdul Qadir Boukhamkhem and Ali Jiddi in an interview with Arab 
weekly paper AL- MUSLIMUN. They pointed out that for the first 
time after the liberation of Algeria from French colonialism the 
country was on the verge of becoming an Islamic state when the 
military-backed regime robbed power by force and banned FIS. 
  "A group inimical to Islam, holding power behind the 
curtian, 
prevented the Islamic solution and oppressed the will of the 
people and opened the country to the French and western cultural 
and economic invasion," noted the two FIS leaders. They called 
for immediate release of all Islamic prisoners and the lifting 
of the ban on FIS. 
  Last month the head of the regime, Liamine Zeroual, replaced 
his prime minister Redha Malek with a technocrat, Mokdad Sifi 
seen as an attempt to pursue talks with FIS. 
  "The downfall of Malek gives some hope... if it was a real 
beginning to put an end to those calling for the destruction of 
Islam and Arabism," they told the newspaper published from 
Jeddah. 
  "The men of the Islamic Salvation Front do not lack the 
preparedness and the ability to contribute, as expected from 
them, for a just and legal reform in the country," they 
stressed. They revealed that communists and secularists in the 
ruling clique had created a "death squad" to carry out attacks 
and killings in the country to terrorize the people.

<F P=106> [Speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in </F>
Tarhunah on 1 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Brothers, in another outburst of 
anger against the challenges of the forces of colonialism and 
hegemony to the Arab Libyan people and the Arab nation, and in 
another festival of defiance, the masses of Tarhunah today took 
to the streets to welcome the brother leader of the revolution 
and to fuse together in him. They strongly shouted that the 
voice of this free and sovereign people over its land is 
stronger than the embargo and the voice of the crusader war 
drums. 
  Amid the masses, the brother leader of the revolution 
delivered this speech: 
  Brothers, when the drums of confrontation beat, Tarhunah, 
which history knows very well, will not hesitate to stand in the 
front line to face challenge with challenge. 
  Brothers, at the moment in which the camp of enemies is 
trying to impose defeat on the Arab nation and trying to 
humiliate this great nation before the world, at this moment the 
masses of struggling Tarhunah come out to declare to the world 
that in this place humiliation cannot pass. From this place we 
challenge insolence and arrogance. From this place we declare 
the will of defiance; declare the will of confrontation; and 
declare our readiness to face up to the enemies unintimidated by 
their fleets, their forces, or their might. The will of the 
peoples is stronger than the armies of enemies and the 
aggressors. [passage omitted] 
  Tarhunah became the center of the resistance to Italy and 
the 
base of the counteroffensive against Italian colonialism. 
  Tarhunah became the strategic target for the colonialist 
operation in the Italian fascist ugly era. They moved their 
armies from Gharyan, from al-Aziziyah, and from Tajura in order 
to attack Tarhunah from all directions. [passage omitted] 
  After these villains took over the other resistance centers 
their aim and concern was to subjugate Tarhunah and bring it 
under control. [passage omitted] Today, brothers, history is 
repeating itself: the United States is raising the crusade 
banner, and the western Christian forces are allying themselves 
with it in a modern neo-crusade aimed at mosques, at burning the 
Koran once again, and at taking over Mecca and Medina, which are 
now considered as taken over de facto. Most regrettably, the 
decision of the Christian states, made at what is called the 
Security Council, has been implemented against holy Mecca. The 
strugglers, the Libyan revolutionaries, have been prevented from 
performing the pilgrimage because the decision of the Christian 
states -- America, Britain, and France -- has been carried out 
against Mecca. We are playing a part in another historic epic 
poem, and God wants to prescribe for us honor, glory, and 
martyrdom as He did for our fathers and ancestors. 
  We will be lucky brothers if we enter more modern battles 
against America, Britain, and France. Our dead will be in 
heaven and their dead in hell. We will gain glory and leave an 
honorable history for our children and grandchildren just as our 
fathers and ancestors left this shining history. [passage 
omitted] 
  Tomorrow and after tomorrow, brothers, history will curse 
America, Britain, France, and the Western Christian bloc and 
will glorify us. History will record sacrifice and glory for us 
and shame and disgrace for the states of arrogance. 
  Brothers, we are resurrecting our history anew because these 
hours are the hours of taking along provisions from the history 
of our fathers and forefathers who were not living in luxury or 
greedy. 
  Brothers, we are reviving our history, because these hours 
are hours where we get inspiration from the history of our 
fathers and ancestors who were not prodigal, rich, or greedy. 
[passage omitted] 
  The weapons of confrontation are industrialization, farming, 
knowledge, defiance, and austerity. These are the weapons with 
which we confront the enemy. We should have a full awareness of 
the new international politics meant to bring about a 
neo-colonial domination of Christian Europe over the 
Arab-Islamic world. They want to destroy mosques once again, 
they want to burn the Koran, Koran books once again, they want 
us to live as their subjects once again. Never! These evil 
objectives will never be realized; they will never be able to 
achieve what they want. Here are the aware masses, the free 
masses, the [word indistinct] masses that can instill life in 
the dead and lift the morale of the humiliated Arab nation. 
  We send our backing and support to the fighters of the 
Lebanese people who launch daring attacks and are unafraid of 
the threats of America, Britain, France, and Europe. So that 
despicable Zionism will understand, they launch daring attacks 
on the north of Palestine and we say to them that these attacks 
open the door for the great conquest, the liberation of the land 
from the south to the south [as heard]. These attacks must not 
stop, must not stop in southern Lebanon as far as the south of 
occupied Palestine. 
  O brothers, we will not be satisfied that the soil of Egypt 
and Jordan should be isolated from each other with the enemy 
dividing them, the enemy who is occupying Umm al-Rashrash which 
the Israelis called Elat. This is Egyptian land 100 percent. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Israeli occupation of Umm al-Rashrash prevented even 
pilgrims from going to Mecca in cars, on camels, or on foot. 
When pilgrims go from Egypt to Saudi Arabia, how will they get 
through? From which place will they get through? They cannot 
get through, O brothers, by land, because the land between 
Jordan and Egypt is occupied. Egyptian Umm al-Rashrash is 
occupied. It is a disgrace, O brothers, that Umm al-Rashrash 
should be occupied. It is a disgrace that the Arab homeland 
should be divided on land between Jordan and Egypt. The battle 
will be for the liberation of Umm al- Rashrash. The 
revolutionaries of Egypt, of Jordan, or the Arab Peninsula are 
faced with the task of the liberation of Umm al- Rashrash so 
that the Egyptian land may find itself in contact with the 
Jordanian land through Ummm al-Rashrash. This is the coming 
battle. The first battle toward which the Islamic world must 
move is the liberation of Umm al-Rashrash. Egyptian Umm 
al-Rashrash is an extremely important strategic area. It has 
divided the Arab homeland, broken the spine of the Arab nation, 
prevented the pilgrims of the Arab Maghreb from going to Mecca. 
You cannot pass from Egypt to Jordan because Umm al-Rashrash is 
occupied, brothers. This is not Palestine, not occupied 
Palestine. Egyptian Umm al- Rashrash is occupied. 
  When they ask Syria to recognize Israel in return for a 
withdrawal from the Golan, it is a great encroachment, a great 
humiliation, brothers. Syria has the right to recover the Golan 
Heights in acordance with the UN charter, without any condition. 
The Israelis must withdraw from the Golan without any condition 
or negotiations. The Golan is an occupied Syrian land. The UN 
charter says that land must not be taken by force. Why, 
brothers, are they trampling the UN charter underfoot? They are 
trampling international law underfoot and asking Syria to 
recognize Israel so as to humiliate it, to belittle it, to 
tarnish its history of struggle, and to humiliate the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party at pan-Arab and international levels. 
They want to humiliate the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. They 
want to inflict humiliation on the history of the 'Umayyids 
[dynasty of caliphs who had Damascus as capital] and the history 
of Khalid Ibn-al-Walid [Arab army commander who conquered Syria 
and the Levant]. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, they want Libya to rcognize Israel so as to solve 
the problem of Lockerbie with her. To hell and 1,000 times to 
hell if that is the condition. Never and never, this condition 
will never be realized. Libya will fight until doomsday. Libya 
knows through her historic awareness and her rich history that 
the road to her security in the future, to which she is forging 
ahead, is fraught with sweat, blood, and sacrifices. However, 
it is the only road and there is no alternative to it to reach 
an honorable and free tomorrow. 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] O brothers, they lie and 
cheat, they say that Libya brought down the Pan Am plane and 
that this is the problem. So there they are behind the scenes 
saying ...[changes thought]... this is not the problem. The 
problem is that Libya is called upon to recognize Israel. Look 
at this injustice. They want us to recognize that white is 
black and that black is white. Why should we be forced into 
recognition? Death is easier than recognition, easier than 
recognition by injustice, by falsification. We do not recognize 
falsification. Palestine ...[changes thought]... the 
Palestinian people, Palestine is an occupied Arab territory. 
[passage omitted] 
  We support the Jews so that they live in their homelands and 
are respected, so that persecution is lifted on them, including 
the Jews from the Arab world. They must return to their 
countries and Palestine must be left to the Palestinians. We 
challenge them to return the Palestinian people to Palestine. We 
challenge them to carry out free elections with the Palestinian 
people's presence and under the supervision of the so-called 
United Nations, as is the case now in South Africa. We 
challenge them to show they want peace. We are the ones who 
call for this solution and we are the ones who want and love 
peace. When we are forced to fight, we will fight with 
fierceness and madness because we will be forced to fight, 
whereas they are cowards who look for fighting for prosperity 
and when the time of confrontation comes, they will run away 
like dogs just like Italy ran away from this place, this sacred 
place. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Khartoum, 1 May (SUNA) -- Talks between Sudan and an 
IMF delegation, led by the director of the fund's Middle East 
department, which arrived in Khartoum last Friday [29 April], 
ended this afternoon. 
  Finance Minister Abdullahi Hasan Ahmad, in a statement to 
SUNA, said that the two-day talks discussed steps and proposals 
to normalize Sudanese relations with the IMF. He said that 
Sudan made proposals to the delegation which, if accepted, would 
probably result in the sending of another IMF mission around the 
end of this month. That delegation would discuss elements of an 
agreement on which the fund's governing council would base its 
report, concerning its dealings with Sudan, during its June 
meeting. 
  The minister described this round of the talks as fruitful, 
and said that agreement was reached on the delegation's 
proposals concerning dealings with Sudan, which would be 
conveyed to the governing council. 
  Sudan's delegation to this round of talks was headed by the 
finance minister. Today the delegation met Dr. Muhammad Khayr 
al- Zubayr, the minister of state for planning, and Dr. Sabir 
Muhammad al-Hasan, the governor of the Bank of Sudan. 
  The IMF had resolved to compel Sudan to a forced withdrawal 
from the organization last February, on grounds that it had not 
settled its debt, which amounts to half a billion dollars.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article from the "Brothers" page] </F>
  [Text] Daniel Akodi [name as transliterated], 
representative of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement 
[SPLM] in the Middle East, has stressed that the congress that 
the SPLM recently held in south Sudan discussed 23 papers on the 
future situation in the south and what the SPLM should do about 
it. He noted that ad hoc committees have been formed to discuss 
these papers and work out their final views on how to administer 
the liberated areas in the south. 
  In an exclusive statement to the "Brothers," (Akodi) pointed 
out that the SPLM believes that since it controls large areas in 
southern Sudan, the al-Nubah mountains, and (al-Anqasta), it 
must increase its attention to the infrastructure in these 
areas. He said: As events developed, the SPLM thought that 
there was a need to establish a civil administration with 
organizations from the bottom to the top at the level of 
villages, groups of villages, and larger areas. A national 
council will supervise all these areas. At the same time, the 
SPLM seeks to marshal the masses in the south so that they can 
confront the challenges facing them. On the military level, 
agreement was reached to form a military council to formulate 
military strategy. These are the issues that were discussed at 
the SPLM congress. He added: We in the SPLM did not at all 
mean these measures to mean that we are seceding, as several 
Arab papers reported. 
  Regarding reports in the Sudanese regime's newspapers' that 
these measures were merely designed to cover up the SPLM's 
military defeats, Akodi said: Quite the contrary. The Sudanese 
Government did not score any important military victories during 
the dry season. The SPLM is now trying suicidal operations, 
having massed all its forces in the south in an attempt to 
tighten its control on the Nimule area, where pitched battles 
are raging. I believe that the ruling regime in Khartoum has 
completely failed to achieve any of its military goals, despite 
massing huge forces unprecedented in size since the civil war 
started in Sudan. This confirms that the regime's newspaper 
reports are false. The government forces failed to score any 
military victories. As a matter of fact, the SPLM has military 
resources to strike at the heart of the government forces. We 
are currently planning such moves. 
  Regarding the term "New Sudan," which appeared in the 
communique released by the SPLM congress and which makes the 
opposition in the north fear that the SPLM is splitting away 
from the grouping under a new name, Akodi said: We in the SPLM 
are concerned about the grouping; our relations with the 
opposition forces in the north are very good. All that we mean 
by "New Sudan" is a Sudan based on new foundations and new 
concepts that will guarantee personal freedom to the citizens 
regardless of religion, race, ethnic affiliation, sex, or color. 
  Akodi continued: We in the northern and southern opposition 
groups agree on all the basics. The movement, which has been 
fighting since the time of al-Numayri's, Siwar al-Dhahab, 
through the party government that involved Umma, the Democratic 
Unionist Party, and the Sudanese People's Federal Party, has 
opted to join the alliance embracing these parties due to its 
firm belief that major northern parties have basically changed 
their position on the issue of southern Sudan. We all have a 
clear vision of how to build a secularist, democratic, united, 
new Sudan. We in the people's movement have no disputes or 
disagreements concerning the objectives of the National 
Democratic Grouping [NDG] in the north. There is full harmony 
among us and we have a clear collective vision of Sudan's future 
after the fall of the National Islamic Front [NIF]. 
  Akodi added: It is absolutely wrong to view the measures the 
movement adopted recently as a step toward breaking away. The 
movement absolutely believes that if the NIS regime falls, all 
democratic powers in Sudan will sit together to plan the 
country's political future. When this happens, everybody will 
eventually agree on how to achieve peaceful coexistence between 
the north and south after 28 years of civil war. 
  Hence, he added, what the press said does not mean that the 
movement has drifted away from the basic principles of the NDG 
charters it signed. 
  Asked whether the SPLM is seeking military support from 
northern elements in the NDG, Akodi said: We believe that all 
the NDG factions should join efforts to overthrow the ruling 
regime. This does not necessarily mean that all northern groups 
must undertake military action within the ranks of the SPLM. We 
believe that these elements can undertake a massive media 
campaign and urge and mobilize the northern masses to speed up 
the overthrow of the NIS. This is what both the north and south 
have agreed on in the NDG. 
  As a military power, we do our duty in this connection. 
However, we do not object to northern military action if this 
is possible, even if it is on a small scale. This would give 
the southerners a big incentive to reaffirm their national 
affiliation.

<F P=106> [Interview with al-Tijani al-Tayyib, secretary general of </F>
the Sudanese Communist Party, SCP, by an unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-WAFD] We would like to know your views on the 
differences the press reported recently among the factions of 
the National Democratic Grouping [NDG]? 
  [Al-Tijani] In fact we just had normal differences. We did 
not want them to be publicized by the press. We in the Sudanese 
Communist Party [SCP] have nothing to say to the press on the 
difference of views among the NDG factions. However, I am 
willing to explain some facts if you ask me about them. 
  [AL-WAFD] Ummah Party says that the NDG's higher 
coordination 
committee is controlled by the left and that it is not an 
effective democratic instrument that enlivens the opposition's 
and the NDG's performance. 
  [Al-Tijani] I believe that it is unthinkable to accuse the 
SCP of controlling the NDG's coordination committee, which 
includes representatives from Ummah Party, the Democratic 
Unionist Party [DUP], the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement 
[SPLM], the legitimate command of the armed forces, Southern 
Sudan Political Association [SSPA], and the Sudanese National 
Party [SNP], in addition to other independent figures. Accusing 
the left or any other party of controlling the committee would 
be an underestimation of all these partisan bodies. All these 
parties are independent and control their own decisions; they 
make the decisions they believe serve their interests and views 
as well as the interests of the Sudanese people and the 
collective struggle to overthrow the National Islamic Front 
[NIS] regime. How then can we conceive of the left, represented 
by one party, the SCP, as controlling all the other parties that 
are represented in the coordination committee? The SCP does not 
have the necessary enormous funds, does not have many masses--as 
Ummah Party puts it--and does not have the military power. 
Hence, the allegation that it controls the committee is 
inconsistent with reality. The SCP cannot afford to dictate any 
decision to the legitimate leadership. The same thing applies 
to the DUP, the SPLM, and all the rest. 
  [AL-WAFD] Last week the Ummah Party put forward an 
integrated 
plan to restructure and reorganize the NDG and the coordination 
committee. What do you think of that plan? 
  [Al-Tijani] No one denies the need to structure the NDG. The 
issue has been under consideration since 1991 and it is being 
discussed at every single NDG meeting. The Ummah Party did not 
put forward any plans in this connection until last April, and 
their plan was not complete. However, we believe that this 
issue will not benefit the Sudanese struggle if it is published 
in the press. The public who read the press cannot alter the 
problem, unless they stage demonstrations in front of party 
headquarters. But that is impossible in view of the conditions 
Sudanese opposition activity experiences at present. Hence, it 
would have been better to discuss these issues among the parties 
to reach a final decision that all the parties concerned approve 
in a democratic manner. 
  As matter of fact, a committee that was formed in the NDG 
discussed a large number of proposals put forward by all 
political forces. The committee worked out recommendations and 
forwarded them to the NDG and the coordination committee to be 
decided on at the NDG's 5th congress. There is no disagreement 
on the need to restructure the NDG. We, as a Communist Party, 
put forward a plan to the coordination committee along with the 
plans submitted by the other parties. The fact that the 
coordination committee has failed to resolve this issue since 
September 1991 shows that this problem may be "lopsided"--that 
is, this structure may favor a certain policy. If there is no 
clear policy, it is difficult to imagine the structure. The 
election of the coordination committee chairman or secretary 
general, for example, and the formation of ad hoc committees 
should be preceded by outlines of the usefulness and political 
tasks of these new bodies. There should be an agreement among 
all parties on the policies that these bodies will follow. 
Conversely, the parties may decide to restructure the NDG first 
and then agree on the political tasks. This is no problem. 
What counts is that the structuring should be linked to the 
policies that the NDG is supposed to follow. We, as a Communist 
Party, have no objections to any restructuring of the NDG on 
which the parties agree. We make no conditions other than 
regarding the persons who will fill the posts. 
  [AL-WAFD] What do you mean by "conditions" about persons. Do 
you mean that you are opposed to certain persons? 
  [Al-Tijani] We are not opposed to certain names or persons, 
but we have legitimate questions about the "president" and the 
qualifications he must meet. I believe that we should reach an 
agreement in advance on the president or secretary general, 
whoever they may be. 
  [AL-WAFD] From the political point of view, how would you 
explain the reasons the Ummah Party raised the issue of 
"restructuring the NDG" at this time? 
  [Al-Tijani] We believe that this issue should not be 
discussed in the newspapers. The person who first raised this 
issue in the newspapers should bear the responsibility. I do 
not believe that any political forces anywhere in the world 
would broach such a sensitive and serious issue in the 
newspapers. We, as the Sudanese opposition, are members of one 
committee and one grouping. We all agree on the need to solve 
the issue of restructuring the NDG. I believe that raising the 
issue in the newspapers is not in the interest of the NDG nor 
will it help solve the issue of restructuring. 
  [AL-WAFD] Now that the SPLM has declared a "New Sudan" in 
the 
south, how does the Communist Party view the significance of 
this declaration? What about the SPLM's continued membership in 
the NDG, particularly since certain people interpret the 
declaration as being tantamount to the secession of southern 
Sudan? 
  [Al-Tijani] First, as far as we know, the SPLM is not a 
secessionist movement; its leader has stated more than once that 
his favorite option is a unified, democratic, secular Sudan. 
Garang has stated this stance more than once. I believe that 
Garang is not a separatist, but a unionist. Regarding the plan 
submitted at the SPLM congress, we have not yet received the 
text of that plan. However, we do know that the SPLM is in 
control of certain areas in southern Sudan. They want to run a 
civil administration in that area. This is their right and it 
does not mean a step toward secession. This is my view, 
according to the information I have so far received. 
  [Text] [AL-WAFD] In the light of all these changes, how do 
you view the future of the NDG? Will it overcome its crisis or 
will the Sudanese opposition embark on other organizational 
courses? 
  [Al-Tijani] The NDG was formed of parties and forces with 
their own differences. These differences come to the surface 
from time to time, but it was possible to resolve most of them 
during the past four years. We in the NDG have agreed on a 
formula not only to bring down the regime, but also to solve the 
chronic government crisis in Sudan on the basis of an agreement 
reached by all the Sudanese parties and forces. This agreement 
constitutes part of the NDG charter, its program, and 
resolutions. We think that the majority of the Sudanese people 
accept and support the NDG formula. 
  There is no doubt that we in the opposition will strengthen 
our unity and cohesion. The NDG will remain in the field as an 
instrument for the Sudanese opposition, whether some people 
agree or not. We are confident that the great majority of the 
NDG forces are satisfied with it and its representational 
capacity and are ready to work together to bring down the NIF. 
Whoever works for the good of the people will survive, but the 
scum will disappear. Mutual consent is the solution. 
  [AL-WAFD] Finally, do you think it would be useful to hold a 
meeting between the Communist Party and the Ummah Party to 
discuss their problems? 
  [AL-Tijani] We held regular, scheduled meetings with the 
Ummah Party less than a month ago. We discussed many of the 
issues of interest to the NDG and the whole country. If 
differences have emerged, they should not provoke insults. This 
is something that we do not approve of. Democracy recognizes 
differences of views. We respect the right of the Ummah Party 
to defend its views by democratic means. We also ask it in 
return to respect our views and not to insult us. We have not 
insulted anyone, but expressed our views. We may disagree, but 
we do not insult anyone. We express our views frankly and 
boldly, while at the same time expressing our readiness to meet 
half way with any force that we disagree with. We think that 
decisions in the NDG must be reached through mutual consent. 
The NDG was established on this basis. When the NDG was 
established, the parties in it had differences of views. Even 
the SPLM and the Ummah Party, which used to fight each other, 
are now in the same grouping. Differences do exist, and we 
cannot disregard them, nor can we resolve them over night. The 
only solution is for us to achieve mutual consent on all 
decisions we make for the good of the Sudanese people.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators continue to meet for the third consecutive day in an 
attempt to finalize an agreement on the implementation of 
Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Legal Affairs Committee, the Security Committee, and the 
Committee on Detainees are trying to work out some of the still 
unsettled points ahead of the signing ceremony, which is 
scheduled for tomorrow morning, Wednesday. 
  Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi, who leads the Palestinian team to 
the 
Civilian Affairs Committee, said that the Israeli side 
backtracked on several of the points previously agreed upon. He 
added that the PLO and Israel will sign the agreement 
nevertheless. 
  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who are both due in Cairo today, will 
meet at 1800 at the Presidential Palace to discuss some 
unresolved issues, particularly those concerning Jericho's area 
and police presence on the Allenby Bridge.

address a ceremony in the Conference Hall in Madinat Nasr at 
1100 [0900 GMT] on Wednesday [4 May] for the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will also 
address the ceremony, after which the U.S. and Russian foreign 
ministers will deliver speeches before signing of the agreement. 
  Announcing this, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, 
the foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, Norway, 
Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, Morocco, and Qatar, and the Omani

  Musa added that a bilateral meeting will be held tomorrow 
between Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister

  The foreign minister said the agreement is a step along the 
road and not the end of the Palestinian-Israeli track. 
  Replying to a question on the U.S. efforts to advance 
negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track, Musa said: We are 
talking about a comprehensive peace process. Egypt backs all 
serious and important steps that lead to progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, chief PLO negotiator at the </F>
Israeli-Palestinian Cairo talks, by Faridah al-Shubashi in Cairo 
on 2 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Two days separate us from the signing 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What is the status of the 
negotiations and what have the two sides accomplished so far? 
  [Sha'th] We are about to reach a full agreement that will 
cover all aspects of life in Gaza and Jericho and will be ready 
for the signature of President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin Wednesday morning, 4 May. This agreement now is 
in its final stages. Of course some issues require final 
decisions [words indistinct] issues related to stationing a 
Palestinian officer on the Allenby bridge and crossings, [words 
indistinct] on the Gaza coast. Other issues will be completed 
before reaching this agreement, God willing. This agreement 
will also include the agreements reached by the Palestinian and 
Israeli delegations in the Paris economic talks. The entire 
economic agreement will become one of the elements of this 
agreement, which we will sign here. 
  The agreement will also cover all the civilian and security 
issues and all the powers the Palestinian authority will 
exercise. All security issues related to the Israeli withdrawal 
and the [word indistinct] and deployment of the Palestinian 
police, as well as the agreement on releasing the detainees. 
What remains is the drafting of certain articles related to the 
preamble of the agreement and some agreements that were agreed 
on in principle between President 'Arafat and Foreign Minister 
Peres here in Cairo; that is, the Palestinian passport, its form 
and details; the international presence agreed on in Gaza and 
Jericho and its details; the Palestinian postage stamp and the 
Palestinians' right to international postal union; and certain 
issues related to special Palestinian powers at the Rafah 
crossing. We agreed that the Rafah crossing will be open 24 
hours a day, 365 days a year, and will be open not only for 
people but for trucks, goods, and private vehicles. The special 
crossing between Gaza and Jericho was agreed to be open 365 days 
a year for people, goods, and vehicles. The final touches will 
be put on all these issues today and tomorrow. 
  [Al-Shubashi] In the news conference held when U.S. 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher and Peres were present in 
Cairo--held jointly with President Mubarak--'Arafat said that he 
hoped for tangible progress so that he could present it to his 
people. Does this mean that the Palestinian president is still 
unable to say that he has anything to present to his people? 
  [Sha'th] Until this moment we are still negotiating. We have 
not implemented [word indistinct] to put what we negotiated into 
practice. Will this really happen the morning after the 
agreement, that is, Thursday or Friday after the signing 
ceremony on Wednesday? The Palestinians [word indistinct] 
thousands of detainees will be let out of prisons; hundreds of 
deportees will return to their children; 6,000 Palestinian 
soldiers and officers will return to the homeland with their 
families. The doors will be open and the Israeli withdrawal 
will take a speedy form and there will be daily hand-overs of 
camps occupied by the Israeli Army to the Palestinian people and 
police. The Palestinian authority will enter led by brother 
Yasir 'Arafat. This authority will take over all the powers the 
Israelis have been exercising. 
  The Palestinian citizen will feel the great difference, and 
the long hours of suffering as a result of searches and 
interrogation, more searching and interrogations, will end. The 
economic assistance will begin pouring in and the Palestinian 
economic institutions will be established to provide a decent 
living for our people gradually. Many things will happened. 
The Gaza airport will be opened after a short time from the 
entry of ... [pauses] and [word indistinct] in Gaza and Jericho, 
travel between Gaza and Jericho and then travel between Gaza and 
Cairo. Preparations will begin to establish an international 
airport as soon as possible. Ships will start arriving at Gaza 
in preparation for the opening of the Gaza international harbor. 
The fishermen will suddenly have the right to fish up to 20 
miles without restrictions. The shores will open and the major 
part of the security restrictions that prevented the people of 
Gaza even from eating fish will end. They will find that the 
shore is theirs. The Israeli presence, which is sitting on 
their chests in the camps and streets, will end and they will 
find their children wearing the Palestinian uniform, Palestinian 
flags, and the Palestinian insignia offering protection for them 
instead of pursuing and repressing them everywhere. All of this 
and much more will be what brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
sees as the tangible results on the ground. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, last question: What was the U.S. 
stand that the U.S. secretary of state brought him? Has the 
United States begun to realize that the Palestinian problem 
should be solved with at least a minimum of justice? 
  [Sha'th] No doubt there is a feeling that the lost time is 
over and there can be no possibility for any more delay. The 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles should go ahead 
and implementation of other steps in the Palestinian arena 
should continue in terms of an early transfer of power in the 
West Bank and Israeli's withdrawal from the West Bank cities and 
villages, and then the final solution for the Palestinian 
problem should begin in a complete manner. We have heard from 
Peres that Israel will shorten the transitional period from five 
to three years. This means that we must begin negotiating on 
the West Bank immediately. This is for the Palestinian arena... 
  [Al-Shubashi, interrupting] Including the removal of the 
settlements? 
  [Sha'th] No doubt, the issue of the settlements will 
immediately enter the final negotiations. There is no solution 
without a full removal of these settlements. Moreover, 
Jerusalem is at the heart of our actions. Measures related to 
Jerusalem must begin immediately and negotiations on Jerusalem 
must begin immediately. In principles, all restriction on the 
city of Jerusalem and the other West Bank cities must end. By 
the way, there will be no barriers between Gaza, Jericho, and 
the West Bank. There will be no measurers relating to entry and 
departure from these territories. We are applying the measures 
pertaining to the fact that, even at the first stage, the West 
Bank and Gaza are an integrated whole, inseparable, and whole 
territorial entity. 
  But I say that the United States clearly is interested in 
beginning the solution in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. 
Therefore, Christopher's travel to Damascus, then to Israel, 
and then to Damascus is to emphasize the idea of a comprehensive 
solution and the need for implementation to begin on the Syrian 
front and on the Jordanian and Lebanese front and not only on 
the Palestinian front. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Why has Israel criticized Egypt's recent role 
and protested against it? 
  [Sha'th] I do not know. All I can imagine is that Egypt has 
never denied that it has been working to support Palestinian 
rights and has never said it was a neutral state. It is true 
that it is tied to Israel by a treaty -- which Egypt has 
respected fully and proven that through peace, rights and 
security for all will be realized -- but Egypt never said that 
it was a neutral state between the Palestinians and Israel and 
has worked throughout the negotiations to back Palestinian 
rights. If this sometimes angers the Israelis then let it be. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli talks aimed at 
reaching agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, has said 
the two delegations have almost completed drafting the major 
part of the agreement. He added that the Israeli withdrawal 
from self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho will actually begin the 
day of the signing, Wednesday [4 May]. 
  In press statements today, he said the remaining issues 
concern some security arrangements in Gaza, the maritime borders 
of the self-rule authority in Gaza, and the map of Gaza. He 
noted that discussion of these issues will be completed this 
evening and that the discussion on legal jurisdiction is almost 
over. 
  Sha'th said the foreign ministers of Egypt, the United 
States, and Russia will sign the final agreement in addition to 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  He affirmed that the agreement stipulates that the Israeli 
withdrawal will be completed within three weeks following the 
signing and he noted that the Israeli side has pledged to 
complete the withdrawal in two weeks. 
  He said some Israeli camps will be evacuated Thursday 
evening 
or Friday morning after the signing and that the withdrawal will 
begin the day of the signing. 
  He said a unit made up of 1,000 Palestinian policemen will 
enter Gaza and Jericho Thursday morning and that the remainder 
of the force will arrive within three weeks. 
  This force is comprised of 9,000 personnel, 7,000 of whom 
come from outside the occupied territories and 2,000 from inside. 
  Sha'th said that a Palestinian security delegation led by 
Ziyad al-Atrash will arrive in Cairo today. He noted that the 
Palestinian police are ready to enter Gaza and Jericho 
immediately after the Israeli withdrawal and denied Israeli 
claims to the contrary. 
  As for the Palestinian detainees, the Palestinian official 
said that all points concerning the timetable of their release 
have been agreed upon. He said that every Palestinian, whether 
an individual or member of a Palestinian organization, should be 
bound by the agreements and pledges to which the PLO has 
committed itself. 
  Commenting on the meeting of the committee in charge of 
detainees, Sha'th said that a meeting was held yesterday evening 
with Israeli General Yantof Sameh to draw up the timetable for 
the detainees' release. 
  In another development, sources close to negotiations have 
told MENA that the points still under discussion are related to 
territorial waters. The Palestinians demand 12 nautical miles, 
while the Israelis insist on giving them only three nautical 
miles. 
  As for mapping lands around roads, the Israelis want to set 
aside 55 meters on either side of each road that is not to be 
disposed of or built on. The Palestinians want this area to be 
35 meters on each side. 
  In another development, it has been learned that some 
40-to-50 Palestinian deportees will return to Gaza and Jericho 
the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, and that 1,000 detainees will 
be released on Thursday, the day after the autonomy agreement is 
signed. 
  It has also been learned that Israel has agreed to give the 
Palestinians 20 nautical miles for fishing purposes. The issue 
of joint patrols along parallel roads has not been settled yet.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations resumed their final round of negotiations today to 
put the final touches on the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho before signing it in Cairo on Wednesday [4 May]. 
  In a statement to MENA, Palestinian delegation member Khalid 
al-Qidrah affirmed that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will 
enter the self-rule area in Jericho and Gaza a month after the 
agreement has been signed. He added that all the Palestinian 
police force personnel will have entered the area and taken up 
their positions before 'Arafat arrives. 
  The force is made up of 9,000 men, 6,000 of whom are from 
outside the occupied territories and 3,000 from inside. 
  Al-Qidrah said that as soon as the agreement is signed, 
1,500 
members of the Palestinian police force will enter the self-rule 
areas and their families will join them later. 
  MENA has learned that the Palestinian-Israeli Coordination 
Committee formed under the Cairo Accord will be chaired on the 
Palestinian side by Ziyad al-Atrash and on the Israeli side by 
Yantof Sameh [name as transliterated], who was the Gaza ruler a 
few months ago. 
  Sources at the negotiations said Muhammad Dahlan, official 
in 
charge in security in the Gaza Strip, and Nasr Yusuf, official 
in charge of police there who is due in Cairo later today, will 
arrive in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. 
  The sources noted that the agreement to implement self-rule 
in Gaza and Jericho to be signed by Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is about 200 
pages. In addition to the general agreement, the sources added, 
the accord contains four appendixes; the first concerns the 
economic agreement signed in Paris last Friday, the second deals 
with security arrangements, the third with legal jurisdiction, 
and the fourth with civil authority. 
  Al-Qidrah affirmed that the work of the Legal Affairs 
Committee is in the final stages because it is now drafting 
clauses concerning criminal jurisdiction. 
  He explained that the issue of al-Mawasi, areas on the 
Mediterranean coast extending into the Gaza waters, has been 
settled as nature reserves are under Palestinian jurisdiction. 
He said the question of territorial waters on the Mediterranean 
opposite the strip will be decided during today's talks. 
  Sources close to the negotiations have said that a report on 
the hand over of Palestinian collaborators with the occupation 
authorities to the self-rule authority is untrue. The sources 
affirmed that the collaborator issue was settled during the 
talks in Taba within the context of the Confidence-Building 
Committee and that the collaborators will obtain Israeli 
nationality and the Palestinian self-rule authority will issue 
them pardons.

foreign policy adviser to Yasir 'Arafat. Bein, talking to 
No'omi Segal about the observers responsibilities: 
  [Begin recording] [Bein] Their job is exactly defined, and 
that is to help promote stability and an appropriate environment 
conducive to the enhancement of the well-being of the 
Palestinians in Hebron and their economic development; and to 
monitor the efforts to restore safety of the Palestinians and 
events effecting it, and the return to normal life in the city 
of Hebron. 
  [Segal] Will the observers be armed? 
  [Bein] No, they will not be armed, although in the original 
agreement they may be armed with pistols for their self-defense. 
But it was agreed among the three participating countries -- 
Norway, Denmark, and Italy -- that they do not want to be armed. 
  [Segal] What is Israel's response to that? Do security 
forces feel that in addition to being responsible for the 
security of Jewish and Palestinian residents of Hebron, they 
will now also have to be responsible for the observers? 
  [Bein] Well, there is no question about it that the only 
ones responsible for any security aspect in the area is Israel. 
That is very clear, we are there and the Civil Administration 
and the military authorities are responsible for security. But 
these countries feel that those observers walking around with 
white uniforms and with arm bands and in cars which are clearly 
marked, they will be safer without pistols than with pistols. 
  [Segal] How can their presence deter any kind of clashes 
between Jewish settlers and Palestinians there? Do you have any 
assurances that those sides will respect their presence and that 
they will be a factor in preventing any kind of clashes? 
  [Bein] Well, their presence cannot prevent clashes. For 
that there are security forces there, and they are going to 
prevent it. What they are going to do is to report on any 
incident, and that's the only job of an observer. He reports, 
he doesn't interfere. Mainly the Palestinians, but we too, 
believe that the very presence of some observers, and clearly 
when they are with a white uniform, standing there with 
binoculars, and maybe with a camera, and writing down the 
details, the very presence of people like this in the area might 
induce tranquility. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Association of Kuwaiti </F>
Correspondents; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Quoting a report by the U.S. Overseas Press Club, 
the Cable News Network, CNN, has reported that there are 22 
correspondents held in jail in Kuwait as prisoners of 
conscience. The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents, which 
was astonished by such a report and its timing, especially as it 
was carried by a network that is particular about its sources 
and its information, would like to indicate that the information 
and figures contained in this report are totally false. 
  The association would also like to express its deep 
disappointment and indignation at the release of such reports on 
the State of Kuwait. Through this statement, the association 
would like to stress that there is not one single prisoner of 
conscience in Kuwait, and that the State of Kuwait is one of the 
few countries in the world where there are no prisoners of 
conscience. 
  The truth of the matter, and in order to correct the 
information, is that the report carried by CNN, which was 
quoting the U.S. Overseas Press Club, concerns those who 
collaborated with the authorities of the treacherous Iraqi enemy 
during its occupation of the State of Kuwait. Those 
collaborators took part in the publication of what was called 
AL-NIDA paper. This paper was the mouthpiece of the despotic 
Iraqi regime and it expressed its criminal and erroneous 
policies and harmed Kuwait's political and diplomatic standing 
during the period of the tyrannical occupation. Those 
collaborators, which were concerned by the totally false report, 
worked for the benefit of the Iraqi enemy occupying the land of 
Kuwait and carried out actions aimed at weakening the morale of 
the Kuwaiti people and their spirit of resistance by taking part 
in the publication of what was called AL-NIDA paper. 
  Those mentioned in that fabricated report are now in prison 
because they collaborated with the Iraqi enemy and not because 
of an opinion they wrote in the Kuwaiti press or because of a 
viewpoint they expressed in that press. It is worth noting that 
all those prisoners are craftsmen and technicians specialized in 
printing and maintenance of printing equipment, and that the 
majority hold Iraqi and Jordanian citizenships. 
  As is common knowledge, these people were tried by the 
Kuwaiti justice -- which is renowned for its fairness -- for 
collaborating with the Iraqi occupying enemy. Their trial was 
held in open sessions and in the presence of the international 
press, TV stations, news agencies, Red Cross delegates, and 
organizations concerned with human rights. The CNN 
correspondent was one of those attending those trials. All 
legal guarantees were offered to the prisoners concerned during 
their trial. Everyone witnessed the impartiality and fairness 
of those trials. 
  The Association of Kuwaiti Correspondents would like to 
reaffirm that there are no prisoners of conscience in the State 
of Kuwait and it wishes the CNN and the U.S. Overseas Press Club 
to check the accuracy of their information before reporting 
them. The Association is also totally prepared to cooperate to 
clarify any piece of information that any side would like to 
verify on the situation of journalists and the press in the 
State of Kuwait.

  [Text] Kuwait, 30 Apr -- Kuwait's Central Bank Governor 
Shaykh Salim 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sabah ruled out in remarks 
published here today that the decrease in world oil prices would 
have a negative effect on the Kuwaiti dinar's exchange rate. 
  Shaykh Salim al-Sabah told Al-Siyassah newspaper in an 
interview that the exchange rate of the Kuwaiti dinar was linked 
to a basket of currencies of Kuwait's principal companies 
dealing in trade and financial operations. 
  He clarified that the Kuwaiti dinar was unlikely to be 
affected by the decrease in oil prices. He said that it would 
not be devalued, especially if it was taken into consideration 
that its exchange rate mechanism suited the Kuwaiti economy, had 
proven to be effective in gradually lowering imported inflation, 
and maintained relatively stable exchange rates against major 
currencies. 
  Shaykh Salim al-Sabah said the strong performance of local 
companies during 1992 and 1993, and the remunerative profits 
which were distributed, helped maintain the stability of local 
shares and fought off pressures to push them down. 
  The Kuwaiti Central Bank governor said the decrease in the 
discount rate - which reflected increasing confidence in the 
stability of the overall monetary system - would bring local 
interest rates close to international levels. 
  He clarified that differences on interest rates on foreign 
currencies was in the interest of the Kuwaiti dinar. 
  In the interview, he indicated that a reduction in the 
interest rate of the dinar would help stimulate local economic 
activities. 
  Shaykh Salim mentioned that the Kuwaiti Central Bank would 
not obstruct local loans to banks but said that bank management 
had begun to review their lending policies to test their 
effectiveness. That was in harmony with the latest economic and 
financial developments where a policy of awareness and caution 
were being pursued.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, minister of </F>
state for foreign affairs, by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some Arab states have 
criticized the fact that you have hosted a meeting of the Water 
Committee including an Israeli delegation for the first time in 
an Arab Gulf state. Some have accused you of trying to drag or 
persuade the Gulf states to normalize relations with Israel. 
What is your reaction to these charges? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] That criticism did not come as a surprise to 
us. On the contrary, we see it as something natural and 
expected. We are aware of the phrases used in that criticism. 
We view it as a part of the serious thinking about the peace 
process. That criticism was made because of these states' 
interest in establishing peace. [passage omitted] As I said, 
we are not annoyed by such criticism which we believe is 
natural. It will not affect our relations, links, and absolute 
support for the other Arab states, especially Syria, Lebanon, 
Jordan, and the Palestinians. We do so despite the fact that 
the press in these states criticized the presence of an Israeli 
delegation in Muscat as part of the international working team 
within the Water Committee. We do not have a complex about such 
criticism. I believe that the fraternal states adjacent to 
Israel have to say these things because their cricumstances and 
political positions on the peace process necessitate such 
statements by them. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] You have held direct meetings with the 
Israeli delegation.... It has been claimed that Oman might 
start establishing bilateral relations with Israel gradually, 
say by exchanging delegations, particularly in the spheres of 
water and agriculture. Has an agreement to that effect been 
reached between you and Israel, and have you kept a channel of 
contact open? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] The talks with the Israeli delegation did 
not go beyond the multilateral negotiations. We were crystal 
clear and meant to be so. In my interview with the Israeli 
press and television I stated very clearly that the Israeli 
leaders should not expect such steps by the Arab states before a 
comprehensive and lasting peace is established with the 
neighboring Arab states. I believe there is no room for 
confusion or misunderstanding at all. We explained clearly that 
neither Oman, the Arab Gulf states, nor any other Arab state 
would be willing to establish any kind of diplomatic contacts 
with Israel before the latter honors its commitments under the 
peace process and before withdrawal (from the occupied 
territories) and implementation of the Security Council 
resolutions agreed upon in the context of the peace process. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Oman got the Water Committee's approval for 
it to set up an international center for the development of 
water desalination technology. Will you permit the presence of 
Israeli experts in it or the use of Israeli research and 
technology in its activities before the political peace process 
through the bilateral committees is completed? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] It is going to be an international water 
research center. All the Arab and other states in the Middle 
East will benefit from it. We do not expect results regarding 
that center in the immediate future. There are separate 
advanced research activities in the United States, Japan, 
Russia, and Western Europe. It has also been reported that 
there are advanced desalination researches in Israel and South 
Africa. I mean that the advanced industrial states have 
researches in this fields and we intend to benefit from all that 
and turn the theoretical part of them into applied technology. 
If there is some useful research in Israel then that would be a 
scientific issue and has nothing to do with politics, and we 
separate scientific issues from political issues. I believe 
that this matter will take some time and we expect the peace 
process to be completed before we can get these separate 
technologies. [passge omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Are there any differences within the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] over the question of some states 
hosting meetings of multilateral committees with the 
participation of Israeli delegations? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] I will not be saying anything new in this 
connection. It had been understood in the Madrid context that 
Israel wished the meetings to be held in the Middle East but the 
Arab states were not convinced. Then there was an understanding 
that the multilateral negotiations could be moved to the Middle 
East once practical steps were taken in the bilateral 
negotiations. It was not specified whether such steps should be 
taken collectively on all fronts or separately. When the 
Declaration of Principles between the PLO and Israel was signed, 
that was seen as a positive step in the right direction in the 
direct negotiations...and it was seen as a pointer and as a step 
on the basis of which multilateral negotiations could be moved 
to the Middle East, and that is what happened. [passage omitted] 
  There are no differences on this matter but perhaps the 
willingness to host such conferences in the presence of an 
Israeli delegation within the committees differs from one state 
to another because of different circumstances and concepts but 
there is absolutely no disagreement within the GCC on the issue 
of hosting multilateral committees. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] The question of your relations with Israel 
is linked to the vision of the region's future you once 
outlined, which was quoted by an Egyptian paper, to the effect 
that the Arabic language, Arabism, and the Arab system were 
finished and that the geographical reality which should be 
addressed was now the Middle East. Does this mean that you now 
seek abolition of the Arab regional system and institutions such 
as the Arab League and wish to replace them with a Middle 
Eastern system including non-Arab states such as Iran, Israel, 
and Turkey? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] First of all, what the Egyptian paper 
AL-JUMHURIYAH published in the name of its editor did not quote 
me accurately. The Arabic language exists. It is the language 
of the Koran. Nobody can deny that, but what I said then was 
that our use of the Arabic language was not up to the ideal 
level, and if we maintain that the Arabic language is the 
leading ideological and political language then we use it better 
in order to be able to express ourselves clearly like the other 
now international languages. AL-JUMHURIYAH confused the Middle 
East concept with the Arabic language concept. 
  What I mean to say is that the Middle East concept does not 
negate the Arab concept. On the contrary, the Arabs own the 
Middle East but we should not appear to be racist, and Arab 
nationalism or Arabism should not appear to be a racist 
phenomenon. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] In other words, you are not calling for the 
abolition of the Arab League? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] The Arab League is still the right 
institution for the Arabs. We all agree on that but it may not 
be able to fulfill Arab needs in the next century in view of the 
international groupings. Although we established the Arab 
League over 40 years ago, we have been unable to create common 
interests for the Arab League. The Arab league was originally 
formed for the liberation of Palestine. [passage omitted] Now 
that the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict are 
on their way to a settlement in harmony with the new world, the 
Arab League should not remain within the confines of the past, 
otherwise it would be ineffective once the Palestinian question 
and the Arab-Israeli conflict are resolved. The Arab League 
would be ineffective if it does not develop. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] You have agreed to lift the indirect boycott 
of Israel at some levels. Have you in Oman actually begun 
abolishing the the second and third degree boycott measures? Do 
you believe that interests should replace pan-Arab links in the 
region and that your relations with Israel, for instance, should 
be on an equal level with your relations with the Arab states if 
the interests were the same? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] First of all, interests should be the basis 
of relations between states, even between the Arab states, 
because common interests are the basis of the links between them. 
  Second, the issue of the second- and third-level boycott has 
no direct connection with Israel. These were measures taken by 
the Arab states to underscore their dissatisfaction with the way 
other states treated Israel. But the situation now is quite 
different. The Western states, the United States, and the 
industrial states in general have now passed legislation 
forbidding all industrial and commercial establishments from 
responding to the second and third Arab boycott levels. That 
means that if we maintain the second and third boycott levels 
against foreign companies which deal with Israel, we would be 
halting the wheel of development in our own countries. That 
would be highly detrimental to our countries. We are developing 
countries whose industrial progress depends primarily on the 
machines, equipment, and expertise we import from the major 
industrial states. So we have had to respond to the 
legislations introduced in these states. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Oman's position on the situation in the 
Gulf region is known, particularly the need to reconsider the 
position on Iraq. How do you now view Iraq's chances of getting 
approval for a gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on it, 
particularly as it has complied with most UN resolutions and 
renounced its claims to Kuwait? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] The lifting of the sanctions against Iraq 
falls within the jurisdiction of the Security Council and we 
know that the power there is in the hands of the permanent 
members. Lifting the sanctions requires a Security Council 
resolution. It is quite clear that the members are not prepared 
to lift the sanctions in one go before Iraq fully complies with 
all the resolutions and conditions of the Council. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is true that Iraq has indicated in one way or another 
recently that it no longer considers Kuwait to be a part of 
Iraq, but is that enough, politically? It may be important to 
understand that such statements are perhaps seen as politically 
insufficient to end the existing differences between the GCC 
states and Iraq. We believe that Iraq should do more. We do not 
wish to get into an argument as to which comes first, the cart 
or the horse. 
  Kuwait is an independent sovereign state with 
internationally 
recognized borders confirmed by the Security Council. These 
matters are not open to discussion or argument and cannot be 
questioned or reconsidered. Iraq should realize that its 
protection from the various dangers which they call "foreign 
plots" would depend on Arab support for Iraq. Such support 
appears to be nonexistent at present. Iraq should fully 
reconsider its Arab policies and its concept of inter-Arab 
relations. If it does that and if it commits itself to new 
policies toward the Gulf states and the other Arab states, Iraq 
would then be able to feel that the Arab states could provide it 
with the cover that might help it avert the so-called foreign 
plots. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some people believe that the Arab states 
have not done enough to prevent what appears to be 
"international tampering" with Iraq's unity. Do you in Oman 
have any worries regarding the Kurdish government in northern 
Iraq? Have you received or met with any Iraqi opposition 
delegations? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] The first responsibility falls on the 
shoulders of Iraq and not the Arab states. That is why we say: 
If Iraq reassesses its Arab relations and policies in a manner 
that would make the Arabs trust these policies and not see them 
as just tactics, we believe that the Arab states would then 
become an element of strength in that respect. As regards the 
Kurdish issue, it is full of complications, and views on it 
differ. True, if northern Iraq is separate from the country, 
the matter would not stop there, it would continue, particularly 
as there are various minorities in the region, but nobody would 
feel happy about anything of that kind. Iraq's current 
circumstances, however, mean such matters are to be expected. 
If it did occur, it would not occur easily and would lead to 
new tragedies. 
  We in the GCC have, in every session, declared that we are 
against any violation of Iraq's unity and territorial integrity. 
That is a firm principle. As regards the Iraqi opposition, the 
firm principle in the general policy of the Sultanate of Oman is 
that we do not interfere in the internal affairs of others even 
if we disagree with them. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] There has been no improvement in 
Iranian-Gulf relations. That expectation for which you in Oman 
made great efforts, has not materialized. In fact, there may 
have been a deterioration since the islands crisis with the 
United Arab Emirates [UAE]. 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] The GCC states and Iran always express a 
genuine desire to develop bilateral relations to levels that 
would be in their mutual interests. That is the constant 
policy. As regards differences between GCC states and Iran, 
that is normal. Differences do occur between neighboring states. 
What is important is the ability to prevent it from reaching 
the point of explosion. On all the disputed issues between the 
GCC states and Iran, there is a desire to settle them by 
peaceful means and at bilateral levels. So, there is no 
deterioration, but the agreement that every state should tackle 
its issues with Iran bilaterally perhaps gives the impression 
that there is no collective action. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do Oman's decision to withdraw its members 
from the military committee in Yemen and your statement after 
the Salalah meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid mean that the Sultanate is washing 
its hands of the attempts to resolve the Yemeni crisis? Will 
you support the Egyptian-UAE initiative? 
  [Bin-'Abdallah] It is not true that Oman has washed its 
hands of helping to resolve the Yemeni crisis. We have never 
said that. It was a press allegation. We ended our work in the 
military committee because that work was completed. That is a 
Yemeni committee which continues to exist but the work left for 
it to do is up to the Yemeni side. There is no longer a need 
for the presence of Oman and Jordanian officers. [passage 
omitted] We would support any Arab efforts by the brothers in 
Egypt, Oman, or any other country. What is important to us is 
that Yemen should remain united and stable. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on "first ever" interview given to Israeli media </F>
with Foreign Minister al-Thani by unidentified correspondents in 
Doha on 3 May] 
  [Text] The Qatari foreign minister said today that he sees 
no problem with Qatar establishing diplomatic relations with 
Israel, but this must come after peace is established throughout 
the Middle East. He made the remark a few minutes ago in a 
conversation with Israeli reporters in Doha, upon the opening of 
the multinational talks on arms control. Our correspondent in 
Qatar Netan'el Semrik is on the telephone line from Qatar with 
the gist of the first-ever interview a Qatari foreign minister 
gave the Israeli media: 
  [Semrik] Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur al-Thani, the 
Foreign Affairs Minister of the Qatari Emirate, smiled at the 
Israeli cameras and told the Israeli microphones that in 
principle he does not oppose visiting Israel. Everything 
depends on the pace of the progress of the talks on all the 
other tracks, he said. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Thani, in English] Well, I cannot 
answer this question but if everything goes well in all the 
peace process on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks, then I do 
not see there is any problem. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Would you like to 
invite the Israeli prime minister here to Qatar? 
  [Al-Thani, laughing, in English] Thank you very much. [end 
recording] 
  [Semrik] The minister said he cannot answer the question on 
whether he would like to visit Israel, but he has no problem in 
doing so, provided the talks on the Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese 
tracks make proper progress.

  [Text] Doha, Apr. 25, INA--Qatari Information Minister Dr. 
Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Kawari received today Iraq's Information 
Under Secretary and Head of the Iraqi Delegation, Naji 
al-Hadithi. 
  During the meeting, the Qatari minister welcomed the Iraqi 
cultural delegation, saying the Arab culture is part and parcel, 
and its most prominent sources are the Iraqi culture and arts. 
  The Iraqi cultural week will certainly contribute to 
strengthening cultural ties between Iraq and Qatar, confirming 
his country's keenness to help succeed this cultural

  [Text] United Nations, April 28, SPA -- Saudi Minister of 
State and cabinet member Muhammad Ibrahim Mas'ud told the United 
Nations Security Council Wednesday that the Kingdom has spared 
no efforts to support the cause of the Bosnian people and that 
the Saudi Government continues to extend political and moral 
support to the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina out of its 
religious and historic responsibilities. 
  In an address to the Security Council Wednesday, Mas'ud said 
the Kingdom has extended financial and in kind support and 
relief aid including food and medical supplies to Bosnia since 
the crisis started. 
  He added that the Kingdom has also formed popular fund 
raising committees for Bosnia which resulted in more than sr 
[saudi riyals] 500-million (dlrs [dollars] 134 million) 
collections. 
  He indicated that the Kingdom has also extended medical 
treatment to several wounded Bosnians in Saudi hospitals. 
  On the political level, the custodian of the two Holy 
Mosques 
King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz exerted intensive efforts with 
brothers and friends on all levels and in regional and 
international fora to have the international community take 
swift and effective measures to preserve the entity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in line with a resolution by the OIC foreign 
ministers' sixth extraordinary session, which was held in Jeddah 
in December, 1993. 
  Mas'ud, who met yesterday with the Security Council 
president 
and U.N. secretary general as a member of the Organization of 
the Islamic Conference (OIC) liason team assigned to follow up 
the developments of the Bosnian crisis, said this meeting comes 
at a time when the plight of Bosnian brothers is worsening as 
they suffer from a war of liquidation and ethnic cleansing 
launched by the Serbs more than two years ago. 
  He said tens of thousands of Bosnians have been killed or 
wounded and hundreds of thousands have been rendered homeless 
because of this horrible war, not to mention rapes committed 
under the noses of "your civilized world and the Security 
Council". 
  He said if the Council had taken strict measures against 
aggressors, the destruction burning and inhuman atrocities in 
the Bosnian enclave of Gorazde would have been avoided. 
  He added that Gorazde is still on the verge of a human 
disaster and pointed out that more than 700 people were killed 
and 2,000 wounded in this Bosnian town. 
  He said despite these plights, the Bosnian people continue 
their legitimate struggle against Serb aggression in defence of 
their lives. 
  "We look upon this heroic struggle with respect and 
reverence, and we pray for mercy on the souls of martyrs among 
Bosnian Moslems who fell in the field of honour and sacrificed 
their lives for their homeland and nation where they set the 
greatest example of sacrifice to preserve the dignity of the 
homeland," he said. 
  He stressed that the Bosnian problem has become an 
international one despite its seemingly European nature, and 
European countries and the United States should cooperate with 
the United Nations and the Security Council to put an end to the 
strife in the former Yugoslav republic in a way that guarantees 
the safety, unity and independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina on its 
national soil. 
  He said the international community is required to cooperate 
in implementing sanctions against Serbs for breaching the 
ceasefire several times and preventing relief aid from reaching 
their destinations and for destroying all aspects of human life 
in Bosnia. 
  He pointed out that out of their belief in the necessity of 
realizing international peace and security and in view of the 
deteriorating situation in Bosnia, the OIC members have held 
extraordinary meetings to discuss this issue and always 
confirmed the independence and sovereignty of the Republci of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and called on the United Nations and the 
Security Council to shoulder their responsibilities in this 
connection. 
  Security Council Resolution 913 coincided with this view 
when 
it reaffirmed the sovereignty and political independence of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and strongly condemned Bosnian [as received] 
forces for their continued aggression against the "safe area" of 
Gorazde which led to a massacre of civilians and military 
personnel and caused a great deal of suufering. 
  As a result the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations called 
for lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia and the United States 
called on NATO to take necessary steps to enable Bosnian people 
to practice their legitimate right of self defence. 
  Mas'ud said despite numerous Serb pledges to halt military 
operation and remain committed to a truce and a political 
settlement of the problem, the Serbs always violate their 
international commitments and launch barbaric assaults on 
peaceful Bosnian people, which calls for a strict position by 
the international community to deter the aggressors and support 
the logic of force which is the only one that the Serbs 
understand. 
  The latter stage should be to hold a constructive dialogue 
to 
restore Bosnian rights. 
  "Therefore, we call on the Security Council to expedite 
playing its full part to restore things to normal in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a way that preserves its entity and 
sovereignty and restore stability to all Bosnian parts," he said. 
  He added that in case the Security Council fails to shoulder 
this responsibility, Bosnia should be exempted from the arms 
embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia by Resolution 713. 
  Finally, Mas'ud expressed confidence that the Security 
Council would not be lax in endorsing the principle of 
international legitimacy and would seriously endeavour to 
shoulder its full responsibilities in accordance with the United 
Nations charter to support the credibility of the world body and 
realize international goals of security and stability. 
  The OIC liason team comprises OIC Secretary General Dr. 
Hamed 
Al-Ghabid, Mas'ud and representatives of OIC members: Egypt, 
Iran, Malaysia, Turkey, Tunisia, and Senegal.

  [Text] Riyadh, April 26, SPA -- The Saudi newspapers shed 
light today on a number of topics. Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH 
commenting on the talks held in Riyadh on Sunday evening between 
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz 
and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, said these talks had come 
within the framework of existing coordination between the 
kingdom and Egypt. As the kingdom and Egypt constitute the most 
important pillars of joint Arab work, Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and President Husni Mubarak 
are capable of playing an effective role in the service of the 
Arab cause, said the daily. The kingdom and Egypt have been 
exerting sincere efforts to contain the dangers facing the 
region, added the daily. The kingdom and Egypt, while working 
for tackling the peace process in the Middle East, are aware of 
the Israeli maneuvers to block the march of the peace, the daily 
pointed out. 
  For its part, Mecca-based AL-NADWAH said it has been clear 
that Israel is trying to escape from the pledges it had earlier 
made. This policy of procrastination will have an adverse impact 
on the future of the peace process in the Middle East, said the 
daily. 
  As we face the danger of the Zionist plots in the Middle 
East, the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina face the dangers of the 
plots hatched by the Serbs, added the daily. 
  It has become an essential matter for the international 
community to put an end for the maneuvers of the Serbs and 
Zionists in defiance to the international legitimacy, said the 
daily and added it has also become necessary to take the 
appropriate measures for enhancing the pillars of just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East and the Balkan region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "exclusive" report from London] </F>
  [Text] Observers recall the Committee for the Defense of 
Legitimate Rights [CDLR], established by a group of Saudi 
religious scientists and thinkers months ago. The committee was 
widely highlighted by world media as the first of its kind in 
Saudi Arabia, which is ruled completely by the royal house of 
Sa'ud. 
  The Saudi regime did not receive the shock with much 
patience. The regime pursued members and supporters of the 
committee. It arrested many of them, dismissed many from their 
jobs, and prevented their travel abroad. The step came in the 
wake of two important developments: The first was the 
establishment of the much awaited Shura Council, which is 
appointed by the king and whose decisions are just 
recommendations to him, to take or leave as he pleases -- 
indeed, it would be unimaginable for this council to deviate 
from the regime's directives -- and the second was an operation 
to contain the opposition, which took London as its 
headquarters. Most of its leaders returned to the kingdom. The 
conditions for their return were regarded to be greatly in the 
interest of the Shiites. The Shiite opposition closed down their 
AL-JAZIRAH AL-'ARABIYAH magazine, which they issued from London. 
The government even bought the paper's archives at the 
exorbitant price of 200,000 pounds sterling, despite the little 
information they contained on the ruling family and its 
activities. 
  As a result, the Sunni opposition found itself under siege. 
A move was needed to stir the stagnant water. Therefore, the 
group which established the CDLR decided to follow in the 
footsteps of the Shiite opposition by working abroad. 
Therefore, the committee's spokesman, Dr. al-Mas'ari, left for 
London with a fake passport -- his original passport was 
withheld by the regime. Dr. Sa'd al-Faqih traveled with him. 
Last week, the two men began their political activity after 
asking for political asylum in Britain. 
  The committee's opening statement explains the reason for 
their actions and the basis of their moves in the future. 
  The CDLR statement said the committee transferred its 
activities to London after every means of expression and reform 
in the kingdom become impossible. The statement also said: 
Repressive methods used against the reformists have increased 
and have included preventing their travel, expelling them from 
their jobs, and denying them the right to practice any work. 
They are being pursued, interrogated, detained, imprisoned, and 
tortured and are being threatened with death. 
  The statement appealed to Saudi nationals, those who support 
the removal of injustice and who would like truth and justice to 
prevail, to cooperate with it. 
  AL-SABIL has learned from sources close to al-Mas'ari that 
before his departure, the committee contacted all effective 
forces and figures in Saudi society to arrange matters. It won 
great support for this course of action. Al-Mas'ari's 
activities abroad are supposed to be coupled with great activity 
at home. 
  Al-Mas'ari enjoyed wide-scale coverage in Western media. It 
was learned that the Saudi government contacted London with a 
view to returning him to the kingdom or preventing his political 
work. However, the British government rejected the Saudi demand 
because it infringed on British laws. The Saudi government also 
pressured Dr. al-Faqih's family to force him to return, but 
al-Faqih said he would not return. 
  In light of the above, al-Mas'ari will be the Saudi 
opposition's vigilant eye abroad. He will convey what is 
happening in his home country to the media abroad. His presence 
will spur the opposition at home into action, especially when he 
establishes a magazine or a daily newspaper in the name of the 
opposition, which is expected soon.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, April 29 (AFP) -- The Arabs have nothing 
to fear from Israel in a common market for the Middle East, a 
Gulf study said Friday, as the PLO and Jewish state signed a 
landmark economic accord. 
  But the study by the al-Shariqah chamber of commerce and 
industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the Arab 
League's 22 members must first integrate their economies before 
joining Israel and other countries in a single market. 
  Although Israel has built a relatively large export-oriented 
industrial base, its exports are equivalent to less than 10 
percent of total Arab imports, said the study, published in the 
UAE daily Al-Khalij. 
  Israel's exports of consumer goods stood at between 11 and 
12 
billion dollars in 1992 while Arab imports of such products 
exceeded 40 billion dollars and their total imports have 
remained above 100 billion dollars. 
  Israel's exports of transport equipment stood at 900 million 
dollars in 1990 and those of electrical appliances at 1.6 
billion dollars while Arab imports of such products stood at 
around 42.6 billion dollars, the study said. 
  "Trade is a key component of Israel's Gross Domestic 
Product, 
accounting for nearly 46 percent in 1991," it said. "But the 
figures on Israeli exports show that they will have little 
impact on the imports of Arab countries." 
  In Paris, Israel and the PLO signed a landmark economic 
agreement on Friday, as part of an overall accord to launch 
Palestinian self- rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of 
Jericho. 
  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, who signed for Israel, 
urged 
Arab countries to "remove the walls of economic boycott" and 
lift the embargo in force since the Jewish state was created in 
1948. 
  "None of us can afford economic boycotts," he warned, 
referring to stiff competition from other regions. 
  The al-Shariqah chamber of commerce study saw benefits for 
both Arabs and Israel from a common market although the latter 
would reap more gains given its superior industries. 
  A free trade zone in the region would give Israel access to 
new markets and enable it to ensure its needs in oil and other 
raw materials, according to the study. 
  In return, Arab states would find a new market for their oil 
and gas, but their exports of other goods would not rise greatly 
as the Israeli market is small. 
  The United States and other countries have proposed a 
regional common market encompassing Israel, the Arabs, Turkey 
and Iran, saying this would bring about prosperity and boost 
confidence in peace. 
  But several Arab officials and businessmen have warned such 
a 
project would allow Israel to dominate Arab economies. 
  Gulf Arab states are playing a key role in the multilateral 
track of the Middle East peace process. Oman hosted talks on 
water resources last week and Qatar will be the venue for a 
working session on arms control next week. 
  In an interview with AFP in Oman, Israeli Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin said a common market would benefit all 
parties but stressed the project needed long discussion. 
  "We believe that the realistic option for Arab states to 
brace for the Middle East market is to set up a free trade 
zone," the UAE study said. 
  "Another point is that Israel has a governmental, 
institutional, legal and administrative structure that is far 
superior to that in all Arab countries," it added. 
  "This should prompt our governments to consolidate democracy 
in their political and economic systems and revise their 
policies on education, training, planning and exploitation of 
resources." 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, in an interview 
published Friday in the Qatari newspaper Al-Sharq, criticized 
Arab states, saying they were "not up to the European standards 
of democracy."

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 1 (AFP) -- A United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) coastguard was wounded in a clash when a boat bringing in 
illegal immigrants was intercepted in the Gulf, the official 
news agency WAM reported on Sunday. 
  Coastguards had to call in air force reinforcements when 
they 
came under fire from the boat on Friday off al-Sha'm, in the 
northern emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah, the agency quoted the 
Interior Ministry as saying. 
  "A clash took place between the coastguard patrol and the 
boat, but after an aircraft intervened the boat and all the 
people on board were seized," said acting border- and coastguard 
chief Salih al-Shalwah. 
  He did not say where the boat came from or identify those on 
board. 
  However, police records show most of the illegal immigrants 
captured over the past two decades came from Iran, Pakistan and 
Afghanistan. They came in search of jobs in the oil-rich Gulf 
state. 
  Al-Shalwah gave no further details of the incident, but said 
the wounded soldier was taken to a Dubai hospital and his 
condition was satisfactory. 
  "It is not the first incident of its kind," a Ra's 
al-Khaymah 
coastguard official told AFP by telephone. 
  "There have been many cases involving clashes with 
infiltrators," he added, but refused to reveal the nationalities 
of those involved in Friday's incident.

  [Text] Sanaa, 2 May (INA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman 
of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has welcomed an initiative 
by the parties to the dialogue committee from outside the ruling 
Yemeni coalition, who have called for a meeting among 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and leaders of other 
parties to put an end to the worsening crisis and infighting in 
the country. 
  Al-Bid welcomed the initiative when he received members of 
the dialogue committee from outside the coalition today. 
  The Yemeni president has also agreed to the initiative, 
deeming it a positive beginning to end the crisis in the country.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, </F>
spokesman; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] We heard the statement made yesterday by the 
Presidential Council during its consultative meeting, a 
statement that can only be deemed as emanating from the council 
of the ruling military family, which contradicts its stand on 
unity, democracy, the building of the state, and the merger of 
the Armed Forces. Justifying the military aggression against the 
forces of the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, which began on 27 April and 
continued today, did not require this revolutionary statement, 
which proves to our people and the whole world that the speech 
by the president in Sab'in Square was clearly directed toward 
planning aggression and launching civil war, and was a 
hysterical declaration of war against everyone. The Presidential 
Council statement was issued to confirm this, by asserting that 
the 'Imran operation was to be a lesson to be taken note of by 
anyone with ambition. 
  The family's council has discarded its latest facade, 
revealing its intention to reject the plan to merge forces, 
which had been proposed by the defense minister four times over 
the past few years. The Army merger would prevent the officers 
of the al-Ahmar clan from continuing to dominate the Armed 
Forces, and would expose the corruption and smuggling caused by 
the looting of soldiers' pay and food, the threats and abuse of 
soldiers, the creation of thousands of nonexistent positions in 
every unit, and the gaining of control over most military 
supplies. 
  The merger would have provided the Armed Forces with 
professional capabilities, would have freed them from the circle 
of family and tribal loyalties, and would have turned them into 
a real shield to protect the homeland and its constitutional 
institutions. It would appear that the ultimate aim of 
rejecting the Armed Forces merger and returning their [word 
indistinct] was to isolate and direct blows against them, as 
happened in Abyan, Harf Sufyan and 'Imran. However, the heroic 
defensive efforts of the 3d Brigade in responding to the 
treacherous attack against it, and the foiling of successive 
attacks upon it, will make the gangs of the ruling military 
family pay a high price. At the end of the day they will suffer 
disgrace and utter defeat. 
  What makes one anxious concerning the council statement is 
what it says about democracy and the rule of law. The family 
tramples on this every day, and boasts of having come to power 
with its pistol and the property of others, so that there should 
never again be democracy. It arrived to where it is now through 
the blood of the leaders and heroes of Yemen, through 
internecine tribal strife, and by setting the country ablaze 
through a series of assassinations during the run up to the 
elections. It spent millions in government and private funds to 
corrupt and destroy the elections. It then set out to destroy 
the results of the elections and undermine the unity of the work 
of the constitutional institutions, while planning the 
assassinations of its members and cadres, so as to return to 
totalitarian presidential rule. 
  This is what it is attempting to restore by digging with its 
bloodied fingernails, so as to discard all talk of 
constitutional amendments and attempts to reform the regime. 
After state institutions readied themselves to take up their 
constitutional responsibilities, by establishing security, 
stability, and by providing the people with a decent standard of 
living, it poised itself to threaten the country's safety and 
independence. Today it is working to cripple national consensus 
and the pledge and accord document, which has received both 
national, Arab, and international support, and which had led 
everyone to hope that state institutions destroyed by the ruling 
military family would be put right. That family has destroyed 
everything in the country, so as to have the people, placed for 
years under an autocratic military regime and controlled by a 
partitionist oligarchy, returned unwillingly to such a system 
through chaos, destruction, and war, while entrenching in the 
minds of the people the idea that it was the family which had 
brought unity and democracy. 
  The ruling military family decided to slaughter democracy on 
its glorious anniversary, 27 April, when the president, in 
Sab'in Square, declared indiscriminate war on everyone, on the 
Yemeni Socialist Party -- which he had achieved unity with 
through the dialogue commission -- and on the parties and 
political forces of the nation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning under 
its speaker, Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. The session 
started with the House speaker and members reading al-Fatiha 
[the first chapter in Koran] for the souls of the martyrs of the 
3d and 1st Armored Brigades. 
  The people's deputies then listened to the minutes of the 
previous session and approved it after stressing that it must 
include the statement issued by the House of Representatives' 
extraordinary session last Thursday [28 April] on the 
regrettable events in 'Imran. The House also heard a report 
from the House committee, which is made up of the Defense and 
Security Committee and certain House members, on the 
fact-finding mission concerning the fighting between the 1st and 
3d Armored Brigades. 
  The report includes details of the committee's mission and 
field visits on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday [28 April 
to 1 May] and the program it set for its work. The committee 
exerted great efforts to investigate facts and reach the 
conclusions included in the report, drafting it in a very 
impartial manner without bias toward any party. The committee 
urged the House speaker and members to study carefully the 
information contained in the report, which was obtained from the 
various concerned parties so that the House can, on the basis of 
this information, take decisive measures against those who were 
responsible for agitating the sedition that resulted in the 
death of our brothers and sons from the 1st and 3d Armored 
Brigades, caused material damage -- the destruction of most of 
the equipment and machinery in the camp, and terrorized innocent 
citizens. 
  The parliamentary committee's report was then presented for 
discussion by the people's deputies with the aim of reaching 
conclusions based on the information contained in the report. 
The House can thus reach its own conclusions on the events in 
'Imran city, as well as the various aspects of the regrettable 
crisis, and create the necessary climate to bring all parties 
together to resolve the suffocating crisis and rescue the Yemeni 
people from its aftermath, including the exceptional price hikes 
and fratricide among the children of the same homeland. 
  The deputies also stressed the importance of the House 
assuming its national responsibilities in light of the 
constitutional clauses and bylaws to pool the parliament's 
efforts with all the national efforts and endeavors to resolve 
the crisis and put an end to its threats and establish the 
pillars of the united state of Yemen and preserve national unity. 
  The session was attended by Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam Khalid 
Salman, minister of legal affairs and minister of House of 
Representatives affairs. The House will resume its sessions 
tomorrow, Tuesday, God willing.

  [Text] Sanaa, 2 May (MENA)--An official source in Sanaa has 
accused the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of undermining the 
passing of unitary laws, hampering the unification of state 
institutions, rejecting the integration of the armed forces into 
a single national institution, and not freeing its members from 
party hegemony and loyalty. 
  The source also accused the YSP of rejecting attempts to 
integrate the armed forces in order to achieve its own 
objective, which is to secede from the unitary state and return 
to party dictatorship over the six provinces in the south. 
  The source stressed that there is no use here for any force 
or individual that tramples on democracy and constitutional 
legitimacy.

  [Text] Sanaa, 2 May (MENA) -- An official Interior Ministry 
source in Sanaa has stated that an officer from the Central 
Security branch in Aden was the target of an assassination 
attempt this morning. 
  The source said that Captain Salah al-Khayyat was hit by 
three bullets and taken to the hospital. He noted that the 
incident coincided with the imposition of a siege on the Central 
Security camp in Aden which cut its supply of food, power, 
communications, and transportation. 
  The source said that the security authorities in Aden are 
responsibile for capturing the perpetrators and lifting the 
siege on the camp. He denounced what had happened, describing 
it as a criminal action, and drew attention to its serious 
effects on unity, democracy, and security.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Socialist Party Demands Army </F>
Withdrawal From Seven Governorates"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Authoritative Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] sources have attacked former Foreign Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani for announcing the number of incidents 
and and assassinations to which the YSP has been exposed over 
the past three years. They accused him of appointing himself 
policeman, prosecutor, and judge at the same time. 
  Al-Iryani said that the YSP and its cadres have been exposed 
to nine attempts only, and that the suspects are in jail. But 
the sources stress that the incidents exceed 152. 
  Elsewhere, YSP Information Center sources in Aden have said 
that YSP representatives on the military committee continue to 
insist on the party's position urging that the Armed Forces 
withdraw from the seven governorates (Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, 
Ma'rib, Ta'izz, Ibb, and al-Bayda') and that all military units 
be moved out of these governorates, saying that there is no 
justification for a military presence in these areas, known in 
the past as the fringes between the two parts of Yemen, except 
in the areas which represent protection for the Republic of 
Yemen. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the sources denied that 
the YSP had demanded the withdrawal of what used to be known as 
the southern and northern forces to their positions before 
unity, contrary to what has been reported by some circles in the 
General People's Congress. 
  The YSP demanded that all armed forces, wherever they are, 
be 
treated equally in terms of food, clothes, and other 
necessities. [passage omitted]

crisis erupted," and to ban its employees from exercising 
partisan activities during their work abroad. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 3 
Network in Hebrew at 1355 GMT on 2 May begins a live relay of 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' address to the Knesset plenum in 
response to three no-confidence motions by the opposition on the 
upcoming agreement with the PLO and the ongoing negotiations 
with Syria. Peres' 47-minute speech is punctuated by frequent 
heckling and the correspondent's voice-over summarizing the 
remarks from the floor, which precludes full texting of the 
speech. The foreign minister's remarks in English are given 
within slantlines. What follows are the monitorable parts of 
Peres' address: 
  "On Wednesday, at 1100 in Cairo, we will indeed sign an 
agreement with the Palestinians about the establishment of 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. This is a big day 
for Israel. Nothing will make Israel more Israeli than to be 
rid of its responsibility for 800,000 Palestinians living in a 
small strip of land. Nothing will make Israel more Israeli than 
this agreement. Nothing else can free us of the huge historical 
myth that Gaza belongs to us. We never owned it, and it has 
been a burden to us." 
  "Nothing will unite the people more than our departure from 
the Gaza Strip. If you want to speak about polls, let me tell 
you that 84 percent of the people support a withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip. Nothing will legitimize the Zionist Movement more 
(?than this move). From the United States to Russia, from India 
to China; in Oman, Qatar, Morocco, Tunisia -- the State of 
Israel is being recognized for the first time. This is 
something you never dreamed of or experienced." 
  Turning to the opposition, Peres says: "You invented 
autonomy; you recognized the PLO. You favored autonomy in all 
the territories, not just in Gaza and in Jericho; you sat with 
'Abd-al-Shafi in Madrid and you made an agreement with the PLO 
in 1982 concerning Lebanon." Peres asserts that a government in 
which the late Menahem Begin was a member "proposed to withdraw 
from the entire Golan Heights in time of peace," and cites the 
Israeli Government resolution of 19 June 1967 that Israel should 
strive for a peace treaty with Syria "based on the international 
border and Israel's security needs." 
  Peres adds: "When the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria 
were granted Jordanian passports we all welcomed it. How is a 
Jordanian passport with the right to vote in elections to the 
Jordanian Parliament better than a laissez-passer -- also known 
as a passport -- to 800,000 inhabitants of Gaza? Do you want to 
bar 800,000 people the right to move? Do you want to grant them 
Israeli passports? Is that what you want?" "As far as 
passports are concerned, there are three possibilities: either 
grant them Israeli passports, give them Gazan passports, or 
leave them without passports. Will it please you to leave them 
without passports? Do you want to annex the Gaza Strip and make 
its inhabitants Israeli citizens? Is that what you want?" 
  "An agreement will be reached in Cairo to set up an autonomy 
in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. Israel will remain in charge 
of external security, all the settlements will remain in their 
place, and we will be responsible for their safety. Autonomy 
will be enforced in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, contrary to the 
Camp David proposal to implement the autonomy all at once in 
Judaea and Samaria for all its inhabitants. I suppose the 
decision to apply autonomy to the Palestinian inhabitants 
referred to Palestinians who either belonged to the PLO or to 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. There are no other 
Palestinians." 
  "We will establish the most logical possible autonomy. I 
would like to say that we want this autonomy to work. Just as 
one may buy a ticket to get on a bus, one may travel abroad with 
a passport; there is no difference. If somebody wants to write 
a letter, there are more stamps in the world than countries. 
The stamps and the passports will bear either of the following 
inscriptions: /The Palestinian Authority/ or /The Palestinian 
Interim Self-Government Authority/. This will explicitly 
differentiate them from a state." 
  "The terms full autonomy and strong police force were coined 
by the Likud. /Self-government authority/ denotes full 
autonomy, not a state. If you want to call it a state, be my 
guests. The head of this /authority/ will not be called the 
president of a Palestinian state, as he is being called, but 
head of the /Palestinian Authority/. Autonomy means self-rule 
and it can be interpreted in various ways. The autonomy applies 
to everything except two issues; it gives the Palestinians full 
self-government except for two issues: security and external 
relations." 
  "We are carrying out a policy, without which the Jewish 
people would have faced a catastrophe and 20 years of 
procrastination." This latter remark triggers a commotion in the 
Likud's ranks, especially on the part of Yitzhaq Shamir, to whom 
Peres retorts: "You met with 'Abd-al-Shafi, the deputy founder 
of the PLO. You were the first one who spoke publicly with the 
PLO; you agreed to an international conference." "It was us, 
not you, who excluded Jerusalem from the autonomy. Shamir was 
prepared to wait another 20 years, which would have resulted in 
more hatred, more poverty, more victims, more acrimony, more 
knives. These were your prospects." Peres goes on to say that 
"most Israelis favor this move. Most people believe this is a 
courageous, genuine, and correct step. The fact that you ran 
out of gas and have no plan is your problem, not the people's." 
  "We are the only ones who pulled the country out of a deep 
freeze. People are delighted to see an Israeli delegation 
headed by the director general of the Defense Ministry in Qatar, 
Oman, Algeria, or Cairo, and to see us headed along a path of 
peace with the Palestinians." 
  Asked by an unidentified Knesset member whether he can give 
his commitment that there will be no Palestinian state, the 
foreign minister says: "I can commit myself to the fact that we 
are opposed to a Palestinian state and favor full autonomy, as 
we promised. Through the establishment of autonomy we prevented 
the establishment of a Palestinian state, because the 
alternative to autonomy is a Palestinian state." 
  "It is an illusion to believe that the problem is only one 
of 
borders. The problem is of borders, but also of relations. It 
is an illusion to think that terror can be cracked with jails 
and military operations. Terror must be uprooted through 
political means as well. Had relations in Hebron been 
different, the existence of a Jewish settlement there would have 
been no problem." 
  "The Revisionist Movement and the Labor Movement had both 
hoped for a totally different relationship between Jews and 
Arabs." "How can there be a relationship with 100,000 people 
having spent time in Israeli jails, 20,000 people having been 
injured, and 1,000 killed? Is that what you want? Is this the 
only way?" Turning to the opposition, Peres says: "Where are 
your ideology and your values? Where are your efforts to 
improve relations with the Palestinians and the Arabs, not 
because we fear them but on the basis of our own Jewish values?" 
"The Jewish state is a state of values. We will allow the 
Palestinians to travel as human beings with their own passports, 
to send letters to Arab countries with which we have no 
relations. They have the right to write letters, not in an 
environment of hatred and a feeling of superiority. If somebody 
in Gaza writes a letter, say to a relative in Iraq, does that 
mean that he founded a state?" 
  "We will not be deterred. We are flying a moral flag, not 
just a political one. We do not want to rule over another 
people, oppress it, or put it in jail. With murderers we will 
settle scores, while we will let ordinary people live with 
dignity. Therefore, the Knesset elections, public opinion 
polls, and even the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange show that we are on 
the right track." 
  "The leader of the Likud shamelessly appeared in a news 
conference and said: What we told you, that the prime minister 
had presented maps, is true. I hereby announce: The prime 
minister did not present even one map or any geographical lines 
to Christopher. I demand that the leader of the Likud come to 
this podium and apologize for spreading such lies." "The Labor 
party, the current coalition, the Israeli Government, and the 
prime minister publicly announced that we were in favor of a 
territorial compromise on the Golan Heights. We did not deny 
it, and we adhere to it. We did not give any maps. We will 
conduct negotiations because we want to attain peace with Syria, 
because we do not want to face a coalition with a totally 
different kind of weapons, because we must think about the 
future and not just about the past, because the future does not 
only herald knives but also missiles, because the future also 
holds nonconventional weapons, and because we must build a 
different future." 
  Again to the opposition, he says: "You will not frighten us 
even one little bit with your screams and threats. We are 
treading the only correct historical, political, strategic, and 
moral path. You know this deep down in your heart, and many of 
you support it." 
  "What we proposed to the Syrians is to conduct negotiations 
based on Israel's acceptance of the principle of territorial 
compromise and its wish to discuss one package encompassing 
withdrawal, peace, and security -- because these are three 
inseparable issues -- while cautiously weighing our 
pronouncements and our presentation of the issue. I hereby 
announce from this podium: This government will do what it 
promised and will strive to attain genuine peace with the 
Syrians, which will include an element of withdrawal. We will 
not present any maps before we know what the other components 
are and before we see that a spirit of reconciliation and 
willingness to arrive at a compromise exist on the Syrian side. 
They are not doing us a favor, and we are not doing them one. 
But, just as with the Palestinians, there are rules, and where 
security was concerned, we insisted on our position throughout 
the negotiations. On other issues, we tried to enable the 
Palestinians to live dignified lives as human beings; with 
passports, the right to write letters, self-government, and a 
police force." 
  Peres goes on to quote Israeli Army reservists: "For 27 
years we were sitting ducks in the Gaza Strip, and now we are 
getting out of it. Shalom to Gaza and Shalom to Israel, and let 
us turn over a new leaf." 
  "The words traitor, liar, and others were uttered even at 
the 
time of the Camp David accords. There were stones, and flags, 
and demonstrations. The man who brought about the Camp David 
accords, Begin, deserves all the historical praise. He was not 
deterred by people calling him a traitor or the shouting of 
Knesset Member Tzahi Hanegbi." 
  Peres ends his speech by saying: "A historic decision 
entails pains, opposition, and screams. The decision has been 
made. We are about to embark on the only correct road and I 
propose to strike all the no-confidence motions from the 
Knesset's agenda." 
  Replying to an interjection by the Likud's Binyamin Begin 
citing press reports that the autonomy agreement is based on an 
agreement made by Denmark with some islands near Greenland, 
Peres says: "Any comparison with the autonomy that had been 
proposed by the Likud or any other autonomy in the world is 
totally unfounded, because in Greenland or elsewhere it was 
stipulated that the autonomy would be a permanent form of 
relations, whereas the Camp David accords stipulated that the 
autonomy would be a temporary form of relations, which would 
move on to a permanent arrangement within five years. Therefore, 
there is a huge difference and no comparison should be made to 
anything. Hence, all reports on the matter are totally 
worthless. 
  "Secondly, it is true that Gaza is not Greenland. So, what 
to do? Hold onto 800,000 people with jail wardens, soldiers, 
policemen, stones, and knives? For God's sake, what is your 
solution? Stop confusing the people! You offer no solution, 
other than using force, violence, and confrontation." He 
concludes by saying: "Knives can always be matched with knives, 
but the desire of one people to run its own life must be met by 
political and moral means -- and we are providing both."

  [Text] Economy and Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit has 
reservations about the agreement to be signed between Israel and 
the PLO, and says it has components which do not conform with 
the opposition to the development of a Palestinian state, to 
which labor had made a commitment. 
  Minister Shetrit has misgivings about Israel's agreement to 
permit the Palestinians to issue their own passports and stamps. 
He also opposes the ambiguity of the agreement and criticizes 
the fact that no date has been fixed for the annulment of the 
Palestinian National Covenant.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur by </F>
Amnon Levi in the Jerusalem studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Levi] Deputy Minister Gur, you participated in 
the discussions U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held 
here today. We heard Syrian Foreign Minister al-Shar's public 
statement yesterday that the Israeli offer is silly. We heard 
the outright public rejection. Did you hear anything in today's 
talks which sheds more light on the Syrian reply? 
  [Gur] Naturally, the style was completely different. The 
phrase silly plan was not even on the agenda. The talks are 
serious. We cannot speak of a breakthrough, but we are trying 
very hard to find the way to a breakthrough. I hope we will 
succeed. 
  [Levi] Christopher said that the negotiations have entered a 
new and substantive level, while you say that there was no 
breakthrough. How is the situation different, then? 
  [Gur] We must first remember that the U.S. secretary of 
state spent many hours discussing with the Syrian president, 
something we, certainly I, did not. It may be that following 
his talks with the Syrian president, the secretary received the 
impression that there is a different tune. Judging from our 
conclusions, however, I can say that the conditions which would 
enable us to say that we can enter a much more serious stage of 
negotiations have not yet been created . 
  [Levi] Did the Syrians make a counterproposal? 
  [Gur] As far as I know, the Syrians are not ready yet to 
discuss any issue in detail -- neither territory nor the nature 
of peace. They have a single position, which is total, 
sweeping, and therefore cannot serve as an opening or a basis 
for the continuation of the negotiations. We try to maneuver 
because we attribute great importance to the continuation of the 
peace process. Naturally, we will not maneuver beyond the 
issues pertaining to Israel's security. 
  [Levi] By saying that the Syrians have a single stand, do 
you mean their demand that Israel immediately state that it is 
willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights in one fell swoop? 
  [Gur] In essence, what you said is correct. I would not 
want to be misquoted when I repeat Syrian remarks, but the idea 
is this: There is nothing to talk about before Israel announces 
unequivocally that it is withdrawing from the entire Golan 
Heights. No other issue can be discussed before this happens. 
Naturally, we cannot accept such an attitude. We care about 
the distant future, not just our immediate future, but also the 
future of our children and grandchildren. Unless we know what 
we are actually talking about, it would be very hard to make 
progress in the negotiations. Hence, we need patience, 
endurance, and a willingness to make progress. 
  [Levi] Qol Yisra'el reported this afternoon that, citing 
al-Asad, Christopher said Syria is willing to go into detail 
regarding the components of normalization with us, which is new. 
He also said that al-Asad would be willing to consider Israel's 
security needs, vague as this may sound. 
  [Gur] That is possible. I agree with you that this sounds a 
bit vague. I would use almost the same words, if I were asked. 
That is why this is absolutely insufficient. We cannot plan our 
life based on hints, allegations, or obscure plans. We want to 
hear clear things; then we will make our clear remarks. 
  [Levi] Regarding normalization, can you confirm the report I 
mentioned before? 
  [Gur] I cannot confirm any report. I can only speak of what 
we know is a basis for making decisions. I must point out with 
regret that the Syrian stand has not changed to the extent that 
would call for a change of the fundamental decisionmaking 
concepts because we will not compromise Israel's security. 
  [Levi] We spoke of the willingness to recognize Israel's 
security needs, and you said it is vague. Was the idea that 
keeps coming up regarding the demilitarization of the Golan 
Heights discussed this time? Is there any agreement on this? 
  [Gur] The issue may have been raised in the discussion 
between them. We have not reached this stage yet. We are not 
discussing it because we have not heard an initial Syrian 
declaration regarding the nature and essence of peace, or that 
we can talk about this. I hope that, as a result of the U.S. 
efforts, the Syrian president will indeed reach the stage in 
which he himself states his position -- not through the mouths 
of others -- and say he regards peace as a comprehensive, 
long-term peace. Then, we will be able to begin detailed 
negotiations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A short while ago, the Knesset defeated the three 
motions of no confidence in the government submitted by the 
opposition. A majority of 52 members of the coalition voted 
against the motions, while 41 members of the opposition voted 
for them. 
  Knesset Member [MK] 'Azran of SHAS [Torah Observing 
Sephardim] abstained. Before the vote took place, Moledet MK's 
Ze'evi and Ba'gad raised black umbrellas, pointed them at 
Foreign Minister Peres, and chanted Chamberlain, Chamberlain. 
They were removed from the plenum upon the order of the Knesset 
speaker, but were allowed to return for the vote.

    [Editorial Report] The 1 May editions of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ 
and Tel Aviv HATZOFE, both in Hebrew, carry contrasting 
editorials on the agreement signed in Cairo on 28 April. 
  The 800-word editorial on page B1 of HA'ARETZ, entitled 
"Removing the Obstacles," attributes the Cairo agreement "mainly 
to the prime minister's decision that the time has come to put 
an end to the recurring complications." The editorial goes on 
to say that it will be "impossible to divest the autonomy of its 
symbols," such as passports and stamps, "when it is applied to 
all the occupied territories, and the self-rule is bound to be 
recognized as a stage en route to full Palestinian independence." 
  Referring to the economic agreement signed in Paris on 29 
April, the editorial notes that "it reflects the premise that 
the State of Israel and the Palestinian self-rule have a de 
facto equal standing." 
  The editorial concludes: None of the agreements should be 
seen as undermining Israel. Rather, they are a vehicle that 
will result in a stronger Israel. Nothing can fortify its 
security better than peace with the Palestinians and the Arab 
countries." 
  The 1,100-word page 2 HATZOFE editorial, entitled "The 
Document of Capitulation," states: "Israel has surrendered 
every principle to which it adhered in the course of the 
protracted talks with the PLO." "Only a blind man can still 
insist that the agreement deals with `autonomy' in the spirit of 
the `Camp David' accords. No one with eyes in his head can 
ignore the government's policy of capitulation. Not only is 
this policy incapable of promoting peace in the region, on the 
contrary, there is every sign that we are witnessing the 
establishment of `a terrorist state' that will permanently 
threaten Israel's well-being and security." 
  HATZOFE maintains that in view of the agreement, "it is 
one's 
duty to rally in a bid to prevent at the last moment the 
disgraceful capitulation which has no equal anywhere in the 
world." "Since the `capitulation agreement' contravenes the 
Oslo agreement, the prime minister is duty bound to submit the 
document again for the Knesset's approval. He must present both 
the open and clandestine documents, to enable the people's 
representatives to judge whether they support the capitulation 
agreement. 
  "And as is well known, the majority of the Knesset members 
do 
not support the establishment of a Palestinian-PLO state in 
Eretz Yisra'el. The Jewish majority opposes capitulation." 
  The editorial further argues: "The forced Knesset majority 
supposedly supporting the left-wing government represents a 
popular minority. Therefore, the government has no mandate to 
decide on issues fateful for the people and the State of Israel. 
  "And if the prime minister does not understand this, the 
people must bravely make themselves heard, in order to force 
Rabin to resign and to make way for a national Jewish government 
capable of safeguarding the Jewish people's right to Eretz 
Yisra'el and of protecting the well-being and security of the 
State of Israel. 
  "The perils, as we said, are great. We must not keep silent. 
Everything must be done to prevent the signing of the `agreement 
of capitulation' to the PLO. 
  It is time to act!"

<F P=106> [From the "Week" column by 'Uzi Benziman: "Departure From </F>
Oslo"] 
  [Text] An interesting -- some may say precarious -- trend 
has emerged in Jerusalem policy-making bureaus with regard to 
the Oslo agreements; it implies a departure from these 
agreements. The new inclination is tacit, for the time being, 
and no one will publicly admit it, but it is not one man's 
domain. It is embraced by power centers at the Foreign Ministry 
and, to a certain extent, by top IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
echelons. It has not taken root at the prime minister's bureau 
yet, but experience shows that things which start brewing at the 
Foreign Ministry never fail to touch Yitzhaq Rabin eventually. 
  Both the IDF and the Foreign Ministry would like to deviate 
from the Oslo agreement timetables and move on at once (after 
the agreement on the Gaza and Jericho withdrawal is signed) to 
talks on the permanent arrangements. In both bodies, the 
prevailing opinion is that adherence to the staged 
implementation principle will generate a prolonged period of 
terror that would best be skipped or reduced. It is believed 
that when the PLO takes over in Gaza and Jericho, it will try to 
curb terrorism in these districts and prevent terrorist attacks 
in the Jewish enclaves under its rule. Yet it is clear to all 
those who are involved in the negotiations that terror will 
continue in the West Bank and inside the Green Line and that the 
PLO will not go out of its way to prevent it. From 'Arafat's 
point of view, continued terror spurs Israel to concessions and 
makes territorial occupation abhorrent to it. 
  In view of these assessments, very senior IDF and Foreign 
Ministry officials are saying that it would be preferable to 
forgo negotiations on the West Bank autonomy (following the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement) and broach the 
permanent arrangement issue at once. There is another, more 
moderate alternative: No official declaration concerning the 
dissolution of the negotiations on the interim stage of West 
Bank self-rule will be made. Rather, the interim stage will be 
imbued with permanent arrangement contents. 
  Meanwhile, a proposal for an even more far-reaching course 
of 
action has evolved at the Foreign Ministry: Other central 
components of the Oslo agreements should be abandoned on the 
pretext that the experience amassed since September 1993 
requires that new lessons be learned and basic premises be 
updated. This theory contends not only that the second stage -- 
that of the establishment of interim self-rule -- is superfluous 
and cumbersome, but also that Israel should dispense with the 
axiom that it will not disband settlements. The grounds for 
this doctrine are as follow: Israel scored "superfluous 
achievements" in Oslo. It demanded and received a five-year 
interim period, which today seems an undesirable station along 
the road. Furthermore, it has obtained the PLO's consent to all 
the Israeli settlements' remaining intact, although the truth of 
the matter is that there are quite a few settlers who would 
rather return home to inside the Green Line. 
  The same applies to the fate of entire settlements that are 
isolated (such as Netzarim and Kfar Darom), which are being kept 
in place only because of the principle signed in Oslo, although 
all the Jerusalem policymakers agree that they are nothing but a 
nuisance. Why, then, should Israel zealously insist on each 
clause of the agreements, when the new reality suggests that 
certain clauses should be amended or waived? The promoters of 
this approach note, in addition, that under the interim stage 
clauses of the Oslo agreements, the IDF will have to evacuate 
the centers of West Bank cities. They wonder how this clause 
can be implemented as long as the Jewish islands in the heart of 
Hebron (and in Nabulus: the Joseph's Tomb yeshiva, for 
instance) are kept in place. 
  The one man who does not share this perception (for the 
moment?) is Yitzhaq Rabin. The prime minister has developed an 
obstinate -- some say "square" -- adherence to the Oslo 
agreements, from which he refuses to budge. He wants to see how 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement is implemented, and only on the basis 
of lessons learned from this experience will he approach the 
next stage of the agreements. The message he is conveying is 
that he cannot imagine reneging on the commitment that no 
settlements will be disbanded during the interim period. For 
Rabin, keeping his promises is the supreme test of his personal 
credibility and, therefore, of his ability to retain his main 
electoral asset: the public's trust. In the coming days, Rabin 
is liable to find himself in a complicated situation in which 
the question will again arise: To what extent is he steering 
the course of events and to what extent are events controlling 
him?

<F P=106> [Commentary by David Pedatzur: "A Creeping Devaluation on </F>
the Golan"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the talks or negotiations 
leading to negotiations with Syria, Syria is digging in its 
heels while Israel is stripping itself of all its assets, 
leaving very little for the U.S. "honest brokerage" and for the 
actual negotiations. On the eve of his current Middle East 
tour, the U.S. secretary of state made an effort to lower 
expectations of "dramatic breakthroughs." Speaking on the U.S. 
Information Service's Internet at a news conference attended by 
newsmen from Oman, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, and Jerusalem, 
Christopher described his visit as "routine." According to him, 
he is not carrying any "package," but he hopes to bring the 
Syrian president "certain interesting information" from 
Jerusalem. 
  It is doubtful that there is still any "interesting 
information" left in Jerusalem that the Syrians do not know 
about. Al-Asad is determined not to give up on a single inch of 
the Golan, while Israel is crawling its way down from the Golan. 
Looking back, one cannot help but wonder at the excessive 
Israeli optimism that followed al-Asad's declaration about his 
willingness to make peace with Israel. We have been informed of 
countless instances of "sensational progress," just plain 
"progress," and "breakthroughs" since we began making progress 
on the withdrawal. 
  The prime minister must have had very good reason for his 
declaration regarding his willingness to evacuate settlements on 
the Golan in return for peace. Yet Israel's lowering of the 
concession barrier does not follow any moderation in the Syrian 
stands. After all, Rabin himself stated more than once that 
"Syria has not made a single gesture to build confidence." Ever 
since al-Asad made his forced and stuttering remark after his 
meeting with Clinton in Geneva, Rabin has been waiting for the 
Syrian president to make another move; he never did. What else 
should Israel say that it has not yet openly said to make 
al-Asad kindly take the Golan Heights back? 
  It is very easy to argue with Rabin and quote the 
unequivocal 
statements he made prior to the elections regarding the future 
of the Golan. Nevertheless, ever since he assumed office, there 
has been a troubling erosion in the prime minister's statements. 
It is true that Rabin never said that the Golan Heights is an 
inseparable part of the State of Israel. He relies on the Labor 
platform and the willingness to make territorial concessions, 
including on the Golan. Territorial compromise could amount to 
evacuating settlements, but it should in no way be taken to mean 
total withdrawal from the Golan and uprooting all the 
settlements. [passage omitted] 
  Nonetheless, if the prime minister contends that his remarks 
about the Golan withdrawal and settlement evacuation were not 
made in order to exact a reciprocal Syrian gesture, who needed 
them and why were they made? The chilly reactions of the Syrian 
media left no room for doubt that Syria is not only demanding 
that all the settlements be dismantled but also that Israel 
fully withdraw from all of the territories, including Jerusalem 
-- which has been the Syrian stand since al-Asad assumed power. 
Reacting to Rabin's remarks on the readiness to evacuate 
settlements, TISHRIN said he is "throwing sand in our eyes." 
The Syrian press believes that what is needed now is U.S. 
pressure on Israel. 
  In practice, the Israeli Government is fulfilling the 
commitment undertaken in the Labor platform that "efforts to 
bolster the existing settlements on the Golan Heights will 
continue." On one hand, it is "business as usual": accelerated 
development is taking place and investments are being made in 
every field, with the exception of tourism, including the 
construction of "the largest cowshed in the Middle East." On 
the other hand, every unnecessary Israeli declaration weakens 
the settlers' endurance and makes them feel that, sooner or 
later, everything will be dismantled or destroyed -- if not in 
one blow, then in stages. 
  In the current Knesset, the government lacks majority 
support 
for a full withdrawal from the Golan and the evacuation of all 
the settlements there, even in exchange for full peace with 
Syria. The results of the referendum, the circumstances under 
which it will be held, and the contents of the "peace package" 
are unknown. Public opinion polls do not fully answer the 
question of whether the people are with the Golan or with peace 
without the Golan. Either way, even if there were no Israeli 
settlements on the Golan, there is doubt about whether a 
government decision on a full withdrawal would be widely 
accepted. Even in the absence of settlements on the Golan, the 
security consideration must lead the government to ensure that 
the Golan Heights will never again become a launching pad for 
attacks on the Galilee and Jordan Rift Valley settlements. Even 
if there were no settlements on the Golan and even if Syria were 
willing to sign a peace treaty with Israel, Syrian intentions 
would have to be tested over a period of 10-20 years before 
executing a full withdrawal from which there is no return. 
  After all, there is nothing new in the Syrian bazaar: He who 
is patient wins; he who is in a rush loses. Even if it was not 
about security and dangerously betting on our future, the 
Israeli dealer must show the same amount of patience 
demonstrated by the Syrian merchant.

<F P=106> [Report by Nisim Qeynan] </F>
  [Text] It has just been released for publication that 
shots were fired at an IDF [Israel Defense Sources] patrol in 
the southeastern corner of the Qatif Bloc settlement of Ganey 
Tal at about 0620 this morning. Four soldiers were wounded in 
the incident. As a result of the gunfire, the patrol driver 
lost control of the vehicle, which overturned and plummeted 
about 10 meters down a sand dune. An Army helicopter evacuated 
the wounded to the hospital. Two of the men, who suffered 
moderate injuries, apparently caused by the gunfire, were 
evacuated to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, while the other two, 
who sustained slight injuries, evidently as a result of the 
car's overturning, were moved to Barzilay Hospital in Ashqelon. 
  It has been further learned that the gunshots came from a 
two-story house on the outskirts of Khan Yunus, whose Amal 
neighborhood borders on Ganey Tal. The house has been known to 
serve as a terrorist hideout and observation post in the past. 
  The IDF and the security forces have mounted a manhunt for 
the terrorists, who fled the house. No arrests have been made. 
The number of assailants is unknown, although an initial 
debriefing indicates that the shots came from at least two 
firearms.

<F P=106> [Report by Arye Arad] </F>
  [Excerpt] Twice over the past two days, the government has 
issued seemingly routine announcements that create the 
impression that Israel is sending a message to Syria regarding 
the future of the Golan Heights. 
  Two days ago, the Public Works Department announced that it 
will invest 2.5 million shekels in building a new road between 
Ramat Magshimim and Nator. Yesterday, Transportation Minister 
Yisra'el Qeysar announced that he is allocating 750,000 shekels 
to solve transportation problems on the Golan. He made the 
promise in a meeting with the heads of the Golan Regional 
Council. The current sum is earmarked for works within the 
Jewish settlements, but Minister Qeysar promised that the 
government will also invest in improving existing roads and 
building new ones for the Druze on the Golan. There are 
currently 18,000 Druze and 12,000 Jewish residents on the Golan.

<F P=106> [Report by Ilana Baum] </F>
  [Text] The Construction and Housing Ministry yesterday 
issued a tender via the Public Works Division for the 
construction of the "Jericho bypass" road. 
  It will be the first of a series of "security roads" to be 
built by Israel to avoid friction between Israelis and 
Palestinians and to increase security for the Jewish settlers in 
Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, approved 
the building of the new road. The length of the "Jericho 
bypass" road will be 13 km and it will cost 5 million shekels. 
It is a ring road which will be built some 2 km south of 
Jericho. 
  The work will begin within a month and will end within weeks 
after that. 
  About three months ago, the Construction and Housing 
Ministry 
prepared a master plan for the "autonomy roads," which will cost 
a total of 2 billion shekels. 
  They will involve the building of some 600 km of roads in 
Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The plan, which is defined 
as top secret, categorizes the importance and urgency of each 
road. 
  The "Jericho bypass" road was defined as having immediate 
urgency. 
  The plan was presented for Defense Ministry inspection and 
Yitzhaq Rabin's approval. No permission has yet been given for 
the building of additional roads. 
  The autonomy road plan has two tracks: 
  One: restoring, expanding, and adding new lanes to existing 
strategic roads, such as the Jordan Rift Valley road, the Alon 
Road, and the Trans-Samaria Highway. 
  Two: building new roads, called "security roads" with the 
aim of assuring the safety of the Jewish residents. These are 
bypass roads, such as the "Jericho bypass" road. 
  The aim of the security roads is to bypass Arab population 
centers and prevent friction between Jews and Arabs. Under this 
clause, additional roads are planned: the Ramallah bypass, the 
Nabulus bypass, the Tulkarm bypass, and the Shomron bypass.

<F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Zrahya] </F>
  [Text] Most of the economic indicators for January-March 
1994 point to an expansion of economic activity conforming with 
the annual forecast, according to a survey of developments in 
the economy published yesterday by Tzipi Gal-Yam, the Treasury's 
economic adviser. 
  The data does not reflect the impact of the closure on the 
territories, and the Treasury says it is still too early to 
discern its impact. 
  The survey notes that in the first quarter of 1994 the 
number 
of jobless dropped by 23 percent compared to the same period 
last year, and that there was an increase of 28 percent in 
tourism, and 12 percent in state revenues from taxes. Retail 
trade went up 15 percent and imports of consumer goods by 18 
percent. 
  In the first quarter of 1994, there was a 22 percent 
increase 
in the import of investment assets compared to the same period 
last year, as well as in the import of raw materials, and a 
growth of 5.4 percent in the export of goods. 
  The index went up higher than anticipated in January-March, 
but it is still lower than the same period over the past two 
years. 
  The Treasury noted that it is still too early to decide if 
the economy has exceeded its aim of 8 percent inflation this 
year. 
  It was also said that there is stability in the financial 
markets and that they have even shrunk following a bullish 
period in the stock exchange in the last quarter of 1993.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
'Imanu'el Rosen, in the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Rosen] Although we all have short memories, I 
remember that at the end of the 1980's, when you served as the 
Foreign Ministry's political director general, you suggested 
that we hold a dialogue and contacts with Mandela and the ANC. 
Then Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was very mad at you for 
this. 
  [Beilin] Well, yes, but he has changed his mind since. 
Also, there were sanctions against South Africa, and Israel was 
not too enthusiastic about taking steps against South Africa. 
Eventually, in March 1987 we joined the international club that 
imposed the sanctions, and I was very happy with this. I 
believe this is one of the reasons that today we are able to 
hold a dialogue, as we do, with Nelson Mandela, who was then 
still in prison, and with the ANC. 
  [Rosen] Do you believe that over the past two or three years 
we corrected the mistakes made over the past decades? 
  [Beilin] I believe so because up to 1987, Israel was, in 
fact, the only country to openly admit that it disregarded the 
sanctions the United Nations imposed on South Africa in 1977. 
This created a very negative sentiment against Israel among the 
black South Africans. They seriously supported the 
Palestinians, hence, their unbalanced attitude toward the PLO 
all these years. It was very difficult for us to make the 
change, and I cannot say that today they are completely balanced 
and that we will continue our passionate love affair with South 
Africa. The new regime will certainly be different from the 
previous, very pro-Israel, white regime. 
  [Rosen] We had very good defense relations. Was this 
eliminated? 
  [Beilin] In 1987 we decided not to renew defense contracts. 
That meant that existing contracts which still were in effect 
were followed through to the date set for their termination. No 
new contracts were signed. Therefore, the defense relations 
between us have completely decayed. 
  [Rosen] Are there other areas of cooperation which will 
continue? Are there contacts now with Mandela's men on this? 
  [Beilin] Primarily, there is trade between the two 
countries. We import coal and other raw materials, and we export 
there. We naturally have very close ties with the Jewish 
community there. Also, there are contacts, established about a 
year ago or so, with the ANC, which is a very broad coalition, 
and with Mandela. He was due to visit Israel some time ago, and 
he postponed it and will probably visit here in the future. 
Hence, certainly we have the beginning of a very interesting 
dialogue, which carries many opportunities, with the new South 
African leadership. 
  [Rosen] Is there a possibility of an Israeli-South African 
cooperation regarding black Africa in general? 
  [Beilin] We have asked ourselves this very question, though 
I doubt it is possible. There is a big question: What kind of 
country will South African become? So far, it has been a 
Western country with a black population that could not even 
vote. Today, it will be very different. Will it become another 
Third World country with the symptoms of such countries, 
including the big disappointment with past African leaders; or 
will it be a very different country, which uses the enormous 
wealth at its disposal? There is a chance the latter will be the 
case, but I find it hard to believe it will have the time or the 
ability to even consider cooperating with a country such as 
Israel in other Third World countries or black Africa. We will 
continue our efforts in Africa. We are in the midst of a very 
intensive campaign of economic cooperation with African 
countries. If the new South African regime would be willing to 
cooperate with us, we would certainly welcome this. I, however, 
doubt this is a realistic option at this time. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jordanian political parties and national forces 
have set up a popular committee to counter agreements of 
capitulation and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The 
provisional administrative body of the committee has called a 
meeting for 1800 on Thursday, 5 May, 1994, to ratify the bylaws 
and obtain official registration. 
  Following is the text of the committee's bylaws: 
  At this stage, the Arab world, as well as Jordan, is being 
targeted by a ferocious U.S.- and Zionist-led imperialist 
offensive to consolidate the foundations of a Middle East order 
with the necessary mechanisms, as a counterbalance to a 
pan-Arab, democratic, revivalist strategy, by deepening the 
dependency of Arab regimes and by the recognition of and 
normalization with the Zionist enemy. 
  The Gaza-Jericho accord, the Jordanian-Israeli agenda, and 
the ongoing negotiations between the Zionist enemy and the Arab 
regimes are only the beginning of a plan to impose the so-called 
Middle East order. 
  First -- The Objective and Functions: 
  Based on the above, the Jordanian parties are setting up a 
committee to resist negotiations, hegemonic American-Israeli 
agreements, and political, economic, and cultural normalization 
with the Zionist enemy. The committee's work will aim for a 
dual function: 
  1. A determined stand against the hegemonic and normalizing 
effort in Jordan and its attendant results, particulary the call 
for a confederation grouping the Palestinians, Israel, and 
Jordan, as well as resistance to attempts to impose U.S.-Israeli 
economic dominance on Jordan so the country's political future 
is exposed to threat. 
  2. Laying bridges and forging coordination with all 
nationalist and democratic forces in the Arab and Muslim arenas 
that have rejected the hegemonic and normalizing agreements, 
above all the Palestinian forces that are taking a negative 
stand toward the Oslo and Cairo agreements and the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The aim is to uphold the historic, 
inalienable rights of the Arabs in Palestine, including the 
right to self-determination, repatriation, and statehood. 
  Second -- The Means: 
  To advance the goals and functions of the committee, the 
following activities are to be pursued, not excluding other 
approaches: 
  1. The publication of a monthly bulletin specialized in 
pointing out the dangers of the Zionist presence and exposing 
those who establish contacts with the Zionist enemy. The 
bulletin will have a cultural, political, and scientific 
orientation. 
  2. Organizing panel discussions, lectures, and rallies to 
point up the dangers of the Zionist presence and the risks to 
Jordan and the Arab nation that normaliztion carries. 
  3. The formation of popular bodies in Jordan to marshal 
public pressure to forestall any move to scrap or amend 
legislation barring dealings with the Zionist enemy in the 
political, economic, and cultural domains, or any other spheres, 
and to keep the boycott of Israel in place. 
  4. The formation of subcommittees of economic experts, 
businessmen, trade unionists, and professionals to combat the 
economic opening to the Zionist enemy, which is potentially 
detrimental to Jordan's industrial and agricultural sectors. 
The subcommittees should also resist dependency on the Zionist 
economy. 
  5. The formation of cultural subcommittees to counter and 
expose cultural normalization with the Zionist enemy in any 
shape of form and to block all channels to promote cultural 
penetration of our society, including any amendments to the 
school curricula to further the cause of cultural normalization 
with the enemy. 
  6. Any politician, merchant, intellectual, writer, unionist, 
or journalist who does business with Israelis must be isolated.

<F P=106> ["Jordanian Papers" column by Samih al-Ma'ayitah: "The </F>
Little High Commissioner"] 
  [Text] A few years ago, we used to write or talk about the 
PLO leadership with caution and care. We were afraid that our 
writing could be interpreted as promoting narrow regionalism and 
striking at Jordan's national unity. However, the road chosen 
by the PLO leadership, especially after it signed the Oslo 
accord with the Zionist enemy and its agreeing to an unequal 
alliance with the Zionist entity -- an alliance of service, 
exploitation, and relinquishment of most of the Palestinian 
territory and rights in return for a meager authority -- has 
stripped this leadership of its claim to be representing the 
Palestinian people. This leadership is now no more than a party 
that controls Palestinian decisonmaking. This is an established 
fact despite the recognition of this leadership by the majority 
of nations, because what is important is the extent of 
recognition and respect extended to this leadership by the 
Palestinian people, who adhere to their cause and rights. 
  I wrote this introduction to point to the high commissioner 
spirit displayed by some PLO leaders in their reaction to some 
local Jordanian developments and their provocative interference 
in Jordanian issues. Observe how Hakam Bal'awi a few weeks ago 
conveyed protests from his president against mosque preachers, 
the Jordanian press, and the activity of some people who oppose 
a Middle East peace settlement, such as the Hamas Movement and 
Hani al-Hasan. Mr. Bal'awi was not satisfied with direct 
protest. The PLO leadership has had recourse to the U.S. 
Administration and its ally, the Zionist enemy, to put pressure 
on Jordan. Thus, we heard Zionist threats against Jordan to 
stop the media and political activity of Hamas on its territory. 
  His excellency the Palestinian ambassador in Amman has also 
been doing the same thing for quite a while. He has interfered 
with some newspapers, threatened some writers, and tried to buy 
some others. All these practices are done in public. The most 
recent example of this is his protest against some of the 
writings of Khalid Mahadin about some PLO stands. This prompted 
the prime minister to order censoring the writings of Mahadin or 
preventing his writing. 
  The PLO leadership does not like to see Jordan lead a 
democratic life. It is unhappy with the freedom we are 
experiencing. We thank God that we are not among the subjects 
of Mr. 'Arafat and his democratic leadership. If this were the 
case, gallows would be erected and harsh sentences would be 
passed against whoever opens his mouth. We feel sorry for our 
brothers who will live in the Gaza-Jericho protectorate under 
the democracy of the PLO leadership. 
  The PLO leadership should stop interfering in Jordan's 
affairs and manifesting the spirit of the high commissioner in 
the way it deals with the Jordanian arena. This leadership does 
this because it feels that it is supported by the U.S. 
Administration and the Zionist enemy. This leadership has no 
right to set a ceiling to our democracy. We are more concerned 
about observing laws, regulations, and the Constitution and we 
will not exchange this ceiling for the whims and wishes of this 
leadership. 
  I reassert that we are talking here about a powerful faction 
of the PLO that is now linked strategically with the Zionist 
enemy and is conducting itself according to the enemy's desires 
and terms at the expense of the rights of the Palestinian people 
first and the rights and sovereignty of some Arab countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Credit Goes to the One Who Deserves It"] </F>
  [Text] What has made the brothers in Saudi Arabia involve 
themselves in the restoration of the Islamic places in the holy 
city these days, and to claim that the Kingdom is going ahead 
with its commitment to implement the project in cooperation with 
UNESCO. 
  Everyone knows that Jordan, and His Majesty King Husayn 
personally was the one who looked after, supervised, and 
financed the restoration of the holy places and the Dome of the 
Rock throughout the past decades. The celebrations held in 
Amman and Jerusalem a few days ago to mark this great 
achievement were evidence of this restoration, which is the 
third Hashemite restoration that was carried out with pure 
Jordanian planning, supervision, and financing. That effort was 
blessed by our people and all religious and popular 
establishments in Jerusalem and the whole of occupied Palestine. 
  While carrying out this noble duty, Jordan was showing 
commitment to historical and geographical responsibilities 
without reminding anyone of a favor or boasting about what it is 
doing. Jordan only seeks God's satisfaction and wants to serve 
and maintain the first of the two qiblas and the third holiest 
shrine. 
  The statement by the official Saudi source, claiming that 
Saudi Arabia is continuing its restoration of the holy places 
through UNESCO, can only be understood as arrogance, claiming 
the work of others, disregarding the efforts of others, and 
extreme ingratitude. 
  What is worse is that the Saudi official source insists on 
involving an international organization, that is UNESCO, in what 
he termed the project to restore the holy places, as if he wants 
to internationalize these shrines and put them under 
international control, ignoring that these shrines are Arab and 
Islamic, and sovereignty over them is only for Almighty God, as 
His Majesty King Husayn said. 
  His Majesty King Husayn has openly and loudly said: We are 
carrying out this duty in the name of the Islamic nation and on 
its behalf, and the path for the restoration of our shrines in 
Jerusalem is known -- it is the Jordanian Ministry of Awqaf and 
the Committee for the Restoration of al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of 
the Rock. 
  Neither UNESCO, nor any other international establishment or 
organization have any connection with the reconstruction and 
restoration because these activities are carried out by the 
Hashemites, who have jurisdiction and religious right, and who 
are--historically and geographically--the custodians of the 
Covenant of 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab. All allegations by any side 
will only bring regret to those who make them, and the credit 
will continue to be for the one who deserves it.

<F P=106> [Article by the political editor: "The Road to Jerusalem is </F>
Known"] 
  [Text] Saudi Arabia has said that it will go ahead with its 
commitment to renovate and restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome 
of the Rock through its existing contacts, continuous 
consultations, and strong cooperation with the UNESCO. 
  This was announced by an official Saudi source yesterday. 
These Saudi words, which are covered in the guise of Islam, 
smacks of an exposed and naive political game. One would ask: 
Why is there this sudden concern for Jerusalem and al-Aqsa 
after forgetting them for such a long time? Are the ones who 
allowed the invaders to encroach on Karbala' and al-Najaf from 
their land really concerned about al-Aqsa? 
  The file of al-Aqsa was overlooked by the Saudi brothers for 
many years, Jerusalem fell between their barrels of oil, 
forgotten at the bottom of a list of Saudi Arabia's priorities. 
What has changed? 
  The Saudi statement on the expansion work makes us wonder 
about the legitimacy of such a measure. The value of al-Aqsa 
lies in preserving it as it is through renovation and 
restoration, not through changing its features under the pretext 
of restoration and renovation. 
  Al-Aqsa must not be exploited for political oneupmanship, 
not 
through cooperation with UNESCO or coordination with OPEC. Out 
of our concern for the Saudi brothers, we call on them to review 
their ability in running the affairs of al-Ka'bah and the two 
holy mosques. 
  Jerusalem has its God and men; and the Hashemites are the 
ones who sacrifice their souls and money for al-Aqsa and its 
restoration. The address of the bodies in charge of restoring 
the holy places is well known -- they are the Jordanian Awqaf 
Ministry and the Committee in charge of restoring al-Aqsa Mosque 
and the Dome of the Rock.

  [Excerpt] Jordanian-Saudi relations, tense since the Gulf 
war, have witnessed yet another setback. In spite of some 
mediation attempts to reduce the tension, the Jordanian-Saudi 
relationship has now plummeted to an all-time low, especially in 
the wake of King Husayn's visit to the holy land to perform the 
minor pilgrimage. The surprise then was that Saudi officials did 
not observe the simplest rules of tact and protocol stipulated 
by international norms. 
  What happened last week was another negative incident that 
reflects a Saudi desire to escalate the official quarrel. Saudi 
Arabia has issued an official statement saying it is taking care 
of the reconstruction of holy sites through UNESCO. 
  The seriousness of this statement is that it came only hours 
after Jordan's grand, official celebration of the unveiling of 
the dome and a plaque that set 18 April, 1994 as the date the 
reconstruction of the Dome of the Rock was finished and the 
repair work on the Salah-al-Din pulpit, burned by the Zionists 
in 1968 when they burned the al-Aqsa Mosque, was begun. 
  Jordan chose not to reply officially to the Saudi statement, 
leaving facts on the ground to speak for themselves. Except for 
an editorial in a daily, all comments by Saudi media at home and 
abroad which elaborated on the Saudi official statement were 
absolutely ignored by Jordan. 
  As background to this incident, it should be mentioned that 
three years ago, UNESCO proposed a plan to refurbish the al-Aqsa 
Mosque, in coordination with Israel, since it is the occupying 
power that controls Palestinian land. Israel encouraged this 
step. Jordan, however, rejected this approach when it received 
a message, just like all other countries, to contribute to the 
reconstruction of the al-Aqsa Mosque. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Amman--The Jordanian National Front, which 
includes the Jordanian National Alliance Party, the Progress and 
Justice Party, al-Yaqazah Party, and al-Watan Party, have issued 
a political statement on the U.S. position and Christopher's 
tour. It says: 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher returned for a 
new 
tour of the Middle East after this region witnessed disgraceful 
events between his current and previous tour. We also believe 
he has no plan to end the region's grievances and sufferings, as 
well as Israel's terrorism and tyranny. 
  As an example, we would like to mention the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and the killing of innocent worshipers in the mosque by 
Israeli settlers, as well as the continued killing of the sons 
of the Palestinian people. The United Nations has condemned 
that terrorism and crime and stressed the need to find 
international protection for the Palestinians, but the United 
States voiced its biased reservations about some of the 
provisions. [passage omitted] 
  We also demand that the unjust blockade, which the United 
States has imposed on Iraq's people in order to plunder the oil 
wealth in the region, undeterred by law or conscience, be lifted. 
  Regarding Jordan, we can say that despite the statements the 
U.S. secretary of states made on several occasions that Jordan 
is a friendly country and maintains cordial relations with his 
country, the United States is still exercising, under UN cover, 
these cordial relations with a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, in 
order to maintain the interests of its servants in the Arab 
world and Israel and to harm Jordan's economic status. As some 
media organizations say, the United States is dissatisfied with 
democracy in Jordan because any attempt by neighboring Arab 
countries to follow suit will threaten its servants' regimes. 
Despite all this, the United States urges Jordan to continue 
peace talks with Israel under the usual U.S. sponsorship of 
peace conferences.

  [Text] Even with the fabricated atmosphere permeating 
Jordanian-U.S. meetings, and the less-than-warm statements about 
relations, the United States continues to harbor a grudge 
against Jordan and expresses dissatisfaction with its pan-Arab 
policy. The United States is also playing a decisive role in 
maintaining the estrangement between Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 
It wants to confuse Jordan's stands and to foil its initiatives 
and policies. 
  The reason for all this is that the United States still 
insists that Jordan supplied Iraq with information about 
coalition forces during the Gulf war and that it was, and still 
is, an outlet supplying Iraq with its needs, despite the unjust 
embargo. 
  The United States continues to tighten the siege on the Port 
of al-'Aqabah in order to cause more harm to the Jordanian 
economy, in retaliation for the Jordanian masses' stands in 
support of Iraq -- stands that continued to escalate and 
nurtured a sense of hostility in the Jordanian arena against the 
United States's positions. 
  Political analysts say that during every meeting with 
Jordan, 
the United States asks questions about the Gulf war, attempting 
to confirm its doubts and statements. By interfering in 
Jordan's relations with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, it tries 
to isolate Jordan and its positions from any Arab support. 
  Jordan has confirmed to the United States that these 
accusations are untrue and that its role during the Gulf was 
only a moral one. 
  The Israeli claim that Jordan accommodates Hamas leaders is 
the second stage of the U.S.-Israeli conspiracy aimed at 
creating a state of instability in Jordan. Jordan condemned 
such interference in its domestic affairs, saying it does not 
allow anyone to impose a mandate or a decision on it because 
this constitutes an encroachment on its sovereignty and violates 
its stands. 
  The Americans tried several times to twist Jordan's arm by 
various means of intimidation and temptation for the purpose of 
singling Jordan out. However, despite all its suffering, Jordan 
has rejected these demands and maintained its firm pan-Arab 
stand toward Palestine and the Gulf war.

  [Excerpt] Counterfeit, 1990-issue [U.S.] $100 bills have 
recently found their way onto the Jordanian market, according to 
money changer sources. The counterfeit bills are said to be as 
near perfect as the originals; the imitations can stand the test 
of x-ray detectors. The paper used in the imitations is said to 
be remarkably similar to authentic bills. 
  Money changers are advising members of the general public 
against accepting 1990-issue $100 bills from suspect sources 
before subjecting it to thorough inspection. The counterfeit 
banknotes bear distinctive marks setting them apart from the 
genuine $100 bills. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister has said the government is 
committed to establish a society free of exploitation and 
eliminate differences between rural and urban areas in the 
country. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto was addressing a huge public meeting in 
Qila Didar Singh this after formally inaugurating the wheat 
harvesting campaign in Gujranwala District. The meeting was 
attended, among others, by the Punjab governor, Chaudhary 
Mohammad Altaf Hussain; Chief Minister Mian Manzoor Ahmad Watto; 
Federal Ministers Mr. Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal and Nawab 
Mohammad Yusuf Talpur; provincial ministers; members of 
parliament; and notables of the area. The prime minister said 
the government had allocated huge amounts in the budget for 
development of the country and to raise the standard of living 
of the common man. She said the government has increased the 
support price of wheat when the crop has not been reaped as yet. 
As a result of this, the whole benefit of price increase will 
go to the farmers. 
  Earlier, addressing a gathering after inauguration of Sui 
gas 
supply and digital telephone exchange at Malikwal near Mandi 
Bahauddin, the prime minister said the government is introducing 
economic, industrial, and social reforms to solve the problems 
of the people. She said the government is taking steps to make 
the country self-sufficient in food grains. The prime minister 
said Pakistan will continue to support Kashmiri people in their 
just struggle for their right of self-determination. She said 
Pakistan believes in supporting all struggles of the people for 
freedom. She said no power can deny the Kashmiris their right. 
The prime minister announced that an industrial estate will be 
set up Mandi Bahauddin. 
  Later, talking to newsmen in Badshahpur near Mandi 
Bahauddin, 
the prime minister said the government will fully protect the 
life and property of the people and not tolerate any violence. 
The prime minister deplored the fresh wave of violence in 
Karachi which has claimed several previous lives and left many 
injured. She observed that fresh violence had started after the 
visit of the opposition leader, Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, and 
regretted that the MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] leader was 
issuing instructions for disturbances while sitting in London. 
She said if Murtaza Bhutto has to confront charges despite 
being her own brother, why cannot Altaf Hussain come back and do 
the same. She said in 1989 also her government tried to 
accommodate MQM but in vain. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said there are 
forces which do not want to see Pakistan progressing, but her 
government would continue its peace efforts. About the victims 
recent sniper firing, she said government would compensate them 
and register cases against law breakers.

  [Text] Normal life in Karachi remained affected today. 
Reports of sporadic incidents of shooting and arson have been 
received from various areas of Karachi East and the central 
district. The troublemakers set at least six vehicles on fire, 
damaging them. According to PPI, a press note issued in Karachi 
says eight people sustained bullet wounds; two of them 
subsequently died. Many business centers and industrial 
establishments were closed. Traffic was light, particularly in 
the central and eastern districts. The press note says the 
situation was brought under control with the help of the rangers 
and the police. Some arrests have been made, and the police 
have registered cases and started investigations. 
  The district magistrate of Karachi South has enforced 
Section 
144 [banning assembly of more than five persons] throughout the 
district. There have also been some incidents of violence and 
disruption of law and order in Hyderabad. 
  In Karachi, a spokesman of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP] 
appealed to the civilian population of the Sindh to resolve the 
situation and support the provincial government in its attempts 
to eliminate terrorism, so that peace is restored to the Sindh 
and hatred eliminated. He said the negative politics of the 
Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM] has created enmity between itself 
and other communities, causing serious damage to the Muhajirs, 
besides creating serious economic difficulties for the residents 
of Karachi and Hyderabad. The people want to eliminate these 
problems. 
  The spokesman said the Army operation was started not by the 
PPP but by the previous government. He said the terrorism to 
which MQM leader Altaf Hussain is referring is of his own 
creation and he should clear the charges against him in court. 
The spokesman added that the Nawaz Sharif government and not 
the PPP government is responsible for the excesses mentioned by 
Altaf Hussain.

matters relating to the F-16 deal aree not settled with the 
United States, the world market is open for Pakistan to purchase 
other planes. Talking to newsmen at Larkana, he said Pakistan 
will not accept any condition in this deal that is against its 
national interests because there are other things more important 
than F-16's. Negotiations, however, are in progress. 
  When asked about occupied Kashmir, the defense minister 
spoke 
of the heavy deployment of Indian forces there. He said, 
however, that our frontiers are well protected and we are 
capable of facing all eventualities. 
  To other question, Aftab Shabaz Mirani replied that the 
prime 
minister has openly asked the opposition to end its boycott and 
return to the National Assembly. He said the government could 
still adopt many measures to end the confrontation and bring the 
opposition back to the negotiating table.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr Hamilton's Logic"] </F>
  [Text] The speech of Mr Lee Hamilton, Chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, at a meeting of the Asia Society, 
needs to be noted for the perception about Kashmir in the US 
Congress. It could, of course, be different from that of the US 
Administration, but it does reflect the views of the most 
powerful group of US legislators who are likely to fashion the 
future course of American policy in the Sub-Continent. That 
this group has for long been subjected to pressure of the Indian 
lobby in Congress is clear from two specific statements that Mr. 
Hamilton made. One, that the Kashmir plebiscite proposal had 
been overtaken by history and two, that the present Line of 
Control should be made into an international border. The first 
is obviously the repeat of the Indian line which says that since 
local elections have been held in the Valley and since Sheikh 
Abdullah, the then pro-India Kashmiri leader, authenticated the 
State's accession to India, the promise of plebiscite given to 
the people of Kashmir has been overtaken by history. The 
argument suffers from two serious flaws. First, that the 
elections were held under Indian supervision and not that of the 
UN. And second, that Sheikh Abdullah soon realised that he had 
been tricked into accepting the accession of Kashmir and wanted 
its reversal. He was jailed for 14 years. This is the history 
that is supposed to have overtaken the UN resolutions. It was 
clearly contrived with a lot of deceit and chicanery. To accept 
such a history to legitimise an immoral act and then fashion the 
future on that basis, is to repudiate the very principles the US 
stands for. When Hitler occupied Poland, why did America decide 
to stand up and fight? Why was not that piece of history 
accepted as a fait accompli? The answer lies in the fact that 
the circumstances which lead to a historical event too have to 
be judged. If the Indian occupation of Kashmir has now to be 
legitimised by the US, then the American people should ask 
whether India had promised to hold a plebiscite or not, under 
the UN supervision? Or whether the people of Kashmir ever 
surrendered that right? Or whether India ever stopped 
manipulating the local governments of the Valley? Or whether it 
dares to hold and election there? These are moral questions 
that need to be addressed before accepting the fait accompli. 
  Mr. Hamilton's second proposal that the Line of Control be 
converted into a permanent border, also echoes the Indian line. 
But in this case he began contradicting it himself when he said 
in the same speech that any negotiated settlement must take into 
account the wishes of the people of Kashmir. How does one 
ascertain those wishes? And what if the people of Kashmir do 
not want Indian rule? Hitler too could have said that he would 
address the economic grievances of the Polish people, provided 
he was allowed to rule there. The faces of land-grabbers change 
but moral principles do not.

<F P=106> [Article by Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema: "Business Before Agni for </F>
India"] 
  [Text] On 21st April, 1994 a newspaper report said that 
India has decided to cap its indigenously developed intermediate 
range missile programme, Agni, temporarily due to severe 
financial crunch. Another report published in a different 
newspaper talked about the firm resolve of the Indian PM [Prime 
Minister] Narasimha Rao not to abandon India's nuclear 
programme. Explaining in detail introduction of various types 
of missiles into the Indian defence system, Rao took pains to 
clarify that the Americans were not pressurising Indians to give 
up trials of `Agni'. While the 1960s witnessed intense 
discussion revolving about the operationalisation of 
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) with nuclear 
warheads, the 80s and 90s have seen the arrival of precision 
guided missile system capable of carrying both nuclear and 
conventional warheads. 
  India embarked upon an ambitious programme of missile 
development and their eventual deployment some 20 years back. 
In addition to many strategic considerations, slow development 
of combat aircraft for deep-strike and interdiction contributed 
enormously to the accelerated pace of missile development 
programme. The Indian programme is a fairly comprehensive one 
which includes missiles like Agni (intermediate range ballistic 
missile), Prithivi (medium range surface to surface missile), 
Nag (anti-tank missile), Akash and Trishul (surface to air 
missile). 
  Some reports suggest that both the Indian army and Indian 
airforce are going to deploy 75 and 25 Prithivi missiles by the 
middle or this year. Having successfully completed the third 
launch of Agni, indicating that India has now acquired a 
capability of delivering one toner [as published] warheads (both 
nuclear as well as conventional) to a distance over 2000 km, the 
Indians are now engaged in a fierce debate whether or not to 
deploy Agni quickly. 
  With the improvised precision guidance system of Indian 
missiles, one expects that they would soon be employed. 
Besides, many in India vociferously stress that the fruits of 
hard work in this area are beginning to pay dividends now, and 
that Agni should not be abandoned at this point. Why then the 
capping of the Agni programme? 
  Four factors need to be analysed for an answer. The official 
reason is of course the problem of finances. This is hard to 
believe. A country which has been spending over five crores a 
day to violently suppress the freedom struggle in Kashmir is 
unlikely to abandon a programme which has placed it in the 
exclusive club of those in possession of ICBMs. In any case 
India will deploy Prithivi missile which costs little over three 
crores each. Why has this plan not been postponed for the same 
reason? 
  The second factor can be technical problems. But for the 
successful third launch, one could have accepted this as, at 
that time, the problem of nose-cone and some complexities of 
precision guidance system frequently cropped up. Many 
criticised huge spending on the Agni programme at the time. But 
now that the Indians have overcome all the technical problems, 
and to quote the Indian Chief of Army Staff General Joshi, Agni 
has put India in a `totally different league', the reasoning 
sounds absurd. 
  The third reason could be that it is meant as a sop to the 
Americans. It is common knowledge that the US desperately wants 
to promote nuclear non-proliferation in the region. Both India 
and Pakistan, Pakistan much more than India, have been feeling 
the pinch of American pressure. But PM Rao has been denying 
there was any pressure on India from the US and that even if 
there was, Delhi would resist it. It is a matter of fact that 
the Americans have been dealing with Delhi with kid gloves. But 
they have their concerns. According to an American analyst 
working for Carnegie Endowment: `If India decides to make Agni 
operational, it would escalate US fears about an open ended 
nuclear missiles race in the region'. He further states that 
the success of Agni has not only rendered the MTCR [Missile 
Technology Control Regime] ineffective but seriously jeopardised 
one of the US key mechanism to control missile proliferation in 
South Asia. It seems that the government of India withstood all 
the pressures until Indian scientists had completed the 
requisite spadework and conveyed the success of Agni to the 
Indian PM. Cognizant of the American interests in the area, a 
short term delay in actual deployment can not only effectively 
ward off the pressure but may also be styled as a friendly 
gesture to the US to be encashed at a proper time. 
  The final factor is that it is a tactical withdrawal. The 
Agni missile can be operationalised within two years even if it 
is frozen at the present level of preparedness. Besides, Agni 
has already demonstrated India's technological superiority, 
putting it on hold for the time being will not be a big step 
backward. 
  Also the US and many other western nations are viewing the 
Indian economic market favourably. They want to and are 
investing heavily there. The postponement of the Agni programme 
is a symbolic gesture to these potential investors and trade 
partners that India means business.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ejaz Hussain] </F>
  [Text] The federal government created history last Monday 
[April 25] by announcing a comprehensive and far-reaching 
package of judicial and administrative reforms for Northern 
Areas. The package includes grant of adult franchise given for 
the first time to the people of the Northern Areas, party-based 
elections, and reservation of two seats for women in the elected 
council. The federal minister for information and broadcasting, 
Mr. Khalid Ahmad Kharal, said the chief executive of the 
Northern Areas will have the status of a federal minister. The 
Northern Areas will be granted fiscal autonomy. The existing 
post of judicial commissioner would also be abolished, and in 
its place the chief court would be set up which will be headed 
by a retired judge of a provincial high court. He also said the 
post of chief commissioner will be replaced by chief secretary 
assisted by four secretaries. The minister announced October as 
the month of general elections to the enlarged Northern Areas 
Council. The people of the area, including leading politicians, 
lawyers, intellectuals, and laymen, have hailed this historic 
decision of the government. The Northern Areas with an area of 
over 29,000 square miles and a population of nearly 7 lakh have 
six districts; namely, Gilgit, Skardu, Baltistan, (Jia Mer), 
(Khujar), and (Laochi). 
  The region is enormously important to Pakistan for a number 
of reasons. First of all, its picturesque beauty, snow-covered 
mountains, fabulous lakes, crystal glaciers, orchards and 
gardens, minerals and fruits fascinate tourists from all over 
the world. The government of Pakistan earns over 70 million 
rupees annually from the tourism industry of the region. 
Besides, the legendary Karakoram Highway, which is a towering 
emblem of unbreakable Sino-Pak friendship, links Pakistan with 
the Central Asian Republics, which are integral part of Economic 
Cooperation Organization. 
  The region is also significant from the strategic point of 
view, as Siachen Glacier -- the highest battlefield in the world 
-- is also situated in the Northern Areas. The people of these 
areas won their freedom through armed struggle against Dogra 
rulers soon after the creation of Pakistan. However, their 
grievances and heritage from the Dogra colonial era were not 
redressed. The late Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto started taking 
steps in the right direction. He constituted a land commission 
for them, created Ministry for Northern Areas, allocated service 
and education quota for them, started development programs, set 
up dispensaries and health units, and encouraged NGO's 
[nongovernment organizations] like Agha Khan Trust and Gilgit 
Society. He abolished the notorious Frontier Crimes Regulation. 
  The caretaker prime minister, Moin Qureshi, during his three 
months' rule, took a few vital decisions. It would not be 
inaccurate to say that Moin Qureshi's proposals for reforms in 
the Northern Areas provided impetus to the incumbent prime 
minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, who has left no stone unturned to 
offer all types of incentives to the people of the region. The 
prime minister in the fall of 1993 announced 70 development 
schemes for Northern Areas. They included housing, 
communication, transportation, education, health, employment, 
and women emancipation. She has reaffirmed that Northern Areas 
would be among the leading beneficiaries of the social action 
programs. She has also emphasized the establishment of an 
industrial zone in the Northern Areas and investors would be 
offered wide-ranging incentives. The prime minister has also 
asked the OGDC [Oil and Gas Development Corporation] experts to 
prepare feasibility report for providing fuel facilities to the 
region, specially natural gas. The prime minister is determined 
to bring the Northern Areas and other neglected parts of the 
country at par with the other areas. She is well aware of the 
fact that democracy means uniformity of privileges and that 
socioeconomic and political discrepancies damage the entire 
structure of a state. This is one of the interpretations of her 
future vision of Pakistan.

  [Text] Syria today asked Israel to stop issuing mysterious 
statements and to declare its clear readiness to effect a 
comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan in order 
to realize a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  Speaking before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
arrival in Damascus today, an official Syrian source said that 
Syria is serious about its call for realizing comprehensive 
withdrawal in exchange for comprehensive peace, but will not 
accept a peace by installments. 
  The source said that Syria wants a just and comprehensive 
peace in the region and will support all efforts in that 
direction but will not accept any partial or separate solutions 
and will reject incomplete peace, a peace which comes by 
installments. 
  The Syria official [as heard] said: Peace cannot be divided. 
Either there is a just and comprehensive peace, giving everybody 
their full rights and ending the roots of tension in the region, 
or there is not. This is because a settlement that lacks these 
elements cannot survive and the region will continue to be 
primed for an explosion at any time. 
  The Syrian official ridiculed Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's 
statements in which he described making a decision to withdraw 
from the Golan as a painful decision, saying that the Golan's 
people are the ones who are pained because Israel occupied their 
land and homes. He said that occupation is an illegal act of 
aggression and it is the people of the Golan who should be 
feeling the pain because they were expelled from their land and 
homes. By withdrawing from the Golan, Israel is not offering 
concessions because it will be withdrawing from a territory 
which it does not own, he said, adding that the Golan has always 
been and will always be a Syrian Arab territory. 
  The Syrian official urged Christopher to play the role of an 
impartial mediator and a full partner and pressure Israel in 
order to state its readiness to implement UN resolutions and 
apply the land-for-peace principle. 
  The official said: All we want is the implementation of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, which are supported by 
international norms and conventions. We want to regain our 
rights and this is legitimate. 
  The source reiterated Syria's rejection of secret talks and 
separate deals. The Syrian official asked: Why demand secret 
talks if the party calling for them is sincere in its intentions 
and desire to realize peace?

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In the article "The Entire Golan", AL-BA'TH writes: 
Since the peace process kicked off in Madrid two and one-half 
years ago, our declared position has not changed. Inspired by 
the principles on which the peace process was launched, our 
position has been absolutely clear. In contrast, Israel has 
consistently sought to throw the peace process off course. 
  The Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has put forward 
fresh proposals under the heading "Majdal Shams First" along the 
lines of the Gaza-Jericho First. Syria will have nothing to do 
with a first or second. This is because if we engage in such 
phrases, it will lead to our engagement in the labyrinth of 
separate settlements and deals, something to which we are 
totally opposed as it threatens the foundations of the peace 
initiative itself. 
  Syria advocates a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the 
occupied Arab territories as the road leading to the peace of 
the brave. All that Syria wants is full peace as envisaged by 
the peace initiative. 
  Out of a commitment to a universal solution as laid out by 
the peace initiative, Syria wants the entire Golan Heights back 
and a full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories. 
Any other options are a waste of time and an attempt to gain 
time and evade the requirements of peace. This is where the 
responsibility of the sponsors of the peace conference come in. 
It is a test of their ability to put an end to Israel's 
continuing maneuvers, AL-BA'TH concludes.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: During the talks held between President 
Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
yesterday, the president reiterated Syria's true desire to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace that guarantees the 
rights of all parties. This Syrian desire to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace was not conceived on the spur of the moment, 
but a strategy that has been adopted by Syria for many years. 
The objective of peace has been, and still is, the heart of 
Syria's policy. Syria has responded positively to every call or 
initiative to establish peace based on the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the return of Arab rights to their 
owners. 
  Since past initiatives have not achieved their objectives, 
and the last two and a half years of talks have not achieved 
peace thus far, we must lay the blame at the feet of the 
Israelis. Israel has foiled each and every call or initiative 
to achieve peace in the past, obstructed and hampered the 
current peace process, and prevented the achievement of any 
results worth mentioning. 
  Today, it seems there will be a new opportunity to push the 
peace process forward if Israel abandons its previous stands and 
deals positively with the substantive queries the U.S. secretary 
of state carried with him from Damascus. The queries deal with 
the basic issues and not with formalities and unimportant 
issues. We do not believe the bases of a just and comprehensive 
peace need further explanation or clarification, for the peace 
process is based on specific and clear principles; namely, the 
UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. When all the 
parties declare their adherence to these principles, then peace 
will be within reach. The more this or that party departs from 
these principles, the more dim become the prospects to achieve 
peace. 
  Syria has announced its stand toward peace. It is a stand 
based on the UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. 
This stand has not and will not change. By the same token, 
Syria is concerned about establishing the peace of the brave in 
the region, and is committed to the peace process until it 
achieves its goals; it adheres to its right to restore every 
inch of the Golan and the occupied territories. 
  Syria said it will not accept half solutions and partial 
withdrawals. Moreover, it did not take part in the Madrid 
conference and the Washington negotiations to bargain over its 
territory and rights, but joined the peace process out of its 
desire for a just and honorable peace and because the peace 
initiative is based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 
338, which are in harmony with Syria's peace strategy. 
  Any peace that is not established on firm bases will be 
threatened with collapse at any time. Any peace that does not 
liberate all the occupied Arab territories and restore all the 
usurped rights cannot be established. It is either 
comprehensive peace or no peace. Withdrawal must also be full, 
for it is impossible to achieve peace with the continuation of 
occupation. Syria has sought and is still seeking a just and 
comprehensive peace that can last and hold. This peace, which 
is based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, is the 
only means to end the whirlpool of wars and aggression, and 
restore rights to their owners. If the other party is ready for 
such peace, it will find reciprocation from Syria. Only then, 
can the peace process proceed toward the objective aspired by 
the region and the world. The ball is still in the Israeli 
court. Israel must answer these substantive queries. And, in 
light of their answers, we can then talk about the progress or 
retreat of the peace process. The opportunity is still 
available to achieve the aspired peace.

  [Text] Gentlemen: U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher expects his talks in Damascus to be serious and 
important. Syria firmly believes in a just and comprehensive 
peace in the Middle East based on the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, a peace that entrenches international 
law as the sole umbrella for this peace. 
  Syria is a basic party to the peace process. Without active 
Syrian participation, peace cannot prevail in the region. 
Still, Syria cannot be lured into half-way solutions or 
half-way settlements. Syria will not bargain on Arab rights and 
Arab lands. Syria sees no chance for peace unless this peace is 
just and comprehensive. 
  The U.S. secretary has much experience with Syria, where he 
has held lengthy talks several times. On more than one 
occasion, Syria has supported the U.S. Administration's efforts 
to relieve the peace process of the Israeli intransigence and 
behavior that Tel Aviv's rulers hoped would abort the entire 
process. 
  During the recent and historic Geneva meeting between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, the U.S. President announced his 
open support for President al-Asad's call for an honorable peace 
of the brave. Christopher joined President Clinton in expressing 
the conviction that Syria's role is central to the success of 
the peace process. They repeatedly hailed Syria's constructive 
efforts. 
  It is an established fact that Israel has placed every 
possible obstacle in the way of a just and comprehensive 
solution of the region's crisis. Israel has sought to replace 
the Security Council resolutions, the principles of the Madrid 
conference, and the essence of the U.S. initiative itself with 
partial and phased settlements that do not meet minimum Arab 
aspirations and rights. To the contrary, these settlements 
entrench occupation and colonialism, and exasperate tension in 
the Middle East. 
  For more than two years, the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian 
delegations to the Washington negotiations were unable to 
convince Israel to discuss the subject of withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories. Israel has openly rejected 
discussing the subject of withdrawal from the Golan and south 
Lebanon, and has proposed an endless series of conditions, 
restrictions, and advance security arrangements in return for 
promises of partial withdrawals. 
  Israel did not discuss with the Arabs in Washington the 
realization of a just, comprehensive, and equitable peace. 
Instead, it discussed the imposition of its settlements, which 
seriously undermine the principles of just and comprehensive 
peace. 
  The Israeli position can be summed up as follows: Arabs 
should prove their peaceful intentions by concluding treaties, 
normalizing relations, opening borders, and subjecting their 
occupied territories to long-term Israeli control. 
  This is not peace. It can never lead to peace. It is an 
attempt by the occupier to entrench its occupation and impose 
its will. It is natural that Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan reject 
such an alleged and deceptive peace, and adhere to the Security 
Council resolutions and the Madrid conference agreements. One 
principle of a solid peace is that this peace should be 
equitable and just, and should return rights to their owners. 
  Israel's leaders are completely aware of Syria's positions. 
They know there will be no peace without Israel's complete 
withdrawal from the Golan and all the occupied territories. 
They also know Syria will in no way involve itself in partial 
settlements and compromises. 
  So, the proposals that Israel asked the U.S. secretary to 
bring with him will not be serious if they do not meet Syria's 
demand for full withdrawal. If peace can be realized through 
deeds, not words, then Syria is waiting for deeds, not words. 
These deeds include full acceptance of the Security Council 
resolutions, not proposals that circumvent these resolutions and 
evade the principle of full and rapid withdrawal, the 
dismantling of all settlements, and the evacuation of all 
settlers. 
  Syria supports just and comprehensive peace. It will 
continue to work tirelessly for just and comprehensive peace, 
but within the framework of international legitimacy and its 
resolutions.

  [Excerpts] Under the patronage of comrade leader President 
Hafiz al-Asad, secretary general of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party, the General Federation of Trade Unions held a big speech 
rally today on the occasion of world labor day, which falls on 1 
May. The speech rally was held at Basil al-Asad Hall in 
al-Fayha' sports city in Damascus. Prime Minister Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi stood in for the president. [passage omitted] 
  At the rally, Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi delivered a 
speech on behalf of President Hafiz al-Asad in which he stressed 
that the Syrian working class is celebrating 1 May with 
confidence and optimism and with a clear and comprehensive 
vision of the future. He said: 
  [Begin al-Zu'bi recording] Brothers, it is my pleasure and 
privilege to represent President Hafiz al-Asad [applause] at 
this celebration and to convey to you the greetings of our 
leader, who devoted himself and his efforts to his people and 
his nation. He carried Syria's aspirations and the Arabs' issues 
on his strong and solid shoulders. He gave the workers and all 
the producers in this homeland most of his attention and support. 
  I also convey to you the president's congratulations on this 
great day, along with his wishes that are full of love and 
confidence, confidence that the innovative and productive human 
being will continue to be the basic pillar of any society 
aspiring for growth and development as well as confidence that 
people armed with national and pan-Arab awareness alone can see 
their way through all circumstances, events, and changes. They 
are the force that can overcome obstacles and challenge dangers. 
People who are armed with national and pan-Arab awareness can 
raise the edifice and work to increase production. They are the 
ones who make out of their self dependency and potential a 
launching pad to embody their will, strengthen their unity, 
reinforce their cause, promote their prestige, and confront 
challenges, no matter what form they take at any time. [end 
recording] 
  Al-Zu'bi spoke, in general, about the features of the stage 
the world is facing and the current status of Arab reality. He 
stressed the need to develop effective Arab solidarity and joint 
Arab action so this will be the condition for formulating a 
united pan-Arab stand, to which there is no alternative, in 
order to win the battle of peace and to achieve a just peace. 
  The prime minister then spoke about the determination of 
Syria, under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, to 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace as well as its 
determination not to relinquish any inch of its or any Arab 
territory. He said: 
  [Begin al-Zu'bi recording] The Geneva summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton [applause] showed how 
objective the Syrian stand is and how capable it is of defending 
the principles of pan-Arabism and Arab interests. The Geneva 
summit also showed how much attention the international 
community gives to Syria's role in this region. 
  Syria made the Geneva convention a forum for the national 
stand, the Arab right, pan-Arab dignity. The Geneva summit 
highlighted the continuous achievements of a big Arab leader, 
around the leadership of whom Syria's masses rally with 
strength, awareness, and persistence. The masses of the Arab 
nation surround leader al-Asad with their hopes, wishes, and 
pan-Arab feelings. Syria was and still is determined to 
continue the peace process, but with clarity, comprehensiveness 
without separate deals, and full response to the international 
community and its will and resolutions that cannot be subject to 
changes or falsification. A just and comprehensive peace that 
embodies the land for peace principle is the basis that enables 
the peace process to continue without obstacles toward its true 
objective. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi concluded his speech by 
renewing allegiance to big leader President Hafiz al-Asad. 
Al-Zu'bi expressed his sincerity toward President al-Asad's 
great policy and triumphant leadership and toward continuing the 
march of building and liberation, the objectives of which 
President al-Asad outlined with responsibility and seriousness.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Sources Tell AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Syrian-Russian Military Agreement Serves Peace"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Russian sources 
in Damascus told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the return of 
military cooperation between Syria and Russia will serve the 
issue of peace and stability in the Middle East and help to 
implement the UN and Security Council resolutions in order to 
achieve peace. 
  The Syrian and Russian sides signed a military cooperation 
agreement on the evening of the day before yesterday which 
political circles described as the first of its kind in this 
sphere since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 
establishment of the Russian Federation. [passage omitted] 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolov [name as 
transliterated] stressed the day before yesterday that, while he 
understands the Israelis' concern over selling weapons to Syria, 
he confirms that the Syrians too are concerned over the sale of 
modern Western weapons to Israel. He added that, "if arms sale 
deals are not concluded with Syria, other states are bound to 
make offers. It is out of the question that the Russians are 
going to offer anything except the sale of defensive weapons and 
spare parts for weapons sold to Syria under previous deals."

  [Text] The delegation of ambassadors of Islamic and Latin 
American countries, which concluded its four-day visit of Jammu 
and Kashmir, blamed Islamabad for aiding and abetting terrorism 
in Kashmir valley. Reports say that the ambassadors were 
convinced that Pakistan is behind terrorism in the state. The 
group has assessed that ordinary people in the state would like 
to see the end of violence and the situation brought back to 
normal. They were unhappy that the Hurriyyat Conference leaders 
changed the venue of the meeting at the last moment and that 
envoys could not meet them. However, the delegation was 
satisfied it could meet a cross section of the people. The 
delegation regretted that Amnesty International released its 
report on human rights situation in Punjab without going there, 
although it was permitted to send a team to the state.

India will support nonproliferation measures which are 
universal, comprehensive, nondiscriminatory, and verifiable. 
The minister of state for external affairs, R.L. Bhatia, 
informed the members in the lower house of parliament today that 
New Delhi has expressed deep concern to the U.S. Administration 
at the proposed transfer of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. He said 
during the visit to India, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, 
Mr. Strobe Talbott, was told that the transfer of such 
sophisticated aircraft to Pakistan will necessitate that India 
reappraise its own defense capabilities and take adequate steps 
to safeguard its security.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Evil Omen"] </F>
  [Text] The indication given by the U.S. Administration that 
it will impose the "Special 301" trade law on India is proof of 
the U.S. mentality of economic imperialism. Overlooking the 
provisions of the "GATT" world trade agreement in making such a 
decision could ultimately lead to a new Cold War -- a situation 
that could prove harmful to the United States -- because no 
country can ignore its economic interests to defend U.S. 
economic and trade interests. It is true that the United States 
is the only superpower in the world today, but it would be an 
intolerable situation if it were to act unilaterally and resort 
to bullying tactics. 
  The U.S. Administration's endeavors to maintain its own 
economic prosperity following President Clinton's assumption of 
office is totally unjustifiable. There was a time when U.S. 
presidents -- President Kennedy, for instance -- tried to rid 
the world of poverty and tried to see that poor nations 
prospered along with the United States. Today, however, the 
Clinton Administration is hell-bent on acting arbitrarily. If 
the United States continues to act this way, it will loose the 
sympathy of other countries in the world. When this happens, 
ill will may develop and it is likely that developing countries 
may start to regard the United States as a hostile country. It 
is certain that if it looses the sympathy of the developing and 
poor countries, the United States will have difficulty finding 
markets for its products. It is no secret that the United 
States is currently facing a recession, and many East Asian 
countries and Japan are not proving to be suitable markets for 
the United States. In fact, it is impossible for the United 
States to act arbitrarily simply because it is a leading country. 
  The U.S. argument regarding the application of "Special 301" 
to India is that the Indian Government has not taken effective 
steps on copyright and patent issues. This argument is not 
completely correct. The truth is that the Indian Government has 
taken considerable and effective steps regarding copyright and 
patent issues. Because of these steps, there is no logic in 
imposing the "Special 301" law on the pretext of "inaction" on 
the issue. Of course, it is only right that those who want to 
get rich by copying U.S. products should be restrained; no 
encouragement should be given to theft and copying. When it is 
amply clear that the Indian Government is taking every step to 
curtail this, however, the United States should refrain from 
adopting aggressive postures. 
  The U.S. Administration's decision to brand China as the 
biggest thief of U.S. products reflects the imperialistic 
mentality of the United States. Undoubtedly, the theft and 
copying of products by some people does not warrant declaring 
the entire country a thief, and punishing or imposing sanctions 
against it is not natural justice. If the United States tries 
to defend its economic and trade interests by wielding a "big 
stick," such action could not be called appropriate. 
  As far as patent rights are concerned, the United States has 
enforced a "product patent" policy under which any scientist or 
entrepreneur has the right to produce and sell special products. 
Without permission, nobody can produce or manufacture that 
product. India has a "production system" patent policy. Under 
the Indian policy, no other person can adopt a patented 
production system, but the same products can be manufactured by 
a different production system. The United States wants India to 
enforce the same "product patent" policy that is prevalent in 
the United States. It is clear that the Americans want to 
become the owners of products developed from hidden natural 
wealth or by scientific techniques. Accordingly, the United 
States has enforced a "product patent" policy. If the United 
States does not want to share its intellectual, scientific, and 
technical knowledge with all of humanity, it could only be 
described as anti-humanist. 
  It would be better if the United States reconsidered its 
patent policy. If the United States wants to remain the leading 
nation in the world, it will have to share its intellect and 
skill with the entire world and all of humanity. Neither the 
United States nor any country can claim to be a superpower if it 
does not show magnanimity. If the United States tries to remain 
a superpower by adopting bullying tactics or starting an arms 
race, it will earn only ill will -- not sympathy -- which will 
create economic as well as political problems for itself. The 
indications that the United States will bring India under 
"Special 301" are not only a bad omen, they strengthen 
apprehensions regarding its intentions at a time when the prime 
minister's U.S. visit is only a few days away. Maybe the 
"Special 301" question has been raised in an attempt to pressure 
India regarding the signing of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
Raising this issue on the eve of the prime minister's U.S. 
visit, though, cannot be taken as a positive gesture. It would 
be better if the United States came to understood fully that 
India will never yield to such pressure tactics.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 20 (HTC) -- In a cautiously worded, 
handwritten note, an official spokesperson of the Government of 
India today sought to clarify the report on the Agni missile 
plan being temporarily capped, which appeared in this newspaper 
today. 
  While describing the report as "unfounded and baseless", the 
note asserted that "after the recent successful flight of Agni, 
all the objectives set for this mission have been achieved". 
This, in fact, suggests that the project is being abandoned 
altogether, whereas the HT report had only said it was being put 
on hold for the present. 
  While not contradicting that the DRDO [Defense Research and 
Development Organization] had been denied the [Indian Rupees] Rs 
5 crore it had sought for conducting three more Agni test 
flights, the official note says that fund requirements of 
different departments are decided "in relation to progress of 
various projects. Individual scheme-wise allocation is not 
undertaken at the Government level".

  [Text] The prime minister has asserted that there will not 
be any capping of Agni nor India would accept a regional 
nonproliferation treaty. Replying to the debate on the working 
of the Defense Ministry in the Rajya Sabha today, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao said that New Delhi will not budge even an inch on India's 
policy that the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] should be 
universal and nondiscriminatory. The prime minister asserted 
that the country will continue to have optimum defense 
preparedness and no one should tell us what our defense 
requirement should be. 
  Referring to the controversy over the recently-held London 
talks, he said we should not refuse talks, as it is important to 
apprise the other party of our view on this issue. He 
categorically reiterated that there is no pressure from the 
United States for capping our missile programs. On the visit of 
the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr. Talbott, to New Delhi, 
he said the NPT was not discussed. Mr. Rao said that the NPT 
itself is under review and India has demanded that it should be 
radically changed in its spirit to make it more acceptable to 
Third World countries. 
  On Agni, he said it is an experiment and not a missile 
program. He asserted that it will not be stopped under any 
conditions. He said it is absurd to say such a program of 
national importance will be stopped for want of 50 crore rupees. 
He said that the data from recent experiment of recent 
technology is being analyzed and it will be about a year to 
complete the study. The prime minister announced that the 
government's decision to set up a National Security Council, 
which will examine the total security need of the country. 
[sentence as heard] 
  Assessing the present world security scenario, Mr. Rao said 
in the post-Cold War era developing nations have to be more 
vigilant. He hailed the international treaty banning the 
chemical weapons as a major step toward disarmament, which is 
universal and nondiscriminatory. He said the Nonaligned 
Movement has greater relevance today for putting forward the 
developing countries' views. 
  Expressing dissatisfaction over the prime minister's 
clarification over the Agni program, most opposition members 
staged a walkout from the house.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The False Propaganda of the Opposition Parties] </F>
  [Text] The opposition political parties believe they have 
been able to intensify the movement against India's signing of 
the GATT agreement. This impression is correct, as their 
movement is gradually gaining strength. This strength is not 
based on logic, however; it is based on the power of the throat. 
It is with the force of their voice that the opposition parties 
have severely shaken all parts of India from Kashmir down to 
Kanniyakumari [Tamil Nadu]. Their thundering sound was heard 
mainly in West Bengal. Like the clouds that precede a rainstorm 
if they encounter a depression, the thunder clouds of their 
anti-Dunkel movement weakened once they crossed the coasts of 
West Bengal and entered other parts of the country. Thus the 
tiger was converted into a mouse. 
  There is nothing to be surprised about. Though the 
opposition claims they have the people's support, they know very 
well that public opinion is not in their favor. Neither the 
number of people attending their rallies at the Calcutta Brigade 
Ground nor the extent of the anarchy let loose by the people in 
the streets of West Bengal proves this party has public support. 
It only speaks to the organizational strength of the party; 
that is, its capacity to gather people. It is not a great feat 
for Jyoti Basu [West Bengal chief minister] or Subhas 
Chakrabarty [West Bengal minister of sports and youth services], 
who are in power in West Bengal, to display this strength. 
These anti-GATT rallies in the state, under the patronage of 
the state government, are just meetings intended to make noise, 
similar to those held on other occasions. It is not a major 
achievement to gather people for such meetings in a densely 
populated country like ours, particularly when holidays are 
declared in courts and offices and the required number of buses 
and trucks are provided for participants. This advantage 
available in West Bengal is not found in other parts of the 
country. This hue and cry is being raised in the name of the 
general masses, but they do follow the leftist line at all. 
  Why should they think so? The opposition parties have been 
launching propaganda against the Dunkel proposals for a long 
time. Despite this, the general public does not give any heed to 
their propaganda. Why should they? The people have come to 
realize that slogans are the only driving force behind this hue 
and cry. Besides, they have come to learn that this is false 
propaganda and that false statements are being presented to the 
people in fancy language. What is happening in the fields and 
in the parliament is not publicity; it is false propaganda. 
These political parties claimed that if India signed the 
Marrakech agreement, in a few moments the price of medicine 
would increase several fold and people in the villages would not 
be able to pluck the leaves of their neem trees, adding that 
U.S. permission would be required to pluck these leaves. These 
parties further claimed that representatives of international 
agencies would grab paddy seedlings from the farmers as they 
went to plant them. They issued many similar warnings. If we 
listen to all this, it looks as if a grandmother is trying to 
frighten a child by telling him about witches. The false 
stories about witches are similar to those of the opposition 
parties in their propaganda against the Dunkel proposals and the 
Marrakech agreement. 
  The truth is that a total of 105 countries met and finalized 
this agreement. In doing so, every country had to give up some 
of the demands they had submitted. None of the states were able 
to achieve everything they wanted from this agreement. If a 
comparative study is made of the profits and losses, it will be 
seen that India will not lose but will gain from this accord. 
The valuable information provided by the commerce minister in 
this regard is a clear yardstick for the gains India will 
achieve from this accord. Those whose only intention is play 
politics will not heed these valuable words. Since the Rajya 
Sabha went into session, these political parties have started 
jumping up and down in the house. They are raising a hue and 
cry alleging that the country's independence is being sold out. 
They are disrupting the proceedings of the assembly. This 
clearly shows that their condemnation or criticism does not have 
any healthy objective. It aims only to fulfill cheap political 
goals. 
  The leftist political parties in the country and like-minded 
intellectuals are solely responsible for this narrow-minded, 
illogical, and damaging propaganda. These leftist political 
parties have committed several mistakes in the past. During 
World War II, they distanced themselves from the independence 
struggle and directly obstructed this movement. They did not 
accept Subash Chandra [independence leader also known as Netaji 
Basu] as a patriot; they branded him a traitor. They have long 
been bitter critics of private capital and foreign industrial 
organizations. They have been forced to admit all of their 
mistakes one by one. Now their spokesman is paying tribute to 
Gandhi and Nehru, and they have become followers of Netaji Basu. 
In recent speeches their leaders have appeared eager for 
foreign technology and capital. The day will come when they will 
also admit their mistakes regarding the Dunkel proposals and 
GATT, but history will not pardon these sinners. 
  In the meantime, the Bharatiya Janata Party's [BJP] 
condition 
has become critical because of its involvement in this false 
propaganda. On the issue of whether to support or oppose the 
Dunkel proposals, the BJP has decided to oppose them. There is 
nothing to be surprised about. Behind its cloak of championing 
the cause of Hinduism, this party is also a leftist party. 
Vishwanath Pratap Singh's [Janata Dal leader] stand on this 
issue is different. He has stated that there is no alternative 
to signing the GATT treaty. Will Jyoti Basu listen to his 
"friend" today?

  [Text] The two-year sanctions imposed by the US in May, 
1992, on the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) created 
only minor inconvenience and that none of the country's space 
programme schedules were affected, Mr R Kasturirangan, new 
chairman of ISRO said here on Friday. 
  "The sanctions will be automatically revoked and that we 
have 
no information on the thinking of the United States government," 
ISRO chief added. The sanctions will be expiring next month. 
  Even after the US clamped sanctions on ISRO and Glavkosmos, 
the Russian rocket manufacturing company for signing the 
cryogenic engine deal, India was able to launch two satellites 
-- Insat-2A and Insat-2B and two more in the same series -- 
Insat-2C and 2D are on schedule. "We were able to procure 
components from other sources," Mr Kasturirangan said. 
  Though the sanctions are still in force, ISRO and Glavkosmos 
renegotiated the cryogenic engine deal last month, whereby the 
Russian company would be shipping seven engines at no fresh cost 
to ISRO. Apparently, the Russian government got the deal cleared 
by the US State Department. 
  The countdown for the fourth development test flight of 
Augmented satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV-D4) has begun and is 
expected to tae off during the early hours on May 4,1994.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA)--Justin Mugenzi, Rwanda's 
minister of trade and industry and president of the Liberal 
Party, has said that his visit to Egypt is part of the 
consultations held by the government of Rwanda to stop the 
current massacres in the country. 
  At a news conference in Cairo today, he said he discussed 
the 
situation in Rwanda with President Husni Mubarak during their 
meeting today. He said he appealed to the president to use his 
influence and relations to end the war. 
  He also urged the international community to intervene to 
stop the fighting and persuade all sides to abandon arms so that 
the people of Rwanda can be convinced to halt the war. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mugenzi said his country has been in a state of war for four 
years, during which the number of refugees and displaced inside 
the country rose from 400,000 people to 1 million. With a 
population of 7 million people, there is one refugee for every 
seven people in Rwanda, he said. [passage omitted] 
  On the security situation in Rwanda, Mugenzi explained that 
the government is doing all it can to restore stability and calm 
to a country where people are dominated by a spirit of revenge. 
The government expresses regret for the victims of violence and 
is doing everything in its power to stop this bloody human 
tragedy, he said. 
  He said the conflict has gone beyond all rational 
boundaries, 
and the war has turned into a tribal and ethnic one. It is 
difficult to control a people willing to apply their own law of 
revenge and ones who are confident that their primary enemy is 
the Patriotic Front and its Tutsi tribes, he said. This is the 
reason for the violence in the country, he added. 
  He regretted and condemned the killings in his country and 
called on the people to demonstrate patience and leave the 
government to do its job. 
  On reports that the Belgian forces operating within the UN 
peace- keeping force are involved in Rwanda's incidents, 
Minister Mugenzi expressed his country's "anxiety" [ta'azzum] 
over the conduct of the Belgian forces. He said: Our relations 
with Belgium have until recently been extremely good. We do not 
blame the Belgian Government for the acts of some personnel, and 
we believe those are individual acts. 
  He said Rwanda is concerned about the conduct of the Belgian 
forces. Since they set foot in the capital Kigali, he said, 
they have been engaged in suspect acts with support from the 
Patriotic Front. We warned those forces against this conduct, 
and officials apologized for some incidents, he said. 
  He added: We clearly say that many members of these Belgian 
forces cooperate with the Patriotic Front. They were placed in 
strategic positions and several armed battles have taken place 
between them and the government forces in Rwanda, resulting in 
many victims. 
  He said his country demanded withdrawal of those forces, and 
the necessary measures for this withdrawal have already been 
taken. The forces reached the border and this is satisfactory, 
he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA)--His Eminence al-Azhar Grand 
Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq has appealed to the United 
Nations to adopt the necessary resolutions to stop the massacres 
Serbians are committing against the Muslim citizens of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and refrain from rewarding the aggressor on 
his actions. 
  In a statement he issued today, the al-Azhar shaykh called 
on 
Islamic governments and peoples to unite and back the efforts 
Egypt and some Islamic states are making at the United Nations 
to deter the treacherous aggression, return the lands the Serbs 
usurped to their Muslim owners, and lift the arms embargo so 
that the Bosnian people can defend themselves against an enemy 
equipped with the most modern mass destruction weapons taken 
from the former Yugoslavia and some other governments. 
  The al-Azhar grand shaykh expressed his pain and deep 
concern 
at the crimes being committed against Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; the desecration of sanctities; and the 
killing of old men, women and children. These crimes conflict 
with the UN charter, the Declaration of Human Rights, basic 
ethical values, and the human bonds that link the people of the 
earth together, the statement said. 
  Jad-al-Haqq remarked that it is regrettable that this 
unjustified aggression should involve Muslims, although they are 
entitled to live according to their creeds and canons that 
recognize others' right to live according to their own creed. 
Islam reiterates that "there will be no coercion in religion," 
[Koranic verse] he said. 
  Concluding his statement, Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq prayed to Allah 
to guide mankind to the right course and preserve Muslim blood, 
land, and lives in Bosnia-Herzegovina and everywhere in the 
world.

  [Text] Cairo, 29 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper says the 
purpose of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the 
Russian capital Moscow this week was to express Israel's wish to 
end practically a long-running estrangement with Russia, 
inheritor of the former Soviet Union. It adds that the visit 
also carries an implicit message, addressed to the Syrians and 
Palestinians in particular, that Israel can compete for their 
strategic ally if it wishes. 
  In Saturday's editorial, AL-AHRAM says during his visit 
Rabin 
convinced the Russians to agree to mediate with Syria on 
searching for missing Israelis from previous wars. In addition 
there are reports that Russian officials have promised Rabin 
that, for the time being, they will refrain from selling any 
advanced aircraft to Syria. The editorial, however, doubts that 
Russia will honor its promise because of its economic situation, 
which makes it willing to sell weapons to any buyer. 
  The paper expresses its belief that, despite several 
technical agreements signed between the two countries, there are 
factors that will limit the advancement of Russian-Israeli 
relations and their talks on cooperation in the armament sector. 
  AL-AHRAM notes that current Russian policy has revised its 
retreat from and strong stands against Arab causes that were 
adopted at the end of Gorbachev's term and right after the 
Soviet Union's collapse. Furthermore, the paper says, Israel 
has no major interest in having Russia participate forcefully in 
the region's peace process.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 May (MENA)-- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that resolving Yemen's problem depends on the two parties 
to the dispute and that Egypt is following the developments and 
doing what it can. Musa said: We hope the clashes will stop, as 
President Mubarak said. He called for putting an end to armed 
clashes in order to protect Yemeni unity from disintegration. 
  Commenting on the results of the elections in South Africa, 
Musa said the African National Congress had been favored and 
expected to win the majority of votes. He remarked that this is 
a giant step in South African history because, once the 
elections are over, the road will be open to putting an end once 
and for all to racial discrimination and apartheid, so they can 
embark on a new era of democracy and majority rule. Egypt is 
looking forward to the final results and the proclamation of the 
new system in South Africa, he said. 
  Touching on the situation in Rwanda, the foreign minister 
said the situation in Rwanda is very serious and requires 
collective African action. This is what President Mubarak 
emphasized in his messages and in his contacts with the United 
Nations and the OAU, because it is primarily an African 
responsibility. But it is also an international responsibility, 
Musa said.

this evening with leader of the North Somalia National Movement 
'Abd-al- Rahman Nur and the delegation accompanying him 
currently visiting Cairo. Nur said that they discussed the 
situation, particularly in northern Somalia. 
  He said that the delegation is working for rapprochement 
between the north and south, despite the fact that there are 
elements that are calling for division. He noted that the 
delegation asked for the postponement of the reconciliation 
conference, which was scheduled to be held in Nairobi at the end 
of this month, to have sufficient time to explain the current 
situation in northern Somalia. He explained that all the 
factions that have been contacted have approved the postponement. 
  He affirmed that Egypt is playing an important role to 
achieve national reconciliation in view of its good relations 
with Somalia. Most factions have total confidence in the 
Egyptian role and hope that the Egyptian efforts to achieve 
national reconciliation in Somalia will succeed. 
  Foreign Minister Musa reaffirmed Egypt's position on Somalia 
and emphasized the importance of achieving national 
reconciliation and a solution based on the Addis Ababa 
resolutions that will protect the interests of all parties.

    [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 25 
April publishes on pages 14 and 15 a 2,200-word investigative 
report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi under the headline: "Top Secret and 
Published for the First Time." "Arrest of a Kuwaiti in Cairo on 
Charges of Financing Terrorism, and Search for Saudi Arms 
Dealer." Under this banner headline, the writer says that on 1 
April the State Security Investigations Department arrested a 
Kuwaiti called 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mujaybil in a furnished 
apartment and took him for questioning on charges of "financing 
terrorism and supporting the extremists." During his 
interrogation, al-Mujaybil said that he is a member of an 
officially registered Kuwaiti society called "the Society for 
the Revival of Islamic Heritage." This society is headed by 
Shaykh Khalid Sultan Bin-'Isa and is managed by Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-'Atiqi. He said he came to Egypt a few days ago to extend 
some aid to a number of benevolent enterprises in Egypt. 
  Egyptian security sources, according to the writer, have 
denied the story that al-Mujaybil came to extend aid to 
benevolent enterprises, saying that he was arrested red-handed. 
He was arrested in Cairo after several days and not when he 
arrived. The investigation sources revealed that a member of an 
extremist group who was under surveillance and owns a printing 
press for printing and publishing religious books and leaflets 
was seen more than once meeting with the Kuwaiti 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Mujaybil immediately after the latter's arrival in Cairo. 
When the security forces stormed the house of the printing 
press owner, they discovered a check for a large sum of money 
paid to him by 'Abd-al-Rahman al- Mujaybil, as well as large 
sums of foreign currency. Al-Mujaybil claimed under 
interrogation that he gave the check to the printing press owner 
to pay for printing a book because the cost in Egypt is less 
than any other place, and that his relationship to the man is 
purely professional. However, the security authorities were not 
convinced and the investigation is continuing. 
  Meanwhile, the writer continues, the security authorities in 
Egypt and in more than one Arab country--such as Algeria, Yemen, 
and Jordan--are looking for a Saudi arms dealer called Nasir 
Mashhur al- Ruwayli, classified as the "most dangerous arms and 
drug smuggler across Arab borders." He uses drug smuggling to 
conclude arms deals. He smuggles these arms to Arab countries 
where there is intensive extremist activity, particularly Egypt, 
Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan. The writer says that al-Ruwayli is 
wanted in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Adil Hammudah: "The Government's Absence"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Terrorism, which disfigures 
Egypt's image, did not only expose the harshness and crudeness 
of the enemies of the country at home and abroad it also exposed 
the government's impotence, absence, and inability. 
  Terrorism has exposed the erosion of government bureaucracy, 
the accumulation of its mistakes, the conflicts of its members, 
and its failure to control its parties. Every official does 
what he likes. He is only concerned about himself and his 
position. As long as the danger is far away from him, others 
can go to hell. As long as he thinks that he will escape with 
his own skin, he does not mind if the flood engulfs everyone 
else. 
  The recently uncovered case proves that terrorists are 
acting 
freely, taking advantage of the government's absence. Arms and 
explosives depots surround the capital and the government is 
unaware. Underground prisons are built by the extremists in 
preparation for the kidnapping and imprisonment of hostages to 
be traded for their leaders in prison, and the government is 
unaware. Terrorists disguised as municipal workers dig 12 meters 
under Salah Salim Street in a sensitive area in preparation for 
filling a tunnel with explosives, and the government is unaware. 
Neither the Cairo governor nor the neighborhood leaders, the 
pertinent ministers, or the prime minister had any knowledge. 
Where were all these officials? Why haven't we brought them to 
account? Why hasn't any one of them submitted his resignation? 
What is the crime for which they should be brought to account 
if not this one--the crime of neglecting the security and safety 
of society. I think that this crime is equal to high treason. 
I am not exaggerating. 
  The government is busy levying money and inventing methods 
to 
collect fees and taxes. It is not concerned that the poor are 
becoming poorer, the wretched are becoming more wretched and 
miserable, and investment and commercial activity will come to a 
standstill. Increasing the fees and taxes beyond a certain 
point will lead to tax evasion, and eventually the revenue will 
decrease. Is making the people suffer one of the ministers' 
hobbies, even if the government loses some of the revenue it 
used to collect? 
  If poverty, unemployment, stagnation, and corruption are 
some 
of the factors that promote extremism, aren't we entitled to 
call on the attorney general to apply the terrorism law against 
the government and turn the Prosecution Office into a supreme 
military court? 
  If terrorism is the result of deviating religious 
thinking--as repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi said in his 
stunning television confessions--what has the government done to 
correct this deviation? Has it persuaded the al-Azhar scholars 
to stand with it? Has it discussed with them their hardline 
positions--not against terrorism, but against those who are 
confronting terrorism? Has the government been angered by the 
recent statement of the Islamic Research Institute, which 
accused the opponents of terrorism of being extremists and 
called on them to leave the arena to them, to the al-Azhar 
scholars? [passage omitted] 
  The enemies of terrorism are threatened by the bullets of 
extremism and the al-Azhar statements, and the government is 
doing nothing about it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Baghdad's Recent Decision"] </F>
  [Text] If the intentions are sincere, and we hope that they 
are this time; if the pan-Arab interest is put above personal 
whims, ambitions, and interests; and if there is a real will to 
return to Arab legitimacy -- and we are not saying international 
legitimacy -- then Baghdad's recent decisions mean that 
fundamental changes have taken place and that the winds of 
reexamination have started. Arab responsibility makes it 
incumbent on all the parties to help close this painful chapter 
in Arab history. 
  Iraq has rescinded the decision making Kuwait its 19th 
governorate. Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi 
said in a news conference that Iraq has decided to drop the 
decision it announced following his country's invasion of the 
State of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. He said that Iraq has 
officially informed the United Nations of this decision, adding 
that it was the Iraqi parliament that rescinded the decision and 
the Revolution Command Council that ratified it. At the same 
time, Iraq's parliament speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih stated that 
his country is prepared to discuss all pending issues with 
Kuwait in order to achieve stability between the two countries. 
He said that these issues could be discussed with a Kuwaiti 
parliamentary delegation when it visits Baghdad to check the 
facts and information on the issue of Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq. 
  In the first comment on the decision, the Kuwaiti ambassador 
in Cairo said that such Iraqi statements do not add anything 
new. He added that Iraq had already rescinded the annexation 
decision so as to conclude the cease fire and then presented to 
the Security Council a memorandum saying that the cancellation 
was made under "the pressure of circumstances" of the time. But 
Iraq's media and political articles later once again began to 
reiterate the story of the 19th governorate. 
  The ambassador explained that the way to solve this problem 
is for "Baghdad to recognize the Security Council and UN 
resolutions and the decisions of the borders demarcation 
committee whose establishment was approved by Iraq. These 
resolutions concern the borders, the prisoners, and 
compensations." The Kuwaiti ambassador called on the Iraqi side 
to deal with the prisoner issue through the International 
Committee of the Red Cross team that will be allowed to visit 
the prisons and detention camps. 
  In his comment on the proposal to send a Kuwaiti 
parliamentary delegation or letting some parties undertake 
shuttle trips between Baghdad and Kuwait, he said that the Arab 
League secretary general has exerted great efforts in this 
regard and these trips will be futile without recognition of the 
international resolutions. 
  Many circles believe that the recent Iraqi moves fall within 
the context of Iraq's desire to end the international sanctions 
imposed on it. Major countries such as France, Russia, and 
China support such a move and Turkey is insisting on it by 
raising the issue of the losses resulting from stopping the flow 
of Iraqi oil through its territories. 
  These moves come against acts of blackmail and schemes led 
by 
the United States in the name of the United Nations. The 
monitoring of the situation in Iraq is used as an excuse for 
these acts. The United States has imposed a no-fly zone on 
northern Iraq on the pretext of protecting the Kurds in the 
north from the Iraqi regime's repression. This was done in 
accordance with a Western agreement concluded by the United 
States, Britain, and France outside the framework of the United 
Nations and the Security Council. In the meantime, we see that 
the Shiites in southern Iraq are subjected to the same 
sufferings but the United States has not provided them with the 
same measure of protection. 
  Is it not astonishing to see the United States volunteering, 
by exploiting the United Nations name, to protect Iraq's Kurds 
but ignoring the fierce battles and massacres being perpetrated 
by Turkey's armed forces against the Kurds on the Turkish-Iraqi 
border areas? 
  Is it not astonishing to see the U.S. President persisting 
in 
playing the role of the region's cop and ordering that air 
sorties continue on the pretext of protecting the Kurds even 
after the scandal of the downing of two UN planes over the 
no-fly zone in northern Iraq? One wonders about the true U.S. 
objectives toward Iraq. Are they really the implementation of 
the UN resolutions? Or are they the dismemberment of Iraq and 
the secession of the north from the south? Does the United 
States want to implement international legitimacy or to carve up 
Iraq and paralyze its economic, military, and human resources 
and capabilities? 
  Is the complete erasure of Iraq as a state a supreme Arab 
interest? In whose interest is this being done at a time when 
the United States is making the deal of the century with Israel 
involving the "F-15A1" aircraft which the U.S. military arsenal 
has never sold to any country in the world and whose use has 
been limited to the U.S. Army alone? 
  Does the Middle East peace from the U.S. point of view mean 
subjugating, starving, and humiliating the Iraqi people and 
exhausting their resources and at the same time arming Israel 
and enabling it to achieve complete economic hegemony over the 
Arab region in light of an overwhelming military domination? 
  The State of Kuwait--government, parliament, and people--has 
the right to doubt the credibility of the latest Iraqi decision 
and no one disputes this fact because they are still living the 
bitter and painful experience ever since the invasion day. Any 
ordinary Kuwaiti citizen has the right to wonder about the 
seriousness of the Iraqi offer, ask what the guarantees are, and 
even stress the demand for such guarantees. We will have 
ignored the feelings of an entire nation if we do not achieve 
for Kuwait all the guarantees it demands. 
  The whole Arab nation has the right to ask how long the 
imposition of the blockade on Iraq and the starvation and 
humiliation of the Iraqi people will continue. The Iraqi armed 
forces have withdrawn beyond the borders and the Security 
Council resolutions have been implemented to the full. Then how 
long will the United States continue to use the international 
organization as a tool to destroy the Iraqi people and land on 
the pretext of implementing international legitimacy 
resolutions? These same international legitimacy resolutions 
are being trampled in the Israeli-occupied territories and in 
Bosnia by the Serbs while the United States does not lift a 
finger. 
  The Arab League is now required to benefit from the 
opportunity provided by the recent Iraqi decision and all 
nationalist forces are required in these circumstances to move 
urgently toward Baghdad and Kuwait to transform the Iraqi 
decision into reality. 
  The Egyptian Solidarity Committee which groups all 
nationalist forces and personalities of all affiliations in 
Egypt has made a move and issued a comprehensive political 
statement emphasizing that Iraq's recent decision turns over a 
new page to regain Arab solidarity and assert Arab 
reconciliation that has become a pressing pan-Arab demand. The 
Iraqi decision removes an obstacle that had blocked Arab 
reconciliation based on respect for international legitimacy and 
national independence of all Arab countries. The decision is 
also an incentive for all nationalist forces, parties, and 
organizations to work to enhance Arab solidarity to liberate the 
occupied Arab territories. 
  The Arab nation is now facing a difficult test; to be or not 
to be, submit and kneel to the new theorists who adopt the false 
slogans of Rabin and Peres about the promised peace, or remain 
steadfast, achieve Arab solidarity, fight for unity, and prove 
that pan-Arab security is not a lie but rather an established 
fact and that it will continue to exist today, tomorrow, and 
forever. 
  Iraq's recent decision opens the doors for us to realize the 
dream of Arab solidarity and by a joint Arab solidarity we will 
achieve our desired Arab peace, a peace based on justice, 
liberation of all the land, and recovery of Jerusalem, not the 
peace of Rabin and his new incense carriers of some of the 
former left-wing figures who have gone astray.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA)--The Arab Industrialization 
Authority [AIA] factories have modified the Egyptian al-Hadaf 
[Arabic for "target"] aircraft used for training air defense 
units in shooting. The modification involves increasing their 
fuselage area and fitting them with lights [masha'il] so that 
they can be engaged by heat-sensitive rockets in addition to 
ground artillery. 
  Engineer 'Abd-al-Hamid Wasfi, chairman of the AIA Qadir 
Factory, which manufactures this aircraft, said the modification 
also involved increasing its load capacity and range for use in 
aerial photography. 
  In a statement to AL-AKHBAR today, he added that the name 
Qadir has been given to this new type of airplane, which flies 
at 180 km/hour, is equipped with a piston engine and remote 
control, and can be made airborne without a launching pad. 
  Engineer Wasfi said production of the light armored car 
Qadir 
will begin in July after the successful production of the first 
example of the vehicle. He noted that the car is fitted with 
armored steel and glass and can be equipped with a half-inch 
turret against personnel and concentrations [not further 
specified]. 
  He said over 60 percent of the car is manufactured at the 
factory, that it is equipped with a 214-horsepower engine, and 
its maximum speed on a flat surface is 220 km/hour and 100 km on 
rough terrain. He added that Qadir car is designed for border 
guard duties, internal reconnaissance and security, and 
protection of VIP's, and that it can be used as a command room 
for radio communication units. He said the factory is capable 
of modifying normal passenger cars to bullet-proof vehicles for 
protection against weapons of up to 7.62 calibers [as received].

  [Excerpt] In a special message addressed through 
AL-'ARABI, His Holiness Pope Shanudah has declared that he 
categorically rejects the use of the Egyptian Copts' name at a 
conference on minority rights. He said: We are Egyptians and 
part of the Egyptian people. We are not a minority, do not 
consider ourselves a minority, and do not like others to call us 
a minority. The terms majority and minority indicate 
discrimination and segregation. This does not befit the sons of 
a single homeland, especially in beloved Egypt. The pope was 
commenting on a conference of Egyptians and foreigners which is 
being sponsored by a publication house. 
  Meanwhile, [Egyptian writer] Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal has 
refused to attend the conference. He published an article 
explaining the reasons for not attending, saying that the 
Egyptian Copts are not a minority and it is wrong to view them 
from this standpoint. [passage omitted]

production quota, amounting to 870,000 barrels per day, in spite 
of the increase of Egyptian oil reserves, Oil Minister Dr. Hamdi 
al-Banbi said today. 
  In statements made today, he said that this Egyptian policy 
stems from its keenness on maintaining stability of world oil 
market. 
  Dr. al-Banbi predicted that crude oil prices would be 
markedly increased due to the increase of world consumption of 
oil during the previous months.

  [Text] [Ayalon] On the margins of his Syrian-Israeli 
talks, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher spent some 90 
minutes with Palestinian dignitaries this afternoon. The 
meeting was attended by nine notables, including Faysal 
al-Husayni, Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, and Hanan 'Ashrawi. 
It should be noted that the meeting at the U.S. Consulate in 
Jerusalem was held at the request of the Palestinians. At the 
end of the meeting, Faysal al-Husayni said that in it the 
Palestinians raised their reservations with the Gaza and Jericho 
agreement, two days before it is to be signed in Cairo. 
  [Al-Husayni, in English] We have two problems: One problem 
concerning the implementation and the attitude of the Israeli 
side on the ground, especially on the isolation of Jerusalem; 
and we make it clear that if such a policy will going on, and if 
it will not be stopped, it can be the element which can kill 
such opportunity to sign for such opportunity to implementation 
of any kind of agreements. 
  [Ayalon translates and continues] The Palestinians also fear 
the practical implementation of the agreement by Israel on the 
ground. It is impossible, al-Husayni argues, that Rabin and 
'Arafat agree to decide on the size of the Jericho area, while 
in practice, Israel has already started erecting a fence around 
it. 
  [Al-Husayni, in English] We do not like the idea that they 
are saying that the size of Jericho will be decided between 
Rabin and 'Arafat, and then we are watching now that the 
Israelis are already building and putting this borders. We do 
not like it. 
  [Ayalon] The secretary listened to the reservations, but did 
not comment. Earlier, Christopher met President 'Ezer Weizman, 
but the two decided not to disclose the content of the meeting.

  [Text] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi gave a long interview to 
APS and AL-SHA'B newspaper in which he talked about the main 
facing his government. Here now are the main points of this 
interview, read by our colleague Ahmed Souq: 
  Regarding the main tasks as announced by the prime minister 
during his first statement in the post, that is, mainly, 
consolidation of the state's institutions, revival of the 
national economy, and the enhancement of national solidarity, 
Mr. Mokdad Sifi said in response to a question on the methods 
which he sees as necessary to achieve these goals: To boost the 
state's intitutions is to enable the personnel to shoulder their 
responsibilities; to take measures to free them from bureaucracy 
and the shackles and pressures of past tutelage; and to open the 
door for free expansion of initiatives in the field. 
  Work should be carried out to encourage and protect 
personnel, especially at the local level, either with regard to 
special laws or the financial aspect. To this end, the prime 
minister, added we have created of the post of a minister 
delegate in charge of local communities and administrative 
reforms. The municipalities are also a fundamental 
preoccupation of the government. 
  As for the revival of the national economy, the prime 
minister said that it is a paramount priority, and that we have 
the will and the necessary means to achieve this revival. What 
is important is that our workers, entrepreneurs, traders, and 
industrialists are able to achieve the required production 
level. We will work to gradually eliminate all the obstacles 
that are hampering productive economic activities, and we will 
encourage all initiatives. He added that there will be no room 
for speculation or the black market which has greatly harmed the 
country and its citizens. We will also considerably reduce the 
rate of unemployment. 
  Regarding national solidarity, and in addition to the 
economic measures that the government will take in favor of the 
socially deprived classes, the prime minister said that boosting 
this solidarity should take place not only through collective 
action but also within the family and inside the school. 
National action should become a part of civic action. He added 
that the State Secretariat for National Solidarity and the 
Family will coordinate with all appropriate circles to include 
the notion of national solidarity in the government's agenda. 
  During the interview with APS and AL-SHA'B, Prime Minister 
Mokdad Sifi talked about several national issues. With regard 
to implementation of the agreement with the IMF and its impact 
on the national economy, the prime minister said that the 
program of stability that we have adopted will radically change 
the conditions of management of the economy. It goes without 
saying, as he put it, that there is a need for restructuring of 
the state's role within the overall framework of national 
economy. The private sector should be allocated an important 
position on condition that all economic operators, irrespective 
of their legal position, should adhere to the same market rules.

  [Text] Khartoum, 30 April (SUNA) -- The president of the 
Republic of Sudan, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, has 
called on the inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains, who fled and 
sought refuge in Khartoum and other parts of Sudan, to return to 
their villages and areas in south Kordofan, since the government 
has expelled the rebels and made the area secure. 
  President al-Bashir announced the government's commitment to 
transport and settle them in their areas, and to support them 
with agricultural equipment, seeds, and everything necessary for 
their agricultural activities. He said that the government will 
remain committed to providing them with food until their harvest 
is ready. He also announced that the government will extend 
health services, increase the supply of medicine, open schools, 
and provide teachers to the villages of those who return. 
President al-Bashir called on the citizens of the Nubah 
Mountains to rebuild their places of worship, in all their 
different denominations. 
  The president had earlier addressed tens of thousands of the 
inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains. They had gathered at the 
al- Hilal Stadium in Omdurman to express their support for and 
allegiance to President al-Bashir and his government for 
granting them a state of their own, within the framework of the 
federal system announced in Sudan. 
  Their new state is called South Kordofan, and like all the 
other newly established Sudanese states, it has a governor, a 
ministerial council for the administration of executive duties, 
and a mini- parliament to keep watch on the government and its 
performance, and to enforce the necessary laws. 
  The inhabitants of the Nubah Mountains, in their speech made 
at the meeting, paid tribute to the government of the national 
salvation. They declared their support for the revolution and 
its orientation, and said that they will reconstruct their areas 
and make them peaceful and productive. They also declared 
support for peace and the government's endeavors to establish 
peace. The Nubah Mountains were part of the state of Kordofan, 
which was subdivided into three states within the federal 
government framework: South Kordofan, which covers all the areas 
of the Nubah Mountains, North Kordofan, and West Kordofan.

  [Text] Cairo, May 3 (AFP) -- The signing of a final 
agreement to launch Palestinian self-rule, due on Wednesday [4 
May], could be delayed because Israel has triggered a 
last-minute crisis, PLO delegates warned here Tuesday. 
  They charged Israel had reneged on several points of the 
deal 
for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  "The climate of the negotiations is not satisfactory because 
the Israeli side has gone back on several points," one of the 
delegates, Jamil al-Tarifi, said. 
  Another delegate warned that the PLO would "not give in 
under 
pressure, even if that means that the accord will not be signed 
tomorrow." 
  Israel is trying to squeeze last-minute concessions out of 
the Palestinians because the signing has already been scheduled 
for Wednesday, he explained, declining to be named. 
  "The Israelis have retracted on 24 points, including some of 
the promises made last week by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres such as the right of the Palestinians to issue stamps for 
(letters sent) abroad," he said. 
  Delegates charged that Israel had also changed its stand on 
Palestinian authority in al-Mawasi, next to the Jewish 
settlements of Gush Katif in the southern Gaza Strip. 
  Amid the reports of a crisis, the PLO chief negotiator on 
security issues, General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, went for 
consultations with officials at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat were to hold talks here later Tuesday. 
  Their task was to resolve final differences over the size of 
an autonomous Jericho, and the symbolic presence of a 
Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge linking Jordan to 
the West Bank. 
  The signing ceremony set for Wednesday is to be attended by 
dozens of foreign ministers and more than 2,000 guests. 
  It was being seen as a personal triumph for Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak, who has toiled to keep the autonomy 
deal on track through months of tortuous negotiations, mostly in 
Cairo.

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 1 May -- Two political advisers at the 
National Assembly have agreed that the visit currently being 
paid to Arab Maghreb countries by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir 
al-Sabah, the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
was a new and serious turning-point in Kuwait's foreign policy 
toward anti-coalition countries. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy 'Abdallah al-Shayiji said that the visit had the 
support of the National Assembly, which was consulted on the 
contents and aims of the visit -- this would increase the 
chances of its success. He said that al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, 
the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister would brief 
the Foreign Affairs Committee at the National Assembly at the 
end of his tour on the outcome of his talks with officials in 
the countries he had visited. 
  He added that the anti-coalition countries should not be 
dealt with in one way due to the variation in their stances from 
the early days of the Iraqi aggression until the subsequent 
liberation. These countries should be divided into categories 
and dealt with separately in a way that suited the amount of 
damage they have caused to the State of Kuwait. 
  Al-Shayiji said that those countries could be categorized as 
follows: A category that includes Arab Maghreb countries, a 
second category that includes Sudan, a third that includes 
Yemen, and a fourth category that includes the PLO and Jordan. 
He clarified that the first category was prepared at this stage 
for an intensive Kuwaiti move at all official, popular, 
academic, and media levels through delegations that would 
exchange visits between the two sides. 
  Deputy Dr. 'Abd al-Ridha al-'Asiri said that it was high 
time 
Kuwait reformulated the national target of its foreign policy 
and to look to the future from the nation's interest rather than 
emotions. He added that the foreign minister's visit was a 
change in tactics and not in strategy. 
  Dr. al-'Asiri called for a united stance by legislative and 
executive powers regarding Kuwait's foreign policy through 
dialogue and consultation between the government and the 
National Assembly before any step is taken in this regard. 
  Al-'Asir said that the success of the foreign minister's 
visit would depend on the Arab Maghreb countries support for all 
UN resolutions against Iraq, including the recognition of the 
new border demarcation between Iraq and Kuwait, and the return 
of POWs and detainees held in Iraqi prisons, and the recognition 
of international legitimacy. 
  Al-Shayiji said that the Foreign Affairs Committee at the 
Kuwaiti National Assembly was in the process of preparing a 
working paper on Kuwait's foreign policy for the next period, to 
be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion.

  [Text] Brother Ambassador Badr Hammam, Egypt's assistant 
foreign minister for Arab affairs and envoy of the Egyptian 
president, left Sanaa today following a working visit to our 
country that lasted several days. During the visit, Hammam 
delivered messages to Brothers Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, the Presidential Council chairman, and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
the Presidential Council vice chairman. 
  Before leaving Sanaa international airport, the Egyptian 
envoy made a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', in 
which he stressed the need for wisdom and logic to overcome the 
political crisis that the Yemeni Republic is passing through at 
this important phase in the Arab nation's history. 
  He said: At this phase, in which Yemen is passing through 
hard times for both Yemen and every Yemeni, we wish Yemen peace 
and tranquility. We must all remember that the recent incident 
in 'Imran between the soldiers of the one homeland should not 
forces us to deviate from the path that we all started with 
democratic discussions to proceed toward the goal that is dear 
to every Yemeni and Arab; namely, the preservation of the 
homeland's unity and its people's cohesion. 
  Ambassador Badr Hammam also stressed the need to provide a 
calm and appropriate atmosphere to start serious and programmed 
action to implement the pledge and accord document. He said the 
document is the correct path to establishing the state of unity 
with its institutions and constitutional and executive agencies 
so that Yemen and its people can begin a new era of security and 
stability in the young Yemeni Republic, under which progress and 
the comprehensive social and economic development can be 
achieved. 
  Hammam was seen off by Brother Ibrahim al-Sa'idi, Foreign 
Ministry under secretary; a representative from the Presidential 
protocol department; and Brother 'Ata Harun, the Egyptian 
ambassador in Sanaa.

<F P=106> [Report on a speech by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the </F>
Labor party caucus by Yo'el Nir in Jerusalem on 2 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Nir] Before his session with the Labor caucus, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told reporters that he does not 
give a damn about the opposition. They do not have to come up 
with answers, therefore they engage in demagoguery, Rabin said. 
  In the meeting, however, Rabin indirectly addressed himself 
to the charges against his policy made also by members of his 
own party. He used very stern language against them and was 
very determined when he spoke about what can be called the 
ideology behind his policy, even if some charge that his policy 
does not have an ideology. We do not want to rule another 
nation, he said. I want a Palestinian entity which is less than 
a state, but separate from us. We pay with blood for our ruling 
over another nation which does not want our rule. 
  [Rabin] I want a separate Palestinian entity to be set up. 
I do not want them inside the State of Israel. Our rule over 
another nation has corrupted us. Look at our economy and its 
dependence on them. We must for once take a risk for a change 
in order to free ourselves from this. 
  [Nir] Our great victory in the War of Independence was the 
establishment of a single-nation state. Annexing the 
territories would mean a binational state. The problem, 
however, is not the territories. Had the territories been empty 
of people, I would have no argument with anyone regarding 
greater Israel, Rabin said. Answering a question by Avigdor 
Qahalani regarding the Jewish settlement in the territories, 
mainly in the Jordan Rift Valley and on the Golan, Rabin said: 
  [Rabin] The settlements are today of marginal security 
value. The problem is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The only 
one which provides Israel with security is the IDF. I am 
furious today because I have to employ a standing paratroop 
regiment in the heart of Hebron, to protect 415 Jews, instead of 
using it in the war against terrorism. I have troops pinned 
down in the protection of settlements today instead of having 
them fighting terror. 
  [Nir] Regarding Syria, Rabin said that today it is the only 
strategic threat against Israel, though a moderate one. Peace 
with Syria is essential, Rabin said, but not at any price. 
  [Rabin] Let me ask you: I know that some day I will not be 
prime minister; I know what political stalemate can breed. I 
would not like to see in the future a strategic axis of 
Damascus, Baghdad, and Tehran -- not in two years, but perhaps 
in five or seven years. I am not saying that stalemate 
immediately means war, but I know what stalemate does breed. 
  [Nir] The prime minister reiterated the motto of this 
evening's address: The price of ruling over a foreign nation. 
  [Rabin] What can we do? Peace cannot be forced on anyone. 
One can decide: I want to stay here as an occupying ruler. I 
am telling you, the price we pay with blood is the result of our 
control over a foreign nation. The time has come for this to be 
said. If the public wants to control another nation, it must be 
told that we will pay with blood for this. It is not a matter 
of this or another government; it is a question of policy. I am 
telling you: The IDF is being stretched to its limits, mainly 
the regular army, and is making efforts to protect both the 
population in the territories and the Green Line. This is the 
Army's responsibility. I gave the order to fortify the Green 
Line at the expense of other missions in order to prevent the 
recurrence of incidents in 'Afula and Hadera. Elon More [West 
Bank settlement] does not protect 'Afula; the IDF, the Shin Bet, 
the police do. This must be stated once and for all.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Jordan will not attend the signing in Cairo 
on Wednesday of an agreement between the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) and Israel to implement Palestinian self-rule 
in the Israeli-occupied territories, officials said Monday. A 
senior Jordanian official told the JORDAN TIMES that the Kingdom 
had "apologised and will not send anyone to the signing 
ceremony." 
  Representatives of around 40 countries are expected to 
attend 
the signing of the self-rule agreement by PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzaq Rabin. 
  The official, who asked for anonymity, would not elaborate 
on 
the reasons for Jordan's absence from the Cairo ceremony, but 
analysts believed it was to underline Jordan's displeasure at 
the lack of coordination with the PLO. 
  Other political sources, however, said they believed that 
the 
Jordanian decision was largely dictated by its declared policy 
of keeping a low profile in the Middle East peace negotiations 
until the Kingdom's demand for an end to the interception of 
al-'Aqabah-bound ships is met. 
  But other sources also maintain that Jordan is "displeased 
at 
being marginalised in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, and 
some of the points in the agreemnt have implications on Jordan 
without its taking part in any of the decisions reached." 
  After Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of 
Principles 
on the White House lawn Sept. 13, King Husayn had said the 
Kingdom "will not be party to an agreement involving Jordan 
without having a role" in the negotiations. Jordan has also 
often criticised the PLO for not coordinating its position with 
the Kingdom before reaching agreements with Israel. 
  Jordan has abstained from an active role in the Middle East 
peace process until the Kingdom's demand for an end to the 
interception of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels is satisfactorily met. 
  This week, the Kingdom sent a lone observer to the 
multilateral working group on disarmament in Qatar and earlier 
this month Jordan sent only an observer to a meeting of the 
multilateral working group on water in Oman. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, after a meeting 
with King Husayn in London last Monday, announced that "subject 
to fine-tuning" Washington has accepted a Jordanian proposal 
under which Lloyds Register in London will be in charge of a 
sanction-verification regime at al-'Aqabah port. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN TIMES 
then that despite the fact that Washington's acceptance "removed 
a major obstacle" from the way of renewed Jordanian 
participating in negotiations, the Kingdom was awaiting final 
agreement and implementation of the al-'Aqabah arrangement 
before assuming its role in the talks. 
  Other senior officials have since then said that the Kingdom 
needs to be reassured that its sovereignty and territorial 
integrity would not be brought into question in any proposed 
modality for the sanctions-verifications procedures. They said 
Jordan had certain "reservations and firm positions" in the 
modalities and mechanism of the proposed arrangement. 
  AFP adds from Cairo: Syria will not attend the signing of 
the 
Palestinian autonomy accord, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
said Monday. "I do not think Syria's Foreign Minister (Faruq 
al-Shar') will attend the ceremony," Mr. Musa told reporters. 
  Damascus has criticised the PLO-Israeli deal on limited 
autonomy as a "separate deal" undermining Arab solidarity and 
Syria's quest for "global peace." 
  In Tunis, Palestinian officials said PLO Political 
Department 
chief Faruq Qaddumi had also turned down an invitation from 
Egypt to attend the ceremony. 
  Mr. Qaddumi, who has expressed reservations over the deal, 
refused to attend the historic Sept. 13 ceremony at the White 
House, when the PLO and Israel signed the declaration of 
principles opening the way for autonomy. 
  In total 50 Palestinian officials were invited to the 
ceremony, including former chief negotiator Haydar 'Abd al-Shafi 
and spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, Palestinian officials said. An 
Egyptian diplomat, said many Arab officials had agreed to 
attend, including the foreign ministers of Morocco, Qatar, 
Tunisia and Oman.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 25 -- Nearly three billion US 
dollars worth of foreign investment has already been promised in 
the minerals sector in the country, Commerce Minister Pranab 
Mukherjee said here today. 
  Inaugurating a three-day international round table 
conference 
on foreign investment in exploration and mining in India, Mr 
Mukherjee said the Government had taken major steps to encourage 
direct foreign investment in the newly opened minerals sector 
after the amendment of the Mines and Minerals (Regulations and 
Development) Act. 
  Fifteen major minerals and 21 minor minerals are now open 
for 
investments in mining and exploration by foreign investors with 
equity participation upto 51 per cent, he said. 
  The Commerce Minister maintained that to encourage direct 
foreign investment the Government has brought about major 
changes in fiscal, industrial, trade and import-export policies, 
and opening up of the mining sector is only a part of the 
ongoing process. 
  Mr Mukherjee assured the foreign participants, representing 
the world's largest mining companies from about 10 nations, that 
present national policies were based on consensus and did not 
depend on changes in the political leadership. "India's 
democracy is transparent, agile and vibrant supported by a 
vigilant press and independent judiciary", he added. 
  He reminded the prospective foreign investors that way back 
when Indian banks were nationalised, foreign banks were not 
touched at that time. India has never failed in its debt 
repayment upto now and situation has become much better with 
regard to foreign exchange reserves, he added. 
  The Minister said the Indian economy is the world's seventh 
largest with the third largest pool of technical manpower and 
professional managers. India has a large network of railways 
and seaports and other infrastructure facilities - like the 
powerful stock exchange system with 25 stock markets and 6,250 
registered companies, which are available for collaboration. 
  He said already seven power projects are being set up in the 
country by foreign investors. Nearly 34 industrial sectors are 
open for foreign investment and collaboration. 
  Welcoming the delegates, Minister of State for Mines Balram 
Singh Yadav said the objective of the three-day conference is to 
familiarise investors with the mining potential offered by India 
and to present a forum for interaction between investors and the 
Central Government, the State Governments, the public and 
private sector units, Geological Survey of India, Indian Bureau 
of Mines and other agencies concerned with the minerals sector. 
  The Minister said potential areas for mining ventures are 
where exploration activities during the last four decades have 
resulted in identification of large resources, specially of iron 
ore, bauxite, chromite and manganese, as also several medium and 
small deposits of other mineral commodities. These resources 
have not yet been mined to their fullest extent largely for want 
of capital and appropriate technology and provide a ready 
opportunity for profitable investment in the mining sector, he 
added. 
  He maintained that over 94 per cent of India's area has 
already been mapped by the Geological Survey of India so that 
preliminary data is available for further development. 
Technical consultancy and geological services are also provided 
in the area of mining and preparation of geological plans by the 
Indian Bureau of Mines on a commercial basis. 
  Speaking on the occasion, Mr I. G. Thingran, Secretary, 
Ministry of Mines, said in the new deregulated environment which 
is investment friendly foreign investors would find great scope 
for investment in exploration and mining in India. 
  Many countries like China, France and Australia are already 
cooperating with India in the mining sector, he said.

  [Text] A special Egyptian unit has returned to Cairo from 
the United States where it received training under the 
supervision of U.S. agencies on operations requiring more 
sophisticated training than could be provided by Egyptian 
security agencies. The units were trained at the expense of an 
oil-rich Arab country. 
  Competent U.S. quarters did not deny that the units' future 
tasks would include the execution of operations outside Egyptian 
boundaries for the United States or the state that has financed 
the units' training. It has been rumored here that among the 
expected or scheduled operations may be one or more in Sudan 
against the ruling Islamic Front and some of its leaders. The 
expected operations in Sudan will particularly target Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, who has been accused by foreign and certain Arab 
quarters of financing and leading extremist fundamentalist 
movements. 
  Usamah Bin-Ladin announced in Sudan that he has joined the 
Saudi opposition movement in London and that he supports its 
objectives. Bin-Ladin's announcement came in reaction to the 
Saudi authorities' withdrawal of his Saudi passport. 
  Western circles believe that part of the al-Shaykh religious 
family in Saudi Arabia supports and finances the opposition.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Hasan Sabra: "Butrus-Ghali, Listen to the </F>
Bosnians"] 
  [Text] "If you have any honor, you should resign." This is 
what Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali following the barbaric Serbian attack on 
Gorazde. 
  We cannot but congratulate the Bosnian president for his 
words to the UN secretary general, although we are confident 
that the latter will not heed Izetbegovic's advice for obvious 
reasons of which the secretary general is aware. 
  The secretary general is in the habit of denouncing any 
legitimate operation mounted by dispossessed Palestinians 
against the Jewish usurpers in the land of Palestine, equating 
such actions with the attacks the Zionists wage against 
Palestinians, Lebanese, and Arabs everywhere every day. Such a 
man, of course, will hardly find fault in the failure of the UN 
forces to perform their simplest duty in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
that of stopping the massacres against the inhabitants of that 
country. 
  We never thought the secretary general likely to deviate 
from 
the Western line of thinking and decision-making. 
Butrus-Ghali's elevation to his current job was, after all, a 
reward for certain policies of which he and the Egyptian regime 
are aware. The day Butrus-Ghali defies Western--more 
specifically American--wishes will certainly be his last on the 
job. Nor do we hope for a UN secretary general who is not of 
Butrus-Ghali's type in the foreseeable future. 
  We do not think that Butrus-Ghali's being Orthodox makes him 
sympathetic to the Orthodox Serbians in their continuous and 
barbaric aggression against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We do not think that ethnic bias taints his position in the 
Muslim- Serbian strife. 
  The secretary general, an Arab, will understand the meaning 
of the Arab saying: "Do not flaunt your sins." Is there a 
worse sin against ethics, values, and human rights than to 
remain silent when you monitor and know, even beforehand, the 
massacres the Serbs are perpetrating against Bosnians, whose 
only crime was to want a separate home of their own. 
  We did not need to wait for the UN's silence about Serbian 
crimes to reach Izetbegovic's conclusion. We long ago made up 
our minds about the secretary general--an Arab, to our lasting 
shame. 
  Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who fully backs Western and U.S. 
persecution of Iraq, its people, and its children through an 
embargo of which innocent Iraqis bear the brunt? The real 
criminals are still free in Iraq, and living very well at the 
expense of their downtrodden people. 
  Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who condoned, and still 
condones, 
U.S.-Israeli pressure on a weak and defeatist Palestinian 
leadership? The latter is now set to cooperate in the 
liquidation of the Arab-Zionist conflict, an outcome that suits 
Western, particularly U.S., interests. 
  Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who condones Zionist crimes and 
the way in which the United States backs these crimes at the UN 
Security Council? 
  Would this secretary general ever tell us what he thinks 
when 
he sees UN resolutions trampled under the feet of the Zionists, 
the West, and the United States, particularly those resolutions 
concerning the Arab-Zionist conflict? These are resolutions 
that merely aim to deter Israel, psychologically at least, from 
attacking Arab children, women, and men. 
  We did not await Butrus-Ghali's silence about the Serbian 
barbarism in Bosnia-Herzegovina to say to the man: Speak up and 
walk out. He made up his mind a long time ago. Since the 
moment he got on the payroll of the United Nations he become an 
employee of the U.S. Administration. He takes his orders from 
the United States, particularly in matters involving the 
flogging of his fellow Arabs and Third World wretches, doomed to 
live under the U.S. thumb. 
  Butrus-Ghali came to office to follow orders. If he does 
not, he will lose his job. And he knows that. He would not 
want to trouble his remaining days with moral questions or 
ethical considerations that only bother prophets, and he is not 
one.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 30 Apr (INA) -- The Arab workers' rally 
for solidarity with the workers and peoples of Iraq, Palestine, 
and the Libyan Jamahiriyah began here today under the slogan: 
"Arab Workers Take a Firm Position in the Trench of Great Iraq, 
Palestine, and the Libyan Jamahiriyah." The rally will last two 
days. 
  President Saddam Husayn's representative Taha Yasin Ramadan, 
member of the Revolution Command Council and vice president, 
delivered a speech in which he conveyed his excellency the 
president's appreciation of all Arab workers for their 
initiatives to defend Arab issues. [passage omitted] 
  He said the Arab nation is facing the most dangerous and the 
largest of aggressions, designed to liquidate the Palestine 
question and conspire against Iraq, the Libyan Jamahiriyah, 
Yemen's unity, and Sudan's unity. This, he said, requires a 
distinguished militant move by the free and militant sons of the 
Arab nation to support the militant positions of these 
countries, which are bravely resisting and standing firmly 
against the aggressions and conspiracies of the enemies and 
their agents. 
  Ramadan stressed that pan-Arab responsibility requires us to 
stand by the nation and the right regardless of sacrifices, to 
do what is right for the coming generations, and to be loyal to 
all Arab values and divine messages. [passage omitted] 
  He praised the steadfastness of the Libyan Jamahiriyah's 
people in the face of the unjust blockade, as well as their 
refusal to bow to hostile designs. He hailed the great Somali 
victory over the U.S.-led foreign invasion forces, the strong 
Yemeni unity, and Sudan's steadfastness in the face of 
conspiracies targeting its independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity. [Passage omitted]

Reviews Position on Baghdad"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Unified 
Iraqi National Congress held an expanded meeting to study the 
position on the Iraqi scene and review the position of Iraqi 
opposition organizations. Elsewhere, it has been announced in 
Baghdad that senior Iraqi officials have joined a new military 
and political organization called the "Saddamites Union" led by 
the Iraqi president's son 'Udayy. 
  The National Congress (the Iraqi opposition's main 
apparatus) 
held an expanded meeting in its headquarters in Salah al-Din, 
north Iraq, last Tuesday. A statement issued by the congress, a 
copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, said that the 
meeting was attended by Mas'ud Barzani and Major General Hasan 
al-Naqib, members of the congress' presidential council, in 
addition to the chairman of the executive council and a number 
of its members and some members of the consultative 
constitutional council and the national society. The meeting 
discussed critical domestic conditions, ways of bringing about 
change, international developments affecting the Iraqi scene, 
and ways of toppling the dictatorial regime in Baghdad. 
  The congress' statement pointed out that the meeting 
condemned the regime's repressive practices, which have been 
stepped up recently in the center and the south. [passage

  [Text] Tehran, May 2, IRNA -- [Words indistinct] formed a 
"defence committee" aimed at foiling attacks by the 
Baghdad-based terrorist Mujahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO), a 
weekly disclosed here Monday. The bi-lingual weekly 'KAYHAN 
HAVA'I' in its latest issue further wrote that the committee, in 
its first reaction to MKO attacks on foreigners in Iraq, has 
requested the Iraqi government to provide more security to 
foreign diplomats based in that country. 
  "Over the past few months, foreign diplomatic missions in 
Iraq, including the Iranian Embassy, have complained about 
increasing terrorist attacks and the plunder of their property 
by the MKO," according to the weekly. 
  It referred to March 22 incident in which four shots were 
fired by MKO assailants at Djibouti's charge d'affaires in Iraq, 
stealing of an Iranian embassy vehicle a few days after the 
incident and December assassination of Caglar Yucel, the 
administrative attache of the Turkish Embassy saounding [as 
received] of a second man as examples of MKO attacks on foreign 
diplomatic missions in Iraq.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 May (INA) -- The Iraqi newspapers issued 
today reiterate their vehement denunciation of the hostile U.S. 
Administration position on Iraq and its disregard of the 
international community's will to lift the blockade on the Iraqi 
people. 
  The newspapers AL-THAWRAH, AL-JUMHURIYAH, and BABIL 
emphasize 
that the White House policy on Iraq indicates a clear ignorance 
of the logic of events, of the pillars of relations, and of 
interests as well as a disregard of both the U.S. interests and 
the exits to the U.S. markets. 
  In the "Standpoint" column, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH, which 
expresses the views of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says: 
The picture at the Security Council is clear now. Only the 
United States opposes lifting the embargo when China, France, 
and Russia are making pressures to lift it. Britain 
acknowledged that Iraq is cooperating with the Security Council. 
  AL-THAWRAH recalls what Washington imposed on its allies as 
well as the U.S. issuance, in the Security Council's name, of 
unfair resolutions against Iraq. The paper adds that after 
Ekeus acknowledged before the Security Council that Iraq is 
cooperating with it, the United States stood against the 
international community's will, refused to implement Paragraph 
22 of Resolution 687, and called for maintaining the blockade on 
Iraq. 
  The paper draws the U.S. Administration's attention to the 
fact that the international community is no longer capable of 
following the U.S. policy indefinitely. The world is aware that 
Iraq is a key player in the region and that it should be 
addressed with rationality, patience, and good intentions 
because any form of aggression or threats against Iraq are 
useless. The paper urges the United States to adopt a different 
policy toward Iraq; one that would take into account realities, 
peoples' interests, and the international community's will. 
  The newspaper BABIL says that the U.S. position is becoming 
more intransigent against Iraq at a time when the international 
circles are witnessing increased cries and positions denouncing 
the continued unfair economic blockade on Iraq. The paper adds: 
Some influential members of the Security Council and the United 
Nations support both the international law and the Security 
Council resolutions which Iraq committed itself to implement. 
The Iraqi commitment was acknowledged by the Special Commission 
entrusted with international inspection. Thus, the only 
explanation of the U.S. position is what we, in Iraq, knew from 
the very beginning, that is, this position is a hostile and 
conspiratorial one. 
  BABIL points out that with some signs appearing that many 
international community circles are stressing the need for the 
Security Council to fulfill its pledges to Iraq by issuing 
resolutions lifting the oil embargo on it, the U.S. 
Administration is no longer capable of using, as a pretext, the 
international laws and human rights. This administration has 
rancorously revealed its evil intentions about not fulfilling 
its obligations to Iraq. 
  BABIL emphasizes that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
could not endure this new state of affairs, so he visited the 
region to meet with agents and with the afraid and shivering 
ones and reassure them that the United States would always stand 
against Iraq and its people. The paper points to Christopher's 
article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES which contained a host 
of lies that even the ordinary man in the street can no longer 
believe. BABIL explains that this criminal U.S. position can 
only receive further denunciation from the good ones and 
conscientious people in the world. 
  The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH describes the Clinton 
administration's policy on Iraq as resembling someone who fights 
his own kinsfolk and stands against his people's interests. 
Pointing out that the repercussions and damage resulting from 
the blockade have extended outside Iraq and affected the 
interests of Turkey, Jordan, and many European states such as 
Germany, France, Spain, and Britain, the paper says that the 
blockade inflicted grave damage on the Americans themselves 
after it closed the doors to a market that used to import 
one-fifth of the U.S. rice production in addition to large 
quantities of grains, animal fodder, and other goods. 
  Discussing the large U.S. trade deficit with world states 
last year, which amounts to $115.8 billion, the paper says that 
the Clinton administration, under Zionist pressures and 
individual interests, deliberately closes the doors to Americans 
who wish to deal with Iraq, which has a tremendous ability to 
accommodate goods and services. 
  Comparing the size of U.S. trade with Iraq and other states, 
AL-JUMHURIYAH says that U.S. trade figures show that the overall 
imports of U.S. goods by Syria, Bahrain, Oman, and Jordan did 
not reach $1.5 billion and that Iraqi imports, during the period 
of peak transactions with the United States, exceeded this 
figure. Indicating that Iraq's imports of U.S. grains exceeded 
$1 billion in 1989 and in the preceding year, the paper says 
that, thanks to its huge ability to accommodate goods, Iraq 
alone can import U.S. commodities worth more than one-half of 
the U.S. exports to all Arab countries. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH urges the Clinton administration to review its 
policy and deal with Iraq through a rational logic based on 
respecting sovereignty, abandoning both bigotry and hostility, 
and looking forward to balanced trade relations. The paper adds 
that there is still an opportunity for the White House 
administration if it is aware of both the regional situation and 
the U.S. interests in it.

<F P=106> ["From the Heart" column by Ghazi al-'Ayyash: "The Internal </F>
Blockade"] 
  [Text] Having come to realize the true objectives of the 
external blockade imposed by the United States, Britain, and 
world Zionism on Iraq, Iraqi citizens are no longer greatly 
affected by this blockade. By their oppressive blockade, the 
United States and Britain cannot harm the Iraqi people more than 
they did through their unethical and inhuman practices, criminal 
aggression, and destruction of Iraq's economic, industrial, and 
health infrastructure. Moreover, the Iraqi people possess and 
will continue to possess an exceptional ability to hold firm, 
endure, and fight. This is because any comparison between 
losing their identity and freedom on the one hand, and holding 
on to patience and defiance to achieve the objectives for which 
they have offered great sacrifices on the other, will make them 
choose endless defiance and patience. Actually, what hurts and 
pains the Iraqi citizens are the practices of some of their 
fellow citizens and the painful internal blockade that they have 
been imposing. Driven by greed and a tendency to exploit 
others, these people have lost all principles and morals. This 
blockade is being exercised by people who once were penniless 
and are now rich, who once were hungry and now are overfed. 
These people will not be pardoned by their fellow citizens. He 
who creates his wealth and luxury from illegal money and at the 
expense of others' hunger and need will not enjoy his life, for 
it is wrong to believe that sources of wealth are inexhaustible 
and that one can do without others. 
  Certain people's practices against their fellow citizens 
have 
been exposed and their justifications found unacceptable. They 
are like spiders extending their webs to trap the citizens. 
Deep in their souls, which are dominated by greed and 
parasitism, there exists the same criminal instinct of the 
spider, which kills its own offspring. 
  Certain greengrocers and grocers have turned the highway 
pavement around Baghdad into a black market to avoid the prices 
fixed by the government. They have emptied the Baghdad markets 
of everything. Tomatoes, potatoes, beans, everything is piled up 
on the highway pavement. They are not piled up by peasants or 
owners of nearby farms, as some may think. Rather, they are 
carried from markets and groceries to occupy the highway 
pavement, where tomatoes are sold at 35 dinars instead of 20 
dinare per kilo, potatoes sold at 75 dinars instead of 30, and 
peas at 15 dianrs instead of 10. The quantities of beans that 
appeared recently left cold storage plants only after their 
prices were raised. The price of anything with a fixed price 
has been deliberately raised. The price has also been raised 
for any material that citizens tend to buy as a substitute for 
the expensive meat. Had the potatoes stored in in cold storage 
plants been released, they would have met citizens needs for at 
least three months, and would have brought their prices even 
lower than the fixed price. 
  Committees, which would be called "emergency committees," 
should be set up and given extensive authorities to impose tough 
punitive measures against violators. Such committees would not 
only monitor markets or greengroceries, but also cold storage 
plants. Weekly inventories of the contents of such plants 
should be carried out. No materials needed by the market should 
be allowed to be hoarded there. Such committees should also be 
given the authority to take to account any peasants who, upon 
the instructions of greengrocers, delay the collection of their 
crops to raise their prices. Another type of committees should 
be set up to monitor the domestic commodities poured into the 
market. There should be a balance between the cost of each 
commodity and the price at which it is sold. This is because if 
it is left up the managements of factories to specify the 
prices, and in view of the continued, unjustified price hikes, 
the citizen will be only the victim. Setting up "emergency 
committees" relying on citizens' consciences and cooperation 
will have a great effect in deterring the hoarders of basic 
supplies and vegetables.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 May (INA) -- Reliable sources in Iraq's 
Kurdistan have stated that the two U.S. helicopters, which were 
downed over northern Iraq last month, were carrying a team of 
experts from the Pentagon, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 
and the Zionist Mosad. 
  Informed Kurdish sources informed the newspaper 
AL-JUMHURIYAH 
that among the people killed were five agent Kurdish elements 
known for their links to the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence 
circles. They explained that the five dead Kurds were Salih 
Sa'id, a translator, born in 1962; 'Abd-al-Sattar 'Arab, born in 
1969; Nadir Mikhu, born in 1964; Ghandi Husayn, born in 1968; 
and Ahmad Muhammad Sulayman, born in 1956. These elements were 
carrying extremely important reports which were to be discussed 
in a meeting in Salah al-Din, which was not convened due to the 
helicopters' downing. 
  The Kurdish sources asserted that the meeting in Salah 
al-Din 
was designed to expand the circle of conspiracy and discuss 
reports on proposals aimed at entrenching the separatist 
movement and detach Kurdistan from Iraq as part of the 
comprehensive fragmentation scheme prepared by U.S. and Zionist 
circles. The sources explained that many Mosad agents were 
present at the scene of the accident. A group was spotted, led 
by Marlin Bogos [name as received], who plays the role of 
coordinator, and Barbara Schell, political adviser to the forces 
of aggression in the Turkish base of Incerlik. 
  The newspaper sources revealed a U.S. report which was to be 
discussed during the Salah al-Din meeting. This report aims to 
entrench the United States in the region, loot the mineral 
resources in Iraq's Kurdistan, and transfer them to California 
under the supervision of scientists specialized in exploring 
uranium, gold, tin, and other minerals.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the </F>
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, by 'Adnan Husayn in London; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Husayn] Your said recently that you had asked 
some European governments to supply the government of the 
Kurdish region with weapons so that it can defend itself and to 
help it to train local police and security forces. Is that the 
main aim of your current tour? 
  [Talabani] It is one of several aims. I discussed with the 
officials with whom I met all the issues related to Iraq, 
including the Kurdish issue. [passage omitted] 
  [Husayn] What was their response as regards armament and 
training of police and security forces? 
  [Talabani] They were understanding and sympathetic. In 
France in particular, the position was understanding and 
encouraging -- which prompted me to be more optimistic. 
  [Husayn] And how do you think Turkey will react to your 
armament? 
  [Talabani] I do not know exactly. I believe it will not 
agree. 
  [Husayn] And Iran? 
  [Talabani] It will strongly oppose it. It will consider it 
an imperialist Zionist conspiracy...through to the descriptions 
the Iranian press is so good at when it comes to making up lies 
and fabrications about anything to which it is opposed. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Husayn] The war between the Turkish Government and the 
Kurdish Workers' Party has intensified in recent months, and 
Turkish forces do not hesitate to carry out operations inside 
Iraqi Kurdistan. You opposed that, but what have you done to 
prevent it? 
  [Talabani] We have made great efforts with the two parties 
to prevent the fighting from being moved to our areas. We asked 
the Kurdish Workers' Party to operate away from our areas, and 
we asked Turkey to leave to us the task of guarding and 
protecting the border on the Iraqi side. But the two sides have 
taken account of that and continue to violate the sanctity of 
Iraqi territory. [passage omitted] 
  [Husayn] There are reports that the Iraqi Government is 
seeking to resume negotiations with you over self-rule, that it 
has expressed willingness even to accept the federal formula 
proposed by you, and that France and Turkey tried to mediate 
between you. Is there any possibility of resuming the 
negotiations? 
  [Talabani] First of all I would like to stress that neither 
France nor Turkey has spoken with us in this connection, either 
directly or indirectly. All that has been said in this 
connection is baseless. The essence of our current position is 
that the Kurdish movement and the Kurdish people in Iraq have an 
elected parliament and a government. And that this movement and 
this people are part of the Iraqi opposition movement. Any 
dialogue or negotiations with the government must be decided by 
the two councils representing the Iraqi opposition and the 
Kurdish people. I mean the Executive Council of the Unified 
Iraqi National Congress and the national assembly (parliament) 
of the Kurdistan region. I personally believe that there is no 
hope or benefit from a dialogue with the Saddam regime, with 
which we tried dialogue and negotiations in the past and even 
recently. As is known, I have since 1963 led and participated 
in negotiations with successive Iraqi governments. After all 
this time, I have reached a firm conviction, namely that there 
can be no solution to any of Iraq's numerous problems -- 
including the Kurdish problem -- without the establishment of a 
democratic system in Baghdad. The Saddam regime in particular 
does not want a solution to these problems, so "whoever tries it 
will regret it."

tour the possibility of providing arms for the Iraqi Kurds. He 
said that the results of his talks with French President 
Francois Mitterrand were "excellent." [passge ommitted] 
  He said that the talks at the Elysee and with Defense 
Minister Leotard covered "the possibility of France training 
security and police forces of the Kurdish region for the 
protection of the inhabitants and foreigners living there," most 
of whom work for relief organizations. He added that "the reply 
was positive and Paris promised to study the matter, along the 
same lines as the Palestinian police forces" which will go to 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area and which receive 
international aid within the framework of the autonomy 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  He said that he discussed with the European officials "the 
possibility of getting defensive weapons" and the exemption of 
northern Iraq from the military embargo imposed on Iraq since 
its invasion of Kuwait. He added that the training of Kurdish 
police was one of the topics he discussed in Germany. He 
stressed that Bonn is "showing special interest in the Kurdish 
issue" in general and is preparing an initiative for the 
settlement of the Kurdish problem in Turkey "in the context of a 
political solution that would safeguard that country's unity." 
[passage omitted] 
  On the rumors about a Turkish mediation between Baghdad and 
the Iraqi Kurds, Talabani said: "We have not been officially 
informed of Ankara's position." He added that he believes that 
Ankara wishes to normalize relations with Baghdad. Asked about 
the recent agreement between the two countries for the repair of 
the oil pipelines extending from Karkuk in northern Iraq to the 
Turkish coast, he replied: "Resumption of the export of Iraqi 
oil via Turkey would depend on a UN resolution (lifting the 
embargo) and also on a decision by the government of the region 
of Kurdistan." He pointed out that a part of the pipeline passes 
through the territory under the Kurdistan Front's control "and, 
therefore, a share of the royalties from that oil should go to 
the Kurdish people to be spent on administration, development, 
and payment of salaries" in northern Iraq." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Governorates (by AL-THAWRAH correspondents) -- The 
wheat and barley harvest for this season has begun in several 
governorates in the country. Various centers have been prepared 
and provided with all the necessary requirements to receive the 
crops. 
  In al-Basrah Governorate, the manual harvest of wheat and 
barley began in Saddamiyah, al-Qurnah, al-Nashwah, al-Dayr, and 
Shatt al- 'Arab. Latif Mahal Humud, governor of al-Basrah and 
chairman of the governorate's Higher Harvest and Marketing 
Committee, told AL-THAWRAH that those concerned with following 
up the affairs of the blessed campaign began early last Saturday 
[16 April] morning to supervise the manual harvest operations. 
  In Dhi Qar Governorate, the manual wheat and barley harvest 
has begun and the mechanized harvest of the two crops will begin 
on 15 April. This was announced by Salah 'Abbud Mahmud, 
governor of Dhi Qar and chairman of the committee supervising 
the harvest campaign in the governorate, during an expanded 
meeting of the agricultural committees and several peasants and 
farmers. The number of available harvesters and other 
agricultural tools in the administrative units has been checked, 
fuel has been secured, the officials who will supervise the 
campaign have been appointed, the prices of the yield per donum 
have been fixed, and peasants and farmers have been given the 
necessary instructions. 
  In Maysan, the manual and mechanical harvest of wheat and 
barley has begun with the help of 157 harvesters. The engineer 
director of the Maysan Agricultural Department said the 
department has formed central, branch, and field committees to 
follow up implementation of the campaign, the bases have been 
drawn up for ensuring alternatives to harvesters and other 
machinery, and the governorate has prepared five centers in the 
governorate's cities, districts and subdistricts to receive the 
crops. 
  In Babil, early preparations have been made to begin the 
general national campaign for the wheat and barley harvest. 
'Ali Hassun, president of the governorate's federation of 
cooperative societies, said 105 harvesters have been assigned to 
help in the campaign, saying the mechanical harvest will begin 
on 1 May. He said technical committees have been formed to 
supervise the progress of the campaign and to market the crops 
directly at the main centers which are distributed throughout 
the governorate. 
  In Wasit Governorate, Governor Tahir Jalil Habbush, chairman 
of the Higher Harvest and Marketing Committee, supervised the 
manual harvest of wheat and barley which began on 15 April with 
the help of 400 harvesters [as published]. The governor 
affirmed during his meeting with the peasants and farmers and 
the field followup committees the importance of exerting maximum 
efforts for the success of the campaign which, he said, enjoys 
the support and direct attention of leader President Saddam 
Husayn, and the need to avoid losses as much as possible in 
order to ensure food for the people and to foil the plot of the 
unjust blockade.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani received the Croatian 
prime minister Nikica Valentic today. 
  At the meeting, the president stressed the need for 
strengthening solidarity and further cooperation among the 
states in the Balkan region in order to confront aggressors and 
to consolidate peace and stability in that region. Condemning 
the aggression of the Serbs against Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said: 
Undoubtedly the fates of the Balkan region states are tied 
together, and peace and friendship in the region is to the 
benefit of all those states, just as cooperation and unity in 
the face of any aggression and sectarianism are to the detriment 
of enemies and aggressors and also guarantee the future 
stability and tranquillity of the region. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani considered the grounds for cooperation 
between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Croatia 
to be positive, and expressed the hope that the results of talks 
between the Croatian delegation and our country's officials 
smooth the way for further expansion of economic, commercial, 
and political ties between the two countries. 
  During the meeting, where First Deputy President Habibi was 
also present, the Croatian prime minister, declaring his 
country's support for the territorial integrity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, described the policy of the Serbian forces - 
who are supported by the superpowers - as aggressive and said: 
In history Croats and Bosnians have fought side by side against 
aggressors and have always lived in harmony. He added: The 
Croatian Government will make all efforts to eliminate the 
slight disputes between the Muslims and Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, since peace and stability in that region 
will be to the benefit of the two nations and other states. 
  The Croatian prime minister considered the results of his 
visit to Iran to be a turning point in the bilateral ties and 
expressed the hope that through the normalization of the 
conditions in the Balkan region and the punishment of the 
Serbian aggressors in that region through international forums 
the trend of expansion of ties between the Balkan states - 
especially Croatia - with Iran is accelerated. 
  At the meeting the Croatian prime minister extended an 
official invitation from his country's president to Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani to visit that country. The president, 
accepting the invitation, expressed the hope to visit Croatia 
and Bosnia at an opportune moment when the conditions are 
normalized in those two countries.

Herzegovina [B-H] Faruk Smjalbegovic met Iranian Minister of 
Finance and Economic Affairs Morteza Mohammad-Khani to discuss 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Smajlbegovic said most of the economic centers of B-H have 
been ruined in the war or are in the hands of Serbs, while most 
of the experts have been forced to leave their homeland. 
  He said the Islamic Republic of Iran can utilise the 
services 
of these Bosnian experts in different fields especially power 
and generation projects. 
  He said B-H now has need for oil and energy, and that for 
the 
time being the refineries of B-H are in the hands of the Serb 
aggressors. 
  The visiting official said Bosnia needs raw materials for 
production and foodstuffs to ensure life. 
  The Iranian minister, saying the Islamic Republic has 
supported B-H in all areas welcomed the cooperation of Bosnian

  [Text] In a banquet given in honor of the Vietnamese 
president on Saturday night, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
delivered a speech in which he described Vietnam as a country 
which enjoys a very good position in the minds of the Iranian 
people. He added: The period during which you defended your 
country and the acts of heroism undertaken by the Vietnamese 
people in the face of Western invaders have reached epic status 
in Iran. Your successes warmed the hearts of 
independence-seeking peoples throughout the world and you gave 
valuable historic lessons to humanity. 
  Our country's president expressed the hope that, during the 
period of reconstruction, too, the Vietnamese nation would 
continue to pursue the correct and independent path it has 
embarked on towards reforming its economic structure and that it 
would serve as a good model for the world's other countries with 
the cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran and through the 
exchange of experiences between the two revolutionary nations. 
  The Vietnamese president, for his part, delivered a speech 
in 
which he praised the Islamic Republic of Iran and the gains made 
by our country.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Is Still the Mother of All </F>
Evils of the Century"] 
  [Text] Today, 25 April, is the 14th anniversary of the 
disgraceful U.S. defeat at Tabas in the desert. In addition to 
being a testimonial to U.S. military ineptitude, this incident 
also brought home the reality that the U.S. hierarchy are savage 
aggressive individuals who trample on all international 
standards in order to attain their own illicit interests and do 
not obey even a single law. What has occurred all over the 
world for the past 14 years merely affirms the daily growth of 
their savagery. 
  The record of U.S. brutality in Vietnam, the deployment of 
its troops in Panama, Iraq, Somalia, its multifaceted support 
for the Zionists' atrocities in occupied Palestine, and the U.S. 
pressure on the United Nations to remain silent in the face of 
the Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, all these are evidence 
of U.S. barbarianism in past years. On the one hand, it 
professes to be a champion of human rights but with the other, 
it crushes human beings all over the world under its military 
boots. This is the true nature of the United States and of all 
of today's domineering powers. 
  The most serious and appropriate approach to such bestiality 
is the one the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted toward the 
United States. The occupation of the U.S. den of spies in 
Tehran by the student followers of the imam's line and the 
categorical stance taken by Imam Khomeyni against the U.S. 
Government on this incident and in all other cases is exactly 
the kind of treatment that the Americans merit. 
  Even today the Muslim nations who wish to live in freedom, 
who do not want their rights to be transgressed, who do not want 
their women and children to be massacred by the malicious 
enemies of Islam, have no recourse but to take up a serious and 
decisive struggle against the United States. 
  "The United States is the mother of all the evils of the 
century." The truth of this profound statement by Imam Khomeyni 
becomes clearer with the passage of every moment. What is 
happening today throughout the Islamic world from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kashmir, from Palestine to the Caucasus 
and Afghanistan, is all under the auspices of the criminal 
United States, the United Nations is a mere instrument in its 
hands. 
  Therefore, in order to lift the arms embargo from the 
Bosnian 
Muslims, to halt the Serbs' aggression in Gorazde, and to quell 
all the trouble making against the Muslims, one should fight 
against the United States and scorch the roots of its 
mischief-mongering. It is an immutable reality that "the United 
States is the mother of all evils of the century."

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] A new crisis has developed in Tehran-London ties 
following London's unfounded claims that Iran is backing the 
Irish Republican Army, IRA. The crisis in Iran-Britain 
diplomatic ties assumed a wider dimension when the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry -- in response to the accusations levelled by 
certain London officials against Iran -- handed over a protest 
note to the British charge d'affaires in Tehran, Geoffrey James. 
  In other sharp reactions, the Foreign Ministry's director 
general for Western Europe, Mr. 'Ali Ahani, and the Iranian 
charge d'affaires in Britain, Mr. Gholam Reza Ansari, while 
rejecting Britain's claims in this connection, considered as 
irresponsible that country's action, which has no evidence. 
  Tehran-London ties have always undergone fluctuations during 
the 15-year period since the victory of the Islamic revolution 
in Iran. As the record of these relations indicate, though 
Iran-Britain ties have been quite widespread on the economic 
front, such ties on the political dimension and within the 
diplomatic framework have always been influenced by various 
factors. Britain's constant siding with the U.S. in countering 
the Islamic revolution and pursuing policies aimed at isolating 
Iran on the international scene, as well as Britain's support 
for Salman Rushdie, the apostate writer of the blasphemous book 
"The Satanic Verses," are all factors worth pondering in this 
regard. 
  At present, too, it seems that by resorting to the old 
tactics in a new shape, under the title of concern over Iran's 
covert links with the IRA, British officials are trying to 
(experience) a new cold wave in the two countries' ties. 
Despite this, political observers believe that, though the 
outcome of the present crisis in Tehran-London ties is not 
predictable, it is possible that the London officials' 
insistence on continuing irresponsible conduct may neutralize 
the efforts that the two countries have made in opening a new 
phase in relations since last fall. 
  Tehran officials undoubtedly consider the recent act of 
British officials as being devoid of any logical justification 
and unacceptable, because, before reflecting London's concern 
over Tehran-IRA ties, it is considered as a reflection of 
Britain's domestic policy considerations and can only please 
those who want to benefit from the two countries' differences. 
This is a point not missed by the British press and several 
analysts have described the recent British act as a tool for 
justifying its defeat in the Northern Ireland peace talks. 
According to these analysts, British officials are now trying 
to link Ireland's republicans to a foreign country in order to 
deviate public opinion and prepare the ground for the success of 
the next round of the peace talks.

  [Text] London, May 2, IRNA -- The recent maneuvers of 
Britain and its imaginary claims of Iran's links with the Irish 
Republican Army (IRA), perhaps more than anything else indicates 
the problem with the government in London is afflicted in 
relation to Northern Ireland. 
  The British Government, in order to divert public attention 
from its failure to settle the Northern Ireland issue, does not 
refuse to engage in any trick and propaganda artifice in and 
outside Britain. 
  A glance at the past history of clashes in Ireland has 
symptoms of the defeat of British policies, both military and 
political, in this region and the continuous notoriety earned by 
responsible persons in England. 
  The shooting of any person suspected of terrorist operations 
is one sample of these policies. Perhaps the most conspicuous 
sample of British policy was the killing of three Irishmen 
suspected of membership in IRA in Gibraltar by British security 
forces in 1988. 
  After killing them, the British police found out that the 
three Irishmen were not busy laying bombs as suspected but in 
fact had no weapons with themselves. 
  The accident caused the families of the three murdered 
persons to file a complaint at European courts against the 
British Government for trampling on the second paragraph of the 
human rights convention of Europe. 
  The British Government does not have a good record at the 
European courts and since 1950, of the 52 files presented 
against Britain, the country has been condemned in 30 cases. 
  On the other hand in the opinion of many non-aligned 
observers the government of Britain has itself been one of the 
main causes of political chaos and violent actions in Northern 
Ireland. The secret researches performed by the government have 
also proved this true. 
  For example, the daily 'INDEPENDENT' last June disclosed 
certain aspects of these secret researches which portrayed the 
depth of discrimination against those Catholics of Northern 
Ireland who want independence from British colonialism. 
  On the basis of this report London's political-military 
control of Northern Ireland, has over the past 20 years led to 
gross inequality and the strengthening of the Protestants who 
support prolongation of British rule. 
  Statistical comparison between the two societies of Northern 
Ireland indicate high level of unemployment among Catholics at a 
rate that is twice as much as Protestants, in addition to 
striking differences in housing, hygiene, and education among 
the two groups. 
  In the opinion of the writers of this report, this is the 
direct result of the deliberate policies of London for enacting 
discrimination against those who want an end to its presence in 
the northern part of Ireland. 
  On the other hand despite the claims of the British 
Government for stopping clashes and armed encounters among the 
two groups in Northern Ireland, the statistics of those killed 
in these incidents indicate another bitter truth. 
  Statistics show that for the past seven years until 1993 
about 220 Protestants were killed by the republicans. This is 
while over the same period 368 republican Catholics were killed 
by armed groups who are advocates of English rule. 
  The British Government while showing itself inclined to 
peace 
to end the bloody clashes in Ireland has in fact, on many an 
occasion entered into coalition with rightist parties that are 
opposed to negotiations with the Catholics, and has considered 
many concessions for the Protestants in controlling Northern 
Ireland. 
  For instance, British Prime Minister John Major late last 
summer, in order to benefit from the support of the extremist 
Irish Protestant parties in the parliament and specifically the 
Ulster Unionists Workers Party, granted them many privileges 
including the establishment of a special selection committee in 
parliament. 
  This issue at that time caused independent observers to 
raise 
objections and voice concern over the grave results of this 
political give-and-take and the probable invalidity of the 
present political agreements between England and the Republic of 
Ireland in connection with the future of Northern Ireland. 
  According to observers consider the only probable way for 
creating a stable peace in Northern Ireland is for the British 
Government to stop its discriminative policies against Catholics 
and participate in direct negotiations to be attended by all 
sides involved [sentence as received]. 
  London for various reasons has thus far evaded this issue 
and 
occasionally by bringing up diversions and imaginary claims has 
tried to mislead public opinion in and outside the country 
especially among the powerful Irish community in the United 
States. 
  Last year, too, an independent committee for investigating 
the problem of Northern Ireland named UPSAL had said that any 
peace agreement in relation to Northern Ireland without 
considering the Catholics and Protestants as equals and with 
equal rights for declaring their positions was doomed to fail.

<F P=106> [Interview with Reinhold Schenk, German ambassador to Iran, </F>
by unidentified HAMSHAHRI correspondent in Tehran "on the eve of 
Tehran Mayor Karbaschi's visit to Germany"; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [HAMSHAHRI] Why is it that 
Germany, with its highly developed economy and resources, finds 
it so difficult to accommodate foreign refugees while we have 
sheltered several million and have not encountered any racial 
problems? Does affluent Germany not have our level of economic 
and cultural prowess? 
  [Schenk] There are various beliefs prevailing in Germany. 
One school of thought is that we should forge ahead as a 
multicultural society, and that is why we should accept those 
who are in Germany into our society. We can give them German or 
dual nationality; and steps have been taken in this regard. 
  There are others who believe that we have a long way to go 
to 
a multicultural or multinational society. However our policy is 
to seek a middle course. We have accepted the foreigners who 
have resided in Germany for many years and we have bestowed 
legal rights on them. [passage omitted] 
  [HAMSHAHRI] Has Germany made any effort--as it should--to 
boost cooperation with Iran? 
  [Schenk] Under its First 5-Year Plan, Iran cooperated 
extensively with Germany. I should state that the credit 
envisaged for Iran, and the insurance that had been approved by 
the Hermes Insurance Company is the third highest after Russia 
and Brazil. Iran, where Germany has accepted a guarantee of 14 
billion German marks, is in third place. 
  I believe we do have quite extensive mutual cooperation. At 
present, talks are under way regarding repayments and extending 
the reimbursement period. The main issue in these talks is to 
extend the period for repayment of short-term loans. There are 
no particular problems with regard to the repayment of long-term 
loans. 
  Cultural exchanges are also in progress. For example, the 
third Iran-Germany session on human rights under Islam and the 
West will be held in Iran next spring. Larijani's visit to 
Germany was very successful. He has much credibility as far as 
we are concerned and is an articulate person. He met some old 
acquaintances in the course of his visit, such as Hans 
Dietrich-Genscher, whom he knows very well. Talks were held 
with Larijani on all bilateral issues. In addition, regional 
issues, and matters pertaining to Central Asia, the Persian 
Gulf, and the Arab-Israeli issue were discussed, in addition to 
an extensive range of other issues. 
  [HAMSHAHRI] Regarding the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, 
some people believe that Germany's swift recognition of Croatia 
and Slovenia aggravated civil strife in Yugoslavia. In 
addition, what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not 
concealed from the eyes of the Germans. Has Germany, with its 
80 million people and such a high level of economic potential 
[preceding word in English] performed its human obligations to 
the optimum? 
  [Schenk] The present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not 
just a source of shame for Germany but the whole world. Germany 
has extended humanitarian assistance so far; we are among the 
biggest helpers of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From the legal point of 
view, it is not possible for us to intervene militarily in 
accordance with our Constitution. As far as intervening under 
the NATO aegis is concerned, that depends on the Security 
Council. 
  However, terminating the conflict by military means seems 
almost impossible. That is why we and other Europeans are 
seeking to end the conflict by political means. Some useful 
measures have been taken in this regard. 
  [HAMSHAHRI] Do you have any particular opinion you wish to 
express? 
  [Schenk] I think it is possible to live a comfortable life 
in Iran. Tehran is a progressive city and one can live here 
safely. Foreigners are residing here happily. Tehran is a very 
clean city with far more security than many capitals of the 
world and is teeming with life.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Mohammad Sarafraz: "Obstacles to Cooperation </F>
with Germany"] 
  [Text] There are very clear reasons to broaden relations 
between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Germany. The latter 
does not have a colonialist past and now that it is entering the 
international arena, it is seeking a reliable partner in the 
Middle East. 
  In order to resolve its economic problems, Germany uses its 
own distinctive policy which is not necessarily affiliated to 
U.S. policies. Germany is Iran's top trading partner and has 
assisted in the training of experts in various fields. 
  However, there are some obstacles that, if eliminated, would 
clear the path for better cooperation between the two countries: 
  1. The balance of trade between the two countries is not 
equal, Germany's exports to Iran far exceed Iran's exports to 
Germany. In 1993, Iran experienced problems due to a drop in 
its foreign exchange earnings. Germany's exports fell to 4 
billion marks and Iran's exports were only worth 1.5 billion 
marks. 
  German officials complain of the increase in the volume of 
trade between Iran and the United States in their meetings with 
the Iranian press. Our response is that we have also complained 
about the increase in American exports but one must note that 
the balance of trade between the two countries is to Iran's 
benefit. This means that the sale of Iranian oil to American 
companies is far greater than our imports from American 
companies. If the Germans are complaining about this state of 
affairs, it would be better if they increased their purchases of 
Iranian oil and steered the balance of trade between the two 
countries toward a more equitable level. 
  The Germans contend that the purchase of oil is in the hands 
of private companies and that the government has no control and 
no policy in this regard. If this is merely a propagandistic 
allegation, it is not right to make these remarks regarding such 
a serious matter. If this is true, then is it to be believed 
that European governments do not have any jurisdiction on such 
basic decisions? This matter will be assessed at a later date. 
  2. The German Government has abandoned some of its valid , 
but uncompleted, contracts, such as the Bushehr nuclear power 
plant and its affiliated fertilizer project after 90 percent of 
the work was completed. Germany's reasons for such a breach of 
contract are not acceptable. Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] inspection teams have repeatedly visited Iran and 
endorsed Iran's performance in this regard. Meanwhile the 
Israeli regime has not signed the NPT and has proclaimed that it 
has nuclear weapons but no one dares complain to them. Thus, 
Germany's breach of bilateral contracts will remain a dark spot 
on Iranian-German relations. 
  3. Germany's conduct has not been very just or humanitarian 
in some cases in the Middle East. For example, during the Iraqi 
war against Iran, the Germans supplied chemical weapons to Iraq 
and its experts assisted Iraq in extending the range of its 
missiles, resulting in greater casualties for the Iranian side. 
The Germans did not pay any reparations to Iran, but when 
similar missiles were fired upon occupied Palestine during the 
Iraqi war against Kuwait, the German foreign minister himself 
went to Tel Aviv and paid 200 million marks as reparations. 
Such conduct is unacceptable. 
  In response, the Germans say they were the first European 
country to condemn Iraqi aggression against Iran, and this is 
true, but it does not compensate for Iran's losses in the war. 
  4. The Germans display sensitivity regarding terrorist 
groups but do not pay much attention to the fact that they are 
nurturing an anti-Iranian terrorist group in their midst. In 
1986 Mas'ud Rajavi admitted to the killing of 15,000 Iranians in 
an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. The Germans say that 
their criterion is that they should not commit terrorist actions 
on German soil. This is while the Monafeqin [pejorative term 
for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] recruit members from 
German soil and carry out terroristic operations in Iran through 
the Iraqi government. In addition, Germany is not prepared to 
treat all terrorist groups which are active against European 
governments in the same manner and refuses to grant them asylum. 
  As far as the controversy on human rights is concerned, 
Europeans take the liberty of interfering in the internal 
affairs of other countries except in the case of terrorist 
activity, when they say as long as terrorist actions are not 
committed on their soil, it does not matter. Everyone knows 
that terrorist actions are carried out in that particular 
country. These double-sided policies are not acceptable for the 
broadening of Iranian-German relations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hasan Fathi: "Distancing the Palestinians </F>
from Proximity to Israel"] 
  [Text] It appears that the way is being paved for the 
final compromise in the Middle East; and efforts are being made 
to remove obstacles in the path of peace and tranquillity for 
these regimes. Even though it is too early to venture anything 
on the final compromise among the regional countries, there is 
evidence of conditions being prepared for peace and amity. 
  For many years Egypt and Jordan have moved away from the 
orbit of rivalry and struggle against the Zionists. Lebanon was 
forced to oppose Israel, because of its emulation of Syria and 
the dynamic activities of Hizballah. Beirut will only play the 
tune of opposition to the Zionists for as long as Syria wants it 
to, and the duration of its struggle and the military operations 
of the Islamic Resistance in southern Lebanon will be governed 
by this same logic. 
  Certain steps are being taken by Beirut and Damascus that 
indicate that the way is being paved for normalization of 
conditions in a region which had been uncontrollable and 
unbridled as regards anti-Zionist activities. From time to 
time, it is announced at special junctures that Warren 
Christopher is going to visit the Middle East. At the same 
time, Jordan has banned Hamas' activities and Yitzhaq Rabin has 
assigned two military and foreign policy teams to assess ways 
and means for the withdrawal of the Zionist regime's forces from 
the Golan Heights. 
  Certain events are taking place in Lebanon which are in 
keeping with the developments in Lebanon and Syria. Orders have 
been issued for the arrest and impeachment of 44 Hizballah 
members who staged an armed march on Jerusalem Day, and the Army 
has begun disarming Palestinian groups in the south. 
  The Lebanese foreign minister has openly announced that an 
international plan is being studied under which the Palestinians 
in Lebanon would be relocated to the affluent Arab countries. 
Faris Buwayz told the newspaper AL-SHIRA' that the Palestinians 
in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria would be given permanent residence 
in these countries, but 20 percent of the Palestinians in 
Lebanon would return to Palestine, while the remainder would be 
transferred to the vast and opulent Arab countries. 
  The plan unveiled by the Lebanese foreign minister was, in a 
way, implemented even in 1982, but in those days there was no 
possibility of a compromise and 'Arafat and the PLO had not 
adopted the path of peace and friendship. In that year Israel 
attacked Lebanon on the pretext of crushing the Palestinian 
guerrillas and had advanced up to Beirut. The Zionists embarked 
on a massacre of the Palestinians in the camps of Sabra and 
Shatila and only withdrew on condition that the Palestinian 
guerrillas led by PLO be expelled. It was then that 'Arafat and 
his group of Palestinian guerrillas left Lebanon. 
  The present plan revealed by the Lebanese foreign minister 
is 
aimed at distancing the Palestinians from the borders of 
occupied Palestine. Those Palestinians who reside in Lebanon 
are mainly opposed to 'Arafat and are guerrillas who infiltrate 
into the occupied territories. They carry out suicide missions; 
therefore removing them from the borders of the occupied 
territories is tantamount to closing southern Lebanon's borders 
to the revolutionary Palestinians. 
  The reining in of the Hizballah, the expulsion of the 
Palestinians in southern Lebanon, the ban on Hamas in Jordan, 
the change in the Israeli stance on withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights and, ultimately, Christopher's visit to the region and 
the resumption of the peace talks, are all factors which 
indicate a gradual change in the peace trend. This will be 
complete when Damascus gives the green light to the United 
States and Israel by announcing its acquiescence to the peace 
process. This will sweep out all opposition; and the opponents 
to this process will thus be consigned to the blade of the 
guillotine. [preceding word in English].

<F P=106> [Hasan Fathi commentary: "Northern Iraq, the Center of </F>
Conspiracy"] 
  [Text] Only a few days after the downing of the two UN 
helicopters in northern Iraq, the head of the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK], Jalal Talabani, openly announced his intentions 
to occupy the oil-rich areas of the region and that he is not 
interested in joining the General Assembly of the federal Iraqi 
Government. 
  With regard to the helicopters that were attacked by U.S. 
airplanes, it is said that they were carrying Israeli and 
American experts. At the same time, Turkish military forces 
were entering northern Iraq on the pretext of crushing Turkish 
dissidents who oppose the Ankara regime. 
  Together these developments created conditions conducive to 
depriving Baghdad of its rich northern areas. Even though the 
solidarity and unity of the country is stressed publicly in 
conferences, the current trend seems to contradict such claims. 
  During his visit to France, PUK leader Jalal Talabani met 
with President Mitterrand and other French officials to elicit 
their consent for more extensive activity. All these actions 
are aimed at provoking the Kurds. It is interesting to note 
that most of these actions can be traced to Jalal Talabani. 
  Last year, in collaboration with the Turkish forces, 
Talabani 
attacked Kurdish dissidents' bases, where he killed and captured 
some of them. After this, an Islamic group in northern Iraq was 
attacked by the PUK and broken up. Talabani's extensive links 
with France, the United States, and Turkey are not hidden from 
anyone. 
  It is an irrefutable fact that Israeli experts and Turkish 
military officials are playing an active role in the ranks of 
the PUK peshmergas. They have used pretexts such as mutual 
differences with Baghdad to promote greater closeness between 
Turkey and Israel. However, this has caused even the Kurdish 
people to mistrust their own leaders and the Kurds no longer 
believe their promises and statements. 
  This is because their leaders are only concerned with their 
own personal interests. While the Kurds were being subjected to 
immense pressure and Iraqi Armed Forces were massacring the 
defenseless people with chemical weapons, their leaders had gone 
to Baghdad to meet Saddam Husayn and posed with him for the 
television cameras, mocking their own people. It is because of 
this very subservience of the Kurdish leaders that the years of 
the Kurdish people's struggle have resulted only in destruction 
and suppression. 
  Today when the Iraqi Kurds need assistance and support more 
than ever to surmount their economic problems, internal 
conflicts and ambitions prevent them from attaining their lawful 
rights. The situation in northern Iraq is now more serious than 
ever, because it has become the stomping ground of Zionists, who 
plan to manipulate the regional nations for their own political 
benefit.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified Central News Unit correspondent from </F>
Mashhad on 1 May--recorded] 
  [Text] The director general of the Aliens' Department in 
the Interior Ministry, Hoseyni, spoke to correspondents in 
Mashhad last night and said: On the basis of the new plan, 
nearly 35,000 Iraqi and Afghan citizens--who have received 
refugee status papers from the Islamic Republic of Iran--should 
report to the offices of the Aliens' Department of the Law 
Enforcement forces in the provincial centers to get their new 
refugee documents. 
  Regarding the continuation of the repatriation scheme for 
Afghan refugees in Iran, he said: With the concurrence of the 
Afghan Government and the United Nations, the return of 
approximately 850,000 Afghan refugees has been scheduled. 
  The director general of the Interior Ministry stated: About 
543,000 of these refugees are people who have been given a 
temporary resident permit for six months under the scheme for 
identifying unauthorized refugees in Iran. They have a grace 
period until 2 July this year to remain in Iran. 
  On the legal problems pertaining to those persons who have 
Iranian and Afghan spouses, he clarified that the Government of 
Afghanistan has pledged that it will take the legal rights of 
the Iranian spouses into consideration. He stressed that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's policy is the voluntary and honorable 
return of refugees. As for those refugees who have come to Iran 
from Kabul and Herat and are living in difficult conditions, he 
said: We have announced that we have no restrictions on the 
acceptance of refugees, but we prefer to assist them inside 
Afghanistan's territory. 
  Commenting on the Islamic Republic of Iran's acceptance of a 
new group of refugees from Iraq, he said: In view of the 
pitiful plight of the Shiites in southern Iraq, nearly 7,000 
Iraqi refugees have been housed in camps in Fars, Lorestan, and 
Khuzestan Provinces. 
  The director general of the Interior Ministry said: So far, 
no Azeri refugee is present in Iran and our Red Crescent 
organization is providing assistance to 50,000 Azeris in seven 
camps inside Azerbaijani territory.

  [Text] Mashad, Khorasan Prov., May 1, IRNA -- Some 300,000 
Afghan refugees residing in Iran will return home this year 
under a program worked out by a commission consisting of 
representatives of Iran, Afghanistan and the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
  According to the director general in charge of foreign 
nationals and immigration affairs at the Interior Ministry Ahmad 
Husseini, the repatriation of the refugees is to start from June 
22. 
  Husseini recently visited the Afghan province of Harat along 
with other members of the commission to inspect the status of 
Afghan refugees who have returned home. 
  He told reporters here Saturday that the outcome of a plan 
concerning the repatriation of 850,000 refugees last year and 
their integration into Afghan society was satisfactory. 
  He emphasized that the Afghan refugees who have returned 
home 
have played a key role in the reconstruction of their country 
mainly due to their theoretical and practical skills. 
  In response to the request of the Islamic Government of 
Afghanistan, Iran has issued six month long residence permits 
for some 540,000 refugees who are living in Iran without having 
identification cards, Husseini added. 
  He stressed that during his stay in Harat he announced the 
Interior Ministry's readiness to set up camps inside Afghan 
territory for accomodation of refugees in emergency cases.

  [Text] The goods exported by the Islamic Republic of Iran 
enjoy immense popularity in the markets of southern Azerbaijan, 
according to the press committee official of the Azerbaijani 
city of Lenkoran. He said: The facilities provided to 
Azerbaijan for the importing of Iranian products, their suitable 
prices and quality are among the factors that have enabled 
Iranian products to attract greater attention and have greater 
commercial competitiveness in this region. 
  Tofik Allavardiyev, the press committee official of 
Lenkoran, 
elaborated: The cities of Lenkoran and Astara have become 
wholesale centers for Iranian commodities in Azerbaijan. He 
added: The merchants of the republics of Dagestan and Chechenya 
are among the permanent customers of Iranian products, 
particularly of preserves and plastic materials. 
  An Iranian trader in Lenkoran said: Since Lenkoran is 
considered a bridge for the transportation of Iranian goods to 
various parts of the Caucasus, most of our businessmen display a 
special interest in operating here. He added that the Iranian 
products most in demand include apples, dairy products, 
potatoes, tomato paste, dill pickles, chocolates, machine-made 
carpets, and low-price garments. 
  Allavardiyev said: As soon as the Iranian products arrive, 
long queues of store owners and retailers form outside the 
import companies. 
  One of the merchants resident in Lenkoran, Ali Teymuriyev, 
said: Our proximity to the Islamic Republic of Iran has been of 
immense assistance in eliminating the bottlenecks resulting from 
privatization in the southern regions in Azerbaijan. He added: 
Most of the traders in this region have--with their prompt 
payments--been able to elicit the attention of the Iranian 
businessmen for the purchase of these goods for resale in 
markets in other parts of Azerbaijan and the Caucasus.

<F P=106> [IRNA report from Dushanbe] </F>
  [Text] The Tajikistan radio and television station has 
displayed an increasing interest in pure Iranian music and 
programs in the past few weeks. Radio Dushanbe is carrying more 
than an hour of traditional Iranian music daily. 
  Tajikistan's television has also carried Iranian programs 
such as the "Shakh-e Tuba" [the branch of a tree in Paradise], 
the serial "A'ineh" [mirror], and some Iranian feature films and 
has included Iranian traditional music in its musical 
repertoires. 
  The Iranian programs have been warmly received by the 
Farsi-speaking Tajik television aficionados and audiences, which 
has resulted in more time being allocated to these programs. 
  The presentation of these Iranian programs by the Tajikistan 
radio and television stations has drawn the attention of the 
citizens of this country toward their mother tongue and is 
gradually familiarizing them with certain expressions in Farsi 
that were not in vogue in Tajikistan earlier. 
  In the past year, more than 3,400 minutes of programs 
produced by the Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran have been 
disseminated by Tajikistan television.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, 26 Apr (INA) -- Vice President Taha 
Yasin Ramadan today inaugurated an Arab fair for agricultural 
and irrigation technology and agricultural and food industry. 
The five-day fair is organized by the Iraqi Agricultural 
Engineers Association at the Baghdad International Fair. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan delivered a speech on the occasion. He 
said the contribution of the Arab brothers to this fair 
expresses their siding with their Iraqi brothers who are facing 
a brutal aggression, led by the United States, represented in 
the continuation of the unjust blockade, after the U.S. dreams 
to undermine Iraq through its savage military aggression 
vanished in thin air. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan said the Arab fair for agricultural and 
irrigation technology and food and medicine industry has 
exceptional importance under the current circumstances. It is 
also an important step to thwart colonialist policies that use 
food as a weapon against nations. The participation of Arab and 
foreign companies specialized in all fields of agricultural 
production is a practical method to stand in the face of the 
forces of evil and aggression. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- If the Serbs do not abide 
by their commitments, lasting peace will not return to the 
Balkans, Croatian Premier Nikica Valentic told Majlis speaker 
'Ali Nateq-Nuri here Saturday. Valentic briefed Nateq-Nuri on 
latest developments in the aggressed Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and termed as "good" relations between 
Muslims and Croats. 
  The hojjat ol-eslam said in reply that like the Zionists, 
the 
two main characteristics of the Serbs are genocide and 
expansionism, and they will not be satisfied only with Bosnia. 
  He deplored the inability of international organizations in 
solving the Bosnian crisis and called for lifting of the United 
Nations arms embargo against the republic. 
  On relations between Iran and Croatia, Nateq-Nuri termed as 
"positive" the areas of cooperation and called for full-fledged 
expansion of bilateral ties. 
  Valentic arrived here last night.

forces patrol on al-'Ayshiyah Road in al-Rayhani at 1700 today, 
wounding and killing patrol members. Immediately afterward,

  Elsewhere, a 27-year old citizen, Sonia Musallam, was 
wounded

machine-gun fire from their post in al-Majidiyah as she looked 
after her cattle in Shab'a farms near Halta Town. Soldiers of 
the Norwegian contingent of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon took 
her to Marj 'Uyun Hospital inside the occupied strip.

  [Text] Israeli helicopters raked the outskirts of Zibqin 
and nearby valleys this morning. The outskirts of Habbush came 
under Israeli 82-mm artillery bombardment from Israeli positions 
in Tallat al-Suwayda' at 0500 today. Shells also landed in 
Jabal al-Raf'i and the Nab' al-Tasah basin. Contrary to other 
reports, no shells landed in Yatar but two shells fell 150 
meters away from the village. 
  At 0445 today the resistance men detonated two explosive 
charges on the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Jarmaq Road as an Israeli 12-man 
foot patrol was passing, killing or injuring the entire patrol. 
Two Israeli helicopters immediately evacuated the casualties to 
the occupied land. 
  A joint Israeli-Lahdist foot patrol last night advanced to 
the valleys adjacent to the villages of Kafra and Yatar and 
raked them with machine-gun fire. 
  Between 2100 and 0100 today the Israeli artillery in Tallat 
al- Bayyadah pounded the outskirts of Majdal Zun, Zibqin, Kafra, 
and Yatar. At 2330 the outskirts of Sribbin, Haddatha, and Ayta 
al-Jabal came under an 155-mm artillery barrage from the Israeli 
positions in Tallat Yarin. Shortly after midnight, enemy boats 
fired flares over Majdal Zun and al-Mansuri.

<F P=106> [Report by Bisharah Shirbil: "Contacts Pave the Way for </F>
Serious Dialogue Between the Lebanese State and 'Awn"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Reliable sources have told AL-HAYAH 
that the Lebanese state is moving toward opening a serious 
dialogue with [former Prime Minister and Army Commander] General 
Michel 'Awn with the aim of filling the political vacuum that 
occurred after the arrest of Dr. Samir Ja'ja', commander of the 
now banned Lebanese Forces. 
  They added that "the dialogue is beginning through local and 
international mediators and Damascus is not distant from that." 
  They pointed out that "the end of Ja'ja''s role, the 
detached 
position of the Christians, and the cancellation of Pope John 
Paul II's visit to Lebanon have created the feeling that the 
current situation cannot continue as solutions in the region 
become imminent, and that peace requires internal stability and 
a strong Lebanese authority supported by the broadest sectors of 
Lebanese society." 
  The same sources emphasized that "the meeting which took 
place between 'Awn and former President Shaykh Amin al-Jumayyil 
covered the dialogue issue but there were differences of opinion 
regarding the national conference 'Awn intends to convene in 
Paris in June. Al-Jumayyil is not expected to attend that 
conference, for several reasons." 
  They added that "contacts made by mediators between 'Awn and 
the state have come a long way and the results will be known at 
the earliest possible time barring a surprise that would torpedo 
the entire process." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Was the Sultan's Dagger?"] </F>
  [Text] While people in south Lebanon offer their blood as 
they stand fast against Israeli aggression, the Sultanate of 
Oman hosts a water conference with the participation of a large 
Israeli delegation, as if the sultanate has fought against the 
aggression just so it can discuss normalization today. 
  While Syria leads the steadfastness against aggression and 
occupation and while our people in the West Bank face the 
fiercest kind of persecution and murder, the Gulf Arabs' clear 
treachery is emerging. Qatar wants a gas project with Israel; 
Oman receives an Israeli delegation for a water conference; 
there is another conference in Bahrain tomorrow; and the Gulf 
Arabs' obvious treachery continues. 
  These conferences are nothing but conspiracy itself and a 
stab in the back. They have nothing to do with the Arabs' 
traits, chivalry, and loyalty. They have nothing to do with 
lifting injustice from the oppressed and helping a brother. 
Instead they represent treachery. 
  If Washington believes that through the Sultanate of Oman 
and 
the emirates of Qatar and Bahrain it can achieve normalization 
between the Arabs and Israel and, in turn, encircle steadfast 
Damascus, it is seeking a false peace, seeking to support and 
perpetuate the occupation, and seeking support from nominal Arab 
parties who will collapse at the first encounter. 
  Neither the dagger of the sultan of Oman nor the bondmaids 
of 
the Qatari amir and the mercenaries of the Bahraini amir will 
have any effect on the conflict with Israel. All this is no 
more than a cartoon show that will disappear in the first round 
of the conflict. 
  The conflict is over Syrian land. It is between Syria and 
Israel, between Lebanon and Israel, between Palestine and 
Israel, and between the Syrian people and the Israeli occupier. 
The Gulf Arabs have no right to decide on any measure 
concerning the Syrian- Israeli conflict; rather they should 
provide every support for Damascus, Beirut, and the intifadah, 
because those form a real shield against Israeli ambitions in 
the whole Arab world. 
  Israel wants to devour and divide the Arab world; it wants 
to 
deal with certain parties unilaterally and flirt with others. 
All this is part of an Israeli plan to control the future of 
Syria and the Arab world. 
  Every nationalist and every Arab is today urged to 
contemplate and read the Israeli policy and get to know its 
dangers. There are two ways to do this: First, to defend the 
rights and prevent Israel from enslaving us; or secondly, to 
accept Israeli enslavement. In that case all Arabs will have to 
subject their fate to the Jewish evil which seeks to govern us 
and dominate our future and wealth. 
  If only the Arabs would realize the danger of the Israeli 
serpent sneaking into the best part of their house. Then they 
would chop its head off instead of giving it a warm welcome, as 
is happening in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. 
  We are engaged in a fierce conflict with Israel, which is 
occupying Palestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon. The essence 
of the conflict is the land and until this land is recovered, 
things like this have no description but betrayal. 
  It remains for us to ask: Where was Sultan Qabus' dagger 
during the Arab-Israeli conflict?

<F P=106> ["The Right Angle" column by Nadim Muhsin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Assassinations carried out by states with legal 
institutions are definitely considered criminal actions that 
demand bringing their perpetrators to trial. The mentality that 
plans such assassinations needs to be changed to adapt to the 
modern age. [passage omitted] 
  A state's assassination of its citizens is an indication of 
failure and bankruptcy. Assassinating individuals cannot save a 
country, lift a blockade, repulse an enemy, or restore arms 
programs that are the rights of every state. It is only an 
expression of anger and the loss of nerves, and these are not 
the characteristics of rational states or wise governments. 
  We condemn the assassination of a citizen born in Iraq at 
the 
hands of other citizens. Yes, Iraqi officials made a mistake in 
planning and perpetrating the crime, which constitutes a 
diplomatic problem demanding an extraordinary solution. 
Lebanon's security must be safeguarded against all physical 
liquidations that take place on its territory to enable it to 
prepare the people to confront the Jewish enemy. But why sever 
relations between Lebanon and Iraq? Some time ago we heard from 
the Lebanese Industrialists Association; trade union officials; 
and political, financial, military, and press figures that they 
believe that the only useful, practical response to the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement is the establishment of a 
Lebanese-Syrian-Jordanian-Iraqi common market and 
political-economic-military-cultural coordination. This could 
save our people in Palestine from being swallowed by the Jewish 
state and could be a force that would stand in the face of the 
Jewish Satan and those behind him. 
  Our vital interests, which affect our future and social 
existence in greater Syria, have been undermined and no longer 
have any value because of the blood of one individual. It is 
being said that no individual, no matter how prominent he may 
be, should be more important than society and that his death is 
no reason for killing the future of that society. 
  Will severing its relations with Iraq make Lebanon grow 
stronger and more united, strengthen its economy, and reinforce 
its political and military position or will the establishment of 
Lebanese-Syrian- Jordanian-Iraqi-Palestinian working committees 
that will make plans, not statements, and implement them achieve 
these goals? 
  We are compelled to make a comparison between the Lebanese 
official position toward Iraq and its position toward the Jewish 
state. Lebanon should immediately break off negotiations with 
the Jewish enemy, negotiations that will lead to the 
establishment of diplomatic relations. The Israelis recently 
shelled Sidon and killed some of its citizens. Before that, 
they masterminded the explosion in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
through their agents and were about to rekindle the war in 
Lebanon. They killed our citizens. [passage omitted] 
  Why hasn't Lebanon broken off negotiations with the Jewish 
state, which is responsible for killing tens and even hundreds 
of Lebanese citizens on Lebanese territory since the beginning 
of the capitulation negotiations, but broke off relations with 
Iraq who killed--in the view of the Lebanese state--an Iraqi 
citizen on the same territory? 
  We never knew that the Jewish state was closer to Lebanon 
than Iraq. We never knew that the patience of the Lebanese was 
exhausted toward a brother but not toward the Jews. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 3 May (INA) -- Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, 
secretary general of the Popular Forces Conference [PFC], has 
left Baghdad for Rabat to participate in the meetings of the 
follow-up and coordination committee of the democratic and 
revolutionary dialogue forum, and the seminar on the phenomenon 
of terrorism and violence in the Arab world, due to begin there 
tomorrow, [4 May]. 
  Sa'd Qasim Hammudi noted that the seminar will discuss the 
new world situation, the current Arab situation, human rights, 
and the phenomenon of terrorism and violence throughout history. 
  He said that he has prepared a comprehensive study on 
terrorism and the hegemony the United States is exercising on 
Iraq, the Arab nation, and the world peoples on the pretext of 
the new world order. The study also deals with the comprehensive 
embargo that has been imposed on the Iraqi people for more than

  He added that he will hold meetings and contacts with the 
Arab delegations participating in the seminar and the 
coordination committee meetings, as well as with Moroccan 
popular organizations and parties to explain to them the latest 
developments in Iraq's relationship with the UN Security 
Council, and the importance of mobilizing all pan-Arab resources 
to support Iraq and lift the unjust embargo clamped on its lofty 
people.

<F P=106> [Article by AL-THAWRAH correspondent Sa'ib 'Abd-al-Muhsin] </F>
  [Excerpt] Marking the blessed birthday of the builder of 
great Iraq's glory, leader President Saddam Husayn, may God 
preserve and protect him, Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayr 
inaugurated the first phase of the project to develop the Saddam 
oilfield which was implemented by the technical teams of the 
Northern Oil Company in Salah al-Din Governorate. It is 
considered the biggest gas field in the country. 
  The ceremony began with a recital from the Holy Koran and a 
prayer for the repose of the souls of the righteous martyrs. 
Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad then delivered a speech in 
which he said: I am pleased to be given the opportunity to 
inaugurate this project amid the national celebrations of 
immortal April and the birthday of leader President Saddam 
Husayn, may God protect him. This is considered one of the 
important projects to be carried out by the technical and 
engineering teams of the Northern Oil Company to develop Iraqi 
oilfields. The project involves the development of Saddam 
oilfield, which the responsible foreign contracting company left 
incomplete in August 1990. 
  Dr. Talal 'Ashur Kan'an, director general of the Northern 
Oil 
Company, also delivered a speech in which he said: The project, 
whose first phase we are inaugurating today, is an integral oil 
complex in this area which is far from the company's central 
installations. The complex consists of units for oil 
separation, soft oil treatment, desalination, dehydration, 
treatment, and injection of polluted water, and gas assembly and 
compression. The complex also includes two pipelines: an oil 
pipeline which is linked to the second pumping station on the 
second Iraqi-Turkish pipeline with special adjustments to link 
it to the northern refineries, and a gas pipeline which is 
linked to the northern gas complex. The designing of this 
integral technical complex for the production of crude oil and 
gas takes into consideration the possibility of expanding oil 
operations in this area by including the production activities 
of Hamrin oilfield in the future. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "Intimate, Solid, and </F>
Strong Relationship"] 
  [Text] The relationship we mean is the intimate link 
between the great Iraqi people and their struggler leader Saddam 
Husayn. This relationship, which began 35 years ago, has 
continued to acquire substance and solidity in the cauldron of 
the battles of struggle and reconstruction through all the 
trials until it has, today, become a rare fabric, which no enemy 
can penetrate or undermine. 
  Needless to say, this special relationship has not come out 
of vacuum, nor has it been formed in one battle or occasion. It 
is also, certainly, not a lop-sided relationship such as some 
leaders and rulers have with their peoples, but is an intimate, 
solid, and strong human relationship based on the strong pillars 
of affection, confidence, respect and the truest meanings of 
affiliation and loyalty. 
  The first time Iraqis heard the name Saddam Husayn was in 
1959 when people spoke admirably and appreciatively of the great 
deed by the loyal and courageous Ba'thist youth who, along with 
fellow Ba'thists, liquidated the dictator 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim on 
al-Rashid Street. And, in 1964 Ba'thist strugglers began to 
understand and feel through practical experience that the 
leadership of their young comrade Saddam Husayn was of a 
historic, invasive, and daring type that played a basic role in 
rebuilding the party and unifying it on the organizational and 
intellectual levels, and that it was pursuing the party's 
national and pan-Arab struggle despite all the challenges and 
hardships placed in its way by the renegades. 
  Following the glorious 17-30 July Revolution, Iraqis 
understood that leader President Saddam Husayn, who devoted his 
life to the service of the Iraqi people and the Arab nation and 
the achievement of the historical national and pan-Arab aims and 
ambitions, was in fact the engineer, planner, and brain behind 
all the great achievements and victories the revolution had 
achieved since 1968. 
  It must be said here that the evil enemies have also 
realized 
at an early stage that one of the sources of Iraq's strength is 
this intimate relationship and rare unity between the people and 
their leader. So, it is natural for the evil forces to target 
the symbol and leader of Iraq and his intimate relationship with 
the people by trying hard to drive a wedge between them. 
  At a time when the enemies are wagering and concentrating 
their efforts on penetrating and undermining this unique 
relationship, the glorious Iraqis, who are certain that Saddam 
Husayn is the guarantor of their continuous victories, the 
captain who will sail their ship to safety, and the leader of 
their march on the path of progress and advancement, got even 
more attached to his historic leadership, expressed their 
determination to adhere more and more to the symbol of their 
struggle and dignity, and affirmed their resolve to march 
forward under his flag; the flag of Allahu Akbar. 
  It was also clear during the immortal Mother of Battles that 
the U.S.-NATO coalition was wagering on splitting this humane 
relationship between the people and their leader. The best 
proof of this wager is the U.S. Administration's insistence on 
continuing the unfair blockade on the Iraqi people without any 
legal or political justifications as indicated by the openly 
hostile U.S. acts and statements. But what has happened and is 
happening now clearly shows that the evil forces are discovering 
with time that their wager has failed miserably and that they 
have failed and will continue to fail to undermine this 
relationship which they have been targeting for four years to no 
avail. In fact, the evil forces are now certain that this 
relationship that they are trying to undermine is getting 
stronger and has become one impenetrable unit despite all their 
conspiratorial plans, political and economic pressure, and cheap 
propaganda campaigns. 
  Indeed, this noble relationship has resisted all the mean 
imperialist-Zionist wagers and plans. The evil and aggressive 
forces are convinced that they cannot penetrate it and that what 
they have done and are doing to this end is of no avail and will 
absolutely not change the loyal Iraqi people's stand toward 
their historic leader and righteous son, Saddam Husayn. 
Therefore, the evil forces have no choice but to give up their 
mean endeavor and to seriously reconsider all their hostile 
policies toward steadfast Iraq, which is what they are doing now.

<F P=106> ["Above the Red Line" column by "citizen Mustafa Fahmi </F>
al-Tamimi from al-Khalis, Diyala Governorate:" "Where Do the 
Letters and Parcels of Iraq's Friends Go?"] 
  [Text] Many sincere friends from the Arab homeland and 
other world nations have denounced the unjust blockade which has 
been imposed on our struggling country in all fields, including 
the cultural field. No doubt, they are right in their 
denunciation. But if these sincere ones have denounced the 
position of the Arabs who are colluding with imperialism and 
Zionism, we are astonished about the position that has been 
taken by others in imposing a different kind of blockade on us. 
Do not be amazed, for here are the details. 
  We are members of the al-Khalis Youth Committee of the 
Ambassador League for International Pen Pals, which belongs to 
the General Federation of Iraqi Youths, Diyala branch. Our 
league has succeeded in making a name for itself, pen pals from 
different countries. It has also contributed toward breaking 
through the cultural blockade that has been imposed on us, since 
we have received many letters of solidarity with Iraq, the 
Iraqis, and their beloved leader Saddam Husayn, may God preserve 
and protect him. The letters expressed sentiments of support 
for the just Iraqi stand, thanks to our efforts in explaining 
our position and answering our friends' many questions, which 
revealed the extent of the false Western propaganda to which 
they have been exposed. 
  Unfortunately, however, most of the valuable parcels coming 
from our friends do not reach us, although they have been sent 
by registered mail. At first, we thought that only our league 
faced this problem, then we discovered to our great amazement 
that many other pen pals face the same problem in the country. 
  So, I personally checked with the central post office in 
Baghdad on 12 April. We asked them about the parcels. Their 
answer was: Make sure about registered mail numbers. Yet, most 
of our friends' letters carried registered mail numbers and they 
also are surprised that the parcels did not arrive!! The answer 
was vague. Is it right for these parcels to get lost so easily, 
and who is responsible for this?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Secret Kuwaiti-Iraqi Meeting in </F>
Algeria for First Time Since Gulf War"] 
  [Excerpts] Rabat -- AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI has learned from 
reliable sources that Algeria is making active diplomatic 
efforts to conduct a mediation between Iraq and Kuwait. And 
that a meeting was actually held in Algiers recently between 
Iraqi and Kuwaiti officials for the first time since the Gulf 
war. 
  The sources said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad's visit to Algiers during his Maghreb tour this week 
was not actually made at the invitation of the Algerian Foreign 
Ministry as mentioned in the joint press statement issued at the 
end of the visit. It was made at the Kuwaiti foreign minister's 
request and in response to the Kuwaiti Government's attempt to 
break the isolation imposed on Kuwait since the Gulf war. 
  But Algeria, on receiving the Kuwaiti request, proposed -- 
or, rather, made it a condition -- that Algerian mediation 
should be initiated between Kuwait and Iraq during the Kuwaiti 
foreign minister's visit in return for announcing that the visit 
was made at the Algerian Foreign Ministry's invitation. 
  Kuwait agreed to the Algerian proposal and hence the visit 
took place. The Algerian Foreign Ministry believes the visit 
will achieve success for it with regard to the two countries, 
Iraq and Kuwait. [passage omitted] 
  The sources said that Kuwait's attempts to achieve 
rapprochement with the Arab states that supported Iraq in the 
Gulf war began not so long ago. 
  In this connection Kuwait sent two ministers to Algeria 
before Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmad's visit. These visits 
were not covered by the official media because of Kuwait's 
refusal in the past to receive any Algerian official. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is worth mentioning that the Kuwaiti foreign minister's 
visit took place only two weeks after the visit to Algeria by 
Barzan al-Tikriti, adviser to the Iraqi president, who delivered 
a message to Algerian President Liamine Zeroual from Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  No information was issued about Barzan's visit. His 
activities remained almost secret. Even Iraqi Embassy officials 
in Algiers did not know the reason for Barzan's visit to Algeria 
or its results. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, paid an inspection visit to the al-Thawrah 
camp in 'Imran today. He inspected the forces of the 1st 
Armored Brigade, the 5th Brigade, and the Central Security 
Forces in 'Imran. 
  During the visit, he was acquainted with the results of the 
acts of sabotage and the damage inflicted on the buildings and 
equipment in the camp, which resulted from the regrettable 
incidents that took place in the camp on Wednesday and Thursday. 
These incidents were caused by the secessionist elements in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], as a prelude to implementing their 
scheme to foment fighting between the comrades-in-arms to 
fragment the homeland and to return to the situation as it was 
before 22 May 1990 with the objective of guaranteeing their 
destructive selfish interests. 
  During the visit, the brother president also acquainted 
himself with the conditions of the camp's personnel, and 
congratulated them for their safety. He extended his 
condolences to the martyrs' families, to the masses of our 
people, and Armed Forces on the martyrs of unity and democracy 
from the personnel of the 1st and 3d Armored Brigades who fell 
in these regrettable incidents. He also expressed his deep 
regret and sorrow over the regrettable incidents at the 'Imran 
camp.

  [Excerpts] Aden -- In the first statement by a leading 
Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] official on the serious military 
situation in some Yemeni areas, Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman 
of the YSP Central Committee Secretariat, has told AL-HAYAH that 
there is an "attempt to eliminate the southern military units 
present in northern governorates, beginning with the 5th Brigade 
and the 3rd Tank Brigade in 'Imran. There are continued 
provocations aimed against the other units, especially the 
Basahib Brigade in Dhamar." [passage omitted] 
  He stressed that, "despite the continued attempts to lift 
the 
siege on the southern brigades in the north and the remaining 
units of the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran, these efforts have been 
obstructed by a rejectionist position from the other side and 
the military command belonging to the General People's Congress 
[GPC] led by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman 
of the Presidential Council." [passage omitted] 
  He added: "We hold the GPC leadership fully responsible for 
all the dangers and seditions that may afflict the homeland as a 
result of these actions." 
  The chairman of the YSP Central Committee Secretariat urged 
"political forces and the Dialogue Committee to condemn these 
ugly actions in order to prevent a repetition of the tragedies 
on which this leadership has embarked." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Mu'ayyad; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Mu'ayyad] In your 
opinion, where is the Yemeni crisis heading and how can it be 
brought to an end? 
  [Basindwah] I think certain elements of the party 
responsible for touching off the crisis will insist on 
maintaining it. They could have ended it when they got most of 
their demands. However, perhaps they want to remedy the 
situation, and perhaps they want more. Therefore, I expect the 
crisis to last for a long time, until it turns into an internal 
party dispute. Then, there will be a relaxation. 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] Will this relaxation prevent a military 
explosion? 
  [Basindwah] The crisis could get worse and then abate again. 
Some limited military clashes could also take place. At worst, 
there might be individual assassinations. I can say for sure, 
however, that there will be no civil war or separation. 
Separation means war, and no one wants war in Yemen, unless God 
deprives sane people of their reason. Separation is a crime; 
civil war is a dire catastrophe. 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] It has been argued recently that a federation, 
rather than a merger of unity, is the only way out of the crisis 
and the guarantee to prevent separation. Is this an objective 
view? 
  [Basindwah] With due respect to those who promote this view, 
I think that federation is the first step toward fragmentation 
and disunity. In addition, why do we need federation when we 
are one unified people who share the same origin, religion, and 
language. We do not have ethnic, religious, or native-language 
minorities. Let alone the fact that we have coalesced in one 
melting pot of long struggle, generation after generation, in 
view of our sense of unified national belonging. Yemen is one 
country, not two; one people, not two. The best evidence of the 
unity of land and people is that we used to view the north as 
one part, the south as another. We never regarded them as two 
countries or states, even when each of them was a separate 
state. In addition, why call for a confederation when the 
accord document stipulates that the country should be divided 
into regions, each enjoying local government. 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] Do you expect a new government to be formed to 
implement the accord document and restore order? 
  [Basindwah] This might happen if the crisis continues 
unabated. 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] What about the mediation efforts being made by 
Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE]? 
  [Basindwah] Their good offices are continuing. Ambassador 
Badr Hammam, the assistant foreign minister and envoy of the 
Egyptian president, has continued his meetings in Sanaa and Aden 
since his arrival in Yemen on this his third visit. Perhaps the 
purpose of his visit is to gauge conflicting views and determine 
points of agreement to crystallize a plan for reaching an 
agreement before calling any meeting. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] Has a date been fixed for a meeting between 
the president and the vice president, and when do you expect it? 
  [Basindwah] The reason why the leaders in Cairo and Abu 
Dhabi are in no hurry to invite the president, his deputy, and 
Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, 
is because they want to make sure it will succeed, lest its 
failure should lead to more frustration on the part of the 
Yemeni people and the Arabs. There is no doubt, however, that 
Egypt and the UAE can help us overcome the crisis and heal the 
rift in the relationship between the parties of the ruling 
coalition. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A source in the politburo of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party issued a press statement yesterday, in which it expressed 
regret that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih continues his tragic 
play, after he had announced yesterday the killings of the 3d 
Motorized Brigade and the 1st Motorized Brigade, in front of a 
number of officers and members of the brigade who have been 
detained during the criminal aggression on the 3d Brigade on 27 
April, by using not less than four brigades with various 
weapons. For three days he has been personally leading these 
brutal massacres against the 3d Motorized Brigade, during which 
he refused to listen to the national, Arab and international 
forces demanding a stop to these massacres. After finishing his 
assignment, he came to say that 'Ali Salim al-Bid has been 
making a fuss in the world by contacting the Arab leaders for 
stopping the battle. In his speech the president spoke of the 
millionaires who keep their financial credits in foreign banks 
when wanting not to be opening the door because its odor is 
nasty -- but those who got used to nasty odors lose their sense 
of smell. To refer some of the secret international settlers 
for people to have [words indistinct] the leaders of the 
influential family are among the elite of the richest men in the 
world. The president used unfamiliar language in his speech in 
which he spoke much about Islam, the region, the religion, 
marxism etc. Perhaps this necessitated by the alliance with 
Islam, but [words indistinct] in the speech, but it puts on the 
speaker not his real garment. Then after that he spoke about 
the separatists. We do not know who are the separatists. Are 
they those who went to Sanaa with their children and families 
and the best military equipment and the units they have, 
according to what he said in his speech, or those who were 
entrenched behind their (?fascist) systems to impose their own 
projects, which led the country to this obstructive crisis. The 
planned attack on the 3d Motorized Brigade is the president's 
way of merging the Armed Forces.

  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Praised be God who said: And hold fast, all together, by the 
rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among 
yourselves. God also said: And fear the trial which affecteth 
not in particular only those of you who do wrong [Koranic 
verses]. God's peace and blessings be upon the honest messenger 
and his relatives and companions. Following the military 
developments and ensuing tensions, the House of Representatives 
chairmanship expresses extreme regret over the continued 
developments, deeming them an execution of the wishes of the 
enemies of unity and democracy. Thus, the House chairmanship 
appeals to all the personnel, noncommissioned officers, and 
officers of the Armed and Security Forces--Yemen's great 
(?shield)--throughout all camps and positions in the Republic of 
Yemen to show wisdom and self-restraint and to reject any 
conspiracy calling for infighting. The House chairmanship 
considers this a human, ethical, moral, and national 
responsibility resting with the personnel of the Armed and 
Security Forces. History will register for them this great 
position, which calls for maintaining souls, property, and, most 
importantly, the Yemeni unity--the crowning achievement of their 
determined struggle. 
  The House chairmanship holds the brother chairman of the 
Presidential Council and members of the Presidential Council 
fully responsible for the bloodshed, destruction, and threats to 
unity. We beseech God to guide our steps along the right path.

  [Text] A military spokesman in Aden today accused northern 
armored forces of encircling a southern brigade and of taking up 
fighting positions in an area adjacent to the southern 1st 
Brigade in Yarim. 
  The southern Yemeni spokesman warned of the consequences of 
involving the country in a destructive civil war, particularly 
after last week's clashes between southern and northern military 
units in the 'Imran area which left more than 200 soldiers 
killed or wounded and caused heavy losses of equipment.

  [Text] Sanaa, 3 May (INA) -- A Yemeni Interior Ministry 
source today revealed the parties behind the criminal 
assassination attempt on the life of Hasan Muhammad Makki, the 
Yemeni first deputy prime minister, last Thursday. 
  In a statement tonight, the source said that preliminary 
investigations conducted by the competent authorities have 
proven the involvement of Shaykh Naji 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shayif, 
who is member of the General Committee, which is the highest 
leadership at the General People's Congress [GPC], in the 
assassination attempt in which eight of his loyalists took part. 
  The source pointed out that the Yemeni authorities have 
failed to arrest Shaykh Naji al-Shayif because he and his 
loyalists fled the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Monday.

  [Text] Following the sinful attempt on the life of brother 
struggler Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, first deputy prime minister, 
in which he was severely wounded and his chauffeur, Ahmad Saghir 
Abu-Bakr, and his companions First Lieutenant Salih 'Abdallah 
Ghayban and Lt. Ahmad Muhammad al-Ahdam were martyred, after 
having put up an heroic resistance and having hit a number of 
the assailants, the Interior Ministry officials chased the 
attackers, who fled to the home of Shaykh Naji 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Shayif, who, in turn, handed over five persons to the 
ministry as the perpetrators. However, upon questioning these 
five, it emerged that the real assailants were still at Shaykh 
al-Shayif's, who, it turned out was harboring them. 
  Accordingly, the Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant 
for Shaykh al-Shayif as the suspected instigator of the crime 
and for harboring its perpetrators. Other arrest warrants were 
issued against the perpetrators. 
  Eight suspects are now in custody. The investigation 
revealed that the shaykh is also harboring other suspects. 
Instead of heeding the orders issued by the Interior Ministry 
and turning himself in as mandated by law, he barricaded himself 
in his home, along with a large number of his friends. At dawn 
on Monday, he managed to sneak out of the capital, along with a 
number of the suspects. 
  The Interior Ministry condemns this reckless behavior, and 
holds Shaykh al-Shayif responsible for incitement to commit this 
hideous crime and for harboring its perpetrators. They have to 
present themselves to the law enforcement authorities so justice 
can take its course. The ministry will take all the security 
and legal measures required to bring the accused to justice.

  [Text] A responsible source in the Defense Ministry has 
stated the following: A dangerous development in the miltiary 
incidents being directed by the ruling family in Sanaa has 
occurred. A number of Republican Guard, Central Security Force, 
tank, and armored vehicle units have taken up positions around 
the 1st Artilley Brigade in Yarim. The brigade's position 
became dangerous around 1200 today, when crowds [as heard] 
successively bore down on them. The Defense Ministry has briefed 
local, Arab, and international public opinion on the acts being 
carried out by the military command in Sanaa, and it places full 
responsibility on these rulers, whose appetite has been whetted 
by in-fighting among the sons of the homeland, the waste of 
their blood, and the resulting grave consequences. These events 
place the country on the brink of a devastating civil war that 
will destroy everything.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Defense Ministry and General Staff </F>
Command spokesman; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Even as the homeland was still recovering from the 
bloody wounds of the regrettable 'Imran tragedy, which was 
caused by the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party leadership as part of its criminal scheme to 
fragment the homeland, and instead of learning a lesson from 
that tragic incident in which the homeland lost some of its best 
army personnel and was the biggest loser, that gang continued to 
escalate the military situation, fabricating and inflaming 
tension in the homeland without the least sense of 
responsibility or remorse. It is currently issuing orders to 
move and mass forces in the direction of the old border areas. 
  Yesterday, 3 May, it moved the 'Abbas, (Tasyir), and Milhim 
Brigades toward the former border areas in the Shabwah axis. 
This is a new link in the chain of escalation and tension which 
reveals the aggressive ambitions of this criminal gang and its 
hostile stand toward the Yemeni people and Yemeni unity. It 
barricaded itself behind these military units over which it 
practices its hegemony, turning them into a sword brandished 
against Yemeni unity. It did so after obstructing all sincere 
efforts to merge the Armed Forces and rebuild them on national 
and scientific bases, prevent party affiliations within their 
ranks, and keep them away from party and regional influences and 
political conflicts. It refused to apply the law banning party 
membership in the Armed Forces, considering these forces a 
national institution and the property of all the people as well 
as a shield that protects the homeland and its unity. It sought 
to sabotage the institutionalized and disciplinary structure of 
the Armed Forces through a series of unpatriotic and 
irresponsible acts. It enlisted into the Armed Forces 
party-affiliated groups who had nothing to do with the military. 
They were given grants, rank, and promotions in a haphazard and 
illegal manner and were instigated and wrongly indoctrinated to 
split national ranks. 
  The source added: Today, we call on the heroes of the 
valiant 
Armed Forces in the units over which the party maintains a tight 
grip and in whose ranks the party exercises the process 
deception, charlatanism, and forgery, to express their national 
and responsible stand in favor of the people, homeland, unity, 
and constitutional legitimacy. Exposed are the worn-out, 
aggressive, and criminal gang and its diabolical scheme through 
which this secessionist group seeks to implicate the comrades in 
arms and companions of duty and struggle in bloody and 
destructive fratricide. They did this not in defense of the 
homeland, its sovereignty, security, and stability or to 
safeguard its democratic system and gains or the accomplishments 
of the September and October revolutions, which were watered 
with the blood of martyrs and sacrifices of strugglers and the 
people's sweat and hard work, but to maintain the seats of 
power, the parochial interests, and selfish and destructive 
whims. 
  Therefore, they are beating the drums of war and pushing 
the heroes of the Armed Forces to fight. They are doing so when 
the blood of the martyrs of our people and Armed Forces in 
Abyan, Shabwah, Dhamar, and 'Imran is not yet cold. 
  The valiant fighters of those military units, who are pushed 
by the renegade and separatist gang of the Socialist Party to 
instigate infighting to destroy the homeland and fragment its 
unity, will live up to their national responsibility and natural 
position. They will be in the right trench alongside unity to 
defend it and the homeland and to ward off the advocates of 
separation and wars. They will stand against that separatist 
gang which seeks to dismantle the homeland and takes money in 
payment for the souls of the innocent martyrs. 
  Out of a sense of responsibility and sacred duty, in 
appreciation of the sacrifices of the martyrs, and in order to 
spare the homeland the inferno of death and destruction, we call 
on those brave heroes to reject all orders issued by that 
oppressive gang that defies the homeland, constitutional 
legitimacy, and the people's genuine morals and values. That 
gang views the homeland only through its narrow interests. It 
deals with the people only through its adventurous ambitions and 
crazy desire to oppress the people through the tools of death 
and destruction of everything beautiful in this beloved homeland. 
  May God, the people, and the public opinion be witness that 
we have warned against the gravity of those reckless 
stupidities. We appeal to the rational ones in the command of 
the Socialist Party to responsibly assess the situation, resort 
to reason, heed the calls of peace, brotherhood, and love, to 
maintain the security and stability of the homeland and 
citizens, and not to be dragged into the fabricated lies which 
seek to trigger new bloodshed and tragedies for the public.

  [Text] The House of Representatives met today under its 
speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
  At the outset of the meeting, the people's representatives 
reviewed and approved the minutes of the previous session. 
  The people's representatives then resumed their discussions, 
deliberations, and comments on the contents of the report of the 
House of Representatives' committee which is composed of the 
defense and security committee and a number of representatives, 
concerning the incidents which took place between the 3d and the 
1st Armored Brigades in the 'Imran region. 
  The report was submitted for discussion by the 
representatives, who stressed that the House of Representatives 
should make a decision to stop the military repercussions, 
especially since these repercussions only claim the lives of the 
sons of the one homeland, leave widows, bereaved women, and 
orphans, and cause immense and grave material losses. 
  Several representatives also called on the House of 
Representatives to make a decision to stop media reactions, 
particularly the exchange of media vituperations carried on 
channels 1 and 2. 
  Some people's representatives suggested that the House of 
Representatives form a parliamentary salvation government from 
among the House of Representatives, which is elected by the 
people. This government should be entrusted with the 
implementation of the accord document in letter and spirit and 
should remain unbiased, so that the country will not be exposed 
to fragmentation and splits, and in order to safeguard Yemen, 
its achievements, unity, democracy, security, and stability. 
  In their discussion, the representatives stressed the need 
for the military commanders to respect the Islamic months during 
which fighting is forbidden [words indistinct] so that will mark 
the beginning of the road to entrenching security and stability, 
ending the military repercussions of the crisis, and bolstering 
national unity. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam Khalid Karman, minister of legal and House 
of Representatives affairs attended the meeting. 
  The House of Representatives will resume its meetings on 4 
May, God willing.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified "official source" in Sanaa on 2 </F>
May] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Every now and then and all of a sudden, the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] political and media lies and deception machine 
produces false and deluding statements fraught with falsehoods, 
rancor, and obscenities. These statements are issued in the 
name of the YSP Political Bureau, its information center, or its 
illusionary Defense Ministry. The latest of these statements 
was disseminated yesterday by a Political Bureau spokesman 
through the official news media, which the YSP has turned into a 
deceptive stronghold to promote secessionist feelings and 
justify the use of aggressive means even if it drowns the 
national, Arab, and world public opinion with daily lies, 
fabrications, and falsehoods. All these actions denote a grudge 
against everything in our country; a relinquishment of all 
national and moral values and constitutional and legal 
principles; a blatant disavowal of the two accomplishments of 
unity and democracy; a deliberate vindictiveness with all means 
against the cause of responsible freedom; a growing hostility to 
and derision of the people's powers and the state institutions 
and agencies, particularly the House of Representatives, the 
Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and the military 
and security establishment. This is done for reasons known to 
the bloody and domineering secessionist elements in the YSP, who 
are still suffering from (?thirst) for absolute power, the 
dictatorship of a single party, and a deceitful grudge against 
all those who are assuming national responsibility in any 
position, even if they were from within the YSP leadership 
itself, unless they are the ones in power and unless all 
strategic joints of power are in their hand and not others 
whoever they may be and regardless of the people's will and the 
results of the real elections. 
  This fact was also confirmed by the treacherous acts against 
themselves throughout the past historical stages of which we 
remind the people without needing to explain in detail. These 
acts consecrated their personal interests and their pragmatic 
political creed because any position occupied by any of them in 
the party is above all positions of official responsibility 
within the state. They consider the party to be above all powers 
and that no voice should rise above that of the party, even if 
it is the voice of the people through the ballot boxes and the 
exercise of democracy by all bodies. This is the secret behind 
the Political Bureau members' strife over government portfolios 
and over their distribution in a regional spirit which [words 
indistinct] any of them. 
  They thus ignore the fact that the Yemeni homeland, since 
the dawn of Yemen's unity on 22 May, 1990, has ascended to a new 
historic era and new civilisation where power rests only with 
the people. It is the people who can decide the fate of the 
homeland, now that they, once and for all, buried the state of 
division, toppled the one-party dictatorship, banished from 
their life and land the venomous ideas, and committed themselves 
to the option of democracy and political party pluralism in a 
free society and a unitary democratic state whose constitutional 
institutions are the property of the people. This is because 
such a society is the result of a free will and responsible 
human action as it manifested itself in a lofty reality and 
civilized achievement on 27 April, 1993 when the Yemeni homeland 
launched a new march to pursue building its modern and 
developing life under a popular consensus. The new march has 
shown all the Yemeni people to be able to move with the times 
and to fulfill the requirements of sustained great struggle for 
political, economic, and cultural progress on the road and 
pride, equality, justice, dignity, virtue, and morality. From 
the beginning, these principles were opposed by the people who 
harbored hatred for unity, democracy, and the building of the 
institutions of the unitary state. They used all forms of 
circuitous and veiled sabotage and job distribution by a 
diabolical exploitation of freedom, tolerance, dialogue, and 
openness until their scheming against unity and democracy was 
exposed. All their plans of disinformation were exposed during 
the crisis -- a crisis that was fabricated skillfully and that 
peaked in the rebellion against constitutional legitimacy 
including an infringement of military [word indistinct] with an 
eye to attaining two aims: Rebellion against the authorities of 
the unity state, or secession in order to return to the 
one-party dictatorship in the six governorates that knew 
bitterness and torment before 22 May, 1990. Toward that end, the 
elements that had control over the party blocked the enactment 
of uniform legislation and the unification of the state 
institutions. They also impeded the integration of the Armed 
Forces into one national institution and the disengagement of 
the officers, noncommissioned officers and ordinary ranks from 
loyalty to the party. These elements reacted to all national, 
sincere calls by condemning and disrupting all efforts aimed at 
unifying the Armed Forces through procrastination and outright 
rejection. We would ask these: How does your feigned [word 
indistinct] to an integration of the Armed Forces square with 
your demolition of these forces, with your party plunging the 
Armed Forces into bloody fighting and massing forces along old 
border lines in order to trigger warfare among the sons of the 
homeland? Where are do the military personnel rightly belong? 
Should they be part of advancing decent life and sharing in 
shouldering responsibility or in the graves scattered at the 
approaches of every village? They thus confirm that the party's 
rejection of all efforts to integrate the Armed Forces is aimed 
at affording it the opportunity to retain control over certain 
units as a means of advancing the aforementioned goals if 
political action does not succeed or if the rioting, 
assassinations, and sabotage, and other means fail -- actions 
that are backed up by a brazenly hostile information policy that 
peaked toward the end of the provisional period. 
  This policy exacerbated and became more frenzied when those 
secessionist elements who hold sway over the media and official 
institutions in the economic and trade capital of Aden took 
charge last December. These elements allowed official media to 
become involved in the quagmire of the crisis as an advanced 
instrument for deception, for casting doubts about all national 
values and principles, and for fragmenting national unity. One 
of the ugly aspects of this policy manifested itself through the 
repeated announcement banning citizens from entering their 
economic and trade capital of Aden [words indistinct] the good 
militant Yemeni people in statements issued by the highest 
echelons in the party [words indistinct] in addition to harming 
all the national leaders and symbols. The party has become 
addicted to this condition even when it unabashedly deals with 
its own leaders. The same applies to fabricating accusations, 
concocting justifications, and issuing directives to the 
commands of the units which they control to have them fight 
their brothers as part of a dark and treacherous chain in the 
crisis. Unfortunately, such a thing recently took place in 
'Imran among the comrades in arms and represented a momentous 
national loss for the people and the national military 
establishment. This fact denotes the intentions to continue the 
heated confrontation the secessionist clique holding sway within 
the YSP command had wanted, planned for, and is implementing as 
a means to attain the secessionist objectives and to implement 
the plan of fragmenting the Yemeni homeland as defined by the 
hatred of their masters and by their own designs. However, 
these schemes will utterly fail as did the previous ones thanks 
to the alertness of the people and all their sons in the Armed 
Forces and the Public Security and thanks to the wisdom of their 
political leadership and the confrontation of the unionist 
forces of what is now endangering the people's lives and harming 
their eternal unity. 
  All this targets the Yemeni people's free and united state. 
The people realize that those who harbor rancor against them 
and against the authorities will not hesitate to carry out any 
form of treacherous aggression. The Yemeni people strongly 
believe that when they established a new Yemen through freedom 
and democracy that enhances the march of the homeland of 
freedom, dignity, loftiness, and equality, there will be no 
individual in this homeland who will regret the era of 
oppression, darkness, repression and blood baths, whether those 
represented by the repressive Imamate era, [words indistinct] 
colonialism, or class and regional hatred. 
  It does not befit our lofty Yemeni people to go back to the 
eras of the bloodbaths which one of the YSP leaders referred to 
in a joking manner but which made him lose his life. [Words 
indistinct] clarifies that the YSP Political Bureau is made up 
of a group of people who destroy one another. If this is the 
case, what happens when they deal with the oppressed citizens? 
In spite of this, we strongly believe that no force or person 
in Yemen can trample democracy and constitutional legitimacy as 
it is now more sacred and loftier than [word indistinct] 
henchmen of the party dictatorship, and those who advocate the 
return to the totalitarian or secessionist rule. 
  We say to those that the accord document is being distorted 
by false philosophical statements and the entire people began to 
sympathize with the values and ambitions which the document 
contained [words indistinct] who each day create objectionable 
reasons to prevent progress through the state's constitutional 
bodies and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee toward 
implementing the accord document. We also say that those who 
are showing off their intelligence in [word indistinct] 
national awareness and are inventing analysis at the level of 
political speeches and words despite their spirit and clarity 
enjoy lying to all the people who listened to the speech which 
brother comrade 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council, delivered at the 70 Square during the 
anniversary of democracy day on 27 April when their bad 
intentions made them imagine that his speech included a 
declaration of war on everyone in the same way that they 
understood the slogan of unity or death in the speech which he 
delivered in front of a large crowd of citizens in Ta'izz 
Governorate when he visited it last January. 
  As for being subservient to outside forces, events 
throughout 
history have confirmed this, whether it was to the despotic 
regime or those preceding or coming after it. It is as if the 
YSP cannot exist without being subservient to some master. 
  In conclusion, our people have a firm and unshakable faith 
that unity and democracy will triumph on the Yemeni soil because 
the great hopes to start a new life by overcoming all obstacles 
and challenges is a reality that cannot be canceled or denied. 
Moreover, understanding the crisis and all its bad aspects 
permitted a breakthrough so that prospects would open again for 
the marvels of work and generosity and for championing the will 
of goodness and construction. Therefore, we caution the good 
and unionist brothers in the YSP to quickly save the party from 
this destructive clique. Authority is not something pampered but 
is the right of the people who approve and develop it with their 
free democratic will. Unity is not a game that ends as soon as 
it starts. It is a sacred historical and cultural value and a 
historical accomplishment that champions the eternal presence of 
people and their land as a history and immortal fate in the past 
and present. 
  Moreover, the pillars of the Yemeni homeland are not as soft 
as those rash secessionists imagine. The innocent members of 
the YSP have had enough bitterness in their lives and hearts 
because of the conspiracy, and they should be saved from the 
humiliation resulting from the stands of the domineering 
secessionist elements toward the people's greatest and most 
serious issues, foremost of which is the issue of unity and 
democracy. Our Yemeni people are well aware of those 
secessionists and are waiting for them.'

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, May 4 (AFP) -- At least 10 people were killed 
and 80 wounded in a brief but intense overnight infantry attack 
by rival factions battling Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, 
frontline and hospital sources said Wednesday. 
  A combined infantry force of Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar and Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam based in and 
around the Old Microrayan housing estate attacked pro-Rabbani 
troops across the Kabul River in an attempt to establish a 
foothold there. 
  "The enemy's morale was too weak to sustain an infantry 
attack so they used their heavy weapons," frontline commander 
Sabor of the defending pro-Rabbani troops told AFP. 
  Speaking from his base in the new Microrayan housing estate 
facing the Uzbek opposition dug-in no more than 100 metres 
across the Kabul River, Sabor said three of his men were wounded 
while he had received a report that at least 10 of the attacking 
force had been killed. 
  The 30-minute exchange of small-arms fire was the most 
intense witnessed by locals for several weeks. Even to the rear 
of the combat zone in Wazir Akbar Khan residential area, 
incoming rounds smacked against houses like rain-drops on a tin 
roof. 
  Pro-Rabbani troops based in the apartments of the new 
Microrayan housing estate have converted what were once bedrooms 
and sitting-rooms to frontline bunkers with firing slits 
protected by massive walls of sandbags. 
  Even so, from the heights of the Uzbek-occupied Maranjan 
Hill 
behind Old Microrayan, direct hits by Dostam's heavy artillery 
gunners have broken up the steel-reinforced concrete walls of 
these four-storey apartment blocks like they were lumps of dry 
cake. 
  On Wednesday, delegates said to be representing 15 peace 
organizations met at the Intercontinental Hotel and proposed a 
unified draft aimed at ending the factional fighting in 
Afghanistan. 
  In 11 articles which rehash previously tried and failed 
proposals, the Unified Draft of the Afghan Joint Reconciliative 
Assembly calls for a ceasefire and the convening of a national 
Grand Assembly to elect a parliament and new Afghan leader. 
  While considerable thought has been given to the mechanics 
of 
selecting delegates to the National Assembly, the establishment 
of a ceasefire -- a necessary prerequisite for an election -- is 
mentioned only in passing. 
  The prospects of immediate peace in Kabul can only be 
advanced by a sincere reconciliation between the two main 
rivals, Rabbani and Hekmatyar, who until now have refused to 
come to terms with each other, observers said.

  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said 
that the government and the opposition have to play an important 
role by cooperating with each other to solve national problems 
and to promote democratic values. He was talking to reporters 
after presiding over a convocation of Jamia Khuddamuddin in 
Lahore this afternoon. The president stressed the need for a 
national consensus on important matters like Kashmir and nuclear 
issue. He expressed regret over the violent incidents in 
Karachi and asked people not to let the matter exceed the limit. 
He asked Muhajir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain to prevent 
his workers from being involved in violence and emphasized that 
peace is very essential to create integrity among various 
sections of the people. The president said that Karachi is a 
home of Muhajirs, Balochs, Sindhis, Pashtuns, and Punjabis. He 
urged all sections of the society to pursue the principles of 
peace, integrity, love, and brotherliness. Earlier, addressing 
the convocation function, the president asked people to seek 
guidance from the holy Koran. He regretted that the country, 
acquired in the name of Islam, is lagging behind in the 
education of science and technology.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze </F>
Khan, chief of the Pakistan Air Force, by unidentified 
correspondents at the Air Headquarters in Chaklala; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [JANG] The F-16 planes have become a part of our 
people's psychology. Pictures of these aircraft can even be 
seen pasted on rickshaws and pushcarts. Is it true that our Air 
Force will become weak if we do not get the F-16's? 
  [Khan] The people themselves have raised the bogey of the F- 
16's, and certain circles have tried to spread the word that if 
the F-16's are not received it would be a disaster. The truth 
is that if the F-16's are delivered, it will be good; if they 
are not, we can acquire alternative planes without any problem. 
  [JANG] We have been hearing about the alternative planes for 
a long time now. Much has been said about the Mirage 2000, 
Su-27, and MiG-29, but no agreement has been finalized for 
alternative aircraft. Why? 
  [Khan] We should not make any hasty decisions regarding the 
F-16's. In any case, if we do not receive the F-16's we have 
other options. We can acquire planes from France or Russia, but 
there must not be public debate on the acquisition of the 
alternative planes. The government has thus far not imposed any 
decision on us about the purchase of the new aircraft. The 
government never told us which plane to buy and which one not 
to. Air Force experts are analyzing every aspect of our 
requirements and selecting the new aircraft. This is not a 
decision that can be made in one day. We have to select an 
alternative plane that can be used for at least 20-25 years. 
  [JANG] Has any progress been made on the purchasing the 
Mirage 2000-5 planes? 
  [Khan] The Mirage 2000-5 has just rolled out of the factory. 
It still has to progress from infancy to adulthood. If we 
conclude an agreement today to purchase the Mirage 2000-5 
planes, we will not be able to receive these aircraft for three 
to four years. Therefore, I am examining the possibility of 
buying planes that can be delivered and inducted into our Air 
Force immediately. 
  [JANG] The U.S. signal is very clear that we will have to 
choose either the nuclear program or the F-16's. What are the 
prospects for acquiring the F-16's given this situation? 
  [Khan] We all agree with the government's stand on this 
issue. In our view, the nuclear program and the F-16's are two 
different issues and cannot be linked. There should be separate 
discussions on these two separate issues. We have already made 
it crystal clear that the nuclear program cannot be sacrificed 
for the F-16's. We cannot give what we are being asked to in 
return for the F-16's; that is why I had stated that I do not 
see the F-16 question being resolved soon, and perhaps not even 
this year. The PAF's [Pakistan Air Force] stand is that the 
F-16's are good, but we can get by without them. The PAF is not 
dependent on them. 
  [JANG] Would you please say something about the threats 
facing our country's defense? What are the threats and what 
preparations have been made to counter them? 
  [Khan] None of us wants war. War breaks out when diplomacy 
fails. Currently, by the grace of God, our diplomacy is proving 
very successful, but our threat perception has increased because 
of the Kashmir situation. If a war is imposed on us against our 
wishes, we are confident we have the full capability to defend 
the motherland's airspace. We will demonstrate our full 
professional capability in the event of aggression. 
  [JANG] But certain elements try to scare us with the large 
number of planes India has. 
  [Khan] We will not play the numbers game. It will not be a 
numbers game, because our professional training is very 
realistic. If India commits an aggression, it will have to beat 
a retreat under all circumstances. 
  The air defense of the Kahuta plant is in strong hands. We 
have the appropriate means to counter those who may cast an evil 
eye on the Kahuta plant's airspace. Had security around Kahuta 
not been appropriate, it would have already been attacked by 
now. The fact that nobody had succeeded in advancing toward 
Kahuta proves that it is not only the air defense that is 
strong; due attention is also being paid to Kahuta's ground 
defenses. 
  [JANG] Certain circles have alleged in the media that 
commissions are demanded while purchasing new planes. To what 
extent are these allegations true? 
  [Khan] The Air Force's work is to select the plane. Our 
experts only advise which planes will be suitable for the PAF. 
The Air Force only gives its opinion at the technical stage. 
Those who know how planes are purchased could never think of 
such baseless things. 
  [JANG] How has the vacuum created by the expiration of the 
lease on the U.S. T-37 trainer aircraft been filled? 
  [Khan] We have readjusted our training requirements. We have 
also signed an agreement with China for the K-8 aircraft.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Buying New Submarines for the Navy"] </F>
  [Text] The Pakistan Navy's annual naval exercises, 
"Shamshir (?Bahr-e-Awwal)," have begun in the Arabian Sea. 
Spread over two phases, the exercises involve Pakistan Navy 
destroyers, submarines, missile carriers, oil and supply 
vessels, military aircraft, helicopters, and ground units. 
Following the first phase, exercises will be held in the open 
sea. 
  These types of exercises are essential in assessing the 
performance of the armed forces during peacetime, especially in 
a situation where the future intentions of our neighbor India -- 
which has embarked on aggression against Pakistan twice in the 
past -- do not seem that good. India is persistently pursuing a 
naval buildup. Not only is the Indian Navy several times bigger 
than the Pakistan Navy, it also possess a nuclear submarine 
force. India dreams of becoming a regional superpower. 
Therefore, the Pakistan Navy needs to be equipped with more 
powerful and modern weapons so we will not have to hope for the 
arrival of any fleet in the Indian Ocean, as we did during the 
1971 war. 
  Chinese, Swedish, and French offers for the sale of three 
new 
submarines are now under consideration by the Pakistani 
Government, but the Defense Ministry has yet to make any 
decision on them. A delegation of Swedish military authorities 
is currently visiting Pakistan along with a naval ship. The 
delegation will brief Pakistan Navy authorities on the new 
Swedish T-96 submarines. The Swedish offer includes full 
funding and complete transfer of technology. France also wants 
to transfer technology. Its submarines also possess destructive 
power. China is a friendly country, but it does not have modern 
technology. It is hoped that the Defense Ministry will keep 
national interests in view and make a decision, so that the goal 
of equipping the Navy with the most modern weapons and equipment 
can be achieved in the shortest possible time. 
  The military buildup currently being pursued by India is 
definitely a matter of concern for Pakistan and other small 
countries in the region. Poverty in India is more intense than 
in Pakistan. Its population, already 10 times bigger than that 
of Pakistan, is growing rapidly. What is strange is that 
instead of taking steps to alleviate the suffering and poverty 
of its masses, the Indian leadership is spending more money on 
military preparations. In fact, the Indian leaders consider 
themselves the successors to British rule. Not only do they 
want to establish their hegemony in this region, they want to 
maintain it by increasing their weaponry and military might. 
  Pakistan is undoubtedly a developing country. Its people are 
backward; therefore more funds need to be spent on their 
economic development. It is a fact, however, that Pakistan 
spends comparatively less on defense than India. Pakistan 
cannot disregard its defense. India's aggressive seizure of 
Kashmir and its atrocities against unarmed Kashmiris pose a 
great danger to peace in South Asia. 
  The big powers should realize the threat posed by India's 
increasing military might and the danger the countries of the 
region are facing, including Pakistan. The Indian threat to 
peace in South Asia is always increasing. 
  Given India's already formidable military power and its 
ever-increasing additions to it, Pakistan cannot curtail its 
defense budget. India's military strength is a permanent threat 
to Pakistan's security and defense. 
  The Pakistan Government has justifiably decided to increase 
its defense budget, matching the increase in India's defense 
budget and buildup. In this context, the government has also 
decided to curtail governmental expenditures. Authorities say 
that taxes and revenues amounting to 180 billion rupees will be 
collected before the budget so as to reduce the budget deficit. 
The government has also directed that few taxes be imposed in 
the budget. It is hoped that the government's steps will yield 
gratifying results.

  [Text] Nepal has called for a peaceful resolution to the 
Kashmir issue. The call was made by Nepalese Law Minister 
Maheswor Prasad Singh while speaking to newsmen in Islamabad 
before his departure for Karachi this morning. He said Nepal 
wants the resolution of all issues, including Kashmir, in 
accordance with the spirit of the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation. This is the reason his country is making 
efforts to politically resolve the refugee problem with Bhutan. 
He said his country wants to promote ties with Pakistan in all 
sectors, including trade. The delegation was seen off by Law, 
Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Syed Iqbal Haider.

  [Text] Sindh Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah has said 
that the government is committed to eliminating all sorts of 
terrorism and violence from the country's politics and to bring 
about normalcy in the province. In a broadcast over the radio 
and television a short while ago, he referred to the violence 
carried out in Karachi and Hyderabad which is masterminded by of 
the Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM] and said that it exposed their 
nefarious designs. They want to see Pakistan economically weak. 
The chief minister said that these people, at the behest of 
their foreign masters, want to divide not only Sindh but the 
country, too. The Sindh chief minister said that the MQM 
extremists are demanding the withdrawal of cases against its 
chief Altaf Hussain which had been filed by their allies 
themselves during the rule of the previous government. He asked 
why Altaf Hussain should fear facing the court and demand the 
withdrawal of the cases. He said that these elements through 
their violent activities are harming their own brethren and 
damaging national properties. The chief minister said that 
although there is no substitute to precious human lives, 
however, the government will pay compensation to families of 
those killed in these incidents. Similarly, he told the people 
whose vehicles were burned during the incident to submit their 
applications.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "French and U.S. Contacts With </F>
Algerian Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] Paris, Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable Islamic sources 
have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that high-level contacts have been 
made between an Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leader abroad and 
both the French Government and the U.S. State Department. The 
sources described these contacts as "important," especially in 
view of the "deadlock" in the dialogue efforts between Algerian 
authorities and the FIS leadership detained in Algeria, which 
began on the eve of Major General Liamine Zeroual's assumption 
of the presidency. 
  The sources said that in their contacts with the FIS leader 
the French offered a plan to sponsor a dialogue between the FIS 
and the Algerian Government. However, the sources declined to 
reveal details of the plan. They pointed out that the Americans 
just stressed their neutrality and said they would not offer any 
aid to the present authorities in Algeria. 
  The sources said that these contacts came up against the 
principle of referring to the leaders in Blida prison, as FIS 
leaders do not decide on any radical plan before referring it to 
FIS leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who are detained in 
Blida military prison with two FIS shura council members. 
  The FIS has in the past announced its acceptance of the 
principle of negotiating -- not holding a dialogue -- with the 
ruling authorities. It set conditions for that, most 
importantly releasing FIS leaders and the other detainees, 
closing the concentration camps [al-muhtashadat] in the desert, 
resuming the electoral process, revoking the decision to disband 
the FIS, and judging "those who caused the bloodshed and staged 
the January 1992 coup," which led to the cancellation of the 
elections and disbandment of the FIS, which had won the first 
round of elections. 
  The sources, which asked to remain anonymous, said that the 
"judgment" question was at the top of the French and U.S. 
interlocutors' priorities. The sources added that the FIS 
continues to insist on this point. And that "the best it can 
offer is to turn a blind eye to their departure from Algeria 
before the FIS assumes power." The sources interpreted the 
raising by the French and Americans of the question of "judging 
the officials" as an attempt to explore the FIS' position 
vis-a-vis the possibility of its agreeing to participate in 
power with some of the regime's elements. 
  But the FIS -- according to the same sources -- cannot "join 
hands with some elements whom it holds responsible for what has 
happened in Algeria over the past two years. However, it has no 
objection to dealing with the Army after removing the extremist 
elements from it under a national plan designed to restore 
stability and constitutional legitimacy to the country." 
  In Algiers, AL-HAYAH has learned that President Liamine 
Zeroual has presided over a meeting of the supreme command of 
the Army's General Staff. It is the first meeting of such 
importance held three [as published] days before the 8 May 
marches being staged in support of the dialogue. 
  No information has emerged about the topics discussed at the 
meeting. However, well-informed sources do not rule out that 
the meeting may have discussed the stage ahead with regard to 
the security, political, and economic aspects. They say it is 
likely to be "a meeting for assessing national dialogue" and 
discussing the changes expected in the coming weeks. Three [as 
published] days before the marches staged in support of the 
dialogue, incidents of violence and subversion have begun to 
emerge once again. More than 25 security and Army elements were 
assassinated in one day, the day before yesterday. These 
operations took place after a period of noticeable calm, as 
security forces had seized the initiative and showed they were 
in control of the security situation. 
  Observers interpret the resumption of the "show actions" 
which occurred in the capital and other areas as "a message of 
warning to the regime and public opinion to the effect that 
those whose issue this is, are still on the field." 
  Other sources say that these operations "are merely a 
reaction to the security forces' recent air bombardment of the 
Bouznika [as transliterated] area in Batna (east Algeria) and 
the killing of many members of the armed groups in Boumerdas 
(east of the capital)." 
  But corroborated information conveyed to AL-HAYAH says that 
the "calm" that has dominated the recent period is nothing but 
"an undeclared agreement" on a truce between the regime and the 
armed groups to show "good intentions" vis-a-vis the dialogue 
and national reconciliation.

  [Text] Athens, May 3, IRNA -- The German Interior Ministry 
has threatend to expel the official spokesman of Algeria's 
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Europe, Rabeh Kabir, from the 
country if he issues any press statements or even gives 
telephone interviews, a source close to Kabir told IRNA Tuesday. 
  Kabir was given political asylum in Germany in February by 
the asylum authorities but the Interior Ministry has challenged 
the decision and the matter is in court now. 
  "Rabeh Kabir has to renew his stay permit every week or two. 
We fear that he may be expelled from Germany," said the source 
speaking to IRNA by phone from Germany. 
  "We are the representavites of the Algerian people but we 
are 
not allowed to speak. Where is the freedom of press and 
freeedom of opinion which they proclaim in Europe?" he asked. 
The source requested anonymity. 
  German authorities had held Kabir in custody for three 
months 
last year, but he was set free after a court rejected an 
extradition request by the Algerian regime.

  [Text] The release of the 2,500 prisoners slated to return 
home by Sunday, as stipulated in the Cairo agreement, began at 
midday today. Our correspondents Nisim Qeynan and Moti Amir 
report that seven buses carrying freed prisoners left the 
Qezi'ot detention facility and headed for the Gaza Strip, but 
were stopped at the Nahal 'Oz checkpoint. Meanwhile, a large 
crowd of relatives was waiting for the returning prisoners on 
the other side of the checkpoint. The hold-up is believed to 
have been caused by the delay in the Cairo ceremony. The buses 
with released prisoners were eventually permitted to drive on. 
  It has been learned that all the released prisoners are 
affiliated with Fatah, with the exception of two Islamic Jihad 
and two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] members who signed a 
statement of support for the Declaration of Principles, and that 
about 1,000 prisoners will be released by the end of the day. 
  In Gaza city and in refugee camps in the Strip, the 
returning 
locals are being received with festive processions. In Jericho, 
local inhabitants decorated the police station with flowers and 
palm branches and hoisted a PLO flag. The city has been 
declared a closed military zone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Beilin by </F>
Alberto Stabile in Jerusalem; date not given: "Israel and PLO 
Sign" -- first three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- The historic agreement to introduce 
Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will at last be signed 
in Cairo tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
  Now that an Israeli-PLO agreement can be taken for granted, 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher has been concerned over the 
past two days with the negotiations between Israel and Syria -- 
perhaps the most difficult in the peace process -- in an attempt 
to shift the two antagonists, Rabin and al-'Asad, from the 
stances to which they have clung stubbornly for months. And he 
seems to have succeeded. Irrespective of the official comments 
and the needling, negotiations between Israel and Syria have 
entered a new, "more substantive," phase, as the secretary of 
state put it. Sunday [1 May] Christopher conveyed to Damascus 
the proposal for an agreement put forward by Rabin -- a 
withdrawal from Golan in three stages, the immediate return of 
three of the five Druze villages, security measures, and the 
immediate opening of diplomatic missions. The official response 
was a refusal. "Syria is opposed to an Israeli withdrawal in 
stages," al-'Asad's spokesman said. And Foreign Minister 
al-Shar' went further by describing the Israeli offer as 
"stupid." In fact al-'Asad entrusted Christopher with his 
counterproposal, which includes a number of "substantive" 
points. The "al-'Asad Plan" has been received with "great 
interest" by Foreign Minister Peres, according to whom, "the 
efforts to achieve peace between Israel and Syria are in 
earnest." 
  "I think that our proposals mark the start of a new phase in 
negotiations with Syria," Yossi Beilin said in his office at the 
Foreign Ministry. Of Israel's young politicians, he has had, 
and still has, the most important role in the complex 
negotiations of the peace process, partly thanks to his 
proximity to Shim'on Peres. [passage omitted] 
  [Stabile] Mr. Beilin, tomorrow the agreement on Gaza and 
Jericho will be signed. What will happen after that? 
  [Beilin] We have several different alternatives. We hoped 
that the Palestinians would complete their election process in 
July so as to establish their Council and immediately start 
discussing the extension of autonomy to the whole of the West 
Bank. But if, as it seems, there are no elections in July, and 
more time is needed, then we will negotiate the transfer of 
powers only in some fields -- health, education, welfare, and so 
forth. Be that as it may, from Wednesday [4 May] we will start 
counting the five years of the transition phase. And we will be 
able to start right away to negotiate a permanent solution, 
without necessarily awaiting the end of the second year. 
  [Stabile] Do you not think that you are moving rather too 
fast? The Palestinians do not seem to be at all ready to take 
over power in Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Beilin] I have read some newspaper accounts in this regard. 
I suggest that we should not be paternalistic and tell them what 
they should do. They are at a delicate stage in their history. 
They have to create all their institutions from scratch. We 
must understand them and be patient, as long as our security and 
our interests are not placed in jeopardy. I hope that the PLO 
and the Palestinian police are capable of preventing terrorism. 
This will be the real test of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Stabile] What do you expect? 
  [Beilin] If terrorism becomes less intense, it will be the 
agreement's greatest success. 
  [Stabile] Otherwise? 
  [Beilin] Otherwise we will be forced to reconsider 
everything. 
  [Stabile] Chief of Staff Barak has said that Hamas and the 
PLO have the same final objectives. Do you think that it is 
possible that Israel could some day conduct a dialogue with 
Hamas? 
  [Beilin] We must not exclude anyone a priori. If they are 
prepared to recognize Israel, of course we will not exclude them 
merely because they call themselves "Hamas." I would point out 
that for many years the PLO was our worst enemy. But once they 
changed their minds and put an end to terrorism, we were willing 
to talk. I am sure that their dreams are the same. But I am 
interested not in what they dream at night, but in what they do 
during the day. And as things stand, there are major differences 
between Hamas and the PLO. 
  [Stabile] How would you regard an involvement by Hamas in 
the Palestinian elections? 
  [Beilin] If Hamas renounces terrorism and takes part in the 
elections, we will not oppose it. On the contrary, we would 
regard it as a positive sign, because it would mean that they 
have accepted the peace process. But unless it abandons 
terrorism, we cannot tolerate Hamas' involvement in the election 
campaign. 
  [Stabile] Are you not afraid of the settlers' reaction to 
the 
agreement? 
  [Beilin] I do not think that this opposition will jeopardize 
the country's stability. Few political leaders now could argue 
that we should remain in Gaza. On the contrary, there are 
thousands of Israeli mothers who will be happy that we are 
leaving. 
  [Stabile] Will the opposition be sharper in the case of 
Golan? 
  [Beilin] Golan is important to security. And I think that 
when there are negotiations and a draft agreement with Syria, we 
must make the relinquishment of Golan the subject of a 
referendum. Of course, we could lose it, but that is a risk we 
must face. 
  [Stabile] But are you not afraid that Syria's President al- 
'Asad could regard a referendum on Golan as an excuse for 
avoiding a withdrawal? 
  [Beilin] I think that al-'Asad can understand that the 
decision to make a future agreement the subject of a referendum 
is the most important indication of the seriousness of our 
intentions. Also I can assure you that such an agreement would 
by no means have an easier life in the Knesset, since we have 
only a small majority. 
  [Stabile] Meanwhile al-'Asad has rejected your plan. Will 
you change anything in it? 
  [Beilin] I do not think that Syria will reject all our 
proposals. If they did so, they would be proving to the world 
that they are not in earnest in their desire for peace. We have 
never said: These are our ideas; take them or leave them. That 
is merely a proposal, but it is the most serious proposal that 
Israel has ever made. And if there are differences to be 
bridged, we are prepared to discuss them.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi </F>
Beilin by Mikha Friedman; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Friedman] Mr. Beilin, when 
the process began, it was said that Gaza and Jericho First is an 
experiment and that if it does not succeed, the situation is 
reversible and it is possible to return to the status quo ante. 
Is it correct to say that over the past few weeks, people have 
stopped talking about the reversible nature of the agreement? 
  [Beilin] By its very nature, this is an interim and 
reversible agreement. Naturally, we all hope it will not be 
necessary to reverse it, because it is clear that even if this 
is theoretically possible, it will be extremely difficult in 
practice to come out and say now -- after all that has 
transpired -- that we are revoking the agreement. I believe it 
will be possible to do so only if extremely grave, intolerable 
incidents occur. As is the case with any other agreement, our 
working assumption is that both sides will abide by the 
agreement. It is obvious -- even if not always explicitly 
written down -- that if one side violates the agreement, the 
other side is no longer bound by it. Any agreement of this 
nature is reversible, but the sides always hope it will not be 
necessary to revoke it. 
  [Friedman] What if the worst-case scenario happens? Will 
the wd?nd we have enough leverage to do what we consider 
necessary. 
  [Friedman] What is the difference between the situation that 
will unfold in the territories as of noon tomorrow and between 
future Palestinian sovereignty over all the territories? 
  [Beilin] The difference is in terms of foreign affairs and 
defense. Just like most autonomies in the world, in this case, 
too, there is independence, excluding the two key elements of 
foreign affairs and defense. This is more or less what we gave 
the Palestinians, which is the nature of autonomy. 
  [Friedman] Where will it lead eventually? Do you see an 
inevitable historical process toward a Palestinian state? 
  [Beilin] I do not believe in historical determinism. I 
completely reject the thesis that there is an inevitable process 
leading to a state. A Palestinian state will be established 
only if the Palestinians demand this and there is an Israeli 
Government ready to accept this demand. So far, no Israeli 
Government has accepted such a demand. If you want my opinion, 
I believe that eventually a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation 
will be established, because most of the sides involved prefer 
this solution or are at least ready to accept such a solution. 
This will be the common denominator among all the sides. 
  [Friedman] Let me phrase the question differently: Would 
you agree to be a member of a government that is ready to grant 
the Palestinians an independent state? 
  [Beilin] Look, I must tell you that I do not consider a 
Palestinian state -- which my party and the government of which 
it is the main constituent opposes -- to be a national disaster. 
At the same time, I have always preferred the confederation 
model. If I had to choose between the two options, I would 
always prefer the confederation solution.

  [Text] The leaders of the opposition have submitted a draft 
bill to disband the Knesset and to hold new elections. The 
argument attached to the motion states that the prime minister 
has been grossly violating specific commitments he made on the 
eve of the elections to the 13th Knesset. According to the 
opposition, a minority government, whose performance has been 
gradually deteriorating, cannot possibly stay in office and 
endanger Israel's security. Consequently, the leaders of the 
opposition argue, the 13th Knesset must disband so that the 
people may have their say in new elections and decide who 
deserves to lead it. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 4 May adds: 
"The Likud says that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has once again 
proven his inability to protect Israel's basic interests. The 
Likud's spokesman says that the man who until a few months ago 
promised a Palestinian tiny spot in the town of Jericho has 
given away more than 60 square km of Palestinian sovereignty in 
the Jordan Valley on a silver platter, and he is not yet done."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: "Photo </F>
Opportunism"] 
  [Excerpts] The Americans would have it coming to them if 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat called off the signing ceremony 
at the last minute and sent Warren Christopher home without 
awarding him a free photo-op posing with success (see the 
handshake at the White House lawn after the Oslo agreement). He 
never lifted even the tip of his finger to merit a photograph of 
the agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, as would 
befit a statesman representing the last world superpower. From 
the moment it entered the White House, the Clinton 
administration kept on the sidelines of the political picture it 
inherited. Secretaries of state have been embarking on shuttle 
trips to the Middle East to consolidate political compromise 
(see Christopher's previous tours). 
  If Christopher returns from the Middle East without any 
achievement on the Syrian-Israeli track this time as well, the 
Clinton Administration will go down in the history of 
international relations as the administration which coined the 
term photo opportunism. On 13 September it earned a photo 
opportunity thanks to its hosting services. Seven months later 
it should be pointed out that the signing ceremony on the 
implementation of the September agreement had also been 
scheduled to be held in Washington. The day after the Hebron 
massacre Clinton invited all the sides to engage in a political 
drive under his auspices. Israel and the PLO chose Cairo and 
Paris instead and formulated yet another agreement without any 
U.S. assistance. 
  In his new book, "Diplomacy," Henry Kissinger offers an 
interesting explanation of this phenomenon. "The United States 
is the only world superpower that can intervene anywhere in the 
world," the former secretary of state writes. "On the other 
hand, its power has become more diffuse and there are fewer 
cases in which military power is relevant. The absence of 
substantive ideological or strategic threats has enabled nations 
to focus their foreign policies on issues affecting their 
national interests." Kissinger predicts that the world order 
will increasingly be based on reconciliation and a balance 
between conflicting national interests. 
  On the face of it, this explanation would seem to perfectly 
fit the new order emerging between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians, which was amply more affected by the lessons of 
the intifadah and the Gulf war than by both the Bush and Clinton 
administrations. [passage omitted] 
  Clinton spends 15 minutes a day on an intelligence briefing, 
another 30 minutes on a morning session with his national 
security advisers, and the rest of the day he devotes to the 
question of health reform, welfare, and fighting crime. He 
answers nagging questions about Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea, and 
the massacre in Rwanda with firm pronouncements which become 
obsolete overnight. A State Department official told me that 
ethnic interest groups -- such as the Irish, the Turks, and 
Blacks (see Haiti) -- have become more prominent because of the 
administration's feebleness. 
  Last month the President was photographed with the Muslim 
and 
Croatian leaders who came to Washington to sign an agreement 
which the Serbians in Gorazde immediately turned into a mockery. 
Last week the administration tried to hitch a ride on the 
democracy celebrations in South Africa. It announced a special 
gift to the new government in Pretoria: the annual aid would be 
increased from $100 to $150 million -- less that the aid Israel 
gets in five days. 
  The peace process in the Middle East has so far provided 
Clinton with a podium free of charge, owing to the fact that it 
does not entail sending military troops there to enforce peace. 
The economic aid to the region has long become a matter of 
routine with the U.S. Congress and public opinion. As far as he 
is concerned, the most important point is that Israel did not 
need U.S. pressure to reach a compromise with the Palestinians. 
Consequently, the Jewish lobby and donors had nothing to carp 
about. 
  The transparent photo opportunism will reach its climax 
tomorrow with Christopher's presence on the podium in Cairo. 
From now on, the Americans will have to work for this honor. 
As Kissinger writes, the Syrians consider the Americans a key 
element to balance their and Israel's interests. Clinton will 
have to soften Congress' attitude toward the Syrian regime and 
attain its approval for sending U.S. troops to the Golan, and 
perhaps even to muster international consent to make Israel a 
member of the atomic club. 
  Clinton has presumably learned from the Geneva summit that 
smiling to the camera is not enough when al-Asad and Rabin are 
in the picture. He may very well be forced to take the plunge 
into the icy waters of a Palestinian state and the future of 
Jerusalem during his first (and last?) term in office .

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Al-Qadhdhafi: We Are Seeking </F>
to Close Lockerbie File Politically Without Abandoning Libya's 
Sovereignty and Laws"] 
  [Text] Tripoli -- Libyan Leader Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi has sent a message to Mrs. Baha' al-Kikhya, wife of 
former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, in which he 
stressed that those behind her husband's disappearance "will not 
get away with their crime." He pointed out that security 
cooperation between Egypt and Libya "will succeed in revealing 
details of this case." Al-Qadhdhafi accused the CIA and its 
agents among the "stray dogs" of kidnapping al-Kihkya "with a 
view to driving a wedge between Egypt and Libya." He expressed 
willingness to look after al-Kikhya's wife and children. 
Al-Qadhdhafi uses the phrase "stray dogs" to refer to those 
opposed to his regime. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi met a delegation of Egyptian journalists the 
day 
before yesterday evening in a bedouin tent among olive and 
almond trees in al-Khadra' area, some 56 km southwest the 
capital, Tripoli. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi criticized during the meeting the current peace 
process in the Middle East. He also stressed that the country 
does not intend to hand over the two Libyan nationals suspected 
of involvement in the blowing up of the PanAm plane over 
Lockerbie. He spoke about the reasons that prompted Libya to 
announce its wish to withdraw from the Arab League. 
  On the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement in Cairo tomorrow, Wednesday, he said 
that "Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is chasing a mirage, 
and the Palestinian people are not just one individual." 
  He said that "the Palestinians negotiating with Israel are 
not the custodians of the cause. The real custodians of the 
cause are Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the stone-throwing children, 
the Palestinian people scattered throughout the world, and the 
10 Palestinian factions rejecting the so-called 
Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles agreement. He 
expressed his belief that 'Arafat's agreement to continue to 
negotiate with Israel is attributable to "Arab positions that 
have annoyed him." 
  He said that recovering Jericho and Gaza "does not mean the 
Palestinian issue has been resolved or that the Palestinian 
people have accepted this agreement." Addressing 'Arafat, he 
wondered: "How can you agree to befriend and embrace the Jews, 
when Palestinian martyrs, including members from Fatah itself, 
are falling in the occupied territories?" 
  He added that "the slogan being raised for the so-called 
peace talks means the Arabs' unconditional surrender to their 
enemy. It means their humiliation, abandonment of their future, 
and harming posterity." 
  He said: "We are not warmongers; we are advocates of peace. 
But what is happening at present is a deception for both the 
Jews and the Arabs. The Jews are deceived in order to get rid 
of them from world states, namely by deporting them to the 
occupied Palestinian territories under the Promised Land slogan. 
As for the Arabs, they are deceived so that they waste time and 
squander their cause (...) The land of promise will become the 
land of death." 
  He urged the Jews to "return to their homelands." He 
welcomed "the return of the Libyan Jews living in Israel to 
their country." He said: "If there is a real desire for peace, 
those in charge of the peace process in the Middle East must 
take South Africa as a model to grant the Palestinian people 
their rights and hold free elections in the occupied Palestinian 
territories under UN supervision. He stressed that such a 
measure would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
  On Libya's continuation in the Arab League, al-Qadhdhafi 
said: "The decision to withdraw [from the Arab League] in 
February was taken to make room for Israel to join the league 
after Libya's withdrawal from it. The decision was taken in 
protest at the positions of some Arab states which have turned 
the league's task into a process of talking about ending the 
economic boycott of Israel and entering into projects with the 
Hebrew state, instead of talking about Arab unity." 
  He added that he and Dr.'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary 
general of the Arab League, had agreed over the telephone to 
delay a decision on Libya's decision to withdraw from the 
league. He stressed that Libya has for the time being abandoned 
the idea of withdrawing from the league. He said: "Libya is 
currently experiencing a period of truce with the Arab states." 
  Al-Qadhdhafi supported the league's proposal concerning 
trying the two Lockerbie case suspects at the International 
Court of Justice in The Hague before Scottish judges and in 
accordance with the rules of Scottish law. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi renewed his country's nonobjection to handing 
over suspects al-Amin Khalifah Fahimah and 'Abd-al-Basit 
al-Miqrahi if the United States and Britain agree to this 
proposal, which has "embarrassed the Western states concerned 
with the crisis with Libya." He pointed out that his country 
will continue its endeavors to close this file through political 
means. "But it does not mean abandoning Libya's sovereignty or 
laws." 
  He stressed that "any western escalation of the crisis will 
be confronted by Libyan steadfastness, no matter how long it 
takes." He praised "Egyptian President Husni Mubarak's efforts 
to solve the Libyan-Western crisis." 
  On his position on the Arab states' compliance with the 
international embargo imposed on Libya, al-Qadhdhafi said that 
"the Arab League has not spared any efforts to help Libya. But 
it has no powers to adopt a resolution to compel the Arab states 
to refuse to apply Security Council resolutions." He said that 
that "the Libyan people are saddened by the Arab planes' boycott 
of Libyan airports." 
  Al-Qadhdhafi said that President Bill Clinton is "a good man 
seeking peace. But his Republican predecessors, Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush, set up traps for him in Somalia, Iraq, and 
Libya to topple him or force him to pursue their line." 
Al-Qadhdhafi warned Clinton of the same fate as that of former 
U.S. President John Kennedy, "who was the victim of a plot 
hatched by intelligence organs and major monopoly companies." 
He described Clinton as "an unaggressive man who opposed the 
Vietnam war. And he represents the Democrats, a grouping for 
the minorities." 
  Al-Qadhdhafi, who, the day before yesterday, held a popular 
rally in Tarhunah, 70 km from the capital, which was attended by 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, urged Syria "not to negotiate with 
Israel over withdrawal from the Golan Heights." He also 
stressed that his country "will not recognize Israel, no matter 
for how long the blockade imposed on it continues." He called 
for "the removal of the Hebrew state from the Arab region."

  [Text] The Israeli prime minister has declared it was high 
time Israel ended its domination over a foreign people and 
reconciled with the Palestinians. In this statement he made 
yesterday before the ruling Labor party, Rabin said: Israel can 
remain an occupying force. However, he added: It is high time 
the Israelis realized the price for this will would be to pay 
with their blood. 
  JANA's political editor commented on this report and said: 
Can we infer from the statement made by the Israeli prime 
minister that he has come to his senses, albeit late, or is it 
merely another verbal maneuvering? We would like to think the 
Israelis, who are strangers in Palestine, have come to their 
senses and they have realized that their presence on a land 
alien to them and against the will of its original inhabitants 
and its real owners will cause their destruction and ruin. 
  Therefore, those who were fetched from Europe, America, and 
other regions must return to their original homelands where they 
will lead a peaceful life and they must leave Palestine to its 
owners. Unless this happens, the Israelis will continue to face 
a devastating danger; and if they want to be safe, they must 
reject the plans of the Christian West, which hates them and 
wants their destruction.

  [Text] The UK newspaper THE INDEPENDENT has reported that 
the relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie accident are 
divided over a documentary film about this accident. This has 
prompted British official circles to intervene to prevent its 
showing, under the pretext that it would influence the course of 
the investigation into the affair. Although the Great 
Jamahiriyah has nothing to do with this film, the British media 
are endeavoring to conceal facts from the British people and 
they pick out what serves Britain's colonial purposes without 
respecting the truth and without showing any desire to let the 
British masses know all the facts. This is the method used by 
the western states to black out the facts of this affair.

  However, the investigating judge could not proceed with the 
interrogation due to the health and psychological condition of 
Dr. Ja'ja'. Judicial sources said that defense lawyer As'ad 
Abu-Ra'd protested against interrogating Dr. Ja'ja' in view of 
his poor health. The investigating judge agreed to postpone the 
interrogation until the health of Dr. Ja'ja' improves. 
  Meanwhile, forensic doctor Subhi Germanus examined Dr. 
Ja'ja' 
yesterday. The report confirms that the health of Dr. Ja'ja' is 
good. A copy of the report will be conveyed to the defense 
lawyer today.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Two Statements to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
Juppe: We Will Not Hand 'Awn Over; 'Awn: I Respect the 
Restraint Decision"] 
  [Text] Paris, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The issue of opening 
Lebanese security and political files has reached France because 
most Lebanese opposition leaders are in Paris. 
  The most complicated issue is that related to the presence 
of 
[former Lebanese Prime Minister] General Michel 'Awn whose 
position there is extraordinary because he is neither a 
political refugee nor an ordinary foreigner residing in France. 
  In the agreement under which 'Awn left Lebanon for 
Marseilles 
and then La Hutte Maison, the French authorities promised to 
receive the Lebanese guest and provide protection for him 
provided he fulfilled a number of conditions. According to a 
high-ranking French source, the most important condition was 
that 'Awn should exercise restraint and not carry out any 
political activity on French soil. 
  It seems that 'Awn has begun to seriously annoy the Lebanese 
Government since he announced preparations for a national 
conference which he invited the opposition to attend in the 
French capital in June. 
  Lebanese official sources have hinted that 'Awn's financial 
file might be reopened and that there is a possibility that a 
request could be made for his extradition. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
if his government had received any such official request. Juppe 
replied "we have heard some echos about this matter but there is 
no official Lebanese request. At any rate, handing 'Awn over is 
out of the question but we will impress upon him the need to 
exercise the utmost restraint." 
  Juppe seized the opportunity to call for a new Lebanese law 
for radio and television media "as soon as possible to enable 
everyone to express himself freely," in fulfillment of the 
promises made by the Lebanese Government to the French 
authorities. The French official also said that he wished that 
"judicial procedures in Lebanon would be carried out legally and 
legitimately, upholding the right of defense." He was referring 
to the file of the recent assassinations and explosions. 
  Meanwhile, in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Gen. 'Awn 
said that he "intends to honor the restraint commitment" and 
would, therefore, refrain from holding any press conferences or 
organizing political demonstrations. He added that he would 
only answer the numerous telephone calls he gets from Lebanon 
and various parts of the world. 
  On the claims that the Lebanese state was trying to open a 
dialogue with him, 'Awn said: "That kind of talk remains a kind 
of informational maneuvering. If there is anything serious, 
those concerned in Lebanon and outside it (Syria) should state 
their position in advance on a number of fundamental 
non-negotiable issues, namely the restoration of full 
sovereignty and freedom and independence of Lebanese 
decisionmaking." 
  'Awn added: "Everything else is negotiable. I am one of 
those who advocate respect for the vital interests of Lebanon's 
neighbors and for realistic dialogue with them, free from any 
complexes." 
  'Awn said that the "attempts of the current authorities in 
Lebanon are part of the policy of intimidation and temptation." 
He revealed that attempts were made in the past to hold a 
dialogue with him but they failed because "the government could 
not provide answers to the questions I asked."

  [Text] Hizballah has stated that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's tour of the region is not designed to 
overcome the obstacles hindering the bilateral negotiations but 
to further divide the Arab ranks. It stressed that Washington 
is only pursuing its traditional policy of fragmenting and 
undermining the Arab position and enhancing the circumstances 
conducive to imposing a settlement according to Zionist 
conditions. 
  Hizballah released a statement yesterday on Christopher's 
tour, saying: Christopher's tour comes at a time when there are 
expectations of a possible relaxation in the negotiating process 
after the complications caused by the massacres that the 
Zionists committed in the occupied territories, notably the 
massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, which left more 
than 60 Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded and maimed. 
  Those who are optimistic about Christopher's tour believe 
that U.S. diplomacy is again focusing on the conflict in the 
region, particularly in view of the approaching date for the 
signing of the limited administrative self-rule agreement 
between the Zionists and 'Arafat. The statement said: 
Washington may consider the signing of the agreement as an 
accomplishment that it has long waited for and that it may pave 
the way for further breakthroughs on the other negotiating 
tracks. 
  It seems obvious, however, that Christopher is not coming to 
the region to help surmount the obstacles hampering the 
negotiations, as reported, but to focus on enhancing the policy 
of dividing the Arab stance. The U.S. secretary of state wants 
to put more pressure on the Gulf countries to abolish all 
boycotting of Israel and, consequently, to demand that they 
exert all possible efforts to pressure Syria to respond to the 
Zionist conditions for a settlement. 
  Regarding Jordan, Christopher will use the lifting of the 
siege of Aqaba port not in return for Jordan's renewed 
participation in the negotiations, as certain people imagine, 
but for signing a bilateral agreement with the Zionist entity. 
  The statement added: Regarding Lebanon, the U.S. conditions 
were set before Christopher's tour of the region. These 
conditions were declared by enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin: 
"Halting and disarming the resistance, assimilating Lahd's 
militiamen, and initiating negotiations leading to security 
arrangements in south Lebanon." The U.S. ambassador in Beirut 
reasserted the same conditions during his recent meetings with 
Lebanese officials. 
  The statement added: Regarding the Palestinian track, the 
Americans show their satisfaction with the approaching date for 
the signing of the self-rule agreement because it reflects Yasir 
'Arafat's acceptance of the maximum Zionist conditions and 
minimum prerequisites for the limited self-rule. 
  Hizballah noted that Washington, which claims to sponsor the 
peace process, is in fact pursuing its traditional policy of 
fragmenting and undermining the Arab position and promoting the 
circumstances conducive to imposing a settlement according to 
the Zionist conditions. We emphasize that Washington fully 
adopts this policy, otherwise where are the U.S. commitments 
that have been declared since the Madrid conference, which were 
reasserted at the Geneva summit? We believe that these 
commitments are only cosmetic to improve the image of the U.S. 
role and conceal its truth and hazards. 
  The statement said: In the past we warned that the fragile 
Arab situation will not enable the Arabs to stand up to the 
U.S.-Zionist onslaught, which at one time seeks to take the 
Arabs unilaterally and at another to pressure the Arabs to 
normalize ties with Israel. This means that the Arab negotiating 
policy has never embodied its own interests or was able to cope 
with this stage of the confrontation. Hence the importance of 
the role that the resistance is playing in south Lebanon and the 
intifadah in the occupied Palestinian territories in confronting 
the policy of penetrating the Arab ranks, taking them 
unilaterally, or exhorting them to normalize ties with Israel, 
and in offsetting Arab defeats. The resistance in the south and 
the intifadah in the occupied territories are making progress to 
offset the astonishing concessions being made by the ilk of 
'Arafat and certain Arab countries, particularly the Gulf 
countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah spiritual leader Muhammad Husayn </F>
Fadlallah by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Text] [Jallul] Are you still the spiritual leader of 
Hizballah? 
  [Fadlallah] Should I apologize for having such a title? 
This title has never had any significance on the organizational 
level. It was given to me by Western intelligence services when 
they found nobody else in the arena. For 40 years now, I have 
been an Islamic activist on a broad level; I have never tied 
myself down to any specific party. In Iraq, I opened up to the 
al-Da'wah Party, while I was not one of them. I also have had 
ties with Hizballah and other parties in the Islamic world. I 
am an active Shiite not in the ideological sense, but in the 
Islamic sense. At the same time, my mind was open to all other 
secular streams. Since the fifties, I have struck up 
friendships with communists, nationalists, and Ba'thists. I 
always talk to them because I do not believe in having a closed 
mind toward anybody else, since everybody who believes in, 
respects, and takes pride in his thinking should respect the 
thinking of others. 
  [Jallul] It seems that the Islamic stream should today 
confront the progress made on the level of establishing the 
state institutions. This means the Islamic stream either 
confronts or accommodates this development. What will this 
stream choose? 
  [Fadlallah] I do not think that any Islamic current can have 
reservations about the establishment of the state, in its broad 
sense, since it is either a state or anarchy. We as Muslims 
think that, as the leaders of the faithful say, the people 
should have a ruler, because a vacuum does not serve anybody and 
because anarchy can contribute more to the disintegration of 
society than a bad government. Therefore, no one can put 
forward the option of having or not having a state. The only 
option is that there should be a state; people can then work 
within this state to oppose its plans and to propose ideas that 
could change its attitudes in the future. The opposition acts 
within the state, and not outside it. We in Lebanon oppose 
security, social, and political disorder. 
  [Jallul] Does this mean you are for a peaceful transfer of 
power and agree to the Constitution and all other pillars of the 
state? 
  [Fadlallah] There is a difference. To feel that there must 
be a state does not mean you believe in all its components. We 
coexist with falsehood, but do not recognize its legitimacy. It 
is similar to anyone who promotes a certain thinking: this 
person believes his thinking is the legitimate authority, in the 
principled sense of legitimacy; however, this person does not 
defy the legitimate authority he finds in his country that 
preserves public order. He might, of course, ask people by 
peaceful means to join his legitimate authority. 
  [Jallul] Do you condone modern activities and appearances in 
your region? 
  [Fadlallah] When you come to the suburb, Ba'labakk, or some 
areas in the south, you will see an unveiled woman walking next 
to a veiled woman. You will also hear one radio carrying all 
sorts of songs, as well as another radio carrying Islamic songs. 
People exercise their freedoms in a very normal way. Since the 
Islamic movement was launched, it has never been reported that a 
woman was beaten because she was not wearing a veil. Also, 
schoolgirls have never been forced to wear a veil. 
  [Jallul] Can the Communist Party hold a political symposium 
near your residence? 
  [Fadlallah] It used to do that. Perhaps, when there was an 
act of sedition, some people had fears in view of the general 
atmosphere so they refrained from any activities. There is no 
such thing as an Islamic republic in the suburbs or Ba'labakk or 
about Islam being enforced, one way or another. 
  [Jallul] But you know that a criminal was executed at your 
party's headquarters, the Islamic way? 
  [Fadlallah] The issue was related to a tribal movement, and 
the area was heading toward sedition, in which blood could have 
been shed indiscriminately. The Islamists did not move to 
arrest or execute the killer, but the people called for the 
implementation of the Islamic law. So, the killer was executed 
with the consent of all the tribes concerned with this issue. 
There was an official silence by various officials who approved 
this without declaring it. The state could not prevent the 
shedding of blood due to the circumstances of the tribal 
community. Moreover, you know that the state has never been 
able to stop tribal acts of revenge except through 
reconciliation and accord. 
  [Jallul] The state says that the media must be organized. Do 
you agree with this? 
  [Fadlallah] The fact is that anyone who has money in Lebanon 
can establish a television station. It is a paradox that those 
who own the illegal television stations, as they say, occupy 
prominent positions in the state. So parties who used to own 
television stations have sold them to those who have money. 
Making money the basis for the establishment of television or 
radio stations regardless of the policy of this or that news 
media could be a serious issue. However, the issue which 
imposes itself in every democratic state, or any state which 
believes in freedoms, if we do not want to use the word 
democracy, is that who determines the seriousness of or the need 
for another news media? Is it the state? 
  [Jallul] Yes, if we accept the state's authority. 
  [Fadlallah] Perhaps, the state is responsible for people's 
security concerning what they hear or read. This could be true 
when the state and its men are trustworthy people. The state 
that used to own television and radio stations did not prevent 
its men from establishing illegal television and radio stations 
at their own expense, why? I wonder if the militias, as they 
say, violate the law, why don't the state men violate the law? 
Why do they have their own news media if the state's news media 
meet the country's need? This means that the state did not 
present a successful media program to the people that meets 
their needs and fulfills their aspirations, and which represents 
the democratic slogan of the state. 
  [Jallul] Are not we supposed to give the state some time, 
especially since less than two years have passed on its plan to 
enforce the law? 
  [Fadlallah] We note that some people have contributed to 
confusing the state by adding news media to the state run media 
and encouraged others to do so. This means that they have not 
strengthened the state's plan, but their own positions. The 
problem is that any president, whether he is number one, two, or 
three works to plant his men in the state institutions in order 
to be a reserve for him in the future to maintain his influence 
after he leaves his post. 
  [Jallul] Have not things always been this way? 
  [Fadlallah] They were not as aggressive as they are now. The 
problem in the past was that the statesmen used to take bribes, 
and the problem these days is that the statesmen bribe other 
people. This is why some people have contributed to corrupting 
the state. The deputy, the minister, the director general, this 
man of religion, that economic position are all taking bribes. 
We heard that no sect or party is allowed to have its own news 
media. So, since you recognize sectarianism and parties and you 
act in your position as a representative of this or that sect, 
then what is the difference between your sectarianism to which 
you resort and from which you derive strength, and that 
sectarianism which exists in a newspaper or a television 
station? If the government includes licensed parties why 
shouldn't these parties be allowed to have their own news media? 
  [Jallul] There is a great deal of fear that the "Islamic 
resistance" seeks to gain domestic weight? 
  [Fadlallah] I can say that the Islamic resistance is a 
movement that confronts Zionism, particularly in Lebanon. This 
resistance is not an exhibitionist or an adventurous movement. 
I can also assert to everyone that the Islamic resistance does 
not have any internal plan in Lebanon unless it, as a community, 
is subjected to mad repression, in which case it is natural for 
the Islamic resistance to defend itself. 
  [Jallul] Why did other currents leave the resistance? 
  [Fadlallah] The problem is that these currents have isolated 
themselves from the scene. I talked to some of them who 
informed me about their economic problems. In the past, they 
used to have financial support, and I believe this support has 
stopped. 
  [Jallul] Do you agree on the decision which dissolved the 
"Lebanese Forces?" 
  [Fadlallah] I do not have any data in this regard. We 
differ with "the forces" whether over their relations with 
Israel or their political proposals. 
  [Jallul] Do you believe that the Syrian-Iranian differences 
over the Middle East issue could have repercussions on the 
Islamic current in Lebanon? 
  [Fadlallah] I believe that Syrian-Iranian relations are 
based on an understanding of the circumstances surrounding 
Syria. The Islamic Republic [of Iran] appreciates these 
circumstances although it rejects the idea. Moreover, there is 
a strategic political situation surrounding the Iranian-Syrian 
relations, so you feel that both countries need one another. 
Thus, I do not imagine that the future relations with Iran 
would deteriorate even if Syria actually achieves reconciliation 
[with Israel]. This is so because there are other very deep 
issues which transcend the differences in political views, 
especially since Iran, which is opposed to reconciliation [with 
Israel], did not wage a fierce war on this issue. 
  [Jallul] You have frequently announced your support for the 
Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria. Do you not fear being 
accused of interfering in Algeria's internal affairs? 
  [Fadlallah] All influential parties are interfering in 
Algeria. I know that the French are interfering strongly, and 
France has a broad current inside the Algerian Government. I 
also know that the United States is interfering effectively, and 
sometimes it may suggest that it is supportive of the Salvation 
Front. There are Arab states which support this or that team. 
Perhaps, Iran is the state that is extending the least support 
in Algeria. Others, however, have an arrogant media policy 
which tries to influence all their moves and schemes. The 
problem in Algeria is that it has turned into a scene for many 
international intelligence services. We are very sad about the 
situation in this country which was a symbol of awareness and 
freedom; we grew up on the heroic deeds of the Algerian 
mujahidin. We feel that the Algerian state is a victim of the 
U.S.-French conflict. As long as the United States is chasing 
France everywhere, and as long as France is trying to maintain 
its positions here and there, each country in the Arab World and 
in the Third World in which there is French influence will 
suffer in one way or another from what Algeria is suffering.
