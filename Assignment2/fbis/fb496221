<F P=106> [Article by Ghani Eirabie: "India's Talks Offer a Ruse"] </F>
  [Text] The wonderful diplomatic art of saying "nothing in 
many words" seems to have been perfected by India in the six 
"non-papers" it has recently sent to Pakistan. They skirt the 
core issues between the two countries, but nonetheless New Delhi 
insists that "non-issues" be discussed at yet another--and 
perhaps equally futile--8th meeting between the two foreign 
secretaries. 
  One is left with the unhappy impression that the proposed 
exercise is designed to have the world believe that India and 
Pakistan are engaged in resolving the dispute on their own and 
so the international community need not concern itself with it. 
Whereas the unfortunate position is that the entire exercise is 
cosmetic, intended to gain time for the 500,000 Indian forces to 
complete their ethnic-cleansing job in Kashmir. 
  This is established by New Delhi's March 21st clarification 
of its January 24 non-paper on Kashmir. The slight hope raised 
by the original vaguely-worded non-paper has been quashed by the 
latest communication declaring categorically that India views 
the state as an integral part of India and it sees no need to 
ascertain the will of the Kashmiris--which amounts to saying the 
core issue is not open to negotiation. This communication also 
exposes the self-serving nature of the non-paper-I's call for an 
agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the 
Line of Control. (But not the whole country.) The new 
formulation tends to detract even from the Simla Agreement by 
talking of the "ultimate solution" instead of the "final status" 
of the state; and the real aim appears to be to convert the Line 
of Control into a bilateral border, which compromises Pakistan's 
traditional position. Oddly enough, India apparently seeks 
Pakistan's help in consolidating its imperial hold on the 
adjoining areas with its proposal for so called mutual 
cooperation in the prevention of any encouragement of any act 
detriment to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious 
relations. 
  India seems to conveniently forget that peace and 
tranquillity along the Line of Control is being jeopardised--in 
fact breached--by India itself. Through its deployment of half 
a million troops equipped with the most lethal weaponry and the 
most callous use of it against unarmed civilians. The havoc 
caused by India's systematic genocide of Kashmiris has been 
documented meticulously by several human rights organisations. 
New Delhi's non-paper-I stresses the need to avoid "military 
exercises" in the vicinity of the Control Line. It forgets that 
Pakistan has never carried out any military exercises on its 
side of the Line; and that for the last four years, it is India 
that has actually been carrying out "live" military operation on 
its side of the Line, resulting in an estimated 100,000 
casualties, including 30,000 killed. 
  If anything, it is Pakistan which should be calling upon 
India to pull out the additional forces it has inducted into the 
state since 1990 and restore the balance of forces between India 
and Pakistan as envisaged in the U.N.- sponsored ceasefire 
agreement of 1949. Pakistan, in fact, could charge India, before 
the UN Security Council, with flagrant breach of this 
international agreement. In any case, India ought to de-induct 
the additional forces to restore the balance and to prove that 
it is sincere in its proposal for peace and tranquillity along 
the Line of Control. 
  Additionally, India should establish its bona fides in this 
regard by agreeing to strengthen the presence of the United 
Nations Military Observers' Group for India and Pakistan 
(UN-MOGIP) to enable it perform its mandatory job of monitoring 
the Control Line, where there has been recurrent shelling and 
air violations. The UN Observers should be enabled to patrol 
the Line on both sides of it; and also authorised to monitor the 
situation further inland on both sides of LOC. Additionally 
full and free access should be provided to UN agencies and 
international human rights organisations to all areas of Jammu 
and Kashmir to check grave human rights violations. 
  On the related issue of Siachin, there is no need for a 
repeat discussion on the principles of a settlement; they were 
all decided at the Defence Secretaries meeting in June 1989 when 
it was agreed that redeployment of troops must take place in 
accordance with the Simla Agreement which requires both sides to 
withdraw their forces to the positions obtaining in 1972. 
India's non-paper-2 seeks to repudiate that commitment and to 
that end, it contends that as agreed in November 1992, the two 
sides shall disengage from "authenticated" positions they are 
presently occupying and fall back to new positions since 
identified by India. Now, the Indian contention happens to be 
completely false; Pakistan never agreed to any authentication of 
currently-held positions; and there is no question of any fresh 
understanding on any fallback positions for the simple reason 
that India is required by the Simla agreement to vacate all 
positions that it was not occupying in 1972 and it certainly had 
no positions in Siachin or anywhere near it. There is no point 
in holding fresh talks to repudiate the earlier ones. 
  Five rounds of Indo-Pakistan talks on demarcation of the Sir 
Creek estuary (subject matter of non-paper-3) have ended in 
complete deadlock; the common-sense answer lies in now referring 
the issue to international arbitration. In the case of the 
Wullar Barrage built by India on river Jhelum in violation of 
the Indus Basin International Treaty, (non-paper-4) technical 
and legal experts have first to thrash out the issue in all its 
bearings before the Foreign Secretaries can usefully apply their 
minds to it. Again, while Pakistan would like even to further 
extend the scope of the Joint Commission by including 
environmental protection, combating natural disasters and 
strengthening SAARC in its purview the prevailing level of 
mutual bitterness between the two countries, especially in the 
context of carnage in Kashmir, makes the present time most 
inappropriate for a meeting. (India's non- paper-5). 
  Likewise, it is the deadly deadlock over the core issue of 
Kashmir which imperils Pakistan's security and consequently 
inhibits any fruitful dialogue on nuclear non-proliferation. On 
principle, Islamabad subscribes fervently to non-proliferation 
and would welcome any agreement intended to insulate population 
centres against any nuclear attack, vide non- paper-6. But we 
are averse to make-believe declarations. We are not convinced 
of the genuineness of the Indian proposal for protection of 
population centres when we find India pulling back its forces 
from its eastern frontier and concentrating them against 
Pakistan's major cities, when we see India so deploying its 
missiles on the border that our major population centres are the 
designed targets, or when we notice India acquiring and arming 
deep-penetration attack aircraft to hit deeper into our 
territory. 
  India's proposal for a "no-first-strike" commitment also 
sounds hollow when India is so determinedly refusing to enter 
into any regional non-proliferation arrangement. For years, 
Pakistan has been offering: simultaneous ratification of NPT, 
simultaneous acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards, mutual 
inspection of each other's nuclear facilities, a bilateral 
nuclear test ban treaty and establishment of a nuclear free zone 
in South Asia. Each one of these proposals has been rejected by 
India. More recently, Pakistan has proposed a conference of 
India. Pakistan, Russia, China and the United States, to evolve 
regional arrangements for nuclear non-proliferation and South 
Asian security; but this too has not been accepted by India. 
  It is India's duplicity and its habit of wriggling out of 
solemn commitments by legalistic sophistry or fancy 
interpretations which make many Pakistanis sceptical about any 
dialogue with India. While CIA has offered US Congress 
irrefutable evidence of India's capability of deploying a 
nuclear arsenal and of even evolving a hydrogen bomb, New Delhi 
still insists on calling its 1974 nuclear bomb a "peaceful 
explosion". While ordering two more squadrons of the latest 
MiG-29's to reinforce its existing lineup of 750 most modern 
warplanes, new Delhi opposes the US release of 38 F-16s to 
Pakistan that it has already paid for on grounds that it will 
upset the balance of power in the subcontinent. While the UN 
Security Council, the US State Department, India's own founding 
fathers (Nehru) and Lord Mountbatten papers all agree on 
describing Kashmir as disputed territory whose future is still 
to be determined by its people, India insists on claiming it as 
an integral part of the Indian Union and dismissing the massive 
popular uprising in Kashmir as no more than "terrorist 
infiltration by a neighbour," and is employing 500,000 fully 
armed soldiers to decimate the Kashmiris much the same way the 
Yugoslav Serbs are ethnic-cleansing the Bosnian Muslims. 
  The conclusion is inescapable: The fake talks on 
"non-issues" that India seeks to hold at the foreign 
secretaries-level are designed to hoodwink the world into 
believing that India is applying its mind to resolving the 
Kashmir crisis, whereas the Indian strategy is to gain an 
uninterrupted opportunity to "end the Kashmir problem by ending 
the Kashmiris. Pakistan must beware of the trap.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "India's nuclear battle-cry"] </F>
  [Text] In total disregard of the need for establishing 
peace in the region and improving the socio-economic conditions 
of the people inhabiting it, Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao 
has once again said that his country would not give up the 
nuclear option "under any circumstances". Speaking in the Rajya 
Sabha, he categorically stated that India will not sign the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) nor will it accept any 
"regional arrangement" on the issue under pressure from any 
quarter. He also reiterated his Government's commitment not to 
cap the missile programme. Referring to the just concluded 
official talks in London with the United States, the Indian 
Prime Minister said that no special significance should be 
attached to them as these would have no impact on the country's 
nuclear policy. 
  Statements emanating from India at the highest level 
indicate 
that it is determined to unleash a nuclear arms race in South 
Asia. At present India operates eight nuclear reactors and has 
atomic research centres all over the country. In addition, six 
more reactors are under construction and another 14 have been 
planned for the next 20 years. There are confirmed reports that 
at the moment India possesses 40 to 60 nuclear warheads. 
Through its Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme 
initiated in 1983, India has developed five missile systems. It 
has successfully tested its intermediate range 
surface-to-surface missile, Agni, which has a range of 2500 
kilometres which would ultimately be increased to 5000 
kilometres. To keep all this hidden from the outside world, 
questions about India's nuclear programme cannot be asked in its 
Parliament under the Nuclear Energy act of 1962. 
  It is only because of the threat posed by its bigger 
neighbour that Pakistan was forced to embark on its own nuclear 
programme. However, in the interest of peace in the region and 
to save it from a nuclear holocaust, Pakistan has offered seven 
different proposals to curb regional proliferation. All of 
these have been rejected by India on the pretext that it 
believes only in global nuclear disarmament. This is only a 
self-serving stance and an excuse for not signing the NPT. In 
an address to the Indian Defence Policy Forum in 1992, former US 
Secretary of Defence, Robert McNamara asserted that "by its 
refusal to accept the NPT, India is isolating itself and is now 
seen as a major barrier to further progress toward reduction of 
the nuclear danger". In January 1993, the Washington Post 
wrote: "There is growing consensus that it makes little sense 
to penalise Pakistan but not India, a far bigger power whose 
indigenous development of both nuclear and ballistic missile 
capacity continues unabated. In her address at the Command and 
Staff College, Quetta the other day, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto highlighted the same point: "The nuclear and missile 
threat to Pakistan is real and immediate. It is, therefore 
unrealistic and illogical to expect Pakistan to take unilateral 
steps. Sanity and reality demands regional nuclear solution". 
It is unfortunate that by pursuing a policy of benign neglect 
towards India's nuclear Programme, the West has complicated the 
region's nuclear tangle. The international community has to play 
its role in this connection and exert pressure on New Delhi to 
see reason and accept the imperative of a regional approach to 
dealing with the nuclear issue -- a potential threat to the 
existence of more than a billion people in the sub continent.

  [Excerpt] Islamabad, May 4 -- "Exploding a nuclear device 
will take the nation out of the present state of dejection and 
bring our friends like China and Iran closer to us". 
  This was stated by an exponent of pan-Islamism, former chief 
of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt Gen (Retd) [retired] 
Hamid Gul while addressing a select gathering of the citizens 
here on Wednesday. The meeting was organised by the Citizens 
Action Committee. 
  The former ISI chief, who played a pivotal role during the 
Afghan Jehad observed that now Pakistan should go nuclear. He 
said this could infuse a new life in the nation, which according 
to him was facing a decadence like situation. He said the 
Pressler Amendment is aimed at cutting off aid to a country 
which is following the nuclear option whereas it is not against 
those nations that have already acquired the nuclear capability. 
  Advocating his case Gen Hamid Gul said by doing so Pakistan 
will stand at par with India when new nominations for the 
nuclear club may take place in 1995. Besides, he said, our best 
friends like China and Iran which consider us fast becoming 
American surrogate will come closer to us. 
  The former ISI chief said a wave of re-awakening had run 
throughout the Islamic world. The secular world was falling 
apart and the secular philosophy, he said, had failed to hold 
the nations together. He said only Islam provided a basis for 
movement and mobilisation with a forward looking philosophy 
while secularism has no future. 
  He said not the governments but the people of the Islamic 
world are coming closer for a common cause. [passage omitted]

today via the Allenby Bridge. Our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports that the officers are slated to take over the local 
police station today. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers in 
the area ordered the soldiers to evacuate the hundreds of 
residents who waited for the policemen in the city square and to 
close the shops in the city. A riot erupted in the area, and IDF 
officers forcefully evacuated correspondents and journalists, 
including a Qol Yisra'el crew. Three officers dragged Qol 
Yisra'el's correspondent for about 20 meters, and shouted and 
threatened him with loaded guns, causing him slight bruises. 
The residents of Jericho started to riot, forcing IDF officers 
to disperse them with rubber bullets.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 May (MENA)--Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah left Cairo this evening for Amman after 
a two-day visit to Cairo during which he met President Husni 
Mubarak. In a predeparture statement he said he conveyed to 
President Mubarak a verbal message from Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih in which he explained the ongoing events in 
Yemen. He said that what is happening in Yemen is a 
confrontation of the remnants of renegades and secessionists, a 
confrontation with the participation of all the people, led by 
their armed forces, which are loyal to constitutional 
legitimacy. He noted that the new Yemeni defense minister who 
took the constitutional oath yesterday hails from the southern 
governorates as does the new naval forces commander. 
  Basindwah said he believed that the situation in Yemen has 
been decided and that what is going on will last no more than a 
day or two at most. He noted that during his meeting with 
President Mubarak he sensed considerable understanding, noting 
that the Yemeni people appreciate President Mubarak's great 
concern for Yemen's security and safety. He noted that he is 
going to Amman to convey a message to King Husayn of Jordan. 
His Jordan trip is part of a tour of Arab countries to convey 
verbal messages from President Salih to Arab leaders.

  [Excerpt] There have been no new developments in the 
government crisis. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is spending 
his fourth day at home in Quraytim today. His visitors report 
that he is persisting with his positions, which call for 
broadening the basis of government representation of Christian 
leaders. The visitors appealed to him to start exercising his 
powers again and to maintain his authority. 
  Within the framework of the efforts to solve this crisis, 
former Prime Minister 'Umar Karami is now meeting with Chamber 
of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri. 
  Delegations continued to arrive at Prime Minister 
al-Hariri's 
house in Quraytim, where he received Labor Minister 'Abdallah 
al-Amin, Minister of State Shahe Barsoumian, and Deputy Khatchig 
Babikian. Earlier, al-Hariri received al-Mina' Mayor 
'Abd-al-Qadir 'Alam-al-Din, who expressed his support for him in 
continuing to shoulder responsibility. He also received a 
delegation from the al-Fulayti clan in 'Irsal, which called on 
al-Hariri to continue shouldering his responsibility. He then 
met a delegation led by Shaykh Khalil al-Mays, the mufti of 
Zahlah and al-Biqa. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Caroline Faraj and P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan and the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) on Tuesday [10 May] began talks seen crucial 
to the fate of the economic agreement they signed in January 
outlining a framework of ties between the Kingdom and the 
Palestine self-rule authority expected to take over the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. 
  Jordanian comments after the five-hour session at the Prime 
Ministry were non-committal, reflecting the Kingdom's quest to 
learn firsthand about the PLO's intentions after the 
organisation signed an economic agreement with Israel in Paris 
last month. 
  The Paris agreement contains many provisions which have 
brought to question many elements in the Jordan-PLO accord 
signed in Amman on Jan. 7. Officials said Monday the Kingdom 
would be seeking clarifications on these points and answers to 
questions on key issues related to banking and monetary affairs, 
trade and customs etc. 
  Sources said the Jordanian delegation to the talks, headed 
by 
Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Information Jawad 
al-'Anani, presented to the PLO side a paper containing the 
points of the clarifications that the Kingdom was seeking. 
  No definite details were available, but the sources 
indicated 
that these questions dealt with the implications of the Paris 
agreement on the Jordan-PLO accord and how the PLO intended to 
go about tackling some of the obvious "contradictions" and 
"overlappings" between the two documents. 
  PLO officials appeared anxious to reaffirm that they were 
not 
seeking to "renegotiate" the Jan. 7 agreement and that the talks 
were aimed at detailing the modalities of implementing the 
accord in terms of mechanisms and guidelines. 
  In general, the Jan. 7 agreement was seen as a general 
framework for Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations without 
going into specifics. However, it was widely assumed then that 
the principles in the accord, as and when implemented, would 
have cemented the relationship. 
  According to the sources, Jordan and the PLO had agreed in 
earlier meetings on economic relations that the specifics could 
not be worked out as long as it was not known how far the 
Israelis were willing to go in giving economic freedom to the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  However, the Paris agreement, which detailed the specifics 
of 
economic relations between Israel and the Palestinian autonomous 
territories, was seen here as severely curtailing the scope of 
Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations. 
  The meeting, which was supposed to have begun early Tuesday, 
did not get off until after the Jordanian Cabinet held its 
regular weekly session during which the Kingdom's strategy in 
the talks with the PLO was expected to be discussed and 
finalised. 
  Speaking after the meeting, Dr. al-'Anani would only say 
that 
"all economic issues of common concern were discussed" during 
the session with the PLO and that the discussions would continue 
on Wednesday. 
  Ahmad Quray', head of the economic department of the PLO, 
who 
led the Palestinian side to the talks, said the meeting was 
"comprehensive and extensive" and covered "all aspects of the 
Jordanian-Palestinian economic relationship." 
  "The Jordanian-Palestinian accord (of Jan. 7) is the basis 
of 
the relationship," he told AL-RA'Y and the JORDAN TIMES. 
  Asked whether the PLO was seeking any changes in the 
agreement in view of the Israel-PLO accord, Mr. Quray' said: 
"Changes if any will be in favour of the Jordanian-Palestinian 
accord." He did not elaborate. 
  However, he stressed, any possible changes in the accord 
"will mean detailing the agreement's provisions. There will be 
no changes in the basis and principles of the agreement." 
  "Certain joint committees will be activated," he added. 
  "We discussed all issues such as banking currency, trade, 
and 
customs," he said. "These are issues that should be clarified 
to sustain the unique, brotherly relation between Jordan and 
Palestine." 
  Asked whether the Israel-PLO accord had narrowed the scope 
for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation, Mr. Quray' said: "On the 
contrary, I believe that the agreement with Israel has helped 
implement the Jordanian-Palestinian accord." 
  "It is true that the (Israel-PLO) accord did not give us all 
that we were seeking, but it gave us some of what we sought," 
said mr. Quray'. 
  "The door is not closed for the rest of our rights, which 
will be restored gradually..." 
  Mr. Quray' said: "We will soon witness Palestinian-Arab 
agreements. We are part of the Arab World and a permanent 
member of the Arab League and we have a strategic Arab depth 
which supports our position." 
  Attending the meetings on the Jordanian side were planning 
Minister Ziyad Fariz, Minister of industry and Trade Rima 
Khalaf, minister of State 'Adil Irshayd, Central Bank of Jordan 
Deputy Governor Michel Martu and Foreign Ministry advisors 
Ibrahim Badran and Ahmad Qatanani. 
  The PLO side to the meeting included Jawad Naji, head of the 
Economic Department of the PLO in Amman, Amin Haddad, 'Atif 
'Alawinah, 'Awn al-Shawwa, Midhat Kan'an, Palestinan Ambassador 
al-Tayyib 'Abd al-Rahim and Samir Hulaylah.

  [Text] Tehran, May 12 (AFP)--The United States recently 
sent a message to Iran on opening direct and formal 
negotiations, a newspaper said Thursday. 
  The written message contained assurances that the United 
States did not seek to undermine the Islamic republic and urged 
Iran "not to take seriously" anti-Tehran comments made by a US 
official during a recent Gulf tour, the daily SALAM said. 
  The assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, 
Robert Pelletreau, said earlier this week in the United Arab 
Emirates that Iran was a potential threat and he renewed US 
pledges to defend the region. 
  Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after 
Iranian radical students stormed US embassy here and took its 
staff hostage. 
  The United States has on several occasion called for direct 
negotiations to improve ties, but the two sides have yet to make 
a breakthrough. 
  The latest message also expressed concern over Russia's 
"future threats" against the region and said Iran was 
geographically "well-placed to counter such an influence," SALAM 
said. 
  But the paper said the message also criticised Iran's 
alleged 
human rights violations and support for international terrorism.

  [Text] Tehran, May 11, IRNA -- The British Government has 
bugged the Iranian Embassy in London in breach of the 
international laws and regulations, President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani disclosed here today. 
  He made the remark during his speech at the end of the 
Iranian press festival, where he said the Iranian staff at the 
embassy could discover the hidden microphones, installed by the 
British MI-6. 
  "The British Government has launched propaganda moves in 
order to overshadow the issues," said the president. 
  Britain has accused Iran of collaboration with the Irish 
Republican Army (IRA), in a bid to prevent a blatant fiasco 
against the British Government. 
  Details of the president speech will be aired later. 
  The president said the British Government made the 
accusation of Tehran's collaboration with IRA after Iran charged 
the British Government with planting a microphone at Iranian 
Embassy in London to spy on the activities of the embassy staff. 
  "In fact the (British) accusation was made almost 
immediately 
after the discovery of the microphone," stressed the president. 
  President Rafsanjani said the British accusations were 
"white 
faced lies" and unfounded for which Britain did not provide any 
evidence. 
  He said the discovery of the microphone could lead to a big 
scandal for London but the British Government launched a 
propaganda ballyhoo in coordination with the British press to 
create a smoke screen and cover up the issue. Hashemi also 
expressed surprise that all dailies and magazines in Britain, 
even the ones on the left, began attacking Iran "in unison", a 
fact that showed the press in Britain was not that independent 
after all. 
  Elsewhere, the president said imperialism has launched a 
conspiracy to undermine the people's morale, and force them to 
believe that they had achieved nothing from the victory of the 
Islamic revolution. 
  He regretted that a few local press follow the imperialist 
press, however, he asked the Iranian press to cover both the 
weak points and strong points. 
  "The press should avoid biased attitudes, and refrain from 
proposing factional issues, but try to fullfil their duties by 
taking into account the national interests," said the president. 
  President Rafsanjani said that he had tried to create a free 
atmosphere for the press, and added that he would never allow a 
writer to come under pressure because of expressing his or her 
ideas. 
  "The total press system in Iran have rendered very good 
services, and I expect them to take a more fair position 
concerning the issues."

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] In an editorial headlined "An Improper Beginning," 
the AL-BA'TH newspaper says: At the beginning of next week 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return to the 
region again after he toured its capitals two weeks ago, but his 
mission of giving a push to the peace process has not achieved 
any results due to the Rabin government's stands which pushed 
the peace talks to a stalemate. 
  The paper adds: What makes things uncomfortable is that Mr. 
Christopher begins his new tour of the region with the statement 
issued by his department on terrorism and the states which 
protect terrorism, in which the name of Syria, along with the 
names of other states, was included. This is not a good and 
appropriate beginning, especially since the U.S. State 
Department's statement is unrealistic and based on many 
fallacies, in addition to the fact that it is hostile and 
provocative. 
  AL-BA'TH says: If this statement is meant to pressure Syria, 
Syria has never yielded and will never yield to pressures from 
any one. 
  The paper adds: We would have hoped and wished that 
Secretary Christopher had not sent this statement as an opening 
message concerning efforts to reactivate the peace process. 
This is because this is an improper message and the address to 
which it was sent is completely wrong. 
  The paper says: Christopher is returning to the region based 
on his statements that he has positive ideas on the 
Syrian-Israeli track. Undoubtedly, everyone who loves just and 
comprehensive peace hopes that Christopher will something in his 
quiver that justifies his optimistic tone, and that the ideas he 
is talking about will be based on U.S. success in persuading the 
intransigent side which is rebelling against the international 
legitimacy; namely Israel, to accept the indispensable bases of 
making progress toward a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper stresses that Christopher will find in Syria every 
concern about a just and comprehensive peace, and sincere 
cooperation to put the peace process on the road leading to this 
peace. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is working 
for peace in the open. It will not accept a humiliating peace. 
Moreover, it will not do anything that would be shameful to 
announce. It is either an honorable and just peace or no peace. 
  Under the headlines "The Basis for Peace," the newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH says: He is mistaken who thinks that Syria would 
accept less than the full restoration of the Golan, in addition 
to occupied southern Lebanon. This is because full withdrawal 
is the basis for a comprehensive peace, and he who is concerned 
about a just and comprehensive peace must also be faithful to 
the pillars and constants of peace which were approved at the 
Madrid Conference. 
  The paper adds: Israel has imagined it can have peace and 
occupation together. Sometimes it slandered Syria's stands, and 
other times Lebanon's stands. It has always sought to entrap 
this or that party in a separate deal, something which was 
achieved in the labyrinths of Oslo which led to the Cairo 
agreement that imposed Israeli trusteeship on the Palestinian 
Arab people and their destinies. 
  The paper adds: Israel cannot present the agreement with the 
Palestinian side as an example of partial solutions which it 
seeks to achieve on the other tracks of negotiations, or use it 
as a pretext to peddle such unilateral deals, and at the same 
time exclude the bases of the peace process and the pillars 
governing the Madrid conference, foremost of which is the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  Proceeding from this important point, President Hafiz 
al-Asad stressed, when he received U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher early this month, the need to tackle the major 
issues of the peace process in order to guarantee making 
progress. Also based on this, Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi 
have called for adhering to the Madrid bases and for further 
coordination among the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks. 
This is in order to foil Israel's attempts to deal separately 
with each Arab side and drag it into partial solutions that have 
nothing to do with the Madrid bases and the essence of a just 
and comprehensive peace, which is based on full withdrawal and 
resolving all aspects of the conflict to guarantee the 
establishment of a peace that would end all factors of tension 
and chaos, and fulfills the international community's desire for 
stability and security in the region. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Peace cannot be established 
without an accurate implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions which Israel seeks to bypass through secret deals 
and partial solutions which entrench occupation and give Israel 
peace and land together, something which is impossible. 
  Under the headline "The Israeli Withdrawal," the newspaper 
TISHRIN says: News agencies cited informed sources as saying 
that the U.S. secretary of state's Middle East tour this time 
will be confined to Syria and Israel, and that it is aimed at 
giving the Syrian-Israeli track a push forward and at achieving 
tangible progress on the road to a just and entrenched peace in 
the region. 
  TISHRIN adds: It is known that Christopher held lengthy 
talks in both occupied Jerusalem and Damascus during the 
previous tour. It is no longer a secret that Syria adhered to 
the principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from the 
Golan as a basic condition for peace. At the same time, Israel 
gave first priority to its security, after which withdrawal will 
follow or will be achieved in phases to test Syria's peace 
intentions, as the Tel Aviv rulers say. 
  The paper adds: Talk about probing Syria's peace intentions 
is a kind of deception and cover for the occupation and its 
expansionist plans, taking into consideration that Syria has 
always complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and the 
UN Charter and principles. Moreover, Syria has never been 
exposed to a single international denunciation. However, Israel 
has been violating the UN Security Council resolutions since 
1947 until now. It has also violated the principles and 
charters of the international community. Based on this, Israel 
is the one which must be put to the test, considering that it is 
the aggressor and the occupier. Testing Israel's desire for 
peace can be represented by its full withdrawal from the Golan 
and all the occupied territories. The Knesset decision on the 
annexation of the Golan will never change this. 
  The paper says: Syria has made several appeals to achieve a 
just and comprehensive peace, the peace of the brave, and called 
on Israel's rulers to be brave and to be up to this peace. 
Until this moment, Syria has not seen any true Israeli 
response. On the contrary, Israel's rulers adopted the policy 
of procrastination, prevarication, and of evading the UN 
Security Council resolutions. They have just made statements on 
a certain withdrawal from the Golan. We want to reiterate that 
Syria rejects any phased settlements or partial solutions. This 
is because true peace hinges on the full restoration of the 
Golan, the dismantling of all settlements, and the return of the 
Syrian evacuees to their land and homes. Consequently, Israel's 
withdrawal does not constitute a concession, for withdrawal is 
dictated by the international law and the UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East depends 
on Israel's compliance with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied 
territories paves the way for a firm and true peace. Without 
this, talk about peace will be a waste of time.

<F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Tayyash: "Shaykh Sa'd Urges Yemenis To </F>
Learn From Wounds of Invasion of Kuwait"] 
  [Text] Kuwait -- Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah al-Salim 
al-Sabah, Kuwaiti heir apparent and prime minister, has urged 
the warring parties in Yemen to "end the fighting, spare the 
nation's blood, and return to dialogue as a means to resolve the 
dispute." 
  In a meeting with a small number of Arab journalists, 
including AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's, in Bayan Palace yesterday, Shaykh 
Sa'd said: What is happening in Yemen saddens every Arab. 
Kuwait will not rejoice to see a northerner taking up arms 
against his brother in the south, or vice versa, despite the 
position Yemen adopted during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, 
namely its failure to condemn the aggression, keeping silent 
about and helping it, and cooperating with the Iraqi regime. 
  He added that "Kuwait will not hesitate to issue a statement 
expressing Kuwait's -- the government's and people's -- 
condemnation of brothers taking up arms against one another." 
He pointed out that Kuwait supports any Gulf or Arab endeavor 
aimed at resolving the dispute. But as a result of Arab 
disunion, all endeavors have become weak and are unable to 
crystallize an executive formula to end Arab disputes. 
  The Kuwaiti heir apparent stressed "the need to go back a 
little and learn from the lessons and wounds of Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait." He said that "Yemeni citizens are suffering a great 
deal as a result of the conflict, which is unjustly shedding 
Arab blood. They need a real stand assuring them that everyone 
supports them against any aggression." He added: "As a Kuwaiti 
Arab, I had hoped I would hear such stands, telling us as 
Kuwaitis and Arabs: You are not alone...we support you...we are 
against aggression and for the return of legitimacy. I register 
here the courageous stands adopted by the brothers and friends, 
especially the position adopted by the custodian of the two holy 
mosques [King Fahd of Saudi Arabia], whose position was 
characterized by manhood, courage, and matching words with 
actions." 
  Asked about the security situation in Kuwait, the Kuwaiti 
heir apparent said that "security has been among the 
government's top priorities since liberation. We will not allow 
anyone to carry out any action that endangers the homeland's and 
citizens' security or shakes confidence in the security 
services' capability under any justification." 
  He also said that he "shares with the Kuwaitis their 
security 
concern over the situation represented in the existence of the 
Iraqi regime as a source of threat to Kuwaiti security and its 
unwillingness to implement Resolution 833 stipulating border 
demarcation between Kuwait and Iraq." He stressed that "the 
brothers' and friends' continued support for the just Kuwaiti 
demands and their insistence on implementing all UN resolutions 
reassures the Kuwaiti people and reduces the gravity of the 
Iraqi threat." 
  On cooperation between the government and the Kuwaiti 
National Assembly, Shaykh Sa'd pointed out that "the new 
formation of the Kuwaiti Government embodies the government's 
determination to implement its strategy concerning Kuwait's 
future and to step up cooperation with the National Assembly." 
He said that "what is being debated in this connection does not 
reach the point of a dispute. It reflects differing views among 
the sons of one country. Those in charge of the executive 
authority and the legislative authority are passengers of one 
ship called Kuwait, and no one wishes to sink this ship. 
Everyone wants to lead it to the shore of safety." 
  The Kuwaiti heir apparent said that his government's 
conditions for clearing the Arab atmosphere were mentioned in 
the government's statement, which includes the following: 
  A. The emphasis on Iraq's implementation of the Security 
Council resolutions. 
  B. The release of the POW's and those held by the Iraqi 
regime. 
  He pointed out that "Kuwait is not setting impossible 
conditions to clear the atmosphere. But before starting to 
clear the atmosphere, the cause must be eliminated." He said 
that "Kuwait has begun steps in this connection represented in 
the tour of the Arab Maghreb states by the first deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, during which he discussed Kuwaiti 
rights." 
  Shaykh Sa'd emphasized that "Kuwait has learned numerous 
lessons from the Iraqi aggression. The scheme was not limited 
to Kuwait. It was a scenario for an expansionist plan, but God's 
will aborted it." He said that "we should remember before 
clearing the atmosphere that the Iraqi aggression still exists. 
And if the brothers in the Gulf believe -- even `25 percent' -- 
that Iraq has no expansionist ambitions, they are completely 
wrong. Because the Iraqi regime is still working to complete 
its forces in order to fragment and weaken the unity of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council and then implement its expansionist schemes. 
The brothers in the Gulf must realize this reality and apply 
lessons we have all learned from the invasion. The picture of 
the Kuwait aggression must be clear to all. And we must 
cooperate to avert danger by unifying our aim, uniting ranks, 
and joining forces." 
  He declined to speculate about the Kuwaiti position if Iraq 
agrees to normalize relations with Israel in return for lifting 
the international blockade. He said "Kuwait will deal with new 
developments as its strategy and known fixed positions 
supportive of right and peace dictate."

  [Excerpts] Washington, 11 May -- The Embassy of the State 
of Kuwait in the United States categorically has denied reports 
by a local U.S. newspaper on the visit of the high-ranking 
Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to Washington that is scheduled 
for next week. 
  The responsible official at the embassy told KUNA today that 
the newspaper's report, citing sources at the embassy to the 
effect that the predominant impression is that the Kuwaiti 
delegation's visit was coming at an unsuitable time and without 
being preceded by any coordination measures, was "entirely 
untrue and unrealistic." 
  The source pointed out that the "intensive program that has 
been prepared for this visit clearly shows that officials at the 
U.S. Administration and the Congress welcomed the visit and 
expressed readiness to meet the delegation. Numerous high-level 
meetings have been arranged with the leaderships of the Senate 
and the Congress, in addition to meetings with high-ranking 
officials in the administration, be it at the White House or the 
State and Defense Department levels. 
  The diplomatic official at the Embassy of the State of 
Kuwait 
in Washington said that the program of the Kuwaiti parliamentary 
delegation's visit, headed by Assembly Speaker Ahmad 'Abd 
al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, includes press and media conferences with 
the leading U.S. newspapers and media institutions in the 
capital, Washington. [passage omitted] 
  He concluded his statement by saying that "all these efforts 
are undoubtedly at variance with the newspaper's report, which 
regrettably has not contacted the officials at the embassy who 
are responsible for this visit to verify the truth of the 
statements that the newspaper published." 
  The source said that "the embassy was not aware that any of 
its members had made statements to any newspaper or any other 
quarter that were contradictory to what we have said."

  [Text] Pursuant to instructions from brother Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential 
Council, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani yesterday visited the 
families of the victims of the spiteful missile aggression. He 
extended condolences on behalf of the brother president. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani had earlier inspected the 
situation of the people at the site of the ugly, odious crime 
committed by the forces of apostasy and secession when a missile 
fell on the homes of secure citizens. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that brother Lt. 
Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has instructed the competent 
authorities to reconstruct the houses that were destroyed at the 
expense of the state, and to give 100,000 riyals in aid to each 
affected family.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz held a meeting 
with Ibrahim Gambari, the Security Council's president and 
Nigeria's UN representative, at the United Nations headquarters 
today, Thursday, morning. 
  Following the 40-minute meeting, 'Aziz told reporters that 
he 
discussed with the Security Council's president issues related 
to the council's resolutions in light of Iraq's fulfillment of 
its commitments stipulated in these resolutions. 
  'Aziz added: The meeting was fruitful. I explained to the 
council's president Iraq's position, which strongly demands that 
the council acknowledge the facts showing that Iraq has 
implemented a great deal of the council's resolutions, and that 
concerned UN circles have confirmed these facts in their reports. 
  The deputy prime minister said the tendency of some Security 
Council members to fail to acknowledge this reality is the wrong 
approach and that the council should rectify this matter. 'Aziz 
said the refusal by one member to acknowledge this reality will 
harm the Security Council's credibility and the legitimacy of 
its resolutions. 
  Asked about the U.S. and British positions on Iraq, 'Aziz 
said: When the dispute began, they told the council and the 
whole world that they did not have bilateral differences with 
Iraq, that they behaved according to the bases of international 
law, and that they prepared Security Council resolutions to 
address the issue on this basis. However, if they change their 
position four years later and say that the issue is not within 
the United Nations' terms of reference, and that it only has to 
do with their policy, then this is something different, which 
means the entire issue has changed. They should determine 
whether they are abiding by the resolutions, which they wrote 
themselves, or whether they used these resolutions to achieve a 
political purpose of their own.

<F P=106> [Second and final installment of an exclusive interview with </F>
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz by MILLIYET correspondent Nur 
Batur in Baghdad; date not given] 
  [Text] [Batur] Do you regard the embargo as a measure to 
oppose the Iraqi administration? 
  ['Aziz] It is an insult not only to the Iraqi administration 
but also the Iraqi people. The UN officials wish to distribute 
foodstuffs and pharmaceutical drugs in Iraq even though they 
know that foodstuffs are already being distributed in our 
country. They just wish to impose that condition. 
  [Batur] How has the Saddam administration been able to 
remain 
on its feet despite the pressure to which it has been subjected 
for so many years? 
  ['Aziz] This shows the healthy relations between the Iraqi 
people and administration. Otherwise, no administration would 
have survived that pressure. The CIA has drawn up plans and 
designs against the administration. However, the government has 
remained on its feet... [ellipsis as published] 
  [Batur] Has the CIA tried to have Saddam Husayn ousted? 
  ['Aziz] That has been disclosed by the U.S. officials 
themselves. It is not an Iraqi claim. They supported the 
opposition groups in Iraq with $30-$40 million. However, they 
got nothing from it. 
  [Batur] Do you think a democratic process could be a way out 
for Iraq? 
  ['Aziz] We have our own standards of democratization. We 
cannot adopt liberal standards similar to those in the United 
States and Western Europe. Iraq existed for thousands of years 
before the United States appeared in the international arena. 
It decides for itself what it wishes to do. It has decided to 
keep its present administration. 
  [Batur] Will Iraq not disintegrate if the present state of 
affairs is allowed to continue? 
  ['Aziz] No, it will not. It was said in 1990, 1991, and 1992 
that the disintegration of Iraq was only a matter of minutes 
away. Predictions were made that our country would break up 
within six months and the administration would be ousted. 
However, it has not disintegrated, nor will it. We have 
remained on our feet for 6,000 years. 
  [Batur] Is it true that an effort is being made to establish 
a Kurdish State in northern Iraq? The framework of that state 
will be established in due time... 
  ['Aziz] No, I do not think so. There is no potential for the 
establishment of a Kurdish state. The present state of affairs 
is an artificial situation created by the United States. We 
reached an agreement with the Kurdish leaders in 1991. They 
were ready to sign it. 
  [Batur] Was it only Democratic Party Leader of Kurdistan 
Mas'ud Barzani who was ready? Was Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
Leader Jalal Talabani also prepared to sign it? 
  ['Aziz] Barzani was prepared to do so. However, Talabani 
changes his mind every two hours. Barzani said that he needed a 
few weeks to secure the support of the people. He was 
immediately summoned to Washington and London. The U.S. and 
British Administrations instructed him not to sign that 
agreement. Actually, the agreement was a democratic accord. It 
would have served both sides' interests. However, Washington 
and London obstructed it. 
  [Batur] Was it the objective of establishing a Kurdish State 
that caused the failure of that agreement? 
  ['Aziz] No, it was not. However, they were convinced that 
the agreement would strengthen the Saddam Administration. That 
is why they blocked it. Nevertheless, they did not support the 
establishment of a Kurdish State. The Kurds were used in the 
past, and they are still being used. They were used as a trump 
card to weaken the Iraqi Government in the 1970's. The U.S. 
officials are again using the Kurdish problem card against the 
Iraqi administration at the present time. 
  [Batur] The Kurds continue to fear Baghdad... 
  ['Aziz] Why are they afraid? 
  [Batur] Well, they were attacked in the past. 
  ['Aziz] Why should they be attacked--that is, unless they 
attack the Iraqi administration first? Several factions in the 
political parties headed by Talabani and Barzani cooperated with 
Iran and were attacked for that reason. They opposed Iraq when 
the United States and its Western allies were at war with our 
country. They are receiving material aid from Washington and 
London to use against their own people right now. However, the 
majority of the Kurdish people do not support the Kurdish 
leaders' policies.

<F P=106> [Report by Cristina Karrer] </F>
  [Text] Salah al-Din, Northern Iraq, May 13 (AFP) -- More 
than 100 people have been killed in the past two weeks in 
clashes between the two main Kurdish groups which have split 
northern Iraq, leaders from both sides said. 
  The fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK 
of 
Jalal Talabani) and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK of 
Mas'ud Barzani) ended early this week, they said. 
  The DPK has taken the control of the northwestern of 
Kurdistan around the town of Dahuk, while the PUK had seized the 
southeast, around al-Sulaymaniyah, an AFP correspondent said. 
  The two groups share with the Iraqi National Congress (INC) 
the province of Irbil in the middle of the Kurdish-controlled 
area of northern Iraq. 
  The INC, which says it represents all the Kurdish and Arab 
factions opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, brokered a 
ceasefire agreement on Sunday. It is based in Salah al-Din near 
Irbil. 
  The fighting erupted after a private quarrel, the PUK said. 
  The only clause of the ceasefire so far implemented provides 
for INC militiamen to control checkpoints in the Irbil province, 
along with equal numbers of PUK and DPK fighters. 
  INC official Kan'an Makkiyah told AFP Muslim Shiite fighters 
from southern Iraq were chosen to be deployed on the checkpoints. 
  The two remaining clauses of the May 8 agreement, that have 
not been yet implemented, provide for prisoner exchanges and the 
handing back of captured offices. 
  Makkiyah said the PDK [as received] has given the INC, which 
is to supervise the prisoners exchange, a list of 93 people were 
being held by the PUK. 
  A DPK official denied his group attacked the PUK in Dahuk. 
"We only surrounded their offices to force them to surrender 
peacefully," he told AFP. 
  PUK spokesman Muhammad Tawfiq said his faction "has taken 
over" the DPK offices in al-Sulaymaniyah only after its own 
offices in Dahuk were attacked. 
  Most of the casualties followed the PUK assault on Qal'at 
Dizah and Raniyah, near the Iranian border, on May 2, sources 
from both parties said. Twelve were killed in al-Sulaymaniyah 
and 12 in Salah al-Din. 
  The official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Monday 
that 
2,800 were killed in the fighting.

  [Text] Staff General Husayn Kamil Hasan, minister of 
industry and minerals, has announced the arrival of a ship on 11 
May, carrying 236 harvesters and a number of tractors. 
  In a statement to INA, he said these harvesters and tractors 
will be immediately distributed by a specialized committee to 
farmers in all the country's governorates. They will be used in 
the current agricultural and harvest campaign. 
  Staff Gen. Husayn Kamil Hasan said the Ministry of Industry 
and Minerals and the industrial sectors have always been the 
first to support the agricultural sector, with equipment, 
requirements, fertilizers, and pesticides, with the objective of 
developing agriculture, increasing production in our country, 
and improving its quality. 
  He said all this is pursuant to the instructions of leader 
President Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him, and his 
excellency's continuous care for developing the agricultural 
sector and for increasing its capacity and capabilities in order 
to secure abundant food for our lofty Iraqi people and to break 
the blockade imposed by the unjust ones on our struggler 
country. May God grant us success to serve our people under the 
leadership of the architect of Iraq's glory, leader President 
Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him. 
  A shipment of harvesters and tractors arrived earlier this 
year, and was distributed to farmers. Other shipments of 
harvesters and tractors will arrive later.

  [Text] Rafah, 12 May (MENA) -- A new batch of Palestinian 
police entered Gaza via the Rafah crossing point today. For the 
first time they were accompanied by a doctor. 
  Brigadier Ahmad Hasan Mifrid, commander of the Palestinian 
police coming from Yemen, has stated his group comprises 450 
officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates, adding that 
the remaining forces will arrive in Egypt from Yemen later. 
There, they will assemble before entering Gaza and Jericho. 
  Major General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majayrah, commander of the 
camp where Palestinian troops assemble in Egypt, has stated that 
approximately 200 personnel are scheduled to enter [Gaza] 
tomorrow, Friday, and a similar number on Saturday, pending the 
approval of the Israeli side. He noted that preparations are 
under way to assemble the remaining troops coming from Sudan, 
Algeria, and Libya. He added that the troops will take over 
their posts and deploy immediately upon their entry into the 
territories. The total number of security men coming from 
abroad via Egypt and Jordan will be approximately 7,000, he 
added. 
  Meanwhile, approximately 200 security men are scheduled to 
cross the Allenby Bridge from Jordan on their way to Jericho 
tomorrow. For the second time, Israel yesterday refused entry to 
seven Palestinian policemen and turned them back to Egypt, 
claiming that their names were wrong. 
  North Sinai Governor Munir Shash has decided to exempt the 
Palestinian police forces from paying the 16-pound exit fee paid 
by travelers using the Rafah border point.

  [Text] Rafah, 12 May (MENA) -- In a new development, today 
Israel postponed the entry of the third batch of the Palestinian 
police force through the Rafah land border after they had 
crossed from the Egyptian side. Israel has allowed 99 policemen 
to enter of the total of 450 individuals who were supposed to 
enter. The rest were returned to the Egyptian side after they 
had left the Egyptian borders. 
  Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majaydah, commander of 
the Palestinian police force, stated that it was previously 
agreed upon that 450 members of the Palestinian police force 
would enter. Israel approved this, but the rest of the group has 
been turned back, and a postponement for technical reasons has 
been requested. 
  The commander of the forces said the Palestinian forces are 
completely ready and prepared to enter immediately once 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat issues his instructions in 
accordance with Israel's approval. However, now this entry is 
being prevented and there are attempts to hamper the entry 
process. 
  Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq praised Egypt's efforts and the 
facilities the government is providing to support the cause and 
facilitate the entry of the forces into the autonomy areas in 
Gaza and Jericho.

  [Text] Rafah, 12 May (MENA) -- Tonight, Israel agreed to 
allow the rest of the Palestinian police force, the third batch, 
into the autonomy areas through the Rafah crossing point. 
  Israel previously allowed only 99 of 450 members of the 
third 
batch through, for reasons that Israel claimed were technical. 
  Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majaydah, commander of 
the Palestinian forces, stated that Israel decided to prevent 
popular receptions for the Palestinian people to welcome their 
returning forces. 
  He said an agreement was reached between the Palestinian and 
the Israeli sides to allow 250 members of the Palestinian police 
to cross tomorrow morning through the Rafah border post. The 
forces in Jordan will also enter through the Allenby Bridge. 
  He added that other forces will arrive from Libya, Sudan, 
and 
Algeria. They will all gather in Rafah to prepare to enter the 
autonomy areas in stages following the approval of the Israeli 
side. 
  [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0601 GMT on 13 
May adds the following: "Three hundred Palestinian policemen 
crossed into the West Bank from Jordan overnight and headed by 
bus for the Gaza Strip under Israeli army escort, a military 
spokesman said Friday. 
  ["The men from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) will join 
300 of their comrades who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and 
Wednesday nights through the Rafah border from Egypt. 
  ["`They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and 
will probably enter Gaza from the south,' the spokesman said. 
  ["They belong to the PLA's "Badr" brigade stationed in 
Jordan 
and were driving down the Dead Sea, up through the Negev desert 
and across west to the Strip. 
  ["The men were armed but without munitions, which were held 
only by one officer on each of the 10 buses."] 
  ["Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to 
follow later Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the 
West Bank town and the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians under the 
autonomy deal signed on May 4. 
  ["And 300 more Palestinian police had been stuck all night 
at 
the Rafah border because of what PLO officials described as `a 
big problem', but refused to elaborate. 
  ["Palestinian sources said the Israeli authorities objected 
to certain names among the 300 and that a major argument 
ensued."]

  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat is demanding that Israel immediately 
transfer to the Palestinians self-government powers in all of 
the West Bank. 'Arafat raised this demand during his meeting 
with President 'Ezer Weizman in Pretoria. This was learned by 
our correspondent 'Imanu'el Halperin. Prime Minister Rabin was 
briefed about this development. 
  The Swiss president, who also met with Mr. Weizman in South 
Africa, proposed to establish a sixth committee in the framework 
of the multilateral talks. His proposal calls for establishing 
a committee to deal with human rights in the region. The 
deliberations of this committee would be coordinated by 
Switzerland. Israel will examine the proposal.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, adviser to PLO </F>
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the 
studio, on 12 May; from the "With The Events" feature -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th in Cairo, good evening. 
Jericho tomorrow and Gaza next week. The challenges are great 
and you must have something to say on this occasion? 
  [Sha'th] The Palestinian people have been anticipating this 
day for a long time. True, there are challenges and 
difficulties and, true, there is responsibility that comes with 
freedom, but this is the opportunity for the Palestinian people 
to govern themselves on their soil. It starts here in Gaza and 
Jericho. This is the starting point for a people who have 
suffered for a long time. Now, the horizons of freedom and 
independence have begun to be seen over their soil. This people 
and their leadership must rise to the level of responsibility. 
Freedom and independence, even at the starting point, means 
great responsibility in terms of the people's security, freedom, 
free expression, participation in decisions, and the tiring work 
to achieve economic development and social justice. All these 
things are required from us when we take the first step in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  [Mu'addi] The challenges are great, and the PLO is suffering 
a financial crisis that even caused a delay in the transfer of 
powers. What has happened? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, we are facing a financial problem. This 
problem has made our entry more difficult, but we are gradually 
overcoming this problem. I am confident that the presence of 
the police force inside Gaza and Jericho will be received with 
thousands of invitations and real support from the citizens. I 
believe we have all seen the cordial welcome they received. 
This, however, will not substitute for the money needed for 
equipment, uniforms, and transportation. We are seriously 
seeking to overcome these problems. The United States and the 
European Union have pledged funds, while equipment and other 
items will be coming from Japan, France, Greece, Germany, and 
other countries. We are working day and night to realize this 
support and transfer it to the Palestinian police force as soon 
as possible. 
  [Mu'addi] What will be the future steps after the assumption 
of powers and the establishment of self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho, which will apparently start be next week? 
  [Sha'th] I have always told people the difficult phase is 
over, but the more difficult phase is still ahead of us. 
Undoubtedly, the transfer is important, but now we have to 
discuss how to form a competent, clean, and responsible 
government. How do we start the measures for economic 
development? How do we start preparations for elections? 
Above all, how do we continue negotiations to assume powers in 
the West Bank and reach an agreement on the interim phase in the 
West Bank and Gaza which will lead to the withdrawal of Israeli 
troops from cities and camps in the West Bank? All these 
matters are required. Some resulted from the signing of the 
agreement. Other topics must also be discussed after the 
transfer to Gaza and Jericho. These are missions for the 
forthcoming phase. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has struggled for a long time to 
see the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Will 
Nabil Sha'th be a member of the long-awaited Palestinian 
national authority? 
  [Sha'th] I will do whatever I am asked to do by my people 
and leadership. I devoted myself a long time ago to serve this 
people and their cause. I will not hesitate to serve my people 
in any position. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.

  [Text] Assessing the results of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, 
Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation in the 
talks with Israel, has said that, in view of the Declaration of 
Principles signed in Oslo, we have obtained the best possible 
results. The worst of the Oslo agreement was the issues we 
decided to postpone -- for example, the settlements, the issue 
of the 1948 refugees, external security, and Jerusalem. 
  He added: In my opinion, we have obtained the best 
conditions even on the postponed issues, particularly the 
settlements. The whole conflict in this agreement was on how to 
reduce the area of the settlements and Israel's control over 
them during the transitional period. 
  Dr. Sha'th added that the agreement does not limit the 
demand 
for legitimate rights in the forthcoming period. We have added 
a clause to the effect that, whatever happens during the 
transitional period, our rights in the final phase will not be 
affected. The land in the West Bank and Gaza will also remain a 
single regional unit. There was also another clause which 
stipulated that whatever we signed in the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
did not constitute a renunciation of any of our rights. Sha'th 
also said that Israel has no right to reoccupy Gaza if 
settlements and settlers are exposed to danger. 
  Concerning foreign relations, Dr. Sha'th pointed out that 
Israel advocated that the Palestinian authority should not be 
allowed to exercise foreign relations. More than this, the PLO 
would not be allowed to exercise these relations on behalf of 
this authority, something which we rejected, he said. According 
to the agreement, countries and international organizations have 
the right to establish representation bureaus in the self-rule 
area, but the Palestinian authority cannot have embassies other 
than embassies of Palestine. 
  On the outstanding points of difference after the signing of 
the agreement, and the talks to be held about it, Dr. Sha'th 
said that all these issues are remnants of the Cairo security 
agreement: these are the Mawasi beach in Gaza, the Jericho 
crossing point, the Rafah crossing point, the area of Jericho, 
and the presence of Palestinian soldiers on the Allenby bridge. 
The talks will continue around four main axes, among which are 
the gaining of early authority in the West Bank, to include 
education, culture, tourism, taxes, social affairs, police, and 
so on. We will also start negotiating over the withdrawal of 
the Israeli forces from the West Bank and the holding of 
legislative elections in it. The four-man committee would start 
negotiating on the return of the refugees after a month. 
  Dr. Sha'th pointed out in a press statement that the talks 
on 
the refugees will revolve around two issues only. These are 
return measures and measures for maintaining security and order; 
there will not merely be discussions of the same principle.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, has 
announced that President 'Arafat today approved the nomination 
of 15 members of the Palestinian Authority Council in Gaza and 
Jericho. He said that he informed Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin of this today so that the authorities would 
receive this information through official channels, and not to 
ask Israel for approval of the Council members. 
  He added that the Council chairman will be Yasir 'Arafat. It 
will include 14 members. These are: Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh 
Abu-Midyan, Faysal al-Husayni, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Dr. Riyad 
al-Za'nun, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Haj Ahmad, Ilyas Furayj, Ahmad Quray' alias 
Abu-'Ala', Samir Ghawshah, Yasir 'Amr, Mrs. Intisar al-Wazir 
alias Umm Jihad, and Mrs. Hanan al-'Ashrawi. 
  Sha'th told his news conference at the Foreign 
Correspondents 
Association in Cairo today that all these members have agreed to 
take part in the first Palestinian Authority Council, and their 
nomination has been approved by the PLO Executive Committee. 
  He noted that in the next four days, nine other members will 
be nominated, thus completing the formation of the Council, 
which will consist of 24 members. He said that the Council will 
start its duties immediately. He expected that this will take 
place on Wednesday, 18 May, in Gaza-Jericho and will constitute 
the first Palestinian National Authority on Palestinian 
territory. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that among the members of the Council 
are two former deportees, 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Haj Ahmad and 'Azmi 
al-Shu'aybi. There are also two women: Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi and 
Intisar al-Wazir. Among them also is one of Jerusalem's 
prominent sons, namely Faysal al-Husayni. 
  Dr. Sha'th added that the members of the Council have not 
yet 
been allocated their portfolios. He clarified that in 
accordance with the protocol that was signed last week, the PLO 
will continue to be the legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people until their Palestinian state is established. 
He said that the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho is a 
part of the PLO, which supervises the liberated territories. 
  He added that foreign relations and the Palestine Liberation 
Army's affairs outside the Palestinian territories, as well as 
the national and international relations will continue to be the 
responsibilities of the PLO headquarters in Tunis. These 
affairs will be administered by three prominent members from the 
PLO Executive Committee--namely, Faruq Qaddumi for foreign 
diplomatic relations, Mahmud 'Abbas for national relations with 
Jewish organizations, and 'Abdallah Hurani for the Palestine 
Liberation Army. 
  On the delay in the Palestinian Authority's assumption of 
its 
duties in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said that this is due to very 
difficult circumstances because of the Palestinian diaspora. 
Thankfully, Saudi planes have transported members of the police 
from Yemen to Sinai. Saudi planes will also transport those 
coming from Algeria. Those coming from Libya will travel by car 
thousands of kilometers to cross through the al-Sallum border 
post to Sinai. 
  Egyptian planes have transported those coming from Sudan. 
  In this regard, Sha'th thanked President Husni Mubarak; King 
Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques; 
and the Arab countries who have provided and continue to provide 
all the necessary facilities to transport these forces. 
  Sha'th expressed his belief that these forces will complete 
their arrival in Gaza and Jericho within the next few days. 
  He said that the Palestinian Authority would like the 
financial allocations from the donor countries to arrive quickly 
so that it can be spent on this police force. He noted that 
there is positive international action by the United States, 
Japan, and the European countries to hasten this process. Also, 
a batch of new cars for this police will arrive in Port Said 
sometime next week. 
  He said that this positive attitude reflects the extent of 
the world's interest in backing the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  On the relationships of the newborn Palestinian Authority 
in Gaza and Jericho, Dr. Sha'th said that this authority is part 
of the PLO, and although the latter is entrusted with 
representing the Palestinian people and negotiating and signing 
on its behalf, the Authority will be in charge of implementing 
the agreement on the scene. He added: Both the Palestinian 
people and Israel want to the retain the PLO at present. The 
Palestinians believe that the PLO is their representative until 
the state of Palestine is officially established. Israel would 
like to continue to negotiate and cooperate with the PLO in 
order to avoid the establishment of the Palestinian state. But, 
he added, the establishment of this state has become inevitable, 
no matter how long it takes. 
  In reply to a question about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's recent statement that Jerusalem is the capital of the 
State of Israel, Dr. Sha'th said: Rabin has no right to say 
this because, according to the Declaration of Principles, 
Jerusalem is an issue in the bilateral negotiations. If Rabin 
wishes it to be the capital of Israel, we in turn insist on 
making Jerusalem the capital of Palestine. He added: Since 
Israel has agreed to share the land of Palestine with us, why 
does it not agree then to let us both share Jerusalem? 
  In reply to a question on why Israel has not released the 
remaining Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Dr. Sha'th 
emphasized that he is confident that they will all be released. 
He explained that Israel would like to hand over many of them 
to the Palestinian Authority when it takes over, especially 
those convicted of ordinary crimes. Their cases will be left 
for the Palestinian Authority to decide on. As for the members 
of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and al-Jihad 
movements, they have not been released so far because they have 
not signed a declaration to the Israeli authorities accepting 
the peace agreement. Maybe they do not want to sign such a 
declaration for the Israeli authorities but might sign for the 
Palestinian Authority so as to be released. 
  On 'Arafat's entry into Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th referred to 
'Arafat's statements that this will take place in early June. 
But, he added, 'Arafat has his own surprises. We don't know. 
The date might be before then. 
  On the differences between the Palestinian organizations, 
especially Hamas and al-Jihad, Dr. Sha'th said that there is an 
agreement that these differences should be kept within the 
democratic framework and not turned into acts of violence. He 
stressed his conviction that all the Palestinian organizations 
care about this democratic dialogue in order to establish the 
Palestinian state and ensure the success of the agreement as the 
first step toward the establishment of the state of Palestine. 
  Dr. Sha'th went on to say that the PLO, which is 
headquartered in Tunis, will remain in charge of the affairs of 
the refugees outside the liberated areas in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip and that the Palestine National Council [PNC], 
which includes members from inside and outside the territories, 
will remain the highest legislative Palestinian authority. 
  Sha'th went on to say that the coming elections in the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are scheduled to be held after 
three months, will be for the election of the members of the PNC 
from inside the territories, who were formerly appointed. He 
said: These members comprise a third of the PNC members but at 
the same time constitute the Palestinian Authority's parliament 
inside the territories. 
  In response to a question about the Palestinian diplomatic 
missions abroad, he said that they will remain the prerogative 
of the PLO headquartered in Tunis, but all countries will have 
the right to open representation offices in Gaza and Jericho 
until the Palestinian state is established. 
  On the new Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, Sha'th said that 
Acting Ambassador Zuhdi al-Qidrah will be appointed the 
Palestinian state's ambassador in Cairo.

<F P=106> [Article by Lamis K. Andoni: "PLO Reformists Gain Strength </F>
Ahead of Self-Rule"] 
  [Text] Deliberations to form a Palestinian authority have 
triggered an unprecedented internal power struggle as 
Palestinian officials and leaders seem determined to put an end 
to Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat's single-handed leadership prior to moving to Jericho 
and Gaza. 
  So far most PLO officials and leaders from the 
Israeli-occupied territories have declined to take part in the 
25-member authority either in protest against the agreement on 
Palestinan autonomy signed in Cairo on May 4, or against Mr. 
'Arafat autocratic style, which, they fear, will dominate the 
new authority. 
  Prior to Mr. 'Arafat's departure for South Africa to attend 
the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela, the PLO leadership 
in Tunis challenged his attempt to single-handedly appoint the 
Palestinian authority. 
  But, during his brief stay in South Africa, the PLO chairman 
defied the challenge by appointing by telephone four members 
from the occupied territories. 
  So far the four leaders from the occupied territories, who 
are said to have accepted membership in the Palestinian 
authority, are Fatah head in Gaza Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh 
Abu-Middayn (also a Gaza close to Fatah), Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas 
Frayj, and the head of the Palestinian side of the liaison with 
Israel, Jamil al-Tarifi. 
  By going over the heads of the PLO Executive Committee and 
prominent PLO leaders in the occupied territories, Mr. 'Arafat 
is apparently trying to force the reluctant leaders to follow--a 
tactic that he has perfected in the past. 
  But this time the situation is more complicated as many 
officials and leaders are wary about the implications of taking 
part in an authority in charge of implementing an agreement that 
they either oppose or have strong reservations about. 
  Most, including his partners in the 30-month-of peace 
process, feel that they were marginalised in the actual 
negotiations and that Mr. 'Arafat is now trying to impose on 
them an agreement that they were not party to. 
  In a strongly-worded statment, the Palestine Democratic 
Union, FIDA, led by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, charged that the pact 
enables Israel to practically maintain its control over the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. 
  FIDA officials, however said that Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh was ready 
to take part in the Palestinian authority provided Mr. 'Arafat 
accepted clearly defined terms and democratic basis for the 
functions of the authority. 
  According to FIDA, the main immediate task is to work on 
freeing the Palestinian authority from the constraints imposed 
on it by the agreement. According to the agreement, the 
Palestinian authority cannot take major or minor decisions 
without the approval of the Israeli side through a maze of joint 
committees and subcommittees that will oversee its 
implementation. 
  Some argue that it is already too late to try to alter the 
role of the Palestinian authority that has been limitted by the 
terms of the agreement. 
  Some argue that it is already too late to try to alter the 
role of the Palestinian authority that has been limitted by the 
terms of the agreement. 
  The Palestine People's party (PPP), which maintains such a 
view, has already informed Mr. 'Arafat that it was not 
participating in the Palestinian authority according to the 
conditions outlined in the Israeli-Palestinian pact. 
  But it seems that Mr. 'Arafat has underestimated early signs 
of defiance by completely ignoring last-minute appeals to him 
not to sign the agreement as soon as the details became known to 
his colleagues and PLO leaders in the occupied territories. 
  Both Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah's leader in the West Bank, and 
Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Washington bilateral talks, had urged Mr. 'Arafat not to sign 
the pact and try to renegotiate some of its terms. 
  In a lengthy memo to the PLO chairman, Dr. 'Urayqat wrote 
that the pact aimed "at perpetuating, instead of ending, the 
occupation." 
  Mr. 'Arafat was not able to secure full-fledged support for 
the accord by his own PLO Executive Committee or the Fatah 
Central Committee. At a meeting in Tunis on May [no date 
given], Mr. 'Arafat was said to have not even sought the 
approval of his colleagues as the issue was presented as a fait 
accompli. 
  PLO Executive Committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi 
was particularly outraged by the terms of the economic agreement 
signed in Paris on April 29. 
  In an internal memo to the PLO Executive Committee, made 
available to the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. al-Nashashibi said that the 
Paris pact allowed Israel total control over the Palestinian 
economy through the joint Palestinian-Israeli economic 
committee. In Mr. al-Nashashibi's view, by allowing Israel to 
share, If not to control, economic decision-making, the pact 
will obstruct the building of a Palestinian national economy. 
  Mr. al-Nashashibi is said to have declined membership in the 
Palestinian authority. 
  A senior Fatah Central Committee member, Hani al-Hasan, 
believes that the Paris economic accord is the most dangerous 
part of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. 
  Mr. al-Hasan, and his brother, Khalid, who is currently 
under 
medical treatment at the Farah centre of the al-Husayn Medical 
City, are both against the accord and refuse to move to Jericho 
and Gaza under its terms. 
  So far Mr. 'Arafat has failed in talking any of the 
cofounders of his Fatah movement to join the authority, as head 
of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi has already 
refused to be part of the new authority. 
  The only exception could be Intisar al-Wazir, widow of PLO 
military leader Khalil al-Wazir, Abu-Jihad, who has reluctantly 
accepted her appointment to the authority. 
  But if most PLO leaders are mainly reacting to being 
excluded 
from the negotiations process, resulting in an agreement they 
were not party to, Mr. 'Arafat is not having an easier time with 
two of his closest partners that continued with the deal all the 
way through the signing, PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 
'Abbas and economic chief Ahmad Quray'. 
  Both are said to have declined invitations to join the 
Palestinian authority citing differences with Mr. 'Arafat over 
the handling of the Palestine Economic Council for Development 
and Reconstruction (PECDAR). 
  Analysts and PLO officials, however, believe that Mr. 
'Arafat 
will eventually succeed in forming a Palestinan authority. But 
they say the body will not be a strong one if he failed to 
recruit credible names with broad following in the occupied 
territories, especially after losing the support of important 
leaders like the estranged chief Palestinan negotiator Haydar 
'Abd al-Shafi. 
  But many, including opponents of the peace pact, now argue 
that the only way to contain the damage and to open the way for 
the emergence of strong nationalist leaders is to ensure that 
free elections will be held after the setting up of the 
Palestinian authonomy.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Jamal </F>
al-Surani by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khashanah] How do you interpret the delay in 
appointing members of the Palestinian authority, despite the 
Executive Committee's extensive meetings? 
  [Al-Surani] Forming the Palestinian authority or the 
government is not an easy issue that can be ended in hours or 
days. There are numerous normal contacts, because we are moving 
from one phase to another...from the revolution, which has 
numerous concerns but limited requirements, to the phase of 
taking responsibility for a people's life, including health, 
education, housing, transportation, post, food, electricity, and 
other needs. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] When will consultations be completed as regards 
forming the authority, and when will it be officially announced? 
  [Al-Surani] We must first complete the consultations between 
those inside and those outside and also among those outside. It 
is a difficult equation. The objective is to ensure that the 
ship is heading -- right from the start -- toward the shore of 
safety. 
  [Khashanah] Have you agreed at least on the foundations and 
criteria? 
  [Al-Surani] That too is among the issues we are currently 
discussing. I expect the consultations to be completed within a 
week or 10 days at the latest. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] In practice, how will the Executive Committee be 
the authority for the National Authority? 
  [Al-Surani] That decision was taken by the Central Council 
in its October session, because the Executive Committee 
represents the Palestinian people's unity. If the national 
authority inside is for those inside only, it would be as if we 
are saying that the Palestinian people in the diaspora have 
nothing to do with Palestine. The Executive Committee's being 
the authority qualifies it to continue to be the political and 
spiritual bond for the Palestinians inside, about 3 million of 
them, and the Palestinians outside, about 3 million of them. It 
means that the problem of the diaspora Palestinians will 
continue to exist and will not be solved except with the 
deferred issues -- Jerusalem, dismantling of the settlements, 
and self-determination. 
  [Khashanah] Does that mean that the Palestinian state will 
continue to be based in Tunis? 
  [Al-Surani] Foreign activity will remain in Tunis. Because 
under the accord signed in Washington, the Palestinian authority 
is not entitled to have foreign relations. But the PLO has 
secured the recognition of 127 states, and we shall safeguard 
these relations and exploit them in the interests of our people 
inside and outside. Because it is unreasonable for Israel to be 
in charge of our relations with the world, especially as we have 
secured this international recognition through the sacrifices 
made by our people. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] It is said that there are criticisms against 
granting Fatah sensitive posts.... 
  [Al-Surani] First, no one disputes that Fatah is the mother 
organization. Second, those who get posts now are not the 
winners, because the early posts are very demanding. Anyhow, 
such talk did not take place at the Executive Committee's 
meetings. On the contrary, it asked everyone to participate, 
the Popular Front, Hamas, the Democratic Front.... 
  [Khashanah] What will the Executive Committee's fate be 
after the formation of the authority and its entry into Jericho? 
  [Al-Surani] It will continue to exist and operate until the 
National Council elects a new Executive Committee at its next 
session.

  [Text] Sa'ib 'Urayqat, who is a member of the Palestinian 
Autonomy Council, said that within a short time committees would 
be appointed to manage the Arab towns and villages inside the 
autonomous areas. These committees would make preparations to 
hold municipal elections within several months. 
  Sa'ib 'Urayqat confirmed to our correspondent Arye Gus that 
he had accepted the local government portfolio in the Autonomy 
Council. 'Urayqat, who is a Jericho resident, added that he was 
happy to see the Palestinian flag flying over the city. 
'Urayqat nevertheless noted that the Palestinians still had a 
long way to go and many challenges to face.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to Washington talks, by Sayyid 
'Abd-al-'Ati in Gaza -- date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Ati] How do you view the events and 
developments that followed the Oslo agreement? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I would like to point out that I am 
independent; that is, I am not committed to any political 
faction. To avoid ambiguity, I am not an oppositionist, but I 
express my own views as a Palestinian citizen. I have expressed 
my opinion about the Gaza-Jericho agreement right from the 
start. I believe that my mission ended with the announcement of 
the secret talks in Oslo. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has led the Palestinian 
negotiating team of the Cairo talks and you led the negotiating 
team of the Madrid process. Do you believe the change was 
intended to introduce more flexibility in the negotiations with 
the Israelis? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] The change has come because the Palestinian 
leadership wanted it, and I do not want to comment on it. As 
for the choice of Nabil Sha'th, I believe that he has followed 
the leadership's instructions, but not out of conviction. The 
Cairo agreement itself did not tackle the Israeli claims about 
several issues. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] How do you explain the fact that the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories have not come out 
to express their views on the Cairo agreement? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] The whole process has lost much of its 
credibility. Since September 1993, in many ways what had been 
told to the people about the agreement removing obstacles and 
opening the door for a just peace has turned out to be untrue. 
This is because the attitude and the practices of the Israeli 
Army remained unchanged. Their settlement activity still 
continues, as do the repressive measures. In brief, the reality 
refutes the words. As a result, the people are not pleased with 
the Cairo Agreement. Even the question of the detainees and 
their release has not been completed the way we would have 
liked. Israel turned the issue of the political detainees into 
a bargaining chip. All this has frustrated the Palestinian 
people. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] In your opinion, what are the drawbacks to 
the 
Cairo agreement? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] One of the negative points in this agreement 
is that it is subject to different interpretations. In the 
absence of equality in the balance of power, the stronger party 
will prevail. One of the most serious drawbacks is Israel's 
control of the crossing points in Rafah and at the Allenby 
Bridge. This means that Israel will control all the borders and 
exit points of Palestine. We want peace to end the sufferings of 
our people. I disagree with the opposition, which is too 
emotional in handling the differences with the PLO. 
  ['Abd-al-'Ati] Will you run in the coming elections after 
the 
establishment of the Palestinian Authority? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I do not rule out my participation in any 
coming elections when the Palestinian Authority is fully 
established. When elections are called, I will think about 
running. So long as the goal of every Palestinian is to ease the 
sufferings of his people, there is no justification for 
boycotting an election, if there is one.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Rejects Israeli Conditions for </F>
Releasing Its Prisoners"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- The Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) has refused to respond to the conditions set by 
Israeli authorities for releasing its prisoners from Israelis 
jails. It stressed that linking their release with its support 
of the Oslo agreement is "a one-upmanship rejected by our 
mujahidin." 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, said that 
the 
movement "has decided not to accept the conditions set by 
Zionist occupation authorities for releasing our prisoners, 
namely to pledge not to return to what they termed the pledge to 
continue terrorist actions, and to support the capitulationist 
Gaza-Jericho agreement." Ghawshah added in a statement that 
"the detainees' release is a natural right which should not be 
linked to the required pledge. Because the resistance against 
the occupation is a legitimate right in all values and laws 
known to mankind. Thus it is not right to describe it as a 
terrorist action. Besides, the detainees cannot abandon a 
legitimate and national duty they are performing against the 
occupation."

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA)--The Refugee Affairs Committee 
under the multilateral talks has concluded its three-day session 
here. Delegations from 40 countries, the United Nations, and the 
World Bank took part. 
  Mark Byron, Canadian deputy foreign minister who chaired the 
meetings, thanked the Egyptian Government for hosting the 
session. 
  Speaking at a news conference at the conclusion of the 
meetings, Byron said that it had discussed the items on its 
agenda. 
  On the issue of the reunification of Palestinian families, 
the group welcomed the noticeable increase in the number of 
cases since its last meeting in Tunis. He added that a French 
working group will follow up on this issue and urged the 
involved parties to show more flexibility. 
  In the sphere of developing human resources and creating new 
job opportunities for Palestinian refugees, the Canadian 
official said that the United States, Turkey, Germany, China, 
the Netherlands, and Israel have declared new initiatives aimed 
at increasing job opportunities for refugees and enabling them 
to be self-reliant. 
  The head of the working group on refugees said that 
constructive initiatives were proposed in the sphere of public 
health that took into account the needs of the refugees in the 
West Bank and the neighboring countries. 
  In the field of child care, Mark Byron said that Sweden 
proposed a plan and made an initial contribution of $2 million 
for the psychological rehabilitation program. 
  In the field of social infrastructure, the working group 
noted the need to provide for the needs of the refugees within 
the framework of what was announced previously. The group also 
heard a report by an international investigation committee on 
the living conditions of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan's 
camps. He added that it was agreed to prepare a data base for 
strengthening the Palestinian statistics office, and that 
Norway, Canada, the United States, and the EU pledged to prepare 
it. 
  The Canadian official said that improving the refugees' 
living standards will promote the peace process, noting that the 
Canadian foreign minister announced yesterday that his country 
had decided to give $2.7 million to the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency to be used to fund health, educational, and 
housing projects for refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. He 
added that the overall aid that the international community has 
pledged to the Palestinian refugees since the end of October 
1993 has reached $50 million. 
  The working group on refugees started its work on Tuesday; 
Egypt's delegation was led by Ambassador Ahmad 'Uthman.

  [Text] The electricity ministers of the five countries 
involved in the power grid linkage project -- Syria, Egypt, 
Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey -- last night concluded the meetings of 
the fourth term of their council in Cairo. 
  During their meetings, the ministers signed with the Arab 
Fund for Social and Economic Development a protocol for joint 
cooperation and financing of a five-way power linkage plan to 
complete the linkage and implement the first and second phases 
of the plan by linking Egypt with Jordan, Jordan with Syria, and 
Syria with Iraq, and the last phase by linking Turkey with Iraq. 
  The Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development and the 
Islamic Bank endorsed the financing of the plan in its three 
phases in light of coordination between the parties of the plan. 
  The electricity ministers also approved the recommendations 
of the executive committee of the power linkage project, 
including the execution of the rest of the phases of the project 
and how work will proceed. 
  At the conclusion of their meetings, the ministers agreed to 
hold the fifth session of their council on 5 April 1995 in 
Turkey. 
  During the morning session of yesterday's meetings, Engineer 
Kamil al-Baba, the electricity minister, expressed hope that the 
Syrian power network will form an important link in the power 
linkage scheme of the Arab East countries, especially after the 
implementation of many electricity schemes in Syria recently.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn to a delegation of visiting Israeli </F>
Arabs offering condolences on the death of the queen mother, at 
the Royal Court in Amman on 12 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Dear brothers; you are our kinsfolk. You have 
our appreciation for holding fast to your dear and precious land. 
  You have come to commiserate with us on the death of my 
mother, may her soul rest in peace. The Hashemite family has 
always had the privilege of being close to Palestine, its 
people, its cause, and their rights. The next generations will, 
God willing, follow the same path. If I say that, for us, you 
are family and brothers, I am stating a fact. I, and all of us 
here, thank you and appreciate your gesture. When you are in 
Amman, you are at home. I thank you for the kind words I heard 
from you. Please convey to all Arab brothers our love and 
appreciation. I hope we will be able to see you here among us 
more often. I beseech God that we are at the threshold of a new 
era under which the Palestinian people enjoy their rights on 
their national soil and in which all parties live in peace, so 
all concerned can lead secure, dignified, and free lives and 
build for the benefit of future generations what we have been 
deprived of. We take pride in our brotherhood. We will always 
be there for you. You are most welcome here. Give my 
greetings, love, and appreciation to all the kinsfolk and 
brothers on whose behalf you are visiting us to cheer us in our 
grief. 
  In any case, such is life. What has befallen us is God's 
will and our fate. Thanks be to God, a lucky human being is one 
who leaves behind the memory of his good actions. We pray to 
God that we will have been among those who reached out and were 
generous toward others, so we may have a clear conscience and 
serve our kinsfolk and do all that we can to help both present 
and future generations. Once more, I thank you; May God's peace 
and blessing be upon you. I wish you a happy stay here among 
your kinsfolk and brothers.

  [Text] The meetings of the Jordanian-Palestinian Economic 
Committee will end tomorrow. The second day's meetings ended a 
short while ago. Details are in the following report by our 
political affairs correspondent Shakir Maharimah: 
  [Begin recording] [Maharimah] The Jordanian-Palestinian 
Economic Committee resumed its meetings at the Prime Ministry 
today until late this evening. After the meeting, Mr. Ahmad 
Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department and head of the 
Palestinian side, and Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for 
cabinet affairs, minister of information, and head of the 
Jordanian side, made statements: 
  [Quray'] After this long and enjoyable round of talks and 
exchange of views with our brothers under the chairmanship of my 
brother His Excellency Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, we have prepared 
mechanisms with full understanding on both sides to implement 
the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement in the economic field. We 
discussed basic and important issues that dealt with banking and 
monetary issues, trade and customs. 
  We also set up subcommittees and they will commence their 
work immediately as of Saturday [14 May] to follow up the 
implementation of the working program. God willing, when the 
transitional stage goes into implementation, coordination will 
take place on the ground. I believe that since 1967, this is 
the first chance for us, as Palestinians, to exercise part of 
our powers usurped by the Israeli occupation authorities. 
  The first and basic reference that we resort to is this 
fraternal, brotherly, and friendly country with which we are 
linked with distinguished ties and which cannot but include all 
the visions and aspirations of our two peoples. 
  God willing, we shall meet again tomorrow and release a 
joint 
statement and agree on a working program to implement the accord 
signed on 7 January 1994. 
  [Al-'Anani] The negotiations were held in a businesslike 
atmosphere in which issues were discussed in detail. The 
discussion of the details of a mechanism took us a long time. 
It was not enough to agree on the basic principles. It was 
necessary that we work out practical steps on the ground so that 
technical experts and specialists in the various sectors could 
immediately start implementing the agreement. 
  A high spirit of cooperation permeated these meetings. Since 
our interests are interrelated, they must be organized in a 
detailed way so that people and the private sector could take 
advantage of the chances available on the ground in view of what 
is going on in the Palestinian territories in terms of changes 
we will witness on the ground. 
  In fact, I would like to thank brother Abu-'Ala' [Quray'], 
and his friends and colleagues who showed a high level of 
response to and understanding of issues that are of concern to 
us in Jordan. We found solutions to these issues, which, God 
willing, will convince the Jordanian and Palestinian people that 
we are on the road to achieving interests. God willing, we 
will avoid dangers and seek to achieve joint interests in light 
of close relations between the two people. 
  As my brother Abu-'Ala' said, we will meet in order to sign 
what we call a working plan based on the agreement. As he 
mentioned, we took a number of priorities into consideration. 
These included banking, monetary, trade, and transient issues. 
We also discussed the issue of tourism. We shall hold further 
meetings to complete the discussion of agriculture, industry, 
energy, and any other related issues. Moreover, the 
[Palestinian] brothers asked for cooperation in terms of 
exchanging expertise and technical cadres, especially since the 
required Palestinian institutions are being established. They 
received sufficient response from us. [end recording]

yesterday's sessions between the both sides. 
  The minister of information Dr. Jawad al-'Anani who is

Quray' 
said that subcommittees were set up and they will commence their

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Positive Change"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. response to Jordan's request to suspend 
the inspection at sea of ships bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah 
is a victory from the Jordanian point of view. These inspection 
operations are unjustified. They are an unacceptable 
encroachment on the rights of Jordanian navigation and trade. 
  Although the U.S. decision does not fully respond to the 
primary request to suspend the inspection operations, this 
decision in itself is a very important step to remove the 
political cover given to the multinational interception of ships 
bound for al-'Aqabah. This task was assigned to an independent, 
not-for-profit British company. This will not obstruct 
navigation because inspections will take place in the Port of 
al-'Aqabah, not at sea. Goods will be inspected after they 
enter the port, not at sea. This will save companies and ship 
owners from losses and delay. 
  Without doubt, this measure is an important retreat. It 
restores the regional role and importance of and confidence in 
the Port of al-'Aqabah. Persistent efforts to achieve this 
objective were realized in the end. There is increasing and 
renewed international satisfaction with Jordan's commitment to 
international resolutions. There is also belief in this 
country's need for compensation for the losses it suffered as a 
result of the Gulf crisis and the sanctions imposed on it, and 
that it does not need additional unjustified losses. 
  The U.S. response to the Jordanian request is a positive 
change and a very important step in the right direction on the 
road to ending all aspects of inspection. Jordan, along with 
most of the international community, hopes the U.S. stand will 
take the form of a more general and comprehensive stand to end 
the various effects and repercussions of the Gulf crisis. This 
is long overdue, now that the objectives and causes of the 
crisis have ended. Jordan hopes this will be a chance to offer 
compensation to the countries and peoples of the region that 
have suffered serious losses and damages as a result of the 
negative repercussions of the crisis, in order to open a new 
chapter of security and stability.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" article by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Syrian Queries </F>
About Depth and Scale of Withdrawal From Golan"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Although the Israeli proposals which 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher conveyed to President 
Hafiz al-Asad did not satisfy Syria, because they do not contain 
the basic "magic word," namely agreement to withdraw completely 
from the Syrian Golan Heights, the Israelis' announcement of 
their willingness to withdraw from a part of the Golan and to 
dismantle settlements there is in itself an Israeli 
acknowledgment that the land over which the two sides are 
negotiating is a Syrian territory, part of which can be 
subjected to the security arrangements and most of which can be 
returned to Syria. It also means a change in the Israeli 
language in general -- a change that is not encountering a 
Syrian rejection, but, rather, reservations about applying the 
return [al-i'adah] principle to all the land, not just part of 
it. 
  High-level Syrian sources told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli 
proposals conveyed to Damascus "did not respond to the basic 
principle in the peace process, that is, the complete withdrawal 
from the Golan." The proposals contained Israel's willingness 
to withdraw from three Syrian villages -- namely Majdal Shams, 
Buq'ata, and Sa'dah -- under a three-phase withdrawal plan over 
eight years, with "minor changes to the border" between the two 
sides, in order to "guarantee Israeli security." This is in 
addition to addressing the question of "joint management" of 
water in the Golan, which concentrates in the southern part of 
the Golan, feeding Lake Tiberias, the source of the River 
Jordan. Water in that area is estimated at 320 cubic meters. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli proposals include 
the proposal for Syria to begin to take confidence-building 
measures during the first withdrawal phase under the "Majdal 
Shams First" plan, on the basis of which the depth of the 
withdrawal and arrangements for the remaining two phases -- 
which include "dismantling settlements in the Golan," especially 
northern settlements, which already have no settlers in them -- 
would be determined. The sources did not rule out that the 
Israelis may have asked to open a tourist office in Damascus in 
the first phase to transport tourists between the two sides. 
All this -- so the Israelis believe -- would "test Syrian 
intentions." 
  But the Syrian sources stress that the ones whose intentions 
should be tested are those occupying others' land, "not the 
owners of the rights and land. They (the Israelis) are 
requested to prove their good intentions by complying with the 
complete withdrawal from the occupied Golan, that is, within the 
framework of a comprehensive solution." The sources add that 
Syria's view of a comprehensive solution does not mean that all 
tracks advance "at the same speed. One track may advance more 
than another in terms of time, but the solution must be 
comprehensive in the end." 
  The sources point out that Christopher did not take to Syria 
an Israeli "plan or note," but Israeli ideas about "the Israeli 
view of peace on the Syrian track." And the Syrian side 
submitted "queries and questions" about these proposals, in 
addition to "precise ideas about Syria's view of the peaceful 
solution." The sources say that the Syrian questions focus on 
two basic points: withdrawal and the timetable, saying that the 
Israelis must agree to withdraw completely from the Golan in the 
framework of a comprehensive settlement, provided the withdrawal 
is completed in "a short period," not eight years as announced 
in Tel Aviv. It should be conducted in accordance with the 
"logistic requirements" for this withdrawal, that is in addition 
to the complete dismantling of the settlements. 
  The sources point out that the Syrian demand regarding the 
priority of withdrawal centers on the peace process' essence, 
namely the "land for peace" principle and implementation of 
Resolutions 242 and 338 stipulating "withdrawal" from the 
occupied territory. "Besides, the U.S. initiative did not say 
part of the land in return for peace." The sources add that 
when the Israelis utter the "magic word" (full withdrawal), the 
door would be opened to both sides to discuss "the security 
arrangements." The sources stress that these arrangements must 
be equal on both sides of the border, including the 
establishment of a demilitarized zone and another thinly armed 
[mukhaffafat al-taslih] zone, in addition to electronic early 
warning systems, not just on the Syrian side of the border as 
the Israelis are trying to dictate. 
  The sources point out that the Israeli side is trying to 
"drown the negotiations in a discussion of detailed questions 
like normalization, opening of the border, trade relations, and 
security arrangements, without even beginning to agree to full 
withdrawal" -- which is unacceptable to Syria. This is in the 
knowledge that Syria has emphasized its willingness to address 
these matters, "but after complete withdrawal." 
  As for the "Majdal Shams First" plan, the sources say that 
Syria "is not (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat, and Majdal 
Shams is not Gaza and Jericho." Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
described this plan as "absurd," as Syria rejects any phased 
solution.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: It is public knowledge that Syria will 
settle for nothing short of an Israeli pullout from the entire 
Golan Heights and south Lebanon. Full withdrawal is the 
linchpin of peace. Whoever cares for a just and inclusive peace 
settlement in the Middle East must satisfy the conditions on 
which the peace initiative was launched -- the point of 
reference laid out by the Madrid conference. Since the Madrid 
conference, Israel been shown to be evasive as far as meeting 
the conditions required to establish peace. There is no 
shortage of Israel's evasive tactics: Unabated settlement 
building activity, stepped up repression of Palestinians under 
occupation, population displacements, killings, detentions, 
falsification of facts, and a defamation effort against Syria 
and Lebanon under pretexts that the U.S. Administration and the 
world community know are flimsy. The United States and the 
world community recognize that it is Israel that must take the 
blame for the logjam in the peace process. 
  No fair-minded person anywhere in the world will concur with 
Israel's definition of resistance inside Palestinian land or in 
the Golan Heights and south Lebanon as terrorism. The Israeli 
Government has never passed up an opportunity to dilute the 
Madrid conference formula and the requirements of a just and 
comprehensive peace. To advance that goal, Israel has pursued 
separate deals and abridged solutions, like the Oslo agreement 
and the subsequent Cairo accord, which, in effect, imposed 
Israel's tutelage over the Palestinian Arab people. The 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, hobbled by demeaning constraints and 
deviating from UN Security Council resolutions and the Madrid 
conference that envisaged the removal of occupation and the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian 
soil, undervalues the rights and dignity and future prospects 
for the Palestinian people. It is therefore, not surprising to 
see growing opposition to the agreement in the Palestinian body 
politic. This in itself is a virtual plebiscite on the option 
of separate deals and a reconfirmation of the notion that a 
combination of the Madrid formula and the Security Council 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 is the only game in town for the 
eliminatiion of tension and instability from the region. That 
notion was best summed up by the paper submitted by Syria at the 
sixth round of the Washington peace talks. 
  Things became even clearer at the Geneva summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. It emerged then 
that for a just and inclusive peace to come to the region, 
Israel must pull out from all the occupied territories. That 
much was resiterated by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad 
to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier this 
month. The president impressed on the U.S. secretary the 
urgency of addressing the core issues if the stalled peace 
process is to move forward. 
  The question arises as to whether Christopher's next Middle 
East tour will break new ground. Will he bring Israel around to 
addressing core issues and observing UN resolutions and obliging 
the the international community's will for a just peace in which 
all the interested parties are involved?

  [Text] Cairo, 13 May (MENA)--The Cairo papers, still 
riveted by the Yemeni crisis, write in their commentaries today 
that the situation in Yemen is an Arab catastrophe on a 
dangerous and ugly scale comparable with Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait and the Lebanese civil war. 
  AL-AHRAM says there will be no vanquished and no victor in 
the current war in Yemen. In such senseless wars we all end up 
losing, and badly. The paper calls on all Yemenis to listen to 
reason and seek a negotiated settlement that would save lives as 
well as resources. 
  The paper asks disapprovingly: How can dialogue be scorned 
by brothers at a time when it has been pursued by "sides that 
have known enmity for decades" and whose conflict has been more 
complicated and deep-seated? 
  AL-AHRAM says that there may be a grain of truth in claims 
that the Yemeni crisis is an internal affair. But this crisis 
is undeniably a general Arab and Islamic concern. We cannot be 
indifferent to the events in Yemen, because they constitute a 
painful blow to every Arab and Islamic tradition, the paper 
declares. 
  Writing on the same topic, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that one cause 
of the Yemeni crisis is that some Yemeni leaders tried to fiddle 
with the political balances in a newly united country that still 
lacked the mature political institutions that can withstand 
tinkering. Yemeni leaders, AL-JUMHURIYAH adds, adopted a tribal 
perspective and ditched time-tested procedures and norms. 
  With political acumen obviously lacking, the conflict is 
likely to take on a life of its own, AL-JUMHURIYAH predicts. No 
one in Aden is likely to honor any pledge of unity with those 
who besieged their city and threatened to take it by force. A 
lust for revenge has gripped Sanaa, with many ears deafened by 
the thunder of missiles and the buzz of planes, the paper 
concludes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "Remaining Basic Problems </F>
Left on the Road to Real and Comprehensive Peace in the Middle 
East"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's return 
to the Middle East next week, just two weeks after his last 
visit to the region, indicates that the peace process in the 
region has entered a decisive stage. 
  The start of the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles and the Gaza-Jericho Agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule a few days ago as a result of the efforts made by 
Egypt's political leadership represented by President Husni 
Mubarak emphasizes the need to achieve parallel progress on the 
other tracks in the peace process. The Syrian-Israeli track is 
the most important track and the Lebanese-Israeli track is 
closely linked to it. As for the Jordanian-Israeli track, there 
are no real problems facing it. 
  The U.S. secretary of state is returning to the region to 
try 
to break the deadlock on the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track. 
The track has been deadlocked since the Israeli-Palestinian 
Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington. There is 
not much that can be said about this track. The situation 
requires a major step by Israel. Israel must clearly express 
its acceptance of the principle of full withdrawal from the 
Syrian Golan Heights. The U.S. secretary of state carried new 
Israeli proposals to Damascus during his last tour of the 
region. Reports in the past two days indicate that Syria has 
not rejected these proposals but expressed reservations, as they 
did not explicitly refer to the principle of full withdrawal 
from the occupied Syrian Golan. Other reports have also 
indicated that Syria also has reservations over the timetable 
for withdrawal proposed by Israel. 
  In light of the above it can be said that the Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations hinge on an important step on the part of Israel, 
namely, to clearly express its agreement to withdraw completely 
from Syria's territory. As for Syria, all the reports indicate 
that it is ready to establish full peace with Israel in return 
for full withdrawal and to negotiate an agreement on mutual 
security guarantees without infringing on the rights or basic 
legitimate demands of either of the two parties. 
  There are strong indications that Christopher's next tour 
could break the deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli talks. We do not 
need to reiterate that Egypt is paying full attention to this 
peace track, the attention equalling that paid to the 
Palestinian-Israeli track. 
  The point that must be emphasized here is that while the 
peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track has achieved a 
great breakthrough in solving the Palestinian issue -- the core 
of the conflict between the Arab countries and Israel -- some 
remaining problems on this track are still very complicated. 
The Israeli side has shown some flexibility in its stance on 
the settlements and indicated the possibility of abandoning them 
in the final stages. But its stance on other problems remains 
negative and could, if the intransigence is maintained, 
undermine the entire peace process despite the strenuous efforts 
to date. In this regard, we specifically mention the problems 
of Jerusalem and the refugees. Regarding Jerusalem, no one can 
foresee how things will develop if no agreement is reached on 
this issue that is acceptable to both sides and to all the 
parties concerned with this major issue and its uniqueness. As 
for the refugee problem, Egypt said before the multilateral 
talks refugees committee, which has been meeting in Cairo since 
the day before yesterday, that there will be no peace or 
stability in the region if this problem is not solved. This 
issue is subject to international resolutions that should be 
taken into consideration. Flexibility must be a principal 
element when dealing with this and other major issues during the 
peace process, which remains long, uneven, and fraught with 
dangers. 
  It is an accepted axiom that there is no alternative to 
peace, which continues to represent the future and hopes of all 
the peoples of the region, regardless of their nationalities.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi has affirmed that the government's policy is characterized 
by frankness and openness. He said that what Egypt has so far 
achieved is undeniable. Indications that the suffering has 
started to decrease are emerging and the country has started to 
reap the fruits of economic reform since it has completed the 
larger and more difficult part of it. 
  Dr. Sidqi clarified in statements to AL-AHRAM newspaper to 
be 
published in its issue of tomorrow, Friday, 13 May, that the 
infrastructure in Egypt, on which over 200 billion pounds has 
been spent, is ready and able to provide greater production 
bases for all aspects of Egyptian life. 
  He pointed out that the Egyptian economy grew annually by 
6.2 
percent during the first five-year plan and by 3.9 percent 
during the second five-year plan. Growth is expected increase 
during the third five-year plan to 5.1 percent, while the budget 
deficit will drop to less than 3 percent and inflation to 7 
percent instead of 28 percent. This is something that no one 
was expecting. 
  Regarding the project of a thousand a day, by which the 
government proposed to realize some economic growth and ease the 
burden on the citizens, Dr. Sidqi said that the thousand a day 
project has not dwindled at all, as some parties are claiming. 
He pointed in this regard to international organizations' 
praise for this project. 
  On the revenue from the sale of the public sector companies, 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi told AL-AHRAM that the revenue will be used as 
previously stated by the Government in reforming the structures 
of the public sector companies and in providing liquidity for 
them, which they are in desperate need of. The revenue will 
also be used in modernizing the equipment and developing 
production. At the same time, all this will be supervised by 
the specialized state organs. 
  Regarding democratic practices in Egypt, Dr. Sidqi said that 
freedom of the press, be it the national newspapers or the 
opposition, has gone beyond all expectations. Freedom of 
opinion is guaranteed for every citizen; and the deputies of the 
People's Assembly, both the supporters and opposition, 
interrogate every official about every point, small or major. 
The People's Assembly discussions are open to the public. 
  Dr. Sidqi contemplated the role of the Government in 
alerting 
the upcoming generations and opening the eyes of the youth about 
their religion, saying that this is being taken for granted. He 
stressed that the government does not make light of this matter. 
He clarified that what has happened is not due to the 
Government's failure to perform its duties, but was the result 
of misguidance of a small group under the cover of religion. He 
added that our guiding banner is the book, the Prophet's 
teachings, al-Azhar, and the men of religion who have been 
entrusted with affairs of religion. 
  The prime minister affirmed once again that terrorist groups 
are an alien element in Egypt and a phenomenon from which some 
foreign countries are not absolved, because they have exploited 
some of Egypt's difficulties to plant certain ideas among our 
youths, ideas alien to our religious thinking and our homeland, 
by giving money to these youths. He said awareness and guidance 
are wasted on such people.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has declared that within the next 48 hours details of 
security officials' efforts to apprehend a large group of 
terrorists, numbering more than 20, will be announced. He said 
that these terrorists are the accomplices of terrorist Tal'at 
Yasin Hammam, leader of the Islamic Group's military wing who 
was killed in the Kubri al-Qubbah this month. 
  In press statements today, the interior minister said that 
the announcement was to have been made a few days ago but was 
postponed following the discovery of new angles and important 
information that led to the arrest of more members of this group. 
  He stressed that there is full cooperation between Egypt and 
other countries through bilateral agreements, especially with 
countries where the phenomenon of violence and terrorism has 
appeared. 
  Addressing reports in some opposition papers about the 
lawyer 
who died after being arrested, the interior minister said the 
matter is being investigated by the prosecution office and legal 
measures are being taken. He added: We will announce the truth 
to everybody and nothing will be covered up. 
  In reply to a question on whether the Interior Ministry will 
set up an inquiry committee to investigate the incident, the 
interior minister said: We are investigating every issue that 
is being raised concerning the Interior Ministry. He noted that 
the police are always at the service of the citizens.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 13 May (MENA) -- The first 
Egyptian-Russian trade company for promoting Egyptian exports to 
the Russian and CIS markets has been established with a paid 
capital of $50 million and an issued capital of $200 million. 
  Abu-al-Sa'ud Sultan, head of the Egyptian-Russian trade 
section at the General Federation of Egyptian Trade Chambers, 
said the new company, which belongs to the private sector, will 
work to make a success of barter deals between Egypt and the 
Russian Federation and the CIS, with a population of 300 
million. Most Egyptian companies lost the former Soviet market 
after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  Sultan said the company will work to conclude many trade 
agreements with the Russians to restore part of this important 
market and raise Egyptian exports to their old figure of 1 
billion Egyptian pounds. He noted that current exports to the 
Russian market are 25 percent of the old figure, while Egyptian 
imports from Russia stand at 1 billion pounds. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA)--Industry Minister Dr. Ibrahim 
Fawzi this afternoon attended the signing of a contract on a 
barter deal between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Libyan 
Jamahiriyah amounting to $100 million. This deal provides for 
exports of Egyptian products, including barley, manganese, [word 
indistinct], silicon, aluminum ingots, thermal alloys, cars, 
spare parts, electronic and engineering equipment, and household 
equipment. In return it will import ferrous products, 
reinforced steel, and some other products from Libya. 
  The contract was signed on the Egyptian side by Mr. Muhammad 
Abu-al-'Aynayn, head of the Arab Company for Developing 
International Trade--a joint Libyan-Egyptian company the capital 
of which is 50 million [Egyptian] pounds. The Egyptian side 
contributes 51 percent of the capital. Dr. Miftah 'Azzuz, head 
of the Iron and Steel Union in Libya, signed for the Libyan 
side. He also represents the Libyan Government in the joint 
company. 
  After the signing ceremony, the industry minister stated 
that 
the Libyan iron and steel products will be imported at Egyptian 
market prices in accordance to Egyptian specifications to 
prevent flooding of the market.

  [Excerpts] The good offices by a number of Cabinet members 
and deputies, including Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr, to 
resolve the government crisis were resumed today. Al-Murr today 
visited President al-Hirawi, Chamber Speaker Birri, and Prime 
Minister al-Hariri to establish channels for positive dialogue 
to allow the country to return to normal and proceed with the 
development and reconstruction march. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking after his meeting with Speaker Birri, al-Murr said 
that what is happening is not a crisis as much as a political 
problem to which we seek a solution. He added: Speaker Birri 
plays a major role in finding this solution or helping to find 
one. Noting that certain proposals exist, al-Murr added: We 
hope that these proposals will help us emerge from the crisis. 
  Following his meeting with Birri, al-Murr returned to Prime 
Minister al-Hariri's residence, where he met with him in the 
presence of Minister Walid Junblatt. Earlier, al-Murr visited 
Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. Al-Murr denied any knowledge 
that a Syrian envoy is expected to arrive in Lebanon today or 
that the president, Chamber speaker, and prime minister would 
leave for Syria. He noted that the crisis is on the way to 
being resolved.

<F P=106> [Report by Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, May 13 (AFP)--Economic growth slowed during 
the first quarter of 1994 amid a drop in exports as private and 
public investments stagnated in productivity sectors, a private 
bank report said. 
  Agriculture and industrial exports dropped by 33.2 percent 
and the number of construction permits issued by the authorities 
fell by 15 percent compared with the average quarterly figures 
of 1993, Bank Audi said in the report. 
  Activity at Beirut airport fell 20 percent and there was a 
19.8 percent drop in the number of passengers, it added. 
  The lack of credit offers and high interest rates on the 
Lebanese pound were seen as the main reasons for fewer real 
investments, the report said. 
  Central Bank governor Riyad Salamah meanwhile blamed the 
slow-down on security fears and a wave of political turbulence 
that has gripped Lebanon since a church bombing in February 
killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54 others. 
  The government has since arrested dozens of former Christian 
militiamen, disbanded the Lebanese Forces Christian party and 
placed its chief Samir Ja'ja' behind bars as part of an 
investigation into a 1990 political murder. 
  It has also banned private news and television broadcasts 
until new legislation to regulate the media is drafted and 
approved by parliament, and reactivated the death penalty in 
measures to crackdown on security. 
  The Bank Audi report was released before billionaire Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri decided on Sunday to freeze his 
political functions in protest over opposition for a government 
reshuffle. 
  Al-Hariri's decision has plunged Lebanon into one of its 
worst post-war political crises at a time when it is seeking 
investments to rebuild the infrastructure wrecked by the 
1975-1990 civil war. 
  Lebanon's Central Bank has sold 115 million dollars from its 
reserves since Monday to bolster the Lebanese pound, which came 
under pressure following al-Hariri's decision. 
  Economic experts meanwhile predicted that real investments 
will be kept on hold until the outcome of Arab-Israeli peace 
talks. 
  "Investors are waiting to see the outline of Lebanon's 
economic role after Arab-Israeli peace is achieved," one expert 
said, noting that Beirut's fate depended on the decisions of 
Israel and Syria which deploy troops in Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah </F>
by unidentified WAKALAT AL-ANBA' AL-DUWALIYAH correspondent; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] There is a 
political aspect to the Lebanese Forces' open security file and 
their political line. Do you have any comment? 
  [Nasrallah] We adopted many clear stances immediately after 
the government's measures, with official statements and on other 
occasions. We expressed more than a little satisfaction with 
the security measures taken against the Lebanese Forces. I 
remember it was said at the time that the action to purge 
Lebanon of the Israeli groups should have been taken long ago. 
This is so because the presence of any Israeli political group 
in Lebanon is a threat to Lebanon, its unity, security, and 
stability, and to the coexistence of its various sects and 
factions. 
  We know that the Israeli plan in Lebanon and the region 
seeks 
sedition and division as a prelude to Israel's control of all 
the region's resources. Our view on this is clear. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What is the political picture in view of the 
negotiations? What is wanted is the head of the Resistance as a 
primary condition for ending Israel's occupation of Lebanon. 
  [Nasrallah] We discussed negotiations often. We said we do 
not believe these negotiations will produce results, at least 
not in the foreseeable future. All the optimism that prevailed 
after the Geneva summit between President al-Asad and Clinton 
diminished as the days passed. We even noticed in the past 
weeks that the daily political commentaries carried by Syrian 
newspapers and Damascus radio and television, as well as 
statements by Syrian officials, were very clear in accusing the 
U.S. Administration of abandoning many of its obligations 
undertaken at the Geneva summit. 
  Obviously the United States cannot be an impartial mediator 
in the settlement process. Obviously the Israeli enemy is not 
willing to give even the minimum in convincing concessions to 
the Syrian side. 
  In the negotiating process, there is a very big difference 
between a man like Yasir 'Arafat and one like President al-Asad. 
'Arafat is ready to make concessions unconditionally and he does 
this every day. As for President al-Asad, he is a different 
person. From the beginning he defined and adhered to a series of 
principles despite difficult world and regional pressures and 
circumstances. 
  Israel's intransigence over imposing a truce and settlement 
fully compatible with its conditions and the complete U.S. 
support for and protection of Israel on every level mean that we 
should not expect a result or progress in the foreseeable future. 
  We used to hear statements that a settlement would be 
effected in late 1993. It did not even happen in the spring of 
1994. Every recent U.S. statement has said: "We will work 
toward making some kind of progress on the various tracks in 
1994." This means that the atmosphere is not one of settlement. 
  [Correspondent] Do you expect anything to come out of 
Christopher's current visit? 
  [Nasrallah] He said his visit was routine. 
  [Correspondent] Israel recently attacked Sidon and areas in 
the heart of Lebanon, which was regarded as a message to 
influence the Lebanese Government because its positive stance on 
the Resistance was not firm. 
  [Nasrallah] The government's main responsibility is not only 
to support the Resistance. The Resistance men are often told 
that the official stance supports the Resistance. There is a 
debate now on the theme: "Is resistance to occupation the 
responsibility of the government or the people?" 
  It is the responsibility of the state and the people to 
fight the enemy and drive them away from our country. It is not 
enough for the state to tell the people that they have the right 
to resist. This is a shortcoming of the state. It is incumbent 
upon the state to support the resistance--and not just verbally 
and politically. The state must support the steadfastness of 
the southerners and implement its pledges them. 
  The escalation of the Israeli attacks dictates that the 
Government provide the Resistance with all means to enable it 
deter and prevent these attacks. We should never fear the 
Israeli attacks or allow them to forcibly alter our official 
stand on the Resistance and on steadfastness. 
  The Government's stand on the massacres in al-Nabatiyah and 
Sidon demonstrates its impotence and indifference at times. 
This is a major weak point in the Lebanese Government's 
performance and politics. 
  [Correspondent] Some people believe that the Government's 
support for the southern people should be expressed in a 
political stand or financial support. Are you hopeful that this 
will improve? 
  [Nasrallah] I doubt it. In the past when the south was 
attacked, the Government used to lodge a complaint with the UN 
Security Council. But now it is different: the Government no 
longer lodges any complaints. This means that the Government is 
not giving serious consideration to this. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] It is said that Hizballah is with the regime 
but against the law. 
  [Nasrallah] We may discuss some details, but not the issue 
of 
resistance. We support everything that bolsters peace in 
Lebanon. We are against any show of force. What happened in 
Ba'labakk on Al-Quds Day was exaggerated by the media and 
political bodies, and it was exploited by several parties. 
Nevertheless, it was a hasty action by some brothers, who used 
to celebrate similar occasions with the same way in the past. 
But is had no political connotations. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] How do you coordinate between your 
military-security capability and maintaining domestic peace at a 
time when Islamists in other countries have failed in this? 
While maintaining domestic peace and engaging in quarrels with 
the regime, if political or other developments occur in the 
region and the Resistance's role ends, would you fail to 
maintain domestic peace? 
  [Nasrallah] First I would like to explain one fact. The 
Islamic movements or the Islamists may converge--or naturally 
should converge--in their goals. It is also natural for them to 
have different programs and means to achieve these goals, 
considering the characteristics of each country and society. 
  Lebanon is different from Algeria, Egypt, and many other 
Arab 
countries. Moreover these countries themselves or the Islamic 
countries all have different characteristics; each society has 
its own structure, which the Islamic movement should take into 
consideration. The special characters, circumstances, and 
events do not change the goals, but dictate to the wise man to 
deal with them and take them into consideration in his own 
methods and programs. [passage omitted] 
  We might disagree with the Islamist brothers in Algeria on 
some details concerning this policemen or that soldier. 
Personally I do not believe the allegations that Islamists 
prepare a booby-trapped car here or place an explosive charge 
there to kill civilians, not in Algeria or in Egypt. 
  I accuse the regimes of violence. I read a report in an 
Egyptian opposition newspaper that the baby girl killed in the 
[attempted] assassination of the prime minister some time ago 
was not killed by the explosion but by the bullets of the prime 
minister's guards, but the Islamists were accused of killing the 
girl. 
  In any case, whether in Algeria or in Egypt, it is the 
regime 
which insists on using violence and repression. This regime has 
declared war on the Islamists. So far, the Islamists have not 
been allowed to form legal parties. The regime there [Egypt] 
even prevents the Islamists from carrying out any political 
activity and expressing their opinion. It uses repression 
against them, jails, tortures, and kills them on the streets 
under the cover of the Emergency Law. [passage omitted] 
  As for Lebanon, our military power was established in 1982 
simply on the basis of resisting the occupation--which still 
continues--not to show off or make domestic political gains. 
  The continuing jihad operations over the past years, 
especially in recent years, confirm that we have only used force 
in a real, serious confrontation, and not for propaganda, 
one-upmanship, to show off, or for political gains. The Israeli 
enemy acknowledges that the 1992 operations were more violent 
and fierce than those of 1991. They said the same thing at the 
end of 1993 and, God willing, will say the same at the end of 
1994. Since early 1994, the operations escalated significantly, 
especially recently. Most of the agents killed were not 
ordinary soldiers but security and military leaders working for 
agent Lahd's army. As I said, this is a military power which we 
should not fear. Every one agrees that resistance is a 
legitimate right and duty and anyone who fails to perform this 
duty is neglectful at the religious, national, pan- Arab, moral, 
and humane levels. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What about the party called Hizballah 
Palestine? 
  [Nasrallah] This party no longer exists. There was a group 
of Palestinian mujahidin who called themselves Hizballah 
Palestine for a certain period. But it ceased to exist after a 
short period. Currently, there is no Palestinian group bearing 
this name. But statements are sometimes issued inside Palestine 
by mujahidin who have no organizational affiliation. They might 
use the name due to its morale and jihad value. But there is no 
any organization called Hizballah Palestine. 
  [Correspondent] What is your comment on the Government's 
decision to turn down any request by any party or sect to own 
any information media establishment? 
  [Nasrallah] Generally speaking, we are awaiting the 
Government's laws. The Government must honor its promise and 
present a bill on the audio/visual law. This bill will be 
submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion. We have a 
parliamentary bloc that will participate in this discussion. At 
any rate, the Government can do whatever it wants, but the 
Chamber of Deputies has the final say. We believe that all 
political parties must enjoy freedom, particularly the freedom 
of expression. No sect has its own media. [passage omitted] 
Preventing the parties from expressing their own views 
represents an unjustified violation of freedoms. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Many figures want to join the Cabinet in the 
event of any reshuffle or change. Do you have the same attitude? 
  [Nasrallah] We are not enthusiastic about participating in 
the Cabinet, nor do we have any desire to join the 
establishment. Our participation in the Government is 
contingent on the political program and the extent of the 
Government's honesty and sincerity about implementing a 
persuasive and logical political program that would serve the 
interests of our Lebanese people. 
  [Correspondent] As a rule, the Government is formed first 
and 
then the policy statement is prepared. 
  [Nasrallah] Governments in the advanced countries are 
usually 
formed as a result of alliances and coalitions. As far as I 
know, they agree on a political program and then the government 
is formed. This is followed by the policy statement, which 
normally puts forth a selected political program. Therefore, 
whoever wants to participate just for the sake of participation 
will accept anything.. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that you will not take part 
in 
the event of a cabinet reshuffle? 
  [Nasrallah] I said that this question cannot be answered 
either yes or no. It depends on the program to be implemented 
by the Government. It also depends on the Government's 
seriousness and honesty in implementing this kind of program. 
  [Correspondent] Has any main party in Lebanon been raided 
and 
have weapons been confiscated? 
  [Nasrallah] There are no weapons in the [Southern] Suburb. 
Hizballah fighters have weapons only to fight the Israeli enemy. 
It is logical to distinguish between the Resistance's weapons 
and those used to serve the enemy in some way or another.

<F P=106> [Report by Wajdi al-'Aridi] </F>
  [Text] The country's militias, having been forced to lay 
down their weapons, remained for some time in possession of 
their own media publications, through which they aired their 
news and expressed their positions. 
  With the ban on newscasts and political programs of private 
televisions and radios, the country's parties and political 
organizations are scrambling to revive their old newspapers. 
The move is gathering momentum, with every party busily making 
preparations and looking into the financial side of its press 
endeavor. 
  According to a prominent source of the Progressive Socialist 
Party [PSP], the PSP will soon be publishing a weekly magazine, 
AL-ANBA'. Preparations have been underway since PSP leader 
Walid Junblatt ordered the closure of the party's radio, the 
Voice of the Mountain. AL-ANBA', to be managed by 'Izzat Safi, 
will have political and miscellaneous news reports, mainly 
expressing the PSP line. 
  A similar development is taking place in the Phalangist 
Party. Its political bureau, having passed a decision to resume 
publication of AL-'AMAL newspaper in the near future, is taking 
steps in that direction. Prior to the newscast ban, the 
Phalangist Party had begun tentative transmission of the Voice 
of Lebanon Television, but plans to launch the service have 
since gone by the boards. The party's Voice of Lebanon radio is 
still on the air, abiding by the newscast ban. 
  The Syrian Social Nationalist Party [SSNP] is taking action 
to revive its newspaper AL-BINA', whose publication was 
discontinued two years ago. 
  The Lebanese Communist Party [LCP] has no plans to augment 
its media facilities. In addition to the Voice of the People 
radio, the LCP has a new television station, although it sold a 
large portion of its shares to businessman Tahsin al-Khayyat. 
It is still publishing its magazine AL-NIDA', which used to be 
a weekly but is now daily. Financial considerations have forced 
the LCP to sell part of its media empire. 
  The Amal Movement has no plans to expand its media. It 
currently has a weekly newspaper, AMAL. 
  Hizballah already boasts an impressive assortment of media 
facilities, including al-Manar Television, al-Nur Radio, and the 
weekly newspaper AL-'AHD. 
  The media of the disbanded Lebanese Forces media are up for 
grabs. One eager bidder for the "loot" is the Phalangist Party. 
The latter is suing the Lebanese Forces for control of the 
Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a television station which 
the Phalangist Party claims it owns. The weekly magazine 
AL-MASIRAH, originally published by the Lebanese Forces, still 
appears but prudently avoids any political row with the 
Government. 
  Sources at the National Liberal Party rule out a revival of 
the party magazine AL-AHRAR for financial reasons. The party 
has no other media facility.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi </F>
by unidentified correspondent in Tehran -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] British officials have accused 
the Islamic Republic of Iran of having provided the IRA with 
military and other types of assistance. The responsible 
officials of our country have provided an appropriate response 
to British propaganda. Last night the Iranian president in his 
remarks revealed other examples of British Government 
interference in the domestic affairs of Iran, namely the 
discovery of an spying network [halqeh-ye jasusi] in the Iranian 
Embassy in London. To clarify the details of this issue and to 
receive greater information, we have invited Mr. Mahmud Va'ezi, 
deputy foreign minister for American and European affairs, to 
provide you dear listeners with more information. Before 
starting each part of the interview, we will have a short report 
that our dear colleagues in the political department of the 
first channel have prepared about the background to the latest 
events. Then we will start the interview. [passage omitted] 
  I wish to thank Mr. Va'ezi for taking part in our program 
tonight. We start our discussion by asking Mr. Va'ezi to tell 
us about the details of the event. 
  [Va'ezi] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. 
Before starting to discuss the main topic, I wish to refer 
briefly to the nature of our relations with England during the 
past 15 years; in other words, the period after the Islamic 
revolution. During the past 15 years, we have witnessed many ups 
and downs in our relations. The main reason for it is that, in 
view of its past record in the region and particularly in Iran, 
England finds it difficult to speedily adjust itself and its 
behavior -- its political and propaganda behavior -- with the 
policies we have pursued since the revolution. Indeed, our most 
turbulent [motelatemtarin] foreign relations have been with 
England, compared to any other country. 
  [Correspondent] Let us now turn to the issue our president 
referred to last night, namely the English spying activities 
[jasusi] in our embassy in London. Please let us know how this 
issue started and when did you learn about this spying network 
[halqeh-ye jasusi]. 
  [Va'ezi] Nearly more than two weeks ago, when we were 
carrying out some repairs in the new embassy building, we 
discovered a listening device after pulling down one of the 
walls. It was a relatively powerful listening device placed 
inside the wall. As a result, we did not wish to make an 
immediate judgement or to reveal other issues that might have 
followed from it. When we discovered this, we asked our 
technical experts to investigate the matter further. This was 
about two weeks ago. 
  [Correspondent] You referred to the new embassy building. 
Please tell us what building that is. 
  [Va'ezi] If you recall, at the beginning of the revolution, 
an attack was carried out by opposition groups against the 
building where the Iranian Embassy was situated. As a result 
the building was exploded [as heard] and set on fire. We 
realized afterwards that the attack was led by the British 
security service. 
  [Correspondent] I even heard that the Iraqi intelligence 
network and the British Government were together in that 
incident. Then the building was rebuilt. Apparently that is 
the building you mean? 
  [Va'ezi] That is right. That building was eventually rebuilt 
after a delay. Several months ago its rebuilding came to an end 
and gradually the embassy sections were transferred to the new 
building. It was during the transfer when we came across the 
listening device, which was installed somewhere in a wall in one 
of the rooms in the building. 
  [Correspondent] Why didn't you announce the discovery of the 
device and did not raise the issue in the media at the time? 
  [Va'ezi] The clear reason was that after we discovered the 
listening device, our experts needed to carry out further 
investigation. And security and operational issues required 
time. That was why we wanted all our work to be carried out 
without any propaganda and in good time until yesterday when the 
matter was actually announced. 
  [Correspondent] Did you inform the British authorities 
through diplomatic channels about the discovery of the listening 
device? 
  [Va'ezi] We summoned the British Embassy charge d'affaires. 
The Foreign Ministry director general for Western Europe made a 
strong objection over the action by the British Government and 
asked for further clarification of the matter. 
  [Correspondent] When I was consulting foreign press 
cuttings today, I found a commentary that said apparently as 
soon as the British Government became aware of the cutting off 
of the connection between the listening device and their own 
center, they embarked on a plan for accusing Iran of supporting 
the Irish republicans and made that clamor. Does your 
interpretation and information tally with that or not? 
  [Va'ezi] Of course, because the accusation was a false one 
and was in no way correct. The two can definitely not be 
interconnected from the point of view of their content [as 
heard]. But taking into consideration the coincidence of the 
two actions, it seems that it was a preemptive act by the 
British Government. After the cutting off of their connection 
with the listening device, they made that claim in the press, 
and they embarked on extensive propaganda to cover up the 
scandal they were certain would come to light. 
  [Correspondent] Yes, one of the international news agencies 
had noted -- in corroboration of the Mr. Va'ezi's statement -- 
that the British Government embarked on making up that 
accusation against Iran to create a preemptive atmosphere 
regarding any revelations about the listening device. Please 
tell us what was the reaction of other European countries -- 
which are in your brief -- towards the initial British 
accusation against Iran? 
  [Va'ezi] It is interesting that when the British Government 
announced its accusation against Iran, they said they had been 
coordinating with the rest of the Western Europe states. We 
witnessed that -- with the exception of the American secretary 
of state -- no other state and no other official in any Western 
state showed any reaction. Even in our contacts with Western 
states, we found that that was not an important issue for them, 
or an issue on which any coordination had taken place with them 
beforehand. It seemed that it was a plan carried out by Britain. 
  As you know, Mr. Major's administration is in a very bad 
position at the moment, and from the point of view of 
popularity, it is at its lowest point since his coming to power. 
It seems that through the raising of such issues, they can 
divert public opinion of their own people to a certain extent 
from those problems Britain is going through at the moment. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, the president's statements last 
night were partly concerned with the fact that the media, 
particularly the press, in Britain acted in a totally 
coordinated and guided fashion within the wave of the British 
propaganda against Iran. In your opinion, does that mean that 
the issue was a pre-planned scenario, that they had prepared 
themselves for it beforehand, or do you think otherwise? 
  [Va'ezi] Certainly that was a pre-determined scenario, 
because when they summoned our charge d'affaires in Britain, 
before their discussion had ended, the British radio made an 
announcement. Extensive propaganda had been planned beforehand, 
and they embarked on it. Anyway, all the information at our 
disposal and what has reached us so far indicate that that was a 
planned action. Fortunately with the strong approach of Iran, 
especially the summoning of the charge d'affaires and the fact 
that they had raised an issue that had no truth in it, there was 
no room for any further maneuvers. Anyway the matter subsided 
within a week. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned that preliminary 
investigations 
have been carried out about the listening device and that is why 
the matter has been announced. Is there any information 
regarding its type, form, operation, and use to inform our 
listeners about at this juncture? 
  [Va'ezi] The information we have so far: the device weighs 
about 450 grams. The battery in the device is interesting; that 
is, from a technical point of view the device can operate a 
longer time without being accessed again. The various 
electronic sections in the device indicate that the device can 
have various functions. That is the data we can announce so far. 
Undoubtedly there will be more information we will announce 
later. 
  [Correspondent] We read in the press that apparently the 
device included a microphone and a transmitter. Can you confirm 
that? 
  [Va'ezi] That is so. 
  [Correspondent] The transmitter was next to it? 
  [Va'ezi] They were all together. 
  [Correspondent] Can you give any information about the range 
of the transmitter? 
  [Va'ezi] At the moment our information is not complete 
regarding this particular issue. God willing, later. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, please tell us in what part of 
the embassy the device was installed? Was it a sensitive area 
or not? 
  [Va'ezi] As I said before, we have been making use of the 
new 
embassy building gradually. And taking into account that we had 
taken over from the building contractors, the building needed 
some modification. The modification was in an area we had not 
put to use yet. We wanted to carry out the modifications and 
then use the area. When a wall was demolished we found out the 
fact. When a room or a section is not being utilized, one 
cannot acually talk about its sensitivity. 
  [Correspondent] In fact that was the answer to my next 
question; that is, whether any damage has been done to any data 
within the embassy through the existence of the device. 
  [Va'ezi] We have not made any use of that section of the 
embassy. We were going to make use of it gradually, after the 
repairs we were carrying out. 
  [Correspondent] Have you instigated any investigation on how 
the device was installed in the embassy? Has any one or any 
committee been charged with the investigation? And has the 
contractor been contacted? 
  [Va'ezi] Immediately after the device was found, we began 
our 
activity because we did not want the matter to be revealed at 
the first juncture. Certainly the type of activity we had up to 
yesterday was different. We had made our plans beforehand. 
That is why we shall be continuing our investigations somewhat 
more openly from now on. 
  [Correspondent] The Central News Unit has not yet received 
any report on a formal reaction by the British Government--and, 
particularly, the British Foreign Office--to this issue. Why is 
that, Mr. Va'ezi? 
  [Va'ezi] One reason could be that following Britain's claim 
two weeks ago regarding links between the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's intelligence organization and the IRA, discussions took 
place immediately between British parliamentarians, between 
British officials and their intelligence service and the 
opposition groups that exist in Britain, on the other hand. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean groups in Britain who oppose the 
Islamic Republic of Iran? 
  [Va'ezi] Yes. That is an issue that has worried the British, 
particularly because of its direct effect on public opinion in 
our country because of our people's hatred of such groups. We 
strongly rejected the claim about a link between us and the IRA 
during talks with British authorities both in London and Tehran. 
On the other hand, with the strong evidence that we possessed, 
we raised the issue of their links with Iranian opposition 
groups. That was one reason for that issue becoming defused. 
  The reason they have not reacted thus far is that this issue 
would bring all other previous matters to life, and it seems 
that the British Government does not have a strong hand on that 
issue. That is why it tries to raise new issues to divert 
attention from the case and derail it from its main course. 
  [Correspondent] Do you, in fact, predict that British 
authorities will create new diversionary focal points to 
distract attention away from current discussions? 
  [Va'ezi] That is usually the method they employ. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, what is our next step? We have 
witnessed the discovery of such British networks and bugs in the 
world many times, as evident in the memoirs of their experienced 
spies, including Mr. Peter Wright's "Spy Catcher", in which the 
cases of many other embassies were revealed. Now, this is my 
question: From a diplomatic and official view, what is our next 
step regarding this act by the British Government? 
  [Va'ezi] As you know, we have not had a healthy relationship 
on a suitable scale since the revolution. Our relations with 
Britain have had some problems, most of which were the 
responsibility of the main offender, the British Government. 
The thinking in the British Government goes back to 
pre-revolution ideas. To be more precise: There are factions 
within the ruling circles of the British Government that seek 
tension in relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. If we 
look at the last 15 years of relations between Iran and Britain, 
we see this type of crisis every six to eight months. For this 
reason, relations are not on an acceptable level. We are now 
waiting for an explanation from the British Government. We will 
definitely take other steps after hearing their explanations. 
  [Correspondent] We have seen warnings in some press opinions 
that relations between the two countries will possibly be 
reduced, and new problems will possibly emerge in relations with 
London. Are you of the same opinion, and do you have similar 
expectations? 
  [Va'ezi] Taking into account the information currently 
available and the fact that relations between Iran and Britain 
are not on a friendly and high level, any comment now might be 
too early. We have to wait until all issues are clear. I will, 
therefore, leave this comment for the next opportunity. 
  [Correspondent] During the past week, British officials 
tried 
to reassure their domestic public that they would not have a 
crisis or a reduction in the level of relations with the Islamic 
Republic. They tried to reduce somewhat the initial negative 
climate. Mr. Va'ezi, we discussed the coordinated reaction of 
the press and other British media with the initial government 
action in setting up a propagandistic climate against the 
Islamic Republic. But the information received until now at the 
Central News Bureau of radio and television indicates that only 
two London newspapers have had very short references to this 
news today and have tried not to publish the news on a large 
scale. Does this not mean that there has been no coordination 
on this occasion between the press and the British Government 
and, therefore, the press is waiting for new coordination? 
  [Va'ezi] It seems that the British Government was not 
waiting 
for such speed in what was announced yesterday. They were 
possibly expecting this discussion with us along with the claim 
regarding IRA relations two weeks ago. The fact that this was 
not announced practically foiled the former designs. They were 
not prepared to work on such a subject. They have waited since 
yesterday afternoon because they are waiting for a new 
propaganda policy between the Foreign Office and the press. I 
think beginning tomorrow we will be able to witness a new move 
from the British press and propaganda organizations. [passage

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, who is currently on a 
visit to Gilan Province, attended a gathering of clerics and 
seminarians in Rasht and announced: Thousands of development 
plans are under way in the deprived provinces. We are 
optimistic that one day, the Sistan wildernesses will be 
transformed into a major agricultural pole. 
  He added: When officials initiated the first Five-Year Plan, 
there was much apprehension about its implementation and 
outcome. But today I announce that the plans have been 
implemented and in some cases we are ahead of schedule. 
  The president deemed bitterness and hardship an intrinsic 
part of the reconstruction process in the country and stressed 
the determination of the people to continue on this path firmly 
and resolutely. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated: Most factories and 
industries have reached self-sufficiency in the five years since 
the war ended. This is why the enemies of the revolution raise 
a hue and cry against the country's achievements. 
  He called for the greater presence of the clergy in the 
country's reconstruction. Our colleague at Rasht center reports: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] With the 
conclusion of his schedule for the first day of his visit to 
Gilan Province, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani addressed a 
gathering of Friday and congregational imams, 'ulema, scholars, 
and clerics from all over the province. The gathering was held 
at the Imam Khomeyni prayer ground in Rasht. In his address he 
elaborated on the victorious trend of the Islamic revolution and 
the clergy's mission in the reconstruction era. 
  The president described the difficult conditions of the 
post-war period and said: The enemies imagined that after the 
war ended, we would be unable to reconstruct the damaged areas. 
But now the tools of construction are in our hands and we 
should strive even further for the country's prosperity. 
  Before Hashemi-Rafsanjani's address, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val-Moslemin Ehsanbakhsh, the supreme jurisconsult's deputy in 
Gilan, expressed his appreciation of the Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
government policies and efforts by government organizations to 
rebuild the areas damaged in the 1369 [year beginning 21 March 
1990] earthquake in Gilan. He said: The Gilan clergy enjoys a 
rare cohesion and solidarity. The functioning of 16 Shiite 
seminaries and two Sunni seminaries are evidence of the fervor 
of the people for the manifest religion of Islam. [end

minister's bureau that the Civil Administration will pay the 
Gaza Strip's debt of approximately 37 million shekels to the 
Electricity Corporation. Israel will propose that, in the 
future, the Palestinians make monthly payments of approximately 
6-8 million shekels for their electricity consumption, and if 
they should be unable to pay, the sums will be deducted from 
other budgets earmarked for the autonomy. 
  In the wake of this decision, the Electricity Corporation 
has 
announced that it will not disconnect the power supply to the 
Gaza Strip as planned. This was reported by our correspondents 
Shlomo Raz and Shulamit Schmerling. Under the Israel-PLO 
agreement, the Gaza Strip is to receive electricity from Israel 
on an economic-commercial basis whose details will be finalized 
in negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by Roni Shaqed: "Ready To Die in Jail"] </F>
  [Text] Last week, on the eve of signing the Gaza-Jericho 
First agreement, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres attempted to 
deal with a problem whose solution could grease the wheels of 
the Palestinian autonomy: the release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, 
the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spiritual leader, from 
prison. In statements he made on national radio and television, 
and which reached the shaykh, Peres promised that Israel would 
be willing to free Yasin if he issues a call to stop terrorism. 
  At the same time, Peres summoned Knesset Member Talib 
al-Sani' of the Democratic List for Peace and Equality and asked 
him to contact Yasin. The meeting between the two is expected 
to take place on 8 May, but Yasin's attorney, 'Abd-al-Malik 
Dahamshah, smiles: "He does not have a chance. No person in 
the world could talk the shaykh into accepting a conditional 
release." 
  After five years in prison, the paralyzed and sick shaykh is 
himself a ticking time bomb. Israel would love to rid itself of 
this bomb -- but honorably and for the right price. Peres 
shares the fear of many in the defense establishment that if 
Yasin dies in prison, it might reignite the territories. 
  Yasin's continued imprisonment is a problem for PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat as well. 'Arafat seeks a quiet era to bolster his 
control over Gaza and Jericho. By freeing Yasin, 'Arafat will 
attain two goals: softening the Hamas opposition and proving to 
his people that he is the leader of all Palestinians, including 
his sworn rivals. 
  Yasin, however, despite being paralyzed in the arms and legs 
and suffering from an acute lung disease, continues to thwart 
the plans of his domestic and external enemies. The signing of 
the agreement last week was no holiday for him. He will not 
play into their hands, not even for his freedom. From behind 
the walls, he rejects any offer of a "conditional release:" "I 
will sit in jail until the end of my days. I will neither 
surrender to dictates nor be released under constraints," he 
stated again last week. 
  The Shaykh Yasin problem is a constant headache for the two 
partners to the Cairo agreement. Some time ago, he rejected 
another Peres condition for his release: to meet with 'Arafat 
and mend their relations. Yasin said: "Obviously, I will meet 
with 'Arafat. I do not need mediators for this. But I cannot 
accept such a meeting as a condition!" 
  Shaykh Yasin is incarcerated in the Ashmoret prison in a 
room 
specially planned and built to accommodate his unique situation. 
Because of his physical handicap, two prisoners have been 
assigned to attend to all his needs around the clock ever since 
his detention in May 1989. Up to several months ago, Hamas 
prisoners were those who performed this task with great 
dedication, stemming from their respect for their leader. 
According to Yasin's lawyer, Dahamshah, the makeup of the 
prison's inmates has recently changed, which is also reflected 
in the treatment accorded to Yasin: "Now he is being attended 
by members of the Popular Front, Fatah, and various other 
organizations, who are unwilling to serve him. They are sick 
and tired. After all, the man is completely paralyzed. He must 
be lifted, undressed, washed, and accompanied to the toilet." 
  Yasin's incarceration is not contributing toward moderating 
Hamas' attitude toward the autonomy. Yasin's remarks indicate 
that his opinion of Palestinian self-rule differs from that of 
many of his followers. According to Yasin, there is no problem 
in Hamas' participating in the autonomy institutions, including 
the Palestinian advisory council. He is unwilling, however, to 
participate in its formation and consolidation: "I am not part 
of this; I am part of the Palestinian people. The PLO is 
responsible for this process. I do not consider this a proper 
process leading to peace and tranquillity in our region." 
  Will Hamas people use firearms against their Fatah brethren? 
  Shaykh Yasin unequivocally states that this will not happen. 
Islam absolutely forbids such a thing. Attorney Dahamshah: "The 
shaykh never supported such behavior, did not accept it, and was 
unwilling to follow such a path. He maintains that all problems 
can be solved through peaceful negotiations." 
  Dahamshah adds: "I am familiar with his position regarding 
terrorism. The shaykh never urged his followers to murder 
Jewish civilians -- neither before his incarceration nor 
afterward. You should ask yourself: Why have the Muslim 
organizations acted against soldiers and not civilians? This 
behavior is religiously motivated, and the shaykh has influence 
in this respect. Therefore, it makes no sense to demand that 
Yasin call on his supporters to cease their acts of terrorism, 
seeing that he never called for the murder of people just 
because they are Jews!" 
  The recent closure has not made things easier on the shaykh. 
Gaza residents are not allowed to leave the Strip or to visit 
their imprisoned relatives. Since only those over the age of 60 
are allowed to leave the Strip, only the shaykh's elder brother 
can visit him. 
  The prison authorities award Yasin very special treatment. 
During early April, for example, after he returned his breakfast 
and announced that he was launching a hunger strike to protest 
the fact that a chair and table were removed from his room, all 
the furniture was immediately returned. 
  What interest, if any, does Israel have in Yasin's continued 
incarceration? This question was recently raised in the 
Ministerial Committee on Security Affairs. In addition to 
punishing a leader responsible for serious terror attacks, there 
is also the consideration of keeping some bargaining chips in a 
period of negotiations and in the framework of pressuring Hamas 
to stop terrorism. 
  Shaykh Yasin's associates claim that it is illogical to keep 
him in jail under the pretext that he is responsible for 
murderous attacks: "Terrorism increased only after the shaykh 
was jailed. As long as he pulled the strings from the outside, 
Hamas did not resort to the use of firearms. They settled for 
political protest, disturbances, and strikes." 
  What about the murder of soldiers Avi Sasportas and Ilan 
Sa'adon? 
  Shaykh Yasin continues to claim that the murderers were 
members of the al-Majd and al-Mujahidun organizations rather 
than Hamas. According to Yasin, this is a historical mistake. 
He says that even the charge sheet filed against him states 
that he became aware of the murders only after the event, "and 
even the Shin Bet knows I had nothing to do with it." 
  What the shaykh "forgets" to mention, however, is the fact 
that he was the man who established these two secret 
organizations, which were the precursors of 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam, the Hamas military arm. 
  In his reply to the accusations included in the charge 
sheet, 
Yasin claimed he accepts the principle of peace: "I feel 
religiously obligated to make peace between my people and other 
peoples, because this is God's command." He said that in both 
nations, there are many who refuse to accept this peace. At the 
same time, he emphasizes that he is willing to accept a 
"peaceful solution" which safeguards the legitimate rights of 
his people. 
  In statements meant for outside ears, Yasin is willing to 
say 
that "the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" are 
negotiable: "If you do not want a Muslim state which will 
safeguard everybody's rights (according to Muslim concepts), 
then okay, we will not have such a state. Let us therefore 
establish a state according to the modern concept: a democratic 
state which will elect its institutions under conditions of 
equality and democracy." 
  Today, Shaykh Yasin is considered to be Hamas' spiritual 
leader. In practice, he is more of a symbol than a leader who 
issues operational orders to his men in the field. The movement 
continues to pursue his ideological path. The Hamas leadership 
takes his opinion into consideration, but sometimes Hamas 
spokesmen correct his remarks and "explain" what he meant when 
he said this or that. Time has taken its course, and Hamas has a 
new leadership. Shaykh Yasin is far away and cut off from 
events. 
  So far, Hamas people in Gaza are operating in the spirit of 
Yasin's approach. There is a rapprochement with Fatah, and 
there are some indications that Hamas is slowly being integrated 
into the autonomy institutions. At the same time, 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam's murderers are still active. Gaza fugitives have 
already drifted to the West Bank. Senior security officials 
assess that Hamas terrorism will increase in those West Bank 
areas that will not be under 'Arafat's control. 
  Attorney Dahamshah promises, of course, that Yasin's release 
and return home "will greatly contribute toward calming the 
situation and facilitate the positive process between the two 
nations."

  [Excerpt] The Labor Knesset caucus and the party bureau 
leadership have decided that an in-depth review will be 
necessary to investigate the party's defeat in the Histadrut 
elections, but that no one will be forced to pay a personal 
price. Prime Minister Rabin said a team had been set up to 
conduct coalition negotiations with Hayim Ramon and that the 
return to the party of those who broke away is being considered. 
On this, David Ze'ev: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] The meeting of the Labor caucus and 
bureau lasted four hours. It was highly charged with emotion. 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was angered by the emotional 
statements of some members, who lashed out at the various people 
centrally involved in this crisis. Rabin said personality 
bashing is not what the party needs now. 
  The premier told reporters after the meeting of the 
following 
conclusions: Labor will work to set up a Histadrut coalition 
with Hayim Ramon; it will not sit in the opposition and will not 
try to set up a coalition with the Likud. No beheadings, in 
Rabin's words; Labor Party Secretary General Nisim Zvili will 
not be forced to resign, nor will Hayim Haberfeld be forced to 
leave his post as the head of the Labor faction in the 
Histadrut. A committee to be chaired by Rabin, joined by Zvili, 
Haberfeld, and NA'AMAT women's organization head 'Ofra Friedman, 
will conduct the coalition negotiations with Ramon's party. 
  The prime minister said a proposal is to be considered 
whether to grant amnesty or to call upon those who broke away 
for the Histadrut elections, as well as in the local elections 
last November, to return to the party. Rabin said additional, 
more comprehensive deliberations -- perhaps the establishment of 
a commission -- will be necessary to examine just exactly what 
went wrong. 
  Asked whether in fact he is not so disappointed that Hayim 
Ramon won, Rabin replied: Look, I voted for Labor, I worked for 
the Labor list, but in light of the circumstances, it would have 
been worse if the Likud had won. [passage omitted] [end

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "The Tea Breaks Remain, The </F>
Power Has Gone"] 
  [Text] The Histadrut's Executive Committee might continue 
to take its incessant tea breaks for some time to come, but 
Labor lost power yesterday. It suffered a crushing, painful, 
and humiliating defeat when for the first time in 73 years it 
lost its hegemony over the Histadrut Labor Federation. 
  It could be called "an earthquake," or "an upheaval," but 
Knesset Member Avraham Burg was closer to the mark when he said: 
"We have been screwed." The blow is much more painful because 
Labor brought the downfall upon itself. Just as in 1977 Labor 
under Rabin did not feel the public had grown sick and tired of 
it, and that its loss of power was written on the wall, in 1994 
Labor under Rabin did not read the map properly and lost power a 
second time. 
  Labor old-timers can shed tears over not paying attention to 
Hayim Ramon's prophesy about the mass suicide of the whales. 
The whales are now in their death throes on the beaches, and 
depend on the goodwill of Ramon, Sarid, and Der'i to admit them 
into the Histadrut coalition. [Histadrut forefather] Berl 
Katznelson is now turning in his grave. 
  Ramon's impressive victory, especially since he had only a 
short time to organize, is proof of the desire by voters -- even 
among the Haberfeld supporters, who failed to turn up at the 
polls -- to punish Labor in general, and Labor in the Histadrut 
in particular. The main blow was suffered by the party 
bureaucracy and personally by Rabin and Peres, who permitted it 
to happen. 
  Labor last night talked about "soul searching," and "the 
immediate return of the deportees," but from today on, it is a 
new ball game. Overnight, Ramon jumped from a position of 
asking for favors to one of dictating terms. And in his new 
status, and with lots of allies in his former party, Ramon is 
precipitating Labor into a period of shocks which could end not 
only with the "clearing away" of the entire generation following 
Rabin and Peres, but (perhaps) also end the careers of Rabin and 
Peres themselves. The two can forget about running for top 
office in 1996. 
  Ramon, a product of the system of direct elections and 
telegenic politics, will run against Ehud Baraq and then perhaps 
against Bibi Netanyahu. Now, for the first time there is a 
chance that the young will take over the reins of power before 
old age creeps up on them. Our politics jumped two grades 
yesterday. 
  Ramon's impressive victory provides him with several 
alternatives. The most striking is that he now has the 
infrastructure to set up a new center party with Meretz and part 
of Labor, which one day will be able to set up a young and fresh 
government with a wider-ranging parliamentary base than Rabin 
and Peres managed to achieve in the 20 years they ruled the 
party. 
  There is only one small obstacle in the path opened up to 
Ramon yesterday: He has to be secretary general of the 
Histadrut, fulfill all his promises, deal with a 35 billion 
shekel deficit in the pension funds, cut, sell, defend, close 
down, and what not. If he is made of the right stuff and if he 
shows us he can perform as well as he talks, the sky is the 
limit.

in Jabalyah in the Gaza Strip was wounded in the knee by 
terrorists' gunfire. The soldier was taken to Soroka Hospital 
in Beersheba. Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe 
reports that several shots were fired at the outpost. The 
soldiers returned fire, and then another salvo was fired at 
them. A man suffering gunshot wounds was later found in 
al-Shifa' Hospital in Gaza, and the possibility that he may have 
been one of the terrorists is currently being examined. 
  A truck driver was wounded by gunfire near the settlement of 
Morag in the Qatif Bloc. He was moderately wounded and was 
evacuated to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba.

  [Text] During recent negotiations on the new agreement 
between Israel and the European Union [EU], Israel has been 
encountering difficulties in its attempts to be accepted as an 
associate member to EU research and development plans. 
  According to reports from various European capitals which 
arrived in Jerusalem recently, the talks are being held up 
because Britain has been impeding the talks on approving 
Israel's acceptance to the research and development plans. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin is leaving this morning 
on a four-day visit to Britain, where he will hold discussions 
on promoting the Israel-EU relations and bilateral relations 
with Britain.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sever Plotzker: "Do Not Let Fascism Have Its </F>
Way"] 
  [Excerpts] On 10 May, TV mogul Silvio Berlusconi, the 
newly elected Italian prime minister, presented the composition 
of his government: Berlusconi's popular movement -- which 
organized for the election at the record time of 10 weeks and 
swept most of the Italian voter's support -- is an alliance of 
three parties: Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, a populist 
party seeking to turn Italy into a loose north-south federation; 
the Northern League; and the National Alliance, which contains 
the hardcore Italian neo- fascists. This is the first time 
fascists are members of a European government since 1944. 
[passage omitted] 
  Before it is too late -- before the representation of 
neo-fascists expands, before the new fascists are again accepted 
among the civilized European nations -- my government, the 
Government of Israel, the government of the state of the Jews, 
must take a demonstrative act against what is happening in Italy 
this spring of 1994. 
  We cannot just let this happen. I urge and expect Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to express the Israeli Government's most 
determined protest over the fact that neo-fascists were made 
part of an Italian government. I expect Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres to recall Israel's ambassador in Rome for 
prolonged consultations. I strongly suggest that the membership 
of Italian observers in the Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron be suspended for as long as they are subject to a 
government the deputy prime minister of which is a neo-fascist. 
And, if all the above diplomatic hints do not help, I call on 
my government to downgrade the Israeli representation in Italy 
from the ambassadorial to the consular level, or even less. 
  I am aware of the fact that some Italians might view this as 
an interference with their domestic matters. Not true! 
Legitimizing fascism or neo-post-fascism is no domestic matter 
of any country. It is a virus that could spread like AIDS if it 
is not abolished at once. Even if the Italians are willing to 
stomach their fascists, we, the Jewish government, will scream 
and how. 
  It is not only that we are entitled to do so; it is our 
national duty. This is what the State of Israel is there for. 
We cannot afford to keep silent. We know the dreadful price of 
silence. There is no such thing as humanitarian fascism.

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], stressed the illegitimacy of A'li 
'Abdallah Salih as chairman of the Presidential Council, the 
illegitimacy of [words indistinct] in the Presidential Council, 
the illegitimacy of the speaker of the House of Representatives, 
and the illegitimacy of the Yemeni Reform Alliance group in the 
House of Representatives. 
  At a news conference in Aden yesterday evening, attended by 
representatives of local, Arab, and international press, brother 
'Ali Salim al-Bid explained that legitimacy and constitution 
complement each other. He said that the constitution specifies 
that the Presidential Council will consist of five elected 
members; the five members of the Council should then elect their 
chairman after they have taken the constitutional oath. 
However, that did not happen because al-Bid has not yet taken 
the oath. Therefore, the chairman has been illegally appointed 
and has not been elected by a complete council as the 
constitution specifies. 
  As for 'Abd al-Majid al-Zandani, his membership of the 
Presidential council is illegitimate because he took an oath 
contradictory to the oath specified by the Constitution. The 
same applies to the speaker of the House of Representatives and 
those members of the Yemeni Reform Alliance parliamentary group, 
who took an oath contradictory to the one specified by the 
Constitution. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid condemned the declaration of the 
state of emergency by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, whom he described as 
a dictator. Brother al-Bid pointed out that the Constitution 
specifies that a state of emergency may only be declared 
following a resolution by the National Defense Council, which 
met only once three years ago. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid added that all the resolutions 
adopted by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are illegal because they were 
issued in the name of an illegitimate chairman. He said: 
Legitimacy today is the legitimacy of national unanimity, 
represented by the document of pledge and accord, and we take 
our legitimacy from our people, national unanimity, and the 
higher interests of the homeland and their balance in society. 
  He explained that there are many details which could be 
specified to emphasize the illegitimacy of many of the existing 
institutions. He said: We will soon present [word indistinct] 
our opinion of the legitimacy. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We are approaching the 21st 
century, but there are those who refuse to recognize human 
rights, who try to limit civilian life, and who work toward 
consecrating armament, and pulling us back to the middle ages. 
That is why these people have rejected the course of the 
document of pledge and accord and have imposed this war on us, 
by which they direct strikes and stab at Yemen, its unity, 
people, and national [word indistinct]. 
  In his replies to questions from the correspondents about 
the 
military situation, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the forces of the Al al-Ahmar gang are 
deployed along the past division lines in order to renew the 
secession. He also emphasized that the al-Amaliqah units 
stationed in Abyan did not enter it during the war but were 
stationed in that governorate for four years, where they have 
their own camps. On the other hand, our units deployed in the 
Northern governorates were placed either in the same camps or 
neighboring ones. These camps were hit and destroyed. 
  He pointed out: When we approached unity we did not think of 
the military tactics of attacking it. We entered the union 
peacefully. Our aim is to construct our state in a peaceful and 
democratic way. We believed that the democratic forces and 
civilian life would influence and contain these military forces. 
However, in the end the military forces have disregarded 
everything, usurped freedom, opened detention camps, killed 
women and children, militarized the country, and spread terror 
and terrorism everywhere. This is the proof of their aggressive 
spirit and the inherited mentality of invasion in order to 
spread hegemony and [word indistinct]. 
  The brother secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
reiterated that the aggressive way chosen by the dictator 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his gang will not succeed. He pointed out 
that a new situation has been created among our people, and that 
many units led by the Al al-Ahmar gang have been forced to fight 
their brothers, shell the cities and villages, and to kill and 
shed the blood of the innocent. Therefore, they are working 
toward severing the ties of fraternity, friendship, and unity 
among the sons of the Yemeni people, and they are destroying the 
union with their actions, which stem from a mentality of 
invasion, occupation and looting. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We have exhausted all the 
means of [words indistinct] and accepted all solutions, but 
unfortunately we are today forced to defend ourselves in a war 
which is imposed on us. We consider ourselves (?bound) by the 
document of pledge and accord [words indistinct] this document. 
  He stressed: We stand by all the honorable patriots and all 
the good-intentioned forces in order to build a democratic 
Yemen, as a country on whose basis we agreed unanimously in the 
document of pledge and accord. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on all the soldiers and 
officers, whom the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih throws in the 
fire of death, to resort to reason and patriotism and to abandon 
that unpatriotic and inhuman course. 
  He emphasized loudly: Rest assured that Aden will be 
impregnable to the invaders.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, </F>
speaker of the House of Representatives, chairman of the Higher 
Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and chieftain of the 
Hashid tribes, by Hasin al-Bunyan in Riyadh; date not given] 
  [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of 
the Yemeni House of Representatives, chairman of the Higher 
Committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], and chieftain of 
the Hashid tribes, has described 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice 
president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], as "a mutineer like the secessionist John Garang in 
southern Sudan." 
  He said: "We are not bloodthirsty people, to say that in 
this current war our aim is to demand the head of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. It is our heads that the others want because we insist 
on preserving the unity of the country." 
  [Al-Bunyan] But you insist on occupying Aden. Do you find 
the way to Aden easy? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Who is insisting, and who fabricated and ignited 
the war? And do you think the way to Sanaa is easy? 
  [Al-Bunyan] But how far will you take the war? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Until we destroy the mutiny, prevent secession, 
preserve unity, and frustrate those who are banking on secession. 
  [Al-Bunyan] 'Ali Salim al-Bid says that he was the one who 
worked for and accomplished unity. 
  [Al-Ahmar] No, he evaded Ceausescu's fate and sought unity 
to save himself. So we said to him: Welcome.... After 
submitting his demands to us, which he thought would achieve 
secession for him, he fabricated and triggered the war to 
achieve his objective. 
  [Al-Bunyan] What is his objective? 
  [Al-Ahmar] His objective behind the war is secession because 
he failed to fulfill the old YSP ambition of ruling all Yemen 
their way. Now they want to go back to ruling the southern and 
eastern governorates which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih left under their 
control throughout the transitional period. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid tried to separate the southern 
governorates 
[from the north] in order to revive the secession, ignite the 
current war, and impose his terms which we had accepted for the 
sake of unity. He had insisted on certain demands. When the 
Pledge and Accord Document was achieved, he again brought up his 
secessionist terms. When he failed he fabricated the war and 
resorted to war because he thought that the Arab states and the 
Arab League would intervene to stop the war and then he would be 
able to impose secession. 
  [Al-Bunyan] Would you accept Arab mediation? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We had disagreements before the unity. Why did 
the Arab states not try to send forces then, when we were two 
states? Now we are one state and no force has any right to 
intefere in the affairs of one state. This is an internal 
Yemeni affair. 
  [Al-Bunyan] What are your conditions for stopping the war or 
for the revival of the dialogue with the YSP? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Our condition is that there should be no 
bargaining as far as preservation of unity, constitutional 
legitimacy, and democracy are concerned, and, above all, the 
mutiny must end. 
  [Al-Bunyan] But 'Ali Salim al-Bid rejects 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's decisions dismissing him, al-'Attas, and some ministers. 
  [Al-Ahmar] He rejects them because he is a mutineer like 
John Garang in southern Sudan. We indeed regard him as a rebel 
against constitutional legitimacy. We had elected him as 
Presidential Council member but he cannot act legitimately as 
such and become a member before taking the oath which he and his 
mutineering clique refused to do although the election results 
were supported by the whole world. 
  [Al-Bunyan] Are 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decisions legitimate 
and constitutional? 
  [Al-Ahmar] Of course they are legitimate because he is the 
head of state and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. 
  [Al-Bunyan] And is the head of 'Ali Salim al-Bid now the 
target of this war? 
  [Al-Ahmar] No, we are not bloodthirsty like them. It seems 
to me that it is they who want our heads because we insist on 
preserving unity. 
  [Al-Bunyan] There are conflicting reports about the position 
of the northern forces near Aden. What is the military 
situation now? 
  [Al-Ahmar] That is a matter for the military.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the </F>
House of Representatives and leader of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, by Sulayman al-Nimr in Riyadh on 11 May] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Nimr] Do you believe that 
the regime in Sanaa will continue the war, or will it accept 
mediation and dialogue with 'Ali Salim al-Bid? 
  [Al-Ahmar] It is illogical to hold a dialogue with the gang 
and the rebel leader. However, it is possible to hold a 
dialogue with the Socialist Party as a party and with the 
elements that are not bloodthirsty or rebellious, and with the 
elements that did not drag the country into this situation. In 
the end the Socialist Party is a political party, and we are 
committed to democracy and pluralism. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Nimr] It has been reported that Yemeni Reform Grouping 
elements are fighting alongside northern forces against the 
Socialist Party's forces. 
  [Al-Ahmar] The war is still a military war. No civilians 
are taking part in it. The war is between the state and the 
rebels. 
  [Al-Nimr] Do you believe that tribes could intervene in 
favor of one party? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The tribes have not intervened so far, and we do 
not want them to intervene at all. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Nimr] Do you agree to a cease-fire now? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We did not start the war. 
  [Al-Nimr] If mediation is offered to secure a cease-fire, 
will you accept it? 
  [Al-Ahmar] We will not turn down the mediation of any 
fraternal or friendly state, provided it is based on the fact 
that legitimacy cannot be harmed, democracy and unity cannot be 
harmed, and that the Army is the state's army, so it is 
impermissible for a section or a battalion of it to remain 
rebellious or loyal to any power other than the state.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr </F>
al-'Attas with London MBC TV correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi, in 
Florida; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has 
described the decision to dismiss him as unconstitutional. He 
said in an interview with an MBC correspondent in Florida, 'Aziz 
Fahmi, that the United States is continuing its contacts with 
him. He said the war constitutes a real danger for Yemeni unity. 
  [Al-'Attas] The declaration of war was clearly an act 
harming 
unity and breaking every bond between the sons of the Yemeni 
people. We did not expect our brothers in Sanaa to resort to 
such methods. This is why, as I have already said, they have 
portrayed the situation as an annexation of the south to the 
north. Their behavior shows that they are secessionists. With 
regard to the war, which totally contradicts unity, there can be 
no unity with war. Whatever the situation and whichever side's 
forces occupy the land of the other party, it cannot be seen as 
a victory. 
  [Fahmi] What is the constitutional stance on the 
presidential 
measures to dismiss you and all the southern officials? 
  [Al-'Attas] Undoubtedly, the measures are not 
constitutional. 
It is the right of the House of Representatives under normal 
circumstances to withdraw confidence from the government or from 
any minister. But the Presidential Council has no right to 
dismiss a minister or the prime minister. So this decision is 
not constitutional, even under normal circumstances, never mind 
in the circumstances in Yemen now, which are not normal. 
  [Fahmi] What is the U.S. Administration's stance on events 
in 
Yemen and has it accepted your dismissal as prime minister? 
  [Al-'Attas] We maintain dealings with the U.S. 
Administration 
and are still in contact with the U.S. State Department. In my 
meetings with State Department officials, since the start of the 
crisis they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the 
military course of the political crisis in the country. [end 
recording] 
  Later tonight, a U.S. State Department spokesman clarified 
to 
MBC that his country has adopted no stance on the position of 
al-'Attas, dismissed by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
The U.S. official, who asked to remain anonymous, said that 
Washington is focusing on stopping the acts of aggression 
between the Yemenis and on finding ways for negotiations to be 
held between the north and the south to reach a peaceful 
solution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Is your visit to Cairo in the context 
of the principle of reviving the mediation and ending the 
current war? 
  [Basindwah] I met with President Mubarak and handed him a 
written message from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to reassure 
him about the country's security and safety. I told him that 
what is taking place in Yemen is a case of a mutiny and a coup 
against constitutional legitimacy and that the north never 
sought the military option but it was imposed on us by the 
mutiny command, namely the leader of the Socialist Party [YSP] 
who violated constitutional legitimacy, compelling us to 
confront this and to confront the coup attempt made by him and 
his colleagues with the aim of destroying the country's unity. 
All the Yemeni people are with us, and the mutineers will be 
defeated. We do not want the Yemeni people to continue to bleed 
and pay the price for the losses currently sustained in the 
country. The price must be paid by the YSP leadership. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What is 'Ali Salim al-Bid's position now? 
  [Basindwah] You should ask him, if you can contact him. I 
believe he is now trying to find a place to flee to abroad. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Would the Yemeni leadership deal with him? 
  [Basindwah] We cannot deal with him. He should face a fair 
trial because he dragged Yemen to this tragedy and he must pay 
the price. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But Aden accuses the legitimate leadership in 
Sanaa of declaring war in a speech on 27 April. 
  [Basindwah] The conflict is not between the north and the 
south. It is between the legitimate leadership headed by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, with the people on his side, and 
the mutineers in the YSP leadership. 
  [Abu-Husayn] So, we have to ask you: How will the war end? 
  [Basindwah] There is no civil war at all. What is going on 
is an operation to repulse a rebel group. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Are we to understand that Sanaa is trying to 
enter Aden by resorting to the military option? 
  [Basindwah] That is not true. I am Yemen's foreign minister 
and I tell the truth which is the opposite of what the media is 
saying. We will never fight Aden. We are trying to end a 
mutiny. The mutineers will surrender and flee at any moment and 
calm and stability will be restored. The mutineering group must 
be brought to trial. Thy YSP's history provides evidence that 
it is bloodthirsty and its bloody practices have been going on 
for 30 years. So we certainly must take practical steps to 
settle the clashes, which means that the southern command should 
surrender the forces under its control. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Sanaa will today receive an Arab League 
delegation. What is the mission of that delegation? 
  [Basindwah] The Arab League delegation will not be visiting 
Sanaa for the purpose of mediation. An envoy of Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid was supposed to meet 
with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih before the fighting 
to be briefed on developments. As regards mediation and other 
such matters, everyone knows Sanaa's position on the Arab 
League's meeting and its rejection of any mediation by the 
League or anyone else on the grounds that what is taking place 
in Yemen is an internal mutiny and coup attempt against the 
country's constitutional legitimacy.

  [Text] Doha, 12 May (INA)--Information Minister Hasan 
al-Lawzi today said that the elements who ignited the military 
situation in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] must leave the 
country or stand trial. 
  In a statement over the telephone to the QATARI NEWS AGENCY, 
al-Lawzi said that the opportunity is now open for the limited 
number of elements who ignited the situation to leave the 
country in order to spare the blood of the people and to stop 
destroying the country's resources. 
  He added that there is a chance for these elements, who are 
a 
minority in the YSP, to leave the country so that they will not 
cause any further losses in the southern governorates of Aden 
and Lahij. 
  He continued by saying: If they stay, these elements who are 
involved in the crime of engineering a secession and destroying 
the country must be interrogated and punished for violating the 
constitution and the law. 
  On Wednesday [11 May], President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
announced his willingness to give orders that would allow the 
secessionists to leave Yemen.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, </F>
Yemeni planning and development minister and member of the 
General Committee of the General People's Congress, by Hasin 
al-Bunyan in Riyadh; date not given] 
  [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni planning and 
development minister and member of the General Committee 
(Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress [GPC], has 
declared that "Sanaa will continue the war until the mutiny 
against legitimacy led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid is defeated." 
  He said: "We will continue the war even for 100 years 
because 
we see nothing wrong with fighting in defense of constitutional 
legitimacy, until the mutiny falls." 
  He added: "We know that war is not easy and that the way to 
Aden to put down the mutiny will not be easy but whoever imposed 
that war must pay the price." He emphasized that "the only 
condition for stopping the war is to recognize the legitimate 
constitutional leadership and place all the armed forces under 
the command of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the supreme 
commander of the armed forces." 
  He said that Sanaa absolutely refuses to receive Arab forces 
to disengage the warring forces in Yemen. "We cannot possibly 
allow such interference because we are fighting an internal 
mutiny, fighting to end and put down that mutiny. Do the Arabs 
accept fragmentation of a homeland? Would any Arab country 
accept interference to end a mutiny in it?" 
  He added: "We welcome Arab mediation if it is within the 
context of fulfilling constititonal legitimacy and the context 
of dealing with the state of unity." He also said that 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid's rejection of the legitimate decisions dismissing 
him, al-'Attas, and some ministers is not important because he 
is, after all, a mutineer. He emphasized that the legitimate 
forces will continue the war and the fighting "because we are 
fighting for a cause. A mutineer has no cause. That is the 
difference." 
  Dr. al-Iryani stressed that the northern forces "have not 
retreated one inch on the Abyan front," and that "fighting is 
now raging in al-'Anad base, the last stronghold of the rebel 
forces." He said that the southern forces are now concentrated 
in the area of al-'Alam, north of Aden, considered to be the 
city's first and last line of defense. He confirmed "the 
surrender to the legitimate forces of 550 officers and soldiers 
from al-Labwazah Brigade on the Kirsh front with all their arms 
equipment." Dr. al-Iryani also confirmed "the surrender of the 
southern 30th Brigade three days ago. That brigade no longer 
exists in the Abyan Governorate and al-'Urqub area." He added 
that he contacted Sanaa yesterday and was assured that 
"al-'Amaliqah Brigade has not retreated from its positions in 
Zinjibar and Mudiyah and that it is there in full strength." He 
emphasized that "not a single gun, tank, or piece of arms was 
lost on the Abyan front. These forces are now advancing towards 
al-'Alam area." 
  On the conflicting reports on how close the northern forces 
are to Aden, al-Iryan affirmed that these reports did not come 
from military sources, but he said that forces from Khalid Camp, 
al-Wahdah Brigade, and the 125th Brigade are occupying the area 
of Kharaz west of Aden.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oil Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun by </F>
Shafiq al-Asadi in Abu Dhabi on 11 May] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Asadi] The northerners 
say they have captured al-'Anad base and reached the approaches 
to Aden. 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Al-'Anad has not been captured, nor have 
northern forces reached Dar Sa'd, as 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, and 
Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said. Maybe they 
do not know what is happening on the battlefield. It can be 
said that their claim is absolutely baseless. They must know 
that it is very difficult to reach Aden, perhaps not in their 
time, nor will it be by force. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Asadi] What is your opinion of the decision to dismiss 
you from the cabinet? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] I do not recognize a decision of that kind, 
because those who made it do not enjoy legitimacy. The 
legitimacy collapsed on 27 April after the declaration of war on 
the Yemeni people. Anyone who declares war on his own people 
does not deserve or have any legitimacy. 
  [Al-Asadi] Do you believe there has been Arab interference 
in current events in Yemen? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] I believe that some elements from some Arab 
states are participating alongside northern forces in the 
fighting. It has been stated that there are some Iraqis and 
Sudanese elements on the battlefield. 
  [Al-Asadi] Aden reports said today (Wednesday) that northern 
aircraft are using Sudanese airports to bombard targets in the 
south.... 
  [Bin-Husaynun] The relationship between Khartoum and Sanaa 
and between President 'Umar al-Bashir and 'Abd 'Abdallah Salih 
shows Sudan's support for the northern forces which have 
declared war on the Yemeni people. We regret these matters and 
hope that Arab brothers will not become a party to this 
conflict. If they cannot contribute to resolving the crisis and 
securing a cease-fire, they should stay neutral. 
  [Al-Asadi] What is your interpretation of the north's offer 
of an immediate cease-fire, provided Aden accepts the legitimacy? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] That is up to them. Sometimes they accept 
and other times they do not. But conditions are not conducive 
to a cease-fire. Some say that a cease-fire should be announced 
first, and then a dialogue at the negotiating table should 
begin. For our part, we have decided to accept a cease-fire and 
responded to the appeal made by some brothers. This is because 
of the Socialist Party leadership's keenness to spare Yemeni 
blood, not as a result of weakness. 
  [Al-Asadi] So do you accept the intervention of Arab forces 
to disengage the warring forces? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] Any initiative or effort to stop the 
fighting, return to dialogue, and implement the Pledge and 
Accord Document is acceptable. 
  [Al-Asadi] Including the dispatch of Arab forces to Yemen? 
  [Bin-Husaynun] We are talking about any effort, including 
the intervention of Arab forces. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Informed military sources in Aden have denied 
Sanaa's rumors that its forces today managed to take complete 
control of the al-Dali' area and that they captured a large unit 
of the forces of the Abud Brigade which are concentrated there. 
These sources stated that this is completely false and confirms 
the continuation of battles in that area. The forces of unity, 
democracy, and modernization are waging energetic defensive 
battles against the forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang despite 
the intensity and savagery of the artillery, rocket and air 
attacks on the villages of al-Dali' province. 
  The sources also found it strange that the media of the 
ruling gang in Sanaa continue to talk about besieging Aden and 
that the entry of forces into Aden is subject to a political 
decision. This is (?nonsense) and [word indistinct] that no 
mind belies, nor does logic accept. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Following a fierce battle in which the soldiers of 
the army of unity, democracy, and modernization emerged as 
heroes performing deeds of bravery unprecedented in our people's 
history, our forces succeeded in completely routing the foolish 
and [word indistinct] forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang, 
forcing them to retreat to their rear positions in the direction 
of Qa'tabah. 
  Many members of the latter forces had earlier surrendered 
and 
joined the ranks of our forces, having been forced into the war 
by the al-Ahmar gang by various immoral means. Our forces are 
now in complete control of the entire areas of al-Dali' and 
Shu'ayb, having captured or put to flight the forces of the 
adventurist al-Ahmar gang. In the Bab al-Mandeb Kharaz area, 
our forces succeeded this morning in repulsing the offensive of 
the oppressive forces of the treacherous gang of the al-Ahmar 
clan, forcing them to retreat to their rear positions after 
driving them out of the Ra's al-Arah and the Kahabup center 
areas. Our forces are currently in control of this area, which 
is in the region of the former border existing before the union. 
  The Defense Ministry has expressed conviction that victory 
will soon be won and the destructive and oppressive war declared 
by the so-called 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April 1994 will soon 
be silenced.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "responsible military source" at the </F>
Defense Ministry in Sanaa on 12 May] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: 
  The heroes of our Armed Forces, with support and success 
from 
God, continue to fulfill their valiant missions in the battles 
of confrontation against the forces of rebellion and secession 
on all axes and sectors, inflicting on the deceived forces, 
which are [word indistinct] paid by the secessionist and 
criminal elements in the Socialist Party leadership, heavy 
losses on all axes and sectors. 
  On the al-Tali'-al-'Anad sector, the valiant Armed Forces -- 
supported by the honorable citizens in al-Dali' who stood on the 
side of unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy -- 
managed to cleanse the various pockets in al-Dali' district in 
general. The center of the district, the city of al-Dali', was 
returned to Constitutional legitimacy. The remaining soldiers, 
NCO's, and officers from the 'Abbud Brigade surrendered to the 
forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. Quantities of 
weapons, ammunition, and military equipment, stored in the 
military pockets in this [word indistinct], were seized. 
  Our Armed Forces on the southwestern axis, 
al-'Anad-(?al-Hayla) sector, managed to engage with the forces 
opposing Constitutional legitimacy in parts of the al-'Anad Camp 
fortifications, inflicting heavy losses on various equipment and 
weapons. Our forces on that axis, which were deployed in 
(?Kharad), were able to rearrange their situation to prepare for 
continuing their combat missions. 
  On the Abyan-Aden axis, our valiant Armed Forces were able 
to 
counter the hostile offensives and inflicted heavy losses on the 
troops of the secessionist and rebellious forces, forcing them 
to retreat in defeat. On that axis, our forces seized a number 
of T-62 tanks. The air defense heroes also downed a combat 
aircraft. 
  With a courageous confrontation and high vigilance, the 
Armed 
Forces foiled the futile encircling attempt by units from Taysir 
Brigade and what remained of the al-Wahdah Brigade and the 30th 
Brigade. Our valiant Armed Forces destroyed and seized 21 T-55 
tanks, four BMP armored vehicle, three (?Shilfa) vehicles, three 
14.5 (?systems), two BMP-21 vehicles, and 18 trucks. Our Air 
Force also carried out successful air raids against the 
formations of Taysir Brigade and inflicted heavy losses on it. 
  Our Air Force also carried out air raids against 'Ataq 
airport, Shabwah Governorate. Our planes returned safely to 
base. 
  In general, fatigue is overwhelming all units of the troops 
loyal to the secessionist and criminal elements in the Socialist 
Party. This is apparent in their suicidal, destructive acts 
which cannot be justified by any sound military logic, except by 
the fact that they may believe the fabricated lies that are 
broadcast by the media of the secessionist, renegade gang that 
is hostile to the people, the homeland, unity, and democracy. 
There is a great difference between what is happening in the 
field on all axes and what is announced by those who are hiding 
behind the citizens and the economic, services, and strategic 
installations in Aden. Lies do not live long. 
  Here, we reaffirm our call to all brother officers, NCO's, 
and soldiers in the units that are still under the control of 
the secessionist, rebellious forces. They still can return to 
the trench of right and reject the dictatorial orders they are 
given to fight their suicidal, futile battle. Positions of 
honor and dignity in the Armed Forces, the forces of unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy, await them so that they can join 
their brothers in the Armed Forces and all children of our 
Yemeni people against the enemies of life, the enemies of unity, 
democracy, and the enemies of the march of unity and progress. 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. And 
soon the unjust assailants will know what vicissitudes their 
affair will take.

forces of the unity and democracy. It published reportages 
about the damages caused by the shelling of the residential 
apartments. 
  One of the reportages was written about the calm and 
tranquil 
situation in Dar Sa'd. It was compiled by a press and 
television team which came to Aden to cover the war events. The 
newspaper said in the reportages that one of the correspondents 
talked to the soldiers who were guarding the gates of al-Anad 
camp. The journalist described the stable conditions in this 
region thanks to the armed forces of the country and democracy 
which are controlling in the battlefield [sentence as heard]. 
  The journalist wondered about the lying information which 
falsifies the facts and confuses the people and [words 
indistinct]. He said: Such media deserve to be described as 
lying media, because it presents false information about the 
situation. He said: All information we have heard from the 
Sanaa media to the effect that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's forces had 
captured al-Dali' is untrue.

  [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning in an 
ordinary session chaired by brother Muhammad al-Khadim al-Wajih, 
a member of the office of the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. After reviewing and ratifying the minutes of 
the previous session, the House conducted a lengthy and 
responsible discussion of conditions in our country. The House 
issued the following statements: 
  Thanks be to God, whose blessing we beseech in calamity, and 
who says in the Holy Koran: All believers are brothers; and who 
also says: There is the type of man whose speech about this 
world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness about 
what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. 
When he turns his back his aim everywhere is to spread mischief 
throughout the Earth and destroy crops and cattle, but God 
loveth not mischief. [Koranic verse] 
  In its Wednesday, 11 May 1994 session, the House of 
Representatives discussed the ugly crime committed by Socialist 
Party outlaws who used long-range missiles to strike civilian 
targets, murdering and terrorizing women, children, the elderly, 
and the disabled who were asleep in their homes. These 
missiles, paid for with the food and sweat of our people, struck 
them and tore apart their bodies. They had committed no crime, 
except for their love of unity and their support of 
Constitutional legitimacy and political pluralism, yet they were 
murdered. 
  In the light of this, the House decided the following: 
  1. To strongly condemn this crime committed by Socialist 
Party outlaws and to hold the perpetrators completely 
responsibile. The crime reveals the extent of the hatred 
harbored by these criminals and the scope of their terrorist 
acts against the Yemeni people. They want to achieve their 
selfish interests by killing the innocent and destroying the 
people's structures and achievements in unity, democracy, and 
peace. 
  2. The House considers these crimes to violate Islamic 
values and teachings, as well as international and humanitarian 
norms that forbid the murder of the elderly, women, children, 
and the disabled. These savage acts are ugly war crimes and high 
treason directed against God and the homeland. Its perpetrators 
deserve the severest punishment. 
  3. The House urges all members and segments of society, its 
political forces and its popular organizations to denounce and 
condemn these ugly crimes and to defend unity, democracy, 
pluralism, and Constitutional legitimacy, which guarantee the 
security and stability of Yemen and its people. The House urges 
the Arab, Muslim, and world public opinion and all international 
organizations and honorable forces concerned with the defense of 
human rights to denounce and condemn these crimes. 
  4. The executive power must take all necessary legal and 
Constitutional steps to deter these murderers and bring them to 
justice and to apply the necessary legal, and deterrent 
punishment against them. 
  5. The House urges the government to take the steps 
necessary to provide full care for the families of the victims 
of the Scud missiles and to consider these victims martyrs of 
unity, democracy, and legitimacy. 
  The House stresses that Yemen and its unity, which was 
built by the blood and sweat of its people, is invulnerable to 
enemies and will remain an illuminating torch protecting 
national, pan-Arab, and Islamic security. It stresses that 
victory will, God willing, be for unity and unionists. 
  The House urges unionists in the Socialist Party, both the 
civilian and military, to support Constitutional legitimacy and 
reject these criminal acts. 
  The mercy of God be upon our pure martyr. God spare our 
country any evil. From God we seek support. 
  The Republic of Yemen's House of Representatives noted the 
responsible and sincere positions taken by some Arab parliaments 
that support Yemeni unity, which was achieved thanks to God 
almighty and the Yemeni people's long struggle, and which is 
considered a candle lighting the path of Arab and Muslim unity. 
  The House highly praises the position of the House of 
Representatives in fraternal Jordan, as well as the other Arab 
parliaments, and the sincere statements they issued in support 
of Yemeni unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which the 
advocates of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party's 
leadership tried to violate in an attempt to push the country 
into the furnace of a destructive and all-out war on all levels. 
  Since the start of the crisis fabricated by that gang, who 
are violating Constitutional legitimacy, the House has been 
stressing the need to preserve the achievements of unity and 
democracy in Yemen. It considers them achievements of the Arab 
and Muslim nations. The House, therefore, urges Arab 
parliaments and regional and international organizations to 
denounce and condemn the use by the secessionist gang of the 
Socialist Party of weapons of mass destruction against civilians 
in certain Yemeni cities, including the capital of Yemeni unity, 
Sanaa, and Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah. 
  The House appeals to fraternal and friendly parliaments and 
regional and international organizations to motivate their 
governments and media to adjust the way they view the events in 
the Yemeni arena. This must be seen as an internal affair 
between Constitutional legitimacy and the rebellious gang, and 
not a war between north and south, as some people, intentionally 
or unintentionally, are saying. 
  We beseech God to protect our country from any evil and 
protect all of our Arab and Muslim countries from any harm. We

<F P=106> ["Statement" issued by the General Committee of the General </F>
People's Congress in Sanaa on 12 May] 
  [Text] Masses of our Yemeni people: The serious historic 
and national challenge facing the unity requires all of us and 
all of the homeland's well-intentioned unionist forces and the 
masses of our Yemeni people in all sectors to confront the grave 
conspiracies. These conspiracies are led by the forces of 
apostasy and secession from among the leaders of the Socialist 
Party against unity and constitutional legitimacy and against 
the people and their will, as expressed on 27 April 1993. 
  Defending this land is defending the honor and dignity of 
this homeland, its independence, sovereignty, and national, 
democratic regime. This is being done today by our Armed 
Forces, the forces that protect constitutional legitimacy and 
democracy, on all battlefields. This is also being done by the 
masses confronting the forces of apostasy, treason, and 
secession led by the leaders of the Socialist Party, who have 
for nine months -- since 19 August -- been maneuvering under 
various contradictory and misleading pretexts in the hope of 
buying more time to prepare for achieving their objective of 
secession, planned by the gang of apostasy and treason, led by 
the butcher 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-Bid has savored maneuvering. 
He also wants to satisfy his lust to serve the objectives of 
his masters, who plot against and betray the homeland to 
slaughter its unity. 
  The best evidence of this is the firing of destructive Scud 
missiles against defenseless citizens in the cities of Sanaa, 
Ta'izz, al-Rahidah, and other cities by the gang of criminality, 
apostasy, and secession. This claimed the lives of many 
victims, including women, children, and elderly people, and 
terrorized defenseless citizens in their homes and cities. 
  The criminal, cowardly actions of the forces of apostasy and 
secession represent terrorist, savage, and brazen actions and 
reflect a vindictive Nazi [as heard] sentiment and destructive, 
adventurist mentality that has ignited the fire of sedition all 
over the homeland. Thus, they started firing missiles 
indiscriminately at cities and secure residential quarters in 
Sanaa, Ta'izz, and other Yemeni cities. 
  The General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC] 
shares with the masses of our people their pain over these 
inhuman, immoral crimes. The General Committee strongly 
denounces these criminal, savage acts that are carried out by 
the gang of apostasy, secession, and treason in the Socialist 
Party leadership. It appeals to public opinion, political 
forces, parties, and organizations and national unions, 
societies, and figures to adopt a clear, frank, and responsible 
position by denouncing these reckless, criminal acts carried out 
by the gang of destruction, death, treason, rebellion, and 
terrorism in the Socialist Party leadership. 
  The General Committee of the GPC urges the sons of our 
people to stand firmly by the side of the Armed Forces, the 
forces of unity and legitimacy that are storming the dens of 
treason and apostasy and secession. It calls on the masses of 
our Yemeni people to demonstrate even greater unionist cohesion 
to face this secessionist gang and oppose its criminal actions 
and misleading propaganda. 
  The General Committee of the GPC also urges the members of 
the Armed Forces, including officers and troops who were misled 
by the leadership of apostasy and secession in the Socialist 
Party leadership, to side with legitimacy, defend unity and 
democracy, and respect the national principles of society. 
  The General Committee also appeals to all unionist forces in 
political parties, organizations, unions and associations, 
particularly the unionist elements within the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, to spell out their position toward this gang and the 
destructive results of its actions on the homeland, society, and 
national unity. The homeland is paramount to everyone and is 
the property of all; the responsibility of protecting it from 
destruction and sabotage, along with its achievements and 
projects over three decades, is the responsibility of all 
citizens, regardless of their political persuasion. 
  The reckless, criminal acts carried out by the spiteful, 
secessionist gang, as well as its hysterical, stupid, 
irresponsible acts, will only increase our people's 
determination to go ahead and make more achievements for unity 
and constitutional legitimacy and to provide security and 
stability all over the homeland. 
  The General Committee reasserts what was said by the brother 
chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of 
the GPC, in his speech yesterday: We are not against the 
Socialist Party but against the separatist, apostate elements 
within the Socialist Party leadership that are waging a losing 
war and shedding innocent blood. The unionists in the Socialist 
Party should spell out their position clearly toward this 
criminal gang and should rally around unity and constitutional 
legitimacy and reject the decisions of the secessionist gang 
that declared war. They should spell out their position for the 
sake of bridling war and ending more bloodshed. 
  The General Committee of the GPC also stresses what was said 
by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and 
secretary general of the GPC: We reject war in all its aspects 
and forms and do not want to have a victor or vanquished. The 
war was imposed on us. We are fighting so that the will of the 
people for security, stability, and social peace will triumph 
and bring constitutional legitimacy. 
  The General Committee of the GPC holds the criminal al-Bid 
and his treasonous gang that conspired against the homeland, 
democracy, and constitutional legitimacy fully responsible and 
asserts that the shelling of residential quarters in Sanaa, 
Ta'izz, al-Rahidah, and other cities will not go unpunished. 
Our people will take to task all those adventurers and traitors 
who have departed from the ranks of the people, its unionist 
will, and democracy. 
  And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes 
their affair will take. [Koranic verse] 
  Issued by the General Committee of the GPC

  [Text] A responsible source in the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
has expressed denunciation and condemnation of the grotesque 
crimes perpetrated by the secessionists in the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] and their use of internationally banned missiles 
which they directed at heavily populated residential areas 
inhabited by unarmed citizens. The latest of these missile is 
the one fired at Sanaa area on Wednesday which killed 23 martyrs 
and injured 30 others. 
  The source added that this heinous crime demonstrates the 
sick minds of the YSP secessionists, the continuing bloody 
policy by which they have been known throughout their rule, and 
the oppression of our brothers in the southern and eastern 
governorates. This suicidal action demonstrates the level of 
despair of the YSP secessionists and their state of collapse. 
  Concluding its statement, the source said that such criminal 
acts, which are not justified by any religious, conventional, or 
moral standard, cannot pass unpunished. We appeal to all 
citizens to keep calm and not to worry as a result of these 
actions, despite their ugliness. We ask citizens to make these 
actions a motive for further cohesion and unity among all. We 
pray to God to steer the country and Yemeni people everywhere 
away from harm and afflictions and to have mercy on the souls of 
the martyrs and speed the recovery of the injured. 
  God is our supporter.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F>
Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa, Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus, and 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureau in Aden: "Socialist Party Deputies 
Hold Session in Aden"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa and Aden yesterday intensified their Arab 
contacts in an attempt to explain their positions in the war in 
Yemen, in a race with the actual fighting in which armor, 
aircraft, and missiles are being used to create a fait accompli 
on the ground that would help either of the two sides to settle 
the conflict in its favor by political or military means while 
keeping Arab channels of contact open. 
  Meanwhile, the deputies of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
in the House of Representatives and a number of independent 
figures have decided to hold a meeting in Aden today. [passage 
omitted] 
  All this is taking place while each side is accusing the 
other of enlisting the help of foreign powers. Sanaa sources 
have stated that "an Arab state that is not a neighboring state 
has provided facilities at its airports for the southern air 
forces." Aden, on the other hand, has accused Eritrea of 
placing its airports at the disposal of the northern command and 
claimed that two ships have arrived at al-Hudaydah port loaded 
with Iraqi arms from Port Sudan. 
  According to YSP sources, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Akwa', President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's brother-in-law, or Ahmad al-Hajari may 
have arrived in Baghdad via Jordan in the company of someone by 
the name of al-Khawlani, to request additional arms (missiles 
and planes) which are now in Sudan having been taken there 
during the Gulf war. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Issues and Events" </F>
program] 
  [Excerpt] The firing of missiles by the gang of secession 
and apostasy on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz has no 
worthwhile result but to claim the lives of innocent people and 
terrorize defenseless citizens. Those who are perpetrating this 
criminal act know long-range missile attacks will never affect 
the current military situation or the outcome of the military 
operations raging only a few kilometers from Aden, where the 
gang of secession and apostasy is standing in trenches. The 
only option for this gang is to surrender, leave the homeland 
and enjoy the public funds it has looted, or commit suicide. 
  Despite the fact that the missiles have harmed a number of 
citizens, martyring some of them in the capital, Sanaa, and in 
the city of Ta'izz, they have not adversely affected the psyche 
of the forces struggling to protect unity and defend 
constitutional legitimacy. This is because the forces of unity 
have a human and geographic depth, thus making them more 
steadfast and stronger. Moreover, all members of these forces 
enjoy resolve and unwavering faith in victory. 
  We say without exaggeration that the cowardly missile 
attacks 
on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz will only increase the 
determination of the sons of our proud Armed Forces to move 
forward until they arrest the rebellious gang of apostasy and 
secession. These forces are struggling for unity and for 
defending Constitutional legitimacy. The people's sons are 
waiting to hold this gang to account for what it deserves for 
the crimes it has committed against the people and their 
resources. 
  The missile attacks on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz 
have 
revealed both the impotence and the grudge of the gang of 
apostasy and secession. This gang knows well that these 
missiles cannot affect the course and results of the military 
operations whose theaters have approached the outskirts of Aden.

  [Text] O sons of our lofty Yemeni people: The forces of 
apostasy and secessionism know that their dens and houses in 
beloved Aden are only a stone's throw from the rifles of the 
forces of unity and legitimacy. However, the unity forces's 
concern and ethical and religious commitments make them 
dutybound to safeguard the lives of innocent people. The 
grudges and bloody whims of these secessionist forces as well as 
their Communist missiles will make our people and army of unity 
and legitimacy more concerned about our fathers, mothers, and 
sons in beloved Aden, al-Dali', and other areas. 
  Therefore, we would like to reassure our people in beloved 
Aden and in other areas that the army of unity and legitimacy 
does not harbor grudges or seek liquidation. This army will put 
before everything the welfare of all fathers, mothers, and 
defenseless children wherever they are in Yemen. Their unity 
army, which fully abides by the values of Islam, will only 
behead, with its iron hand, the separatists who tampered with 
Aden and with all (?lofty) southern governorates and their good 
people for approximately 30 years. It is a blessed advance 
toward a new Yemen which is free of secessionist butchers, God 
willing. 
  We only ask that our brother citizens in the beloved 
Governorates of Aden and Lahij remain calm, do not cooperate 
with the gang of apostasy and separation, and do not respond to 
their separatists.

  [Text] Damascus, 12 May (MENA) -- Former President 'Ali 
Nasir Muhammad has affirmed that the road to understanding, 
dialogue, and national reconciliation in Yemen is not closed yet 
in spite of the ferocity of the ongoing battles. 
  In an interview with a MENA correspondent in Damascus, 
Muhammad said that he put forward an initiative to resolve the 
Yemeni crisis and that he is consulting about it with some 
personalities who are not involved in the current dispute. 
  He added that if these personalities and the parties to the 
dispute respond to this initiative, he is willing to go with 
these personalities to Sanaa or Aden to stop the bloodletting 
and save unity. 
  He stressed that any efforts, suggested solutions, or 
initiatives to resolve the Yemeni crisis must be based on the 
principle of safeguarding the Yemeni unity, not on returning to 
the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990. 
  The former Yemeni president pointed out that he had 
presented 
several initiatives last year and this year and that he warned 
earlier against turning conflicts among the members of the 
ruling coalition into the funeral pyre of unity. 
  He regretted what is going on in Yemen, reaffirming his 
backing for every effort to safeguard unity and resolve the 
conflict through dialogue and peaceful methods. He noted that 
what is happening at present does not help the two sides to have 
a peaceful dialogue. 
  Commenting on the appointment of a defense minister and a 
navy commander from among his old loyalists, he remarked that 
his loyalists who went to Sanaa with him after the January 1986 
incidents were divided between the General People's Congress and 
the Yemeni Socialist Party, after these two partners had 
(?aborted) the setting up of a democratic unionist party during 
the honeymoon that preceded unity. He pointed out that this was 
the choice of his loyalists and that it was not planned. 
  Muhammad affirmed that appointments to party and government 
posts are according to the prevailing political rules and that 
he has nothing whatsoever to do with these appointments. He 
remarked that accepting an appointment is the personal choice of 
the person selected for a post.

  [Text] The Philippine overseas contract workers [OCW's] 
trapped in Yemen have been waiting for five days to be 
repatriated to the Philippines. In an interview with GMA Radio, 
a Philippine OCW identified as Josie Oliva said they have been 
advised to return home immediately. According to Oliva, she and 
30 other OCW's are safe and are staying at the Sheraton Hotel. 
She fears that if they are unable to leave today, their lives 
may be in danger. 
  In this connection, the Department of Foreign Affairs has 
revealed that two C-130 planes from the Philippine Air Force are 
set to fly to Yemen to retrieve the Phlippine OCW's once a 
landing permit is secured. 
  [Begin Oliva recording, in progress] ...as of now we are 
safe; we have not yet been affected in any way. But we do not 
know about tomorrow; we do not know what will happen tomorrow. 
They have already advised us to get out because we are the only 
ones left here. As I mentioned before, all other nationals have 
been rescued by their respective governments. Only the 
Philippine Government has not acted. We are still okay, 
including my brother and my uncle, but we do not have any 
outside contact. We cannot communicate because there is no 
international line available here. [end recording]

  [Text] A Palestinian police force crossed the Jordan River 
today to take control of the Jericho area on the West Bank, thus 
marking the end of 27 years of Israeli occupation. The first 
regiment was made up of 20 police; the rest will follow. 
  From King Husayn bridge, our correspondent Yusuf Faraj 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Faraj] At 1300 today, a 20-man advance 
party of the Palestinian National Security Forces crossed King 
Husayn Bridge to Jericho on Palestinian territory, following a 
five-day wait at a point close to the bridge. The crossing 
followed talks between top Palestinian and Israeli negotiators. 
The regiment will take up position at points already agreed to 
by the sides. 
  [Jamil Tarifi, head of the Palestinian side to the Liaison 
Committee with Israel] The first regiment will conduct joint 
patrols with the Israelis in the Jericho area. 
  [Faraj] And the second regiment? 
  [Tarifi] The second regiment is scheduled to travel straight 
to Gaza today to undertake security responsibilities in 
conjunction with forces that crossed via the Rafah border point. 
The forces due to cross tomorrow will handle security duties in 
Jericho. We are slated to take over all civilian duties in 
Jericho. 
  [Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian 
Security Forces] God willing, tomorrow will see us in complete 
control over the southern region from the Gaza Valley in the 
north to Rafah in the south. Then we will have control over the 
northern part of Gaza, which, God willing, will be completed 
next Wednesday [18 May]. 
  [Faraj] How do you feel on this occasion? 
  [Yusuf] I am gripped by unusual feelings. The sight of our 
kinsfolk celebrating is unbelievable. It is a historic, 
unusual, special day. On this occasion, we thank our brothers 
here in Jordan for the training facilities they made available 
to us. We are particularly grateful to his majesty the king, 
who yesterday visited and inspected the units and extended 
further moral and material support. This country is ours and 
its people our kinsfolk. We have always been family, and we 
share a common future, God willing. [end recording]

  [Text] The transfer of authorities to the Palestinians in 
Jericho has begun. Foreign correspondents report from the town 
that approximately two hours ago, Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, 
the head of the Civil Administration, turned the administration 
building over to 12 Palestinian policemen. The policemen were 
also given the police station. The Palestinians hastened to fly 
a Palestinian flag from the building. Correspondents report 
that local residents were surprised that the ceremony was held 
earlier than they had expected. In approximately one hour, the 
Palestinians will also receive control of the Hanan base, which 
was used until now by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The 
Palestinian al-Aqsa brigade will now operate from the base. 
  According to reports from Amman, hundreds of soldiers from 
the brigade are currently making their way to the Allenby 
bridge. If everything goes according to plan, they will enter 
the Jericho area sometime today. The Palestinians are also 
slated to receive control over the area of the ancient Shalom 
'Al Yisra'el synagogue in Jericho today. 
  The transfer of authorities to the Palestinians also 
continued in the Gaza Strip. Our Army affairs correspondent 
Karmela Menashe reports that last night, the IDF turned over 
army, police, and Border Police installations to Palestinian 
policemen. A convoy of 300 Palestinian policemen is now making 
its way to the Gaza Strip after crossing the Allenby Bridge last 
night. The convoy is currently on its way to Rafah and it is 
accompanied by Israeli security forces. 
  Brigadier General Doron Almog, the commander of IDF forces 
in 
the Gaza Strip, said that the number of shooting incidents in 
the Gaza Strip had declined recently. Brig. Gen. Almog asserted 
that this was due to an agreement between Fatah and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] designed to prevent any delays in 
the IDF's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT reports that "as 
of 
0400 [0100 GMT] this morning, Khan Yunus and all the rest of the 
southern part of the Gaza Strip are in Palestinian hands. 
During the night, the headquarters of the Khan Yunus brigade, 
the Khan Yunus Civil Administration offices, and the Border 
Police base were completely evacuated. A short time afterwards, 
at 0335 [0035 GMT] a vehicle carrying about 30 Palestinian 
policemen arrived, accompanied by Israeli security forces. The 
policemen, who arrived with weapons, were given ammunition and 
immediately toured the installations being turned over to them." 
The report goes on to note that "up till now, six installations 
have been turned over to the Palestinians. As of 0400 this 
morning, Khan Yunus and all the southern part of the Gaza Strip 
are controlled by the Palestinian police and approximately two 
thirds of the residents of the Gaza Strip are no longer under 
IDF control."] 
  [Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 13 May in a page 1 report by On 
Levi and Mikhal Sela' states that "defense establishment sources 
have expressed fears that Palestinian fugitives and armed 
terrorists from Judaea and Samaria may flee to the Jericho area 
and use it as a refuge. At the General Staff, discussions were 
held on the need to increase the supervision of people entering 
and leaving the Jericho area along the main traffic axes and 
bypass roads, especially in light of the fact that contrary to 
the Gaza Strip, no fence will be established around Jericho." 
The report notes that "IDF sources have expressed the 
assessment that terrorist activity against soldiers and Israeli 
civilians will increase in the areas that are not under 
Palestinian control. The sources believe that these attacks 
will be carried out by the rejectionist groups, including Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad."]

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 12 May (MENA)--Ambassador 'Uthman Ahmad 
'Uthman, head of the Egyptian delegation to the meetings of the 
Refugee Affairs Committee stemming from the multilateral talks, 
has stated that several countries have decided to give financial 
assistance to the tune of $50 million to the Palestinian 
refugees. He said that this assistance is designed to improve 
the refugees' standard of living. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, Ambassador Ahmad 'Uthman 
said that the Refugee Affairs Committee has prepared a report on 
the condition of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, 
who thought they were excluded from the peace process. He noted 
that a special committee had inspected their living, economic, 
and social conditions and submitted a report to the Refugee 
Committee. Accordingly, several countries decided to give 
financial assistance to improve the conditions of the 
Palestinian refugees who live outside the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
  In his statement, Ambassador 'Uthman said that other 
countries had also decided to give technical assistance and to 
finance economic projects to improve the conditions of the 
refugees inside and outside the occupied territories without 
harming their political rights, including their right to return. 
He affirmed that the philosophy of the Refugee Affairs 
Committee is to promote the refugees' living conditions until a 
final solution to their problem is reached. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Ilyas [name indistinct], head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Refugee Affairs Committee, said that the 
Palestinian delegation has demanded that all the UN resolutions 
pertaining to the Palestinian issue be implemented and be a 
basis form the authority of the Committee. The Palestinian 
delegation noted that there should be no contradiction between 
the Refugee Affairs Committee's work and the refugees' political 
rights and future status, he said. 
  The head of the Palestinian delegation said that working out 
a final solution to the refugee's problem will be dealt with 
within the context of Palestinian-Israeli political 
negotiations, slated to be held at the start of the third year 
of Palestinian autonomy. He said there are six million 
Palestinians, and those include three million refugees who are 
seeking to return to the homeland.

  [Text] Salih Abu-Bakr Bin Husaynun, Yemeni oil minister and 
special envoy of Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
arrived in Damascus today accompanied by a delegation. He was 
received at Damascus International Airport by Dr. Nadir Nabulsi, 
minister of Oil and mineral resources, senior officials from the 
Foreign Ministry and the Oil and Mineral Resources Ministry, and 
the Yemeni ambassador in Damascus and the embassy staff. 
  In a statement to SANA, Bin-Husaynun said the aim of the 
visit is to hand a letter to President Hafiz al-Asad from his 
brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary 
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, dealing with Yemeni 
developments especially after the outbreak of war in Yemen. 
Bin-Husaynun praised Syria's stands and its concern for Yemen. 
He said: We are aware that Syria is pained by the ongoing 
fighting between Yemeni brothers. It stands by Yemen in this 
affliction. This is not a novelty, because Syria has always 
shared the pain and always stood by any Arab state facing 
threats.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- President Mubarak has 
declared that Egypt is not prepared to send a single soldier to 
Yemen, either as part of a peace-keeping force or otherwise. He 
said Egypt only sends troops abroad when there is an 
international dispute and to achieve specific goals. He 
affirmed that what is happening in Yemen is an "internal issue." 
  In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo to be broadcast 
today, 
the president said: I am not prepared to lose a single 
individual in an operation that is "not right." 
  Mubarak added that he had contacted Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
told them the Yemeni situation is not comforting. He said he 
asked them to disengage the troops for fear of a clash that 
might develop into an unmanageable armed conflict. Even if it 
could be managed, people will get killed and wounded and hatreds 
will emerge and trigger mutual vendettas and a guerrilla war 
might rage for years, Mubarak said. 
  The president added that the advancement of northern forces 
toward Aden will not solve the problem and the war will neither 
assist nor guarantee unity. War is a call for secession; it 
means occupation and so does entering Aden, he said, adding: 
The world will not view Yemen as a united country. 
  They are reassuring me that the issue will end, but in fact 
I 
do not see any hope, Mubarak said. 
  President Mubarak added that he is not against one side or 
the other. I am for peace, stability, and unity. The use of 
force will not lead to unity; it will light the fuse of 
retaliation, he said. The president asked: Is this in the 
general interest? Has the Arab world been afflicted with states 
that devour their neighbors? How can two states unite and then 
end up fighting each other? 
  Mubarak regretted what is happening, hoping that the two 
parties to the crisis will reach a solution, although he doubts 
this is possible. All that is happening is a result of the Gulf 
war, he remarked. 
  Touching on the Arab situation, Mubarak said that bringing 
Arabs back together will take a long time, because the Gulf war 
caused deep wounds. 
  He added that Egypt is trying and that the Palestinian 
president had met with the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. 
  The president added that he talked to the Gulf states and 
the 
situation with Jordan is slightly better now. He pointed out 
that the Gulf states are still bitter over what had happened. 
They believe that King Husayn was involved. But we are trying 
to clear the air, and the situation today is better than it was 
two years ago, he said. 
  The president pointed out that the invasion of Kuwait was a 
very serious matter for all Gulf states, particularly since 
information indicated that Iraq would not stop at Kuwait's 
invasion and that the situation would develop until it affected 
the entire Gulf region. 
  President Mubarak announced that Egypt opposes the 
partition of Iraq and that it sympathizes with the Iraqi people. 
However, it seems that the international community insists on 
continuing the sanctions on Iraq while President Saddam Husayn 
remains in power. 
  The president said: We are opposed to the removal of a head 
of state through the intervention of foreign powers. The people 
are the ones who should decide whether or not a president should 
stay in power. We could never accept a head of state being 
harmed by foreign forces. I have spoken to some countries about 
this issue. 
  The president affirmed that lifting the blockade of Iraq is 
not an easy process and will require time. The president added 
that he sympathizes a great deal with the Iraqi people, as do 
the Egyptian people. 
  Discussing the peace process in the Middle East, President 
Mubarak said that the question of Palestine is over 45 years 
old. Therefore, it is a very complicated issue and many new 
complications will emerge in the coming stages of the 
negotiations. 
  He added: It will not be easy for the Palestinian 
administration to manage affairs because it will take power 
after autonomy is actually implemented. However, it is the best 
option because it comes in close contact with the problems of 
the people. He said that the problem of settlements is another 
complicated matter. It was only natural for problems to crop up 
at the last minute during the ceremony for signing the autonomy 
agreement considering the nature of the problem. "The road is 
still long," because the Palestinian problem is more complicated 
than any of the other problems that fall within the Middle East 
issue. 
  President Mubarak said that the Gaza-Jericho Agreement is a 
first step. I was of the opinion that the Palestinians should 
first set foot in their territory. They can then start the 
confidence-building process with Israel so that the Israelis can 
feel at ease about their security, which is a very sensitive 
matter to them. The president affirmed that both president 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin made a very 
courageous decision in reaching this agreement. However, the 
situation still needs a great deal of time to reach the final 
solution. 
  Regarding the negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track, the 
president said that he hopes the two parties reach an agreement 
before the end of the year. He expressed his belief that the 
problem now is the lack of confidence between Syria and Israel. 
Israel wants to know what it will get in return for the land and 
Syria wants to know what it will get in return for peace. The 
issue is one of confidence. 
  He added that the issue will take some time and that each 
party must gradually get to understand the other party. Perhaps 
the Syrian question is not as complicated as the Palestinian one 
because it involves only the Golan Heights. 
  The president said that Israel wants to fully normalize 
relations with Syria, which means opening the borders and 
establishing diplomatic relations. Normalizing relations 
requires some time, as was the case with Egypt and Israel. 
  Regarding Jordan, President Mubarak said: There are some 
issues such as the borders, but I believe that the Jordanian 
problem is on its way to being resolved. 
  President Mubarak was asked about the apprehensions 
regarding 
the Middle Eastern common market and fears that the Egyptian 
role in the region will diminish. He said: I have heard about 
the Middle Eastern market and a great deal has been said about 
it, without this market actually existing; but talk about it 
continues. In the final analysis, no one will impose anything 
on us, and nothing can happen in the region without our being 
fully convinced of it. In any case, Egypt will be at the top. 
  On the possibility that the terrorist operations taking 
place in Egypt from time to time might affect the country's 
democratic experience, President Mubarak said: No one can harm 
the democratic process in Egypt. Had this been possible, then 
these terrorists could have attained something. 
  The president added: We are keen on democracy and freedom. 
There has never before been freedom like that which exists in 
our country now, not even under, before, or after the monarchy. 
We are convinced that we are not working to "abort" democratic 
pluralism. What we are doing is in line with the Constitution 
and the law. I do not like to violate them at all, because I am 
establishing the bases for the future. I support freedoms even 
though some papers are not writing objectively. But I say let 
the people learn and get to know right from wrong and to discern 
good from bad. 
  President Mubarak went on to say: Studies to determine the 
public's situation began as soon as I took over. The 
infrastructure--such as the bad sewage system, electricity and 
water supplies, and the railroads--was minimal. The 
infrastructure had to be reformed so that we could get the 
investment we wanted but which investors were hesitant about. 
Hence, we held the economic conference in 1982 and this 
resulted in the plan we are proceeding with now, with amendments 
made from time to time. We started with the infrastructure and 
this continued for several years. We found out that we had the 
problem of slums--which began in the sixties-- poor people, and 
unemployment, like all other countries. 
  President Mubarak said: When I took over, we had 500,000 
telephone lines, including 300,000 that were not working. We 
now have three million lines and we can call Japan, the United 
States, anywhere in the world. We had the same problems with 
electricity. 
  The president explained that the infrastructure work cost 
too 
much and this caused us problems, but God made it easy for us. 
He said: Half the debts have been cancelled and we are now 
looking at priorities, such as the slums and unemployment. We 
have many new cities--that is, 13--where there is work. 
  Asked if the citizens can feel the state's confrontation 
with 
corruption, the president said: Corruption exists among human 
beings wherever they are. Egypt is one of the countries that 
suffers the least from corruption. There is not a single 
corruption case that the state has not monitored or followed. 
He added: I wish those who are talking about corruption would 
reform themselves first. Some people talk loudly about 
corruption in order to cover up their own corruption. But I do 
not want to mention any names. 
  The president said: I want you to name one country where 
there are only angels. Any government in any country has 
bureaucracy. In any country that has public money, those in 
charge know that they are held accountable. 
  Asked if some of the local leaders submit to extremists, 
President Mubarak said: This happens, but it is not a major 
phenomenon. The local government councils are all right and 
those in charge of them are conscientious. All the people are 
aware and make the right decision.

  [Text] London, May 12, IRNA -- The British Government 
refused to comment Thursday on its MI6 intelligence service 
bugging the Iranian Embassy in London. 
  A spokesman for the Foreign Office was adamant that there 
was 
no official response to hidden microphones being found in the 
newly renovated mission, which only reopened six months ago. He 
did not expect any comment would be made about the illegal 
bugging. 
  The tight-lipped reaction was met with a news blackout in 
the 
British media, which even extended to the PRESS ASSOCIATION, the 
UK's national news agency, not carrying the Wednesday night 
report of the disclosure by Iran's president, Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  With dailies exercising the same trend and only a few 
carrying extracts from foreign agencies, the suggestion was that 
there had been a blanket ban imposed to hide the government's 
humiliation of being caught red-handed contravening 
international law. 
  The disclosure also reveals that the UK's recent propaganda 
campaign to discredit Iran was orchestrated to cover the 
embarrassment of being found spying on a foreign embassy in 
London. 
  The Iranian Foreign Ministry disclosed that the devices were 
discovered before the UK Government, assisted by the British 
press, launched smears two weeks ago that claimed Iranian 
intelligence had links with the IRA. 
  Bugging a foreign mission is nothing new to British 
intelligence. Former agent, Peter Wright, has revealed in his 
"Spycatcher" book that such clandestine activities extended to 
even embassies of Britain's allies. 
  It has also been disclosed that the UK has tapped the telex 
lines of IRNA in London, when the interception warrant was found 
to be still in place long after the location of its bureau was 
removed from Leicester Square in 1987. 
  All international telecommunications are commonly assumed to 
be monitored by the government's communications headquarters 
(GCHQ) in Cheltenham, western England.

  [Text] The SABA' news agency has learned that brother 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
has issued an order to Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh 
Mansur, the Defense Minister, to destroy all the partitionist 
fortifications in al-Dali' and Karish which were under the 
control of the forces loyal to the gang of rebellion and 
secession of the Yemeni Socialist Party leadership. The order 
was given after the forces of unity and legitimacy were able, 
with God's help, to control these positions and defeat the 
forces of the secessionist gang and remove them over the past 
few days. 
  It is worth mentioning that immediately after assuming 
control of the Mukayris area, our brave Armed Forces, the forces 
of unity and Constitutional legitimacy, destroyed all the 
partitionist fortifications as a symbolic expression of removing 
the most important remnants of the hated partition and as a 
moral consecration of unity, for whose sake our Yemeni people 
have struggled and for which they made great sacrifices, thus 
crowning their sacrifices with the restoration of the homeland's 
unity on 22 May 1990 and the proclamation of the Republic of 
Yemen.

Salih, and then related to him Yemeni developments from A to Z. 
I explained to his majesty ... 
  [Dhiyab, interrupting] Mr. Minister, have there been any 
Arab initiatives about Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] Mediation would be in order when you have two 
evenly matched sides. We are not after a military victory in 
order to force our control over all of Yemen. A political 
solution should be pursued, in the sense of securing the 
participation of citizens of the southern governorates in 
office. This is what the president intends to do -- to let 
southern-born Yemenis keep the positions they had previously 
been allocated.

<F P=106> [Report by HATZOFE correspondent and news agencies] </F>
  [Text] Senior PLO members and Israeli legal experts are 
due to meet in Vienna today for an initial discussion of the 
final status of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, which is to be 
determined after a period of temporary self government. This 
was reported by Palestinian sources yesterday. 
  "This would be a first meeting between the PLO and Israel on 
this level," one of the Palestinian sources said. According to 
the source, the Israelis taking part in the meeting are: Eli 
Dayan, chairman of the Labor Knesset faction; Labor Knesset 
Members Yosi Katz and Avigdor Qahalani; Shim'on Shamir, formerly 
Israel's ambassador in Egypt; and Peace Now representative Orit 
Rosen. 
  The Palestinians are represented by Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, 
adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat; Hasan 'Abd-al-Rahman, PLO 
representative in Washington; Furayh Abu-Middayn, who was 
recently appointed member of the Palestinian administrative 
council; Ibrahim Kar'in, head of the Palestinian information 
office in Jerusalem; and Rahhab al-'Isawi, a Hebron University 
professor. 
  The interim self government in the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho 
region will operate for a limited period, and negotiations on 
the final status of the territories are to begin no later than 
three years after the implementation of the autonomy agreement 
begins. 
  The two-day "private" meeting in Vienna, however, is taking 
place with the full knowledge of the Israeli and the PLO 
leaders, the source told a REUTER correspondent. 
  The meeting is sponsored by the Austrian Kreisky Fund. It 
will deal with issues such as refugees, settlements, borders, 
and the confederation. According to the sources, these issue 
were left as a basis for negotiations on the final status of 
Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 13 May 
carries a live telephone interview with Knesset Member Eli Dayan 
in Vienna. Asked to confirm the above report, Dayan says: "It 
is true that we are holding a meeting, but not on the issue you 
have mentioned. It is important to hold meetings with 
Palestinian representatives and see how they deal with the 
interim agreement." 
  [Dayan later denies that he and the other Israelis are 
following instructions from the prime minister and the foreign 
minister to discuss the permanent arrangement. Stressing that 
the meeting is private, he adds: "The interim agreement says 
that its duration can be cut shorter since, by nature, an 
interim agreement is temporary. We want it to succeed and want 
to hear what can be done to promote the permanent arrangement, 
which is more stable." Dayan goes on to say that he will report 
to the prime minister upon his return to Israel.]

Peri] 
  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat will meet in Oslo on 18 May. 
  This will be the first meeting between the two men since the 
signing of the Cairo agreement and the evacuation of Jericho. 
  The two men were invited to participate in the unveiling 
ceremony of the statue of peace, which was donated to the 
Norwegian trade unions' research institute by the Jimmy Carter 
Institute, in recognition of Norway's role in promoting the 
negotiations between the PLO and Israel. 
  Former President Jimmy Carter, will also attend the ceremony 
which will be followed by a debate with Carter, 'Arafat, and 
Peres on the ways to promote peace in the Middle East. 
  At an unofficial meeting with Labor Knesset Members held in 
Vienna over the weekend, 'Arafat's adviser, Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, 
promised that the PLO would abrogate the clauses in the 
Palestinian Covenant which call for the destruction of Israel. 
  [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-Tibi said that the clauses would be nullified as soon 
as certain logistic problems were resolved. He refused to be 
more specific as to the nature of these problems. 
  "When the Palestine National Council convenes in Palestine, 
these clauses will be changed," al-Tibi said. 
  Although no practical progress was reported in the talks, 
the 
participants said on 13 May that they had agreed on the need to 
dismantle the settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom.

<F P=106> [Report by Walid Shuqayr: "Tokyo: Christopher May Carry </F>
Practical Proposals"] 
  [Excerpts] Japanese officials have told AL-HAYAH that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the 
Middle East "may bring U.S. ideas and proposals for the sake of 
achieving progress in the bilateral Syrian-Israeli negotiations." 
  They pointed out that Christopher's recent visit to Syria 
"carried a proposal on gradual Israeli withdrawal from the Golan 
(Majdal Shams First), but Syria did not accept it. But the 
discussions which have taken place may enable him in his 
upcoming visit to prepare suitable ideas and proposals regarding 
practical measures. In that case, Syria will be willing to 
engage in better discussions with him, in a manner leading to 
the required progress on this track." 
  The Japanese officials added: "It seems it is a matter of 
time as to when give and take will begin between Syria and 
Israel." [passage omitted] 
  An authoritative [Japanese] Foreign Ministry source, who 
asked to remain anonymous, said: "Israeli prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin expressed to us his wish to convey his view to 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in connection with bilateral 
negotiations between the two countries, his conception of peace 
between them, the regional need for peace, and the need to push 
Syria to take further steps in these negotiations and to 
participate in the multilaterals. We conveyed the message to 
the Syrians. And the Syrians gave their answers to the 
Israelis' questions we conveyed to them. But they also wanted 
us -- so it seems -- to convey their message and position to the 
Americans." [passage omitted] 
  The source added: "Rabin believes that Syria is not serious 
in seeking peace, and he wants it to join him. The Syrians are 
not far from saying that the time has come to focus on the 
Syrian track. They rejected the Israeli proposals talking of 
withdrawing first from one area of the Golan. And their reply 
to the specific questions the Japanese delegation conveyed to 
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' about acceptable 
proposals regarding the timetable for withdrawal from the Golan 
was: The Israelis occupied the Golan Heights in six days...the 
withdrawal can be completed in the same period." 
  The source pointed out that al-Shar' told the Japanese 
delegation that "it took Israel less than two years to complete 
the withdrawal from the Sinai desert, which is much larger than 
the Golan." He was commenting on Israel's talk of a phased 
withdrawal from the Golan over eight years. 
  The Japanese source said that "while Rabin believes Syria is 
unwilling to conduct a serious and detailed discussion of the 
issues of peace, environment, and economic cooperation in the 
framework of the multilaterals, the Syrian side responded 
cautiously to Tokyo's encouragement to join the negotiations. 
President al-Asad said he is not against them, but Syria will 
participate in them only when or after progress has been made in 
the bilaterals -- progress that is practical and clear." 
  The source believes that "the Syrian position is tactical. 
President al-Asad is fully aware that the time has come to make 
a decision, and that the historic moment for peace emerged when 
he informed U.S. President Bill Clinton at the Geneva summit of 
his willingness to establish normal peaceful relations with 
Israel. But he wants a high price for that. He knows that Rabin 
is willing to relinquish all the Golan gradually and to 
demilitarize the border. But he wants more than what Rabin is 
proposing. Maybe he wants clear guarantees."

  [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has called on Yemeni leaders to 
comply with Arab efforts to end the war and to return to the 
negotiating table. 
  Speaking at a press conference today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said 
that every Arab wants to see the fighting stopped as soon as 
possible. He described the situation in Yemen as "painful and 
serious." He said he spoke via telephone today with Muhmammad 
Sa'id Bayraqdar, member of the Arab League team currently in 
Sanaa, to discuss the team's efforts to end the deteriorating 
situation in Yemen. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid noted that the team will 
meet later today with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to 
pass on a message from the Arab League secretary general. The 
message, he added, is part of the efforts to implement the 
recent Arab League decision to end the fighting in Yemen, to 
contain the deteriorating situation, and to start a dialogue 
among the warring parties. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that it is 
unlikely that an Arab summit will be held at the present time to 
discuss the situation in Yemen. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid noted that the Arab League welcomes any 
Yemeni proposals to end the fighting and bloodshed. He stressed 
that finding a solution for the Yemeni problem rests with the 
Yemenis themselves. He pointed out that Arab efforts are 
seeking to contain the crisis, reach an immediate cease-fire to 
halt the bloodshed, and bring the Yemeni parties back to the 
negotiating table to find a peaceful solution for the crisis. 
This, he added, is the task of the Arab League team now present 
in Sanaa. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid noted the need to establish a mechanism 
for 
settling inter-Arab conflicts. He added: Serious attention 
must now be given to establishing this mechanism, which the Arab 
leaders included in the Arab League Charter in 1945, something 
that shows their wisdom and farsightedness.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Wahab al-Sakit, </F>
director of the Arab League's Arab Department and member of the 
Arab League delegation in Sanaa, by an unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Is the Arab League delegation's 
visit to Sanaa for mediation or to learn about the latest 
developments there? 
  [Al-Sakit] The mission is in implementation of the Arab 
League Council's decision of 7 May expressing the Council's 
concern about developments in Yemen and its desire for peace and 
stability in this Arab state and founder of the Arab League. 
Arab League Secretary General Dr.'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has 
received scores of cables and messages from Arab leaders and 
popular and nongovernmental organizations demanding that the 
Arab League play a role in this regard. 
  [Correspondent] An Arab League role is required, as you have 
mentioned, but have you sensed a response by the Yemeni leaders 
accepting the Arab League mediation? 
  [Al-Sakit] All the Yemeni leaders and people are eager to 
see 
an end to the bloodshed in the Republic of Yemen and to cling to 
legitimacy and to the Yemeni territories' unity and stability. 
  [Correspondent] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has 
appealed 
to the Arab League and fraternal Arab countries to intervene to 
halt the fighting. This means that the southerners are willing 
to stem the bloodshed and end the war. What about the 
northerners? 
  [Al-Sakit] Everyone is demanding a cease-fire. It is in no 
one's interest that the bloodshed should continue in Yemen. All 
the Yemeni parties are very eager to stop the bloodshed but the 
situation requires some contacts, consultation, and [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Sanaa has reportedly rejected a YSP proposal 
to halt the fighting and control the crisis. 
  [Al-Sakit] As I said, the sides are eager to initiate the 
measures necessary to stem the bloodshed. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that the door to dialogue has 
not been closed and that there is still hope that the parties 
will resume dialogue and that a political solution to the crisis 
will be reached? 
  [Al-Sakit] We think so. God willing, the situation will end 
as the sincere people of the Arab nation desire. 
  [Correspondent] Will the League delegation head for Aden? 
  [Al-Sakit] The situation is not clear.

unjustifiable U.S. decision to include some Arab states, 
especially Syria, in the list of states sponsoring terrorism. 
In an exclusive statement, 'Imran said the U.S. statement has

be a fundamental reconsideration of U.S. Middle East policy and 
that a form of balance and nonalignment will be established.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- The Arab Bar Association has 
expressed its concern about the continuation of the sanctions 
imposed on Iraq despite the fact that their harmful effects 
infringe on the Iraqi citizens' basic rights to food and 
medicine. 
  In a statement issued today, the association said that Arab 
lawyers, appalled by the continuation of these conditions 
imposed on the Iraqi people, appeal to the UN Security Council 
members and president, the UN secretary general, and 
international humanitarian organizations to immediately lift 
sanctions imposed on Iraq. 
  The statement was issued on the occasion of the debate that 
the UN Security Council will hold tomorrow to discuss continuing

<H5>  ISLAMISTS EXPECTED TO WIN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS </H5>
  A 100-word report on page 1 by Khalid Yunis says that 
elections for the Lawyers Association branch in al-Jizah will be 
held on Sunday [8 May] and that the competition is mainly 
between "the Islamic Trend List, which includes Ahmad Rabi' 
Ghazali, Mahir Ghurab, Shawqi Dawud, and Fawzi al-Jazzar, and 
the Patriotic List." He adds that the Islamists are expected to 
win. 
<H5>  STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE AGAINST ISRAELI-PLO AGREEMENT </H5>
  A 210-word report on pages 1 and 7 by Salah al-Nahif and 
'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad details the demonstrations staged by the 
Cairo University students on 4 May to protest the signing of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement. The report says the students 
chanted anti-Zionist slogans such as "Kheyber Jews, Muhammad's 
army will return" and "Islamic, Islamic, Palestine is Islamic." 
The report adds that the Islamic trend in the university issued 
a statement in which "it denounced the agreement and noted that 
it includes secret clauses according to which the PLO pledges to 
stop all the anti-Israel media campaigns and to liquidate any 
political or military campaign by the Palestinian opposition 
that aims to destroy Israel. The PLO also pledged to protect 
the lives of Israeli citizens and is not opposed to the building 
of Jewish settlements." The statement is cited stressing that 
the 'ulemas of the Islamic nation have unanimously decreed that 
religion does not allow peace [al-sulh] with the Jews. The 
statement is quoted as asking: "Do we say that the Koran is 
wrong and listen to the scared capitulationists?" It is also 
said to have highlighted the "need to declare jihad to liberate 
Palestine's territories and the captured al-Aqsa Mosque." 
<H5>  'ABD-AL-RAHMAN DENIES REMARKS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM </H5>
  An unattributed 130-word report on page 7 headlined "'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman denies what has been attributed to him" says: 
"Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman has denied statements attributed to 
him by AL-AHRAR, which is edited by Wahid Ghazi. In a telephone 
contact, he said that what was attributed to him was pure 
fabrication. He added that an interview by 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi 
and the lies and fabrications it contained do not even merit 
comment. Muntasir al-Zayyat, the legal representative of the 
Islamic groups, said that what the aforementioned paper reported 
never happened, that no one from the weekly AL-AHRAR contacted

<H5>  MEDIA TREATMENT OF RELIGION CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 500-word article by Muhammad Ibrahim Mabruk on page 6 
deals 
with the way Egypt's television and media are dealing with the 
issue of terrorism and extremism. Asking what is happening in 
Egyptian television and media, he says: "They are confronting 
terrorism and bullets by making people despise religion and by 
spreading licentiousness and debauchery. They are confronting 
terrorism by throwing themselves more into the lap of the 
secularists. If al-Azhar defends the tenets of Islam against 
the secularist onslaught, then it is called extremist and is 
accused of practicing ecclesiastical hegemony and supporting 
terrorists. But the communists and atheists in general have the 
right to say whatever they like about Islam and its followers in 
the name of freedom of thought and interpretation." The writer 
adds that both the Islamists and the secularists know what they 
want and the victim is the people, which "has been forced or 
tempted to sell all its spiritual values and replace them with 
promised material temptations, which, it soon finds out, are 
false and in the meantime it has lost both spiritual values and 
material possessions." The writer then says that it is 
difficult for a people in such a condition to differentiate 
between what is right and wrong. Hence the secularists are hard 
at work to destroy the people's religious beliefs, which are 
based on Islamic values and concepts and represented by al-Azhar 
and Islam's imams. Thus, the writer adds, a neutral Islamic 
television is presented that does not mean or accept anything 
but "does not conflict with secularism, communism, and 
licentiousness. A day might come when someone will tell us that 
Islam does not conflict with overt blasphemy." The writer 
concludes by wondering whether the regime will respond to the 
"secularists' demands for estrangement between it and whatever 
is Islamic. Or will it reassess how far from the true Islamic 
tenets it has gone?" 

<H5>    LABOR PARTY OFFICIALS VISIT DETAINED PREACHERS </H5>
  An unattributed 100-word report on page 7 says that Labor 
Party officials 'Abd-al-Hamid Barakat, Naji al-Shihabi, and 
Muhammad Ibrahim visited detained Islamic preacher Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Sharif and party member 'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-Lutfi. 
The visitors conveyed the party leaders' greetings to the two 
prisoners for their part in serving Islamic propagation. The 
report says that the two were imprisoned for their propagation 
work through the Labor Party's cultural and religious seminars. 
The party leaders, it adds, have appealed to the interior 
minister to release them. 
<H5>  COURT RULES AGAINST DISMISSAL OF VEILED TEACHERS </H5>
  An unattributed 350-word report on page 7 details the ruling 
of the Administrative Court that the education minister has no 
right to dismiss women teachers who wear the veil. The court 
said in its ruling that "the veil is not banned either by 
religious shari'ah or by the law" and therefore the veil remains 
part of "personal freedom" and should not be banned. A ban 
"would infringe on personal freedom to dress and would restrict 
religious freedom." 
<H5>  LABOR UNIONS DEMAND RELEASE OF DETAINED PREACHER </H5>
  An unattributed 100-word report on page 7 says that the 
coordination committee of vocational labor unions in Alexandria 
has demanded the release of Islamic preacher Shaykh Wajdi 
Ghunaym, who was "arrested four times in a short period and 
acquitted after each arrest." The committee said that it will 
organize a sit-in at a date to be announced to protest his 
continuing detention. 
<H5>  YEMENI ISLAMIC UNIFICATION PARTY LEADER INTERVIEWED </H5>
  The paper publishes on page 8 a 1,800-word interview with 
Ibrahim al-Wazir, secretary general of the Islamic Unification 
and Action Movement in Yemen, by Muna Yasin, in which al-Wazir 
views the causes of the current crisis and fighting, the 
vagueness of the U.S. stance on Yemen's unity, the 
assassinations that preceded the fighting, and his party. 
<H5>  MUFTI'S THESIS ON JEWS REVIEWED </H5>
  A 3,500-word article on page 9 by Dr. Mahmud Himayah, 
identified as head of the Propagation Department at the College 
of Religion in Asyut, reviews the doctorate thesis of Mufti of 
the Republic Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi that earned him a doctorate 
from Al-Azhar University and was published as a 1,000-page book. 
The thesis, he writes, is a historic review of the Jews and 
"their wiles, schemes, and evil traits," particularly during the 
time of Prophet Muhammad. The book quotes extensively from the 
Koran and from Islam's early history to detail how the Jews 
schemed and plotted against the prophet and even tried to kill 
him. The writer says that "the odd thing is that this valuable 
thesis has not been published as widely as it deserves, despite 
the scientific facts it contains, which expose the danger that 
the Jews pose to the world and their schemes to control the 
world and destroy values and morals." 
<H5>  DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT IN JORDAN REVIEWED </H5>
  A first report from Jordan by Ashraf Khalil appears on page 
8. The 1,700-word report starts by reviewing the birth of 
democracy in Jordan in April 1989 and how the Islamic trend won 
in the first elections. It then moves to January 1993, when a 
decree was issued legalizing the formation of political parties, 
the most prominent of which is the Islamic Action Front Party, 
which is a coalition of the Islamic forces in Jordan. The 
reporter then interviews some of the leading Islamic figures on 
the Islamist stance on negotiations with Israel and other 
issues. The reporter then views the students movement in Jordan. 
<H5>  ATTACKS ON MODERATE ISLAMISTS CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 400-word article by businessman 'Ali Husni Rif'at on page 
9 
criticizes the campaign against moderate Islamic thinkers and 
writers, such as Fahmi Huwaydi. He says that the attacks on him 
are superfluous and do not deal with the substance of the issues 
being discussed by the thinker. He adds: "Are these gentlemen 
not content with their success and incitement against Huwaydi, 
which led to the disappearance of his calm articles, which 
hundreds of thousands waited to read in AL-AHRAM every Tuesday? 
Are they not content with this? Are they therefore continuing 
their vicious attacks, hoping, God forbid, to morally 
assassinate this man?" 

<H5>    REPORT DETAILS STATE OF CONFRONTATION WITH ISLAMIC GROUP </H5>
  A 2,000-word report by Jamal Imbabi on page 2 details a 
week-long visit he made to Asyut and nearby villages and towns 
to investigate the roots of the confrontations between the 
Islamic Group [IG] and the security forces and the effects this 
is having on the people and life there. He starts by saying 
that fear and anxiety prevail in Asyut despite the apparent 
calm. He then goes on to give figures on the victims of these 
confrontations. He says: "A quick reading of the statistics 
for the period between July 1992 and 1 September 1993 reflects 
the extent of the tragedy. During that period, (43) policemen 
were killed, including (seven) officers while (53) young members 
of the IG were killed. The figures also show that during the 
period between September 1992 and April 1993, that is, in just 
(seven) months, (14) policemen and (31) IG members became 
victims while the number of victims from among innocent citizens 
reached (42), killed by the bullets of the IG or the police. 
The same statistics show that (99) were wounded during this 
period, including (44 policemen), (8) IG members, and (47) 
citizens." He then adds: "It became clear during my stay that 
the IG is the strongest group in Asyut and its influence there 
is evident, especially among the young." 
  The reporter then deals with the emergence of the IG and 
with 
the speed with which it spread among the people, citing several 
local people from Asyut, Dayrut, and other towns and villages. 
A tribal chief from Dayrut, Haj Muhammad 'Uthman al-Kilani, 
says: "In the absence of an effective state role, these young 
men acted as if they were the state. They were successful in 
extending many services on every level and their leaders were 
capable. People trusted them to the extent that conciliation 
between Muslim and Christian families was not effected through 
the police but through them." The tribal leader and the other 
figures interviewed blame the government, accusing it of 
committing grave violations, not against these young ones alone, 
but against all the people. Television, for example, spared no 
effort to attack Islam and Muslim scholars were notable by their 
absence. 
  The people cited in the report agree that both the IG and 
the 
police were at fault for the excesses. 
  The reporter then says that "as the confrontation is 
escalating and Asyut has been turned into a military barracks, 
where its streets are patrolled by armored vehicles carrying 
soldiers with their weapons ready in a fear-inspiring scene, the 
government is imposing a curfew on the most tense areas. 
Hundreds of suspects are brought in daily to the police 
stations and this has made the citizens fear going out at night. 
Even shops have closed during the curfews [as published] and 
this has affected trade and work. Opening up shop, going to the 
market, or even going to school has become subject to the whim 
of the officer in charge." 
  But Major General Sa'd al-Jammal, the assistant security 
director, tells the reporter that the security organ "is dealing 
with terrorism in Asyut in a planned and tactical way and does 
not follow the policy of collective punishment. If this 
happened it was not intentional. The security forces have drawn 
up a complete plan to eliminate terrorist operations and its 
results will appear soon, after coordinating with the 
governorates neighboring Asyut." On the nature of this plan, 
al-Jammal says: "It is based on raids of all the terrorist dens 
across the governorate to capture the terrorists." Another 
security source reveals: "A strategic plan has been drawn up 
with the help of a high-level team from the Interior Ministry to 
set up an operations room that will follow a different method in 
dealing with the groups so as to capture them before incidents, 
after identifying them, their escape routes, and movements. 
This plan also depends on eliminating the weapons trade and 
financing and on cutting off these groups' contacts with other 
governorates and with their imprisoned leaders." 
  The reporter cites an unidentified IG member in Asyut as 
accusing the police "of starting the confrontation and of 
deciding to liquidate the group. He said they did so in 
accordance with instructions received from high-level figures in 
the West, which made it a condition that the regime should 
liquidate the IG as part of a general liquidation of the Islamic 
trend, which the West calls Islamic fundamentalism. The West, 
led by the United States, linked continuing aid and economic 
assistance to Egypt with the elimination of the Islamic trend 
and set a period of two years for doing so, from early January 
1993 until the end of 1994." He then adds: "For this reason, 
the coming days will witness the most atrocious and ugliest 
campaign to liquidate the IG in all its areas. The 
confrontation will spread from Asyut to other places, especially 
Suhaj and Al-Minya." When asked whether the confrontations will 
move to other areas, the unidentified IG member says: "The 
state, not us, will start the campaign. Press reports about the 
arrest of all the IG members are not true. There are only 
random arrests. Arrested individuals do not belong to the IG. 
They were detained as suspects." When confronted with the IG's 
excesses, he said: "I stress to you that only 10 percent of the 
complaints concern the excesses. I admit that the IG members 
are not angels. There are some excesses."

  [Text] Rafah, 15 May (MENA) -- A new 314-strong Palestinian 
police force commanded by Colonel 'Abd-al-Majid Fadl Salih 
crossed at the Rafah border point on the way to Gaza today. 
  Col. Salih said the unit comes from the 'Ayn Jalut forces in 
Egypt together with some personnel from the forces stationed in 
Libya and Sudan. 
  Salih said the deployment of the Palestinian police forces 
continues in Gaza and Jericho. He said Badr forces have been 
deployed in Jericho and Rafah and that the northern, central, 
and southern sectors of the Gaza Strip have also been covered 
through deployment in Khan Yunus, Dayr al-Balah, Jabaliyh, and 
al- Shaja'iyah. It remains for the Palestinian force to deploy 
in Gaza City and the Eretz checkpoint on the border between 
Palestine and Israel, he said. 
  He said Palestinian police forces are now working to 
maintain 
security and order and protect vital installations, such as 
electricity and water stations, custom departments, ports, and 
airports. 
  Col. Salih praised the facilities provided by Egypt and the 
efforts made by the Egyptian Administration at the Customs 
Office, Passport Department, and border security to organize the 
entry of Palestinian forces.

  [Text] Rafah, 14 May (MENA) -- The Palestinian Liaison 
Committee has resumed its work in the Gaza Strip to take over 
the rest of sites allocated for the Palestinian national 
security forces and to take the final measures for the police 
forces' deployment. 
  Liaison officer Brigadier General Ghazi al-Jabali said the 
handover of police and civilian authority sites in the Jericho 
area has been completed and that the Palestinian authorities 
have begun work. He added that police forces are being deployed 
in the northern part of Gaza in preparation for its handover to 
the civilian authorities. According to the agreement, he said, 
the civilian authority should remain in place for a three-year 
transitional period under the PLO leadership. 
  Coordination official Colonel Zakariya Ba'lushah said that 
obstacles impeding the entry of some personnel of the 
Palestinian national security forces have been removed and the 
civilian police will assume their duties in providing security 
as soon as they enter. 
  Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majayirah said the forces 
coming from Libya, Sudan, and Algeria continue to assemble 
inside Rafah on the international border with Egypt and enter 
the Gaza Strip in stages according to a timetable being drawn up 
in coordination with the Israeli side. He added that the 
Palestinian national security forces are made up of several 
groups, such as the civilian police, security forces, and 
intelligence, in addition to civil defense and other police 
services, who will perform their roles in maintaining internal 
security and order; guarding military posts, border crossings, 
and public figures; and maintaining the security of the country, 
its citizens, and the self-rule areas. 
  Elsewhere, Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander in chief of 
the forces, and members of the civilian authority continue to 
follow up on the withdrawal from various sites, the Israeli 
withdrawal from the few remaining places, and the deployment of 
Palestinian personnel in them. This procedure is scheduled to 
be complete by Wednesday, when the self-rule authorities will 
assume their role inside the Gaza Strip and Jericho area.

  [Text] The Palestinian police commander in Jericho, Major 
General Hajj 'Isma'il, says the policeman whose gun killed a 
Palestinian boy yesterday and critically wounded his aunt, will 
be courtmartialed for negligence. Latest reports say the 
nine-year-old boy 'Amr 'Abid was accidentally shot dead by his 
brother, who was playing with the policeman's gun. Witnesses 
said earlier the boy was accidentally killed by a Palestinian 
policeman. 
  General 'Isma'il said PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat had called 
on the police to press forward with the investigation and make 
the findings public. Police said the boy would receive an 
official funeral with a police escort. Police officers who 
tried to pay a condolence call on the bereaved family were 
rebuffed by angry relatives.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- In a ceremony attended by 
Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat and member of the Palestinian National Authority 
Council, held at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo the United States 
presented $5 million to support the Palestinian police force. 
  This was announced by a U.S. diplomatic source. The aid 
shows U.S. support for the Middle East peace process and 
represents an installment of the $500 million that the United 
States pledged to extend over five years to back the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, the source said. 
  The source noted that the United States earlier provided 200 
vehicles to the Palestinian authority. 
  The source explained that the $5 million will be used to 
finance commodities and services in the first stage, such as 
raising salaries; moving police units into Gaza and Jericho; 
securing temporary lodging; and purchasing food, fuel, and 
clothing. The money cannot be used for military purposes, the 
source said. 
  The source said the U.S. grant is part of the U.S. 
Administration's extraordinary efforts to support and facilitate 
the deployment of the Palestinian police force so that a secure 
and stable climate can be created for the continued 
implementation of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule in 
Jericho and Gaza as signed in Cairo on 4 May. 
  Concluding the statement, the source said that the United 
States hopes its contribution will encourage the other donor 
states to speed up their vital support for peace in the region.

<F P=106> [By Lamis K. Andoni] </F>
  [Text] After a week of difficult negotiations, Palestinian 
leader Yasir 'Arafat has successfully talked prominent 
personalities from the Israeli occupied territories and the 
diaspora into joining a Palestinian authority to run autonomy in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  By Friday night, at least 17 personalities accepted to take 
part in the 25-member authority. Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) officials expected a complete list to be 
ready in the next 24 hours. 
  In addition to 15 names announced by the PLO, Palestinian 
officials said that prominent Palestinian businessman Munib 
al-Masri has joined the authority, while Dr. As'ad 
'Abd-al-Rahman, the Amman-based head of Shuman Foundation, is 
considering the offer. 
  Initial reluctance by key Palestinian figures was replaced 
by 
approval, apparently in response to Israeli threats to suspend 
the entry of the Palestinian police force into the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho and influenced by the wave of popular celebrations 
that swept the territories over the transfer of Israeli 
responsibilities to the PLO. 
  At least two PLO executive committee members, Jamal 
al-Surani 
and Jawid al-Ghusayn, were expected to join the authority, and 
even Dr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, who has condemned the 
economic part of the agreement, might change his mind. 
  The officials said that Arab -- mostly Egyptian -- and 
international personalities involved in the peace process have 
been trying to convince the architect of the Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement, Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) to join the authority. 
  The Palestinian authority is expected to include 15 
personalities from the occupied territories and 10 from the 
diaspora -- including two women from each category. 
  Three key figures who had initially refused to take part in 
the authority either in protest against the terms of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement reached in Cairo on May 4 or 
against Mr. 'Arafat's single-handed leadership style appeared on 
top of a list officially delivered by the PLO to the Israeli 
government on Thursday night. 
  Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, head of the 
Palestinian 
team to the bilateral negotiations with Israel, Dr. Sa'ib 
'Urayqat, and former Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, 
accepted to join the Palestinian authority after having snubbed 
the offer. 
  Both Mr. al-Husayni and Dr. 'Urayqat have expressed serious 
reservations about the autonomy deal and had urged Mr. 'Arafat 
not to sign it. But the biggest surprise was Dr. 'Ashrawi, who 
has repeatedly declared that she wanted to remain independent to 
head a Palestinian human rights commission. 
  In a lecture at the Shuman Foundation two weeks ago, Dr. 
'Ashrawi lambasted the PLO leadership for its handling of the 
negotiations with Israel. 
  By accepting the post, Dr. 'Ashrawi became one of two 
prominent Palestinian women on the Palestinian authority. Fatah 
Central Committee Member Intisar al-Wazir, widow of PLO military 
leader Khalil al-Wazir, who was assassinated by Israeli squads 
in 1988, was among the first to accept the appointment to 
practically the first Palestinian administration of part of the 
occupied Palestinian territories. 
  There were no statements made by the leaders especially Mr. 
al-Husayni, Dr. 'Urayqat and Dr. 'Ashrawi, explaining their 
position. But it seemed that they had decided to work from 
within the authority in spite of their dissatisfaction with the 
agreement itself and Mr. 'Arafat's modus operandi. 
  Mr. 'Arafat himself was undeterred by the three key leaders' 
negative comments about the agreement, and instead had 
challenged them to either join him to shoulder the 
responsibility or confine themselves to the role of disgruntled 
observers. 
  "'Arafat has been calling each nominee, especially the ones 
who oppose the Cairo agreement, and urging them not to abandon 
him at this critical stage," one PLO official said. 
  According to different accounts, the master tactician has 
been effectively challenging his critics to join him to face the 
task of building a Palestinian state instead of taking, "the 
easy way out." 
  Israeli threats to delay the entry of Palestinian police if 
a 
Palestinian authority was not declared and the enormous shift of 
the mood in the occupied territories in favour of the agreement 
have contributed to mellowing the initially vehement opposition 
to the provisions of he deal. 
  Mr. al-Husayni, however, is said to have asked for 
assurances 
that his authority as leader of Fatah in the West Bank should 
not continue to be marginalised and bypassed by Mr. 'Arafat, who 
has been using other channels to convey orders and instructions 
to the organisation. 
  Furthermore, the position of Mr. al-Husayni and Dr. 
'Urayqat is to a large extent reflective of the stand of the 
Fatah organisation in the West Bank, that insists on being 
represented in the Palestinian authority. 
  According to information available from the West Bank, some 
influential Fatah rank and file, including young deportees who 
were allowed to return last month had urged Mr. al-Husayni and 
Dr. 'Urayqat to accept. 
  Information available from Tunis and the occupied 
territories 
also suggest that many Fatah leaders feared that by boycotting 
the authority, the actual leadership will be confined to 
"traditional personalities" that have already accepted Mr. 
'Arafat's offer dealing a blow to Fatah. 
  Faced with reluctance by the historic leaders of the pro-PLO 
groups in the occupied territories, Mr. 'Arafat went straight to 
more traditional and conservative figures, sending alarms among 
the Fatah rank and file. 
  According to well-placed officials, Fatah officials strongly 
protested Mr. 'Arafat's attempt to appoint Jamil al-Tarifi, head 
of the Palestinian liaison committee with Israel, but who is not 
seen as part of the more militant leadership that secured and 
sustained support for the PLO over the years. 
  As names of members of the Palestinian authorities were 
starting to leak, many feared that it will be a weak body that 
would further consolidate Mr. 'Arafat's domination and will not 
challenge further concession to the Israelis. 
  Yet, it remains to be seen how Mr. al-Husayni, Dr. 'Urayqat 
and Dr. 'Ashrawi will reconcile between their misgivings about 
the agreement and being members of the body entrusted with 
implementing it. Well-informed Palestinian sources said that 
the three feel that they could influence the continuing process 
of negotiations, instead of leaving it to Mr. 'Arafat and a 
small circle of aides in the hope that future steps will pave 
the way for Palestinian sovereignty. 
  Other PLO officials were very critical of what they viewed 
as 
the contradictory position of the three leaders, who confined 
themselves to verbal protest but "towed the line" in the end. 
  Opposition officials, however, declined from attacking any 
of 
the personalities who accepted to join. 
  It was a sign that even the opposition hopes that the 
presence of outspoken critical members in the authority will 
pressure Mr. 'Arafat to yield some authority and not to block 
elections as many fear he would. 
  So far the Palestinian authority is basically a coalition of 
Fatah and independents. The major other group is the 
Palestinian Democratic Union, FIDA, led by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
It was still unclear whether Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh himself will join 
or confine FIDA's representation to personalities from the 
occupied territories. 
  'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, FIDA's leader in the West Bank, was 
already included in the authority and FIDA officials Sami 
al-Kilani and Zahirah Kamal are strong nominees. If Ms. Kamal 
is appointed, the Palestinian authority will include three women. 
  FIDA has publicly condemned the Cairo agreement but 
nevertheless decided to join the authority. 
  The Palestine People's Party (PPP), which has boycotted the 
last rounds of negotiations, has maintained its stand of 
refusing to be part of the authority. 
  Agencies add: PLO difficulties in naming a full slate of 24 
member for the Palestinian National Authority has become the 
latest snag in the much-delayed self-rule plan agreed last 
September. 
  The list so far includes Mr. 'Arafat, PLO Executive 
Committee 
members Samir Ghawshah and Yasir 'Amr, chief economist Ahmad 
Quray', two deportees and many of the prominent Palestinians who 
have taken part in peace talks with Israel since 1991, PLO 
negotiator Nabil Sha'th said. 
  Asked if all the nominees had agreed, he said: "None of 
these names is nominated without being fully negotiated first." 
  The PLO Executive Committee had approved all of them, Dr. 
Sha'th added at a news conference in Cairo. 
  Dr. Sha'th transmitted the list to Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin on Thursday afternoon and Israeli consent to it 
was only a formality, he said. 
  Dr. Sha'th said Mr. 'Arafat would appoint the remaining nine 
members within a week. 
  Asked why the PLO decided to send an incomplete list, he 
said: "It's because there was a need by the Israelis to be 
assured on our seriousness in starting to conduct the 
authority's business." 
  The PLO has spent much longer than expected making the 
nominations, which the Israelis had originally hoped to receive 
about the same time as the signing ceremony on May 4. 
  Other members including Dr. Sha'th himself, Zakariya al-Agha 
and Furayh Abu-Middayn from Gaza, Riyad al-Za'nun, Bethlehem 
Mayor Ilyas Frayj and deportee 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad. 
  Dr. Sha'th said he expected the Palestinian authority would 
be in place in Gaza and Jericho by next Tuesday but it is too 
early to say which members would have which responsibilities. 
  He said he himself had been reluctant to take part but did 
not feel he could refuse at this stage in the process. 
  Dr. Sha'th also said that the signing of agreement in Cairo 
has triggered a "faster pace of fund giving" by Western nations. 
  He disclosed new donations including 14 million francs 
($2.45 
million) from France for a police communications system, $2 
million from South Korea for computers and other equipment and 
58 military vehicles from Greece. 
  He said that 176 jeeps and trucks donated by the United 
States for the police from their European stock would arrive in 
Egypt next Sunday. The police have been hampered by a shortage 
of vehicles.

<F P=106> [Report by Basil Abu-Sumayah from the occupied territories] </F>
  [Excerpt] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
be the first Western official at the foreign minister level to 
visit the Palestinian self-rule area in Jericho. Christopher is 
scheduled to arrive in the city on Tuesday [17 May] to meet, in 
the headquarters of the Palestinian National Security Forces, 
with the commander of these forces, Brigadier Hajj Isma'il; 
senior Palestinian officers; and leading Palestinian figures, 
including Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, a member of the Palestinian 
authority. The U.S. secretary will also meet with Palestinian 
figures in East Jerusalem. 
  In a related development, Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former 
spokeswoman of the Palestinian delegation has stressed that she 
will not participate in the Palestinian authority that is 
charged with the running of the Gaza sector and the Jericho 
area. She told our radio that she will give priority to the 
Independent Palestinian Commission for Citizens Rights. 
'Ashrawi is the secretary general of that commission. 
  'Ashrawi urged Palestinians, including the opposition, to 
join in building Palestinian society, both in the national 
authority, the administrative agencies, and the institutions. 
She said members of the authority must have competence and 
credibility and be able to show commitment and will power so 
they can win the approval of all segments of Palestinian 
society. She said: There must be an integrated plan for 
reconstitution with the participation of all. No one can escape 
their responsibilities and the future challenges. [passage

  [Text] Jerusalem, May 15 (AFP) -- The ex-PLO peace talks 
spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi explained Sunday [15 May] she had 
turned down a job on the new Palestinian Authority not out of 
opposition but to focus on a human rights groups she has set up. 
  "I'm not turning away from responsibility... I'm working on 
something which I believe is important," she told AFP. 
  "I have a prior commitment to the Palestine Independent 
Commission for Citizen's Rights ... and that's where I feel I 
can be of most use. 
  "I feel that the National Authority should have people of 
commitment, integrity and credentials. I have chosen where I 
want to be and that is one way to participate in building our 
institutions." 
  'Ashrawi said she had been asked several times, but 
consistently turned down the offer. 
  "My refusal is not an opposition to the authority itself. I 
have encouraged everyone to participate in different ways in 
building our institutions. Everyone does not have to be in the 
Authority," she said. 
  Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
named her as one of 15 members to the new self-rule authority 
for Gaza and Jericho in a list forwarded last week to Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the Authority would 
be 
ready to take up its duties on Wednesday, by when the transfer 
of power in the autonomous areas is expected to be complete. 
  But 'Ashrawi is reportedly not the only one to have spurned 
'Arafat. 
  Israeli television said 'Arafat had appointed two other 
members Saturday -- Nabulus businessman Munib al-Masri and 
university teacher Sari Nusaybah, a Middle East expert. 
  The appointments were formally approved in Tunis at a 
meeting 
of the PLO's executive committee which also nominated Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO's Information Department, to the 
authority, a committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi told 
AFP in Tunis. 
  However, sources close to 'Abd-Rabbuh said he had asked for 
time to think about it. 
  'Ashrawi said her commission was now operational from the 
West Bank town of Ramallah. 
  "The commission is operational already, but we have had some 
technical problems such as setting up an office, so we are 
working from my home for the moment."

  [Excerpts] Our Middle East correspondent, Cecilia Udden, 
reports that cheering Palestinians gathered in the streets of 
Jericho when Israel handed over power after 27 years of 
occupation. It is not yet quite clear, however, which 
Palestinians the Israelis have handed over power to, she reports: 
  [Udden] [passage omitted] Many people are skeptical of 
self-rule and skeptical of Yasir 'Arafat's way of exercising 
democracy. Since December, many leading persons, including 
spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, have relinquished official 
responsibility. But yesterday the PLO announced at a news 
conference in Cairo that 15 people have been nominated, 
including Hanan 'Ashrawi, which came as a surprise to herself, 
according to reports received by this program. [passage omitted] 
  But one important name is conspicuous by its absence from 
the 
list of 15 candidates for the so-called Palestinian government: 
Dr. Haydar Abd-al-Shafi, the popular and respected doctor from 
Gaza, who led the Palestinian delegation when the peace talks 
started. People in Gaza say about Dr. Haydar that he is 
kind-hearted. I asked him whether he does not feel any pity for 
Yasir 'Arafat now that it seems difficult to put together a 
government. But Dr. Haydar is unrelenting. 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] I said that I am 
ready to participate if 'Arafat yields to democratic principles. 
It is his self-made problem. We didn't make the problem for 
him. [end recording] 
  [Udden] [passage omitted] The moment of truth will only come 
when elections are held in the West Bank and Gaza. The 
election, planned for July, can be held in the fall at the 
earliest. Dr. Haydar, who refuses to be a member of a 
PLO-nominated administration, can, however, envision running as 
a candidate in elections. I do not rule out the possibility, he 
says diplomatically. 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] Well, I don't 
rule that out. I only say it like this: I want to, but it is 
too early to say. I say I don't rule out my participation. 
[end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Washington peace talks and head of 
the Elections Committee in the self-rule areas, in Jericho, by 
Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo; date not given; from the 
"Dialogue From Afar" Program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] What progress is there in the transfer 
of authority to you and what are the tasks of the Palestinian 
police in the coming stage? 
  ['Urayqat] The Israeli forces' withdrawal from the Jericho 
area and the transfer of authority in all spheres were completed 
in the past two days. The Israeli flag in Jericho was lowered 
after 27 years of occupation and the Israeli Army withdrew, but 
they left behind a devastated infrastructure. For example, the 
hospital in Jericho on 14 May 1994 was worse than it was on the 
eve of 5 June 1967. 
  Naturally the Palestinian national (?security) forces' 
entry, 
deployment in the whole Jericho area, and assumption of their 
duties swiftly and in an orderly manner had a great impact on 
the people but the feeling that we have just begun still 
persists. 
  The road ahead is long, difficult, and full of obstacles. As 
a Palestinian, I can say that the planting season has begun but 
it is not yet the harvest season. This is the time to tighten 
our belts, a time for continuous hard work to achieve the dream 
of construction, especially as the normal progress in our areas 
has actually ceased since 1967. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What are your most important worries as a 
Palestinian National Authority member on Palestinian land? 
  ['Urayqat] The most important issue is the establishment of 
the infrastructure in the liberated areas, in the areas from 
which the Israeli forces have withdrawn. The infrastructure 
includes water, electricity, health, education, agriculture, 
industry, trade, communications, and roads. As I said, the 
normal progress and growth of these sectors in 1967, so our 
tasks are very difficult. 
  As you know, many countries around the world have extended 
aid, and studies were conducted (?by) the Palestinian economic 
team and the World Bank. We hope that the implementation of the 
scheduled projects, especially in the main sectors, such as 
health, education, water, and general health, will begin 
tomorrow if not today. 
  Regarding other issues facing us, construction is not easy; 
it is a complex, lengthy process. The Palestinian leadership, 
led by brother 'Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] has adopted strategic 
resolutions. A date for nationwide general elections and local 
government elections has been set. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] When will these elections be held? 
  ['Urayqat] The scheduled date is 15 October. As you know, a 
comprehensive accord was signed last week with the EC countries, 
which have become our partners in the election process. 
Preparations for these elections have been under way since 
November, when President 'Arafat issued instructions to form a 
committee for local government and elections. We are now 
working on all levels, including the spheres of law, training, 
preparations, and organization, in order to see that elections 
are held in no later than 15 October. But we must say that 
elections, whether on the national or local levels, cannot be 
held without the completion of the Israeli forces' redeployment 
in the entire West Bank. This means that the talks that began 
in Washington some time ago should continue and that the 
transitional phase agreement should be fully implemented as soon 
as possible so that we will be able to hold elections. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] And when will these forces be redeployed from 
the West Bank? 
  ['Urayqat] As I said, according to the Oslo Accord, this was 
set for 13 July, but the Gaza-Jericho negotiations broke down, 
which might automatically mean a delay in implementing the 
accord. Hence, the elections date was changed from 15 July 
[date as heard] to 15 October and we hope the Israeli forces 
will complete their redeployment and withdrawal from populated 
areas in the West Bank no later than the beginning of October. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] When will 'Abu-'Ammar arrive in Jericho? 
  ['Urayqat] Personally I don't know. I heard yesterday he 
will 
return on 15 June, but I say that brother 'Abu-'Ammar must come 
as soon as possible. 'Abu-'Ammar is used to suffering and 
building from scratch, and he must be with us to join us in 
laying the cornerstone of the infrastructure required for all 
our institutions. We now say that the time for work has begun, 
although the journey began (?yesterday). As I said, this is a 
season for planting, not harvesting, and we are all required to 
unite and pool our resources, efforts, capabilities, and 
expertise because we now have a chance to lay the foundation for 
a Palestinian society for the next century. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] You are demanding unity of the Palestinian 
fold 
at this important, crucial stage of the Palestinian people's 
history. Naturally there some in the self-rule areas who oppose 
the ongoing peace process. How will the Palestinian police and 
the Palestinian security forces deal with these groups? 
  ['Urayqat] First, the Palestinian opposition comprises the 
best of our social-conscious Palestinian people. Their 
opposition is not to the peace but to the conditions of the 
peace process. It is their natural right to express their views 
and say whatever they want. They are an inseparable part of the 
Palestinian people. The Palestinian police will act according 
to the law; all people will be under this law, without 
distinction. As for public and individual freedoms and freedom 
of expression, they will be protected by Palestinian law, by the 
Palestinian authority, by Palestinian society. 
  Our political life is built on several bases, represented by 
genuine democracy, political pluralism, and freedom of 
expression.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat; place not given; by unidentified studio 
announcer, in Algiers -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] We welcome Mr. 
Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to Yasir 'Arafat . The first 
question that comes to mind is perhaps how the Palestinian 
Authority is going to deal with the parties that still oppose 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement and endeavor to make it fail? 
  [Abu-Sharif] We consider opposition as a healthy 
manifestation, and opposition has the right to express its 
opinion as it likes, politically and through the media, but 
violence is rejected in our political life. We will welcome 
opinions no matter how different they may be, but we will 
confront violence. We are convinced that all the opposition, 
including the HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement] movement, will 
be committed to our democratic traditions that prohibit the use 
of violence as a means of resolving differences of views. 
  [Announcer] Some opposition sides consider that this 
agreement is turning into a simple administration, or something 
like a self-administration of the population. 
  [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that this is a first step. No one, 
neither Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, nor the Palestinian leadership 
have claimed that this is the solution. Not at all. This is 
the first step on a long road towards our own independent state 
with holy Jerusalem as capital. 
  [Announcer] As a first step you have agreed to the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army, but there remain the settlers 
naturally, and we know that the al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre was 
perpetrated by an Israeli settler. 
  [Abu-Sharif] It is natural that we should consider the 
settlers as part of the occupation machine, and all land on 
which an Israeli settler is residing is a Palestinian land 
confiscated in contravention to the international laws, the UN 
charter and the UN convention. For this reason, we will seek, 
through negotiations, to secure an agenda for the evacuation of 
the settlers from our Palestinian land, and no doubt the 
settlers are the ones who know better about their situation now 
following the withdrawal of the occupation forces. [passage 
omitted]. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, we know that there has always 
been talk about the liberation of all Palestine. Now, can 
Palestine be reduced to just Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Abu-Sharif] It can't be, naturally. As far as we are 
concerned, our aim of setting up an independent Palestinian 
state with Jerusalem as capital means setting up the state on 
all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. This is a 
literal application of Resolution 242. Furthermore, I would 
like to clarify beyond any doubt that the Palestinians will not 
sign a peace treaty with the Israelis so long as is not 
comprehensive, that is so long as it does not include Syria, 
Jordan, and Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab 
lands occupied in 1967, and south Lebanon which was occupied in 
1978. 
  [Announcer] And what is the place of Jerusalem to a 
Palestinian state? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Holy Jerusalem is a capital for an independent 
Palestine, and we will accept nothing short of an Arab 
Jerusalem, and there will be no peace without an Arab Jerusalem 
over which an Arab flag will flutter. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, what do you expect from Algeria 
in the struggle for the construction of Palestine now? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Algeria has always been a bastion protecting 
Palestinians whether right or wrong, and we expect the Algerian 
people that have always supported us in our military battles and 
in the struggle to back the Palestinian people now to build its 
own independent state. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Abu-Sharif, thank you for being present at 
the 2000 bulletin. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Thanks to Algeria, and thank you.

  [Excerpt] The Central Command of the anti-'Arafat 
coalition of the 10 factions has decided to transfer its 
operations to the occupied Palestinian territories to defeat the 
Oslo accord and its offshoots. The 10 factions plan to achieve 
this through mobilizing the masses in the territories to defeat, 
expose, and isolate the accord. 
  This was decided at a meeting held by the Central Command 
last Wednesday [11 May]. The five-hour meeting addressed the 
latest developments, particularly the Cairo agreement, ways to 
respond to the recent developments, activating confrontation 
with the enemy, and the situation of the Palestinians in 
Lebanon. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ghawshah Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
Hamas Will Not Use Violence Against Palestinian Autonmous 
Authority"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas, has announced that its opposition to the 
Palestinian autonomous authority in Gaza and Jericho will be 
political, informational, and popular, and that it will never 
use violence against it because all the violence will be aimed 
at the Israeli Zionist occupation. 
  It said that the opposition circle has increased with some 
of 
the negotiation "pioneers" joining it, having been frustrated. 
  This came in a statement made by Hamas official spokesman 
Ibrahim Ghawshah to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Amman. He said: The 
members of the Palestinian police are our brothers and sons of 
the Palestinian people and it is inconceivable in any 
circumstances that the Palestinian police would confront their 
own people. 
  But he added: If there are some sick minds who agree to 
serve the Zionist occupation, the people inside [the occupied 
territory] will know how to deal with them depending on the 
circumstances arising from such behavior. 
  Hamas' official spokesman defined the mechanism for his 
movement's political opposition in the coming phase under the 
Palestinian autonomous authority as follows: 
  1. Expose and point out the loopholes, mistakes, and 
drawbacks of the Cairo agreement. 
  2. Expose the Zionist hegemony over the autonomous 
administration which began with the entry of the police forces. 
The members of these forces were subjected to an inspection of 
their arms and a baggage search, and they were issued with 
identity cards by the occupation authorities. 
  3. Explain to all sectors of the Palestinian people that the 
laws and regulations enforced in the [Gaza] Strip and Jericho 
will be Zionist occupation laws and regulations and that any 
amendment or modification will be subject to a certain mechanism 
and subject to the approval of the Zionist authorities. 
  4. Explain that the Gaza-Jericho agreement places certain 
unpatriotic commitments on the Palestinian authority. Hamas and 
the Palestinian opposition will expose all these commitments one 
by one, beginning with the undertaking distributed to the 
detainees requiring them to renounce terrorism and accept the 
Cairo agreement as a condition of their release, and ending with 
the assertion that collaborators should not stand trial and 
should not be harmed. 
  The Palestinian opposition, Ghawshah said, is currently 
creating the broadest possible popular base in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip, and that base is growing every day on the 
grounds of opposition to the agreement. 
  He noted that some of the "pioneers" of the Madrid 
conference 
and then the Washington conference, such as Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, and some of the Oslo "pioneers" such as Yasir 
'Abd-al-Rabbuh of Fida [the Palestinian Democratic Union], and 
the People's Party and some sectors of Fatah itself, have joined 
the opposition. Some Fatah detainees refused to sign the 
occupation's undertaking committing them to acceptance of the 
Cairo agreement. Not only did they refuse to sign, they also 
condemned the agreement. 
  Ghawshah stressed that Hamas is present everywhere and is a 
skillful player on the Middle East chess board, and that it will 
act at the right time in the interest of the Palestinian people. 
  He said that Hamas will not disappoint those who have placed 
their confidence in it and will play its part fully in 
continuing the jihad operations against the Zionist occupation. 
  The official spokesman refused to reveal Hamas' plan in that 
respect but he said "we have made preparations."

  [Text] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, the chief of Hamas' Political 
Bureau, has reaffirmed that resisting the occupation is a 
strategic option for Hamas until the occupation is defeated and 
all Palestinian lands are liberated, primarily Jerusalem, the 
capital of Palestine and the land of the prophet's ascension to 
heavens and of all holy sites. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-MAJD in Beirut, Abu-Marzuq 
said military action is a primary means of resistance against 
the Israeli occupation. It has been proven that the Israeli 
occupation knows no language other than that of force. Take, 
for example, the outcome of the negotiations, which began with 
the illusion of the "state" and ended up in the farce of 
"Gaza-Jericho". 
  On the Cairo agreement signed recently between 'Arafat and 
Rabin, Abu-Marzuq said: It is a farce. This agreement, as its 
clauses show, is worse than the Camp David Accords. The points 
of this agreement explain the vague Oslo accord in favor of the 
Zionist enemy and at the expense of Palestinian, Arab, and 
Islamic interests. 
  Asked by AL-MAJD about the movement's official position on 
the agreement and the possibility of dealing with it as a fait 
accompli, Abu-Marzuq wondered sarcastically: Can any sane 
person accept this agreement or deal with it? Especially since 
many of those who support a settlement are now weaseling out of 
the agreement and refusing to deal with it. 
  Abu-Marzuq then said in a very serious tone: This "farcical" 
agreement does not commit Hamas and its heroes to anything at 
all. We are going ahead with our jihad scheme without paying 
heed to what 'Arafat and his tools conclude with the Zionists. 
  Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas 
and 
the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a 
good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this 
relationship, which will remain pivotal for us. 
  Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this 
relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad 
role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable 
step before resuming the plan of liberation. 
  Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist 
bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine] 
General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy 
and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying: 
We complement each other in the same trench and course. 
  On Jordan-Hamas ties after the recent problems resulting 
from 
Israeli threats, Abu-Marzuq said: Our brothers in Jordan know 
well that the threats of Rabin and Peres came to distract 
attention from Rabin's internal crisis first and from what was 
being cooked up between 'Arafat and Peres without the knowledge 
of Jordan, Syria, and the Arabs. 
  Abu-Marzuq asserted that Hamas is keen to preserve Jordan's 
security and stability. Jordan is the land of mobilization and 
steadfastness and the first line of confrontation against the 
enemy occupying the land of Palestine. Abu-Marzuq said he looks 
forward to good brotherly and lasting relations with Jordan. 
  On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if 
a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules 
out the possibility of such agreement in the short run, 
considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however, 
that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the 
occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence 
by any Palestinian or Arab agreements. 
  Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into 
Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the 
sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic 
battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their 
presence among the people there as long as they are protecting 
the people's security. This position will change if these forces 
change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress 
strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic 
political currents and persuasions.

<F P=106> [Report by HATZOFE's political correspondent in Jerusalem </F>
and ITIM reporter Dani Zaqen] 
  [Excerpt] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has recently 
contacted senior Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] members, 
through PLO men in the territories, and offered them seats on 
the Palestinian council which is due to rule the autonomy. 
  These days, 'Arafat is busy setting up the council, which 
will probably be made of 25 members, 15 of which from the 
territories. Several PLO officials in Gaza and Jericho have 
recently approached Hamas notables with an offer to join the 
autonomy council. 
  The ITIM reporter has learned that Hamas was offered three 
seats on the council and one executive post, and later the PLO 
expanded the offer to five council seats and two executive posts. 
  The Hamas members rejected the offer, but announced they 
would be glad to participate in the elections, which are to be 
held several months after the autonomy is established. 
  A senior PLO member in Gaza told the ITIM reporter that the 
Hamas response gives rise to optimism regarding their 
incorporation in the autonomy establishments -- which would 
force 'Arafat to call the for elections as soon as possible. 
The ITIM reporter says that the PLO members in Judaea, Samaria, 
and Gaza favor early elections, often contrary to the stand of 
'Arafat and his advisers in Tunis. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for </F>
Hamas, by Samir al-Hijjawi, "following the Israeli threats 
against Jordan;" place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Hijjawi] What is the position and 
viewpoint of Hamas regarding the PLO-Israeli agreements signed 
in Paris and Cairo? 
  [Ghawshah] At a first reading, these agreements, which were 
carried by the media, are amazing. In the past, the [Oslo] 
PLO-Israeli agreement was opposed for basic and principled 
reasons. One who is conscientious or patriotic, or one who 
loves his people will be amazed when he reads this agreement. 
This is because the agreement gives a complete and perpetual 
mortgage to Zionist occupation. I want to emphasize three 
points regarding the gravity of this agreement: 
  1. This agreement relinquishes both the land of Palestine 
and the Palestinian people's rights to the lands of their 
fathers and forefathers. 
  2. This agreement forces all factions of the Palestinian 
people into standing on the same slippery road, and places them 
face to face with one another, so the Jewish occupier can look 
at them and laugh, exactly as the merchant of Venice, the Jewish 
Shylock, laughed. 
  3. This is a false peace. Everything in it is a lie. The 
hypocritical world blessed the Palestinian and Zionist parties 
to this agreement. In fact, there is only one party, the 
Zionist party, which, as Peres said, has no other party to 
negotiate with. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Hijjawi] There is talk about releasing detainees who 
support these agreements, after they sign pledges not to resort 
to violence and resistance, and also about excluding detainees 
who oppose the agreements, including Hamas detainees. What is 
your view in this regard? 
  [Ghawshah] This is another tragedy. Regrettably, the 
Palestinian negotiating delegation, blessed by the Tunis 
leadership, distributed a pledge among all administrative 
detainees, so they would sign it, disavow the so-called violence 
and terrorism, and accept the Oslo agreement. 
  There are many signs showing that this took place with the 
knowledge and approval of the Palestinian side. This, in 
itself, is a tragedy and a crime committed against the issue of 
prisoners and detainees. The decisions made by the Tunis group 
cannot be made by an armed Arab Palestinian group. The 
decisions of this group are almost the same as those of the 
Zionist enemy. This explains the current state of amazement, 
frustration, and despair our Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories are experiencing. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Hijjawi] Preparations have begun for the entry of a 
number of Palestinian policemen [into Gaza and Jericho]. How 
will Hamas deal with these policemen? 
  [Ghawshah] The police issue is one of the dangerous mines 
planted among the Palestinian people. Undoubtedly, Rabin and 
Peres will laugh too much and exchange toasts when the last 
Zionist soldier leaves Gaza, because they know that they have 
put the Palestinian people face to face with each other, and put 
the Palestinian policemen and 'Arafat's men face to face with 
the Palestinian opposition, particularly Hamas. This serious 
image cannot be disregarded by any sincere person. We beseech 
God not to fulfill the Zionist planners' objectives and 
aspirations. The Hamas Movement has already said it will not 
attack the Palestinian police, if this police force carried out 
its duties of protecting its people. However, the situation 
will be very serious if this police force tries to chase the 
mujahidin and to prevent them from carrying out the duty of 
jihad, which is decreed by God. So, shall the mujahid respond 
to God's orders, or to this policeman who is executing Rabin's 
instructions? 
  [Al-Hijjawi] How you will act if the police force receives 
orders to fire at your men? 
  [Ghawshah] I cannot determine exactly how Hamas will deal 
with future developments, because the circumstance and the event 
itself will determine this action. However, we hope the 
Palestinian policemen will have a strong sense of responsibility 
and will not obey idiotic orders against their own people. We 
hope the youths of ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam will continue to 
direct their rifles against the Zionist occupation. This is not 
an easy thing. All faithful and sincere people should not be 
neutral, but they must prevent any inter-Palestinian fighting. 
What is taking place in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia is 
enough. There could be a ray of hope represented by an 
escalation of the jihad against the occupation troops in the 
West Bank. These mujahidin and intifadah youths will tell their 
people: "This is the real battlefield, come and join us." Only 
then will the crime of self-rule will be exposed. 
  [Al-Hijjawi] Can we understand from you that Hamas will seek 
to calm the situation in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Ghawshah] Hamas has declared that it will not confront the 
self-rule by force. This is dictated by the principled and 
national position. It is true that this is somewhat bitter, but 
you should drink what is bitter if you want to overcome what is 
more bitter. Avoiding resistance against the Palestinian police 
force and self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is a Hamas policy which 
it will pursue, God willing, in order to spare its people the 
evils of internecine fighting. At the same time, those who 
planned the agreement which was signed in Cairo on 4 May 1994 
must know that the mujahidin will not stop their jihad and that 
the intifadah people will not stop their intifadah. If the 
other party continues to pressure and harm its people, the 
consequences will be bad to all sides. We hope that this party 
will not use all its weight to achieve all that the Zionists 
want. We want to address a message to this party: "You are now 
on the touchstone, and you must prove that you are with your 
people and homeland, or otherwise, your people will discard you, 
and you will become one of those men who collaborate with the 
occupation and who are tools to it. This is the message we want 
to address in the name of the movement. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Hijjawi] There is a development in Hamas' political 
approach, which was clear in Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq's statements. 
Is this development moving toward dealing with specific 
political facts within the framework of a peace treaty, or is it 
a truce? Is Hamas still adopting its previous stands? 
  [Ghawshah] Let me say the interview conducted with Dr. Musa 
Abu-Marzuq contained some mistakes. Some of these mistakes were 
what was attributed to him about a treaty. The truth is that 
Hamas cannot agree on a treaty. This is a mistake. However, 
what Hamas said in the past, and even through Shaykh Ahmad 
Yasin, is that in case the Zionist forces withdrew and the 
occupation was removed, then it would be possible for Hamas to 
study a temporary truce. The temporary truce does not stipulate 
recognition of the other party. In the law of war and peace in 
Islam, truce is allowed. There is no objection to the truce 
issue, if the terms will be in the interest of Muslims. 
Regarding whether there has been a change in Hamas' strategic 
and short-term program, the answer to this is: Hamas' strategic 
and short-term program has not changed. The Hamas Movement 
considers Palestine an Arab and Islamic land from the [Jordan] 
River to the [Mediterranean] Sea. It is also an Islamic 
endowment. No one is authorized to relinquish one inch of it. 
Neither Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, nor Musa Abu-Marzuq, or Ibrahim 
Ghawshah or anyone else can do this. None of them has ever done 
this. This is part of the Muslims' creed. We cannot recognize 
the Zionist entity, achieve reconciliation, or hold negotiations 
with it. This is because as soon as we negotiate with it this 
will mean an official recognition. If negotiations have to take 
place, something which is ruled out, they will take place 
through a third party. What the Hamas Movement proposed was a 
short-term political view based on its strategic program. This 
is a reply to those who always say that the Hamas Movement 
program is nonexistent. 
  [Al-Hijjawi] How does Hamas view the recent Interior 
Ministry 
measures to facilitate Palestinians' movement? 
  [Ghawshah] The Islamic Resistance Movement was against the 
disengagement decision, because it was unjustified. We believe 
any measures adopted to facilitate visits by West Bank people 
and youths to the East Bank will reinforce the firm unity 
between the two peoples. We support unity between the two 
peoples, and Arab and Islamic unity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
arrived in Damascus this evening on a new shuttle tour aimed at 
advancing the peace process, which is being obstructed because 
of Israel's intransigent positions. On his previous visit, the 
U.S. secretary left Damascus with queries about the Israeli 
proposals that he had conveyed to Syria. The proposals, which 
called for gradual Israeli withdrawal at long intervals, were 
rejected by Syria, which stressed the need for a full and 
comprehensive withdrawal to achieve a just and lasting peace. 
  The chief of U.S. diplomacy knows that his current tour will 
not be any better than his previous ones if he fails to bring 
new Israeli ideas or acceptance of full withdrawal from the 
Golan and south Lebanon. U.S. State Department Spokesman 
Michael McCurry stressed prior to his chief's tour that 
Washington expects the peace process to be tough, suggesting 
that Christopher will find it difficult to push ahead the 
Syrian-Israeli track as long as negotiations continue to move in 
a vicious circle. 
  It is clear that if Israel wants to apply the Gaza-Jericho 
model to the other tracks, then it will not be able to 
infiltrate the Syrian track, which is totally different from the 
others, especially the Palestinian one. Informed sources point 
out that Christopher's tour of the region is surrounded by risks 
and difficulties and will not achieve its objectives as long as 
the U.S. Administration does not pressure Israel into accepting 
full withdrawal in exchange for full peace. 
  If Christopher ends his visit to Damascus stressing that his 
country will play an effective role in advancing the peaceful 
settlement--and this is exactly what Damascus is expecting from 
him--then Syrian officials will not say more than they did the 
last time: that they are awaiting his answers. If 
Christopher's tour fails this time, and doubts about its results 
came through the U.S. State Department spokesman who said that 
Christopher does not expect a major achievement from any of his 
upcoming tours, then this will shake the bases on which the 
Madrid peace conference was launched and that the Geneva summit 
between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton emphasized, namely, adopting international resolutions 
to implement the Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, a Syrian media source stressed today that any 
peace not based on comprehensive peace will be doomed to 
failure. The source said Syria is not the PLO and is not 
interested in peace outside the framework of international 
resolutions and the U.S. initiative, which is based on the 
principle of exchanging land for peace. The Syrian source said 
Syria is expecting the American partner to play a responsible 
role, put things on the right track, and help Tel Aviv rulers 
decide to withdraw, dismantle settlements, and implement UN 
Security Council resolutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Weekly Events" review by Fu'ad Da'bul] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] As peace knocks on Lebanese and 
Arab doors, the country's top three leaders [president, speaker 
of the Chamber of Deputies, and prime minister] are in 
disagreement. The only area of agreement left among the top 
three officials is a common, but passive, desire to keep their 
differences at a manageable level. 
  At last week's Lebanese-Syrian summit the three leaders 
discussed the government situation and the need to maintain a 
united front in the peace process. Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad said that this issue is up to them and that they should 
do what they deem necessary and useful. 
  It seems that President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Speaker Nabih 
Birri are in cahoots against Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. 
The president and speaker believe that the cabinet needs to be 
reshuffled to achieve political equilibrium in the country. 
They base their judgment on the country's current needs, not 
those of a time when a then-popular prime minister formed the 
cabinet amid public support and hopes for change. 
  As soon as a reshuffle was proposed, President al-Hirawi 
insisted that he should have a say in the new cabinet. Speaker 
Birri requested that the Finance Ministry return to the Shiite 
sect from al-Hariri's control. The prime minister, who kept the 
finance portfolio for himself, is letting Minister of State 
Fu'ad Sinyurah run the ministry. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister al-Hariri wants to address the 
issue of Christian representation in the government. He seeks a 
reshuffle that would satisfy Patriarch Sfayr and ensure the 
participation of the National Bloc Party [led by Paris-based 
politician Raymond Iddah]. A government blessed by Bkirki and 
containing ministers hand picked by Raymond Iddah, al-Hariri 
reasons, will end "dissatisfaction" among Christians. This view 
contradicts President al-Hirawi's view. The latter sees himself 
as the only person entitled to name Christian ministers. 
  Irked by a constant barrage of criticism from his own 
ministers and a stream of leaks concerning a cabinet reshuffle, 
Prime Minister al-Hariri went into "seclusion" [unofficial 
discontinuation of public duties], leaving a question on all 
lips: Where is the country heading? Will President al-Hirawi, 
aided by Speaker Birri, gain the upper hand, or will al-Hariri 
continue to fight for "survival?" 
  The answer is anybody's guess. However, according to 
available information, al-Hariri is determined to go on fighting 
for his government and own political future. The prime minister 
has a moral weight to reckon with and is determined not to leave 
an office he once walked into triumphantly without a fight. But 
he is faced with a president who also has a strong hand to play. 
  According to our information, with al-Hariri facing a 
government crisis with no end in sight, he may have to stick to 
the "seclusion" tactic first invented by the late Prime Minister 
Rashid Karami in 1969. 
  Sources close to al-Hariri say that the prime minister is 
determined to continue his seclusion until the ministers who 
attacked him back off. Al-Hariri plans to go on a hunting trip 
to Zimbabwe on 18 May. He is intent to brandish the sword of 
seclusion in the face of opponents who thought it would be easy 
to run him out of office. These opponents recently claimed that 
al-Hariri's star is waning and that his days in office are 
numbered. 
  According to our information, al-Hariri has told his 
visitors 
that he refuses to be defeated by a "knockout," declaring that 
he will take the blows and pay them back with interest. 
  President al-Hirawi, meanwhile, told B'abda's visitors that 
he has a constitutional responsibility to bear and that he is 
above petty calculations and is determined to uphold the 
Constitution and promote a spirit of reconciliation. Lebanon 
deserves to have durable reconciliation and lasting unity and 
the president is determined to cement both as the country 
buckles down for the task of making peace, al-Hirawi's visitors 
say. 
  President al-Hirawi wants to keep his differences with prime 
minister al-Hariri secret. His public position is that he is 
above internal disputes and cares only for the country's unity 
and safety. Unity and understanding among the three top 
officials are needed for domestic as well as external peace, 
al-Hirawi was cited as saying. 
  Knowledgeable observers say that Syria will not allow the 
Lebanese temple to come tumbling down on its allies. It keeps a 
bottle of "medicine" and a spoon at hand to treat the "second 
republic" at the first sign of ailment.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri returned to Beirut 
from Damascus at 2030 today after holding more than three hours 
of talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Before his departure from Damascus, Prime Minister al-Hariri 
said: It is natural for us to visit President al-Asad at every 
phase of our deadlines and to consult with him on matters of 
interest to the two brotherly countries. He added: Syria takes 
great credit for Lebanon's stability, a credit that is 
recognized by every Lebanese who is interested in national 
detente. 
  Al-Hariri added: My meeting with President al-Asad today was 
to assert these feelings and to thank him for his initiatives 
for Lebanon. It was also an opportunity to review the march 
toward stability in Lebanon and to coordinate the two countries' 
stances on the peace process.

  [Text] The town of Jericho and its environs were turned 
over to Palestinian control approximately 30 minutes ago. Major 
General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central Command, shook 
the head of General Hajj 'Isma'il, the commander of the 
Palestinian al-Aqsa Brigade, wished him success in his mission, 
and offered the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] cooperation. Maj. 
Gen. Biran said that the IDF troops had implemented the 
withdrawal with full success. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 462 Palestinian 
policemen have entered Jericho with approximately another 1,000 
expected to arrive later. Local residents enthusiastically 
welcomed the Palestinian policemen and flew PLO flags from their 
cars. 
  Maj. Gen. Biran signed an order banning Israeli citizens 
from 
entering the Palestinian autonomous areas over the coming days. 
The decree went into effect as soon as the Palestinian police 
assumed responsibility for the area. An IDF spokesman asserted 
that the major general signed the order due to security 
considerations. The entrance of Israelis into the Jericho area 
will only be permitted after security conditions there make this 
possible. 
  Yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Chief of Staff 
Ehud Baraq held up the entry of Palestinian policemen from 
Jordan and Rafah for many hours after the PLO failed to meet the 
conditions of the agreement and did not transfer a list with the 
names of the members of the Palestinian authority to Israel. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that this was 
a condition stipulated by the agreement signed by the PLO and 
Israel and Yasir 'Arafat promised to send the list by last 
Wednesday [11 May]. However, Israel was only given a partial 
list of 15 names out of the 24 members of the Palestinian 
authority late last night. Only then were the policemen 
permitted to cross the border checkpoints.

  [Text] [Yokhpaz] The historic handshake between Major 
General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central Command, and 
the Palestinian commander took place several moments ago. Major 
General Biran, you are speaking live on IDF Radio. What were 
your feelings at that moment? 
  [Biran] It was a very exciting moment. We have achieved a 
joint success. I hope this success is only the beginning and we 
will see over the next few days whether things are fully working 
out. There is a great deal of promise but reality is a bit more 
difficult and we must be realistic. 
  [Yokhpaz] What did the Palestinian officer say to you? 
  [Biran] We have been discussing things for many days and 
these issues are not for comment over the radio. 
  [Yokhpaz] Did you give them any last-minute tips prior to 
their entrance? 
  [Biran] Yes, we have agreed on our respective duties. 
  [Yokhpaz] Major General Biran, could you bid a short 
farewell live on IDF Radio to the Jericho autonomous area? 
  [Biran] We have implemented the government's decision. I 
salute the soldiers here who did an excellent job. 
  [Yokhpaz] That was Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran at the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] checkpoint at the entrance to what is now the 
Palestinian autonomous area in Jericho.

  [Text] "There is no chance of attaining peace with Syria 
without a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Anyone who 
believes al-Asad can be satisfied with less, is living in 
illusion." 
  These remarks were made yesterday by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on 
Peres in an address before members of kibbutzim in the Meggido 
Regional Council, held at Kibbutz 'En Hashofet. "Let us not 
fool ourselves with regard to al-Asad's demands. The precedent 
al-Sadat set in Sinai serves as a basis for his demands," Peres 
said. 
  Peres added that in addition to their demand for a 
withdrawal, Syria also demands reciprocal demilitarization. 
That is, if Israel demands that part of the Golan Heights be 
demilitarized, the Syrians will demand that the Upper Galilee be 
demilitarized as well. "Naturally, such a demand is impractical. 
When I told Egyptian President Mubarak about it, he laughed and 
said that had Egypt presented such a demand, the entire 
territory of Israel would have been demilitarized," Peres said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres favors permitting 
all Labor members who resigned in the wake of the Histadrut 
labor federation primaries to return to the party, including 
Hayim Ramon and his associates. 
  In an interview to Qol Yisra'el, Foreign Minister Peres said 
that the desire of Histadrut voters for a change should be 
respected. He adds however, that the results of the primaries 
must be honored if one seeks to maintain a democratic system. 
Peres warned of the danger of forsaking democracy to television 
in which a candidate's image counts more than level-headed 
considerations. 
  As for the political process, Peres asserted that yesterday 
had marked the completion of an important stage in the process, 
with the next stage of elections in the territories and the 
IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from population centers 
starting now. 
  From now on, Peres noted, there would be two parallel 
tracks: 
One, in Washington, where the expansion of autonomy to the rest 
of the territories would be discussed. The second track would 
deal with the early empowerment of the Palestinian residents in 
the fields of education, health, social welfare, and taxation. 
  On the eve of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour 
of 
the region, Foreign Minister Peres said there was no certainty 
that the visit would lead to progress in the negotiations with 
Syria seeing as up till now, Damascus had offered nothing new in 
its proposals which merely repeated previous, well-known Syrian 
positions.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Gay Bekhor] </F>
  [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
apparently visit Jericho on 17 May in order to get a first-hand 
impression of the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. 
  Christopher prefers not to focus exclusively on the 
negotiations between Syria and Israel during his current Middle 
East tour. It was originally proposed that Christopher visit 
Morocco with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres but the trip was 
canceled after Morocco's King Hassan explained that he had no 
intention of taking steps to normalize relations with Israel. 
Officials in the American peace team suggested that the 
secretary of state visit Jericho, and Israel expressed no 
opposition. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has explained to the U.S. 
Administration that he has no intention of making further 
declarative steps toward Syria and is now waiting for a positive 
reaction from Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the Israeli 
peace proposal. Israeli sources say that "the ball is now in 
al-Asad's court." Sources assert that by declaring his 
readiness to evacuate settlements in exchange for peace and to 
implement a significant withdrawal on the Golan Heights, Rabin 
had taken large steps to meet the Syrians half way, while 
Damascus had continued to adamantly insist that Israel declare 
its readiness to carry out a full withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights before any progress in the negotiations. 
  "The proposal handed to Christopher during his last visit to 
Syria was more detailed and practical than in the past; however, 
as far as its content there was no change in the old Syrian 
position," the Israeli sources noted. The sources said that 
Christopher would make it clear to al-Asad that Syria would have 
to take steps to promote the negotiations with Israel and at the 
same time prove that it had changed its policies with regard to 
terrorism and the drug trade. 
  The secretary of state will arrive in Damascus today and in 
Jerusalem tomorrow. He will probably meet Prime Minister Rabin 
tomorrow evening and again on Tuesday [17 May]. According to 
the reports which have reached Jerusalem, Christopher does not 
plan another shuttle trip between Damascus and Jerusalem and 
will leave for Cairo on Wednesday. [passage omitted] 
  [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew in a report by Pe'erli 
Shahar and Natan Gutman on pages 1 and 8 notes that "A different 
aspect of the negotiations with Syria that will be raised in the 
meetings with Christopher is the scope of commitments and 
guarantees the United States is prepared to give Israel in 
exchange for its withdrawal on the Golan Heights. This entails 
strategic cooperation, real-time satellite information, and of 
course, an estimated $5 billion in financial aid to strengthen 
Israel's defense and security systems."] 
  Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli 
delegation to the talks with Syria, will arrive in Israel this 
evening and meet tomorrow with the prime minister prior to 
Secretary of State Christopher's arrival. Yesterday in 
Washington, Rabinovich said that Israel expected Syria to accept 
the basic idea behind the "package" principal. Rabinovich said 
that he does not anticipate any progress in the negotiations 
without agreement on this issue. Rabinovich explained that 
although Syria cannot be expected to agree to every detail in 
the package, it must accept its underlying principle as well as 
an essential part of it. 
  Commenting on Syrian media reports, Rabinovich said 
yesterday 
that on the eve of the secretary of state's visit, Syria was 
seeking to paint a bleak picture of the situation in a bid to 
pressure Israel and the U.S. Administration. 
  [Later in the same report mentioned above, 'AL HAMISHMAR 
reports that "Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the 
Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, said that he was not 
surprised by the criticism leveled by the Syrian press at the 
Israeli package of proposals for an arrangement on the Golan 
Heights. `It is not surprising that the Syrians are trying to 
portray the situation in bleak colors on the eve of the 
secretary's visit. This is a transparent attempt to pressure 
Israel and the U.S. Administration,' Rabinovich asserted. 
  "The ambassador pointed out that there was a great deal of 
wisdom in the U.S. policy of lowering expectations from 
Christopher's shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem 
because many further visits were anticipated and one should not 
expect a breakthrough or dramatic progress on every visit. When 
he was asked to define Israel's expectations from Christopher's 
visit, Rabinovich said: `The purpose of this visit is to create 
the necessary energy to promote the negotiations and facilitate 
a substantive round of direct negotiations between Syria and 
Israel.'"] 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said over the weekend that 
there was no guarantee that Christopher's visit would lead to 
changes in the negotiations with Syria. 
  "The proposals submitted by Syria up to now are definitely 
not earth shattering; however, there are certain dynamics in the 
air and we need to continue trying to promote the negotiations 
with them," Peres said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Meron Benvenisti: "Agreement of Surrender"] </F>
  [Text] Now that the noise of the festivities saluting the 
Gaza and Jericho First agreement has abated and the expressions 
of ridicule regarding Yasir 'Arafat's buffoonery have been 
thoroughly exhausted, the time has come to ponder the cause of 
all this celebration and decide which party ought to be 
rejoicing. A perusal of the agreement's hundreds of pages 
leaves no doubt as to who stands to lose and who stands to gain 
from the deal. Through the hundreds of lumbering, ambiguous, 
and petty nit-picking clauses, subclauses, addenda, and 
protocols, the total Israeli victory and complete Palestinian 
defeat are clearly visible. 
  Minister Shulamit Aloni found the courage to mar the doves' 
rejoicing on the very first morning after the signing of the 
agreement: "Had the British written in so many restrictions, 
the State of Israel would not have been established," she said. 
It was an understatement, because (to use the same metaphor) 
the "British" have not left and the nation that is under 
occupation has, with its signature, legitimized the conqueror's 
continued presence. 
  The peace camp is celebrating and the right wing is 
screaming, but it can safely be assumed that were Menahem Begin 
among us today, he would have signed the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
with only minor adjustments, because this agreement represents 
the successful implementation of the formulas Israel had 
proposed during the autonomy negotiations -- formulas that were 
rejected at that time. It is safe to assume that several 
veterans of the frustrating negotiations held 14 years ago 
attended the recent signing ceremony, and their contempt for 
Yasir 'Arafat stemmed not only from his televised contortions 
but also from the fact that the Palestinians acquiesced on some 
very substantive issues which the Egyptians had refused to cede. 
  It is hard to tell what the Palestinians would have achieved 
had they not rejected the Camp David accords, and it is easy to 
understand the disappointment and rage of the territories 
leaders, who have realized the magnitude of their disgrace. Had 
the Israeli leaders not considered the phased implementation of 
the Declaration of Principles [DOP] so important, they should 
have rushed to implement it throughout the West Bank: They will 
never get a better agreement in terms of safeguarding their 
political and economic interests. 
  To gauge the Israeli success in implementing the 1981 
autonomy plan, one should read the article Yo'el Singer 
published in HA'ARETZ almost two years ago (31 July 1992), over 
a year before the DOP was signed. Singer described at length 
the Israeli proposals drafted by him at the instruction of 
Defense Minister Ari'el Sharon and outlined what Israel wanted 
to achieve in terms of "withdrawal," "redeployment," "source of 
authority," Israeli-Palestinian distribution of powers, the 
definition of "settlement areas," and the evacuation of Israelis 
from the "self-rule authority's" jurisdiction. All these 
proposals were rejected by Egypt: "They maintained that the 
autonomy authorities should rule throughout the geographic 
outlines of the territories and over all the people living in 
them, including the Israeli settlers and settlements. The 
Egyptians added that an Israeli presence in the territories is 
illegal." 
  Fourteen years after their introduction, the proposals have 
been fully implemented. According to the agreement, the 
"security annex," which permits free IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
troop movement and the continued existence of a "military 
installation" and areas of "security importance," expresses the 
"full implementation" of the "withdrawal" and "redeployment." 
This wording complies with the Israeli interpretation of 
Security Council Resolution 242. The military government's 
"withdrawal" will not prevent it from exercising powers detailed 
in the Cairo agreement. These powers -- unbelievable as it is -- 
include "legislative, judicial, and executive powers and 
responsibilities, in accordance with international law." 
  Thus, Gaza and Jericho continue to be under military 
occupation, and the Palestinians agree that the IDF's withdrawal 
does not nullify its status as sovereign and does not even 
restrict this status to the settlement areas. The Palestinians 
even agree that the entire complex system of military government 
orders, extralegal [last word published in English] 
arrangements, and extraterritorial legislation by the Israeli 
Knesset, which annexed the settlements and converted them and 
their inhabitants into an integral part of the Israeli system, 
will remain intact. 
  The existing legal framework, therefore, will remain in 
force, except for powers "to promulgate legislation, including 
basic laws, laws, regulations, and other legislative acts," 
which have been transferred to the Palestinian authority, as 
long as those actions are acceptable to Israel, because if they 
are not, it has the right to annul them via a venerable body of 
judges, which will be authorized to approve the legislative acts 
only if they do "not seriously threaten other significant 
Israeli interests protected under this (Gaza-Jericho) agreement." 
  Only in one area is there no restriction on the 
Palestinians' 
authority: their responsibility for all the commitments and all 
the actions and slipups that took place prior to the transfer of 
powers. Israel will cease to bear financial responsibility for 
its acts and omissions during the years of occupation, and any 
claims against it will be sent to the Palestinian authority. 
Add to that the economic appendix, which leaves Israel in a 
dominant position, and Israel's ability to execute physical 
changes and unilaterally determine arrangements within the 
territory it holds, which will have a decisive impact on the two 
small enclaves, and the conclusion becomes absolutely clear: 
The Cairo agreement does not contain anything to prevent its 
adoption by all the political camps -- coalition and opposition 
alike. 
  All the glittering props -- uniforms, flags, passports, and 
stamps -- which irritated the right wing so much, cannot hide 
the fact that "Gaza and Jericho First" serves to legitimize the 
continuation of the status quo in its basic outlines. 
  It is difficult to say why Yasir 'Arafat gave in to all the 
Israeli demands. Was it due to his weakness, a lack of staff 
work, the purge of the "local" leaders who understand the 
situation, or does 'Arafat view the entire agreement with 
disdain and believe that reality will ground this entire legal 
set up? After all, all colonial occupation forces withdrew from 
the territories under their rule only after signing detailed 
agreements with the national liberation movements. But the 
agreements between the Americans and the Vietnamese, between the 
French and the Algerians, turned into nothing more than a dead 
letter because, from the start, they were merely meant to save 
face. That might turn out to be the situation here as well, but 
that optimistic forecast cannot deny the irony: The late Menahem 
Begin's autonomy plan will be implemented by a dovish peace 
government.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has 
confirmed reports concerning the downing of three aircraft of 
[word indistinct] type belonging to the al-Ahmar gang in the 
battles which were fought near Bab el Mandeb in the Red Sea, as 
well as the sinking of a gunboat near the shores of Aden. He 
said one of the pilots of these downed planes was alive and 
would confirm this fact himself, when his health allowed him to 
do so. 
  The command of the Naval Forces has confirmed reports 
concerning the sinking of a gunboat belonging to the bloody 
al-Ahmar gang by our courageous Navy, which is vigilant in 
protecting our territorial waters. 
  Commenting on statements by the so-called military source at 
the Defense Ministry under the al-Ahmar gang which, as usual, 
claimed that their forces were continuing their progress in the 
Kharaz area, the responsible source at the Defense Ministry 
confirmed that there was no truth in their reports, and that it 
was just part of the cheap media propaganda which the bloody 
al-Ahmar gang typically used. The source confirmed that our 
forces, the forces of unity, democracy, and modernism, had 
fought a rare defensive battle, in which they had resisted with 
courage and steadfastness the hordes of treachery and betrayal, 
and had inflicted heavy losses on those forces, forcing them to 
retreat and withdraw from where they had been pushed into the 
war by the adventurous al-Ahmar gang.

  [Text] The Yemeni News Agency correspondent in the al-Dali' 
district has reported the return of normal life to the city of 
al-Dali' and neighboring areas after the forces of 
constitutional legitimacy purged them of the forces misled by 
the secessionist elements in the Socialist Party. The 
correspondent said citizens resumed work and shops opened 
normally. 
  In another development, the [Yemeni Television] First 
Channel 
team shot pictures of the 'Abbud Camp area and other areas which 
were brought under the control of the constitutional legitimacy 
forces, including arms depots, tanks, and vehicles left behind 
by the fleeing forces misled by the elements of apostasy, 
rebellion, and secession. The news team interviewed citizens 
and fighters who joined the legitimacy forces. They expressed 
their pleasure that the forces of unity and legitimacy had 
managed to rid the area and its citizens of the hegemony of the 
forces of apostasy, rebellion, and secession and their divisive 
practices. 
  The brother citizens in the city of al-Dali' and neighboring 
areas appreciated the good treatment extended to them by the 
forces of legitimacy and unity, contrary to the falsehoods 
propagated by the secessionist elements in the Socialist Party. 
This good treatment proved that words are coupled by deeds by 
the legitimate leadership under brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
supreme commander of the Armed Forces, who instructed the Armed 
Forces to extend all possible assistance to the citizens in the 
region and protect their property in confirmation of the 
responsibility shouldered by the state of unity under his 
leadership for the sake of protecting the citizens throughout 
Yemen.

  [Excerpts] Sanaa, May 14 (AFP) -- Southern troops suffered 
"heavy losses" when northern forces recaptured the town of 
Musaymir, northwest of Aden, a spokesman for the Defense 
Ministry announced overnight Friday. 
  The report came as northern leaders rejected as "nothing 
new" 
a seven-point ceasefire plan put forward by their southern 
counterparts. 
  Northern troops advanced in the town of al-Dali', 90 
kilometers (55 miles) north of Aden, which controls one of the 
main routes to the former southern capital, SABA' news agency 
quoted him as saying. 
  Reports on the developments at al-Dali' were contradictory 
Friday, with each camp claiming control of the area. 
  The spokesman said southern forces also suffered heavy 
losses 
at Abyan where large amounts of weapons and ammunition, 
including 18 tanks and four armored vehicles, were seized. 
[passage omitted] 
  Arab League delegates carrying a message from the 
organization's Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid calling 
for an immediate halt to the civil war were due to meet with 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Saturday. 
  Friday's peace plan, proposed by the southern Yemen 
Socialist 
Party (YSP), called for an immediate end to the nine-day war and 
the creation of a national unity government. 
  But northern leaders repeated demands made at the beginning 
of the conflict for southern leaders to surrender.

<F P=106> [Statement by a Defense Ministry "official source"; place </F>
and date not given] 
  [Text] With support and help from God, the heroes of our 
valiant Armed Forces continued their confrontation of the forces 
of apostasy and secession in various axes and sectors and foiled 
all the hostile, treacherous goals of the criminal secessionist 
elements in the Socialist Party leadership and inflicted on them 
heavy losses in weapons, equipment, and vehicles and forced the 
deceived units to flee and surrender. 
  In the al-Dali' sector, the forces managed to proceed with 
steady steps forward. Our valiant, proud Armed Forces were able 
to return the center of Musaymir in Lahij Governorate to 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  On the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy were able to score tangible progress 
and chased the forces of the secessionist rebellious elements in 
the Aden garrison and forced them to retreat after inflicting 
heavy losses on them. 
  In the al-Mahfid District, units from the valiant Armed 
Forces were able to attack the forces of apostasy and secession 
from the Taysir Brigade and from the command of the Central Axis 
and seized 18 tanks, four 130-mm armored vehicles, one 122 [mm] 
Howitzer, one 85-mm gun as well as quantities of military 
ammunition and vehicles. 
  The forces of apostasy and secession from the Taysir Brigade 
and from the command of the Central Axis retreated to 
(al-Naqabah) in the Shabwah Governorate. This prompts us in 
this statement to underline the call of tolerance, sincere 
brotherhood, and the single affiliation to all comrades in arms 
in the military units that are still under the hegemony and 
tyranny of the secessionist, rebellious forces. We urge them to 
benefit from all the clear practical lessons that have taken 
place and are taking place in the fields of confrontation 
between the forces of evil, rebellion, and secession -- which 
ignited the war to serve their own selfish and detestable, 
suppressive party ambitions in order to fragment the homeland 
and rebel against constitutional legitimacy -- and the forces of 
good, right, and peace which rushed to defend unity and 
democracy and to protect the national sanctities, at the top of 
which is constitutional legitimacy, and to ensure respect for 
the Constitution, law, and the constitutional institutions, 
since this is a sacred duty that must be fulfilled by every 
soldier, noncommissioned officer [NCO], and officer of the armed 
and security forces; and by every citizen in any position. This 
makes us pin hopes on all the soldiers, NCO's, and officers, who 
are more able to reject the orders of the secessionist elements 
and return to the trenches of legitimacy and defend Yemeni unity 
because so doing is much easier than making themselves and their 
colleague face death and defeat. He who stands against the 
people's will, brings a rebellious force against the unity of 
the homeland, or seeks to fragment it and the defenseless 
citizens will be a loser. 
  O ye who believe; if you will aid the cause of God, he will 
aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]

  [Excerpts] Sanaa, May 14 (AFP)--A battle raged Saturday 
between rival army units in the strategic region of al-Dali' as 
hopes faded for Arab League mediators to secure a ceasefire in 
Yemen's civil war. 
  The north, rejecting a southern ceasefire plan, said troops 
loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih also captured the town 
of Musaymir, northwest of the south's stronghold of Aden. 
  The south had suffered "heavy losses." 
  In al-Dali', 90 kilometres (55 miles) down the road from the 
port city, northern forces were mopping up the last pockets of 
resistance and making further advances, Sanaa said. 
  Southern military officials said their warplanes were 
mounting raid after raid on the al-Dali' region, where 
correspondents saw seven northern soldiers dead on the side of 
the road, just five kilometres (three miles) from the village. 
  On Friday, the mountain village itself was almost deserted 
apart from southern soldiers, they said. Hundreds of residents 
have fled to Aden. 
  The two sides have not issued a casualty toll since the war 
erupted on May 5, although the north said Monday that 74 of its 
troops had been killed and more than 200 wounded. A Scud 
missile Wednesday on Sanaa claimed 25 more lives. 
  Clashes were also taking place in the Abyan region, east of 
Aden, but fighting had eased in Kharaz, on the coast 120 
kilometres (75 miles) to the west of the city. 
  The south has said the war between Salih's troops and the 
forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, was being waged on 
five fronts. 
  On the diplomatic front, an Arab League delegation has been 
here since Thursday waiting to see the president and deliver a 
call from the League's secretary general, Esmat Abdel Meguid, 
for an immediate ceasefire. 
  A northern spokesman in Sanaa said the meeting was finally 
likely to take place on Saturday. 
  But a source at the organisation's Cairo headquarters said 
the League was not expected to make any headway because both the 
south and north had toughened their positions. 
  The ruler of Bahrain, Amir 'Isa Bin-Sulayman Al Khalifah, 
Saturday joined the ceasefire calls and urged Yemen's rival 
leaders "to allow reason to prevail." [passage omitted on 
previously reported cease-fire proposal] 
  In the latest evacuation of foreigners, more than 200 
nationals of the former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow 
on a flight out of Moscow, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS 
said. 
  The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619 
Filipinos, 
including 40 children and six pregnant women, were still waiting 
evacuation from Yemen.

<F P=106> [Communique "No. 18" issued by the Ministry of Defense; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] For the 18th successive day the criminal and 
barbaric acts of the forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang have 
continued against our people and their armed forces. This is 
all part of the dirty war plan announced by the leader of that 
gang, the war criminal, the murderer of women, children, and the 
elderly; the supreme murderer of the armed forces, the terrorist 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in his ill-fated 27 April war speech. Our 
armed forces continue their heroic resistance in the face of the 
forces of treachery and betrayal which moved a huge force and 
equipment toward the former border areas and especially towards 
Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish. 
  Our armed forces managed yesterday and today not only to 
stop 
the advancing forces of the barbarous al-Ahmar gang in the 
directions of Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish but to 
force those forces to retreat and withdraw from their front line 
positions after inflicting heavy losses. We do not pride 
ourselves over victories or gloat over the losses of others by 
talking about the losses since the first and last losers in this 
war are the people and particularly the thousands pushed by the 
leader of the al-Ahmar gang like a herd of goats to the 
destructive slaughterhouse along the former dividing borders. 
However, we must commend the rare heroic spirit and the high 
morale of our armed and brave forces in al-Dali' and Karish. It 
is sufficient to say that an old veteran yesterday succeeded in 
destroying six hostile tanks in al-Dali' area. 
  If this shows anything, it shows the high spirit of morale 
of 
our armed forces who are inspired by the justice of the cause 
they are defending as a sacred cause with regard to the Yemeni 
people. This is the cause of dignity and the honor of women 
which the adventurous al-Ahmar gang is attempting to trample on 
with its tanks. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense 
has denied what was transmitted by Sanaa radio in its news 
bulletin of 3:00 PM this afternoon, that is, the forces of 
al-Ahmar gang had advanced towards al-Dali' and al-Anad and 
restored the al-Musaymir Center to legitimacy according to its 
claim. 
  The source added that the report transmitted by the said 
radio and attributed to a so-called responsible source in the 
Ministry of Defense about the advance of the forces of the 
al-Ahmar gang in many directions, was not based on any truth at 
all. It is just part of the psychological warfare and 
misleading media reporting. It is cheap lies to which the news 
media of the al-Ahmar gang had become accustomed. It is a gang 
headed by a man who is not restrained by anyone. [passage

  [Text] Field Colonel 'Ali al-Jayfi, commander of the 
northern Yemeni al-'Amaliqah Brigade, has said that his troops, 
backed with tanks and artillery units, are currently stationed 
at a distance of 40 km northeast of Aden, having inflicted 
successive defeats on the southern forces and overrun their 
strongholds in Abyan. 
  Speaking to an international media delegation touring the 
areas of the fighting, Col. al-Jayfi said that some northern 
troops have arrived at the al-'Alam area 20 km north of Aden. 
He pointed out that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih ordered the 
siege tightened on Aden, stronghold of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party. The northern commander added that his troops are 
repositioning themselves around the city and waiting for a 
political decision to capture it. 
  An official military source in Sanaa has said that the 
northern troops advanced in the al-Dali' sector and regained 
control of the southern al-Musaymir town.

not given] 
  [Text] With support from God, the heroes of the brave Armed 
Forces--the forces defending unity, consolidating constitutional 
legitimacy, and maintaining democratic and development 
achievements--continue their heroic, sacred mission of 
confronting the forces of rebellion, apostasy, secession, and 
plotting against unity. In all axes and sectors, our forces are 
waging a decisive confrontation against the dens of the 
separatist elements in the Socialist Party, inflicting heavy 
losses on the helpless forces' weapons and military hardware. 
They advanced on the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah and the 
al-Dali'-al-'Anad sectors, pounding the fortifications in front 
of the al-'Anad base. Our troops have gone past Jawl Madram, 
which is located in front of the al-'Anad base. 
  Meanwhile, the valiant, brave Armed Forces on the 
southwestern axis managed to advance dozens of kilometers from 
the Kharaz area eastward, heading toward the Salah-al-Din camp. 
They seized large quantities of hardware, vehicles, equipment, 
and a sea radar station. 
  The Air Force aircraft of the valiant Armed Forces managed 
to 
mount a successful attacks on a column of vehicles and equipment 
in the (al-Naqabah) area, the Shabwah Governorate, assembled by 
the apostate, secessionist forces from both the Hadhramaut and 
Shabwah Governorates. The aircraft returned safely to base. 
  The units of our Armed Forces in all axes and sectors 
received many of officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers who set themselves free from the grip and domination of 
the apostate, secessionist forces, joining the units of the 
forces of unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy, 
declaring their rejection of the secessionist, conspiratorial 
scheme and joining the units of our Armed and Security Forces to 
confront the enemies of the people, unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy. They stressed their condemnation of 
the bloody massacres that were planned and perpetrated by the 
secessionist gang in the Socialist Party.

<F P=106> [Statement by al-'Amaliqah Forces' Commander Colonel 'Ali </F>
al-Ja'ithi; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] From this area in the Abyan Governorate and from 
the al-'Amaliqah camp in the town of Zinjibar, I am happy to 
reassure our people and all our colleagues and brothers in the 
Armed Forces that the situation in the Abyan Governorate is 
stable and that our Armed Forces are completely in control of 
the governorate and that the Armed Forces units and al-'Amaliqah 
men are on the outskirts of Aden, only 15 to 20 km from Aden. 
The fighting is continuing with a great momentum and with high 
morale. What is rumored by the media of the secessionists, 
liars, and charlatans, the advocates of apostasy and secession, 
is baseless. Their units have been liquidated, whether in 
Abyan, the 20th Brigade, the Madram Brigade, or the [YSP] 
militia and party units here, as well as all of the units they 
sent to Abyan such as the 30th Brigade, the Unity Brigade 
dispatched from Hadhramaut, and the 5th Brigade that arrived 
from Aden. These units were confronted with firmness, faith, 
and with high morale and a great number of them were destroyed. 
  The enemy is being utterly defeated. Its defeat has been 
reflected in its psychology. It has now started to hit cities 
and civilians with missiles and artillery. We have avoided 
fighting in cities because we regard ourselves as protectors of 
people and citizens. We have avoided that in order to preserve 
citizen's lives and property. But the defeated and the confused 
ones choose civilians as their victims.

  [Text] Secessionist fortifications in the al-Dali' area 
were blown up the day before yesterday [14 May]. Their 
destruction was attended by a large number of people who 
announced their rejection of the despotic and secessionist gang 
that ruled tyrannically over the people of al-Dali' throughout 
the period of the abominable totalitarian rule. 
  Many people arrived in al-Dali' city declaring their support 
for the legitimate authority. They also declared that they were 
joining with the forces of constitutional legitimacy that have 
returned life to normal and provided them with all means of 
security and protection from any threat posed by the remnants of 
secession and apostasy, which have been completely uprooted from 
the region.

<F P=106> [Statement by Defense Ministry "responsible military </F>
source"; date not given] 
  [Text] With God's support and out of a firm belief in the 
victory of the people's will, the entrenching of justice, and 
the defeat of wrong in the battles of confrontation of the 
forces of rebellion, apostasy, and secession in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]; and to continue wiping out their dens and 
their collapsing fortifications, the brave heroes of our Armed 
Forces are completing their valiant tasks on the various axes 
and sectors. 
  On the Shabwah axis, our brave forces succeeded in 
destroying 
the advanced positions of the (?Madram) Brigade in Najd, Marqad, 
Jabal Bulayq, Jabal Shaqir, 'Ayn Hajar, and al-Saq. Our forces 
continue their advance to complete their tasks in the Bayhan 
District. Our forces captured several tanks, equipment, and 
military hardware while a large number of officers, NCO's, and 
soldiers from the (?Madram) Brigade joined the forces of unity 
and Constitutional legitimacy. 
  In the southwestern axis, the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah and 
al-Dali'-al- 'Anad sectors, the forces defending unity and 
legitimacy are waging fierce battles with all field guns. Our 
forces continue their intensive pounding of the al-'Anad Base 
fortifications after having purged the defensive pockets around 
it and forcing the defenders of the base to flee. Our forces 
continue to complete their missions in these two sectors. 
  In the same axis, our forces continued their advance to 
complete their set missions. They pursued the remnants of 
apostasy and secession in al-'Awadhil and al-Sha'ibi. The 
citizens turned out to meet the forces of unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy, chanting God is great, and cheering 
the victory over the remnants of secession and apostasy. 
  In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of apostasy and secession 
carried out an air raid on the Ja'ar area that sought to destroy 
the 7 October Factory and a number of the homes of citizens whom 
they had tried to terrify and annihilate in the past days with 
missiles. Their aggressive actions met with failure. That 
hysterical obsession led to the commission of criminal acts by 
targeting defenseless citizens and populated areas, firing a 
rocket the day before yesterday [14 May] at Sanaa. But God 
disappointed their bitter grudge and the rocket did not cause 
any damage. 
  Our Armed Forces are still receiving groups of officers, 
NCO's, and soldiers who are progressively joining the Armed 
Forces -- the forces of unity and democracy and the defense of 
constitutional legality. They thus declared their rejection of 
the separatist plot of the sinful gang within the Socialist 
Party, joining the side of the Armed Forces and Security Forces 
in defending unity and democracy and standing up to all the 
enemies of the people and the homeland. We applaud the high 
morale of the dignified Yemeni people who are rallying around 
their Armed Forces and Security Forces and their national role 
to destroy rebellion and the plot of secession. 
  We applaud all our people in the Lahij Governorate for their 
cooperation and support for their Armed Forces. We urge them 
and all the citizens in the Aden Governorate to feel reassured 
about this great national role of the lofty Armed Forces -- the 
forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, which protect 
them and their security and property, the forces protecting 
their stability, their present, and future. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If ye 
will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet 
firmly. [Koranic verses]

  [Text] Sanaa, 16 May (INA) -- Yemeni Army units yesterday 
advanced 30 km into Haraz region, around 65 km west of Aden, 
which they had captured last Thursday [12 May]. 
  The commander of the Khalid Bin-al-Walid Camp, operating 
with 
the Yemeni Command, told an INA correspondent in Sanaa -- who 
was with a press mission on a visit to the region organized by 
the Yemeni Information Ministry -- that the Khalid Bin-al-Walid 
and 'Urubah Brigades had inflicted huge losses on the 
secessionist troops, forcing them to retreat and surrender. 
  The commander said the 25th Mechanized Brigade, one of the 
strongest units of the secessionists, 50 km west of Aden, was 
among the secessionist troops that surrendered to the forces of 
legitimacy in the battles that erupted on 12 May. 
  Several Yemeni military commanders have asserted that a 
large 
number of citizens were supporting the forces of legitimacy 
against the remnants of the secessionists. 
  The Yemeni government's forces of legitimacy are advancing 
toward Aden, the secessionists' key stronghold, from the 
following axes: the Abyan-al-'Anad axis, from Abyan, al-Hawtah, 
and al-'Alam, 12-15 km east of Aden; from the northern axis, 
around 80 km from the al- 'Anad Base, which is around 60 km 
north of Aden; and from the west in the direction of the Aden 
garrison (Salah-al-Din Camp), which is around 15-50 km north and 
west of Aden in the direction of Bab el Mandeb. 
  Military sources say the fall of the al-'Anad Base will 
signal the collapse of the secessionists' main point of strength. 
  The forces of legitimacy are currently in control of regions 
4 km away from the al-'Anad Base, which is expected to fall 
within the next 24 hours, according to official Yemeni military 
sources.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council </F>
member and assistant YSP secretary general, by Salim Badawi; 
place and date not given; from the weekly "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] Following the eruption of battles in 
Sufyan and the 3d Brigade, the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] 
called for the formation of an inquiry commission. Regrettably, 
the incidents continued. The Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar was 
also attacked, after which the military situation exploded. We 
really regret the accusations. We also urge the stopping of 
this bleeding, this crushing war raging among the sons of the 
Yemeni people, which claims the lives of Yemen's sons. 
  [Badawi] Concerning the nature of war, Mr. Salim Salih 
Muhammad, the northern Yemenis claim that the fighting is taking 
place between the Constitutional legitimacy and the rebelling 
forces of the YSP leadership, as they put it. What is the YSP's 
viewpoint on the nature of the raging conflict? 
  [Muhammad] Are we not also part of the legitimacy? Have we 
not assumed power in light of the results of elections in the 
country? Are we not part of the Presidential Council, the 
Council of Ministers, the House of Representatives, and the 
other state institutions? We do not come from islands in the 
Pacific Ocean. We come from Yemen. We are Yemen's sons. We 
have been representatives of a state and a recognized legitimate 
power. We have achieved unity on an equal basis with our 
brothers in the north. Such claims do not render any service. 
In fact, they further exacerbate the conflict. Very 
regrettably, they also open a very deep wound in Yemeni unity 
and national unity. 
  [Badawi] The northerners' conditions for a cease-fire are 
represented by the YSP leadership's adherence to Constitutional 
legitimacy, and the submission to the legitimacy led by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, as they say. Are you willing to accept these 
conditions? What are your conditions, as the YSP, to stop 
fighting? 
  [Muhammad] The YSP has never proposed that 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih should be finished or go, or that the existing legitimacy, 
represented by the Presidential Council, the Council of 
Ministers, the Parliament, or the other existing state 
institutions, should go. However, he who has made the war 
decision, and who is waging it now against his sons, army, and 
people, to prove that he is the strongest and the triumphant, he 
is the one who will eventually lose history and the people. 
  [Badawi] What are your conditions for a cease-fire? 
  [Muhammad] We have no conditions other than actually 
beginning to implement the pledge and accord document, to 
recognize people's rights and duties, and to build the modern 
Yemeni state. Some sides believe the military option will give 
them the upper hand over everything, and enable them to 
establish their regime the way they want, in accordance with 
their own interpretations. Such a decision, I believe, is a 
crazy decision. The Yemeni Armed Forces and Yemeni 
installations are now being destroyed. Innocent people are 
being killed, the Yemeni people in Aden, Sanaa, al-Dali', Abyan, 
Shabwah, and Dhamar. These people are the victims of this crazy 
war which will not achieve the objectives of those who ignited 
the war. 
  [Badawi] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was quoted as saying 
that he wants to try 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his men, or to allow 
them to leave the country. What is your opinion about this? 
  [Muhammad] I have not heard such a thing. What I ask for 
now, from he who has reason and really wants to avoid further 
involvement in these crazy battles which, as I said, claim the 
lives of the sons of the Yemeni people, we ask them at this 
critical moments when the homeland is suffering from an ordeal 
and fragmentation, to stop the war immediately and resort to the 
language of dialogue, logic, and reason. 
  [Badawi] What about the dismissal decisions that affected 
senior southern officials, led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid? The 
northerners say that southern deputies participated in the 
voting sessions. Is that true? 
  [Muhammad] In your opinion, and in view of the current 
conditions, the state of emergency, and in view of the campaigns 
of physical liquidation we heard about in Sanaa, who would 
participate in such sessions? What kind of democratic, peaceful 
atmosphere would they have in a state of war? The world, the 
Arabs, and the Yemenis must understand what is going on in Yemen 
now. The situation is serious. It needs assistance from all 
our brothers and friends. 
  [Badawi] With regard to the rumors about appointing a 
successor to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and others in the central 
government in Sanaa, especially in the Presidential Council -- a 
probable candidate is rumored to be 'Ali Nasir Muhammad -- how 
do you view such reports? 
  [Muhammad] These issues are presented as bargaining chips in 
order to be used in haggling. In my opinion, the people have 
this right. The people gave their votes to their 
representatives in areas from which we came. These people have 
this right. 
  [Badawi] Now that the situation cannot be decided on the 
battlefield -- a week has passed since the outbreak of 
hostilities -- what are the chances that a return to dialogue 
will be effected and unity saved? 
  [Muhammad] There is no other way, regardless of the battles. 
The warring sides must eventually negotiate. I think that 
regardless of the harshness of the situation or the number of 
victims, we must preserve what is left and resort to the correct 
method, the method of dialogue, irrespective of differences. As 
for the war methods, regardless of their quick results, it will 
have very serious consequences in the future. It will not only 
cause wounds but will lead to a great suffering and moving the 
Yemeni people 30 to 40 years backward. 
  [Badawi] In your view, is it possible to save the unity? 
  [Muhammad] In my opinion, if the political will that was 
available when the unity was reached is still there, the answer 
is yes. However, judging by the methods that are being used in 
the battlefields and the vindictive way military personnel are 
dealing with unarmed civilians in towns and villages, deep 
wounds have been caused in national Yemeni unity. 
  [Badawi] Do you expect mediation, especially Arab mediation, 
to result in positive results, particularly in the foreseeable 
future? 
  [Muhammad] There is mediation and there are Arab efforts, 
but 
regrettably the brothers in Sanaa are rejecting all this. They 
believe the military solution is the ideal solution. This 
reading of the situation and of reality is tantamount to 
gambling. We wish them guidance from God. We wish they are 
guided to the right path. 
  [Badawi] In case Arab mediation fails, will you demand 
international intervention by the UN Security Council and the 
United Nations? 
  [Muhammad] So far, I have not been informed of any decisions 
from the brothers at home but we will consult on all 
possibilities, because everything is possible.

  [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] politburo has 
announced a political initiative aimed at ending the fighting in 
Yemen. The initiative includes eight [as heard] points: The 
question of the immediate cessation of the war is the first 
point of the initiative. 
  The second point provides for the formation of a national 
salvation government, which would attempt to eliminate the 
effects of the war. 
  The third point stresses the maintenance of what is left of 
the Armed Forces, as well as their reorganization, in addition 
to the disengagement of forces currently confronting each other. 
The attacking forces must be withdrawn to their former pre-war 
positions. 
  The fourth and fifth points of the initiative refer to the 
protection of the lives of the citizens and their possessions, 
and to fair compensation for those who have been harmed. The 
victims of the war, both civilian and military, should be 
regarded as martyrs. 
  Political and military detainees should be released. The 
detention, pursuit, or torture of any political or military 
elements should be prevented. Likewise, the looting of 
citizens' property should not be allowed. Looted goods should 
be restored to the owners, or those owners should be 
compensated. Parties' rights to exercise political activitity, 
in accordance with the Constitution and the law, should be 
recognized. 
  The seventh point [as heard, no mention of sixth point] 
stipulates that there should be no withdrawal from the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document. 
  The eighth point of the political initiative put forward by 
the YSP proposes that the national salvation government 
investigate those who caused the war and its declaration.

  [Text] Dubai, May 13 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni leaders 
rejected late Friday a southern ceasefire plan to end fighting 
which has opposed rival forces for the past nine days, and 
demanded the surrender of southern chiefs. 
  An official spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni 
capital Sanaa that there was "nothing new" in the seven-point 
plan put forward in Aden by the southern Yemen Socialist Party 
(YSP). 
  He said that "the legitimate leadership in Sanaa demands the 
surrender of the war criminal" ousted vice-president 'Ali Salim 
al- Bid, who heads the YSP. 
  They also wanted the surrender of "all the others 
responsible 
for the war, so that they can be judged for war crimes." 
  The plan put forward Friday by the YSP called for an 
"immediate end to the war" and the creation of a government of 
national unity. 
  The government would be charged with "wiping out the 
consequences of the war" and conducting an inquiry into "those 
responsible for the war," a source said in the southern 
stronghold of Aden.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Yemeni Socialist Party Politburo in </F>
Aden on 14 May] 
  [Text] O masses of our great Yemeni people, O living forces 
in Yemen, the Arab homeland and the world, to all those with 
consciences who reject war everywhere: The bloody influential 
gang in Sanaa has chosen war as a method of dealing with a 
political crisis which the country has witnessed for 11 days 
now. Days pass and the war continues to dispel the illusions of 
those who ignited it and believed that it would only last for 
some hours or two days at the most because of what the leaders 
of this war said at the time. The circle of destruction is 
widening as well as pain and suffering affecting our country and 
homeland all of which threaten the unity of the country and its 
stability. 
  Despite the appeals of the presidents and kings of the 
fraternal Arab countries and the leaders of many countries in 
the world, in addition to the pleas of international 
organizations and national leaders to stop this war and submit 
to the language of dialogue, the influential bloody gang in 
Sanaa disdainfully rejected them. This is because that 
bloodthirsty gang continues to ignore all those appeals and 
initiatives and boasts about its insistence to continue the 
march over a river of blood and over the skulls of soldiers and 
citizens [words indistinct]. 
  The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has shown a (?positive) 
response to the appeals and initiatives of brothers and friends 
to (?end) this war on the basis of rejecting the principle of 
force to settle differences. The YSP initiative announced 
yesterday (?calling) for the war to cease came from its 
realization of the gravity of bloodshed, the destruction of 
towns, installations and the armed forces. 
  When the YSP politburo rejects the war, and is concerned 
about ending the bloodletting of people and soldiers, and 
responds to the appeals and initiatives of the leaders of 
fraternal and friendly countries, it does so not because it is 
weak, but because it has a profound belief in the need to 
prevent Yemen from suffering the continuation of this 
destructive and bloody war which cannot be confined to a part of 
the shores and mountains of Yemen. Indeed, its flames will 
spread to include all the towns, shores, mountains and valleys 
of the homeland without any exception. 
  The YSP, as it responded to the appeals and initiatives of 
the leaders of states and fraternal and friendly governments who 
called for an end to the fighting, was fully aware that Arab 
countries, as well as the international community, would voice 
their stand with regard to those who refused to respond to the 
initiatives which embodied the realization of the leaders of 
fraternal and friendly countries about the necessity to stop 
this bloody war and its destructive effects on the unity and 
progress of Yemen. 
  Those who believed this war would end in hours or a few days 
and conducted themselves accordingly in the arrogant manner of 
invaders and conquerors, ought to realize well that this war 
will not end if they want to continue it. They will bear the 
historic responsibility and the high price which the people and 
the homeland will have to pay due to their insistence in 
continuing this war in which nobody will be the winner. 
  We appeal to all the good forces in Yemen and the 
neighboring 
countries, all the fraternal Arab and friendly countries and all 
those with consciences in the world to continue their efforts to 
convince the bloodthirsty to submit to reason and end the 
hysteria. 
  The politburo confirms that it rejects the war and welcomes 
all Arab and international initiatives and appeals to end it. 
It will not submit to the superciliousness and arrogance of 
those who insist to continue the war and destroy the unity of 
the country under the cover of legitimacy. Those who wish to 
continue to ignore the appeals of reason and conscience and the 
necessity to stop this war must bear the responsibility of 
continued bloodshed, banishment of families, destruction of 
towns, killing of innocents, and the destruction of the Armed 
Forces. They must realize that if they have opted for war as a 
means of imposing hegemony and annexation and if they also opt 
to ignore the initiatives and appeals of the good forces which 
reject the war in Yemen, the Arab homeland, and the world, they 
will not be able to choose a definite place for this war and 
impose it on us. When war is ignited, it burns where it wills. 
When the spark of war is not extinguished, then that spark will 
change to fire and ultimately hell. Those who have committed 
injustice will get their just rewards. God has spoken the truth.

  [Text] A visiting Arab League delegation, led by Major 
General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, the Arab League assistant 
secretary general for military affairs, this afternoon visited 
the site where a missile exploded. The missile was fired by the 
secessionist, rebellious gang of the Socialist Party last 
Tuesday [10 May] on a densely populated quarter of the capital, 
Sanaa. 
  The Arab League delegation saw the destruction caused by the 
missile's explosion over the citizens' homes which fell over the 
heads of their residents. They also saw the damage caused to 
many neighboring houses. 
  The delegation listened to citizens on the material and 
human 
losses sustained in the explosion, which claimed the lives of 23 
martyrs and left dozens others injured. This is in addition to 
the panic caused for women, children, and old people who were 
asleep the moment the missile of the secessionists exploded in 
the capital of the unity state, targeting the lives of secure 
civilians.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the 
Presidential Council, has received the Arab League delegation 
led by brother Major General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant 
secretary general for military affairs. The Arab League 
delegation is currently on a visit to our country. 
  The member of the Presidential Council received a message 
addressed to brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, from Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on the current developments in 
our country. The message expresses the Arab League's concern to 
maintain Yemeni unity as a Yemeni national gain and a pan-Arab 
achievement from which there must be no retreat. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani affirmed to the Arab 
League delegation that the rebellious faction in the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP], which provoked the military situation, 
despite the exhausting efforts and many concessions made to the 
YSP to avoid military confrontation. However, the misguided 
faction continued with its stubbornness and dragged the country 
into the current situation. He stressed that the Yemeni 
leadership is keen to end the fighting by adhering to 
Constitutional legitimacy and its Constitutional and executive 
institutions as well as by sticking to the results of the 
parliamentary elections held on 27 April 1993. 
  The member of the Presidential Council also expressed our 
country's appreciation of the Arab League's concern about what 
is happening in our country, for which the rebellious factions 
in the YSP leadership are held responsible. He added that 
Yemeni unity represents a great gain for our Yemeni people, who 
will defend and protect themselves from any plotting concocted 
by the rebellious faction in the YSP leadership, whose grudge 
against our people and their people made them shell the capital, 
Sanaa, and other Yemeni cities with Scud missiles. He said: 
The determination of our people to defend unity and democracy 
cannot be shaken by these desperate criminal attempts.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi 
yesterday received an Arab League delegation led by Major 
General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant secretary general 
for military affairs. The Arab League delegation is currently on 
a visit to our country. 
  The two sides reviewed the developments in our country in 
light of the war ignited in the homeland by the gang of apostasy 
and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. 
  The deputy prime minister explained the developments in the 
Yemeni arena, holding the secessionist rebellious leadership of 
the YSP responsible for igniting the military situation in the 
country. He noted that this took place in accordance with a 
premeditated scheme and began with the actions of this gang, 
which is rebelling against political legitimacy by violating the 
framework of the government coalition, paralyzing the legitimate 
institutions, casting doubts about them, and obstructing their 
role. 
  The deputy prime minister expressed his appreciation for the 
Arab League's role in shouldering its pan-Arab responsibility to 
protect Yemeni unity, which is considered a pan-Arab achievement 
that concerns all the sons of the Arab nation, and to support 
justice and constitutional legitimacy.

  [Text] The Council of Coordination Between Parties and the 
Masses, Organizations, and Nationalist Citizens in Aden 
Governorate has sent a telegram to brother Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Arab League. The 
telegram calls on the secretary general and the Arab member 
states to intervene, directly, effectively, and quickly in order 
to halt the fighting between the Yemeni military forces and 
secure towns and citizens from any acts of aggression. Also, it 
asks the League to pave the way for the political forces to hold 
dialogues about the implementation of the document of pledge and 
accord, considering that that document is the sole solution, and 
to seek a new formula for unity. 
  The telegram said it was necessary for the Council of 
Coordination to address this direct call to the secretary 
general of the Arab League at a time when Yemeni weapons were 
being pointed at other Yemenis and when Yemen was being 
destroyed and its people exterminated after the achievement of 
unity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
To the sincere sons of our Yemeni people in Aden, the economic 
and trade capital. To those who defeated colonialism and upheld 
the values of truth, justice, and equality. To those who have 
been afflicted by the gang of a new brand of party dictatorship 
and by the elements of the clique of repression, apostasy, and 
secession. To the faithful ones who fight and struggled for a 
free Yemeni life but reaped instead slavery, oppression, and 
tyranny and paid a high price for the worst and most horrible 
Marxist and atheist experiment, which spread repression, 
nationalized property, and confiscated rights and liberties and 
forced on the good elements, even in the Socialist Party itself, 
ideological estrangement, homelessness, and harassment. 
  To those who offered dozens of relatives as sacrifices to 
end 
the nightmare of the militias and to escape the massacres of the 
killers in the Socialist Party leadership for over 27 years of 
totalitarian regime, which severed the sinews of love between 
one brother and another, and between father and son, and 
destroyed the bridges of trust among the groups of society and 
shook people's confidence in themselves and in their ability to 
get rid of the party's shackles, of its rabid dogs, and the 
torture in its dungeons. 
  To the free Yemeni people in the brave city of 
Aden--military 
and civilian, shopkeepers and laborers, men and women, boys and 
girls. To those who were at the forefront of the masses who on 
22 May 1990 shouted long live the unity, and raised the banner 
of unity and democracy, and wiped out the partition and its 
deplorable remnants. 
  To the fathers, brothers and sons; to the mothers and 
sisters, we ask you to take a firm, unwavering stand against the 
barbaric trap that has been set for you by the secessionist 
elements in the Socialist Party. Beware of them and know that 
the Armed Forces and security forces are your own forces, the 
forces of constitutional legitimacy, the protectors of unity and 
democracy. Therefore, these forces are to be trusted in caring 
for your life, security, and stability because they are 
responsible for the life of the entire people. Therefore, we 
are confident that you will always be with them, especially 
today when they are embarking on the heroic path and confronting 
the latest chapter in the plot of the secessionist gang, which 
the is taking of the tranquil life in Aden as a trench to 
protect it from the just punishment of heaven and from people's 
will. This gang is endeavoring to drag the Yemeni Armed Forces 
into storming this trench at the expense of your security and 
stability, a thing which this gang failed to realize, thanks to 
the astuteness of the political leadership of brother Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential 
Council and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, who has 
been issuing firm instructions to the Armed Forces' brave 
brigades and battalions and to the splendid men of the 
homeland's protectors that they should not be dragged into the 
plot prepared by the sanguinary elements of the Socialist Party, 
which aim to destroy the proud city of Aden in the wake of their 
utter and expected defeat. 
  O free brothers, you are aware of the secessionist gang's 
hatred toward Aden and its inhabitants. You are aware that this 
sanguinary plot is an extension of the policy of destruction 
that the Socialist Party devils led on 13 January 1986. That is 
why we appeal to you to take the initiative, foil the plot, and 
join the trench of defending unity and democracy under the 
fluttering banner of constitutional legitimacy, and to face the 
secessionist gangs firmly, bravely, with conviction, and with an 
unwavering stand. 
  We appeal to you to rob all those who rebel against 
constitutional legitimacy at any opportunity and to extend all 
kinds of support and backing to your heroic sons of the Yemeni 
Armed Forces, who will uproot the elements of apostasy and 
secession with God's backing and your support. They will 
eliminate those who endanger the homeland and bargain at the 
expense of the supreme people's interests. 
  O free brothers, let the people's will, which is the will of 
justice, proceed with daring, strength, and capability. Let 
your cry roar and let us work together along the same path to 
save the unionist city of Aden from the secessionist plot so 
that it will remain safe and free and an honorable landmark of 
the new Yemeni homeland, which now belongs to the procession of 
the free world, thanks to its unity and democracy. 
  Accursed be the plotters, the enemies of God and the people, 
the enemies of unity and democracy, and the enemies of life and 
democracy.

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Ibrahim Humaydi, and Ashraf </F>
al-Faqiyy: "Sanaa Announces Capture of al-Dali'; Aden Announces 
Recapture of Zanjibar"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Damascus, Cairo -- Yemen witnessed 
fierce fighting between its two armies yesterday. Sanaa 
announced yesterday that its forces have moved into the 
strategic city of al-Dali', while Aden stressed that its forces 
have recaptured Zanjibar, capital of Abyan Governorate, from the 
northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade. 
  Aden denied that northern forces have seized al-Dali', a 
stronghold for a large number of southern army commanders. 
However, neutral sources have told AL-HAYAH that it seems that 
northerners have made advances in al-Dali', and that fierce 
fighting is taking place in the directorate. With regard to 
Zanjibar, the sources say they can confirm Aden's information in 
this connection. 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad has issued a strongly 
worded statement in Damascus, stressing his "willingness to 
return to Yemen to mediate between the Yemeni leadership parties 
in order to safeguard unity." He denied the existence of any 
link between him and "the political bases agreed between the two 
partners (the Socialist Party and the General People's 
Congress)." [passage omitted] 
  Responding to accusations leveled at him, he said: "I am not 
a party to the disputes tearing Yemen apart. My full support is 
for Yemen, its unity, and national unity." He added: "I am 
proud of my supporters wherever they are. They will serve 
nothing except the issue of unity, for the sake of which they 
have made sacrifices. And they will struggle to safeguard it." 
  He said that what is happening in Yemen does not help the 
two 
sides to engage in calm negotiations. "However, it is not the 
end of the road yet for the negotiations, an understanding, and 
national reconciliation, despite the ferocity of the fighting 
there." He pointed out that he has done "a great deal and I am 
still willing to play a constructive role between the two 
parties to the conflict in order to secure a solution that 
safeguards the Yemenis' unity, spares them the calamities of war 
and destruction, and spares Yemeni blood." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo--In exclusive statements to AL-ITTIHAD, 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, former Yemeni foreign minister and head 
of the Political Directorate of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], stressed that he informed Arab League Secretary General 
'Ismat 'Abd- al-Majid yesterday that 'Ali Salim al-Bid accepts 
any measures the Arab League and the Arab countries will take to 
stop the war in Yemen. He also said that interest in stopping 
the war is not considered interference in his country's internal 
affairs. He also underlined that the YSP has no intention of 
seceding and denied that foreign parties were behind the start 
of the fighting. 
  Al-Dali said the problem is that there is a party that does 
not want to implement the first part of the pledge and accord 
document which concerns the security and military situation.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with dismissed Prime Minister Haydar </F>
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, in Washington, by unidentified 
correspondent; date not given; from the "Weekly File" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-'Attas] What is taking place in Yemen is a 
tragedy. The war raging there does not serve any of the Yemeni 
people's interests. Political differences should not have led 
to such a fierce war. This is hurting our people in Yemen and 
all their interests. We warned against this. And, refraining 
from violence or the use of force to deal with disputes was 
consecrated as a principle at the beginning of the political 
dialogue during the crisis. Therefore, the situation is 
difficult and tragic, and against the Yemeni people's interests, 
against their unity, against all the bonds of brotherhood, and 
against their economy. Therefore, we are trying by all means to 
stop this war and return to the voice of logic and to a dialogue 
of reason and conscience. 
  [correspondent] What about the pledge and accord document 
signed in Amman? 
  [Al-'Attas] One of the aims of the war, in my opinion, is to 
contain, circumvent, and renounce this document. It is very 
obvious that any military action to deal with the crisis will be 
intended to stop dialogue and sound treatment of the crisis, as 
stated in the pledge and accord document. 
  [correspondent] What, Mr. Prime Minister, do you think of 
current Arab mediation efforts? 
  [Al-'Attas] I think the Arab nation has a very large 
pan-Arab 
responsibility to adopt responsible positions to stop the 
bleeding in Yemen and to push all the parties toward responsible 
dialogue in order to address the current political problems in 
the country, which coincided with the establishment of Yemeni 
unity in May 1990. We pinned hopes, and we continue to pin 
hopes, on Arab efforts, particularly the Syrian and Egyptian 
efforts, as well as those of other Arab countries represented by 
the Arab League. 
  [correspondent] What about the decisions taken by the 
leadership in the north to depose several officials? 
  [Al-'Attas] These are illegitimate unconstitutional, and 
secessionist decisions. They cannot resolve the problem 
correctly and peacefully. All the decisions by the House of 
Representatives and other bodies mean nothing. They only 
underscore the desire of the warmongers and the continuation of 
this war in Yemen. Once again, I stress that war is against 
Yemeni interests and against the interests of the Yemeni 
homeland. Therefore, such decisions are meant to sever all ties 
and all economic channels. I would like to reiterate that they 
are illegitimate and meaningless. 
  [correspondent] There is also a question abouit the future 
of 
Yemeni unity. What can you say about this unity? 
  [Al-'Attas] No doubt, it is in danger. War means work 
against unity. We have repeatedly drawn attention to this. We 
said resorting to war would mean acting against unity and 
against the wishes of the Yemeni people. Unity cannot be 
achieved by war or by military victory. I hope the leadership 
of the Yemeni people will stop this bloodshed and return to the 
language of dialogue and logic and to the language of reason, 
not emotions and desires. This is the path that can guide all 
Yemenis to the best method to address the problem and the 
current political situation in Yemen and find practical 
solutions to them.

  [Text] Brother Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, the minister 
of oil and mineral resources, has confirmed that Yemeni oil 
production and (?refining) operations have not been affected, in 
spite of the violent fighting going on in our country. Brother 
Bin-Husaynun, who is currently visiting a number of Arab 
capitals, said that the production of oil from the Ma'rib, 
Shabwah, and Hadramawt fields was proceeding normally, and that 
the oil installations have not been subjected to any attacks. 
He pointed out that defense precautions had been taken to 
prevent sabotage operations and repulse any attacks. 
  He said that oil was a resource belonging to all the Yemeni 
people. The forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang should avoid any 
attacks on these installations.

  [Text] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council 
member and assistant YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] secretary 
general, said that the option for peace, for dialogue, for 
sitting at a roundtable to discuss the entire situation, was the 
only way to settle the current crisis. 
  He said that the YSP, which had led the moves for unity and 
democracy, had neither planned nor even thought of resorting to 
a military approach. Brother Salim Salih Muhammad added, in a 
radio interview with him today with the Netherlands 
international radio, that the readiness of the Armed Forces had 
been destroyed over the last four years. There were also 
various assassinations of YSP leaders, cadres, and members. It 
was the other side which was driving the country into the 
inferno of this destructive war. The only real loser would be 
the Yemeni people. 
  He pointed out that the Yemeni people -- from one end of the 
country to the other -- their brothers in the Arab homeland, and 
their friends worldwide, demanded an immediate cessation to the 
fighting, which was destroying the resources of Yemen, its 
military establishment, and all the other facilities which they 
had been building over the last thirty years. 
  Moreover, the war was inflicting a fatal wound to the body 
of 
national unity built four years ago. The brother member of the 
Presidential Council said that the ideal option of imposing 
unity could not be effected without conviction. People should 
come to unity voluntarily, not by force, by the pounding of 
villages and towns, or by genocide. He demanded an immediate 
end to the fighting and the beginning of a dialogue. All issues 
should be tabled for discussion. By these means we can arrive 
at solutions satisfactory to the Yemeni people, their brothers, 
and their friends.

to this destructive war. 
  The Yemeni vice president welcomed any dialogue that spares 
the country the woes of war and further bloodshed, maintains 
unity, and prevents partition.

  [Text] A responsible official source has rebutted the lies 
and fabrications 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the war criminal, the leader 
of the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] command, and the killer of children and women in 
defenseless cities, made at a news conference the day before 
yesterday. The source emphasized that everything he said is the 
figment of the imagination of a man who has been overwhelmed by 
the thirst for absolute power since the era of the one-party 
dictatorship and a man who is fond of statements that emanate 
from the complex of leadership and abhorrent megalomania. 
  The source explained that it is uprising and ironic that the 
deposed al-Bid speaks about legitimacy and delivers legal 
opinions about it, he who has been divested of legitimacy after 
he refused to comply with the people's will and accept the 
results of the legislative elections on 27 April 1993, to be 
sworn in before the House of Representatives as vice chairman of 
the Presidential Council, and to respect this constitutional 
body. He is well aware that this position was given to him 
although the constitution does not provide for such a position. 
He also insisted on being given this title in the news, despite 
of the fact that he had not taken the constitutional oath. The 
YSP also assumed the third position on the Presidential Council 
in accordance with the results of the elections on 27 April 
1993, in which the YSP won 56 seats, coming third after the 
General People's Congress [GPC], which came in first, and the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping, which in came second. 
  In spite of this, the GPC gave up its right to three seats 
on 
the Presidential Council in accordance with the elections 
results and gave the YSP two seats on the Council. The GPC also 
agreed to give al-Bid the position of vice chairman out of 
concern for national interests and national accord and to avoid 
any exacerbation of the crisis that al-Bid started with his 
return to Aden on 19 August 1993. 
  It is strange that al-Bid speaks about the legitimacy of the 
others, who enjoy full legitimacy and who were elected by the 
constitutional establishment as representatives of the entire 
Yemeni people out of their free will, which they translated 
through the legislative elections. This butcher continues to 
call himself vice chairman of the Presidential Council knowing 
full well that he is not legitimate because he has violated the 
Constitution and has not taken the constitutional oath and 
because such a position is not provided for in the Constitution. 
  The source explained that al-Bid was the first to circumvent 
democracy and party pluralism when he refused to comply with the 
people's will and did not accept the results of the elections. 
  The source added that the criminal butcher al-Bid goes so 
far in his lies and falsification of facts as to deny the 
indiscriminate use of weapons of mass destruction -- long-range 
missiles -- to hit secure civilians in Sanaa, Ta'izz, 
al-Hudaydah, al-Rahidah and other cities in the republic. As a 
result of this odious crime and treacherous, brutal act of 
aggression, many innocent civilians among the elderly, children, 
and women were killed and many houses and civilian installations 
were destroyed. We do not know what the butcher al-Bid can say 
about those innocent victims who were killed under the debris of 
the houses destroyed by the missile that he and his gang fired 
on 11 May. Nor do we know what al-Bid can say about his missile 
that landed on the al-Rahidah hospital, killing many patients 
lying on their beds in the hospital, or what this butcher and 
his clique can say about his media trumpets' haughty, conceited, 
and insane appeals and threats to fire more missiles into cities 
to intimidate citizens who have been terrorized by the rancorous 
missiles that poured down over their heads while they were 
sleeping in their homes. 
  The source added that al-Bid is shamelessly lying and 
continues to lie, believing that he can deceive others. He is a 
psychologically disturbed person suffering from a state of 
psychological, political, and media schizophrenia, with his 
words constantly contradicting his acts. Because of this 
illness, the butcher al-Bid triggered the war in Yemen and mired 
the Yemeni people in a cycle of bloody fighting to peddle his 
secessionist plan, the features of which have begun to become 
clear since he ignited the crisis on 19 August 1993, the 
subsequent steps of the military explosion, and then the 
starting of the war. This plan started on the eve of the 
signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman. Then, 
military units were moved from Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and Aden to 
besiege and destroy al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan. Afterward, 
they fomented sedition in (Harf) Sufyan, the Shabwah 
Governorate, 'Imran, and Dhamar, and attacked central security 
personnel in Aden and the personnel of the 2d Armored Brigade in 
al- Rahah, Lahij. 
  The source explains that this criminal butcher and his 
secessionist clique would do well to leave the homeland or 
surrender themselves for fair trial so as to spare our Yemeni 
people further bloodshed and suffering and the homeland further 
destruction. The source stressed that our Yemeni people and 
public opinion abroad have become fully aware of the reality of 
al-Bid and his rebellious, secessionist gang and their lies and 
fabrications, which cannot fool anyone anymore.

  [Text] The parliamentary bloc of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] and its friends in the Council of Representatives has 
stated that constitutional legitimacy is an integrated system 
which means a rigorous and strict application of the 
constitution and laws enforced by bodies, organs, and 
institutions of the state. Therefore, the decisions issued by 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are regarded as a clear and blatant 
violation of the Constitution because they were not issued in 
accordance with the rigorous provisions made by the Constitution 
of the Yemeni Republic. 
  In a statement issued yesterday, the parliamentary bloc 
emphasized that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's declaration of the state 
of emergency is regarded as null and illegal because such a 
declaration requires the existence of a special law that 
regulates and explains the declaration of the state of emergency 
and its circumstances on the basis of Article 94, paragraph 17 
and Article 97 of the Constitution. 
  The parliamentary bloc of the YSP condemned the spiteful 
raids against the YSP's centers and the pursuit and detention of 
YSP and other political parties and organizations' leaders and 
members, currently being carried out by state bodies controlled 
by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his secessionist executive military 
family. The YSP parliamentary bloc called on the Arab League 
and all brothers and friends to exert their generous efforts to 
stop the war immediately and rescue the homeland from 
destruction to which it is currently exposed. It stated that 
there is in the YSP initiative a truly correct and appropriate 
solution to save the homeland and preserve the unity of the 
territory and its people.

  [Text] The Yemeni Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has denounced 
the use of destructive weapons and the shelling of secure 
villages and cities by missiles, inflicting heavy human losses. 
This is in addition to the material and moral damage involved. 
  The party said innocent citizens killed in secure 
residential 
quarters and villages are the victims of secessionist disputes 
and selfish interests that govern the conduct of those who 
showed no seriousness and credibility toward the crisis. 
  The party reiterated its adherence to, and support for, 
unity 
by all legitimate Constitutional means since it is more 
important and precious than any other objective in its struggle 
and existence. 
  The party said it will spare no effort to protect unity. It 
strongly rejected any reasoning and conduct that harms unity. 
The party said now that blood has been shed, bodies have been 
torn apart, and children, women and old people have been 
terrorized, the required position should be to show concern 
about the suffering of the homeland and transcend narrow, 
conflicting whims and interests that distort the homeland and 
destroy the deep-rooted values and meanings that associate the 
Yemenis with the Constitutional institution, avoiding regional 
and sectarian loyalties. 
  The statement of the Ba'th Party in Yemen, addressed today 
to 
the masses of the Yemeni people, reasserted the party's 
rejection of any Arab or foreign intervention under the pretext 
of disengaging the warring troops, stressing that this is an 
internal question.

  [Text] At the request of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdalllah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
supreme commander of the Armed Forces, Muhammad Hasan Dammaz, 
minister of local administration, today visited al-Dali' 
District, which has been purged of the Yemeni Socialist Party's 
renegade and secessionist clique. The minister attended a large 
rally in the city of al-Dali' and addressed crowds from the 
district. 
  At the beginning, he conveyed the greetings of brother 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
as well as his wishes and congratulations to them and to our 
Yemeni people on the victory over the renegade and secessionist 
clique. He said this great victory was achieved thanks to God 
and the will of our people and all honorable unionists 
everywhere in the Republic of Yemen. He said this victory which 
you have achieved made us and every Yemeni citizen proud. He 
said that purging the al-Dali' District, as well as the victory 
achieved by the heroes of the Armed Forces in it, has restored 
the people's confidence in themselves and in their unity. 
  The city of al-Dali', he said, is the city of heroic deeds 
and bravery and the gate of victory that will correct the course 
of unity, which will be devoid of factionalism, sectarianism, 
cronyism, or regionalism, and which is considered a victory from 
almighty God and a victory of right over wrong. He urged all 
the sons of the district and all those who left it to return to 
their families. He said the state and its leaders will protect 
them, provide security for them, and take care of them, 
stressing that no harm will come to them. This is, he said, a 
promise from Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
and from all officials in the Presidential Council, the 
government, and the leadership. 
  He said that the state and Lt. Gen. brother 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih have issued their instructions to implement an electricity 
and water project in the city of al-Dali', stressing that the 
project will be implemented immediately. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Qadir 'Ali Hilal, deputy governor of the Ibb 
Governorate, also delivered a speech to the crowds, hailing the 
steadfastness of the heroic sons of al-Dali' District, their 
support for Constitutional legitimacy, their defense of unity 
and democracy, their efforts to entrench the state of order and 
law, and their effective participation in defeating the forces 
of renegade and secession. He added that the brother leader 
president had asked him to form several committees to register 
the names of the martyrs and the wounded and the names of those 
whose houses were destroyed by the forces of renegade and 
secession. This, he said, will take place quickly in order to 
ease the suffering of the sons of the district, who faced 
disasters at the hands of secessionists before the restoration 
of the Yemeni Unity and during the years that followed it, 
stressing that victory is for our people, our revolution, and 
our unity, and that defeat is for the secessionists. The rally 
was attended by Ibb Commander Colonel Muhammad Ahmad al- 
Zayyani, al-Dali' District head Muhammad Isma'il Muqbil, and 
several officials from A'tabah and (?Dimzah) districts. 
  The minister of local administration met with the commanders 
of the military units and officials in the al-Dali' District and 
discussed with them various issues of interest to the district 
and its sons. He also inspected (?Dimz) District, met officials 
from it, and listened to a number of supply and educational 
issues of interest to the citizens. Several officials from the 
district attended.

  [Text] The higher committee charged with preparing for the 
festivals marking the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni Republic 
met this morning under brother Deputy Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Wahhab al- Anisi. During this meeting, the conferees 
discussed the timetable for the celebrations of the Republic's 
national day, the fourth anniversary of unity and the 
establishment of the Yemen Republic. 
  Despite the difficult circumstances brought about by the 
gang 
of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party, the committee 
decided to hold festivals to mark this dear anniversary in all 
governorates in the country; the anniversary of the day on which 
our people's dream and great goal -- the restoration of unity 
and the establishment of the Yemeni Republic -- was achieved on 
22 May 1990.

  [Text] Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the 
House of Representatives speaker, today held a news conference 
attended by local, Arab, and foreign correspondents. 
  In this news conference, which was held at the House of 
Representatives, the brother House speaker explained that his 
recent visit to fraternal Saudi Arabia was a normal visit that 
falls within the framework of the understanding and ties between 
the two fraternal countries. These ties, he said, are eternal 
and strong. We must all exchange views on issues that are of 
interest to the region. He added: The visit also aimed at 
explaining developments to the brothers in Saudi Arabia. We 
found that Saudi Arabia and the other fraternal Arab states 
support legitimacy. 
  Asked if the House decision to remove al-Bid's legitimacy 
and 
suspend [Prime Minister] al-'Attas came late and if it should 
have been taken at the start of the crisis, Shaykh al-Ahmar 
said: As regards 'Ali Salim, he does not enjoy legitimacy 
because he did not take the oath before the House of 
Representatives. He defied the House. The House took the 
appropriate Constitutional decision. As regards Haydar 
al-'Attas, he was given the vote of confidence to implement the 
government statement. He asked for a period of few months to 
implement the statement. He, however, did not fulfill his 
promise and continued to procrastinate, after the House made 
several requests to him and after his government failed to 
implement what it pledged. As for the delay, it stemmed from 
the House's concern to contain the crisis fabricated by 'Ali 
Salim and his gang. All the forces continued to work to contain 
it, but he continued to escalate the crisis to the level of a 
military explosion and then the House had to take that position. 
  The House speaker added: Within that context, and after the 
rebels ignited the war, the House position is supportive of the 
head of state and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces and 
the forces of the people, which are the forces of legitimacy. 
This is natural in such circumstances. 
  He noted that the formation of a new government is a 
prerogative of the Presidential Council chairman.

  [Excerpt] Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
the House of Representatives speaker, has stressed that the 
House has no reservations whatsoever about the Yemeni Socialist 
Party and its activities in the Yemeni arena, but the House 
stands against the rebels in the party's leadership. He 
explained that members of the Socialist Party are still 
performing their activities inn the House of Representatives. 
  This emerged in the news conference the brother House of 
Representatives Speaker held today, 15 May, which marks the 
passage of one year since the first session of the elected House 
of Representatives and the election of its speakership office. 
He said this is a dear occasion [words indistinct] embodied in 
27 April 1993 through which the legitimate and Constitutional 
institutions were born. He stressed that all of this was the 
product of democracy in which we believe and to which we adhere, 
regardless of attempts by those who are trying to circumvent the 
results of the elections. He said our Yemeni people adhere to 
unity and democracy because this is their fate and future, and 
because they emanate from Islam. Therefore, he said, they will 
stand by them and protect them against all secessionists. 
  The brother House of Representatives speaker explained that 
Saudi Arabia and other fraternal and friendly states support 
legitimacy and view the issue as one between the state and 
rebels. He noted that this does not mean they (?hesitate) to 
exert efforts, individually and through the Arab League. He 
said his visit to Saudi Arabia yielded good results and that the 
ties between the two countries are eternal and strong. 
Therefore, we have to exchange views with our brothers to put 
them in the picture. Additionally, the visit fell within the 
context of strengthening and activating these ties. 
  He explained the interaction by Arab capitals, both near and 
far, with the events in the Yemeni arena emanates from the 
brotherly (?ties) and the desire to stop this bloodshed. 
  The brother House of Representatives Speaker praised the 
stand of all Arab brothers who exerted and are exerting efforts 
and are showing concern for [words indistinct] the efforts of 
King Husayn and his great and effective roles to contain the 
crisis since it started. The king's position, al-Ahmar said, 
was the position of the brother who is concerned about his 
brothers. [passage omitted; covered in referent item and 
containing indistinct words]

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, YSP Political Bureau </F>
member and official in charge of foreign relations, by Salah 
Salamah; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau member and official in 
charge of foreign relations in the party, the recent reports 
about the battles say that the northern units of the Yemeni army 
are now 20 km away from Aden and that they continue to advance 
toward the country's economic capital. How true are these 
reports? How do you assess the situation on the ground? 
  [Al-Dali] It has become clear that Sanaa has been 
transmitting lies since the very first day these battles began. 
You followed with me the news that Sanaa has been transmitting 
over the past 10 days, that they are 3 km away, 6 km, and 10 
km, then they went back and said 20 km. The truth is that 
these are all lies by which they seek to boost their morale in 
order to prevent popular upheaval in wake of the big defeats 
they have sustained over the last 10 days. Now, fighting is 
raging on the borders between the former two parts of the 
homeland. The situation is very good in Abyan, and also [word 
indistinct] in al-Dali.' 
  [Salamah] Have you recaptured al-Dali' city? 
  [Al-Dali] Yes, yes. We recaptured it yesterday and [words 
indistinct] settled in our favor, and the al-'Amaliqah elements 
are being liquidated. They have entered houses, (?plundered] 
villages and valleys [indisdtinct word] in Abyan. 
  [Salamah] The central command in Sanaa seems to be set on a 
military solution and seeks, as it says, to arrest the leaders 
of the south, after describing them as the advocates of apostasy 
and secession, with Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid at their 
head. Do you believe it is still possible to resort to dialogue 
to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen? 
  [Al-Dali] I say that political dialogue is a sine qua non, 
no 
matter how intense the fighting becomes. In the end, there will 
be no other choice but to hold a dialogue. The military 
settlement about which they have spoken so much has reached a 
dead end. There is no other course open to them but to [words 
indisintct] and sit around the table so we may talk and hold 
consultations. 
  [Salamah] The YSP has addressed urgent calls to the Arab 
League to have it immediately intervene to stop the battles. 
The Arab League delegation to Yemen still waits in Sanaa 
without any result. The delegation still waits to meet [words 
indistinct]. On your part, do you still hope for the success of 
the Arab efforts to stop the fighting? 
  [Al-Dali] The truth is that the parliamentary bloc within 
the 
YSP is the one that addressed an urgent call to the Arab League 
to stop this massacre Sanaa's soldiers are determined to carry 
out. Yes, we still call for stopping the fighting and the 
bloodshed, in spite of everything. We, the Yemenis, do not 
have any other course but to sit together after stopping the 
fighting and to hold a dialogue. We give the Arab League an 
important role. We hope that it succeeds in its endeavor. 
  [Salamah] Many Arab countries, especially Syria, as well as 
the Arab League, today made a new appeal to the friends in Yemen 
to halt the battles and implement the pledge and accord 
document. This is what the United States also did yesterday. 
Do you believe this document is still suitable and can be 
implemented after all what has happened? Will the Yemeni 
leaders respond to the calls of the fraternal and friendly 
countries? 
  [Al-Dali] I believe that if the fighting halts, the document 
can be discussed because it is still vital. 
  [Salamah] What new element can make Yemeni leaders implement 
this document, which was signed in Amman a long time ago? 
  [Al-Dali] I said we hope the other party will also be ready 
to implement and apply the document. But if they do not want 
to, as they did in the past, if they reject the document, or if 
they are unable to implement it, then that is another question. 
The document cannot be applied by one party. The document 
should be applied by all parties involved. For our part in the 
YSP, we still believe the document can be applied and can be 
dealt with. But, if the other party does not want to, then this 
is another question and it will be difficult and even impossible 
to implement the document. 
  [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, in light of the facts 
in 
the field and the adopted positions, it is regrettably clear 
that the military option still overwhelms other options. The 
contradiction has assumed a conflicting nature, and it may not 
be decided in light of current factors unless there is a victor 
and a vanquished in Yemen. Do you believe that there is still a 
chance of dealing with the conflict politically? 
  [Al-Dali] I believe that despite all that has taken place, 
we 
can deal with the issue politically. We always prefer the 
political option, to which we should resort in the final 
analysis, when all the other options, including the military 
one, fail -- a military option adopted by Sanaa. We have not 
resorted to the military option. We have opted for the 
political solution. We believe that after the military option 
fails, Sanaa will inevitably return to the political option. 
  [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, the human and the 
material losses are huge. How long will the fighting in Yemen 
continue, in your opinion? 
  [Al-Dali) We will continue it until the last man. We will 
not allow the imposition of any solution by force. We will not 
allow any one to enslave us in this way Sanaa (?ruler) wants. 
  [Salamah] Thank you Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali for your 
interview with Paris Radio Monte Carlo.

  [Text] Doha, May 16 (AFP)--Northern forces loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih aim to blockade the southern 
bastion of Aden but not capture it, Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Basindwah said Monday. 
  "The priority is not to capture Aden but to put it under 
blockade, by controlling its entries and surrounding heights," 
Basindwah, a northerner loyal to the president, told the Qatari 
newspaper AL-SHARQ. 
  The northern army would not try to capture Aden, a 
stronghold 
of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, to "save human lives and 
vital economic facilities" in the southern port city. 
  "Toppling the separatist clique within the Yemeni Socialist 
Party" of al-Bid "is the responsibility of the people, the 
leaders and the unionist militants of the YSP and their armed 
forces," Basindwah said. 
  His comments came as Salih's forces, fighting an all-out war 
against al-Bid's since May 5, were reported Sunday to be 
advancing on Aden. 
  Basindwah repeated that al-Bid and his followers should be 
brought to court "for plotting against the unity" of Yemen. 
  North and South Yemen merged into a single state four years 
ago. 
  He reiterated the north's rejection of an Arab military 
intervention to stop the fighting, saying this would mean a 
"recognition of an entity led by the rebels."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Nasir Farghali </F>
in London; date not given; from the "Face to Face" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Farghali] The incident that is still on the minds 
of the Arab public since all of us watched the signing of the 
Cairo agreement on 4 May took place on the stage of the 
Conference Hall in Cairo. Can you tell us what happened, since 
you were a principal player in it? 
  [Musa] We were not involved in what happened on the day of 
the signing. It was between Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and 
Yitzhaq Rabin. It concerned clarification about some matters 
related to the maps of Jericho and Gaza, specifically Jericho. 
The size agreed on was not final. In other words, the 
agreement on it was not as it had been decided on early that 
morning after a long night of discussions that continued in 
President Mubarak's office until 0300. We agreed that there 
would be a letter recording that the size was not final and that 
negotiations would continue to define the size of the Jericho 
area. That letter was not appended to the map. Abu-'Ammar 
hesitated when he was about to sign until he saw the letter and 
then he signed. 
  [Farghali] Coincidentally, I was covering the event for MBC 
on that day. We all saw Abu-'Ammar write something down. 
  [Musa] He was referring to the letter. 
  [Farghali] What happened when you withdrew from the stage 
for 
some minutes? 
  [Musa] Abu-'Ammar wanted to see the letter. President 
Mubarak also wanted to see it. We wanted to be sure that the 
letter existed. When we ascertained this, Abu-'Ammar returned 
to sign. It was not a question of whether Abu-'Ammar wanted to 
sign or not. We wanted to see the letter. The discussions 
ended at 0300 and we were all tired and could have missed 
something. This is why we all wanted to be sure before 
Abu-'Ammar signed. When I say we all, I mean Palestine and 
Egypt. We wanted to be sure that this letter existed. 
  [Farghali] Among the Palestinians there are reservations 
about and fears from the peace process and from what is 
happening on the Palestinian-Israeli track. I believe that 
Egypt has a major responsibility here because it has been its 
fate to play this great role. 
  [Musa] The fears will remain. We understand this because we, 
too, had some fears during the Camp David talks. We asked 
ourselves: Will the Israeli side fulfill its commitments? Will 
the issue end as we want? Will we retrieve all the territories 
when there are talks about stages? The important thing is how 
Abu-'Ammar and the Palestinians manage their own affairs and 
tackle the problems that will arise. There will be many 
problems, but there is no other way. The issue now is the quick 
retrieval of the land. The problem of Israeli settlements will 
become less the quicker we are in retrieving the land. Had the 
Palestinian side worked with us when we were having the Camp 
David negotiations with Israel, it would have most certainly 
reached a better agreement. Why? Because the number of 
settlements and settlers was much less then. Instead of dealing 
with 120,000 settlers, the Palestinian side would have dealt 
with 8,000 settlers and with 10 or a small number of settlements 
instead of 180. That exacerbated the situation. The more we 
waited, the more Palestinian lands were lost. The Palestinians 
have now started on the right track, namely that of obtaining 
the land and starting to build an entity and a Palestinian 
authority with its own identity and a large measure of 
independence. Of course, all of us on the Arab side should 
realize that the Oslo agreement on Gaza and Jericho first--which 
was signed in Washington and on which negotiations continued 
until its document of implementation was signed in Cairo--is the 
first step. The Palestinian state has not been established. 
The right to self-determination has not been exercised yet. 
The Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories has 
not been done yet. Self-rule in all the occupied territories 
has not been achieved yet. These are the facts and there is no 
need for oneupmanship or criticism. Why? Because we, and 
specifically the Palestinians, are not starting from zero but 
from below zero. For the Palestinians, what is needed are not 
slogans, shouts, or oneupmanship. Whoever has more to give than 
Abu-'Ammar, let him come forward and show us. Let him say: I 
can bring you such and such things. I say very frankly that we 
believe that criticism for its own sake and hoping that the 21st 
or 22nd Century might bring a solution are shallow words. Do 
what you can do. Take your land. Achieve the first Israeli 
withdrawal from the Palestinian territories occupied after 1967. 
The more we stay without improving the situation, the more lands 
are lost. Oneupmanship and too much talk do not bring any 
results. 
  [Farghali] We opened this subject because, as you know, 
many people do not have the full picture. You certainly 
clarified some very important matters for us. It is being said, 
for instance, that the Egyptian leadership is putting pressure 
on Abu-'Ammar personally to sign.... 
  [Musa, interrupting] There is absolutely no Egyptian 
pressure. We fully realize the delicate nature of this stage as 
well as Arab sensitivities. What Egypt is doing is to help the 
Palestinians, as I have already told you. Take the example you 
mentioned regarding the signing ceremony on the stage. 
President Mubarak's concern, like that of president 'Arafat, 
was to be sure that a letter really existed. So there was no 
reproach or blame on our part. Our feeling was: Well, he is 
right. Let him be sure about every point before he signs. The 
Palestinian side is the weak side in the negotiations, because 
as I told you they started from below zero. The Israeli side is 
stronger because it has the land, the power, and several 
international circles backing it. The Egyptian role sought to 
give adequate strength to the Palestinians to be stronger 
against the Israelis. There were several points that on many 
occasions we said we could not accept and would reject, even if 
the Palestinians accepted them. Why? Because there are certain 
issues that we can never waive. We support the Palestinians in 
regaining their land. We do not push the Palestinians to make a 
specific decision. Absolutely not. The decision rests with 
Abu-'Ammar, the PLO Central Committee, and the Palestinian 
leadership. If they ask for our opinion, we give it to them, 
and it is not binding. If our assistance is requested, we 
assist. If we are not asked to give our opinion or if our 
assistance is not requested, we do not interfere. 
  [Farghali] In view of the current Palestinian circumstances 
you have mentioned, the Egyptian role becomes inevitable. 
However, things are different on the Syrian track. What is the 
nature of or prospects for the Egyptian role along that track? 
  [Musa] As you said, The Syrian issue or track is different. 
This is because there are more markers on this track than on the 
Palestinian track. For instance, there are Syrian international 
borders that can never be ignored. The same applies to Lebanon, 
which is a separate track. The Egyptian role here proceeds from 
the same policy and philosophy governing the subject. If our 
help is requested, we are ready to give it. If our opinion is 
sought, we are ready to give it. But Egypt does not volunteer 
to get involved in any of the Arab-Israeli negotiations unless 
the parties themselves ask us to help. 
  [Farghali] You will give a lecture here in London on the 
Middle East and regional policies. Many people wonder what is 
really being negotiated on the Syrian track. As you have 
stated, the international borders are known and there are 
several signals from Israel that the Golan will be returned to 
Syria. The problem of the settlements on the Golan is not as 
complicated as it is in other occupied Arab territories. But 
some say that the negotiations are actually about the situation 
in that area after a certain Israeli-Syrian settlement is 
reached. Is this true? 
  [Musa] No, it is not. What is happening is negotiations 
about the withdrawal, the future relations between Syria and 
Israel, and the security measures. That is all. 
  [Farghali] Do you foresee progress on the Israeli-Lebanese 
track? 
  [Musa] The Israeli-Lebanese track is very clear. Even under 
the Likud government the former prime minister declared that 
Israel has no territorial designs on Lebanon. Moreover, UN 
Security Council Resolution 425 is clear regarding the subject 
of withdrawal, in addition to other UN resolutions on the Middle 
East. The issue between Israel and Lebanon is not over 
territory but over how to achieve joint or mutual security and 
avert military clashes in southern Lebanon. There are certain 
political conditions in the region that link the Lebanese track 
to the Syrian track. However, it is clear to all that the 
Lebanese track is independent in all its aspects. 
  [Farghali] Another crisis has surfaced recently, namely the 
Yemeni crisis. You have repeatedly explained Egypt's stance on 
this situation. Egypt has always had a historic role in Yemen. 
How is Egypt dealing with the current crisis? 
  [Musa] Our efforts are based on mediation and calming 
matters between the two sides. Yesterday President Mubarak 
received the Yemeni foreign minister. Before that he received 
envoys from the two sides in Yemen. We want to make it clear 
that the current military operations between the south and the 
north have opened the gates of hell. In other words, matters 
will not end well. Unity must be based on dialogue. Up to this 
moment the two sides have not spoken about secession. Unity 
must be maintained. Even if there are differences, there are 
ways to settle them. This is what we are trying to explain. An 
Egyptian envoy went to Yemen and stayed several days there to 
study the situation and attempt to calm matters. Many efforts 
were intended to support the unity but resulted in supporting a 
clash between the two sides and in the loss of confidence 
between many officials in the north and the south. All this has 
made the situation in Yemen very serious, which requires 
constant and effective intervention. This is what we are doing 
as best we can. That is why we asked for a meeting of the Arab 
League. We said the Arab League should not remain indifferent 
to this dispute. We said the subject must be discussed by the 
Arab League. The subject was discussed by the Arab League; the 
meeting has been suspended but has not ended. The problem in 
Yemen will affect the Arab world from both a geographic and a 
political point of view. The final say is for the Yemeni 
people. It is not for us or for anyone else to impose unity or 
secession. They united, they must preserve this unity. 
Anything that deepens the secession, causes bloodshed, and 
creates loss of confidence is a bad indication for Yemen and the 
Yemenis. We hope they will succeed in establishing a quick 
dialogue and in turning this page that has spawned clashes, 
bloodshed, and martyrs on both sides. This is one country. 
They are, after all, Arabs. No side can claim victory over the 
other side because this is not victory. Ultimately, matters 
will not end like this. 
  [Farghali] It is said that Egypt wanted to dispatch forces 
to help disengage the warring forces in Yemen. 
  [Musa] No, no. This is not true. What happened is that one 
of the ideas proposed was that if there was any need for Arab, 
not Egyptian, peacekeeping forces the matter could have been 
considered by the Arab League. But the issue depends on Arab 
League approval and the acceptance of Yemen. However, the 
current circumstances are not suitable for that. 
  [Farghali] Egyptian troops have taken part in the UN 
missions 
in Somalia and Bosnia. Do you think this role will be promoted, 
particularly since the United Nations is headed by Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali? Will this role expand. How does the Egyptian 
leadership view this role? 
  [Musa] This is all contingent on the UN Security Council's 
resolutions and not on the secretary general or his nationality. 
It depends on two matters. If the Security Council decides to 
send UN troops to disputed areas, it will contact many 
countries, and perhaps all countries. The Security Council will 
ask them: Do you wish to participate in this work? It also 
depends on the state's decision whether to participate. 
  We participated in Mozambique, Western Sahara, Burundi, 
Somalia, Bosnia, and Cambodia. We did not only send troops but 
observers. Some of our involvement was done on the request from 
the United Nations and the appeal from the Organization of 
African Unity. Our decision to participate in the peacekeeping 
process was basically made for African considerations. However, 
there are two factors governing the participation of troops. 
There is the UN Security Council decision to establish a 
peacekeeping process in certain areas. This is usually followed 
by UN contacts with all the member states to ask whether they 
wish to participate in this process. It is also our decision 
whether to participate or not. We refused to participate in 
certain areas. We did participate in Somalia and Bosnia because 
these are extremely important issues. We decided to do so 
because this was incumbent upon us to participate in sending 
troops. 
  [Farghali] Western countries are facing problems in 
providing 
troops that are requested by the United Nations to implement its 
resolutions. Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia might take time and 
require negotiations. Perhaps this issue will never be solved. 
It seems that the Egyptian participation is almost guaranteed 
and will be relied upon by the UN secretary general. 
  [Musa] The Egyptian participation is more relied upon than 
guaranteed. This is because the issue depends on the Security 
Council decision and the decision of the state whether to send 
troops. As I said, we focus on Africa more than any other 
place. But the issue of Bosnia is important as far as we are 
concerned. Hence, the Egyptian force was sent right from the 
start. But there are other countries that have troops in Bosnia 
and other places. Turkey, for example, has troops in Bosnia and 
other areas as well. There are also small countries that 
participate in peacekeeping processes. We will participate and 
we will help Butrus-Butrus Ghali in this matter. We will help 
and will continue to participate in the peacekeeping process. 
  [Farghali] What about the Egyptian moves concerning ties 
with 
the Arab Gulf states and the security strategy in the region 
within the context of the new world order? What is the nature 
of the Egyptian moves? 
  [Musa] The pan-Arab security issue is under discussion. I 
prefer not to elaborate on it now because it is a complex issue 
linked with many political circumstances and developments in the 
region. Therefore, talking about this issue in a minute or two 
would harm it. Please accept my apology. However, I would like 
to tell you that this issue is extremely important and was 
included in the Arab League agenda on Egypt's request in 
September 1991. 
  [Farghali] Thank you, Your Excellency. 
  [Musa] You are welcome.

  [Text] London, 13 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
emphasized Egypt's deep interest in the need to reach a just 
solution to the Bosnian problem. He called for lifting the 
weapons embargo to Bosnia and denounced the behavior of the 
forces that have been dealing with this problem but have not 
been serious about finding a solution to it. He described the 
crisis as a bad omen for the international community. 
  In a lecture he delivered today before the Royal British 
Institute for Foreign Affairs (Chatham House), Musa said that 
more complicated problems will arise in Central and Eastern 
Europe if no solution is found to the Bosnian problem. He 
criticized the international community's behavior on this issue 
and condemned racial and sectarian discrimination in Bosnia. 
  'Amr Musa reiterated Egypt's stance, which calls for lifting 
the embargo on weapons to Bosnia, noting that the Serbs are 
getting weapons from Belgrade. He said that Egypt is ready to 
provide troops within the framework of a relevant UN resolution. 
He added: We in Egypt feel disappointed with the contradictory 
actions of the international community in Bosnia. He stressed 
the need to respect human rights there, adding that what is 
happening in Bosnia is a test for the new world order. 
  In his lecture, which was attended by a number of Arab 
ambassadors, the British ambassador in Egypt, and a number of 
Middle East experts, the foreign minister referred to his visit 
to South Africa. He said that South Africa is now in the stage 
of change and that the nineties are important to all of us. He 
added: The change taking place now has positive and negative 
aspects. A new stage has also started in the Middle East 
following the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He said: We are 
seeking to achieve a permanent settlement based on guaranteeing 
the inalienable and political rights of everyone in the region 
and are looking toward the post-settlement stage to achieve 
development and prosperity. He noted that the achievement of 
these objectives will come through cooperation between all 
countries of the region. 
  Musa added that Egypt will continue its efforts to give 
impetus to the peace process in the region, achieve peaceful 
coexistence between all parties, and reach a just solution that 
guarantees all the political rights of the parties involved. He 
emphasized that the stage following the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement will require more efforts, 
especially as there are still obstacles to peace. 
  He explained that Egypt is seeking to achieve an Israeli 
withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, guarantee 
security for all countries, and establish peaceful and normal 
relations with Israel. He said: If all this is done, then the 
Middle East region will be completely different. 
  The foreign minister said: Egypt has proposed the 
establishment of a forum for the Mediterranean basin countries 
to achieve cooperation between them and ensure that the Middle 
East region will be completely free from weapons of mass 
destruction on condition that all countries, including Israel, 
comply. Then the economic growth desired by all countries in 
the region will be achieved and the area will benefit from the 
available resources and thus ensure a better future for their 
peoples. 
  'Amr Musa, who is currently paying a visit to Britain, went 
on to say that Egypt's objective is to ensure that the Middle 
East is not isolated from the world but is interacting with its 
peoples. He said: While the region is now preoccupied with the 
peace process, it is also looking toward ending all the problems 
surrounding it, such as the one in Bosnia. He stressed that the 
situation in Bosnia does not differ much from the former state 
of the Cold War. He added: The threat to peace in Bosnia and 
the Balkans also is a threat to the Middle East and the 
Mediterranean basin. We must open the doors for interaction 
between the cultures of Europe, the Arab region, and the 
Mediterranean basin. He said: We do not want to go back to the 
Cold War era with all its challenges, hatreds, and 
confrontations. 
  Musa noted that Egypt is interested in solving the problems 
in Yemen, Sudan, and Iraq because his country is part of the 
region, knows its responsibilities regarding these problems, and 
earnestly seeks to achieve stability in the area. He pointed 
out that as far as Yemen is concerned, Egypt seeks to contain 
the current differences and crisis there. 
  Referring to the British policy, which he said he noted in 
his current talks with senior British officials, Musa said that 
Britain also wants to help achieve stability in the Middle East. 
He also noted that Egypt is interested in steering the 
Israeli-Palestinian talks in the right direction to achieve the 
desired objectives. He pointed out that the confidence-building 
process between the Arabs and Israel has already started but it 
requires time. It also must come from both sides, not just from 
the Arabs. Israel must work in that direction, too, he added. 
  Musa stressed that the peace process in the region is still 
just beginning, since the negotiations between Israel and 
Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon still remain. He noted that the Arab 
boycott of Israel will be lifted, but at the appropriate time. 
  Musa noted that Egypt is concerned about the developments in 
Algeria. He hoped that stability will be achieved in Algeria, 
adding that the Algerian people are capable of establishing 
stability. He noted that what is happening in Algeria does not 
worry Egypt alone but all the countries in the region, the Arab 
and Islamic worlds, and Europe. He urged helping Algeria emerge 
from its current crisis. 
  Turning to Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa noted that 
there 
is a difference between the two governments over the two 
countries' policies. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the 
partitioning of Sudan. 
  On relations with Iran, Musa said that Egypt is concerned 
with security in the Gulf and the need to prevent attempts to 
export the Iranian revolution to other countries in the region. 
He added: With the exception of these points, there is no 
political antagonism between us and Iran. He called for Iran to 
change the policies it follows regarding the Arab region. 
  Concerning the issue of Jerusalem, Musa said that it will be 
part of the negotiations to be held at a later stage between 
Israel and the Palestinians. He added: There is no reason to 
object to the principle of negotiations over Jerusalem or 
dividing it. The whole issue, he added, is negotiable between 
the Palestinians and Israelis. He stressed that Jerusalem will 
remain one city [madinah wahidah] and its status will be 
discussed at a later stage in the negotiations. 
  Regarding the question of Iraq, Musa said that this issue is 
very complicated. He added: There is only one key to the 
crisis with Kuwait, namely, that Iraq recognizes Kuwait and that 
the UN Security Council resolutions on this subject be 
implemented. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the 
partitioning of Iraq or anything that may jeopardize its 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  Concerning the situation in Lebanon, Musa said that things 
are improving there and that the Lebanese Government is 
extending its authority over Lebanese territory. He stressed 
that Egypt is concerned with Lebanon's sovereignty and stability. 
  Regarding Lebanese-Syrian negotiations, Musa said that there 
is a framework for negotiations and there are Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 425. He hoped that stability will be 
restored in Lebanon and that the country will return its former 
stability.

  [Text] An official security source at the Interior Ministry 
today said that within the activity of the State Intelligence 
Agency following the death of Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the general 
leader of the terrorist groups; in accordance with a plan to 
promote security operations; based on recent information 
gathered from organizational papers and terrorist operations; 
after an accurate watch of the terrorist groups at home and 
abroad; and in light of the results of intensive investigations 
security forces raided 11 hideouts at the same time in the 
Governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, Ismailia, al- Daqahliyah, and 
al-Qalyubiyah. 
  Associates of terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam and leaders of 
the military wing were arrested in the raids. Seven modern cars 
of various types were seized. One of them was used in the 
assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat and in the 
attack against the officers of Abu Za'bal prison. Explosive, 
chemical, and incendiary materials were also seized along with 
some sketches of figures on the assassination list. 
  The investigations showed that two lawyers acted as contacts 
between terrorist leaders in Egypt and abroad. The State 
Prosecution Office is interrogating the suspects. 
Investigations are now under way to arrest seven remaining 
fugitive terrorists as well as some terrorists abroad. The 
Interior Ministry appeals to citizens with any information about 
the fugitive terrorists to contact the security services. The 
source said that the Interior Ministry in the next few days will 
announce the release of a number of prisoners who have repented 
and have renounced extremism and a departure from religion.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by dismissed Yemeni Oil </F>
Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun by Nabil Ghazzawi in Amman 
on 14 May] 
  [Text] Yemeni Oil Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun told 
a news conference at the Jordan Intercontinental Hotel yesterday 
morning that he conveyed to His Majesty King Husayn a message 
from his brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], on Yemeni 
developments since the eruption of fighting among the brothers 
and sons of the one Yemeni homeland. 
  Bin-Husaynun said the YSP leadership welcomes any call or 
mediation by His Majesty King Husayn to halt the current 
bloodshed in Yemen. He praised the sincere Jordanian role 
represented by King Husayn's continuing personal efforts to 
spare blood, heal the rift, and maintain Yemeni unity, as well 
as his majesty's continuous call on brothers to apply logic in 
solving their differences. He said that Jordan, represented by 
His Majesty King Husayn, and Oman represented by His Majesty 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, exerted great efforts to resolve the 
Yemeni crisis, which resulted in the signing of the pledge and 
accord document in Amman on 10 Ramadan. He added: The current 
events would not have happened if the other party had 
implemented the document, to which we adhere and which addresses 
all aspects of the crisis. 
  Bin-Husaynun accused President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of 
obstructing the implementation of the document, especially after 
he felt that its implementation would greatly curtail his 
powers, and said he began the Abyan battle only one day after 
the document was signed, when all Yemeni parties were still in 
Amman. He said the president ordered the al-'Amaliqah Brigade 
forces to start the battle, which was followed by other battles 
that resulted in the destruction of some brigades of the Yemeni 
Armed Forces in the south. 
  He stressed that the YSP is a unionist party and will 
continue to be so. He said it was the YSP that achieved unity 
and handed power over to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He 
denied reports that neighboring states are helping the YSP in 
the Yemeni crisis and said these are excuses made by others. He 
indicated that the coming days will reveal those who support the 
unity and those who oppose it. 
  He stressed that guns cannot solve any problem and voiced 
optimism that logic will replace force as a means to protect the 
citizens and Armed Forces from destruction and eventually 
preserve the unity of the homeland. 
  Bin-Husaynun said the discovery of oil or the existence of 
oil reserves in the south is not the cause of the crisis and 
war. The causes, he said, lie in political differences and 
contradictions. He said oil was discovered in both the north and 
south before unity and it is not the property of one person, but 
all the Yemeni people. 
  He denied that Yemeni territory has been leased to Saudi 
Arabia and said there are border issues that can be solved 
through dialogue. He said a Yemeni-Saudi committee is in charge 
of this. 
  Asked about the legitimacy of the decisions made by 
President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni House of Representatives to 
depose Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, and the oil minister, Bin-Husaynun said 
these decisions were stupid, illegal, and will not solve the 
problem. He said the one who declares war on his people can 
have no legitimacy and that all President Salih's decrees are 
illegitimate. 
  Asked about President Salih's refusal to halt the fighting, 
Bin-Husaynun said that this is unusual in society whether on the 
Arab or international level. This refusal was condemned by more 
than 30 states during the inauguration of Nelson Mandela in 
South Africa recently. 
  The Yemeni minister denied the presence of troops loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih near Aden. He said what 
'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani said in this regard is not true 
because fighting is now taking place on axes more than 120 km 
from Aden. He added: The southern town of al-Dali', which 
reportedly fell to the hands of the northern forces, is still in 
our hands. Moreover, our forces are in control of Bab el 
Mandeb. He said battles are currently taking place in the Abyan 
Governorate and that there were no battles in the Zinjibar and 
Ja'ar areas during the past two days. 
  Responding to a question, Bin-Husaynun said the YSP rejects 
the principle of separation as an alternative to war and as a 
solution to the crisis because the party principles are based on 
the unity of Yemen. He denied that Arab forces are fighting 
with the northern forces, stressing that elements from some Arab 
states with only political affiliations were captured. 
  Concluding, Bin-Husaynun stressed that the current crisis is 
not a personal one between the president and his deputy, but is 
due to basic differences over Yemeni issues such as authority, 
security, and economic and social development. 
  Bin-Husaynun said he will visit other Arab states following 
his visit to Jordan, including Saudi Arabia, for the same 
purpose.

  [Text] The closing session of the Jordanian-Palestinian 
Economic Committee, due to have convened in Amman this morning, 
has been postponed. Also postponed was a subsequent news 
conference by the chairmen of the Jordanian and Palestinian 
sides to the committee, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state 
for cabinet affairs and minister of information; and Mr. Ahmad 
Quray', the PLO's Economic Department chief. 
  In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Dr. al-'Anani 
attributed the delay to the preoccupation of the Palestinian 
leadership with numerous issues, including the formation of the 
Palestinian Authority Council and matters related to the 
transfer of power. 
  The final session of the Jordanian-Palestinian talks that 
began in Amman Tuesday [10 May] is due to be held within days. 
  During the two-day meeting, the committee addressed numerous 
economic items, including trade, banking, monetary policies, 
customs, and tourism.

<F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The release of details of agreements reached 
between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
on implementing their Jan. 7 economic accord has been delayed 
for 48 hours upon the request of the PLO leadership, both sides 
said Friday [13 May]. 
  It was not immediately known whether the PLO leadership in 
Tunis would seek any amendment to the agreements, which were 
supposed to have been formalised and released Thursday through a 
joint statement and a press conference. 
  The delay in the process was attributed to the PLO Executive 
Committee's preoccupations with naming members of an "autonomy 
cabinet" for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Information made available to the JORDAN TIMES indicated 
that 
the main points covered by the agreements included: 
  -- The formation of a joint committee for banking and 
monetary affairs in the autonomous territories; envisaged under 
the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO declaration of principles; 
  -- Free trade between Jordan and the autonomous territories; 
and 
  -- Maintaining the Jordanian dinar as the "main currency" in 
circulation in the occupied territories. 
  "These are the salient points in the agreement which are of 
utmost importance at this point in time," said a Palestinian 
source. "Other points cover the technical details of how to 
implement these decisions and also touch upon tourism," said the 
source, who preferred anonymity. 
  Jordanian sources confirmed that these were the broad 
outline 
of the agreements, reached in two days of talks between a 
high-level Jordanian delegation headed by Minister of State for 
Cabinet Affairs Jawad al-'Anani and a PLO team led by Ahmad 
Quray', director of the Economic Department of the PLO. 
  "It is an implementation-oriented document, and we hope to 
launch moves on the ground as soon as it is ratified by the 
leaderships of the two countries," said a senior-Jordanian 
source, adding that the government had reviewed and endorsed it. 
  According to the source, who also preferred anonymity, "the 
agreements are those we could arrive at, given the peculiar 
circumstances of Palestinian autonomy." 
  "Are the Palestinians free to decide and act as they want?" 
asked another official, in a reference to an economic agreement 
signed by the PLO and Israel in Paris in April. 
  That accord details a series of measures that are widely 
seen 
as confining the PLO's freedom in exercising its economic 
options with Jordan, or any other party other than the occupying 
power itself. Furthermore, it also closed the door against the 
implementation of some of the provisions in the Jan. 7 agreement 
signed between Jordan and the PLO in Amman. 
  Asked whether the agreements reached last week reflected the 
Kingdom's acceptance that they were the best that the Kingdom 
and the PLO could hope for, given the Israeli-imposed 
limitations, the source was non-committal, saying: "That's your 
deduction." 
  The sources said the joint Jordanian-Palestinian committee 
on 
banking and monetary affairs could meet as early as Saturday, 
shortly after the expected release of the details of the 
document. 
  Under the agreements, the committee, which will be headed on 
the Jordanian side by the deputy governor of the Central Bank of 
Jordan (CBJ) and on the Palestinian side by the deputy 
governor's counterpart from the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), will monitor and 
control banking and currency affairs in the occupied territories. 
  Jordanian banks which have already been licensed by the CBJ 
to reopen their branches in the occupied territories will also 
come under the committee's control and supervision. All future 
applications for licensing will be dealt with by the committee. 
  The sources said Jordan had expressed reservations over a no 
ceiling, free-trade arrangement between the Kingdom and the 
autonomous territories and but then dropped its reservations. 
The Kingdom had suggested a $300 million ceiling for trade, but 
the PLO could not meet that volume because of the 
Israeli-imposed curbs in the Paris agreement. 
  "We decided to keep trade open-ended in the initial stage," 
said the Jordanian source. "We hope to develop it further as we 
go along further in our economic cooperation." 
  There were no formal meetings on Thursday. Royal Court Chief 
Sharif Zayid Bin Shakir and the King's advisors held talks with 
the PLO delegation. No details were available on the 
discussions. 
  "We have forwarded the agreements to the PLO Executive 
Committee and are awaiting its response," said the Palestinian 
source. "We hope to receive the committee's endorsement anytime 
now." 
  "Hopefully, we could wind up the meetings early Saturday and 
release the details," added the source. 
  The self-rule authority will use the Jordanian dinar in all 
its dealing, he source said. 
  "The dinar will be the main currency in circulation in 
autonomous territories as well as the rest of the occupied 
lands," said the source. 
  All other currencies, including the Israeli shekel, will 
also 
be used, added the source. 
  The Paris agreement states that the shekel will be "a legal 
tender" in he autonomous territories.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
at his office today Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, Syria's minister of 
economy and foreign trade and head of the Syrian delegation to 
the meetings of the joint Jordanian-Syrian ministerial 
committee. They discussed economic ties and means to bolster 
and improve them. They also discussed prospects for cooperation 
in the fields of trade and joint industry, as well as the issue 
of water. They stressed the need to cooperate and coordinate 
on this vital issue. They agreed in principle to prepare for 
the meetings of the Jordanian-Syrian higher committee. 
  The specialized committees emanating from the joint 
Jordanian-Syrian ministerial committee resumed their meetings at 
the Trade and Industry Ministry today to discuss relations of 
fraternal cooperation between the two countries in all fields, 
particularly the economic and trade fields. The committees also 
discussed a number of issues related to the development of 
economic cooperation and trade, particularly in the field of 
joint ventures, as well as the free zones and financial 
cooperation. 
  Dr. Hisham al-Khatib, minister of water and irrigation, 
received the Syrian economy and foreign trade minister and his 
delegation. They discussed cooperation and coordination between 
the two countries and means of improving cooperation for the 
benefit of the two fraternal peoples. They discussed means to 
improve coordination in the field of the exchange of visits and 
expertise to benefit from the two sides' experience in the water 
and irrigation fields. 
  Supply Minister Radi Ibrahim also met today with Dr. 
Muhammad 
al-'Imadi, the Syrian economy and foreign trade minister, and 
Dr. Ahmad Nizam-al-Din, Syria's industry minister. They 
discussed trade ties between the two countries, particularly in 
the field of supply, and the possibility of Jordan purchasing 
Syrian fodder, wheat, beans, and lentils, especially because 
Syria can offer a surplus of these commodities at competitive 
prices and with good quality. 
  Transport Minister Adib Halasah today met with Dr. Muhammad 
al-'Imadi, the Syrian economy and foreign trade minister, and 
Ahmad Nizam-al-Din, Syria's industry minister. Following the 
meeting, the transport minister said he discussed with the two 
Syrian ministers the means of developing cooperation in the 
field of transportation, especially since there are some joint 
Jordanian-Syrian companies for land transportation and the 
transportation of goods between the two fraternal countries. 
There is also a joint maritime company based in the Syrian port 
of Latakia. Halasah explained that the Syrian minister of 
economy and foreign trade expressed a desire to strengthen 
cooperation between the two countries in the industrial and 
trade fields.

side by Industry and Trade Minister Rima Khalaf and on the 
Syrian side by Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Muhammad

trade between the two countries. Ms. Khalaf stressed that the 
committee's meetings dealt with some problems impeding the flow 
of Jordanian commodities to the Syrian market. The two 
countries, she said, have agreed to the need of revising lists 
of exchanged commodities. "We tackled at the committee's 
meetings issues relating to transport... and banking 
arrangements," said Ms. Khalaf adding that the two sides have 
agreed to set up experts committee to prepare a future work plan 
for Jordanian-Syrian economic cooperation. This plan will be

  [Text] The Senate has expressed appreciation for the U.S. 
Senate's call for the lifting of the unjust arms embargo on the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In a cable in the name of the Senate to the president of the 
U.S. Senate, Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi expressed hope that 
this step will be followed by other steps until the embargo is 
lifted and this peace-loving nation can acquire the means for 
legitimate self-defense and the liberation of their national 
soil, against an all-out war of annihilation in which atrocities 
are committed under the gaze of the civilized world. 
  Al-Lawzi stressed that if the United States plays its 
leading 
role in deterring aggression and preventing it from making any 
regional gains, it will restore confidence in the world order 
and international law and the UN Charter. This will spare the 
world and future generations wars and disasters motivated by 
racial and religious bias and the oppression of the weak by the 
strong.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Art of the Possible"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
impending visit to Syria and Israel in a bid to rekindle their 
negotiating track comes amidst renewed speculation that not much 
could be expected to emerge from his latest shuttle diplomacy. 
Washington has in fact predicted no imminent breakthrough in 
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks even though it made sufficient 
hints to suggest that their bilateral negotiations have entered 
a new stage and could come to fruition later on. This suggests 
that enough progress was attained during the last trip by 
Christopher to warrant its continuation. 
  It would naturally be unreasonable to presume that the 
secretary of state is coming back to the region on a wild goose 
chase. But, it must be remembered that Damascus has also made 
an issue of the fact that it is still on the U.S. list of 
countries sponsoring "terrorism" and has injected this matter 
into its contacts with Washington. Presumably this subject will 
figure highly on the Syrian leaders' talks with Christopher when 
he arrives in the Syrian capital Sunday. President Hafiz 
al-Asad cannot be expected to accommodate Washington on its 
efforts to energise the Syrian-Israeli track as long as his 
country is viewed and treated as some kind of terrorist state. 
  Israel, on the other hand, seeks to know in advance the 
extent and scope of peace that Damascus would be willing to 
offer in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
In this vein, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has proposed 
a phased Israeli pullout stretching over eight to ten years in 
order to test the workability of the Syrian peace intentions. 
Rabin has yet to confirm or deny, however, that Israel would be 
willing to withdraw completely from the occupied Syrian 
territory at the end of the tunnel. 
  President al-Asad insists, and rightly so, on receiving a 
clear commitment from Rabin that full withdrawal from the 
heights would be in the cards in return for normalisation of 
relations between the two countries. What this complex 
situation boils down to is similar to the vexing egg-and-chicken 
syndrome where one set of questions begs the other. This is 
where Christopher may help by attempting to offer simultaneous 
answers to concurrent questions. 
  Bridging the gap between the two countries is still 
possible, 
and that, we guess, is why the secretary of state is coming back 
so soon to the region.

  [Text] Jordan said it expects a land-inspection regime to 
begin soon in al-'Aqabah once approved by the United Nations 
Sanctions Committee. Minister of State for Prime Ministry 
Affairs and Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the 
new on-land inspection regime will save Jordan millions of 
dollars in losses. He told Jordan Television that Jordan has 
received a message from the U.S. Administration confirming the 
agreement on the new regime. 
  [Begin al-'Anani recording in Arabic with English subtitles] 
A message was received from the U.S. Administration via the 
U.S. State Department confirming what has been agreed upon; that 
the U.S. Government has accepted to replace the inspection which 
was carried out by multilateral forces, particularly the U.S. 
vessels, in the Straits of Tiran for the vessels heading toward 
al-'Aqabah with an on-land inspection in al-'Aqabah. Therefore, 
this arrangement will answer the United Nations' desire to 
maintain the inspection in implementation of the economic 
sanctions against Iraq, and, at the same time, directly affect 
the Jordanian economy in the sense that it will save large 
expenses. We know that since Resolution 661 was issued in 1990 
and until now, Jordan lost some $1.2 billion in expenses. [end

  [Text] Amman--Britain did not take part in the U.S.-led 
blockade of al-'Aqabah and had always urged its allies to end 
the inspection of ships in the Gulf of Aqaba, James Watt, the 
charge d'affairs at the British embassy, said Sunday [15 May]. 
  "My country has always been pressing for the ban to be 
lifted," Mr. Watt told a business luncheon. 
  On April 25, the United States said it has accepted a 
Jordanian proposal on a new land-based system for verifying 
compliance with the international sanctions, and His Majesty 
King Husayn said the al-'Aqabah siege was being lifted, after 
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 
London. 
  Mr. Christopher told reporters at a joint press conference 
with King Husayn that the U.S. had accepted the proposal to have 
the London-based Lloyds Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo 
once it is unloaded in the port instead of the sea-inspections, 
which have caused the Kingdom enormous economic losses. 
  The American decision was followed by a French announcement 
it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting the 
al-'Aqabah-bound shipping. 
  The U.S. confirmation that the siege was being lifted came 
on 
May 9, when Washington officially informed Jordan of its 
acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal. 
  "We were never part of the inspection groups, and Britain 
never supported the inspection from the beginning," Mr. Watt 
said. 
  Addressing a group of business people, Mr. Watt said the new 
process was a sign of optimism for the Jordanian economy, adding 
that Jordan has become a market which all industries are looking 
at. 
  "We are beginning to see some signs of hope after the peace 
process, and people are looking towards a bright future, making 
Jordan a very attractive market," he added. 
  Mr. Watt said Britain's policy was to encourage he Jordanian 
market, and to open up other markets in the region, "including 
Israel."

  [Text] If Washington were to use propaganda to justify its

Arabs, what should it say? This is the question that Washington 
officials are still asking themselves and they are coming up 
with the same stale reply. 
  To attain its objectives in the region, the United States 
has 
to continue to project the Islamic Republic of Iran as the 
regional bad guy. It has to depict the region as tense, to 
intimidate the southern shaykhdoms, and to warn them as if they 
are being threatened by Iran. Therefore, they should rely on 
the United States to help protect them. To do this it is 
necessary to launch propaganda regarding Iran's military 
capability so that the Arabs will allocate more petrodollars to 
purchase more arms to protect their security. 
  These remarks seem a trifle repetitive, but they are true. 
However, we are surprised and regret that these same remarks 
have worked on those on the other side of the Persian Gulf and 
that the United States continues to milk the regional shaykhs 
with this repetitive and deceitful propaganda. 
  This propaganda by Washington is continuing, but our 
question 
today is: Why don't the Arabs think about their own interests 
and continue to be duped by this hollow and repetitious 
propaganda? It is amazing that these Arab shaykhs do not even 
ask themselves: Who endangered the security of the region? Who 
instigated Saddam to initiate an eight-year war against Iran? 
Who has humiliated the Arabs before Israel? Who has made the 
Persian Gulf waters unsafe? Who plundered the wealth of the 
Arabs in two Persian Gulf wars? Who has eyes on the wealth and 
oil of the Arabs today? Who is demanding greater contempt and 
humiliation for the Arabs against Israel and formulating plans 
for this purpose? 
  These are questions that are not difficult for the regional 
shaykhs to answer. However, they do not even seem to have the 
permission to understand these facts! 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs 
Robert Pelletreau repeated these U.S. accusations against Iran 
in the presence of Arab representatives of the mass media in Abu 
Dhabi, and it seems that no one had the sense to ask Pelletreau 
to stop these repetitive remarks and say something new that 
should at least have some elements of reality. 
  A while later, the Arab mass media acted as if it had 
received fresh grist for its propaganda mills and repeated the 
same accusations verbatim along with whatever had been dictated 
to them by the U.S. officials. Thus, they demonstrated that 
they have no willpower or opinion and do not even realize their 
own interests. 
  In its latest edition, the 'UKAZ newspaper that is 
affiliated 
with the Zionist circles of Saudi Arabia and is directly 
instructed by the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, resorted to exposing 
the so-called nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
To make its allegations appear to be authentic, it presented 
astoundingly astronomical sums as Iran's nuclear expenditure. 
It appears that the entire text had been dictated verbatim by 
the CIA rapporteur at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh. 
  It is regrettable that the regional shaykhs have fallen into 
this vortex and cannot see these prospects very clearly with 
their astonished eyes. The fact that the Saudi publications 
take their orders from the U.S. Embassy is not a source of pride 
for the Saudis. It is not to their benefit to grovel so much 
and to show how eager they are to take dictation from the 
Americans. Perhaps it would have been better to have kept up 
appearances and have waited awhile before 'UKAZ published 
Pelletreau's repetitive remarks dictated by the United States. 
Then it would not have appeared to be so servile.

  [Text] Tehran, May 14 (AFP) -- A radical Islamic daily on 
Saturday [14 May] protested against a visit by a group of U.S. 
newspaper editors and said it would boycott a meeting between 
the journalists and representatives of the Iranian press. 
  The chief-editors of 13 US newspapers and magazines arrived 
here earlier this week on a three-day visit to "raise their 
understanding of present-day Iran," a U.S. journalist told AFP. 
  They have already held several meetings with representatives 
of the Iranian media and were to meet Saturday with the 
editors-in-chief of the press in Tehran. 
  "It is not clear who invited the American editors to Iran 
and 
why the Culture Ministry has arranged a meeting between them and 
Iranian chief-editors," said JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, a daily close to 
Islamic hardliners. 
  The paper warned that the meeting could be a "ploy" by 
Washington to try and reopen talks with Iran through an indirect 
channel. 
  Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after 
radical students stormed the U.S. Embassy here and took its 
staff hostage. 
  The United States has called several times for direct 
negotiations, but the two sides have yet to make a breakthrough. 
Islamic hardliners are fiercely opposed to any talks with 
Washington.

  [Text] In today's Tehran Friday prayers, Ayatollah 
Emami-Kashani condemned the British Government for installing a 
bugging device in the Iranian Embassy in London. 
  The interim Friday prayers leader of Tehran referred to 
Britain's record in espionage activities and said: This recent 
espionage activity in London against the Islamic Republic of 
Iran demonstrates the continuation of plots hatched by arrogant 
countries against the Islamic revolution; but such conspiracies 
are, as ever, doomed to fail, thanks to the vigilance and 
alertness of the Muslim people of Iran. 
  On the great hajj congregation, he said: The gathering of a 
cross-section of one billion world Muslims at pilgrimage is a 
suitable opportunity to review various political, social, and 
economic problems of the world of Islam and their solutions so 
that, upon their return to their countries, Muslims could 
implement those solutions. 
  He said the designation of a day for the support of Bosnian 
Muslims by the eminent leader's representative office was a 
correct use of the hajj to draw the attention of Muslims to 
problems of the world of Islam. 
  Ayatollah Emami-Kashani praised the people for participating 
in the international book exhibition and said: That matter shows 
that the people of Iran care about cultural issues.

  [Text] London, May 13, IRNA -- Following the disclosure of 
the British Government's bugging of the Iranian Embassy here, 
other ambassadors in London are skeptical of the security of 
their embassy vis-a-vis the government's espionage activities. 
  An Asian diplomat here has told his Iranian counterpart that 
there is a high likelihood that the British intelligence has 
carried out similar activities regarding the other embassies. 
  "We intend to carry out a thorough search in our embassy for 
sure," he said. 
  He noted that embassies of the Islamic countries are more 
exposed to the British eavesdropping due to the London's concern 
over the increasing growth of Islamism in Britain. 
  "Even the ambassadors of the European countries who are 
concerned over the issue, sarcastically ask the British 
politicians in their meetings as in what part of their embassies 
the British Government installed its eavsedropping devices," 
said the diplomat.

  [Text] Vienna, May 13, IRNA -- Western media's silence on 
bugging of the Iranian Embassy in London by the agents of 
British intelligence service is another indication to their 
double-standards. 
  The Western press, which a couple of weeks ago, reported on 
the false British allegations of Iran-IRA contacts in their 
headlines, have now apparently decided to ignore the bugging of 
Iranian Embassy completely. 
  This is not the first time that the so-called free press 
agencies of Western countries have collectively decided to keep 
quiet on issues embarrassing to so-called Western democracies. 
  The low-key reporting of atrocities committed in Bosnia when 
compared proportionally, the genocide of over 2,800 Panamanians 
resulting from U.S. invasion, the war crimes committed by 
British forces against Argentine POWs in the Falkland Islands, 
and the mysterious killing of Rwandan and Burundi presidents are 
just small reminders to those with common sense.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The discovery of a transmitter equipped with a 
microphone inside a wall in the Islamic Republic of Iran's [IRI] 
embassy in London has led to the disclosure of Britain's 
intelligence and spying operations, know as ME6 [as heard] 
against the IRI. Iran's deputy foreign minister in European and 
US affairs, Mr. Mahmoud Va'ezi, in an exclusive interview with 
the Central News Bureau of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, which was broadcast on the nationwide 
television channel last night, exposed further details of the 
ME6 spying operations against Iran's embassy in London and 
considered it as the British statesmen weakness in Irano-British 
relations. 
  Iran's deputy foreign minister also said: Following the 
disclosure of this issue, the British charge d'affaires in 
Tehran was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and Iran's severe 
protest was conveyed to the British Government. 
  In response to the question as to what impact will these 
kinds of anti-diplomatic acts leave on the two countries 
relations, Mr. Va'ezi said: Irano-British relations are not 
normal for they have been faced with abundant problems. The 
main issue is the existence of certain (?roles) in the British 
Government. Mr. Va'ezi's direct reference to this issue that 
problems in the Irano-British relations arise from groupings 
inside the Conservative British government is significant in 
view of problems which have led to weakness in John Major's 
government. It shows that the British statesmen have problems 
in following a coordinated policy in relation to Iran. Bringing 
up such claims as links between Iran and the Irish strugglers, 
which was categorically denied by Iran, further discredited John 
Major's government. On this basis, spying operations in a 
foreign embassy, which against all the international accepted 
standards and diplomatic practice, will put further pressure on 
the Conservative British government. 
  Some analysts consider John Major's weakened position as the 
factor behind such controvertial operations by the ME6 and they 
argue that the British officials' silence indicates difference 
of views and crisis which exist in the British Government. 
Nevertheless, since the Iranian Government is waiting for the 
British Government's answer, the British statesmen are unlikely 
to keep their silence. Hence they have to explain about their 
political mistakes.

  [Text] Tehran, May 14, IRNA -- A morning English daily here 
Saturday [14 May] commented on the installation of bugging 
devices in the Iranian Embassy in London saying that the British 
Government faces the two charges of espionage and violation of 
the terms of the 1961 Vienna Convention regarding the concept of 
national sovereignty. 
  The Iranian Government's disclosure about this illegal act 
was "coincident with the ballyhoo started by the British 
Government on the alleged Iranian financial assistance for the 
Irish Republican Army (IRA)," noted the paper. 
  It argued that the Irish Americans were the greatest 
supporters of the IRA and their financial and logistic 
assistance to IRA, with the green light from the C.I.A., was 
considered normal and acceptable in international political 
circles. 
  While the statesmen in London found it prudent to condone 
any 
differences they might have with the U.S. over the issue of IRA, 
they apparently felt it was necessary to transfer their internal 
crisis to other parts of the world, said the paper. 
  Urging Iran's Government to continue to exert pressure until 
British authorities were ready to accept responsibilty, the 
paper concluded "we should not allow such glaring cases of 
violation of the country's national sovereignty be easily 
forgotten."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The British--Once Again on the Wrong Path!"] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
  It appears on the basis of current facts and figures that 
Iranian-British relations will never acquire any stability. The 
British seem constantly itching to disrupt existing relations 
with Tehran by taking advantage of the situation. 
  If we were to assess the history of Iranian-British 
political 
relations over a 15-year period, we would conclude that these 
relations were never trusting. On one day the British 
Government--in its emulation of the United States and as a sign 
of sympathy with Washington--mars relations with Iran because of 
the fall of the den of spies [U.S. Embassy in Tehran]. However, 
when it stands to lose, it grovels for eight years for the 
restoration of relations. Eventually, because of the requests 
and pleading on the part of London, relations were resumed. On 
another day the mischievous British, who have used the 
unfortunate Salman Rushdie as a tool for their policies, once 
again broke off relations and then apologized and relations were 
resumed. 
  Today, once again the British have adopted a new policy in 
their propaganda and are making new claims. The response to the 
latest British claims is something that pertains to our Foreign 
Ministry, which on principle has delivered a firm and poised 
response on this matter. 
  However, it is essential that our officials should study 
this 
dossier and learn the appropriate lessons. They should reach 
the conclusion that the British are not reliable people and 
therefore it is necessary that the level of relations with 
London should be reduced to a minimum, especially in the 
economic field. 
  We should not forget that even on sending our students to 
England the British sought to capitalize on this issue for 
political leverage. They even deprived our students at the 
doctorate level from presenting their dissertations and expelled 
them in a hostile and unprincipled way. 
  With such a black dossier, the British are absolutely 
untrustworthy and the objective of their latest game has not yet 
been revealed. In any case, it is necessary that the Foreign 
Ministry and the decisionmaking centers be vigilant and appraise 
all aspects of the issue so that the London Government cannot 
capitalize once again on this foolish politico-propagandistic 
game. The experience of the past 15 years since our Revolution 
proves that it is only possible in this manner to make London 
realize that it is mistaken in its calculations and is treading 
the wrong path.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Shahidi: "The Juggling of the Methuselah </F>
of Imperialism"] 
  [Excerpts] In the wake of the diplomatic battles that began 
between Iran and Britain with the summons of our charge 
d'affaires to the British Foreign Office on Thursday [28 April], 
the British mass media initiated a heavy political onslaught 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [passage omitted] 
  One cannot know with certainty what diplomatic or propaganda 
objectives are being pursued by the British, but certain issues 
that could be considered close to the truth can be mentioned 
regarding the current British-Iranian relations. The following 
points may help in shedding light on the latest act of 
politico-propagandistic blackmail by Britain: 
  1. Washington encountered defeat in disrupting financial 
dealings between Iran and Japan as well as the European 
countries, which resulted in its losing face on the 
international level. Therefore, Britain in its capacity as the 
European political pillar of the United States resorted to this 
new politico-propagandistic blackmail to unite the Western front 
against Iran. [passage omitted] 
  2. The contempt that Whitehall is sustaining in view of the 
categorical stance of the Iranian leadership and government and 
the British Government's pressure, which it tried to exert by 
various means, has not been able to have the slightest effect on 
Iran's stance on the Rushdie issue. [passage omitted] 
  3. The fact that the latest British propaganda coincided 
with the session of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] 
contact group, especially on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
cannot be considered incidental. 
  It is no secret that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the 
foremost proclaimer of the oppression of the Bosnian Muslims, 
while the British Government is considered among those directly 
to blame among the so-called civilized Western countries for 
this situation. So far all the efforts to lift the embargo 
against the Bosnian Muslims have been foiled by the government 
of Great Britain! [passage omitted] 
  4. Despite our categorical denial of these accusations, and 
while we consider ourselves innocent of any connection with the 
internal crisis in Britain that stems from its domineering 
policies, we cannot refrain from being amazed at the 
double-standard approach of the West in general and Britain in 
particular toward the same matter. How is it that the British 
Government actively supports Iranian terrorist organizations 
whose hands are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent 
Iranian people and officials and there are overt contacts 
between the leaders of these terrorist organizations and the 
British officials? London endorses these meetings and contacts 
without any qualms and considers them symbols of democracy, but 
raises a hue and cry over the "possibility" of Iran's links with 
the IRA. [passage omitted] 
  In our opinion, the latest British ploy stems from the 
weakness and impotence of the Methuselah of 19th-century 
colonialism in resolving its domestic crises and its sheer 
helplessness in the face of the decisive stances of Iran, and it 
is doomed to failure from the outset. 
  Thus, the Islamic Republic of Iran should adopt a more 
aggressive politico-propagandistic policy and should rub the 
nose of the British into the dust and show that country that 
pursuing the policies of the arch-Satan will not benefit it. 
Therefore, it is necessary that this old Methuselah of 
colonialism should relinquish its melancholia [malikhowlia] and 
learn that the protection of the boundaries of countries and 
reciprocal respect in political relations is the primary 
principle of wholesome diplomatic relations and the adoption of 
a policy without dignity that resorts to political machinations 
and false accusations cannot pressure a capable government to 
change its stance.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16 (AFP)--Iran could break ties with 
Britain if London failed to provide a convincing explanation 
over the alleged bugging of the Iranian embassy, MP [Member of 
Parliament] Majid Naderi said Monday [16 May]. 
  Tehran said last Wednesday that a listening device had been 
found late April inside a wall at the Iranian embassy in London. 
Britain has refused to comment on the affair. 
  Naderi, a member of parliament's foreign affairs 
subcommittee, told ABRAR newspaper there was a possibility "of 
any kind of conflict" with London, but that the National 
Security Council would have to give its opinion first. 
  "If the British government does not come up with a 
convincing 
explanation over the spying, a break in relations is possible," 
he said. 
  Tehran has strongly protested against the bugging and said 
it 
would "weaken relations with Britain." 
  Several newspapers here have urged the government to 
reconsider economic ties with Britain, which is Iran's fourth 
biggest trade partner.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- A morning daily here Monday 
[16 May] said that the peace plan proposed by foreign ministers 
of the U.S., Russia and five Western European countries in 
Geneva Friday is nothing but a reward for the aggressor. 
  `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial commented on the peace plan 
according to which 51 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina will go to a 
Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. 
  The peace plan endorsed by the said countries entails 
numerous difficulties wrote the daily, adding that such a 
bisection of the country is quite unfair and amounts to nothing 
less than presenting the aggressor with an award. 
  This is not at all surprising since the entire economic 
structure in the western world is founded on a few basic 
pillars, the daily said. 
  "One of the most critical of these pillars is the arms 
industry which provides, next to the narcotics, the greatest 
amount of revenues for the western countries", the paper added. 
  Naturally an arms industry can thrive only if there are wars 
and aggression, the article noted and added that western 
countries claim that they intend to punish the aggressor and 
bring an end to the war which cannot possibly be true for such a 
policy would deprive them of one of their highly lucrative lines 
of business. 
  That is why seven western countries which are among the 
greatest exporters of arms have rewarded the aggressor in order 
to insure the continued need for their products, wrote the 
article.

  [Text] Holy Mecca, May 15, IRNA -- Following the 
declaration of Dhihajja 4 (this year May 15) as the day of 
solidarity with the Bosnian people, Saudi Minister for Hajj 
Affairs Mahmud Bin-Muhammad al-Safar expressed his opposition to 
the initiative in a note to the head of the Iranian hajj 
pilgrims here today. 
  Al-Safar in his note said he had been informed that Iranian 
hajj headquarters intended to collect aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
through several centers in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah airport. 
  "Since no agreements have been reached on the issue earlier, 
I want you to immediately order the officials of the Iranian 
hajj headquarters to give up the initiative," he said, adding 
"Saudi security agents will ban such efforts." 
  Head of the Iranian Hajj pilgrims Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad 
Mohammad Reyshahri, expressing surprise on the remarks, said the 
Saudi Government raised the issue of helping Bosnian Muslims on 
the one hand, and banned the Iranian pilgrims from collecting 
aid for the Bosnian Muslims on the other. 
  "The issue of collecting aid in the way mentioned in the 
letter is not true," Hoj. Reyshahri said in reply. 
  He said Iranian pilgrims prayed for the victory of their 
Bosnian brothers during a ceremony on Saturday night, when they 
were told that they could donate their aid for the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  A ceremony commemorating the Bosnian martyrs was also held 
at 
the headquarters here today in which Iranian and non-Iranian 
pilgrims expressed their support for their Bosnian brothers and 
sisters. 
  Meanwhile, Saudi commandos, stationed around the 
headquarters 
Sunday afternoon, banned non-Iranian pilgrims from coming to the 
headquarters.

  [Text] His Eminence Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, the eminent 
leader of the revolution, delivered a speech this morning in a 
meeting with people and officials involved in the country's 
press, in which he described the press as very important because 
of the effective and determining role it plays in guiding public 
opinion. He stressed the need for benefiting from the freedom of 
the press to raise the level of knowledge, information, 
farsightedness, insight, and broad-mindedness among the people. 
  The eminent leader said that the country's press community 
embraced the most prominent personalities from the world of 
culture, thought, and the written word, and he said the 
following about the importance of the work carried out by the 
press: The press and all publications hold a special and very 
important position because they play a constant role in guiding 
their readers, and because they influence the actions and 
behavior of society and, for this reason, working for the press 
must not be seen as a mere job. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i went on to say the 
following 
about the duties and responsibilities of the press: The people 
involved with the press must possess greater knowledge, insight, 
and judgement than others with respect to all issues relating to 
daily life and social developments. On this basis, it is their 
duty to convey the required information to the people of this 
country and society, as well as to raise the people's level of 
knowledge in various fields, because the reason why the press 
comes into existence is to spread and publicize human knowledge 
and insight in various subjects. 
  The eminent leader of the revolution stressed that it was 
one 
of the duties of the press to politicize the people and the 
society and he added: In today's world, the press community must 
stride towards politicizing the people and towards propagating a 
spirit of being involved in and caring for politics among the 
people, because the public becomes less vulnerable in a 
politicized society. Increasing the people's capacity for 
political understanding and for analyzing and recognizing 
political trends, tendencies, and motives is a necessity in 
order to confront the ploys and conspiracies of the big news 
agencies; the press must fulfill its responsibilities towards 
this end. 
  Elsewhere in his speech, the eminent leader said that 
another 
duty of the press was to strengthen social ties and national 
unity, as well as to nurture self-confidence and hope in the 
future among all the people, adding: The press must fight 
against disunity, the loss of self-confidence, and the weakening 
of the national spirit, and it must pledge its loyalty to 
anything that leads to a coming together of and unity between 
all the members of the nation; it must strive to preserve our 
national identity and all the foundations of this entity and 
realm. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the country's 
press -- regardless of their normal line -- must adopt a joint 
stance in response to enemy attacks and he said that this was 
one of the duties of a press belonging to the nation, adding: 
Elements within the press community who do not abide by the 
decisive and inviolable responsibilities of the press are guilty 
of injustice and making the press profane. 
  Stating that the freedom of the press today was 
unprecedented 
in the history of Iranian media, the esteemed leader of the 
revolution said: The press in Iran today has a more complete 
freedom in comparison to all other periods and every writer and 
thinker can write and publish whatever he thinks. 
  Referring to unhappiness among some officials regarding some 
publications, articles, and writers as a clear sign for the 
existence of press freedom, the esteemed leader said: Those who 
use the press freedom to bring dissatisfaction among sincere, 
enthusiastic, and selfless officials of the country are 
committing an indecent act but meanwhile some pretend that the 
writers are working under the threat of naked swords. However 
you all know that no naked sword threatens writers and 
journalists. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i called on the press to pay 
attention to the need for discipline, as well as respect for law 
and set limits and said: Those in the press community who 
understand the circumstances and enjoy work ethics must use 
press freedom and the opportunity it provides in full to improve 
popular understanding, knowledge, vision, intellectualism, and 
clear vision, to compensate for the existing underdevelopment 
and to utilize the many existing potentials and the extensive 
material and spiritual possibilities of the country. 
  The esteemed leader of the country said the general 
situation 
with the press in the country, despite some positive points, was 
not satisfactory, and referring to inclinations in the press 
towards populism and popularism added: A press which acts 
according to popular taste can not progress, because in all 
countries the press must be a leader not a follower. 
Furthermore, the press must fight low productivity and value 
the serious writing of articles, analysis, and scientific work. 
  Stating that it was wrong to publish the analytic-type news 
that is produced by Zionist news agencies and broadcasting 
organizations in the country's press, the esteemed leader of the 
revolution said: Many news reports of arrogant news agencies and 
Zionist broadcasting organizations -- which are fully published 
in the Iranian press -- are not truly news, but their biased 
analysis and views which are reproduced in the form of news. 
The Iranian press should therefore be vigilant and should not 
become the instrument of foreign powers' media and it is 
therefore necessary to fully and correctly understand their news 
and publish them only after separating the news essence from the 
analysis. 
  Criticizing some of the country's press for failing to see 
the enmity of the enemies of the Islamic order, his eminence 
Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Neither one of our enemies is 
gentleman-like and we have seen no gentlemanly behavior from 
America, Britain, Zionists, the defunct regime of apartheid in 
South Africa, and the communists. Their ungentlemanly and 
cowardly behavior made us realize and better understand them. 
The enmity of the enemy therefore must not be overlooked 
because it awaits every opportunity to bring down a blow against 
us. 
  Stating that West's intolerance regarding the Islamic dress 
of Muslim women or a true article in their press clearly 
indicated the West's bias and petrification as well as the rule 
of passions and tribal bias in Europe, the leader of the Islamic 
revolution finally said: The press in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran have a truly important position because the strength of the 
country as well as the improvement of civilization and social 
culture depends on the situation of the press and those involved 
in the press must try to execute this great responsibility as 
well as possible. 
  Prior to the speech by the esteemed leader, Mr. Mirsalim, 
the 
minister of culture and Islamic guidance, spoke briefly about 
journalists as the those who recognize the difficulties of the 
country's cultural domain and stressed the need to follow the 
strategy of the esteemed leader in order to fight ignorance, 
inability, decadence, and promote knowledge, thought, research 
and correct understanding.

  [Text] Baghdad, 14 May (INA)--The Political Bureau of the 
Kurdistan Revolutionary Party has condemned the mass 
annihilation scheme whose dirty chapters are being implemented 
by agents Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani against our Kurdish 
people. 
  In a statement, the party called on the honorable Kurds--the 
descendants of Salah-al-Din--to close their ranks, escalate 
their daily struggle, and to trigger the spark of a major, 
comprehensive popular uprising in Kurdistan against the 
murderous agents of foreigners and to liberate Kurdistan from 
their filth. 
  The party called for putting an end to those reckless, 
criminal murderers' encroachments against the Kurds' rights, 
property, and souls and to evict them from the cities to the 
mountains and valleys, where they can fight each other like 
hungry wolves and settle scores any way they want. The lives of 
innocent children, women, and elderly people, whose only fault 
is that they live under the control of those gangs, should be 
maintained. The party appealed for evicting those beasts to the 
mountains and valleys.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's press commentaries focus on U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher's new regional tour, which is aimed 
at boosting and activating the stalemated peace process. 
  In its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: With the beginning of 
Christopher's new tour of the region, it must be reasserted that 
Syria adheres to peace in accordance with the bases that were 
agreed upon in Madrid. Syria will accept no alternative to the 
bases and principles provided for by the UN resolutions and the 
laws of international legitimacy. If Syria insists on 
dismissing partial solutions, this is because its peaceful 
orientation proceeds from one basic axiom--that unless peace is 
just, comprehensive, and based on sound bases of equality and 
equilibrium, it will not be a genuine and firm peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria wants a peace that ensures 
the 
principles and values of truth and justice and ends any form of 
injustice, occupation, and aggression. Syria wants a peace that 
restores rights to their rightful owners and enables the region 
to enjoy true security and stability. Expressing its constant 
readiness to cooperate to achieve a peace of this kind, Syria 
places all those concerned, especially the United States, before 
their historic responsibilities. It asks them to honor their 
promises and assurances and to support the resolutions and laws 
of international legitimacy, which are disregarded by Israel. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Christopher is coming to the region in a 
new effort to activate the peace process, especially on the 
Syrian- Israeli track. However, Israel, through Foreign 
Minister Peres, went ahead of events and cast doubts about any 
possibility of achieving any success in this tour. 
  AL-BA'TH says: In his latest statement, a few hours before 
his new tour of the region, the U.S. secretary of state did not 
show a great deal of optimism about his continuous mission to 
boost and activate the stalemated peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: When the U.S. secretary says that he does not 
hope for much from this tour, this means that he has prejudged 
the results without giving any reasons. Reviewing the reasons 
that may have made Christopher prejudge the results, the paper 
says that the reasons are innumerable. The paper reviews 
Israel's recent stands and attempts to portray itself as 
moderate and flexible. It says that during Christopher's recent 
tour of the region, the U.S. secretary conveyed [to Syria] 
so-called Israeli ideas on withdrawal from the Golan. The ideas 
were listed as concessions, directly linked with conditions that 
have nothing to do with the essence of the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Regarding Israel's alleged concessions, it 
can be stressed that the term concessions is a completely 
rejected political fallacy that the Rabin government is trying 
to peddle in order to mislead domestic and foreign public 
opinion. This is a argument must be rejected because a 
concession is made when someone concedes something that he 
possesses. But, since Israel, the paper says, does not possess 
an iota of the Golan nor any inch of the soil of the occupied 
Arab territories, it has no right to use the term concessions 
anywhere on any issue. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Against this 
backdrop, it is possible to understand the judgment that 
Christopher issued on the eve of his visit to the region. It is 
the judgment of someone who knows the Israeli mentality, which 
insists on obstructing the peace process. For hopes for 
progress to become greater, this situation should be corrected 
and restored to its logical context. In this case, logical 
context is commitment to the essence and principles of the peace 
process. 
  On the same subject, TISHRIN notes that Syria is not ready 
to 
deal with any Israeli proposals that do not show an explicit 
commitment to full withdrawal from the Golan within a reasonable 
and acceptable period of time. The paper adds: Syria has long 
experience with Israel's evasive and intransigent policy. 
Therefore, in view of Syria's constant stands, Israel must have 
realized that partial, phased settlements are not possible and 
that Syria will not relinquish its territory and rights or Arab 
territories and rights. Simply speaking, Syria believes in a 
just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  TISHRIN says: A just, comprehensive peace is one of Syria's 
strategic objectives. Yet, this does not at all mean that Syria 
will relinquish the essence of this peace or accept fragile 
agreements that do not usher in a complete removal of the 
occupation. The paper says that if all parties have the right 
to raise their security concerns, then Syria's security is 
represented primarily in the removal of the occupation and 
providing peace and security for others, especially since it is 
a peace that will be guaranteed by the international community. 
The paper believes that achieving substantive progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track does not require all the complications and 
thorny issues raised by Israel. Syria is proposing a full peace 
in return for full Israeli withdrawal. Peace with Syria means a 
comprehensive Middle East peace. This is because there is no 
peace at all without Syria's participation. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: It is high time the 
United States translated the role of a full, fair, impartial 
partner into reality. This is would be forcing the Israeli 
rulers to make the sound decision without which peace is 
impassible; namely, full withdrawal from the Golan and the other 
occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] Gentlemen: U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will arrive in Damascus today to start a new tour 
designed to give a boost to the peace process. Undoubtedly, 
Secretary Christopher will find in Damascus what he found in 
previous tours, that is, a frank Syrian position on the peace 
process, a definite commitment to UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, a comprehensive view of the just peace, 
and a sincere will to establish peace in a region that has seen 
all kinds of aggression and expansionist policies. He will 
sense an infinite seriousness in dealing with the ideas and 
proposals aiming to implement the UN resolutions and to 
implement, seriously and practically, the bases of the Madrid 
peace conference. 
  It is also expected that when he moves to Israel, Secretary 
Christopher will find there the same position he found in 
previous tours, that is, an ambiguous Israeli concept of the 
peace process; an evasion of, or even contempt for, UN Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338; negligence of the spirit of the 
U.S. initiative; an incomplete view of peace; and a sincere will 
to squander available opportunities, waste time and drain the 
Madrid conference of its content and the peace process of its 
objectives in order to impose the peace Israel wants, tailored 
according to the expansionist schemes and aggressive intentions 
known throughout the entire world. 
  The question that comes to mind in the light of this fact 
is: 
How can the U.S. position, in other words the position of the 
U.S. sponsor, be reconciled with the policy of procrastination 
and obstruction Israel is pursuing? How can this dilemma be 
escaped; a dilemma Israel wants to be a dilemma for the U.S. 
Administration itself? If Israel succeeds in making this a 
dilemma for the United States, it will be able to subdue the 
U.S. initiative and the mediator's role. This would serve its 
own interests in the peace deal it wants, without taking into 
account the credibility of the U.S. position or U.S. interests 
in a region, which is required to enjoy peace. 
  As it receives Secretary Christopher today, Syria is 
stressing that its position supports the just and comprehensive 
peace which can achieve complete Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories, on top of which is the occupied Golan 
Heights; which can return rights to their rightful owners; and 
which can establish objective conditions for a genuine stability 
that would be accepted and even defended by the people, and for 
a peace based on international legitimacy and its resolutions as 
the terms of reference. These must be adopted in order to 
fortify the awaited peace and entrench the desired justice. 
  Syria believes any distortion of this concept or twisting of 
these facts, which are known to the entire world, means a 
departure from the right course and the start of a journey down 
intricate roads that will lead the region to anywhere but peace.

  [Text] Gentlemen: President Hafiz al-Asad presented to 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Syria's viewpoint on 
the peace process and its goal. In light of this, the U.S. 
secretary of state has stressed that the negotiations have 
entered a new and important stage. They also agreed to resume 
the talks when Christopher returns to Damascus. This means that 
the United States is exerting extensive efforts and is also 
eager to take steps that will help the parties involved march 
together on the long road to peace. 
  There is no doubt that Syria welcomes the U.S. efforts and 
hopes the U.S. secretary of state's tour will produce true and 
constructive progress to push the peace process forward. Syria 
also reaffirms the constant principles of a just and 
comprehensive solution and the basic requirements and necessary 
priorities of the peace process. Syria is also eager to achieve 
the full goals of the peace process, and will spare no effort to 
render the U.S. secretary of state's tour successful in order to 
rescue the peace process from the current stalemate it is facing 
as a result of the many Israeli obstacles, which have become 
traps and mines threatening the peace process and pushing its 
toward a deadlock. 
  Any fair observer will not have much difficulty in 
understanding the nature of the Syrian position. Syria's 
position toward the peace process is very clear, and not much 
effort is needed to explain Syria's role and constant 
principles. The entire world is aware of Syria's credibility 
and its sound policy toward the peace process. It also 
understands Syria's correct position and its principles, derived 
from the resolutions of international legitimacy and from the 
need to establish justice and protect the region from shocks, 
trouble, and tension in order to secure a total Israeli 
withdrawal, stability, security, tranquility, and peace in the 
region. 
  Syria opened the way for a real, just, and comprehensive 
peace by agreeing to the U.S. initiative based on the principle 
of land for peace and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, which stipulate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces 
from the occupied Arab territories. During the sixth round of 
the Washington talks, Syria presented a paper of principles that 
was branded as comprehensive and balanced. 
  Syria has formulated its clear and serious position toward 
peace by adopting the principle of total withdrawal in return 
for comprehensive peace. This is a practical and real 
translation of the principle of returning the land to its Arab 
owners. In other words, there will be no peace with occupation, 
and there will be no peace other than just and comprehensive 
peace based on regaining rights. This is the honorable peace to 
which Syria adheres and seeks. 
  The necessary condition for the success of U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's tour lies in Israel's immediate 
response to carry out a total withdrawal from the Golan and 
return it together with its citizens and every inch of land to 
the motherland, Syria. Proceeding from this, it is Israel that 
is required to show goodwill to achieve a just and comprehensive 
peace.

<F P=106> [Statement by Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, Yemeni oil </F>
minister and envoy of Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
to President al-Asad; date not given; from "Weekly File" program 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] We as Yemenis, as well as the brother Syrians and 
all Arabs, regret this event and these problems. The crisis 
continued for more than nine months and it was possible to solve 
it politically within the framework of the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee, especially after this committee succeeded in 
drafting the pledge and accord document, which was considered 
the document of national consensus. It was possible to begin 
implementing this document and consequently resolve the crisis 
and reactivate the work of various bodies. However, 
regrettably, what happened was the opposite of what we expected. 
At a time when the various Yemeni groups were signing the 
agreement, the al-'Amaliqah forces began the battle against the 
Abyan and Aden Governorates. Consequently, it was clear to us 
that there were those who did not wish to implement the 
agreement, particularly the military forces in northern Yemen. 
The next step was the liquidation of units that moved from the 
south to the north, beginning with the 5th Brigade of the Sufyan 
Guards and then the 3d Armored Brigade in 'Imran. The battle 
then spread on a large scale to Dhamar and raged on five axes in 
the direction of Aden. 
  The war was imposed on the Socialist Party and, regrettably, 
the nationalist Yemeni forces. However, the political 
leadership in the Socialist Party, in coordination with the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee, continues to announce to 
all Yemeni, Arab, and international public the need to stop the 
war before anything else and return to dialogue. The language 
of (?force) at the present international circumstances cannot 
solve any problem; dialogue is the right way to solve political 
problems. The battle is now taking place on five axes. 
Yesterday, a new axis was opened at Bab el Mandeb. This is 
detrimental both to Yemen and to international navigation. I 
heard from news agencies that the People's Congress has forces 
about 3 km from Aden. This is untrue and the northern and 
southern forces are engaged in battles 100 km from Aden.

  [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah at al-Rawdah Palace at 1230 
today. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' attended the audience. 
Basindwah conveyed to the president a message from President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Yemeni Presidential 
Council. Talks dealt with Yemeni developments. 
  The president voiced Syria's concern over the bloody events 
in fraternal Yemen and renewed Syria's appeal for the Yemeni 
brothers to renounce fighting and resort to resolving 
differences by brotherly dialogue, out of concern for Yemeni 
unity and the safety and security of the Yemeni people. 
  The Yemeni foreign minister left Damascus at 1630 today. He 
was seen off at Damascus International Airport by Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar', a number of Foreign Ministry officials, 
and the Yemeni embassy staff in Damascus. 
  In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Basindwah said: 
The 
aim of my visit to Damascus was to convey a message from 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to his brother President Hafiz 
al-Asad. Today I was honored to meet with the president. I 
conveyed the message and briefed him on the latest Yemeni 
developments. I found the president fully understanding and 
concerned about Yemeni security and independence. Basindwah 
added: I found President Hafiz al-Asad extremely concerned about 
Yemeni unity. No wonder, President Hafiz al-Asad is one of the 
pioneers of Arab unity. Yemeni unity is a national achievement 
and a pan-Arab gain.

  [Text] Damascus, 15 May (MENA)--Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has stated that the League has 
proposed a peaceful overture for resolving the Yemeni crisis and 
halting the continuing deterioration in the situation there. 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, who is currently visiting Syria, said that 
the message he sent to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
yesterday constitutes an initiative and contains elements that 
would guarantee an end to the crisis. 
  In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Damascus, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid said that the first thing that must be done is end 
the fighting between the brothers there, noting that the Arab 
League is holding intensive consultations and contacts with a 
number of Yemeni leaders on holding a national dialogue instead 
of continuing the internecine fighting. He refused to disclose 
the details of the initiative now, noting that replying to the 
initiative is now in the hands of the Yemeni leaders themselves. 
He stressed that the Arab League is eager to see the delegation 
now in Yemen succeed in its mission. The League, he said, has 
decided to consider its mission in Yemen to be open-ended. In 
the meantime, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid today received a lengthy report 
on the situation and developments in Yemen.

claimed responsibility for the killing of two French religious 
figures in the Kasbah, in Algiers, last Sunday. In its weekly 
publication, the GIA says, I quote, in the framework of the 
policy of liquidation of Jews, Christians, and infidels in the 
Algerian land of Islam, a commando laid an ambush and killed two 
crusaders who have spent many years harming Algeria.

  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has issued 
a statement renewing its rejection of the Cairo agreement that 
has thrown away Palestinian rights. The agreement carries the 
seeds of its failure. What took place in Cairo, the statement 
emphasized, only confirms and lends legitimacy to occupation. 
The anniversary of the proclamation of the Zionist entity on 
our Palestinian territory, which falls tomorrow, Sunday, 15 May, 
comes less than two weeks after the signing of the ill-boding 
Cairo accord, and at a time when our protracted conflict with 
the Zionist enemy is at a crossroads. 
  The scale of the fraud involving demeaning concessions that 
capitulationists have sought to sell to our people is now clear 
to our Palestinian Arab people, and to our Arab and Muslim 
nations. They cannot any longer whitewash the sins and the 
aggression they have committed against our people, cause, land, 
and sacred rights. 
  Hamas emphasized that far from being the end of the road for 
the Palestinian cause, the ill-boding agreement is only the end 
of a stage. Nor does it spell our people's abandonment of the 
option of jihad against the enemy, or the foreclosure of their 
ambitions for which countless martyrs have fallen. The Cairo 
agreement marks the end of a phase in the Palestinian case and 
the end of the patriotic and militant role of the Oslo, Madrid, 
and Cairo faction. 
  Hamas' statement undertook to pursue jihad and the fight for 
liberation and to consolidate national Palestinian unity. It 
promised our people to rally their jihad forces together to cope 
with this decisive phase in our people's history.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, May 13 (AFP)--Rival Yemeni troops battled 
Friday for control of a key town north of Aden, as an Arab 
League team issued an urgent appeal for a ceasefire in the 
week-old civil war. 
  Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
southern forces backing Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid were 
locked in a grim struggle for al-Dali', which lies near the 
former border between the old North and South Yemen. 
  The Sanaa authorities announced Thursday said the town had 
fallen, and a military spokesman said here Friday that "pockets 
of resistance" were being mopped up. 
  Northern reinforcements had been dispatched to al-Dali', 
which lies 90 kilometres (50 miles) north of Aden on a key road 
to a southern air base. 
  But military sources in Aden said southern troops had 
launched a counter-offensive and recaptured some positions 
around al-Dali'. 
  There was also another battle underway in the Kharaz region, 
120 kilometres (75 miles) west of Aden. 
  The defence ministry in Sanaa said northern forces were 
advancing and had inflicted heavy losses on a rival armoured 
brigade. 
  But as the rival communiques continued to fly, southern 
commander Colonel 'Ali Qasim Talib said that the northern 
offensive through Kharaz had been beaten back and the region was 
controlled by al- Bid's men. 
  And as the fighting raged on, an Arab League mission was due 
to hold urgent talks with Salih. 
  Muhammad Bayraqdar, the league's military affairs chief, 
urged Yemen's leaders to "immediately halt" the fighting and 
open a dialogue, which they have so far refused to do. 
  He was to give the president a message to that effect from 
the League secretary-general, Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. 
  Salih and his northern leadership decided to oust al-Bid as 
vice president last week and sacked several southern ministers, 
branding them "secessionists" who should be put on trial. 
  Al-Bid's side in the meantime has demanded the withdrawal of 
northern forces from the south. 
  Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has spoken by telephone with both 
Salih and al-Bid, and Gulf states have issued appeals for an end 
to the fighting, which has shattered the fragile unity of Yemen, 
an impoverished country on the southern tip of the Arabian 
peninsula. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 13 May (INA) -- The Yemeni Defense Ministry 
has dismissed the reported downing of three warplanes of its Air 
Force close to Bab el Mandeb at the Red Sea and the sinking of a 
warship off the port city of Aden. 
  Citing a military source at the Defense Ministry and the 
Staff Command today, the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', denied there 
were any boats in the vicinity, labelling the report mere 
fabrication. 
  The dismissed Yemeni Navy chief, Colonel 'Ali Qasim Talib, 
yesterday, Thursday, announced the separatist forces Wednesday 
shot down three warplanes close to Bab el Mandeb and sank a 
warship. 
  The Defense Ministry said the regular forces are continuing 
their advance in the Kharaz region, 120 km west of Aden city, 
having routed the 25th Mechanized Brigade at Kharaz Camp and 
seized all its weapons and equipment.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of interview with President Muhammad Husni </F>
Mubarak by correspondent Faridah al-Shubashi in Cairo; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Your Excellency, welcome. This is the 
first interview you have granted to Radio Monte Carlo since you 
became the president of Egypt. 
  [Mubarak] Thank you. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, millions watched on television 
the signing of the Palestinian self-rule agreement in which you 
played a major role. Those millions were stunned at the 
critical moment when they noticed there was a difference over 
the signing of a number of maps and documents. We would like 
the president to brief us on the hidden details of these moments. 
  [Mubarak] I want to make something clear. We must know that 
the Palestinian question is over 45 years old. Therefore, it is 
a complicated issue. It became more complicated following the 
emergence of the two frameworks of the Camp David accords. When 
the second framework, which deals with resolving all aspects of 
the Palestinian issue, was reached, the Israeli settlements in 
the West Bank and Gaza were no more than 48 small settlements. 
Today, after approximately 45 years, there are 180 large 
settlements. This further complicates the situation. They want 
to find new places for the settlers who will be moved; they also 
want to decide on the best way of dealing with those who will 
stay and their relationship with the Palestinians in the West 
Bank and Gaza. Therefore, the issue is very complicated and 
other complications will emerge in the coming stages of the 
negotiations. 
  They held negotiations over the details following the 
Declaration of Principles. They spent a long time here to 
discuss these details. They had almost reached an agreement at 
0200 on the day of the signing. We agreed on certain points. 
The problem was over the areas of Jericho and the Gaza Coast. 
They held negotiations until dawn. Meanwhile, I was in my 
office together with the American and Russian officials to help 
them. When we reached a delicate stage, the Palestinian 
brothers and Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] asked for my help. I 
spoke with Mr. Rabin to soften their stand on the issue of the 
coast because we want to solve the problem without undermining 
security. With regard to Gaza, we convinced them to give the 
Palestinians the largest area possible. What is left is 12 km 
for security measures [preceding two words in English]. They 
also added 6.5 km to the area of Jericho. However, after three 
months they [the Palestinians] will take more area. Abu-'Ammar 
objected to these two areas. However, one of the Palestinians 
suggested that even after the signing the talks on the areas of 
Jericho and the Gaza Coast could continue. They said that they 
agreed on this. 
  In the morning, Abu-'Ammar did not sign the map of Jericho 
and the Gaza coast. Mr. Rabin went to sign, but he returned and 
told me that he ['Arafat] did not sign the map. We reached a 
delicate stage. I asked Abu-'Ammar what the problem was. We 
summoned Nabil Sha'th and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and we began 
to talk on podium. We halted the speeches. Rabin said: What 
am I going to say now? Not all the documents are signed. We 
took a break and I spoke with them. I told them: You reached 
an agreement. But, there was no document to confirm the 
agreement they reached that night. They agreed that Rabin and 
Shim'on Peres would write a letter that would be approved by the 
two cosponsors, Christopher and Kozyrev, that they would resume 
the talks after the signing. 
  I believe that three months later, they [the Palestinians] 
will take a larger area in Jericho. When our Palestinian 
brothers go to control [preceding word in English] and make 
plans they will find that the administration on the ground is 
not an easy job. It is easy to talk while you are far away from 
the area, but when you come to the area you will face the 
problems of the people who want to live there. They want 
hospitals, education, and salaries. The new administration will 
face endless problems. Anyhow, we solved the problem within two 
minutes and we returned to the podium where they signed the 
documents. 
  It is natural to face problems even at the last moment 
because of the nature of the problem. The road is still long. 
The Palestinian problem is more complicated than any problem 
with Jordan or Syria. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Your Excellency the President: After achieving 
the Gaza-Jericho step, which is considered the beginning, what 
is your assessment of the peace process and do you expect 
expeditious progress, particularly on the Syrian-Israeli track? 
  [Mubarak] I believe this is the first step with regard to 
the 
Palestinian dimension. I was of the opinion that the 
Palestinians should take the first step. Then, they can start 
the process of confidence-building with the Israelis, so the 
Israelis will be reassured. This is because Israel is sensitive 
about the issue of security for its citizens in order not to 
instigate public opinion against the government. Therefore, I 
can say that 'Arafat made a very courageous decision and Rabin 
also made a very courageous decision in following the path of 
peace. 
  Perhaps it is the circumstances have created such a 
situation, but the Palestine question still has a long way to 
go. They will start discussing the final solution in a few 
years time and they will decide what to do with the settlements. 
It will be a more complicated process. In fact, it is the most 
complicated issue, that of the Palestinian people. 
  With regard to the Syrian track, I wish that during this 
year, or by the end of this year, they will have reached an 
agreement. This is because I believe the Syrian issue now is 
that of mistrust between Syria and Israel. Israel says: I 
would like to know if I will get something in exchange for 
returning the territory, for example. Syria says: In return 
for this thing, what will they give me? Thus, the issue is a 
crisis of confidence. I believe this will take some time. 
However, I wish that by the end of this year they will have 
reached an agreement. By that time, they must have understood 
each other well. Perhaps the Syrian question is not as 
complicated as the Palestine question. It is only the question 
of the Golan. Of course, Israel says: The Golan, yes, but we 
want full normalization of relations [preceding three words in 
English], including opening borders and establishing diplomatic 
relations. So it remains for our brothers in Syria to open 
borders and have an Israeli flag. It will be somewhat 
difficult. When we first had an Israeli flag, the people felt 
uneasy about it, but the people will get used to peace. One 
thing for another. Everything has a price. In the end, 
everything will seem normal. Israel is a state that exists. 
Let us be realistic so as to look toward the future and see how 
our people will live. 
  As for the Jordanian problem, there are some border 
questions, but I believe that the Jordanian problem is on its 
way to being solved. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, what is Your Excellency's reply 
to those who have fears regarding the establishment of a Middle 
East market and their fear that Egypt's regional role will 
recede? 
  [Mubarak] As a matter of fact, I have heard about a Middle 
East market. Whenever anyone makes a statement, you hear many 
analyses and comments. At present, there is no Middle East 
market or anything of this sort. The people want anything to 
talk about. Anyone can raise any topic and then the people will 
start talking about it. This topic was raised by someone, I 
think Shim'on Peres, and the people are talking in detail about 
it. It is we who make the elaboration [preceding word in 
English]. No one will impose anything on us and nothing can 
happen in the region unless we are convinced about it. Egypt 
will stay in the lead of any market. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, what are your expectations 
regarding what is happening in Yemen in light of your intensive 
contacts and efforts to contain the explosive situation? Arab 
and world public opinion is following with extreme interest your 
contacts with the parties of the Yemeni crisis. 
  [Mubarak] As a matter of fact, I spoke with the Yemeni 
president and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid about the 
question of Yemen. I told them: The situation is not 
comfortable. There are forces from the north and south in 
adjacent camps. Please keep the forces away from each other to 
avoid collision, which may lead to armed conflict. If an armed 
conflict begins, it will be very difficult to end it. Even if 
this conflict is halted, many people will have already been 
killed or wounded, and grudges will result, which will lead to 
revenge. Afterward, you will engage in guerrilla warfare. The 
nature of Yemen's terrain is well known. They might fight for 
years and the cycle of revenge could go on for a long time. You 
will reach Aden, and then what? This war will not ensure unity. 
I also told them: War means occupation at a time when you are 
one state. War means a call for secession. Entry into Aden 
would mean occupation, and peoples would view it as occupation, 
and not unity. I cautioned them and then there were rumors that 
Egypt would send forces. We are not prepared to send a single 
soldier to Yemen, whether for peacekeeping or for any other 
purposes. Our forces would be dispatched if there were 
differences among states and when we see that the public 
interest calls for sending peacekeeping forces. This is an 
internal problem there, why send peacekeeping forces? To fight 
whom? I am not prepared to lose anyone in an improper operation. 
  They assure me that the question will be settled. However, 
to tell you the truth, I do not see any hope. I am not biased 
toward one side or the other. I am for peace and stability. We 
are for unity. However, the use of force will never achieve 
unity. It will create revenge operations. Is this part of the 
public interest? The state of affairs in the Arab world is truly 
strange. One country swallows up another; two people unite and 
then strike each other. All of these are aftereffects of the 
Gulf war. It is regrettable and sad. I hope they will reach a 
solution, even though I doubt it. 
  [Al-Shubashi] In light of the deterioration in the Arab 
situation, how much have you accomplished in your efforts to 
close Arab ranks so as to bypass the serious effects of the 
crisis resulting from the Gulf war, and do you believe that 
these efforts are achieving progress? Are the Gulf states 
responding to your efforts in this regard? In other words, will 
Iraq be kept frozen or are there signs of ending the siege 
imposed on Iraq and bringing it back to the international 
community? 
  [Mubarak] There are two points here: Closing Arab ranks and 
the stand on Iraq. 
  With regard to closing Arab ranks, you should not forget 
that 
the occupation of Kuwait and the expulsion of the Kuwaitis were 
a very serious matter, particularly since information indicated 
that they would not have just stopped there and that the 
situation would have developed until it affected the entire Gulf 
region. I did not create this information, reliable sources 
have leaked it in many places. Imagine what would happen if a 
person was expelled from his house, had his belongings seized, 
and was then thrown into the street. It is impossible to 
achieve reconciliation between the two parties in one or two 
years. We are human beings. This is what happened in Kuwait. 
The Gulf states were also scared because after taking Kuwait 
nobody knew where his ambitions would take him. He caused 
chaos. Closing Arab ranks will take long time, because the 
Kuwait war caused deep wounds. I am discussing the matter with 
our brothers. You saw Abu-'Ammar meeting with the custodian of 
the two holy mosques [Saudi Arabian King Fahd]. I spoke with 
the custodian of the two holy mosques and with the Gulf states. 
The situation with Jordan is slightly better now, but this 
needs time. Many countries, which had been helping King Husayn, 
feel bitter over what happened. They believe that King Husayn 
had a role in what happened. But we are trying to clear the 
air, and the situation today is better than it was two years 
ago. The matter, however, will take more time. And the Yemeni 
issue has emerged now. 
  Regarding the issue of Iraq, we are against the partitioning 
of Iraq. There are the northern, southern, and central parts 
now. We sympathize with the Iraqi people. But the 
international community and the Security Council insist on this. 
It is difficult to convince the international community, 
because they would say that the Iraqi president, who was 
responsible for this, is still in power. 
  We are opposed to the removal of a head of state through the 
intervention of foreign powers. The people are the ones who 
should decide whether or not a president should stay in power. 
We can never accept a foreign power removing a head of state. 
I have spoken to certain countries about this issue. Let the 
people, not any foreign power, decide. 
  Lifting the blockade on Iraq is not an easy process and 
requires more time. I hope the people of Iraq will have a 
chance to live. I greatly sympathize with the Iraqi people. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Your Excellency the President, the pioneering 
democratic experiment in Egypt is in the spotlight as it is an 
example to be followed in the region. Will the terrorist 
practices that are aimed at aborting the democratic march 
followed by Egypt under your leadership affect this march? 
  [Mubarak] Nobody can alter the democratic march. If it could 
be changed those terrorist elements and those behind them would 
have achieved something. We are keen on democracy and freedom. 
We tried all... [sentence incomplete as heard]. There has 
never been freedom like that which exists in Egypt now, not even 
under the monarchy, and not before or after. I am fully 
convinced that what we are doing will not arrest this pluralism 
and democracy. What we are doing is in line with the 
Constitution and the law. I do not like to violate them at all, 
because I am establishing bases for the future. If another 
person were in my place he might become nervous about all these 
practices and abort this democracy. But, if we did this, we 
would enter again into a vicious circle. I am against this. I 
support liberties. You notice that some papers here never 
stop... [sentence incomplete as heard]. Yesterday, they told me 
that a paper is calling for confusion. I want the Egyptian 
people to learn, to know right from wrong, and to discern good 
from bad. How can our nations learn? If I put an end to this 
process people will ask in case of any problem: Where is the 
government? Where is the government? 
  In the past, when any official was criticized -- and this 
happened when I first assumed office -- the official would come 
to me and tell me: Mr. President, they say this and that about 
me. But I am not the target. Rather, it is the regime. I 
would answer: Brother, may God damn this regime if it is unable 
to defend itself. Do you want the president to reply to every 
writer who attacks the regime for a mistake? No, every member 
of the regime who works properly must take criticism and reply 
if this criticism is not correct. Reply to it. We are 
concerned about democracy and freedoms. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, before you won another term as 
president, you stressed your concern for the problems of 
low-income employees and you stressed the need to quickly 
improve social conditions so as to deepen political and economic 
stability and stem the roots of terrorism. To what extent is 
the state following the opinion and studies of experts in all 
fields regarding the problems of unemployment, poor regions, 
education, and other questions? 
  [Mubarak] I want to tell you one thing. When I assumed 
office in October 1981, I was not aware of the circumstances. I 
started to make studies to see how the situation was in general. 
I found that after the wars, if we were to continue that way, 
there would be no infrastructure. In Cairo schools you would 
see students wearing boots and wading in water. There was no 
water in homes; there was no electricity. If you took the 
Alexandria train, it would take you five hours and the train 
would break down. There were no roads, no telephones, nothing 
at all. The population was increasing. And if you want 
investment without solid infrastructure, no one will come. I saw 
many investors who came here to do business. When they wanted 
to call their company abroad to make a study, they would find 
the telephone dead. If the telephone was working, the operator 
would say to wait for a week or five days until you get a line. 
So Egyptian and non-Egyptian investors came here and found out 
there was nothing to be done. I saw these things. So I called 
an economic conference in March 1982, I think. I brought all 
the economists of the country together. We came up with a plan, 
which we have been following up until today. We introduced 
amendments to the plan from time to time. The country needs 
billions for the infrastructure. If I want to construct a 
building, I must have strong foundations. If I want to build a 
country, I must have strong foundations: water, sewage systems, 
telephones, electricity, etc. This is because no investors will 
come if there is no electricity; no investor will come if he 
cannot make a telephone call to order spare parts through DHL or 
via any other means quickly; no investor will come knowing there 
is no means of transportation; no investor will come when there 
are no industrial zones for him to build. So we started from 
the basic infrastructure. We did not have enough money. We 
barely eked out a living. So what could we do? Are we to leave 
the country this way, or is it better to get loans to build the 
infrastructure so the country can revive and then repay the 
money when our situation improves? We started with the 
infrastructure. We set priorities: water, electricity, and 
telephones. Some people would say: But, Mr. President, why 
don't you work on one project and finish it? Such as water. But 
if we do this, does the water not need drainage systems? What 
about electricity? This is an integral process. We started 
with the basic infrastructure for several years. The problem of 
the poor regions has existed since the sixties, or even before 
that. We have always had low-income people and poor people. The 
world is full of them. You have them in France, the United 
States, Britain. Name one country that does not have poor 
people. Unemployment? Name one country that does not have 
unemployment. All of this is the result of advanced technology 
and such things. We are not any different. We have covered a 
considerable distance in the infrastructure. When I assumed 
office, we had half a million telephone lines, including 300,000 
lines that were not working. As for the 200,000 lines that were 
working, I had to lift the receiver and place it next to me and 
drink tea waiting for the dial tone just to make a quick call. 
If I reached a wrong number, then I had to place the receiver 
back to wait for the tone. So it was better and quicker for a 
person who wanted to speak with a friend on the telephone to go 
on foot and see his friend and come back. 
  Today, we have 3 million telephone lines. In the past, if 
you wanted to speak with another country for any reason, you 
could not. Today, you can talk to Japan, the United States, and 
any other country in the world from any telephone. So we now 
have 3 million lines, compared to the half million lines we had 
from time the telephone was introduced to Egypt. 
  The same thing goes for water and electricity. We had 4,700 
megawatts of electricity. Electricity used to go off, and 
during examinations, the people would get angry because there 
was no electricity and they could not get a lamp. Today, we 
have 14,000 megawatts. Electricity production when I first 
assumed office in late 1981 was 18 billion kilowatts; today, we 
have 75 billion kilowatts. In December, it will become 80 
billion kilowatts. 
  In 1952, the Egyptian citizen used around 50 kilowatts; in 
1970, I think, 400 kilowatts; today, the individual uses 1,000 
kilowatts. Do you see the difference? The Shubra al-Khaymah 
power station alone cost us 3.3 billion pounds. No power 
station costs less than 2.5 billion pounds. These are huge 
stations. That one cost us a lot. Then, we faced some crises. 
There was no hard currency; the price of oil was going down; we 
were not exporting a lot because there weren't many industries. 
All of this created problems. God made things easier for us. 
Half of the debts are gone. Things started to improve. We 
then started looking at our priorities. The poor regions. I 
could not have done anything in the past because I had no money. 
Where can we get the money? Are we to get money out of 
nowhere? So I had my priorities: water, roads, and new cities 
for the industries and agriculture, so the people can get on 
with their life. But if I had huge financial resources, we 
would have addressed all problems. Take unemployment. It 
exists everywhere in the world. And we have also had 
unemployment throughout history. Increases in the population 
also contributes to unemployment. But if I have the figures I 
would tell you that over the past few years, we managed to find 
jobs for over 2 million people. And we are finding other jobs, 
despite the difficulties involved and the modern technologies 
that reduce the number of necessary workers. We are doing our 
best here. We have new cities that have many industries. We 
have 13 more new cities than in 1981. They include 6 Uktubar; 
10 Ramadan; al-Nubariyah; an agricultural community; al-Salhiya, 
an agricultural community; Burj al-'Arab, 
agricultural-industrial; al-Sadat, agricultural-industrial 
community; the Bani-Suwayf. We have many huge complexes. We 
have 13 new complexes. Houses and factories have been built in 
these complexes. There are around 100 factories in 10 Ramadan 
Complex. These factories provide job opportunities for many 
people and provide housing for many people. We are doing our 
best within our means to provide jobs. But we have a burden. 
The Egyptians do not want to work in the private sector. In the 
past, the private sector did not pay the people steady salaries. 
They would just give you a bonus and tell you good bye. Today, 
there is security if you work in the private sector, as well as 
in the government. But in our case, part of the unemployed work 
in the private sector. Despite this, they apply for a job with 
the government. I once asked a graduate who had been working 
for two or three months: My son, how much do they pay you? He 
gets 280 pounds and a bonus and other allowances. He then told 
me: Mr. President, I have applied for a job with the 
government. I told him: The government will appoint you in 
al-Jizah, al-Fayyum, or some other place. He said: I want to 
speak to Your Excellency, maybe a member of the People's 
Assembly would get me a transfer. I told him: Do you expect 
all the people to be appointed in the same place? You get a 
good salary. He wants to stay in the private sector and to work 
with the government and get all the benefits. I met an engineer 
once who visited me at home a few years ago. He told me: Mr. 
President, my salary is not enough. I asked him: Where do you 
work? He said: I work at an engineering office with the 
government in a certain governorate. I asked him: My son, do 
you go to work? He said: We are 10 in the office and we have an 
agreement between us, so I go two or three days in the week. He 
said my salary is not enough for me to eat in the club. I asked 
him: What club? He said: Well, the days on which I do not go 
to work, I stay in the club and the lunch is not enough. 
  I told him: My son, why don't you find another job in the 
afternoon. I gave him the following example. An engineer once 
came to me to build [word indistinct] air base at the airport. 
The engineer works in the private sector in the morning and at 
an engineering office in the afternoon. He was still young. He 
told me that he would fix the [word indistinct] better than any 
other engineer. I told him: Sure. Here is a tender. I asked 
them to give the tender to him and to help him. The young man 
worked hard and earned a good amount of money. He was happy, 
and I was happy for him. Another does not want to go back to 
Egypt and works at an engineering office. But this engineer 
works in the morning and in the afternoon. He earned around 
2,000-3,000 pounds in two or three years. He worked hard from 
morning to evening. 
  So the question of unemployment, no country can solve this 
problem overnight. The French prime minister said in an 
interview: Don't think that unemployment will end overnight. It 
needs years. You can't push a button and create jobs. If you 
take the government jobs, there are many problems: salaries and 
bonuses. You look at the state budget, you find that half of it 
is salaries. Employees who do not do anything complain that 
bonuses are getting smaller. This is because you cannot 
distribute all the money. 
  Someone will tell you: I am facing hardship; the salary is 
not enough. Okay. The government is facing a hard time, and he 
also wants to get a job with the government. But where do we 
get you a salary or office? We will not find chairs for them to 
sit on. Some people tell you: I do not find an office for me. 
Everybody wants an office and a chair to obstruct the people's 
formalities. When someone visits him, he will be too busy 
talking on the telephone and telling the people to come tomorrow 
or after tomorrow. You know this familiar stuff. All this is 
because of the huge number of workers. we have a huge number of 
employees and this burdens the economy because these employees 
are not productive. However, those who work at the factories 
are productive and the country depends on those people. 
  If someone says: I can solve the problem of unemployment 
overnight, we will tell him that this is impossible. The 
population is increasing. In all my interviews and meetings, I 
warn of the danger of this increase. Maybe we are coping with 
this increase now. However, in the long run, the country will 
suffer on account of the increase of its population. You will 
not find jobs and we will run into trouble. So regarding the 
question of unemployment, we have always had this problem. 
  Also, the poor regions have existed since 1924. In the 
1960's and 1970's, they increased. But I have no resources to 
build better homes and provide services. When I have 100 pounds 
and have many problems, I have to set my priorities. We are 
trying to solve the question of unemployment and the question of 
education and many other issues. 
  As for low-income people, it is our job to help those 
people. 
When someone has a factory and earns money, we start attacking 
this man because he has money and has a nice car. We tell them 
that the one who has money and has a Mercedes or another fancy 
car, this man is helping his country because he is investing his 
money here and hiring people and we must encourage him. Since 
he earns a good sum of money, he wants to have a decent living. 
Otherwise, he will leave this country and go somewhere else. 
So, let him have a Mercedes 1000. Why not? He pays duty of 
more than 1 or 2 million pounds. This money goes to the state 
budget for the low-income people. Let him buy 10 cars. This 
way, we will have 20 million pounds for the low-income people. 
  I encourage the rich people who invest their money in the 
interest of the people, not those who become rich through 
illegal methods, such as drugs and corruption. I am against 
those all the way. We will never accept this. I encourage 
patriotic capitalists who invest their money and create jobs for 
people. Why do I give exemptions to the owners of private 
projects? I recently told them that anyone who starts a project 
worth 10 million pounds will be exempted from taxes. Why? 
Because he will create jobs for 10, 15, or 20 families. This 
is better than taking taxes without solving the problem. If you 
employ 10 or 50 people, you will support 10 or 50 families. 
  Solving problems will take time. I have great piles of 
problems. Praise be to God, one shouldered all this heavy burden 
and solved many problems. Now, we are in a better situation. 
There are endless problems. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Mr. President, you spoke about your direct 
contact with the masses and their problems. You noted the 
problems facing bureaucracy in the government. Many 
intellectuals speak about corruption as one of the major causes 
of frustration and its detrimental effects. Meanwhile, the 
government reiterates its endeavor to combat corruption 
regardless of posts because everyone is equal before the law. 
Have the people felt this in a performance that reflects the 
government's policy aimed at confronting corruption? 
  [Mubarak] I would like to tell you something. Corruption 
exists among human beings wherever they are. Egypt is one of 
the countries that suffers the least from corruption. There is 
not a single crime of corruption that the state has not 
monitored or followed. I wish that those who are talking about 
corruption would reform themselves first. Some people talk 
loudly about corruption in order to cover up their own 
corruption. I do not want to mention names. We are one of the 
cleanest countries. The baser self of man incites to evil. 
Name one country where there are only angels. Freedom and 
democracy allow the press to write about corruption. However, 
this is not the case. Did corruption not exist in the past? 
There was corruption in the past, but nobody dared to open his 
mouth. Corruption exists, but we are the ones who reveal it 
before public opinion and send people to court. The important 
thing is that the government does not cover up any case. We 
speak about corruption a great deal because there is nothing to 
talk about. If you know about a corruption case inform the 
competent authorities about it. The court will look into such 
cases, and we do not intervene in the work of judiciary. We 
have never asked the public prosecutor to cancel any corruption 
case. Some people are acquitted by the court and others are 
found guilty. It does not matter whether those involved are 
relatives or friends of the president, or a minister, or 
official. This is the principle. 
  [Al-Shubashi] The administrative apparatus, Mr. President? 
  [Mubarak] When there are many officials in the government 
there will be many problems. Name me one country in the world 
where there is no bureaucracy. The public money makes people 
act like this. Those in charge know that they are held 
accountable. But the owner of a sum money is not scared because 
it is his money. A government employee will tell a citizen to 
come the next day because he is afraid of signing a document. 
This is one of the reasons. The government employees are too 
many therefore there are complications. When I was a vice 
president, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter told me that your 
bureaucracy has been delaying the implementation of a deal to 
buy buses for six months. I told him: Mr. President, we turned 
over the documents to you three months ago. You also have 
bureaucracy like ours, and maybe more. He said: Maybe. 
[preceding word in English] I told him: Not maybe. [preceding 
word in English] The documents were turned over to you three 
months ago. There is bureaucracy in any government in the 
world, because public money is involved. When private money is 
involved the situation is different. I confirm that Egypt is 
one of the cleanest countries in terms of corruption. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Some of the decisions made by low-level local 
leaders favor extremism by submitting to the demands of 
extremists in an effort to strike a balance between the 
government and tne extremists. What is the stand of the higher 
leadership toward these leaders? 
  [Mubarak] This might happen occasionally, but it is not a 
phenomenon. Praise be to God, people are well aware of what is 
happening, they know what is good and bad. 
  [Al-Shubashi translates into Arabic a question in French 
from 
the director of Radio Monte Carlo] Your Excellency the 
President, Radio Monte Carlo is a French station. Therefore, we 
are interested in knowing the state of diplomatic relations 
between Egypt and France. In another development, President 
Mitterrand yesterday celebrated the passage of 13 years since he 
assumed power. Do you want to address a message on this 
occasion? 
  [Mubarak] Our relations with France are excellent. I visited 
France for this first time in September 1974 when I was the 
commander of the Air Force. In the past, we were sent to the 
East. That was my first visit to London and Paris. Since then, 
I have wished everything good for France. I visited France in 
June 1975 when I was the vice president. I was one of those who 
always worked to strengthen relations with France as it is a 
leading European country. I have also visited France many times 
since and I, sometimes, reconciled issues between President 
d'Estaing and President al-Sadat when they differed. I spoke 
frankly with President d'Estaing, who always accepted what I 
said because I sought good relations with France. There is 
continuous cooperation with France in many fields. France has 
been our partner in a subway project and in many industries. We 
have the best relations with France. It supports us in 
international bodies, such as the IMF and the World Bank. 
President Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, and the French 
brothers are good supporters in this regard. 
  On this occasion, I greet President Mitterrand as a friend. 
When I was vice president, I visited President Mitterrand when 
he was elected as president in 1981. My visit to France 
coincided with a visit by the head of an Arab state. Mitterrand 
changed the time of the meeting so as to meet me before the head 
of an Arab state. Before this, I met him here in Cairo when he 
was a party leader. Since then, I can say that our relations 
have been good. I am very frank, and he can be trusted. Since 
then, our relations have been good. My relations with Jacque 
Chirac and Giscard d'Estaing are excellent. In fact, my 
relations with the French leaders are very good, because they 
are frank and clear. I greet President Mitterrand on the 13th 
anniversary of his assumption of power. He is one of the 
greatest politicians I have ever met. 
  [Al-Shubashi] It is known that you listen to local and world 
radios. What is the share of Radio Monte Carlo in this? 
  [Mubarak] When I was vice president, I wanted to make some 
remarks on Radio Monte Carlo. There were some incomplete news 
reports broadcast that would cause harm. I regretted this 
because relations with France were good. I did not mean that 
the news on Egypt should be inaccurate. I support true news. 
However, after contacting our brothers in Radio Monte Carlo, 
they understood the situation and broadcast unbiased facts. It 
is one of the stations that I always listen to and its news is 
very balanced. This does not mean that it aims at appeasing 
Egypt. It broadcasts true news. Some stations broadcast 
incomplete reports, thereby giving the wrong information. I 
believe Radio Monte Carlo does no do this. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Your Excellency the President, thank you for 
this testimony of which we are proud. Thank you for giving us 
this long time. We hope we will meet Your Excellency again. 
  [Mubarak] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
renewed his call to Yemeni leaders to stop the fighting and 
resort to dialogue, stressing that war solves nothing. 
  In a statement to be published in the 16 May issue of the 
newspaper MAYU, President Mubarak said: Stop the fighting. War 
terminates unity; it does not preserve it. The Yemeni people 
are paying the price with their own blood and their vital 
installations, which are being destroyed. War will solve no 
problem anywhere, even if one side triumphs over another. The 
basis is always dialogue. 
  He added: We have always advised them not to resort to 
military force. We said unity must be achieved with the consent 
of the people. 
  Regarding the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, President Mubarak 
said: 
The Palestinian people are happy with this agreement. We are 
also happy to see that our Palestinian brothers have begun to 
restore their land and return to it in accordance with this 
agreement, which was the result of long and exhausting talks. 
  Referring to the crisis that occurred during the signing 
ceremony for the agreement in Cairo on 4 May, Mubarak said: 
What happened on the day of the signing of the agreement in 
Cairo--the dispute over the maps, their not being signed, and 
then our return to the stage after bridging the gaps--is the 
most eloquent proof of the efforts we all exerted and the 
strenuous talks that ended with the signing of the agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter: "Jordan Ready To </F>
Give Humanitarian Aid to Yemen but No Mediation"] 
  [Text] Amman -- His Majesty King Husayn has reiterated 
Jordan's readiness to provide humanitarian assistance to Yemen 
but said the Kingdom would not interfere in the internal affairs 
of the war-torn Arab Peninsula country. 
  During a meeting with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah, who paid a brief visit to the Kingdom Thursday [12 
May], the King expressed concern with maintaining the unity of 
Yemen and ending the bloodshed between forces loyal to South 
Yemeni leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. 
  Mr. Basindwah, who is on a tour of Arab countries to inform 
them of the developments in the Yemeni conflict, left Jordan for 
Damascus after delivering to King Husayn a verbal message from 
Mr. Salih. 
  In an arrival statement carried by the Jordan News Agency, 
Petra, Mr. Basindwah praised the role Jordan played in trying to 
mediate the crisis between former socialist South Yemen and the 
Conservative North before the political crisis there erupted 
into full-fledged civil war earlier this month. 
  "Jordan entered the Yemeni history" when in February it 
hosted the signing of a reconciliation agreement between Mr. 
Salih and Mr. al-Bid, said Mr. Basindwah. 
  He also thanked the Kingdom for treating some of the wounded 
in the war, which has claimed thousands of casualties since it 
started 11 days ago. Jordan has also sent a medical team to 
help treat war victims. 
  After the war erupted, North Yemen rejected any foreign 
mediation effort, insisting on a military settlement of the 
conflict, but indicated it would accept a negotiated settlement 
to the crisis after it had become clear that it will not be able 
to achieve a military victory. 
  An Arab League delegation was on its way to Sanaa in a bid 
to 
end the conflict but Mr. Basindwah said the league did not offer 
mediation. its delegation would only "review developments in 
the situation in Yemen," he said. 
  Prime Minister Abd al-Salam al-Majali has said that Jordan 
would not mediate in the conflict unless both parties to it 
agree on the Kingdom's role, adding that Jordan would not 
"interfere in support of either parties to the crisis." 
  Dr. al-Majali said King Husayn had telephoned both Mr. 
al-Bid 
and Mr. Salih in a bid to end the fighting but North Yemen sees 
any foreign intervention as meddling in its internal affairs. 
  Jordan has evacuated over 750 Jordanians from Yemen on board 
military aircraft, and Royal Jordanian (RJ) airliners. RJ has 
halted its flights to the country, which observers say would be 
dragged into a protracted civil war unless a negotiated 
settlement is found.

  [Text] The Jordanian-Palestinian Economic Committee, which 
began its work last Tuesday [10 May], ended its meetings at the 
Prime Ministry today. The Jordanian side was led by Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information 
minister, and the Palestinian side was led by Ahmad Quray', head 
of the PLO Economic Department. Details are in the following 
report: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In a statement 
to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY following the end of these 
meetings, Dr. al-'Anani said the meetings were obviously aimed 
at focusing on the substance of issues and finding detailed, 
practical solutions in order to be able to provide the required 
practical climate for starting a new stage of economic 
cooperation on clear-cut bases and bolstering the Jordanian and 
Palestinian economies. 
  He said: We have agreed on many basic points in several 
areas of cooperation. But, he added, there are still two points 
which the Palestinian brothers feel they should study further 
and that they might clarify with the Palestinian leadership. He 
said the two points revolve around ways of coordination to 
license new banks, dealing with the Jordanian dinar, and 
settling payments between the two sides. Dr. al-'Anani 
explained that these points are not a subject of dispute, but 
that they remained outstanding, pending a settlement. He 
expressed hope that this will take place in the near future, and 
said that if these two issues are settled, we will have 
accomplished something extremely important to prepare for the 
comprehensive concept of economic cooperation. 
  He added: We have agreed that after settling issues 
pertaining to trade, customs tariff, transit, tourism, issues 
related to the monetary and banking sector, and arrangements to 
encourage the private sectors on both sides to cooperate, we 
should move to another stage soon to discuss other issues, like 
agriculture, industry, transportation, and the contract sector 
in a detailed manner. He also explained that it has been agreed 
in principle that the private sector's activities should occupy 
a leading and clear position in cooperation and promoting 
economic exchange. 
  Dr. al-'Anani expressed his thanks to and appreciation for 
the Palestinian side for its seriousness and its sincere desire 
to reach cooperation and joint concepts about various issues 
under discussion. 
  For his part, Quray' told the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY: Over 
the past days, we have held brotherly, sincere, and serious 
talks on various issues of interest to us during the next stage 
in order to support and assist the Palestinian authority to deal 
with its burdens. Quray' also said: The most important 
agreement we reached during these meetings is that we decided 
that trade between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Palestine 
should be free and should be exempted from all fees and taxes, 
except every side's practices regarding its national product. 
  He added that it was also agreed that a free zone will be 
established in the Jordan Valley to assist both sides' farmers 
to store and process the agricultural products' surpluses and to 
contribute to other projects. 
  Regarding banks and currency, he said: We have fully agreed 
on licensing all the Jordanian banks in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. It was also agreed that the Jordanian dinar would be the 
main currency to be used, not just one of the currencies, and 
would be the tool of registering and paying to the Palestinian 
authority. He added: We also agreed to form subcommittees on 
trade, currency, banks, and tourism, which we hope will begin 
meetings as soon as possible. He added: There are still some 
points that need more clarification from the Palestinian 
leadership, and we will work for that purpose during the next 
two days and will return to resume our meetings. He said: The 
session was adjourned and will be resumed very soon. Quray' 
said that what is left is a discussion of the details and 
translating the approved working program into facts, as well as 
monitoring our ability to implement, develop, and expand it in 
the future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Christopher's Visit to Syria"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrives 
in Damascus today. He will be meeting with Zionist authorities 
tomorrow after his talks with Syrian officials. During his 
visit Christopher will convey the views of the Zionist regime's 
authorities to Syrian officials and take their response back to 
Tel Aviv. The aim of Christopher's visit is to bring closer the 
two sides' positions on the Zionist regime's proposal for a 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights by shuttling between Damascus 
and Tel Aviv. 
  During an earlier visit to the region by Christopher, the 
Zionist regime proposed promoting a spirit of compromise in the 
region. The proposal tried to eliminate the obstacles in the 
way of talks with Syria. Syria has linked any talks with the 
Zionist regime to that regime's withdrawal from the occupied 
Golan Heights. The Zionist regime has proposed a gradual 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, with the withdrawal carried 
out over a 10 year period rather than in a single step. Syrian 
officials responded by describing the proposal as a plan for 
postponing rather than resolving the issue. Stressing their 
constant stance, they emphatically called for a swift and total 
withdrawal from the Golan region. 
  At the moment, after the signing of the accord between 
'Arafat and the Zionist regime, officials of the Zionist regime 
and the White House expect Syria to display more flexibility 
about starting talks and announce its agreement with the 
proposals that have been put forward. Syria, however, taking 
into account the expansionist nature of the Zionist regime, is 
doubtful about the proposed plans, which defer a withdrawal from 
the Golan Heights. 
  The Zionist regime has always discussed expanding its 
borders 
by making pretexts such as maintaining its security and 
self-defense, and raises the issue as a vital and strategic 
objective. That is why it is futile to hope for that regime's 
withdrawal at a time when it has received all the concessions. 
  On the other hand, although the U.S. is ostensibly exerting 
pressure in a responsible way for talks to begin between the 
Zionist regime and the Syrian authorities, the Syrians are not 
sure that after the talks the necessary pressure on the Zionist 
regime will be exerted for its withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights, even for a gradual withdrawal. That is why the Syrians 
are as doubtful of the U.S. guarantees that any agreements will 
be implemented as they are suspicious of Israel professed 
willingness to carry out its undertakings. 
  The liberation of the occupied areas is among Syria's vital 
objectives. For reasons of security as well as of honor, Syria 
is compelled not to agree to any postponement of the liberation 
of the occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] Even though the war in Yemen has entered its second 
week, it has not brought any military gains for the two sides. 
Yesterday, the north Yemen officials rejected the south Yemen 
proposals for an immediate cease-fire and the establishment of a 
national salvation government. In turn, they asked Salim al-Bid 
and other southern officials to surrender. 
  According to an official spokesman in Sanaa, the capital of 
north Yemen, the cease-fire proposal by the Yemeni Socialist 
Party--that is, the southern officials--is not new. On the 
other hand, reports from the south indicate that the war is 
accomplishing nothing, in view of the balance of the military 
forces. 
  Yesterday, following a clash that took place near the mouth 
of the Red Sea, the southern officials issued a military 
communique reporting the downing of three northern warplanes. 
This clash occurred on the former border of the two Yemens in 
the vicinity of the Bab al-Mandab strait. According to the 
southern forces, the pilot of one of the planes is alive and has 
been taken captive. 
  Despite the fact that the role of foreign elements in 
fomenting and intensifying the crisis in Yemen has been 
repeatedly hinted at by neutral political circles, the two 
warring sides in Yemen continue the war--with heavy human and 
material losses--with no thought to the adverse repercussions of 
their actions. 
  The Yemeni nation should be aware that in this illogical 
war, 
the sides involved continue to be the losers. It is the 
elements behind the scenes who succeed in attaining their 
coveted interests. 
  Political experts believe that in the sensitive region of 
which Yemen is a part, all kinds of crises and unrest are a 
justification for the continued U.S. military presence. This 
presence, which has caused unease in many regional countries 
after the Iraqi crisis had subsided, needs new justifications. 
Therefore, the people of Yemen... [commentary ends in

  [Text] Algiers, May 15 (AFP) -- The chairman of the 
Arab-Islamic Rally party has been murdered after being abducted, 
press reports said here Sunday [15 May]. 
  Laid Grine, 49, who was also an Algiers lawyer, was found 
Saturday morning near Algiers with his throat cut, the reports 
said. 
  The lawyer had been captured the previous day by 
unidentified 
abductors from his house at Bordj El Mokhfi east of Algiers. 
  There has been no official response to his kidnapping and 
murder, but press reports said he had succeeded Wednesday in 
gaining the acquittal of an Islamic fundamentalist being tried 
by one of the country's special "anti-terrorism" courts.

<F P=106> [Report by Kamal al-Tawil: "Algerian Salvation Front </F>
Welcomes U.S. Administration Positions"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The (disbanded) Islamic Salvation 
Front [FIS] yesterday welcomed recent U.S. positions on Algeria. 
It described them as "characterized by objectiveness and 
maturity." It vehemently criticized France, advising it to be 
"neutral." 
  A senior FIS official told AL-HAYAH that France knows that 
the FIS is "an Algerian party which won the elections twice 
(municipal and legislative)." He expressed his surprise at 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's statement describing the 
FIS as "a terrorist organization" hostile to Europe and the 
West. The official said: "We consider this statement 
unjustifiable interference in Algerian affairs and blatant bias 
toward the current regime in Algeria." He went on: "Let France 
know that the change in Algeria is taking place on Algerian 
territory and through the will of the people. France might 
through its conspiracies manage to limit the speed of the 
change, but it is impossible to stop the change. Thus we say 
once again that it is better for France to be neutral if it 
cannot side with the people." [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the U.S. position, the FIS official said that 
the Clinton administration's position "has recently been 
characterized by objectiveness and maturity." He went on: "In 
its dealings with the outside world, the FIS takes account of 
every state's position on its conflict" with the Algerian 
regime. This is why "we are interested in knowing at the time 
of crisis who supports the people's freedom and who wants them 
to live under suppression." 
  Asked about the marches staged a week ago in support of the 
dialogue in Algeria, and whether the FIS took part in them, he 
said: "The FIS cannot ask people to take to the street" in 
support of the marches while the "operations of repression 
continue to be launched against FIS supporters or those thought 
to belong to it." [passage omitted] 
  On the development of the dialogue between the authorities 
and the FIS, the official said that, "if a negotiated solution 
is wanted to move a step forward, (President Major General 
Liamine) Zeroual must keep his pledge and thus release the 
cheikhs (FIS leaders). Negotiations must be held with them, and 
no one else."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi paid 
an unexpected visit to the police station of El Anasser, where 
he was briefed by the station chief on the difficult conditions 
in which policemen carry out their mission to guarantee the 
public's safety. 
  [Begin Sifi recording] We will look into the means 
available. 
God willing, we will make an effort to provide you with the 
means in all fields. We will have to be realistic and bear in 
mind the circumstances and the means available to the state. 
We, as a government, and also the people notice that the 
policemen are sacrificing their lives to defend this homeland so 
that it can remain a state of law. The main thing is that this 
is a noble mission that concerns the defense of one of the basic 
human rights. Many people talk about human rights but we should 
not forget that the main and the most crucial human right is the 
right to life, and the defense of this right is a noble mission. 
  This mission is carried out by the police and all security 
corps who have sacrificed so much for the state and for Algeria. 
Algeria will not forget these sacrifices, which aim to protect 
the citizens and their property and defend this nation and this 
people. I must say and stress that the state, with Mr. Liamine 
Zeroual at its head, is opposing this violence and will continue 
to do so until the situation quiets down and things return to 
normal and until stability is restored, God willing. This will 
be relentless until stability and tranquillity are restored so 
that we can let our people choose their representatives. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Labor Party Deputy Yosi Katz and PLO </F>
representative 'Ahmad al-Tibi by Robert Hochner in Vienna -- 
live; Katz and al-Tibi speak in English with superimposed German 
translation] 
  [Text] [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, how do you assess the 
handing over of power from Israel to the PLO so far, and what is 
the next major objective you want to negotiate with the Israelis? 
  [Al-Tibi] We are here in Vienna, both Israelis and 
Palestinians, at the invitation of the Bruno-Kreisky-Forum to 
negotiate the touchy issue of the final status, which means the 
issues of Jerusalem, the settlements, refugees, the right to 
return, borders, etc. These are the most difficult issues. I 
can tell you that the first day has already brought very 
productive and constructive discussions, particularly on the 
issues of refugees and the return of refugees. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Katz, Jerusalem has always been an integral 
part of Israel, the capital of Israel for the Israeli Government. 
  [Katz] I hope that Jerusalem remains united and under 
Israeli sovereignty. Yet, this is one of the controversial, 
sensitive issues. Of course, we are discussing this issue, too, 
as well as other issues that create difficulties for the 
Palestinians. This is in the very nature of mutual talks. We 
must also discuss controversial issues, because otherwise, we 
will not reach an agreement. 
  [Hochner] One of the controversial issues is the settlements 
on the West Bank. Can you see Israel one day giving up these 
settlements to exchange peace for land here, too? 
  [Katz] I believe we can convince the settlers that it is 
worthwhile to leave this area and move behind the green line in 
order to create a good atmosphere. I think we can convince them 
by starting a new Zionist movement. I think we can convince 
them to leave those areas. I hope we will achieve this by 
convincing them and not by forcing them. I am sure we can 
overcome this problem. I do not think the settlements will 
remain where they are now, at least not all of them. Maybe 
there are some strategic points, such as the Jordan Valley, 
where the settlers can remain and should remain. Yet, settlers 
who live near Arab municipalities with Palestinian inhabitants 
should leave these areas and move behind the green line. I hope 
they will move to Galilee and the Negev, thus strengthening the 
State of Israel. 
  [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, a lot will depend on whether the PLO 
manages to get the security situation on the Gaza Strip and in 
Jericho under control. What danger do you see, or how much 
rivalry from fundamentalist Hamas? 
  [Al-Tibi] You know, it is legitimate to have opposition, 
democratic opposition. There are Palestinians who do not 
support this agreement, although the great majority of 
Palestinian people support the peaceful settlements and the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, the Palestinian people also 
want to see tangible achievements. The most important factors 
for the success of this agreement are the development of the 
infrastructure, the creation of new jobs to eliminate high 
unemployment on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, and the 
financial support by the World Bank, the European Union, and the 
Arab world. I hope that part of the Islamic movement will 
participate in the government in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. 
They can even participate in the elections scheduled for next 
year. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Katz, the objective of the Palestinians is 
clear: a state of their own. Is that conceivable for Israel, 
and, as with the question of Jerusalem, when do you think that 
Israel will feel safe enough to grant the Palestinians this 
state next to Israel? 
  [Katz] I belong to a minority in my party. I believe that 
an independent Palestinian state would be something useful for 
Israel, for Israel's security. I think it is up to the 
Palestinians to take a decision on a safe future. I think that 
if we offer them the opportunity to create an independent 
Palestinian state, it will increase their sense of 
responsibility for what is going on there. 
  [Hochner] Mr. al-Tibi, the Palestinians have political 
expectations as well as political ones; certainly expectations 
for an independent state and not just the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area. When do you think the PLO will get this 
independent state, by what time does it want to have it? 
  [Al-Tibi] Under the agreement, the final solution regarding 
the status should be discussed at the beginning of the third 
year at the latest. However, we hope that official talks on the 
final status will begin as soon as possible. I think that the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement will naturally lead to an independent 
Palestinian state according to the developments in the area. 
First, because the Palestinians are seeking self-determination 
and an independent state. Second, I think that even in the 
Israeli cabinet, a majority of ministers supports the idea of an 
independent Palestinian state. I think that the whole thing 
might take place before the conclusion of the fifth year of the 
interim stage. 
  [Hochner] Thank you very much, Mr. Katz and Mr. al-Tibi.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yosi Katz, Israeli Labor Party Deputy, by </F>
Erhard Stackl in Vienna; date not given: "Palestinian State 
Possible Only Without Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Unofficial talks were held at the weekend between 
Israelis and Palestinians at the Vienna Kreisky Forum. DER 
STANDARD's Erhard Stackl talked to the organizer of the meeting, 
Yossi Katz, the Israeli Labor Party's deputy parliamentary group 
chairman. 
  [Stackl] You have negotiated with the PLO in Bruno Kreisky's 
house, whose demand for a dialogue with the Palestinians used to 
be criticized very sharply by the Israeli Labor Party. Is this 
a political rehabilitation for Kreisky? 
  [Katz] The answer might be yes in political terms. Yet, I 
am one of the people who have advocated contacts with the PLO 
for a long time. But a lot has changed, including the 
Palestinians. They have acknowledged Israel's right to 
existence, and Israel has accepted that the PLO represents the 
Palestinian people. 
  [Stackl] Are you in favor of an independent Palestinian 
state? 
  [Katz] It would be better for Israel, if the Palestinians 
had such a perspective. It would be in their own interests then 
to preserve peace and prevent terrorism. 
  [Stackl] Prime Minister Rabin is against it. 
  [Katz] But 74 percent of all Israelis think that there will 
be a Palestinian state -- without necessarily wanting it. 
  [Stackl] What is to become of the Jewish settlers? 
  [Katz] The settlements that are next to Palestinian 
residential areas are a problem. But at least 70 percent of the 
settlers are not fanatics; they only went to those territories 
to improve their personal circumstances. They are prepared to 
go back behind the Green Line (the pre-1967 border), if they are 
given land or an apartment here as an alternative. I have 
drafted a bill that is to offer such compensation to returning 
settlers. 
  I have also discussed this proposal with settlers. A few 
lunatics called my wife and told her that she will be a widow 
soon. But I think that settlers with ideological motives can 
also be convinced and a new Zionist movement can be established 
to promote settlements in the north and south of Israel. 
  [Stackl] What are the greatest dangers to the peace process? 
  [Katz] There are many obstacles, such as terrorism. But I 
think that the Palestinian police force will be able to cope 
with this danger together with the Israeli security forces. I 
can imagine more than half of (the extreme Islamistic movement) 
Hamas taking part in political life. But there may also be a 
civil war among the Palestinians -- this will be a test for 
them. Only if they prevent terrorism will they stand a chance 
of having a state. The bad economic situation is also a problem. 
  But there are also obstacles on our side. That is why we 
have talked about a permanent solution here. No one sent us to 
Vienna, but we will report to the prime minister and the foreign 
minister. 
  [Stackl] Are there not big differences on the issue of 
Palestinian refugees returning to Israel? 
  [Katz] The gap is not all that wide. The Palestinian 
refugees want their rights to be acknowledged and they want to 
get compensation. But they know that it will be impossible for 
them to return to Haifa or Jaffa. 
  [Stackl] Is Israel prepared to give up the Golan? 
  [Katz] The Golan Heights are important -- in times of war. 
But in times of peace, and when there are comprehensive 
economic, but also political relations with Syria, they are not 
needed. 
  [Stackl] Do you think there is a willingness to talk in 
Damascus? 
  [Katz] Yes, I think so. Some of my colleagues who have 
visited Syria recently say that al-Asad has also changed. There 
is a chance.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 16 May (MENA) -- MENA has learned that the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations scheduled to be held in Cairo 
tomorrow, Tuesday, have been postponed until after the 'Id 
al-Adha holiday. 
  Diplomatic sources in Cairo said the talks were postponed 
because of the Muslims' celebration of 'Id al-Adha next week, 
which precludes continuing the talks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Michael Anders] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, May 13 (AFP) -- Islamic nations stand ready 
to provide peacekeeping troops to defend the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina if Western UN forces are withdrawn, Pakistani 
Ambassador Hamad Kamal said Friday [13 May]. 
  Kamal was speaking after representatives of the 51-state 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] met in urgent 
session in Geneva and expressed "deep concerns" at the state of 
peace negotiations for Bosnia. 
  The Islamic gathering came as West European, U.S. and 
Russian 
foreign ministers also met in the city in a fresh effort to 
agree a workable peace, amid threats to withdraw UN forces if no 
formula is found rapidly. 
  Kamal read an OIC statement noting "the threat of certain 
countries to withdraw their peacekeeping contingents." France 
which has the biggest contingent has threatened withdrawal 
failing a rapid solution. 
  The OIC statement warned against such action without 
analysis 
of its impact on the situation on the ground and the drafting in 
of replacement troops, "for which adequate offers already exist 
from several OIC member states." 
  The Pakistani ambassador added that said while the OIC 
considered the lives of UN troops in Bosnia important, "we 
believe that the lives of the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
even more important." 
  Kamal also said a Malaysian major killed in Bosnia Thursday 
had died "in defence of the principles the OIC upholds in 
Bosnia." 
  Paying tribute to the same officer, Bosnian Ambassador 
Mohamed Sacirbegovic distinguished between countries which 
provided UN troops "mandated to defend civilians under attack" 
and those which "mandated soldiers to remain neutral." 
  Sacirbey interpreted Thursday's U.S. Senate vote calling for 
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia as a sign of concern at 
the "failure to provide balance to the military situation" and 
as a result influence the negotiations. 
  "The Bosnians do not just have friends in the Islamic world. 
They have friends in the highest institutions that represent 
democracy in the U.S. and the world in general," he told the OIC 
press conference. 
  In its statement the OIC, which has called for the lifting 
of 
the embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia, "regretted the exclusion 
of OIC representatives" from the so-called "contact group" 
meeting on Bosnia in Geneva. 
  The statement reaffirmed that OIC representatives should 
participate on an equal footing with those of other countries in 
the peace efforts. 
  While maintaining their offer of active participation, it 
said that "continued rejection of this offer could adversely 
impact upon the credibility and sustainability of any solutions 
worked out in their absence." 
  The OIC statement warned that a durable and just peace could 
not be achieved without ensuring the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the return of territories 
seized through aggression, ethnic cleansing or genocide.

  [Excerpts] It is emerging one week later that 'Arafat has 
made an appeal for the jihad to continue until Jerusalem is 
liberated. This took place in Johannesburg, at the time of 
Mandela's swearing-in ceremony, behind closed doors in a mosque. 
The Palestinian leader -- in English -- asked South Africa's 
Muslim community to participate in the jihad -- the holy war -- 
to liberate the city. 'Arafat has given assurances that the 
struggle will continue. More details from Tiago Rebelo: 
  [Rebelo] The Palestinian leader delivered the speech at a 
mosque -- with no journalists present -- but a recording of his 
words reached the South African Jewish community and the Israeli 
radio: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording] The jihad will continue. And 
Jerusalem is not for the Palestinian people [as heard]. [end 
recording] 
  [Rebelo] That is 'Arafat saying that the jihad will 
continue, 
because Jerusalem belongs to all Muslims and is more important 
than anything else the Palestinians have already got out of the 
Israelis. It was a public appeal by 'Arafat that, had it been 
made before the signing of the Cairo accords, could have been a 
reason for the Palestinian autonomy process to be stopped. The 
PLO leader is now making this appeal for Arab mobilization, 
because, as he stated, the main Palestinian battle concerns 
precisely Jerusalem, the most important Muslim holy place. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] We have the PLO representative live on the 
telephone. Good afternoon Dr. Isam Bisusu. We have now heard 
for the first time -- at least in Portugal -- 'Arafat's appeal. 
Is this a PLO counterattack? 
  [Bisusu] First, I want to confirm that President 'Arafat's 
political line, as well as that of the PLO in general, is 
precisely the one that was reported in the Declaration of 
Principles in Washington and signed in Cairo on 4 May. 
Therefore, I want to confirm again that 'Arafat, during the 
years of war against Israel, never made an appeal for a jihad; 
he never appealed for a jihad. This is because the PLO 
declaration, the PLO principles, are very clear about the 
international solidarity under which all Muslims, Jewish people, 
and Christians have a claim over Jerusalem. 
  [Announcer] Does that mean that jihad does not mean holy 
war? 
  [Bisusu] Holy war is a totally different thing that appeals 
to all Muslims all over the world to fight against the 
Christians and the Jews and is a totally different thing. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] We also have live on the telephone the Israeli 
Ambassador in Lisbon Binyamin Oron. Good afternoon. What is 
your reaction to 'Arafat's statement? 
  [Oron] Good afternoon. I would like to correct a small 
detail mentioned in your conversation: Jerusalem is not the main 
Muslim holy city, it is the third most holy city following Mecca 
and Medina. 
  [Announcer] Is it not the main holy city in Israel? 
  [Oron] It may be so, but it may be so for the Jews and not 
for the Muslims. That is a correction I wanted to make before I 
can add anything else. 
  [Announcer] Can you then comment on 'Arafat's appeal? 
  [Oron] Well, I heard the speech by the PLO president, Mr. 
'Arafat. I have not heard it completely, I only heard the bit 
you have broadcasted. If in reality those things were stated, I 
believe it is a serious statement. 
  [Announcer] Do you believe it is a threat to the climate of 
negotiations? 
  [Oron] Well, I believe that all the process is based on a 
mutual compromise, in the exchange of documents that preceeded 
the signing of the statement of principles which stated all the 
differences and conflicts would be decided or discussed through 
negotiations and in a peaceful manner. 
  [Announcer] Let me clarify a concept: Is jihad for you not a 
holy war different from the way Dr. Bisusu has interpreted it? 
  [Oron] I believe that people from the east have different 
interpretations. I do not want to debate academic 
interpretations. It is natural that the connotation of jihad is 
a negative one; it is not one of negotiation and compromise. It 
has a negative connotation although orientalists interpret it in 
different ways. 
  [Announcer] To end our conversation, could you tell us 
briefly about the statement made in Israel by the government? 
  [Oron] Well, the government, the prime minister, stated that 
if in reality those statements were made, there would be a 
question mark over the process. They are serious statements, 
and we would have to read the whole text to have a more official 
reaction. 
  [Announcer] Many thanks ambassador. Let us go back to Dr. 
Bisusu to have a final comment on the words of the Israeli 
ambassador in Lisbon: 
  [Bisusu] I believe that both sides, the Palestinians and 
Israelis, have made declarations of principles in Washington and 
Cairo. I believe the Palestinians and Israelis have an interest 
in following what was signed in those countries -- Egypt and the 
United States. As far as we are concerned, the war is over. 
The most important route is that of peace, and we are going to 
continue following this route. The Isreali occupation is over 
in part of Palestine -- Jericho and Gaza -- and this occupation 
ended with peace negotiations and not with military action. 
Therefore we must continue the peace negotiations that have 
been carried over the past seven months. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, member of </F>
the National Authority, by Itay Engel; place not given -- live, 
in English] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Engel] Dr. al-Agha, can we 
ask you to relate to the statement of Chairman 'Arafat in 
Johannesburg? The person who is in charge of the Palestinian 
side in this peace agreement talks about the need for the 
continuation of the jihad against the State of Israel. 
  [Al-Agha] I think when we started this peace process, we 
started the negotiations. Indeed, I am astonished about what is 
said in the broadcast about this, and indeed I didn't hear this 
statement. I have no official thought about this, so I would 
have to ask my chairman to understand what happened about this. 
  [Engel] I see. And if he says to you that indeed, he said 
and talked about the idea of the jihad, so you are going to 
implement now the idea of jihad, or you are going to continue 
with the peace process? 
  [Al-Agha] No, no, maybe the head means not only the armed 
struggle, but also any other means, like negotiations, like 
other. I don't think -- I am sure that Mr. 'Arafat doesn't mean 
what happened.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, Palestinian negotiator in </F>
the peace talks, by Brigitte Voykowitsch; place and date not 
given: "`Jerusalem is a Time Bomb, Because the Israelis Are 
Lacking in Sensitivity'"] 
  [Text] [Voykowitsch] Even moderate Palestinians are 
skeptical about the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Is the treaty that 
bad? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] The texts of the treaty themselves are not bad. 
There are too many restrictions of Palestinian authority. But 
those supporting the agreement have stressed that this is the 
first time that representatives of the Zionist ideology have 
accepted a withdrawal. Palestinians have always considered 
Zionist ideology as being expansionist. And this is the first 
time that Palestinians have part of the authority. 
  [Voykowitsch] What danger comes from the opponents of the 
agreement, the radicals, such as Hamas, and the groups in 
Damascus? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] A number of unfair conditions have been imposed 
on the Palestinians in the peace process, starting with 
regulations determining which Palestinians shall be allowed to 
negotiate. This has resulted in many Palestinians feeling that 
the process as such is unfair, and thus any outcome is unfair. 
  These critics will have a control function in the process. 
They will make sure that the negotiators do not make too many 
concessions and keep the interests and requirements of their 
people in mind. 
  [Voykowitsch] Does this mean that even the role of the Hamas 
and the radical Palestinian groups in Damascus is a constructive 
one? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] These groups are not opposed to peace, they 
have a supervisory role. They will not seek confrontation with 
the Palestinian police or the self-rule authorities. 
  [Voykowitsch] The refugee problem is still unsolved. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] We have to distinguish three groups of 
refugees: those of 1948, those of 1967, and those who left the 
territories with Israeli permission and were not allowed to 
return. The latter two -- that is nearly 800,000 people -- must 
be allowed to return immediately. Israel has no excuse for 
preventing this. 
  The refugees of 1948 (who left regions that are Israeli 
territory today) have a basic right to return. We do, however, 
understand that Israel wants to remain a Jewish state and will, 
therefore, not allow these refugees to come back as this would 
mean losing the Jewish majority. We must base our negotiations 
on UN Resolution 194, which speaks of return or compensation. 
  [Voykowitsch] Jerusalem is not on the official agenda before 
the second part of the peace process starts. But there are 
unofficial forums. What is the state of talks? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] The Israelis annexed East Jerusalem in 1967. 
But for years they have been establishing new Jewish 
neighborhoods there and have built settlement belts around the 
city. This means they are changing their status, although UN 
resolutions demand that the status quo be maintained. 
  The Israelis must be aware of this: No Palestinian, no Arab, 
no Islamic leader will conclude a comprehensive peace with 
Israel unless the Jerusalem question has been settled. 
  [Voykowitsch] How are talks proceeding at the moment? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] At the first meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin 
we brought up the East Jerusalem topic. On Rabin's suggestion a 
committee was formed, with each side delegating two 
representatives. I was one of them. But two months ago, the 
Israelis broke everything off. 
  This means that the old regulations that were introduced by 
the Israelis last year apply. Under these, every Arab wanting 
to got to East Jerusalem from the territories needs a kind of 
visa. This way they are killing off our institutions in the 
city. 
  Jerusalem is a time bomb, because the Israelis are lacking 
in 
sensitivity. They never think about the importance that the 
city has for Christians and Muslims. I can only hope that they 
will remember this in time. Otherwise there will be an 
explosion. For, whatever agreements we conclude, unless we can 
protect the rights of the Arabs in East Jerusalem, everything 
will collapse.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with Dr. Zakariya al-Agha and Lawyer </F>
Furayh Abu-Middayn, members of the Palestinian Self-Rule 
Authority, by Hasan Abu-Zayid "after the signing of an agreement 
on transferring the civil administration's powers to the 
Palestinian Self-Rule Authority" on 17 May; place not given; 
from the "With the Events" program; broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Al-Agha] ... according to the 
Cairo agreement, signed on 4 May 1994 between the PLO and the 
Israeli Government on transferring all powers and 
responsibilities from the Israeli authority to the Palestinian 
authority, and following continuous and comprehensive meetings 
held by the Civil Liaison Committee of the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides. During these meetings, the conferees discussed, 
scrutinized, and reviewed all issues pertaining to all civil 
departments. A few moments ago, a protocol on the handover of 
powers was officially signed by the two sides. From this moment 
on, the Palestinian authority will completely assume its powers 
in accordance with the Palestinian regulations and laws. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Zakariya al-Agha: When will the Palestinian 
authority begin its work? 
  [Al-Agha] This will take place once the formation of the 
Palestinian authority is finalized, and once the brothers from 
outside and inside the territories assume the tasks. I believe 
that, after 25 May, it will be possible for the Palestinian 
authority's council to begin work. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Until this takes place, and from now until 25 
May, who will run the affairs of residents in the territories? 
  [Al-Agha] The departments will continue their work. We, the 
representatives of the Palestinian authority; namely, myself, 
brother Furayh [Abu-Middayn], and brother Dr. Riyad [not further 
identified], will begin our missions and carry out this work 
until the Palestinian authority is finalized and until it 
assumes work. [end recording] 
  With regard to the issues which the Palestinian authority 
will address first, Lawyer Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the 
Palestinian Authority Council, says: 
  [Begin Abu-Middayn recording] The first priority will be 
given to the daily life of all residents. There are such 
problems as travel abroad as well as students' problems, which I 
believe were solved today with General Rothchild. Perhaps, the 
first step in this work would be to issue permits to West Bank 
university students. In fact, daily life will continue. We 
also give priority to organizational affairs [words indistinct] 
because this would be a basis for us. As you know, there were 
resignations from police ranks and there are no civil courts. 
This may be the first department in which we will begin orderly 
and intensive work. [end recording]

  [Text] Rafah, 17 May (MENA)--The Palestinian General 
Security Command issued its first declaration to the Palestinian 
people today, on the eve of the Palestinian police's assumption 
of their full powers in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. 
  The declaration specifies the duties of the Palestinian 
police as the maintenance of security and public order and 
ensuring peace and safety for all Palestinians within a 
framework of democracy, political pluralism, and the rule of law. 
  The declaration announces that schools and hospitals have 
been reopened and that various government institutions have 
begun to function. 
  The declaration calls on the Palestinian people to cooperate 
with the police to begin a new era and build a Palestinian state. 
  One hundred and seventy-six Palestinian police cars, sent by 
the United States to Port Said a few days ago, crossed at the 
Rafah border point today. 
  Meanwhile Israeli troops are preparing to evacuate all Gaza 
areas by tomorrow evening. Later today the Palestinians and 
Israelis will sign an official agreement transferring power to 
the Palestinian Authority as of Thursday [19 May]. The 
agreement specifies 38 different powers for the new Palestinian 
Authority. 
  An official of the Palestinian Authority confirmed that the 
Israeli Army will complete its withdrawal from Gaza on schedule 
and not one Israeli will remain inside the Palestinian autonomy 
areas by Thursday morning. 
  The Israeli Army placed Arabic, Hebrew, and English signs on 
major roads and areas saying: "Attention. You are entering the 
Palestinian Authority area. Entry must be coordinated with the 
Israeli Army." 
  The Palestinian Authority in Gaza has begun to establish a 
system for data processing and statistical programs. The 
venture is carried out by a Palestinian-Egyptian company based 
in Cairo. Engineer 'Ali Nabil Sha'th, the company's 
representative, said that the company has opened branches in 
Gaza and Jerusalem and that a number of Palestinian young people 
have been trained in the use of the data processing equipment, 
which has been reprogrammed to meet the needs of the Palestinian 
administration.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview With Faysal al-Husayni, member of the </F>
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho, by Kamal Tarabayh on 
17 May; place not given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Tarabayh] In Jericho, which is now under the 
Palestinian Authority, you have received U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. How do you evaluate the visit by a foreign 
minister of a superpower to the Palestinian autonomous area? 
  [Al-Husayni] In fact this visit has been allocated to the 
Palestinians within the agenda of the Syrian-Israeli track. 
Perhaps it is symbolic more than anything else. One meeting 
has already been held in Jericho and the other will be held 
tomorrow morning in East Jerusalem. 
  Concerning Jericho, it is obvious that the Americans want to 
be the first from outside the region to start official visits to 
Jericho. During the meeting, several questions were raised on 
the reality in which we are living after the Israeli withdrawal, 
in terms of needs and preparedness of the Palestinian forces. 
They informed us that certain assistance will be extended, 
either to the self-government in the future or to certain areas, 
such as Gaza in particular. 
  [Tarabayh] On the political level, what were the topics you 
discussed with Christopher? 
  [Al-Husayni] In fact the talks centered mainly on the issue 
of Jerusalem, the settlement activities, the Israeli practices. 
We also stressed the importance of starting negotiations on the 
final status [of the occupied territories] as soon as possible. 
  [Tarabayh] It was observed that when the self-rule agreement 
was signed in Cairo, you openly expressed your 
apprehensions--and this is not the first time--on the fate of 
Jerusalem. Do these apprehensions still exist? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes, we voiced apprehensions but we did not do 
anything and we did not take the appropriate measures. Perhaps 
we will lose Jerusalem. We must wage the battle for Jerusalem 
in order to present a new Palestinian fait accompli in the face 
of the Israeli fait accompli. The Israelis are trying to decide 
the issue of Jerusalem in their favor. 
  [Tarabayh] Does this mean that you consider that the 
self-rule agreement signed in Cairo ignored the issue of 
Jerusalem or failed to provide a solution for Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] We wished that the agreement had been preceded 
by an Israeli commitment to lifting the isolation of the city of 
Jerusalem. 
  [Tarabayh] In your opinion, why did the Palestinian side not 
insist on this issue? 
  [Al-Husayni] Let me say that at certain times the Israelis 
warned that there were certain demands which, if openly 
demanded, they could not meet, but if they were left to them, 
they might meet them in a calm manner. Perhaps there was a sort 
of understanding. I hope that it will happen in this way and 
Israel will lift the isolation of Jerusalem gradually and 
without great clamor in the media. However, up until now, we 
have not seen anything in this direction. 
  [Tarabayh] It was circulated that the name of Faysal 
al-Husayni was included in the list of members who would form 
the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] in Gaza and the Strip 
[as heard]. Will you participate in this authority? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. Despite all reservations, this agreement 
was signed, and became an accomplished fact. We should deal 
with this fact, not only in the sense of precisely working to 
implement its articles literally, but also in the sense of 
dealing with it in order to promote it and fill the gaps in the 
text. We believe that through continued and collective work we 
can circumvent these obstacles. 
  [Tarabayh] It was said that you insisted on having the 
portfolio of Jerusalem affairs. Is this true? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. My condition was that I would accept any 
post given to me provided it would not keep me away from 
Jerusalem in terms of time or geography. 
  [Tarabayh] When will the membership of the PNA be completed? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that a few days after the 'Id holiday 
[approximately 21-24 May], the picture would be clear. 
  [Tarabayh] Will this authority be regarded as a government? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes, it is a government. 
  [Tarabayh] In other words, can we address you by: Mr. 
Minister? 
  [Al-Husayni, laughing] This is premature. 
  [Tarabayh] How do you assess the current situation in the 
occupied Arab territories, particularly in light of the renewed 
clashes in Nabulus, Hebron, and other areas? 
  [Al-Husayni] The fact is that the Israelis began a partial 
withdrawal from specific areas in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli 
Army, however, has not withdrawn from other areas, and the 
settlements have not been removed. Consequently, occupation has 
not ended. Thus, in the presence of occupation, such clashes 
and events will continue until the Israelis behave otherwise and 
until they actually show, as part of a very clear plan, that 
they really wish to withdraw completely from the occupied 
Palestinian territories and remove their settlements. 
  [Tarabayh] Are you reassured about the deployment of the 
Palestinian police in the self-rule area and about the citizens' 
welcome of this police force? 
  [Al-Husayni] The citizens' welcome has exceeded imagination, 
and, perhaps, went beyond the conceivable limit. The backing, 
love, support, and rallying around the Palestinian national 
security forces may even impede the work of these forces. 
However, this rejoicing may last for a few days, but, 
ultimately, matters should be organized, and this love should 
facilitate not only the policemen's needs, as is the case now, 
but also their field work on the street. 
  [Tarabayh] How do you view the future coexistence between 
the Palestinian factions opposed to the self-rule agreement and 
the Palestinian factions represented in the national authority? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that if we follow a democratic 
approach as well as the freedom of opinion and the rational 
dealing with matters, and if we also refrain from using physical 
or verbal violence, we can achieve much. We need this 
opposition. An opposition is important in any country. There 
is opposition in Israel, and it affects the government in 
certain domains. Thus, why should we not have similar 
opposition? 
  [Tarabayh] Are there contacts designed to coordinate 
positions among these factions on the ground in the territories? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes, there are contacts. However, these 
contacts vary from one group to another. 
  [Tarabayh] Thank you, Faysal al-Husayni. 
  [Al-Husayni] You are welcome. Thank you.

  [Text] Tunis--Informed Palestinian sources say that the 
Fatah Revolutionary Council led by Yasir 'Arafat yesterday heard 
a report by Faruq Qaddumi, the Fatah secretary general, in which 
he attacked the recent Cairo agreement between Israel and the 
PLO. The sources say that Qaddumi's attack was particularly 
directed at 'Arafat's agreement to concede the right of 
representation for the national authority abroad. The sources 
said that a number of the Fatah Movement's Central Committee 
members are unwilling to leave for Jericho and assume their 
duties within the so-called national authority. The source said 
that Faruq Qaddumi, Hani al-Hasan, Khalid al-Hasan, Muhammad 
Jihad, and Muhammad Ghunaym have refused to go to Jericho, 
especially since there are differences on coordinating work 
between the Fatah commands at home and abroad.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gaza Mayor Dr. Zakariya Makki by Shadiyah </F>
Riyad; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Dr. Makki, with the departure of the last 
Israeli soldier from the self-rule areas in Gaza, what changes 
have taken place since the signing of the agreement and what 
changes do you expect to occur in the next few days? 
  [Makki] The departure of the Israeli occupation from Gaza 
or, 
to be more precise, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from 
densely populated areas ended a nightmare for the Palestinian 
people and spread rapture among Palestinians everywhere. A step 
has been taken toward building a foundation on which our 
Palestinian people may stand until they move toward establishing 
their free Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  The situation in the West Bank and Gaza is one of great 
jubilation. Most people were thrilled by the departure of the 
Israeli troops, who used to kill children, women, and youths and 
throw them in prison. Now Palestinian flags flutter over every 
house and children rejoice. But there is sadness for those 
heroic martyrs who fell during the eight years of the intifadah. 
We say to them: You died to give us a new lease of life. It 
is a new beginning and we hope it will be auspicious, God 
willing. 
  [Riyad] We certainly hope so. The self-rule authority in 
Gaza and Jericho has considerable responsibility. Would you 
like to tell us about the situation in Gaza concerning the 
economy, education, and the infrastructure? 
  [Makki] For 27 years, Israel has been trying to link the 
occupied territories with Israel in the hope of integrating 
these areas into the Israeli territories. This policy left 
quite a scar on the infrastructure and the economy of Gaza and 
the West Bank. We need to rebuild the infrastructure in Gaza 
from scratch. This applies to electricity, water, sewage, and 
all public services. The Israelis left us with another serious 
problem. Over 70,000 Palestinians are jobless. The economy in 
the occupied territories is very bad and we need to think of a 
way to improve it. 
  [Riyad] During the signing ceremony of the Gaza-Jericho 
accord, President Mubarak called for political and financial 
support to promote the step. What is required now from all the 
parties concerned with this accord--the Arab states, European 
states, the cosponsors of the conference, and the United Nations? 
  [Makki] President Mubarak and the Egyptian people have 
always 
strongly supported the Palestinian people. We say that it is 
the duty of the brothers everywhere, be they Egyptians or 
Palestinians, to cooperate with each other. We focus on a very 
important thing, namely, that the states that support this peace 
must entrench it on the ground by strengthening the Palestinian 
economy. The European Union, the United States, the IMF, 
Russia, and the United Nations must support the Palestinian 
people, who need the prerequisites for establishing this 
authority on strong bases. Without a strong economy, the 
Palestinian people will face great problems. The Palestinian 
authority will face economic problems. It cannot solve these 
problems alone; it needs the help of the Arab countries. I 
appeal to all the Arab states and especially to all the Gulf 
states, the European states, and the United States to support 
the Palestinian people in their hardship and during this 
critical interim period. 
  [Riyad] What is the stance of the opponents of the self-rule 
accord in Gaza and Jericho and what is their reaction to the 
entry of the Palestinian police force to these two areas? 
  [Makki] The Palestinian people are very intelligent. The 
Palestinian opposition is a healthy and intelligent opposition. 
According to reliable information, they will receive the 
Palestinian police force with amity and appreciation. 
Palestinians might differ among each other ideologically but 
this does not conflict with the entry of the Palestinian force 
from among our sons, who will protect us and safeguard the 
property of the Palestinian people, individuals, and their 
lives. I believe that the opposition, in light of the 
statements it has issued, will not oppose; on the contrary, it 
will receive the Palestinian police force with an open heart. 
  [Riyad] Do you wish to address the Palestinian people on the 
birth of the first Palestinian entity? 
  [Makki] We tell our brothers the Palestinian people in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip that it is the duty of the Palestinians 
to unite in these difficult conditions and to support each other 
so that we can move from this step to build our independent 
Palestinian state. God willing, the capital of this state will 
be Jerusalem.

  [Text] Following the crime perpetrated by Zionist settlers 
in Hebron yesterday, an official spokesman for the Palestine 
National Liberation Movement, Fatah, [dissident] has stated that 
what happened in Hebron yesterday was definite proof exposing 
the falsehoods that have been going on for some time, concerning 
the agreements that Yasir 'Arafat concluded with the Zionist 
enemy. 
  The spokesman added that what happened in Hebron yesterday 
also confirmed the extent of both 'Arafat's involvement and his 
standing in the Zionist enemy's trench. He asserted that our 
militant people will continue their intifadah and daily struggle 
and will not pay attention to the falsehoods and deception 
pursued by the 'Arafatist group regarding its agreements with 
the enemy. The Zionist attacks and massacres will not go 
unpunished, he said.

<F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "Nazzal: Continuation of Israeli </F>
Occupation Means That Our Military Operations Against It Will 
Not Cease"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Muhammad Nazzal, representative of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Jordan, has stressed the 
movement's opposition to participation in the self-rule 
elections. He pointed out that Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has no "real desire" to "establish democracy through the 
election principle and guaranteeing the opposition's right to 
perform their activities freely." He stressed that the 
continuation of the military operations of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
Battalions, Hamas' military wing, "is linked to the presence of 
the occupation." 
  Nazzal told AL-HAYAH that the movement's position on the 
question of contesting the self-rule elections in October "is 
clear and declared. We are for legislative elections in which 
the people choose their leadership. As for the elections linked 
to the self-rule plan, our position is clear with regard to the 
refusal to participate in them." He accused those "calling for 
participation in the elections of marketing their political 
plans to justify their weak positions." He drew a distinction 
between administrative rule elections and "unionist, student, 
and municipal" elections. He said that "we are for 
participation in all these elections. The only exception is the 
administrative elections linked to the self-rule." 
  Nazzal said that "so far we have not sensed within the 
influential minority any real desire to establish democracy in 
Palestinian society through the election principle and 
guaranteeing the opposition's right to perform their activities 
freely." He added that "what we are witnessing in reality is 
exactly the opposite. The PLO leadership is against the 
election principle." 
  He added that "this leadership's commitment in its recent 
agreement with Israel to prevent verbal incitement by 
organizations or groups against the occupation authorities casts 
dark shadows on this leadership's method of dealing with its 
opponents in the stage ahead." 
  He was asked: Will you continue military action if you join 
the [Palestinian] authority? He replied: "That assumption is 
wrong. Who said we are going to participate in the authority? 
And what sort of authority is the one being talked about, whose 
composition is subject to the occupation authorities' approval?" 
Nazzal pointed out that "Hamas' continuation of the resistance 
is linked to the presence of the occupation. As long as the 
Israeli occupation continues to exist, the resistance against it 
will continue and never cease." He added that he accepts "the 
flexibility that does not deviate from the constants and that 
gives room for moving toward achieving the Palestinian aims.... 
If the intention is to say that Hamas is showing one thing and 
concealing another, and that its positions are aimed at 
achieving some interests, even if these interests conflict with 
its principles and constants, this concept does not apply to us 
and is unacceptable to us." 
  Hamas' representative in Amman went on to say that the 
"al-Qassam Battalions will not be abolished, nor will they cease 
to operate. Nor is there any reason to do that as long as the 
occupation is still weighing heavily on our land. In fact all 
international conventions and treaties guarantee us the right to 
resist as long as the causes prompting this resistance have not 
been eliminated." 
  Asked who is going to agree to support them financially if 
efforts to establish a comprehensive settlement continue, Nazzal 
said: "Despite our repeated affirmations that we have not 
received any money from any official quarter, it seems there is 
a determination to stir up this matter." He added: "I believe 
that those who raise these questions are comparing us with those 
on the Palestinian scene who received millions of dollars during 
the decades in which conditions were favorable for confronting 
the occupation, but they could not achieve what Hamas has now 
achieved. So it is difficult for some people to accept the fact 
that Hamas has achieved a lot with limited resources." 
  Nazzal stressed that "Hamas has not received any money from 
any official quarter so far." He added that "it does not mean 
that we consider such support for Palestinian action a crime 
that should be denied. We believe that bolstering the 
Palestinian people's steadfastness and resistance against the 
occupation is a pan-Arab and Islamic duty for all Arab and 
Islamic quarters, official and popular." He added that Hamas 
does not reject such an unconditional support. "But the facts 
should be stated as they stand in order to put matters straight." 
  Nazzal described Hamas' relations with the other nine 
factions of the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" opposed to the 
Oslo accord as "good. We are coordinating with them in order to 
consolidate and unite our efforts and tackle the challenges of 
this stage." He stressed that Hamas "is not accused by anyone. 
It declares its positions clearly and courageously. We offered 
our opinion clearly on a number of issues" during the alliance's 
meeting two weeks ago. It was "from the position of an ally 
seeking common denominators."

  [Text] Muhammad Nazzal, representative of the Hamas 
Movement in Jordan, has said the movement supports legislative 
elections, through which the Palestinian people would freely 
elect their leadership and representatives. In an exclusive 
interview with AKHIR KHABAR, Nazzal said Hamas reiterated its 
rejection of self-rule and the agreement which paved the road 
for it. He said: This stand does not contradict the movement's 
stand welcoming the return of the Palestinian police. He said: 
We consider the police to be part of our Palestinian people and 
call on them to safeguard the unity of the people, not to crush 
them or confiscate their freedom. He said: We will not clash 
with them. 
  Nazzal denied reports that Hamas has asked the PLO to 
mediate 
with Israeli authorities to release Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. He said 
this issue cannot be used as bargaining card to pressure the 
movement, saying Shaykh Yasin himself rejects this. He said: 
No contacts to this effect have been made with the PLO. 
  Muhammad Nazzal reiterated Hamas' rejection of recent 
developments, noting that the refusal of national figures 
respected by Palestinians to participate in the national 
authority shows the recent agreement has blatantly bypassed the 
rights of the Palestinian people.

  [Text] Damascus -- In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, 
Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, general secretary of the Islamic Jihad 
Movement, said that the Islamic Jihad Movement realizes that it 
is facing a changing and new reality, which calls for drawing up 
a dynamic and new program. He added: We will examine and 
reevaluate the new conditions with a view to formulating a more 
effective program. 
  Al-Shaqaqi noted that some of the details of this reality 
are 
still ambiguous. This will affect a decision on all these 
issues and will leave options and possibilities open. He 
criticized the recent Cairo agreement and affirmed his 
movement's refusal to recognize this agreement, which according 
to him gives the occupation legitimacy over a major part of 
Palestine in return for ridiculous self-rule over a small part 
of the homeland. 
  Al-Shaqaqi added: We have to continue mobilizing the people 
against the agreement and draw attention to its dangers, which 
are epitomized by the loss of Palestine; the annulment of the 
Palestinian people's presence; and Israel's decisive victory. 
Israel is entering the region as a recognized central and 
dominating power with a recognized role. 
  On the Islamic Jihad Movement's stance toward the 
Palestinian 
police, al-Shaqaqi stressed that one of his movement's 
priorities will be to avoid armed clashes with the Palestinian 
authority and police and that Islamic Jihad will do its utmost 
to avoid clashes even if it is forced to change its tactics in 
Gaza. He noted that one of Israel's major goals is to spark 
these clashes and preoccupy the Palestinians. 
  Al-Shaqaqi said that it was important to achieve a more 
effective political, social, and cultural presence in the coming 
stage while affirming the unity of and coordination among 
opposition Islamic and national forces. This, in a bid to reach 
the best practical program possible so as to move beyond just 
issuing statements while the effort on the ground remains 
divided and isolated. 
  In answer to a question about an issue currently 
preoccupying 
the Israelis, namely, whether he had any information about 
missing and captured Israelis, especially the pilot Ron Arad, 
al-Shaqaqi said that according to his information all missing 
Israelis, with the exception of Ron Arad, were dead. Those 
missing in 1982 were killed and there are conflicting reports 
about the whereabouts of their bodies. Two Israeli soldiers 
were captured by Hizballah fighters in 1986. One of them was 
killed on the spot and the other died from his wounds. As for 
Ron Arad, he was captured by the fighters of the "Faithful 
Resistance," which is a small splinter faction of the Amal 
Movement and holds Islamic tendencies. This faction was 
recently disbanded. 
  Al-Shaqaqi added that the Faithful Resistance leaders say 
that they did capture Ron Arad but that after a while he 
disappeared or fled and that most likely an unknown party is 
still holding him. In any case, this party must be protecting 
him and has important reasons for doing so.

  [Text] Three more members have been appointed to the 
Palestinian National Authority Council. This was announced in 
Tunisia yesterday. The Council will be in charge of the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho area following Israeli withdrawal. 
  An informed Palestinian source said the three members -- who 
were appointed during a PLO Executive Committee meeting held the 
day before yesterday under the chairmanship of President Yasir 
'Arafat -- are brothers Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, chief of the PLO 
Information Department; Sari Nusaybah, a teacher at the Bir Zayt 
University; and Munib al-Masri, a businessman in the West Bank 
city of Nabulus. 
  The Palestinian source said Nusaybah and al-Masri informed 
the PLO Executive Committee of their agreement on the 
appointment while 'Abd-Rabbuh asked a period of time to think 
the matter over before giving his final consent. 
  With the appointment of those members, six other members are 
still to be appointed to the Palestinian National Authority 
Council, which consists of 24 members and is chaired by leader 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]. Fifteen members of the council had 
already been appointed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Acceptors and Rejectors of </F>
Participation in the Palestinian Autonomous Authority"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A number of PLO 
Executive Committee members have refused to take part in the 
autonomous authority in Gaza and Jericho while others have 
agreed to do so. 
  According to one Executive Committee member, those who have 
so far refused are Faruq Qaddumi, Mahmud 'Abbas, Jawid 
al-Ghusayn, Jamal al-Surani, and Sulayman al-Najjab. Yasir 'Amr 
has agreed to participate but some others have not made up their 
minds yet. 
  According to the same member, those who have refused object 
basically to the substance of the agreement recently signed in 
Cairo and the way in which the negotiations with Israel were 
conducted. 
  The Palestinian official said that PLO Executive Committee 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat offered participation in the authority to 
all Executive Committee members without exception. All those 
contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT were willing to give their views 
as to why they refused to participate but they asked to remain 
anonymous, with the exception of PLO Executive Committee Member 
Sulayman al-Najjab who said: "Yes, as a PLO Executive Committee 
member, they offered me participation in the authority and they 
also made the same offer to the People's Party to which I 
belong. My position is the same as the party's position. It is 
neither new nor a surprise to anyone. We told 'Arafat as far 
back as Oslo that our participation in the authority should not 
be taken for granted because that would depend on the powers of 
the authority, which was the subject of negotiation at the time, 
and also on the authority's program for tackling the issues that 
would be referred to it such as education, health, and so on. 
We said at the time that if no agreement was reached on these 
powers and on such a program then we would not participate in 
the authority, and that is what happened." 
  Al-Najjab added: "This authority has no powers except in 
name. It is more like an executive body linked to the Israeli 
military government through coordination and liaison committees 
named in the Cairo agreement which covers all aspects of the 
activities and powers of that authority and gives the Israelis 
an absolute veto. That agreement cannot be developed from within 
as some people imagine. The agreement does not recognize any of 
the Palestinian people's rights, not even their minimum rights 
of controlling their occupied territory and their entitlement to 
that territory, as the Israelis object to it being described as 
occupied territory." 
  He also said: "Our main concern is how to defend the 
objective of national independence for the Palestinian people 
and the cause of the refugees in accordance with the UN 
resolutions. Without securing these two objectives, the 
Palestinian people will not stop their struggle and there will 
be no real stability in the region." 
  Another Executive Committee member, who wished to remain 
anonymous, said: "I support a political settlement based on 
Resolutions 242, 338 and the other UN resolutions on the refugee 
question. Despite my reservations regarding many flaws in the 
Oslo agreement, I accepted it as a mere agreement on principles 
that would be translated into detailed agreements open to 
modification through negotiations." 
  He added: "Regrettably, the Cairo agreement and all its 
supplements precipitated Palestinian acceptance of the Israeli 
security plan and concept and made it possible for the Israeli 
side to avoid any reference to Security Council Resolution 242 
or commitment to it. That is why I have refused to be a part of 
the authority that will implement that agreement." 
  He added: "Those who like to compare the Cairo agreement 
with the Balfour Declaration are actually insulting Palestinian 
intelligence. The Balfour Declaration gave the Jews a national 
homeland in Palestine. I ask: Where in the Cairo agreement is 
there any mention or mere reference to such a promise?" 
  He pointed out that he did not see in that agreement and its 
clear ceiling any room for independent action, and that is why 
it would not improve the current tragic situation our people in 
the occupied territory are suffering. 
  A third member told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "It is most 
regrettable that what was signed in Cairo was the Israeli draft 
submitted during the Taba talks as a way of sounding out the 
Palestinian side, with some superficial changes which some saw 
as achievements." 
  Wondering about these achievements, he asked: Is changing 
the number of the national authority members from 12, as in the 
Israeli draft, to 24, as requested by the Palestinian side, 
considered an achievement? 
  Is changing Palestinian territorial waters opposite Gaza 
from 
3 nautical miles, as in the Israeli draft, to 6 miles, as 
stipulated in the Cairo agreement, an achievement? 
  He added: The Israeli draft, which we had the right to 
reject or add substantial amendments to if we could not submit 
our own plan, was the draft that was signed as the Cairo 
agreement, with some superficial amendments.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Natasha Bukhari] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Nominees for the new Palestinian self-rule 
authority in Jericho and Gaza, though enthusiastic about the 
future are reluctant to assume the task, a PLO official said 
Monday [16 May]. 
  "It is a difficult responsibility that requires a lot of 
work 
in light of the uncertainty of the situation in the self-rule 
areas," said the official who asked not to be named. 
  He added that the reluctance of some nominees to accept 
offers by the PLO to assume positions of authority in Gaza and 
the West Bank town of Jericho was understandable as the task of 
members of the new Palestinian authority is "nothing to be 
envied for." 
  Asad 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was offered a position in the new 
Palestinian authority, told the JORDAN TIMES that he has not yet 
made up his mind on whether or not to accept the offer. 
  "There is a very thin line between the enthusiasm I feel 
about the offer and the political suicide I might be committing 
if I do accept," Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman, who currently heads the 
'Abd-al-Hamid Shoman Foundation said. 
  He said fear of political suicide stems from three 
"legitimate" reasons; the first was the "not-so-promising 
Israeli attitude." 
  "The Palestinian right to self determination does not seem 
to 
be a real concern for the Israelis and there are no guarantees 
that it will ever be," he explained. 
  The second reason for Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's reservations is 
his "lack of confidence in the ability of Western and 
international communities to convince Israel to ease the 
pressure off the Palestinians and help them accommodate their 
needs in the coming stage." 
  "Last but not least," he added, "I have my doubts about the 
Palestinians' competence in managing, organising and running the 
self-rule areas in a manner that would meet the expectations of 
people in the occupied territories." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman said that he realised that a decision on 
his part should be taken soon, but that before he makes any 
decision on the matter, he has to make "a clear cut evaluation 
of the whole situation." 
  Commenting on the reluctance of other Palestinians leaders 
to 
be part of the new Palestinian authority, Ibrahim Qub'ah, a 
member of the Palestine National Council (PNC), said that in 
many cases, personal interests rise above national ones. He 
said that it was every Palestinian's duty to participate in 
forming and serving the new authority. 
  "All competent politicians should help found the new 
authority, it is their duty towards their country," Mr. Qub'ah 
said. Asked whether he would accept such an offer, he said that 
there were more qualified politicians for the job than he was, 
but that he will be willing to accept a councilling position in 
the authority. 
  Mr. Qub'ah added that despite the refusal of very few people 
to assume leading positions in the future authority, there are 
unqualified Palestinians seeking high power positions. 
  "I would suggest the opening of training centres for our 
unqualified young men who will eventually take over." 
  He said that to ensure a solid base for competent authority, 
a scientific approach should be adopted. 
  "We can train and teach our people the science of management 
of utilities exactly like we trained the police forces," he 
added. 
  Salih Ra'fat, a member of the Palestinian Democratic Union 
(FIDA) said that some leading Palestinians had their political 
reasons for turning down the offer of participating in the new 
Palestinian self-rule authority. One such leader, according to 
Mr. Ra'fat, is Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who led the Palestinian 
delegation to the Madrid and Washington talks with Israel. 
  "He (Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi) disagrees with Yasir 'Arafat's 
ruling 
methods," Mr. Ra'fat said. 
  FIDA has opposed the self-rule agreement signed in Cairo on 
May 4 called on the Palestinian people to strive to eliminate 
the "restrictions imposed on them by the agreement," Mr. Ra'fat 
said. 
  He added that being part of the new Palestinian authority 
was 
one medium to do so and that they (FIDA) would like to see more 
of their members nominated for leading positions in the new 
authority. 
  Two FIDA officials, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Azmi Shu'aybi, 
have 
been nominated for the new authority," but we are working on 
including at least one more FIDA official," Mr. Ra'fat said. 
  He said that he "respected" Hanan 'Ashrawi's decision to 
decline the appointment in the new authority in order to devote 
herself and her efforts to the Independent Palestinian 
Commission for Human Rights, to which she was recently elected 
as commissioner. 
  "It is only natural for Ms. 'Ashrawi to refuse the offer, 
for 
she has chosen the duty of monitoring the performance of the new 
authority," said Mr. Ra'fat.

  [Text] Tunis, 16 May (MENA) -- 'Abbas Zaki, Fatah Central 
Committee member, stated that the committee met with PLO Fatah 
leader and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat last night. The committee 
discussed completing the formation of the Palestinian National 
Authority Council and building the authority's institutions in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  In a statement to MENA in Tunis, Zaki said the committee 
also 
discussed Fatah's future strategy, because Fatah's role has not 
yet ended and because it is responsible for transforming the new 
Palestinian entity in Gaza and Jericho into a Palestinian state. 
  In his statement, the Palestinian official said that the 
committee assessed Fatah's future political and practical 
policies and the transfer of 1,200 PLO cadres from Tunis to Gaza 
and Jericho during the next stage. 
  Reacting to reports about his appointment as the Palestine 
ambassador to Oman, Zaki said that as a member of the Fatah 
Movement he is committed to the instructions of the Fatah 
leadership, whether inside or outside the territories.

in charge of internal security in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip on behalf of the PLO, will arrive in the autonomous area 
on Tuesday [17 May]. Jibril al-Rujub told our correspondent 
Karmela Menashe he will arrive to the Allenby Bridge with 
several of his aides Tuesday morning, from where he will 
continue to Hebron. Al-Rujub expressed satisfaction with the 
rate of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the autonomy 
areas. He said it feels very good to return after six years and 
five months in the diaspora, and 17 years in prison. Al-Rujub 
says the two nations have no alternative to coexistence. He 
defined this a national and religious duty.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 16 (AFP) -- 
Palestinian police stepped in to save a leading PLO militant 
from being captured by the Israeli army, a senior PLO official 
said Monday [16 May]. 
  The police intervened late Sunday as Fatah Hawks leader 
Ziyad 
Gharman and nine other activists armed with M16, Uzi, and 
Kalashnikov machine guns, fled an Israeli patrol lying in wait 
on a road between Gaza City and Nusayrat, the official told AFP. 
  The PLO men took refuge in a farmhouse which was surrounded 
by troops. 
  Palestinian police were informed and after intensive talks 
the army agreed to let the men go. 
  The militants were taken to the police headquarters in Gaza 
where a senior Palestinian officer advised them "to stay in 
hiding and not to move" as long as the Israeli army was present 
on the Gaza Strip. 
  The Palestinian police last Wednesday started to take over 
the strip, in line with the May 4 PLO-Israel agreement on 
limited self-rule. 
  "We don't want to lose you in the final moments of the 
occupation," the officer told the Hawks. 
  The Israeli army spokesman said he was unaware of the 
incident.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Leading Figures Deny </F>
Knowledge of the Incident, But Jordanian Sources Say an Attempt 
To Blow Up 'Arafat's Plane Was Foiled"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Leading Palestinian 
figures in Amman yesterday denied knowledge of an attempt to 
assassinate Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat during his 
recent visit to the Jardanian capital after signing the Cairo 
agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Jordanian sources had stated that the attempt was discovered 
hours before the arrival of 'Arafat's plane. Primitive missiles 
were placed near the runways of the military airfield (special 
section) in the "Marka" area in the Jordanian capital. That 
prompted the security authorities to change the landing area for 
'Arafat's plane and the plane was diverted to the deserted 
civilian airport in the same area. 
  The sources added that stringent security measures were 
taken 
upon 'Arafat's arrival and during his reception. Reporters were 
not allowed in the reception hall even though they had been 
invited to participate in the reception for the Palestinian 
president. Those who were there to receive him, including PLO 
leaders, were physically thoroughly searched and their cars were 
carefully searched. They included [Fatah] Central Committee 
Member 'Abbas Zaki. For the first time, their cars were not 
allowed in the reception area of the airport. 
  Meanwhile, Palestinian Embassy sources in Amman have denied 
media reports of an attempt to assassinate 'Arafat in 
Johannesburg while he was attending President Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration last week.

  [Text] Brothers: Welcome to Palestine, for which we have 
struggled all this time. Welcome to all the Palestinian hands 
that are rushing to build a beautiful, free, and auspicious 
homeland. These are glorious days, with the arrival of the 
vanguards of the Palestinian police force, the Palestinian 
administrations, and the groups of Palestinian deportees. As 
Palestinians, we must move toward hope instead of sorrow, toward 
work instead of self- flagellation, and away from the edge of 
illusion. 
  We are addressing those who support and those who oppose the 
agreement. Why? Because what is appearing before us now is the 
Palestinian homeland. Who dares to reject the homeland? Who 
dares to escape from life into deplorable exile? Despite its 
advantages and disadvantages, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement 
has moved from paper articles into real national interaction on 
the ground. It has moved from endless pages of opinions -- some 
of which are right and some of which are wrong -- into a land 
where a homeland is being established. This homeland needs 
economic and administrative skills. It needs intensive efforts 
to extend housing, water, education, health, judiciary, customs 
services, and thousands of other details. This includes the 
upcoming elections in the homeland, which will baptize our 
democratic solidarity and our political life, based on pluralism 
and respect for human rights. 
  As Palestinians, we must leave the waiting room and get 
involved in work, collective effort, and comprehensive 
participation. We must leave behind the sands of exile and the 
language of skepticism, loss, fear, and hesitation. We must use 
the dictionary of national presence. 
  We all know the language of accusations and counter 
accusations was never our language. It was, instead, a 
barbaric language imposed on us by the authority of the 
diaspora, the dictatorship of geography and by coercive 
alliances we could not escape. One party or another wanted us 
to say (?no) in order to serve its personal interests and its 
special strategy. For some of the factions, forces, and trends, 
this word no was the only password. 
  The homeland is being born again. It is rising before us. 
The license for entry to the homeland is the word yes: Yes to 
building, yes to participation, yes to positive contribution. 
This is everyone's responsibility. 
  O brothers, many tasks are before us. Our burden is large. 
We must work hard, in keeping with our ambitions. Just as we 
built for others, it is now time for us to build for ourselves. 
Is there anything more sacred than having a homeland that we 
can build and a future for our children which we can maintain 
away from the pressures and haggling of others? 
  Welcome to Palestine, which is returning to life, 
transformed 
from absence into reality, from idea into the revolution, and 
into the state. Welcome to Palestine -- the homeland, the 
state, and the entity. Welcome to Palestine, the call of the 
memory that never fades and the result of our effort that is not 
in vain. Everything we do for it is for us. Every tree we 
plant shelters us. Every house, every factory and farm, every 
school, university, hospital, and laboratory we build will 
testify to our everlasting presence. 
  At the places of exile, everything was claimed by others. 
Welcome to Palestine. Welcome to all the hands that are united 
together to build this great edifice.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Husni Mubarak by Olaf Ihlau and </F>
Volkhard Windfuhr in Cairo; date not given: "We Are Living in a 
New Era"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, it must be a 
frustrating job to act as the peace mediator in the Middle East. 
  [Mubarak] To mediate for peace means to prevent bloodshed 
and to contribute to raising the living standard of the peoples. 
This is particularly difficult if the relations between an 
occupied people and its occupiers are at issue -- the 
Palestinian problem, which has been waiting for a solution for 
47 years. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The peace mediator is in danger of suffering 
Sisyphus' fate. 
  [Mubarak] To live means to hope. If the sincere will to 
peace exists and the partners in the negotiations really make 
efforts, there must be a positive result. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For decades, there has been a state of war 
between Arabs and Israelis. Is better insight supposed to get 
the upper hand overnight? 
  [Mubarak] Israel has lived in an atmosphere of war and 
unrest for a long time. I cannot imagine that the Israelis 
would be prepared to continue to carry such a burden. Today the 
whole world has realized that problems cannot be solved by war. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Here you are hardly speaking for all Arab 
leaders. 
  [Mubarak] Those who are still talking about war today are 
impostors. Even Israel is building on negotiations and sits 
down at the negotiating table together with Palestinians, 
Syrians, and Jordanians. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And the results of the negotiations are 
disputed up to the very last minute, as was demonstrated during 
the spoiled ceremony in Cairo when PLO Chairman 'Arafat did not 
want to initial the maps of the autonomous region of Jericho. 
This must have rather bugged you as the patron and mediator? 
  [Mubarak] One has to expect such things. A trifle can cause 
such an incident. Although the persons present looked 
concerned, I was sure that we would overcome the difficulty 
because the previous evening we had agreed on the points that 
caused confusion in the congress center. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What caused the whole turmoil? What went 
wrong? 
  [Mubarak] It was the old story: The Palestinians do not 
trust the Israelis and the Israelis have their doubts about the 
Palestinians' sincerity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What was the matter with the maps that 'Arafat 
did not accept? 
  [Mubarak] The maps were the last topic with which we dealt 
the night before the signing of the agreement. Referring to 
security problems, the Israelis did not want to grant the 
Palestinians the area for Jericho that they demanded. And in 
the autonomous region of Gaza a 47-km long coastal strip was at 
issue. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, there was no agreement on 
these questions? 
  [Mubarak] Yes, a compromise was found. The Palestinians got 
a large coastal strip and the Israelis several kilometers of 
water for their security zone. But the main point was the 
agreement that the detailed negotiations on the area of the 
autonomous territories in Gaza and Jericho would be continued 
after the signing of the accord. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, 'Arafat's appearance was more 
of a theatrical coup for the Palestinians' use? 
  [Mubarak] The Palestinians did not have any confidence. 
They believed that the putting off of the matter until further 
negotiations was only "Sahlaa," eyewash, particularly since no 
such thing had indeed been recorded in the documents. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And how did you team the two sides up again 
behind the scenes? 
  [Mubarak] Well, it took me only two minutes. I reminded 
Rabin and Peres of the nightly agreements. We decided that 
Israel would draft a letter that would be signed by Americans 
and Russians, the two cosponsors of the agreement, and confirm 
that further negotiations would be held on the area of Jericho 
and Gaza -- after the agreement. Thus, the problem was 
solved.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ... and your mediation mission was also 
solved. 
  [Mubarak] The negotiations that lasted for half a night were 
indeed strenuous. When the coastal waters of Gaza were 
discussed, 'Arafat shouted all the time "This is my sea." This 
really made me laugh. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin was probably right when he claimed that 
now the world is only perceiving "the tip of the iceberg of the 
problems" that the Palestinians and Israelis have to overcome. 
  [Mubarak] This is largely true. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why is 'Arafat now taking his time in the 
implementation of the autonomy agreement? 
  [Mubarak] What is in store for 'Arafat is tremendous. For 
46 years, it was not granted to the Palestinians to take over 
government tasks. Now they suddenly have to deal with such 
unfamiliar things as agriculture, infrastructure, services, food 
supply, and civil servants' salaries. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But the PLO really had enough time to prepare 
itself for it. 
  [Mubarak] I advised the Palestinians at an early stage to 
develop a plan on an administrative structure. But they would 
have come into difficulties anyway. Egypt and the other 
countries of the region must help the Palestinians to cope with 
their initial difficulties. If we hesitate here, there will be 
a setback. I would rather not imagine the consequences. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps widely travelled guerrilla leader 
Yasir 'Arafat finds it hard to put up with the role of a better 
sort of provincial governor who mainly has to deal with housing 
and sewage problems. 
  [Mubarak] The abrupt change from the PLO chairman to the 
head of government at home in Palestine is more difficult than 
to wage a war. Such a process takes time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And 'Arafat also has to overcome the 
resistance of those Palestinians who think that he is Israel's 
Quisling. 
  [Mubarak] I want to tell you one thing: When President 
al-Sadat signed the Camp David peace agreement with Israel for 
Egypt in 1978, all Palestinians, including 'Arafat, called him a 
"traitor." By Allah, this was a terrible campaign, almost a war. 
  And what was the result? Now they call him a hero and 
lament: "If we had only listened to al-Sadat." A late insight. 
At that time, the Palestinians were only dealing with 48 
smaller Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, today 
there are 180. 
  'Arafat showed courage. His decision to go to the occupied 
territories deserves deep respect. He knows that he has to face 
opposition, although part of them are people who are paid for 
the obstruction of peace by foreign countries. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Of whom do you think, of Iran and Iraq? 
  [Mubarak] I would rather not give any names. At any rate, 
'Arafat's courageous decision to negotiate a peace agreement 
with Israel mostly falls on fertile ground. The people are 
yearning for a solution of their problems. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In those days, for his peace agreement, 
al-Sadat got all his territories that were occupied by Israel. 
'Arafat is still far from it. 
  [Mubarak] Yes, yes -- but we did not get it at one go 
either. Al-Sadat's historic peace trip to Jerusalem took place 
in 1977, and only in 1982 did Israel withdraw its last troops 
from Sinai. We had to wait for five years. If the Palestinians 
had initiated the negotiation process earlier, they would have 
become the master of their own land long ago. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If we were members of militant Hamas, we would 
remonstrate with 'Arafat because he gets now his own stamps for 
the two autonomous regions, but not real Palestinian sovereignty. 
  [Mubarak] Do you seriously expect the Palestinians to get 
everything at the same time? What took us Egyptians five years 
will also only happen in stages in the case of the Palestinians. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be advisable to accelerate the 
negotiations for the final solution of the Palestinian problem? 
The massacre at Hebron showed the disruptive potential of 
extremists. 
  [Mubarak] If the autonomy experiment is satisfactory in the 
next two years, the Israelis will also realize that an 
acceleration of the final negotiations will serve their security 
needs best. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what will happen if the autonomy model 
fails? 
  [Mubarak] This process is irrevocable, the wheel of history 
cannot be turned back at will. I cannot imagine that Israel 
will ever reintroduce occupation law in the territories that it 
vacated. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Jewish settlements and the 
problem of East Jerusalem are still blocking the road to 
permanent peace. 
  [Mubarak] Nobody can predict what will happen in the next 
two years. With a certain degree of mutual confidence, however, 
most of the problems can be settled. Palestinians and Israelis 
cannot afford to live in a state of war for another 50 years. 
We are living in a new era, the population figures are 
doubling, and the problems of mankind are increasing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Has Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad also 
understood the signs of the new era? 
  [Mubarak] Yes, Hafiz al-Asad wants peace, I am convinced of 
it. Here the problem is also mutual distrust. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How can it be reduced? 
  [Mubarak] Israel must credibly prove that it will return the 
whole of the Golans. In return, Syria should convince the 
Israelis of its preparedness for real, comprehensive peace. 
Apparently, after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
last visit to Damascus, things were set in motion. I hope very 
much that the Syrians and Israelis will come to terms before the 
end of the year. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Things might also develop in a completely 
different way. If Rabin and 'Arafat fail, Hamas and Likud might 
dominate the scene. 
  [Mubarak] With what alternatives? I do not see any other 
way than negotiations. I hope and pray that 'Arafat and Rabin 
will continue to be able to negotiate. Both have experience of 
many years and know all dimensions of the problem. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you also believe yourself capable of 
playing the role of mediator in the newly erupted conflict in 
Yemen? 
  [Mubarak] Before the outbreak of the hostilities, it would 
have been possible to help bridge the differences of opinion 
between North and South Yemen. I also tried to do this. But 
the distrust on both sides was too great. What is happening now 
is an inner-Yemeni affair. I do not want to interfere. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Then this would be another example of the 
Arabs' inability to solve their conflicts themselves? 
  [Mubarak] What answer am I supposed to give you? The Arabs 
were also unable to solve the problem between Iraq and Kuwait. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What is going to happen in Yemen? Will the 
fighting go on until one of the opponents is vanquished? 
  [Mubarak] The fighting might take years -- topography 
permits this. Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih from the north were 
to conquer Aden, this would by no means be the end of the war. 
Only negotiations with the help of a third country are a way 
out. However, I do not rule out that certain pressure groups 
might try to add fuel to the flames. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] According to various reports, Saudi Arabia is 
said to have sent tanks to South Yemen. 
  [Mubarak] They would be seen. These are unconfirmed rumors. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be better if North and South 
Yemen were to part again instead of forming a coercive unit? 
  [Mubarak] The war seems to confirm this. The north wants to 
preserve the unity of the state at all costs, while the south 
has other ideas -- I do not want to be an arbiter here. The 
Yemeni people have to decide on it themselves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, the ceremony on the occasion 
of the signing of the Palestinian autonomy agreement before 
2,500 guests from all over the world was a success for you. And 
you were probably relieved that there were no incidents, 
although Islamic terrorists are giving you trouble. 
  [Mubarak] I reject the term "Islamic." All of them are 
criminals. Most of them are not versed in Islam at all... 
  [DER SPIEGEL, interrupting] ... but that is what they call 
themselves... 
  [Mubarak, interrupting] ... they have nothing to do with 
Islam, they violate all Islamic rules. They murder innocent 
people, steal, and do things that are not permitted by any 
religion in the world. The motive of these terrorist gangs is 
not Islam, but simply money. They are financed from abroad, we 
can prove this. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The money probably comes from Iran? 
  [Mubarak] Well, from Iran, too. In addition, however, there 
are several well-to-do private persons who make large sums 
available to these criminals, for example, via a bank in Italy. 
I had better not enter into details, the investigations are in 
progress. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do police measures suffice to cope with 
religiously embellished terror or should one not also deal 
politically with the militant Islamists? 
  [Mubarak] I know very well what it means to mix religion 
with politics. The Islamists are interested in power, 
influence, and money. As long as I am the president, religion 
and the state will be separated. We have been familiar with the 
dealings of the Islamic politicians since 1928. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Since the founding of the militant "Muslim 
Brotherhood." Is it still so dangerous? 
  [Mubarak] This is an illegal organization that is behind 
most of the activities of the religious troublemakers. Have a 
look at what happened in Algeria. I advised the former 
president not to permit any religious parties. He flung my 
advice to the winds. Now Algeria is in trouble. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How do you want to cope with the phenomenon of 
Islamic terrorists? 
  [Mubarak] There is terrorism everywhere -- in the United 
States, England, Turkey, and formerly also in Germany. The 
world is full of terrorism. Why are the media concentrating 
just on Egypt, where these terrorists have done relatively 
little damage, as compared to other countries? Egypt is still 
one of the safest countries in the world. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After all, these terrorists have hit Egypt's 
tourism hard and caused your country great financial damage. 
  [Mubarak] Travel around in the country, tourism is beginning 
to be revived everywhere. No, I am not alarmed and I am banking 
on it that there will soon be real peace in our region, the 
peoples' living standard will be raised, and there will no 
longer be any conspiracies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This seems to be an Arab fairy tale. 
  [Mubarak] This is not a dream, but my deeply felt wish. But 
I also know what the Koran says: "The soul is inclined toward 
evil -- unless My Lord has mercy on it." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in London, by </F>
reporter Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from 
the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, 
can you tell us something about the nature of the talks you have 
had with British officials during your current visit to London? 
  [Musa] The talks dealt with many issues. These included 
bilateral issues, regional issues pertaining to the Middle East 
and Africa, and international political and economic issues. 
Therefore, the talks with the prime minister, the foreign 
secretary, other ministers, and members of the House of Commons 
Foreign Affairs Committee were exhaustive and detailed. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What was your impression regarding British 
attitude to these issues, considering that these important 
issues are of interest not only to Egypt but to the entire 
Middle East area? 
  [Musa] I detected British interest in these issues. We are 
interested in talking to all influential states about a number 
of problems, including, for example, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
peace process in the Middle East, and the situations in the 
Gulf, South Africa, and Somalia. All these issues are of 
interest to a large number of states, the important states. 
This is what prompts us to act on the international level. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is the significance of your current 
visit to London at this particular time? 
  [Musa] The purpose of the visit is to hold consultations, 
particularly during the important period preceding the 
resumption of the peace process on the other tracks. The 
purpose is also to consult on the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, the new era that has begun in 
South Africa, the critical situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
which Britain is playing a big role, and a number of other 
existing problems. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Minister Musa, regarding the situation in 
Yemen, everyone is asking which way the Yemeni crisis is 
heading? What do you say? 
  [Musa] I tell you that the Yemeni crisis is extremely bad. 
Fighting and bloodshed cannot augur good or lead to a settlement 
or unity. At any rate, we have been following the situation. 
As you may know, President Husni Mubarak has received envoys 
from both parties to the conflict in Yemen. Egypt is playing an 
extremely active role to contain this crisis. We undertook this 
role even before the outbreak of the fighting. The outbreak of 
fighting introduced new elements into the issue. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can we expect a solution to the Yemeni 
crisis soon, or will it worsen? 
  [Musa] We hope that matters will not reach that point, 
although there is fear now that matters might get out of hand 
unless the fighting stops. I do not think--and we in Egypt do 
not think--that there will be victor or vanquished in this 
conflict. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Minister Musa, what is your opinion of the 
start of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Musa] We hope it will succeed. This is a particularly 
difficult time, and the future of the Palestinian-Israeli 
relations, the settlement of the Palestinian issue, and progress 
on the other tracks depend on it. Therefore, we wish our 
Palestinian brothers success in this endeavor. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, thank you very 
much and we welcome you as always on the airwaves of the Voice 
of the Arabs Radio. 
  [Musa] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has called for an immediate cease-fire between the rival Yemeni 
parties and for the start of a dialogue with help from the Arabs. 
  In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper today, Musa 
said talks should be the basis of the process to salvage Yemeni 
unity and that any military clash will be futile because there 
will be no victor, only bloodshed and continuous conflict. 
  He emphasized that the military conflict strikes at the core 
of Yemeni unity because unity should be based on mutual desire 
and the converging views of everyone--people and leaders. 
  On reports of foreign interventions in the Yemeni war, Musa 
said there is no information in this regard but there is talk 
that there are groups of returnees from Afghanistan who are 
pursuing certain goals in some areas of Yemen, but this issue is 
under strict observation by many countries. 
  Commenting on Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa said he 
intends to visit Sudan soon and noted that he had met with 
Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir and Foreign Minister Husayn 
Sulayman Abu-Salih during the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as 
president of South Africa. 
  In his interview, Musa discussed Egypt's role in the peace 
process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli track. He said Egypt 
does not impose its role, but such a role does exist. He added: 
Naturally, it is not our policy to intervene in certain tracks, 
but the Egyptian role is there and ready to serve the Arab 
brothers, including Syria. 
  Musa said: Egypt does not play the role of mediator in these 
negotiations, because we are an Arab state committed to Arab 
goals-- that is, a comprehensive withdrawal, the Palestinian 
people's right to self-determination, and a comprehensive and 
just peace between the Arabs and Israel. 
  Answering a question on the Lockerbie issue and whether he 
had discussed it in his talks with British officials, he said: 
We explained our stand on this issue to the British officials, 
considering the continuous, intensive contacts between President 
Mubarak and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi. Our clear stand is that we 
are against any further escalation of this issue. 
  On the idea of a Middle Eastern market and asked if there is 
a strategic Egyptian study of the issue, he said: Of course 
Egypt is conducting concentrated studies concerning the region's 
economic future in peacetime. However, Musa added, there is no 
proposal for a Middle Eastern market; the whole issue is no more 
than an idea that has often been floated. He said that there is 
no study about a Middle Eastern market and it will not 
materialize unless peace is established.

  [Text] Brussels, 16 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa has urged the promotion of relations between the European 
Union [EU] and Egypt and launching of a new partnership covering 
political, economic, cultural, technological, and other fields 
"so that we can face the challenges of the future and benefit 
from the opportunities available to us all." 
  In an address to the EU Council this evening, the foreign 
minister said that Egypt is currently studying and analyzing 
this matter from all aspects. "We are ready to begin 
discussions with the EU on a new partnership agreement in the 
near future," he said. 
  The minister began his speech to the Council meeting, which 
is devoted for Egypt, by emphasizing that many developments and 
changes have taken place in Europe and in the Middle East since 
the last meeting between the Council and Egypt in July 1992. 
  In Europe, he noted, the EU itself has been launched, 
reflecting positively on the temporary and future role to be 
played on the level of European relations. In the Middle East, 
important changes have taken place, notably the 4 May Cairo 
Agreement between Israel and the PLO. The agreement, he said, 
opens up important possibilities for achieving peace, stability, 
and security in this region and also reflects positively on 
regional and multilateral cooperation. 
  Among the other changes in the Middle East, Musa pointed 
out, 
is the progress in the peace talks between Israel and other 
sides, and the progress in the multilateral talks, where a 
protocol for economic cooperation between Israel and the PLO was 
signed. 
  All this, Musa said, creates a positive climate to advance 
cooperation and economic, political, and security relations 
between the states of the EU and our region. He added: We hope 
the EU will play its role in entrenching this cooperation. 
This, he went on, should not be at the expense of bilateral 
cooperation between the EU and the region, but should serve as 
an additional avenue to help regional developmental projects and 
projects in the occupied territories. 
  The foreign minister reviewed Egypt's efforts to implement 
the comprehensive economic reform plan in Egypt, the positive 
results of the first phase of the plan, and the start of the 
second phase in a way that will open the door to all-out 
development in Egypt where the private sector plays an important 
role. 
  'Amr Musa reviewed the efforts Egypt has already made on 
its economic reform and privatization programs. He noted these 
efforts and the successes in this field. He stressed the role 
of the EU in supporting Egypt's efforts and backing this program 
"which we are following up with serious steps." 
  He noted his country's efforts in confronting its other 
social and economic problems, beginning with finding solutions 
to unemployment and confronting the housing problems. He also 
noted that Egypt's concern about the population problem is 
apparent in the fact that Egypt will host the international 
population conference in September. 
  In discussing cultural relations between Egypt and the EU, 
the Egyptian foreign minister highlighted the need to make full 
and ideal use of EU allocations of funds and other aid to Egypt 
within the framework of the fourth protocol. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister stressed the importance of 
continuing European investment's role in bolstering the economic 
reform process and providing easy-term loans, especially since 
the World Bank report on Egypt released on 18 April 1994 praised 
the progress in economic reform, particularly the privatization 
process. 
  'Amr Musa noted that Egypt still has to scientifically and 
constructively confront the challenges of developing its human 
resources, encouraging exports, decreasing social burdens, 
protecting the environment, and encouraging investments. It 
needs to do all this to implement the economic reform programs, 
make some progress, and decrease the burden of the low-income 
and working-class sectors. It also has to concentrate on 
exploiting the available resources to absorb new and young work 
potentials. 
  He also spoke about bilateral relations with the EU. He 
asked that the necessary measures be taken to encourage Egyptian 
exports to the EU members in order to realize the joint 
interests of both sides. 
  'Amr Musa spoke about the challenges that emerge after 
signing the GATT agreement. He also highlighted the need to 
find greater opportunities for international trade in the 
international community. He noted the fears of protectionist 
policies. He said that all this makes it necessary to discuss 
and consult with the EU and demand a larger scope for 
cooperation with it. We also ask that it increase the easy-term 
loans and grants it gives us, as well as the food aid to realize 
the food security projects in Egypt and help the poorer classes. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister once again discussed 
developments in Egypt and our region. In particular, he 
addressed the economic changes in Egypt, the future role of the 
EU as an effective factor in the European community, and the 
great possibilities for regional cooperation, especially now 
that the peace agreement has been signed.

  [Text] Brussels, 16 May (MENA) -- The European Union [EU] 
has praised Egypt's role in supporting the Middle East peace 
process despite difficulties and sacrifices. 
  The EU stressed that efforts in this regard, from the Madrid 
conference, through the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of 
Principles signed on 13 September, to the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement in Cairo on 4 May, owe much to Egypt's 
constructive and positive contribution and reflect Egypt's 
consistent and principled policy. 
  This came in a joint statement issued after the ninth 
meeting 
of the Egyptian-European Cooperation Council held in Brussels 
today and chaired by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Greek 
Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, whose 
country chairs the EU Council. 
  The statement said that today's meeting allowed the two 
sides 
to take stock of their relations within the framework of their 
cooperation agreement. It also provided a chance to discuss 
political issues of mutual concern. 
  The EU saluted Egypt's pioneering role in achieving peace in 
the Middle East, describing that role as a strong factor 
creating stability and balance in the region. 
  The two sides recalled the joint action of the EU foreign 
ministers on 19 April to support the Middle East peace process 
and mobilize the EU's political, economic, and financial 
resources to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the 
Middle East. 
  The two sides highlighted their joint efforts to help 
achieve 
greater success in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO 
and make progress on the other bilateral negotiating tracks 
involving Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan on the basis of the 
relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the principles of 
the Madrid conference, including the exchange of land for peace. 
  The statement said the role of both sides in the 
multilateral 
talks emphasizes the commitment of Egypt and the EU to play an 
active and constructive role in the peace process. 
  The two sides agreed on the need for a more active role by 
the committees of the multilateral talks. 
  The two sides stressed that making progress on all the 
bilateral and multilateral tracks of the Middle East peace 
negotiations will achieve development and regional cooperation 
in the region, from which both sides will benefit. 
  The two sides noted the need for peace and security in the 
Mediterranean region. The statement said the two sides aspire 
to rapid efforts to achieve these common interests out of their 
belief that this would help create regional peace and security. 
  Within the framework of bilateral cooperation, the EU noted 
with great interest that Egypt is firmly committed to continuing 
to implement the economic reform program. 
  The joint statement said the private investment sector and 
the export sector represent the basic factor in the success of 
the Egyptian economic reform program. 
  The statement also stressed that the Egyptian Government's 
current policies of liberalizing trade, reforming the structures 
of public establishments, and privatization will inevitably 
reduce the budget deficit and increase investment. 
  The statement said the private sector is the center of 
economic development in Egypt and should be encouraged to make 
the required and appropriate initiatives in this regard. 
  The statement pointed out the EU contribution to achieving a 
series of important programs in Egypt, especially through 
financial protocols. It also pointed out the EU's approval of 
Egypt's programs of privatization and reform of public sector 
establishments with a view to helping Egypt complete its 
economic process. 
  The EU stressed its support for Egypt's efforts to 
liberalize 
its trade and reduce its tariff abroad. 
  The EU expressed support for Egypt's request to increase its 
exports to the EU market so as to redress the trade balance 
deficit. 
  In response to the offer by the European side, Egypt 
expressed willingness to start exploratory talks with the EU 
soon on a new partnership agreement covering every area of 
cooperation. 
  The two sides welcomed the initiative to discover new forms 
of cooperation between them in accordance with a new agreement 
reflecting all the aspects of their special relations. 
  The joint statement said the European side will report to 
the 
council on the results of those talks and make appropriate 
proposals.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- An official security source 
at the Interior Ministry today announced that the security 
forces raided 11 hideouts at the same time in the Governorates 
of Cairo, al-Jizah, Ismailia, al-Daqahliyah, and al-Qalyubiyah 
arresting the associates of terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the 
leader of the terrorist groups. They represent the command 
group, which includes the base of the organization's military 
wing in the central region, and the officials in charge of 
surveillance, finance, liaison, and implementation. 
  In the security campaigns, seven modern vehicles of various 
types were seized. One of those cars was used in the 
assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat in al-Haram 
on 9 April and another in the attack against the officers of Abu 
Za'bal prison on 26 March, when explosive charges were thrown at 
them on the Cairo-Ismailia agricultural road. 
  When residences of members of the command and implementation 
groups were searched, large amounts of explosive, chemical, and 
incendiary materials were found along with some sketches and 
information about officials on the assassination list and some 
cash. 
  The source said the operation was part of activity by the 
State Security Intelligence following the death of Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, the leader of the terrorist groups. Security operations 
were developed using information and seized organizational 
papers about all recent terrorist activities. 
  The source said that in light of information gathered from 
close surveillance of some terrorists abroad and their contacts 
inside the country, the State Security Intelligence managed to 
define the general picture of the terrorists' activity and of 
certain internal organizations trying to support those 
terrorists and push them to implement their various operations. 
  Acting on this information, the source explained, the State 
Security Intelligence, assisted by the various investigative 
agencies, continued to implement its security plan to arrest the 
remaining terrorist groups that by their acts are trying to 
prove they still exist in the country. 
  The source said that the operation was also based on the 
intensive investigations and accurate monitoring carried out by 
the State Security Intelligence after receiving permission from 
the chief public attorney and in coordination with antiterrorism 
forces and the various criminal investigation agencies. 
  The official security source said that, still backed by the 
permission of the High State Security Prosecution Office, the 
security forces extended the arrest operations to include those 
responsible for liaison and conveying assignments from the 
leaders of the organization inside prisons to leaders outside. 
It became certain that this liaison mission was carried out by 
two lawyers who used their profession to serve their secret 
organizational activities. One of these is lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Ibrahim Madani, who was arrested and 
accused in connection with several extremist cases in Isna in 
the Governorate of Qina. Investigations and seized 
organizational documents proved that he was also in charge of 
financing the organization from funds he received from the 
leader of these groups, Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam. 
  The source said the suspect distributed sums amounting to 
45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000. 
  The security source pointed out that this suspect is one of 
the dangerous terrorist elements that played a prominent role in 
the recent terrorist acts. He was arrested on 3 July 1990 for 
his dangerous activity in the terrorist groups, and in the same 
year he, along with others, were charged with attacking citizens 
in Isna and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. He was 
also accused in Case No. 4116 in 1991 in Isna, when he was 
arrested for distributing leaflets promoting extremist thought 
and inciting violence. 
  The source said the High State Security Prosecution issued a 
warrant for his arrest for his involvement in Case No. 235 of 
1994, concerning the military wing of the terrorist groups 
organization, which is currently being examined. 
  The security source said that the defendants told State 
Security Prosecution investigators that Madani was their link to 
the group's leader, Hammam. Madani was also in charge of 
communication between the group's imprisoned and free leaders, a 
task he performed under cover of his work as a lawyer and on the 
orders of Hammam. 
  The source said that the defendants' confessions also show 
that Madani was in charge of the finances of the group. 
Investigators have learned of seven instances in which Madani 
received funds from abroad totalling 45,000 Egyptian pounds and 
$3,000. The entire sum was used to finance the group's 
terrorist activities. 
  Security forces arrested Madani on the night of 26 April at 
his office in al-Haram, the source said. They took him along as 
they searched his home in al-Talibiyah in al-Haram. There 
security sources seized documents and other material. While the 
security forces were leading Madani to his second residence in 
Warraq al-'Arab, which they intended to search, he experienced 
difficulty in breathing and lost consciousness. He was 
instantly taken to the al-Manyal al-Jami'i hospital for 
treatment, where doctors diagnosed his case as severe asthma and 
kept him in the hospital for treatment. The next day, 27 April, 
the hospital notified us that the defendant had died of lung 
failure, a complication of severe asthma, the source said. 
  The security source added that the State Security 
Intelligence forces continued to act on the information they had 
already gathered. Acting in cooperation with other security 
organs, they prepared plans to raid 25 hideouts of the military 
wing of the extremist terrorist groups in farm and mountain 
areas in the Asyut and Suhaj Governorates. 
  In these hideouts, the security forces seized four automatic 
weapons, a pistol, 1,600 7.62-mm rounds, 300 9-mm rounds, 18 kg 
of TNT, 29 detonators, six timers, and electric wiring devices. 
The raids also led to the arrest of the deputy leader of the 
military wing of the terrorist groups in south Egypt. The 
officials in charge of communications and accommodations were 
also arrested. So was a group of terrorists wanted by police in 
connection with 40 terrorist attacks against police officials, 
trains, and Nile cruise boats in south Egypt. The defendants 
have been referred to the competent prosecution offices. 
  The individuals who were arrested in these raids confessed 
to 
involvement in the assassination of Asyut Security Commander 
Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi; and Lieutenant Colonel 
Mustafa Khalil Tuni and First Lieutenant Zaki Bahjat, both of 
the Asyut Security Department. They also admitted involvement 
in the attack on Bank Abu-Tij in Asyut and the bombing in 
al-Bunuk Square in Asyut, according to the Interior Ministry 
source. 
  The security source noted that as a result of these 
security operations against the leaders, cadres, and members of 
the terrorist elements, 98 leading figures have been arrested 
and approximately 500,000 Egyptian pounds have been seized. In 
addition, a Goryunov machine gun, five automatic weapons, three 
pistols, three Enfield automatic rifles, a Russian-made pistol, 
25 FON [initials as received] bombs, a large quantity of live 
ammunition, 190 kg of highly explosive TNT, a large quantity of 
chemicals, ready-made explosive devices and tools and material 
for making them, fax machines, and wireless telephones have been 
seized. 
  The source noted that the Higher State Security Prosecution 
Office is questioning the arrested defendants. Prosecutors have 
also inspected all the places and dens where the defendants were 
arrested and have seized all items found there as part of the 
investigations. The source pointed out that to maintain the 
confidentiality of the investigations, the State Security 
Intelligence has not announced the names of all the defendants 
since more arrests are being conducted. The source noted that 
investigations and surveillance operations are still underway to 
arrest the remaining terrorists still at large, who include the 
following important figures: Hasan Salih Hasan Mahmud, Hasan 
al-Sayyid Hamid Khayri, Mahmud Muhammad Sa'id Salim, Jamal 
'Abd-al-Hamid 'Abd-al-Nasir, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi 
'Abd-al-Baqi, Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah, Islam Ahmad Muhammad 
Ibrahim al-Ghamri. In addition, there are other terrorist 
elements whose activities are being monitored abroad. 
  The Interior Ministry appeals to citizens who have any 
information on these terrorists to report it to the nearest 
police station. It stresses that it is fully aware of all the 
activities by some quarters that are supporting terrorism in one 
way or another to serve their own interests. These quarters use 
some of the incidents that may occur in the course of the 
confrontation with terrorists as an opportunity to boost their 
own image among the masses. The ministry emphasizes that it 
will stand firmly and decisively against these quarters should 
they try to act against law and order under this cover, which 
only aims to create unrest among the masses. 
  The source added that the Interior Ministry is keeping a 
close watch on the activities of the terrorist groups while 
adhering to its firm stances that abide by the law. It 
appreciates the people's support for its decisive confrontation 
with the criminal and terrorist elements targeting the nation. 
The ministry will announce within a few days the names of a 
number of arrested terrorists who have repented and renounced 
extremism and all forms of terrorist practices. 
  While emphasizing this strong position, the Interior 
Ministry 
calls on the people to adhere to the principles of religion and 
denounce the terrorist acts that run contrary to the noble 
Islamic faith and undermine the march of economic reform, which 
seeks to serve the interests of the nation and its people.

  [Text] Cairo, May 15 (AFP) -- Most of Egypt's 180,000 
lawyers went on strike Sunday [15 May] to protest the death of a 
jailed lawyer who was allegedly tortured. 'Abd-al-Harith Madani 
died the day after being arrested on April 26 on charges that he 
had acted as a go-between for imprisoned members of the Islamic 
militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and those abroad. 
  The Egyptian lawyers, who normally work on Sundays, also 
plan 
a protest march on a palace of President Husni Mubarak on 
Tuesday. They have demanded the release of 34 lawyers held 
without charge and to take part in an inquiry into Madani's 
death. 
  The prosecutor's office said Thursday that an initial 
autopsy 
showed the lawyer had died after being tortured. But the 
Interior Ministry said two days later that Madani had died from 
an asthma attack before even being questioned. 
It said his asthma attack had started at his home where he had 
been taken by security services and that Madani was immediately 
brought to hospital where he later died. But his family was 
only told of his death on May 6. 
  The ministry said Madani had been a "terrorist leader" of 
al-Jama'ah, which has waged a two-year-long campaign of violence 
against the government, and that it had documents to prove the 
allegation. 
  Mukhtar Nuh, a member of the bar association, rejected the 
explanation that Madani had died of natural causes, saying if 
that were true "the security services would not have waited nine 
days to inform his family." 
  "Even if he was accused of belonging to an armed group, that 
doesn't give the state the right to kill him," added Nuh, whose 
association is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has ordered the release of a large number of detainees 
who, according to the State Security Intelligence services, have 
renounced extremism, departure from the right religion, and 
terrorist practices. 
  The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying these 
releases demonstrate that various police agencies are fully 
aware of movements of terrorist groups at home and abroad. It 
also proves that these agencies firmly adhere to law and 
legitimacy, honestly shoulder their national responsibility, and 
highly appreciate the public's support for them in their 
decisive confrontation with bloody terrorism and its elements, 
which target the nation and its interests. 
  An official security source at the Interior Ministry 
stressed 
that the release reflects a firm and credible policy by the 
Ministry regarding the emergency law; namely, that it should not 
be applied except against the elements that pose a threat to 
society. 
  The source said that these release orders will be 
implemented 
within hours, and will be followed by releases of other 
detainees whose files and positions on terrorism and extremism 
are now being reviewed by the State Security Intelligence 
agencies.

  [Text] Mecca, May 16, IRNA -- The headquarters of the 
representative of the leader of the Islamic revolution here was

the eve of the "Disavowal of the Unbelievers" ceremony, due here

  The Saudi police has increased the number of personnel near 
the headquarters and stationed tens of military vehicles 
carrying security forces and commandos and 10 armoured personnel 
carriers equipped with machine gun and water cannon. The forces 
are also equipped with tear gas. 
  Last year, the Saudi police surrounded the headquarters a 
day 
before the rally and prevented people from approaching the 
place. The siege was lifted when pilgrims left for 'Arafat and 
Manni deserts for special Hajj rituals. 
  This year, the headquarters was surrounded after a large 
gathering of Muslims in solidarity with Bosnian people ended. 
Iran declared May 15 the Day of Support for Bosnian People. 
  Hojatt ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader's 
representative for Hajj-related affairs, said that the Disavowal 
of Unbelievers ceremony would be held in front of the 
headquarters on Tuesday if no restrictions are set by the Saudi 
Government. He called on pilgrims to remain calm and orderly 
during the ceremony.

  [Text] Mecca, May 17, IRNA -- Three battalions of Saudi 
Arabian police have been mobilized in front of the headquarters 
of Iranian pilgrims in anticipation of the annual `Disavowal of 
Polytheists' rally, which was however cancelled by the leader of 
the Iranian pilgrims in order to ensure that the Saudis have no 
excuse for desecrating the holy sanctuary. 
  The Saudi forces are heavily armed and equipped with machine 
guns, armoured personnel carriers, tear gas cannisters and water 
cannons. 
  The battalions have arrayed themselves in the form of a 
triangle in the northeastern side of holy Mecca. One battalion 
has taken up position at al-Aziz street at the site of the 
Iranian pilgrim headquarters. This battalion forms the point of 
the invasion triangle of the Saudi commandos. The main part of 
the equipments and personnel of this batallaion are seen in the 
al-Azizieh school which is precisely in front of the Iranian 
pilgrim headquarters. 
  In the Azizieh street there is another battalion that is 
completely ready. 
  In addition to these forces, dozens of private cars are seen 
on different sides of the triangle stopping and interrogating 
unsuspecting pilgirms to the holiest sanctuary of Islam. 
  Many pilgrims who pass this region interpret the abnormal 
movements of the Saudi police as disrespect of the divine 
sanctuary. The insulting behaviour of the Saudi police with 
pilgrims from various countries in many cases has met stong 
objection. 
  In view of the provocative behaviour of the Saudis, Hojat 
ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader of the Islamic 
revolution's representative for the Hajj, was forced to call off 
the annual rally which was planned for Tuesday May 17. 
  The rally in accordance with the spirit of the Hajj aims to 
promote Islamic unity and awaken the ummah to the plots of 
enemies against them. 
  Quite strangely the Saudis are averse to this all-important 
rally and on one such occasion in 1987, Saudi security forces 
massacred over 400 Iranian pilgrims near the most inviolable of 
sanctuaries where the shedding of even an animal's blood is 
divinely prohibited.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 16 (AFP) -- Northern troops loyal to 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Monday [16 May] were 
pushing forward to capture the southern oil province of Shabwah, 
a northern spokesman in Sanaa said. 
  The northern forces are also on the move on three other 
fronts to blockade Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's stronghold 
of the southern port-city of Aden, and force him and his 
followers to surrender. 
  Northern ground forces, including tanks and heavy artillery, 
were trying to reach Aden in an pincer movement from the north, 
along the Sanaa-Aden road, Zanjibar to the west, and Abyan to 
the east. 
  The spokesman said the fighting in Shabwah, 300 kilometers 
(180 miles) northeast of Aden, is centered on northern attempts 
to capture the main city of 'Ataq, and another town, Bayhan. 
  Al-Bid's forces are using extensive air power to check the 
advancing troops, including firing long range Scud missiles, the 
spokesman added. 
  A defeat for the southerners in Shabwah would deprive them 
of 
Massila oil field revenues, set at 170,000 barrels per day. 
Massila's output is shipped by pipeline to the southern port of 
Mukalla. 
  It would mean that all of Yemen's oil resources would be in 
the hands of Salih, since his troops already control the other 
key oil province of Ma'arib, 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of 
Sanaa. It produces 140,000 barrels per day. 
  Elsewhere, the northern forces are trying to clear the way 
to 
the southern Al-Anad air base, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of 
Aden, defended by more than 20,000 soldiers and militiamen. 
  A southern military commander on Sunday said the northern 
troops were spotted 30 kilometres (18 miles) away from the base. 
  In Abyan, 55 kilometers (33 miles) east of Aden, the 
northern 
crack brigade al-'Amaliqah was trying to capture the heights 
surrounding Aden. 
  The brigade commander, Colonel 'Ali al-Jayfi, said his 
forces 
were between 15 and 20 kilometers (nine and 13 miles) from the 
southern port. 
  The northern forces are also trying to drive their rivals 
from the coastal road linking Aden to Kharaz, to the west. 
  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad al-Basindwah, who is loyal 
to the president, said that the northern forces want to blockade 
Aden to force the surrender of al-Bid and his followers, but not 
to take the city, in order to "save lives and facilities." 
  The southerners made a new ceasefire offer on Sunday, 
proposing a national unity government. 
  The northern leadership has demanded that the southerners 
surrender before halting fighting, which began almost two weeks 
ago.

  [Excerpts] Instructed by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, Local Administration Minister 
Muhammad Hasan Dammaz continued his field inspection tours of a 
number of areas and districts in the southern governorates of 
our country which have been purged from the filth of the 
apostate and secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  The local administration minister yesterday visited the 
Mukayris district in Abyan Governorate. He was welcomed on his 
arrival in Mukayris by brother Staff Colonel Muhammad Isma'il 
Ahmad, the axis staff officer; Muhammad 'Abd-Rabbuh Dahnan, 
commissioner general of the Mukayris district; a number of 
district officials; officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers from the 8th Special Forces Brigade; and a large crowd 
of citizens from the Mukayris district. 
  The brother local administration minister visited the 20th 
Brigade's camp which had been purged and recovered from the 
YSP's apostate and secessionist forces by the men of our Armed 
Forces, the gallant heroes of the Special Forces Brigade, and 
with the support of citizens supporting the constitutional 
legitimacy and Yemeni unity. 
  Brother Muhammad Hasan Dammaz toured various positions in 
the 
camp and inspected its strong fortifications, which were built 
in accordance with the most up-to-date military systems. He 
also visited several weapons stockrooms in various parts of the 
camp, which contained thousands of ammunition boxes, weapons, 
batteries, artillery pieces, and antiaircraft guns. He also 
inspected large numbers of tanks, guns, and automatic machine 
guns that have been seized from the 20th Brigade after fierce 
battles waged by our Armed Forces against the forces of 
injustice and aggression, giving the most glorious examples of 
heroism and sacrifice. [passage omitted] 
  The brother local administration minister also met in the 
same camp with the officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers of the 30th Brigade, who, together with their weapons 
and equipment, joined our Armed Forces, the forces of justice 
and defense of the constitutional legitimacy and unity.

  [Text] A responsible military source at the Defense 
Ministry has stated the following: 
  With God Almighty's support and guidance to the courageous, 
loyal heroes in our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of 
protecting unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and with the 
willpower of the valiant fighters, units of the Armed Forces 
continued to fulfill their combat tasks against the 
secessionist, rebellious forces in the Socialist Party 
leadership, and those who are following its orders and who lost 
their willpower and logic and all sense of responsibility, 
inflicting heavy losses on them on all axes and sectors. 
  On the Shabwah axis, our troops completed the mopping up of 
Bayhan district from the elements of secession and apostasy in 
cooperation with the honorable citizens of Bayhan district. Our 
forces yesterday regained control of Mulhim Brigade with its 
heavy and medium weapons, including 22 tanks, five katyusha 
BM-21 vehicles, a number of armed crews, and a large quantity of 
ammunition. A number of officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the 
Mulhim Brigade joined the legitimacy troops, announcing their 
adherence to unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy. 
  On the Abyan axis, our Armed Forces continued their advance 
and are now closing on al-'Alam point. 
  On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the 14th Battalion of the 
22d 
Infantry Brigade, with all its ordnance, joined the forces of 
Constitutional legitimacy. All members of the battalion 
announced their refusal to fight with the forces of rebellion 
and the gang of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party 
leadership. 
  At the same time, the forces of legitimacy continued their 
advance toward al-'Anad Base and took control of the area in 
which the base is located on the Ta'izz-Aden-al-Dali' 
crossroads. They then completed their seige of the base from 
all the directions to allow the elements deceived by the gang of 
apostasy and secession at the Socialist Party leadership the 
opportunity to join the forces of Constitutional legitimacy. 
  Today, our Air Force pilots carried out their missions in 
the 
battlefield, achieving the set objectives. All planes returned 
safely to base. 
  Our Armed Forces units continue to receive in succession the 
officers, NCO's, and soldiers who are joining the Armed Forces, 
the forces for protecting unity and Constitutional legitimacy. 
They voiced their rejection of the instructions and hegemony of 
the secessionist, rebellious forces and their denunciation of 
that gang and its major crimes against the people, the Armed 
Forces and security troops. They also expressed their readiness 
to sacrifice for the sake or unity and to protect Constitutional 
legitimacy and democracy in the country. 
  Here we underline the dark fate which the secessionist 
rebels 
must meet thanks to the heroism of the entire Yemeni people, 
headed by those who take pride in belonging to the Armed Forces 
and security troops, who defend the people and the homeland and 
its eternal achievements, and who confront any one who may be 
tempted to infringe on them. They are, and will always remain, 
the men protecting the lives of all citizens and the homeland's 
security and stability and protectors of property, freedoms, 
rights, and honor in all governorates and cities. 
  Those who circulate lies and spread false rumors will only 
fail. 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: And 
soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their 
affairs will take. [Koranic verse]

  [Text] Sanaa, May 16 (AFP) -- Northern troops on Monday [16 
May] captured the south's main air base of Al-'Anad which 
controls a key highway leading to the southern stronghold of 
Aden, the official Yemeni news agency SABA said. 
  The agency, run by the north, said Salih's troops were 
"mopping up the last pockets of the rebel forces in Al-'Anad 
base," around 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of the port city.

  [Text] Communications with Yemen these days are very 
difficult. Despite this, we succeeded in establishing telephone 
contact with 'Abd-al-Qadir Bajammal, former minister and deputy, 
and member of the general committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
Regrettably, the telephone contact was poor from the technical 
point of view. 
  In this interview, Bajammal confirmed to us the fall of 
al-'Anad base. He also said that the Central Command in Sanaa 
has no intention to storm Aden militarily. We asked him about 
Sanaa's stand on Arab mediations after we asked him, of course, 
about why Sanaa has rejected the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] 
recent proposal to immediately stop the fighting and resume 
dialogue. 
  He said: [Begin recording] [Bajammal] First, about the talk 
that the YSP has submitted a proposal. In reality, the proposal 
should have been the basis for tackling the Yemeni crisis which 
the YSP has concocted. The YSP wants to destroy the 
constitutional and legitimate institutions through military 
rebellion, and through political rebellion. That's why those 
who ask such a thing should first of all respect constitutional 
legitimacy, the legitimacy of the elections, and the law. 
That's why this request cannot be accepted from one party which 
has destroyed legitimacy, has flouted legitimacy, and has 
undermined all the results of the democratic actions that have 
been scored over the past unionist years. 
  [Salamah] There are Yemeni delegations from the north and 
the 
south that are currently visiting Arab countries, and Arab 
mediations, as yet, have not attained any tangible result on the 
ground in Yemen. Are you ready to deal with Arab mediations and 
calls to stop the fighting and resume dialogue? 
  [Bajammal] First, the mediators, or those who are concerned 
over Yemen, its safety, and its security should primarily be 
concerned that safety and stability in Yemen consists of respect 
for its legitimacy, and the respect of the people's will in the 
elections. This is a basic rule. To respect the Yemenis, we 
must respect their will. This is the most important thing. If 
we want a any mediation to have any effect, this mediation first 
of all should not be biased to a specific viewpoint, and assess 
it as being a dispute outside thr framework of legitimacy. It 
is a dispute to entrench legitimacy and the Yemeni popular will. 
If any mediation does not respect this, the mediation, in my 
opinion, will become useless. In other words, it will be a 
mediation that proceeds from an erroneous understanding of the 
Yemeni state of affairs, a concept that is no longer valid 
because we possess a constitution, and a House of 
Representatives that came into existence as a result of general 
and democratic elections. What do we want after this? What is 
more important than this is that they address the forces within 
the YSP which rebelled against legitimacy and inform them that 
this is absolutely unacceptable. This is the real introduction 
to any mediation, and not to equate those who abide by 
legitimacy with those who undermine it and force Yemen to take a 
leap into the unknown. [end recording]

  [Text] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense has 
categorically denied that the forces of the adventurous and 
bloody al-Ahmar gang have seized al-'Anad base. The source also 
denied that any units of the forces of unity, democracy, and 
modernization or any of their men had surrendered as claimed by 
self-deluded military sources in Sanaa. 
  The responsible source at the Ministry of Defense said the 
forces of unity, democracy, and modernization were fighting 
heroic defensive battles in the direction of the 
Karish-al-Rahidah area. They were registering immortal results 
and achieving sweeping victories about which we need not boast 
as is done by the news media of the criminal gang of al-Ahmar. 
  It concerns us to confirm, however, to our Yemeni people and 
Arab and international public that we are fighting a battle to 
defend our people's dignity and hordes and their right to a free 
and decent life. Our forces are resisting with rare courage and 
bravery beyond description the barbaric hordes pushed by the 
al-Ahmar gang into the option of: the enemy is before you and 
the sea is behind you. We have only one option: a free and 
decent life. Victory is our ally and God is great.

  [Text] Aden, May 17 (AFP) -- Fierce battles raged around a 
key air base Tuesday [17 May] as southern Yemeni forces, backed 
by warplanes, tried to prevent northern forces from advancing on 
Aden, witnesses said. 
  The northerners, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
captured al-'Anad airbase on Monday, opening the way for a push 
toward Aden, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south. 
  "Fierce battles have raged around Al-'Anad since the early 
morning," said one of the witnesses. 
  The southerners, backed by warplanes were "trying to push 
back the advance" of pro-Salih forces on the southern stronghold 
of Aden, said the witness. 
  He added however, that northern forces seemed better 
equipped 
and more organized than their southern rivals. 
  The northern troops, backed by tanks, artillery and 
anti-aircraft batteries, captured the base on Monday and cut off 
southern troops, an AFP photographer said. 
  But the southerners later claimed to have recaptured the 
base, and the intensity of Tuesday's fighting made it impossible 
to say who was in control. 
  Southern warplanes were bombing the newly-won northern 
positions, defying anti-aircraft fire. 
  The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5, after months 
of arguing over how to run the country, formed from the 
unification in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and poorer, 
Marxist South Yemen.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense has 
stated the following: In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. If God helps you, none can overcome you. 
[Koranic verse] With God's support and with the courage of the 
heroes of the valiant Armed Forces, their heroic capabilities, 
and high combat skills, the forces protecting Yemeni unity and 
championing constitutional legitimacy completely destroyed all 
fortifications in the al-'Anad military base yesterday evening. 
This morning, these forces were able to fully control the base 
after the expiry of the time given to the personnel who were 
misled by the secessionist and rebellious gang in the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] to allow them to join the forces of 
legitimacy. At dawn today, Tuesday, our valiant Armed Forces 
ended the military legend that used to surround the al-'Anad 
base, its fortifications, and the various weaponry it had stored 
in its base and secret cellars. A large part of it was turned 
into rubble. Scattered concrete piles, destroyed weapons and 
vehicles, and remnants of ash tell the story of the crazy 
arrogance of the gang of rebellion, apostasy, and secession in 
the YSP. With this military arsenal and other military 
ammunition, this gang thought it could be above the people's 
will and be greater than their constitutional institutions. 
  But God Almighty, the people, and the Armed Forces were 
lying 
in wait for all of this. Thus, their plans were foiled and the 
rebels received their punishment. 
  In addition, our Armed Forces managed to seize what was left 
of the variety of military hardware. Units of our brave Armed 
Forces are now finishing their missions, after the Yemeni 
homeland has irrevocably passed the danger of the threat posed 
by the rebellious secessionists to unity and democracy. 
  Praise be to God who has supported the fighters with his 
victory. God is the best to protect and the best to help.

  [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni 
House of Representatives, has asserted that the forces loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have decided the military 
situation in their favor following the seizure of the southern 
major base of al-'Anad. In a statement to the Qatari News Agency 
over the phone, al-Ahmar said that the crisis has ended, 
affirming that the southern units, which have joined the 
northerners, are now fighting against the rebellious forces in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  Al-Ahmar rejected the YSP's call to form a national 
salvation 
government and said: This means nobody is running the country's 
affairs.

  [Text] Military communique No. 19 by the Defense Ministry 
says that in the wake of the failure of the al-Ahmar's plans to 
bring our Yemeni people to their knees and in spite of the heavy 
losses inflicted on the brutal military mechanism in Abyan and 
Mukayris, and the Qa'tabah-al-Dali' and al-Rahidah-Karish and 
Bab al-Mandeb-Kharaz areas by the armed forces of the unity and 
the masses, and instead of (?learning) lessons from these 
losses, the al-Ahmar gang continue their adventurous actions by 
igniting the war in other parts of the republic. The communique 
said that the al-Ahmar gang had plunged its forces in to attack 
Bayhan Province in Shabwah Governorate, but our forces, in close 
cooperation with the masses in this district, repelled this 
treacherous action of the al-Ahmar gang and turned them away. 
Our forces in Bayhan District are continuing the repulsion of 
the al-Ahmar gang forces. The Defense Ministry expressed 
confidence that all plots and actions of the al-Ahmar gang which 
are supported by some groups, particularly in Abyan, will be 
doomed to failure and all their plots will be smashed on the 
steadfastness of our armed forces.

  [Text] Aden, May 17 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops Monday 
[16 May] took the rival south's main air base at al-'Anad, 
opening the way for a push towards the southern capital Aden, 
some 50 kilometres (30 miles) to the south, an AFP photographer 
on the spot said. 
  As the northern soldiers consolidated, opposition parties 
led 
by vice-president 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the southern leader, 
announced here early Tuesday they would form a High Council for 
National Salvation. 
  'Abd-al Rahman al-Jifri, who chairs a bloc of five 
opposition 
parties, told AFP the council would function wherever it had 
influence, not just in southern Yemen. 
  "In no way does this mean the formation of a government of 
South Yemen," al-Jifri said. 
  He said the decision to form a High Council was prompted by 
the constitutional vacuum and the illegality of the political 
institutions in the country. 
  Around 50 northerners were patrolling the perimeter of the 
al-'Anad air base Monday and the junction of the two main roads 
to the northern capital Sanaa, an AFP photographer said. 
  Backed by tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft batteries, they 
took up position around 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), cutting off 
southern troops further north. 
  The official north Yemeni news agency SABA' reported Monday 
afternoon that the base had fallen to northern troops, who were 
mopping up resistance inside the base. 
  Southern warplanes were bombing newly-won northern 
positions, 
defying anti-aircraft fire. 
  Al-Jifri implicitly recognised that the base, garrisoned by 
20,000 men, had fallen, saying that its weaponry had been 
removed. 
  "The northerners knew all the military and artillery 
positions inside the base, so it was only natural that we took 
out the heavy artillery to hide it elsewhere," he said. 
  The base appeared deserted Monday evening, but heavy 
fighting 
was going on in the surrounding hills. 
  The AFP photographer at the base said the gun turrets on the 
northerners' tanks were turned towards the south. 
  Asked if they had come from Aden or Sanaa, the soldiers 
replied joyously: "Sanaa." 
  Some five kilometres separated the northern troops and the 
southern army, which was bringing up heavy artillery and 
pounding northerners' positions. 
  Truckloads of civilians were fleeing in panic either towards 
Aden or to the mountains in the north. 
  The northern army has been concentrating its efforts on the 
strategic route for the past few days. 
  Heavy fighting was also reported on the eastern front some 
40 
kilometres (24 miles) from Aden, and journalists trying to get 
there were sent back by southern troops. 
  Warplanes were continuously landing and taking off from Aden 
throughout Monday evening, but the local population remained 
calm. 
  The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5 after months 
of 
arguing over how to run the country, formed from the unification 
in May 1990 of conservative North Yemen and poorer, Marxist 
South Yemen.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today received U.S. 
Ambassador Arthur Hughes who conveyed a message to the president 
from the U.S. Administration related to the developments in our 
country and issues of concern to the two friendly countries. 
  The SABA' news agency learns that the message referred to 
the 
firm U.S. stand on unification of the homeland on 22 May 1990, 
and its support for Yemeni unity and democracy, the march of 
stability, and the free market economy policy in the Yemeni 
Republic. The message stressed the U.S. desire to put a 
peaceful end to the current dispute within the framework of 
unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. 
  The Presidential Council chairman voiced his appreciation 
for 
the U.S. attitude toward our country and its desire to support 
unity, democracy, and political pluralism. He alluded to the 
challenges which the Socialist Party's rebellious and 
secessionist gang wanted to impose on the homeland and the 
people by opting for war and its endeavors to implement its 
secessionist plot to dismember the homeland. He asserted that 
the Yemeni people's choice is unity and democracy and there can 
be no retreat from this choice. He said that during the coming 
phase, efforts will be pooled to compensate for the shortcomings 
of the previous phase and to build more, based on unity, 
democracy, political pluralism, respect for human rights, 
comprehensive development, and developing local government on 
the basis of decentralization in administration, finance, and 
social progress. 
  The meeting was attended by Planning and Development 
Minister 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, today received an Arab League 
delegation under Major General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab 
League assistant secretary general for military affairs. During 
the meeting, discussions dealt with the developments in our 
country in light of the explosion of the military situation and 
the rebellion against the legitimate authority by the apostate 
and secessionist gang in the Socialist Party's leadership. 
  The brother chairman briefed the Arab League delegation on 
current developments, pointing out the subversive role that has 
been played by the rebellious, secessionist gang in the 
Socialist Party's leadership since 19 August 1993, including 
what happened in Abyan on the eve of the signing of the pledge 
and accord document, the explosion of the military situation in 
Harth Sufyan, Shabwah, 'Imran, and then in Dhamar and later in 
Aden against the central security personnel and the 2d Armored 
Brigade in al-Rahah in Lahij. He also reviewed what is currently 
taking place on various axes of combat. 
  The brother chairman held the rebellious, secessionist 
clique 
responsible for igniting the war, imposing it on our people and 
the legitimate leadership, and leading the country into its 
current situation. He stressed that the secessionist gang 
represents a small clique that has violated the people's will 
and national consensus and rebelled against the constitutional 
legitimacy to implement its secessionist plan and dismember the 
homeland. He indicated that the security organs recently 
discovered large quantities of weapons stockpiled by that gang 
in various parts of Sanaa and other cities to spread chaos in 
the country, foment sedition among the children of our people, 
and abort unity and democracy. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman said he is 
confident the brothers and friends would understand the reality 
that what is taking place in Yemen is a domestic affair and a 
rebellion by the secessionist gang against legitimacy and unity. 
He also said that the secessionist, rebellious, and adventurous 
elements which made the decision to go to war should recognize 
unity and constitutional legitimacy and give themselves up to be 
fairly tried, or leave the homeland to avert our people and 
their Armed Forces further bloodshed. He stressed his eagerness 
for dialogue within the framework of safeguarding unity, 
democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. He also highly valued 
the Arab League's role and its concern for legitimacy and 
safeguarding Yemeni unity, given that it is a national gain for 
the Arab nation. 
  He said that our country can never do without the role of 
the 
Arab League and of all the brothers and friends in standing to 
the side of our Yemeni people, supporting Yemeni unity, and 
Yemen's democratic course, and its constitutional institutions. 
  For his part, the brother Arab League assistant secretary 
general has emphasized the Arab League's concern for Yemen's 
unity and for security and stability in Yemen. He stressed that 
the Arab League is ready to play any role that will safeguard 
Yemen's safety within the framework of unity and legitimacy.

  [Text] An Arab League delegation led by brother Major 
General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab League assistant 
secretary general for military affairs, left Sanaa today 
following a visit to our country. 
  During the visit, Maj. Gen. Bayraqdar conveyed a message to 
brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
from Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', brother 
Bayraqdar explained that the brother Presidential Council 
chairman yesterday briefed the delegation on the Yemeni 
situation and on the great opportunities and concessions given 
to the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] in order to safeguard 
Yemeni unity. However, none of these achieved any result, Salih 
added. Thus, the possibility of cease-fire is ruled out unless 
the YSP elements which rebelled against legitimacy and which are 
responsible for these events either leave the country or 
surrender to legitimacy. 
  Bayraqdar pointed out that the brother Presidential Council 
chairman and other officials in Sanaa welcomed the role the Arab 
League is playing. 
  The delegation was seen off by brother [word indistinct] [? 
Sami], deputy head of the Arab Homeland Department at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs; a representative of the 
Presidential Council Protocol Office; and brother 'Ata Harun, 
Egyptian ambassador in Sanaa.

  [Text] An agreement on principles for national salvation 
was announced in Aden yesterday evening during a news conference 
held at the Aden hotel attended by brothers 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
the vice president of the Presidential Council and secretary 
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] central Committee; 
Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, head of the secretarial staff of the YSP 
Central Committee; Anis Hasan Yahya, member of the YSP 
politburo; and leaders of Yemeni parties who signed the 
agreement including brothers 'Umar al-Jawi, chairman of the 
Unionist Patriotic Alliance; Muhammad Rawih of the Union of the 
Popular Forces; Muhammad Afif of the Nasirist Popular 
Organization; and 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri of the League of the 
Sons of Yemen. It was also attended by a number of local, Arab, 
and international representatives of radio and television. 
  Brother 'Umar al-Jawi read the agreement on principles for 
national unity signed by the national opposition bloc and the 
YSP. It provides for implementing the pledge and accord 
agreement and defining the mechanism for implementing the 
document in light of the initiative of the national opposition 
bloc and the dialogue committee. This is in addition to the 
coalition and YSP initiative which proposes the formation of a 
national salvation government reflecting national unity and 
broad participation to reconstruct the homeland on the basis of 
democracy as a durable option from which there should be no 
retreat. 
  The agreement emphasized commitment to the pledge and accord 
agreement and continued action to implement it. It also 
stressed the irreversible commitment of the signatory parties to 
democracy built on multipartyism and the alternation of [word 
indistinct] of authority. 
  The agreement also pledged to eliminate all manifestations 
of 
totalitarian rule or control of the instruments of power by an 
individual, party, or group anywhere in Yemen. Opportunities 
should be provided equally for political action and all 
patriotic and capable cadres should be involved in all fields 
and at all levels, regardless of their party or regional 
affiliation. 
  The document affirms that the homeland belongs to all and 
the 
responsibility for its protection and defense and the security 
of its citizens falls on all. The parties pledged themselves to 
work for like-mindedness through equal communication and 
balancing of interests between groups and governorates and the 
rejection of all attempts to sow hatred, malice, and supremacy. 
They also confirmed their rejection of warmongers, division, 
and secession. They condemned the stubbornness against stopping 
the [word indistinct] massacres. They agreed to set up a joint 
mechanism to lead, manage, and supervise all affairs, relations, 
and activities [word indistinct] to attain a government of 
national salvation which will implement the pledge and accord 
document. 
  The agreement on principles for national salvation was 
signed 
by the Nasirist Popular Organization, the League of the Sons of 
Yemen, the Union of Popular Forces, the Unionist Patriotic 
Alliance, the Party of Right, and the YSP. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice president of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP, made a 
speech in which he stressed that the meeting must be considered 
a historic step for Yemen and that Yemenis would never accept 
being silenced by artillery shells. 
  He said the principles of national salvation were a loud 
national cry emanating from a courageous patriotic stand and 
democratic spirit and [words indistinct] to continue the 
reconstruction of the homeland in a peaceful and democratic 
manner. He stressed that the YSP supported all the other 
parties to save the country from the catastrophe imposed on it 
by a small group in Yemen. He pointed out that such 
circumstances as these (?called) for the strengthening of 
relations and development of our capabilities which also creates 
sufficient [word indistinct] for better national action. The 
aim of all this is sincere work for God, the homeland, and man. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid asked for the [word indistinct] 
continually and said: We shall do all within our power with our 
brothers, the party leaders. We are confident that this step 
represents a stand suitable for all democratic citizens and 
gives hope to the sons of our people that democracy is not mere 
talk or articles in newspapers, but it is also facing 
difficulties and challenges to build the homeland. Brother 
al-Bid pointed out that there were the supremacist views of some 
who consider others as little persons. We say that the small 
man can become bigger and that the future is his. The future is 
for the young, because we always say the future belongs to the 
youth. He said: Whatever steps we have taken we have now 
reached one position, and we hope that all shall be in the 
national salvation. All questions by journalists were answered 
in the conference.

  [Text] Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], made a telephone call to Isayas Afwerki, 
the president of the State of Eritrea. During the call he 
informed him about the current situation in our country in the 
light of the barbaric attack launched by the al-Ahmar gang 
against the Yemeni people. He also informed him about the 
contents of the peace initiative presented by the politburo of 
the YSP to come out of the current crisis and (?rid off) our 
Yemeni people more catastrophes and destruction. 
  The president of Eritrea, for his part, warned against the 
danger of the current situations in Yemen and negative effects 
of the current war on the present and future of the Yemeni 
people. He affirmed Eritrea's rejection of settling the crisis 
by military options. Afwerki called for the necessity of 
responding to all peace initiatives concerning the Yemeni crisis 
and immediate cease- fire and resort to the political dialogue 
as the best way to settle the current political crisis and 
(?ridding) Yemen of more destruction and to spare the blood of 
the Yemenis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni "Prime Minister" Haydar Abu-Bakr </F>
al-'Attas by Hanan al-Badri in Washington; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Badri] What is your reaction to the 
decision dismissing you from the post of prime minister, and 
what are the constitutional repercussions as far as the 
continuation of the government is concerned? 
  [Al-'Attas] The dismissal decision was unconstitutional and 
illegitimate. It was actually a suspension not a dismissal 
because only the House of Representatives has the right to 
withdraw confidence from the cabinet. Withdrawal of confidence 
would mean formation of a new cabinet but, to avoid that 
dilemma, they played tricks to circumvent legitimacy and the 
Constitution. I say that the suspension decision means nothing 
at all. 
  [Al-Badri] How do you assess the chances of settling the 
crisis, bearing in mind current developments, the Arab mediation 
attempts, and the ideas proposed by some Yemeni figures for 
ending the fighting and starting a dialogue? 
  [Al-'Attas] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has always 
supported dialogue as the ideal way of tackling the problems 
facing Yemen's unity since its birth. We made great efforts 
over the past years. That resulted in the national dialogue and 
we all agreed that obstinacy only weakens Yemen. I support any 
initiatives calling for a cease-fire. 
  [Al-Badri] You personally and the YSP stand accused of 
seeking secession and receiving foreign aid to help you achieve 
secession. 
  [Al-'Attas] That [sounds like] the same old broken record. 
These accusations are a kind of ideological terrorism which is 
meaningless. The YSP advocates true unity with the exercise of 
democracy and under which the tribe-state link would end and the 
militarization of the regime would end. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Badri] Do you believe that the southern and northern 
leaderships can afford the military confrontation, considering 
their difficult economic conditions at present? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yemen needs every penny for development but this 
war was imposed on us by the military clique in Sanaa. 
  [Al-Badri] So you agree on the question of accepting foreign 
aid? 
  [Al-'Attas] Not at all. I am not discussing that now. Some 
states are providing material and human aid for the regime in 
Sanaa, such as Sudan which came into the picture when some 
Sudanese were arrested during the crisis, and Iraq which has 
also come into the picture. 
  [Al-Badri] Do you believe it is possible to work in 
accordance with the Pledge and Accord document? 
  [Al-'Attas] The Pledge and Accord Document was the only way 
out of Yemen's crisis. It provided a launching pad for a 
realistic way of tackling current problems and for an approach 
to the future with the aim of building a modern Yemeni state and 
a decentralized system, but Sanaa's rejection of that document 
has been perfectly clear from the first day. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Badri] The United States is still cautious about the 
current situation in Yemen. What is the truth about your 
contacts with the State Department and especially with Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau? 
  [Al-'Attas] Pelletreau contacted me from Washington when 
the attack on the 3d Brigade began and he expressed U.S. 
resentment of the action of the government in Sanaa. 
Regrettably, that attack on the 3d Brigade in 'Imran on 27 April 
was a result of a speech on the same day by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih in which he declared war, and the situation 
erupted despite the YSP's self-restraint. 
  Yes, my contacts with the U.S. State Department are 
continuing. The U.S. position is clear. They are against the 
war and they are trying, along with all the Arab brothers, to 
put pressure on Sanaa to stop the war and to resort to political 
dialogue. 
  [Al-Badri] Who is responsible for opening a new front in Bab 
el Mandeb? 
  [Al-'Attas] Aden did not open a front in Bab el Mandeb. 
Sanaa did. 
  [Al-Badri] Do you still hope for the success of diplomatic 
efforts to stop the fighting? 
  [Al-'Attas] I am very optimistic that the efforts of Egypt, 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, 
and the Arab League states and also U.S. efforts will produce 
results toward stopping the fighting so that the Yemeni 
leadership in Sanaa will return to its senses and make the brave 
decision of ending the war and returning to dialogue, because 
war means more Yemeni fragmentation. 
  [Al-Badri] [House of Representatives Speaker] Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar has accused 'Ali Salim al-Bid of mutiny. 
Planning Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani says that he sees 
nothing wrong with fighting. Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah has stated that they will put down the mutiny in a 
matter of hours. What is your comment? 
  [Al-'Attas] It is ridiculous that those three should come 
together and reach conclusions denoting ignorance of the facts 
about Yemen. The YSP is a part of the regime and it is an 
effective and essential partner, but it seems that the mentality 
of those people reflects a policy of annexation. As regards 
al-Iryani's statement, it is, like his previous statements, 
self-contradictory. 
  [Al-Badri] How do you interpret the conflicting statements 
of the Yemen capital? 
  [Al-'Attas] It has declared an unjust war and is trying to 
conceal its real objectives. We are clear and they are lying. 
The proof is the arrest campaign against all Yemeni patriotic 
figures who reject the war, which reflects Sanaa's military 
mentality. 
  [Al-Badri] The appointment of a new defense minister has 
been announced and it has been said that Sanaa's aim was to 
weaken the southern side. 
  [Al-'Attas] That too, regrettably, is another one of their 
stupid mistakes. They just do not understand Yemen's situation 
and circumstances. 
  [Al-Badri] Have you obtained American assurances or promises 
to settle the crisis, even militarily if necessary? 
  [Al-'Attas] The Americans are for an end to the war. I will 
be holding contacts with them in the next few days with the aim 
of reactivating the U.S. position in the direction of stopping 
the war, in cooperation with the Arab brothers. 
  [Al-Badri] Is it just a coincidence that you are outside 
Yemen now and were outside Yemen when the January 1986 incidents 
broke out? 
  [Al-'Attas] The circumstances are different. In January 
1986 I was on an official visit abroad. Now the reason is that 
I have had a health problem. I contributed to the work of the 
National Dialogue Committee despite the fact that I was in 
severe pain. The treatment for pain in the spine was started in 
Sanaa at the hands of Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Khalidi. I forced 
myself to take part in the cabinet meetings but then the 
deterioration in my condition compelled me to take the doctors' 
advice. I had to go abroad for treatment. I left Aden on 12 
April, 15 days before the president's ill-omened speech. 
  [Al-Badri] So how do you envisage your return to Yemen, and 
when? 
  [Al-'Attas] I will return to Yemen as soon as my treatment 
is completed. I am now recovering and, God willing, I will 
return soon to participate with the brothers in solving the 
problems facing Yemen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Ali Nasir Denies Alignment With </F>
'Ali Salih and Considers His Supporters' Acceptance of Posts To 
Be a Personal Decision"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The former (south) 
Yemeni President ['Ali Nasir Muhammad] has denied any connection 
with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's recent decisions in Sanaa 
appointing a new defense minister and a new naval forces 
commander, both from the military commands which had seceded 
with 'Ali Nasir from the regime which ruled south Yemen before 
the unity, in the 13 January 1986 incidents. He said that 'Ali 
Nasir is "for national unity and Yemeni unity." 
  This came in an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT from his residence in Damascus, reacting to Yemeni and 
Arab claims that the appointment of Staff Brigadier General 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur as defense minister after Sanaa's dismissal 
of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, 
who belongs to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and the 
appointment of Colonel Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Hasani as naval forces 
commander, were made in the context of a new alliance between 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Nasir to strike at the YSP in the 
south by using southern elements. 
  'Ali Nasir wondered why these speculations were made now and 
why there were no speculations about coordination between him 
and the YSP when 10 men formerly loyal to him joined the party a 
few weeks ago. Ten other supporters of 'Ali Nasir, he said, are 
members of General People's Congress [GPC] leaderships. He said 
that the GPC and the YSP had "shared power, wealth, and the band 
[al-zumrah]." 
  It is worth noting that, during the 1986 incidents, the wing 
loyal to 'Ali Nasir was called the "band" and the wing including 
the current YSP leaders was known as the "clique" [al-Tughmah]. 
The sides called each other by these names. 
  The former president said that acceptance of an appointment 
to any post in the Yemeni state is a personal decision by the 
individual concerned. "When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid joined hands against us, we dissolved our own party." He 
stressed that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid are 
responsible for what is taking place in Yemen." 
  He stressed that a distinction should be made between the 
position he insists upon, meaning that he "only supports Yemen's 
unity and is not aligned with any other party," and the 
positions of others "who are divided between the YSP and the GPC 
as it has become a matter of personal choice" since the latter 
part of 1989 when serious preparations began for Yemen's unity. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also obtained a statement issued by 
'Ali Nasir saying that he is "deeply pained by what is going on 
in Yemen, the war and the infighting to the detriment of 
national unity and Yemeni unity, destroying the Yemeni people's 
achievements for which the people struggled for over 30 years." 
  He reaffirmed his support for the efforts made for the 
preservation of unity and the settlement of disputes and 
political conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means. He has 
done and continues to do everything in his power to settle the 
dispute between the two sides through a number of initiatives 
this year and last year. He had earlier warned and expressed 
fear that the differences and conflicts between the three 
members of the ruling coalition could develop into a fire that 
would burn the unity. 
  He added that "any efforts made or solutions proposed must 
be 
based on the preservation of Yemen's unity, not on a return to 
the borders which existed before 22 May 1990." 
  He also announced that he is "holding consultations with 
some 
Yemeni figures who have not been involved in the conflict with a 
view to a new initiative for the settlement of the Yemeni 
crisis."

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram and Ibrahim Humaydi: "Conflicting </F>
Information About al-Dali'; Eight-Point Socialist Party 
Initiative"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Damascus, London, AL-HAYAH -- There were 
conflicting reports about the fate of al-Dali' yesterday. Sanaa 
stressed that its forces had captured the city and opened a new 
front in Shabwah Governorate, and that its forces were advancing 
in the Bab el Mandeb area with a view to encircling Aden from 
various directions. 
  But the Socialist Party completely denied the capture of 
al-Dali', a stronghold for a large number of southern army 
commanders. The party yesterday presented a political 
initiative which included the following: 
  1. an immediate halt to the war; 
  2. the formation of a national salvation government to 
eliminate the effects of the war; 
  3. measures to safeguard what is left of the Armed Forces, 
reorganize and regroup them, disengage the warring forces, and 
withdraw attacking forces to their positions before the war; 
  4. measures to safeguard citizens' lives and property, 
fairly 
compensate those harmed by the war, and consider victims of the 
war -- military and civilians -- martyrs. 
  5. the release of military and political prisoners; no 
arrest, pursuit, or torture of any political or military 
elements; measures to prevent the looting of citizens' property; 
and the return of looted property to the owners, or compensation; 
  6. no backtracking on the democratic option and political 
pluralism, and recognition of the parties' right to engage in 
political action in accordance with the Constitution and the law; 
  7. no backtracking on implementation of the Pledge and 
Accord 
Document. 
  8. action by the national salvation government to 
investigate 
who caused the war, with the conclusions to be announced to the 
people. 
  In Damascus, former [South] Yemen President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad has told AL-HAYAH that he met yesterday with Yemeni 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah and Oil Minister Salih 
Abu-Bakr Bin Husaynun. Both had met with President Hafiz 
al-Asad and he had asked them to work to halt "aerial 
bombardment involving scud missile strikes against cities." 
  'Ali Nasir added that he had discussed with them "the latest 
developments in the military and political situation in the 
country. And they spoke with me about their contacts with Arab 
leaders" during their tour of a number of Arab states. 
  The former Yemeni president pointed out that he had agreed 
with a number of "important" Yemeni figures to launch an 
initiative guaranteeing "a cease-fire and a swift solution to 
the crisis." 
  He added that the initiative is based on a number of "clear 
points" aimed at finding a way out of the current situation. 
However, he declined to talk about these points in detail, "in 
order to ensure its success, as we will be moving to Yemen after 
the contacts." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Commenting on a news agency report on an intiative 
by the Political Bureau of the Socialist Party to halt the 
fighting, a responsible official source said this proposal is 
only one of a host of false statements designed to mislead world 
public opinion, just as the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] has 
been doing since the fabrication of the crisis on 19 August 
1993. It began the crisis with its dialogue among the 
government coalition leadership, down to the points declared by 
the Socialist Party as a condition for the termination of the 
fabricated crisis. It continued its policy after the issue was 
referred to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and after 
the pledge and accord document was prepared as it tried to foil 
the efforts put into this document by igniting the military 
situation in Abyan Governorate on the eve of its signing, 20 
February. 
  The latest [as heard] Socialist Party lie was its disavowal 
of what was stated in the first part of the military section of 
the pledge and accord document. That exposed disavowal was 
accompanied by a serious escalation in the military situation 
and the kindling of war on Wednesday, 4 May. The source said 
the secessionist gang in the Socialist Party is responsible for 
starting and continuing the fighting and that the proper way out 
of the present situation is the Socialist Party's abidance by 
the following: 
  1. Acceptance of constitutional legitimacy and its 
legislative and executive institutions. 
  2. Prevention of the gang of rebellion and secession in the 
Socialist Party leadership from issuing orders to the units 
under its control. 
  3. Subjection of these units to the constitutional 
institutions and legitimate leadership elected by them. 
  The source said he hoped that the Socialist Party leaders 
who 
were not dragged into the schemes of the gang of rebellion and 
secession will shoulder their responsibility and deter this 
gang, which lost its party legitimacy after igniting the 
military situation and insisting on the continuation of fighting 
in implementation of its secessionist plan, which seeks to 
fragment the homeland.

  [Text] The Yemeni ulema have condemned the barbaric 
practices of the gangs of apostasy and secession in the 
Socialist Party, including their firing of internationally 
prohibited long-range missiles at populated areas in the capital 
of unity, other governorates, and secure cities and villages. 
They strongly denounced such acts by the Socialist Party war 
criminals, which have caused the death of many women, children, 
and elderly people. This came in a statement issued by the 
Yemen Ulema Society. 
  The statement said that fighting against the secessionist, 
rebellious elements in the Socialist Party leadership is 
legitimate because it seeks to eradicate sedition, protect 
religion against the advocates of apostasy and secession, and 
avert the dangers posed to the people and the country. God 
says: And fight them on until there is no more tumult or 
oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God. 
[Koranic verse] 
  The ulema praised the heroic stands of the Army and Security 
Forces men, who are resolutely fighting the forces of evil and 
sedition and the advocates of secession and division, scoring 
great victories by depending on God and holding out in the 
fighting arenas. The ulema appealed to all our Yemeni people to 
support our Armed and Security Forces, confront the rumor 
mongers, and report any attempt to disturb security. The ulema 
supported the wise and sound steps taken by the Presidential 
Council, the House of Representatives, and the Council of 
Ministers to deal with the situation and destroy the dangers of 
sedition and its perpetrators. They stressed their rejection of 
any interference. 
  The ulema concluded their statement by urging our people to 
sincerely beseech Almighty God in their prayers to aid our 
valiant soldiers and grant them victory. 
  God says: Already has Our Word been passed before this to 
Our Servants sent by Us, that they would certainly be assisted, 
and that Our forces,-they surely must conquer. [Koranic verse]

  [Text] The Executive Committee of the League of the Sons of 
Yemen Party [LSYP] has condemned any attempt to depart from the 
principles of Yemeni unity, the Republic of Yemen, the 
democratic gains, the political pluralism, the multiparty 
system, and the constitutional legitimacy, which is represented 
by the Presidential Council that was elected by the elected 
legislative authority. The party views such a departure as a 
departure from the Yemeni people's consensus and will. 
  The statement issued by the committee today asserts that the 
LSYP adheres to the Yemeni unity, views it as a destiny, and 
believes in democracy, political pluralism, the multiparty 
system, and constitutional legitimacy, which was established by 
the Yemeni people's consensus and in light of the general 
elections that were held on 27 April before the eyes of the 
entire world, including all the fraternal Arab countries. 
  The statement expresses the Executive Committee's rejection 
of any statement, issued in the name of the league without its 
approval, and which conflicts with the party's positions stated 
in this statement. It also stresses that assigning certain 
tasks by the party to its representatives from the national 
opposition bloc is temporary and not permanent.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 17 (AFP)--Yemen's oil sector, its 
only way out of poverty, could become the latest victim of the 
civil war as northern troops appear to set their sights on major 
fields in their push south. 
  But oil analysts in the region believe a disruption of 
Yemen's crude supplies would not have a major impact on the oil 
market given its relatively small exports and lower world demand 
in the second and third quarters. 
  "A loss of around 250,000 barrels per day will not jolt a 
market already awash with crude," an expert said. "Even if the 
market felt the loss, it could be more than offset by 
neighbouring Gulf oil-producers." 
  In some of the latest fighting, northern troops loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have said they were pushing to 
capture the southern province of Shabwah, where Yemen's main 
oilfields are located. 
  Diplomats said a confrontation in the area, 300 kilometres 
(185 miles) northeast of Aden, could damage oil facilities and 
disrupt crude exports as most of them come from Shabwah. 
  "I don't think capturing the oilfields is easy. It could be 
very costly for Yemen as the fields would not be spared in the 
fighting," one diplomat said. 
  Western sources in the southern port city of Aden said 
Monday 
that the Canadian firm Canoxy, which has been operating in Yemen 
for five years, had suspended operations in al-Masilah. 
  They said tankers had stopped loading from the southeastern 
al-Mukalla terminal, where the al-Masilah crude arrives by 
pipeline, because of higher insurance premiums. 
  However, Yemen's oil facilities in the south have not been 
damaged by the fighting, the sources said. 
  According to independent industry estimates, the Shabwah and 
al- Masilah fields produce around 140,000 barrels per day (bpd), 
accounting for almost all crude output in the south. 
  Another 195,000 bpd come from Ma'rib fields in the north. 
  Yemen's oil exports have steadily grown over the past years 
as the country at the tip of Arabian Peninsula pressed ahead 
with exploration and development of its fields. 
  From an average 100,000 bpd in 1988, oil exports increased 
to 
130,000 bpd in 1992 and 170,000 bpd in 1993. 
  Before the civil war erupted on May 5, they were projected 
to 
exceed 250,000 bpd in 1994 as the French Total and other 
international oil companies embarked on plans to develop their 
fields. 
  "Such plans mean oil production could exceed 400,000 bpd in 
1994 and 500,000 bpd in 1995," a Gulf-based oil executive said. 
"But this will not be possible if the war spreads to the oil 
areas. On the contrary." 
  Yemen's crude reserves are estimated at four billion barrels 
but the figure is expected to rise as the more than 20 Arab and 
foreign companies operating in both sectors have not yet covered 
all areas. 
  Major discoveries have also boosted Yemen's gas reserves 
from 
198 billion cubic metres (6.6 trillion cubic feet) in 1990 to 
362 billion cubic metres (12 trillion cubic feet) in 1993, 
according to official Arab figures. 
  After the north and south merged in May 1990, their leaders 
promised to use the growing oil wealth to raise living standards 
and tackle economic problems caused by a debt of around 6.5 
billion dollars, high inflation rates and unemployment, slow 
growth and deficits in the budget and balance of payments. 
  "Oil is Yemen's only hope for the time being to ease its 
economic difficulties," a Gulf-based Arab diplomat said. 
  "Yemen is not like Kuwait, which had massive investments 
abroad" during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, he said. "Damage to 
its oil sector would mean serious economic deterioration, and 
recovery could become more remote."
