  [Excerpts] Certain foreign media organizations have 
frequently fabricated deceptive news reports and repeated 
allegations that cast doubts on the victories of the Armed 
Forces defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy against the 
units controlled by the gang of apostasy and secession. 
  The objective of this cheap, mercenary propaganda circulated 
by the enemies of the Yemeni people -- who believe in their 
unity and rally behind their legitimate leadership -- is to 
trespass on the psychological state of the entire Yemeni people. 
  However, our people, who can sense the hostility of the 
reports circulated by some foreign media, know very well that 
these reports lack credibility and contribute to the 
psychological war the gang of apostasy and session is waging to 
hide facts and deceive people into believing it is still 
powerful and able to reinstate its control of the homeland. 
But, the people are aware. They know the objective behind 
these fabricated news reports circulated by some foreign media 
agencies about the illusionary victories of the gang of apostasy 
and secession. This protects them from this filthy 
psychological war. [passage omitted] 
  Needless to say, our Armed Forces, who are fighting battles 
for the sake of unity and in defense of Constitutional 
legitimacy, know the intent of broadcasting such deceptive and 
fabricated reports by the foreign news media. 
  First, the Armed Forces are living the battles and know the 
truth about their achievements in the military operations they 
are fighting in various areas. Second, they are confident of 
their combat ability and their resources of weapons, equipment, 
and ammunition. Third, they believe in the great cause they are 
fighting for, that is, the unity that is the most precious 
national achievement of our people. Fourth, our Armed Forces, 
who are defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, 
understand very well the evil intentions of some of the foreign 
media who are repeating the lies and deception circulated by the 
media of the gang of apostasy and secession. And, above all, 
our Armed Forces are certain that the masses of the people are 
standing behind them, supporting them, and providing them with 
everything that will help them achieve victory and soon decide 
the battles against the forces of apostasy and secession, whose 
inevitable end is known in advance. 
  In a nutshell, we say: The Yemeni people have grown up. 
They have enough awareness and faith to protect them against 
the campaigns of deception, regardless of their nature or 
source. The Armed Forces, who are protecting unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy, have not and will not be affected by 
the cheap psychological war. They know themselves. They know 
their great goal is to triumph over the forces of apostasy and 
secession, the enemies of the people and their unity.

  [Text] O sons of our great people in beloved Aden, in 
(?the plains of) al-Hawtah, in the villages and [words 
indistinct], and in all areas of Yemen: The rumors circulated 
by the trumpeting dwarfs of the gang of apostasy and secession 
about your Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, are 
stained with a sense of aggressive and regional bias that 
reflects the structure of that gang. They have been violating 
the will of the people and their values throughout the era in 
which they were in control. They, as well our people, realize 
the extent of the tolerance, brotherhood, and generosity 
displayed by the forces of unity and legitimacy toward the 
deceived ones who directed their weapons against unity and 
legitimacy. 
  Can our people believe these degenerate rumors after seeing 
with their own eyes the tolerance of the leader president in 
'Imran and the tolerance of our forces, the forces of unity, in 
al-Dali', Musaymir, Mukayras, Abyan, and (?Rassal). 
  With all honesty and sincerity, we stress that the forces of 
unity and legitimacy view as equal all citizens of Yemen. They 
have always been, and will remain, the protectors of the 
citizens and their property and honor, and the protectors of the 
people's sacred goal in defending unity and Constitutional 
legitimacy.

  [Text] The army of constitutional legitimacy and the forces 
of unity and democracy are continuing their triumphant advance 
to destroy the gang of apostasy and secession and to uphold 
unity and the homeland. It is a great mission and objective 
sought by every zealous Yemeni citizen who believes in unity. 
Therefore, success has been a permanent companion of these 
forces in their triumphant unionist march. The misled elements 
in the Armed Forces under the hegemony of the gang of apostasy 
are confidently siding with the forces of legitimacy, ridding 
themselves of the hegemony of the gang of apostasy. They are 
sincerely and honestly joining the forces of unity in all 
fighting positions and all axes of the great unionist march. 
Similar to these unionist stands by the military, the 
civilians, too, take the initiative in welcoming the forces of 
legitimacy and unity and cooperating with them in their national 
unionist mission. They realize that they are forces of 
protection, salvation, legitimacy, security, and peace, and 
believe that they are forces seeking to entrench unity, support 
the pillars of democracy, uphold the word of the people, and rid 
them of the renegade gang under which they suffered bitterly. 
  The citizens have long suffered from the sins of this gang. 
Now they realize that the hour of salvation is coming and that 
the moment of liberation is imminent, God willing, through the 
determination of the free unionists. Accordingly, it is a 
foregone conclusion to tell all citizens in the operational 
sectors and to all unionists in the Armed Forces axes: These 
are your forces which express your ambitions, achieve your 
aspirations, work for your salvation, and watch over you and 
your interests. They protect you from the evil of the renegade 
gang and tyranny. They are your guarantee for a true unionist 
future, a just and democratic society, and a free and dignified 
life. They are the vanguards of love and peace, harbingers of 
concord and order, protectors of unity and democracy, carriers 
of the banner of renaissance and development, and guardians of 
right and legitimacy. Therefore, the strongholds and 
fortifications of apostasy and secession in all positions and 
axes are collapsing daily in front of their unionist march 
everywhere. 
  The successes scored by these unionist forces give clear 
evidence that the forces of constitutional legitimacy and the 
armies of unity and democracy represent the hand of the divine 
power, which has ordained that the secessionist parasites be 
uprooted and the dens of the renegade gangs be destroyed. They 
express the popular will to destroy this gang, get rid of its 
evil, and destroy its conspiracy against the homeland, unity, 
and democracy. This gang wanted to obliterate others so that it 
could control everything and dominate all the people. 
Therefore, it had to be removed from the path of the people and 
erased from the history of the homeland after suffering from 
what it intended for the citizens. This renegade gang wanted to 
destroy democracy and foil unity, but God destroyed their 
pillars and made them taste grievous punishment. Their end is 
imminent, God willing.

  [Excerpt] At the Iraqi Mission in New York yesterday, 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz received a delegation of Arab 
and international figures participating in an international 
campaign against the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  During a reception held by the Iraqi Mission in the honor of 
the figures, the deputy prime minister reviewed Iraq's position, 
which sees the need for the Security Council to recognize the 
facts that are supported by UN circles in charge of implementing 
UN resolutions. 
  Tariq 'Aziz said Iraq has implemented a great deal of these 
resolutions, and it is now the turn of the Security Council to 
recognize these facts and consequently lift the unjust blockade 
imposed on Iraq. 
  The deputy prime minister said one member only; namely, the 
United States, is using its influence to prevent the 
implementation of Security Council resolutions. It thus 
represents the minority at the Security Council. 
  Tariq 'Aziz answered questions by several members of the 
delegation of international personalities on Iraq's relationship 
with the Security Council. [passage omitted]

  [Text] London, 16 May (INA) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister 
Mr. Tariq 'Aziz said political pressures imposed on the UN 
Special Committee and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] had prevented them from informing the Security Council of 
Iraq's compliance with Resolution 687. 
  In statements to the BBC correspondent in New York, Mr. 
'Aziz 
added that without those pressures, the Special Committee and 
the IAEA would have a long time before conveyed this view to the 
Security Council. 
  Mr. 'Aziz added that the political attitudes of France, 
Russia and China toward Iraq are clear and had acknowledged the 
realities concerning Iraq's application of the Security Council 
resolution. 
  Mr. 'Aziz pointed out that the United States and Britain 
maintain anti-Iraq political stances contributing not to 
acknowledge these realities. 
  Mr. 'Aziz said text of Resolution 687 is an important issue 
and is considered essential by the West and that is why the West 
made row when it thought that Iraq does not comply to the 
resolution articles but when it has become clear that Iraq is 
fully complying with the resolution, the West started to say 
that that is not important and such affair reflects a clear 
contradiction. 
  Mr. 'Aziz said we still say to the Security Council that it 
should respect its resolution otherwise this would harm the 
legal and moral credibility of its resolutions.

  [Text] Two Israelis -- a man and a woman -- were killed 
and another was seriously wounded in a terrorist attack near Bet 
Hagay, in the Hebron Hills, this morning. The seriously wounded 
man, a resident of Qiryat Arba', is being treated at the site of 
the incident. The names of the dead have not yet been announced. 
  As far as is known, the terrorists, driving in a Peugeot, 
overtook the Israelis' Fiat Uno and fired several rounds from an 
automatic weapon at the Israeli car . 
  Our correspondents Moti Amir and Aviv Bushinsky report that 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has closed off the area, set up 
roadblocks, and launched searches for the assailants. Military 
medical crews and three civilian ambulances from the adjoining 
settlements were summoned to the site.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a telephone call to Qol 
Yisra'el's Arabic-language Department, the Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam terrorist squad 
claimed responsibility for this morning's attack near Hebron. 
The callers gave details about the way the attack was 
perpetrated. Army forces, headed by Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commander in Judaea and Samaria, 
were rushed to the scene of the attack. Our correspondent Moti 
Amir reports that the vehicle in which the terrorists were 
traveling was found totally burned a short time ago in Hebron. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur said that extremists 
in 
the Palestinian camp want to torpedo the peace process but will 
have no choice but to enter into negotiations with us. Gur sent 
condolences to the families of the dead and wished the wounded 
woman a speedy recovery. The deputy minister is touring Israeli 
settlements in the Jericho area today. He passed through 
Jericho but did not stop there. 
  Reactions in the Knesset to the attack: The National 
Religious Party said this is merely the opening shot in a joint 
offensive by the PLO and the other terrorist organizations. 
Tzomet said it is additional proof that the actions of the 
Palestinians will force us into a bloody war. Our correspondent 
Hayim Hecht reports that Moledet said today's deaths are more on 
the list of Yitzhaq Rabin's war casualties.

<F P=106> [Report by Jack Katzenell] </F>
  [Text] Ministers learned about this morning's terrorist 
attack at Bet Hagay during the weekly cabinet session, which was 
held today instead of on Sunday. They expressed outrage at the 
attack. The information was still fragmentary, but the chief of 
the General Staff, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, gave a 
detailed report on yesterday's incident in Hebron. Some 
ministers criticized the Army for permitting the settlers to 
walk into downtown Hebron. 
  Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said these tours are never 
innocent; they are always provocative. We have to fight 
terrorism and provocation, he said, if we are to press forward 
with the peace process. Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir 
Tzaban said that if this artificial cult of old tombs is allowed 
to continue, there will be plenty of new tombs. Housing 
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer renewed his demand for the 
concentration of all the scattered groups of settlers in Hebron 
in one place, and Prime Minister Rabin said the action of the 
settlers yesterday was not justified. 
  The chief of staff rejected the ministers' criticisms of the 
Army. He said in allowing the settlers tour, the Army was only 
carrying out instructions of the government. On the basis of 
these instructions, settlers are permitted to walk from Qiryat 
Arba' into Hebron. This had always been permitted in the past, 
and the government had never adopted a decision to the contrary. 
  The prime minister did not report to the cabinet on his 
meeting with Warren Christopher last night. It was informal, he 
said, and the real talks will take place this evening. 
  The head of the Israeli team negotiating with Syria, 
Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, told Qol Yisra'el this morning he 
has the impression that the Syrians realize that time is running 
out and do wish to make progress, but are not certain how to go 
about it. In an hour's time, Secretary Christopher will be 
meeting Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. This evening, he will 
have another meeting with Prime Minister Rabin.

  [Text] In Hebron, 11 residents were wounded in incidents 
this afternoon. A group of settlers was pelted with rocks, and 
one of them opened fire. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports 
that, according to various reports, three Palestinian residents 
were apparently injured by the shooting. Another eight were 
injured when the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] moved in to put out 
riots which followed the shooting incident in Hebron. One of 
the wounded is in grave condition, two suffer medium wounds, and 
the rest were lightly wounded. 
  Representatives of the Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron arrived at the site of the incident and began collecting 
evidence from the Arab residents of Hebron. The Jews did not 
testify about the incident. Also, the IDF has not yet detained 
any settler for questioning, but an IDF unit is on its way to 
the Shavey Hevron Yeshiva to investigate which of the settlers 
fired the shots.

  [Text] The security forces are investigating the incident 
in which 19 Arab residents and three border policemen were 
injured in Hebron this afternoon. The incident started when 
Jewish residents were walking through Policeman's Square in town 
and came under a hail of rocks. They shot at the stone 
throwers, wounding nine Arabs. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
patrols that arrived at the site were also pelted with rocks. 
They were forced to shoot in an attempt to disperse the stone 
throwers, and apparently wounded 10 residents. The IDF detained 
two yeshiva students from the region for questioning about the 
shooting. The city of Hebron was declared closed military zone.

  [Text] Officers from Jericho's Palestinian police force 
said there were several stone-throwing incidents today and that 
they immediately returned the situation to normal quiet, our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  The Jericho police commander complained to the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] commander in the Jericho area that armed people 
entered the town's synagogue. The IDF representative retorted 
that under the agreement with the PLO, Israelis are permitted to 
enter the synagogue armed. 
  Our correspondent Gil Litman reports from Jericho's ancient 
synagogue that 50 students of the yeshiva which had operated 
there, led by Knesset Member Hanan Ben-Porat, and including 
several members of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, studied there at noon today. Porat 
said he would try to make sure that the students remained there 
overnight.

  [Text] In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers shot and 
wounded two Palestinians who opened fire on them from a truck 
near the settlement Morag. There were no Israeli casualties. 
Our reporter Alan Ben-'Ami says the gunmen got away and a joint 
Israeli-Palestinian team arrived on the scene to investigate. 
  Meanwhile, the Israeli pullout from Gaza is nearly complete. 
The Civil Administration building was turned over to the 
Palestinians this afternoon at a ceremony attended by Brigadier 
General David Gazit, Israel's head of the Civil Administration 
in the strip. Four hundred more Palestinian policemen are due 
to arrive in the Gaza Strip from Egypt today.

  [Text] As part of the transfer of Civil Administration 
powers to the PLO in Gaza, the Palestinians received today the 
center of control over government offices in Gaza Strip and 
independent apparatuses which serve, among other things, the 
Interior and Agriculture Ministries. 
  The commander of the computer unit, Major Yoram Baraq, 
believes that unless they are helped by Israel, the Palestinians 
will have many problems operating the systems, although during 
the overlap period they have acquired a reasonable basis to 
begin working. 
  Our correspondent Karmela Menashe notes that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] has, in fact, evacuated the entire Gaza Strip, 
except for the brigade headquarters, the governor's house, and 
several other small installments. The ceremony of handing 
control of the Gaza Strip over to the Palestinians is due to 
take place tomorrow at the Qatif Bloc. 
  Brigadier General Dubi Gazit, Head of the Civil 
Administration in the Gaza Strip, said after the PLO accept the 
authority there is no reason they would not to be able to manage 
the administration themselves. If any problems should occur, 
they would be discussed by the regional committee on civilian 
affairs, he said.

<F P=106> [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen -- </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] [Rosen] It may well be that the basic problem is 
that al-Asad still believes he is being lied to. Several days 
ago, so we have learned, al-Asad asked UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali whether he can believe the Israelis. 
Butrus-Ghali told him that yes, he can -- at least according to 
what he later told Israeli elements. 
  Warren Christopher arrived in Damascus yesterday after 
making 
an effort to lower everybody's expectations. Yet, anyone who 
examines his reservation for King David Hotel rooms will find 
signs of optimism. The rooms are booked until the morning of 19 
May, which means that this time the secretary plans a double 
Damascus-Jerusalem trip. This is Christopher's third shuttle 
mission to the region. It took James Baker, his predecessor, 
seven such tours to convene the Madrid conference. But, 
Christopher is not given too much credit. They say that he is 
not a middleman but a mailman. He lacks initiatives and ideas, 
and often falls asleep during discussions. 
  [Eytan Bentzur, deputy Foreign Ministry director general] I 
certainly do not share this criticism. I believe it is not 
warranted. I believe that the secretary and the team that 
accompanies him make a skilled and very experienced team which 
makes a real contribution to the process. 
  [Rosen] Baker sewed the seeds; Christopher is yet to reap 
the fruit, but his caution is a matter of policy, and does not 
only correspond with his personal character. Eytan Bentzur says 
that Madrid was an entirely different ball game, and that 
Baker's disposition could have caused a crisis here at this time. 
  [Bentzur] He believes that the process of negotiations will 
develop gradually; that his role is to bring the stands closer 
together, make them clearer and, when the time comes, perhaps to 
bridge the gaps between the stands. 
  [Rosen] Al-Asad is very disappointed and mad at the 
Americans. They do not apply enough pressure on Israel. And, 
what is worse, they do not make the bilateral moves toward Syria 
and are not removing it from the list of countries which sponsor 
terror and drug trade. This, perhaps, explains the unscheduled 
meeting Christopher, who was on his way to the airport, held 
this morning with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. 
  Jerusalem does not yet know whether Washington will accept 
the Israeli security demands, not to mention whether Washington 
will skip summer vacation to conduct negotiations. The key, 
however, is still in the hands of Hafiz al-Asad. His agreement 
for the convention in Washington of teams of military experts to 
discuss security arrangements will be considered a great 
achievement. If al-Asad makes such a move, Rabin may follow it 
with a very meaningful statement on, for example, eliminating 
the Golan Law; recognizing Syria's demand for sovereignty over 
the Golan Heights; or mentioning the government resolution from 
June 1967 about a full withdrawal to the international borders, 
with a deliberately vague definition of the term international 
border. Rabin has recently rejected suggestions by senior 
Foreign Ministry officials to make such a statement at this 
time. If al-Asad moves forward, Rabin will be willing to 
favorably reconsider the suggestion.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Excerpt] For the first time since the beginning of the 
Israeli-Syrian negotiations, high-ranking political sources last 
night voiced "cautious optimism" concerning the contacts with 
Damascus. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived in 
Israel yesterday afternoon after a series of talks with 
President al-Asad and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' in 
Damascus, met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at his Jerusalem 
residence late last night. The meeting, which was attended by 
Dennis Ross and Professor Itamar Rabinovich, lasted about an 
hour and a half. 
  After the meeting, Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to 
the United States, said: "The negotiations held in Damascus 
should be viewed as a few more small steps at the start of a 
long trek. Further declarations were made and answers given in 
the course of Christopher's talks. The talks should be viewed 
in terms of protracted negotiations. Not every declaration or 
answer immediately creates a new reality." 
  Nevertheless, last night both American and Israeli sources 
were under the impression that practical Israeli-Syrian 
negotiations have been launched and that while the gaps between 
the parties' stands are very profound, Christopher sensed that 
the Syrian stand has shifted. 
  Last night, Christopher presented Rabin with detailed Syrian 
answers to the clarifications Israel had requested concerning 
the arrangement proposed by Syria. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporting on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT 
on 
17 May, political correspondent Shlomo Raz states that 
"Jerusalem primarily took note of the Syrian media reports, 
which are also being interpreted as an attempt to improve the 
atmosphere and not as actual progress in the negotiations. 
These include the TISHRIN report about withdrawal within a 
reasonable period and the AL-HAYAH report outlining five points 
of the Israeli-Syrian peace arrangement." Raz cites "a senior 
political source" as saying that the AL-HAYAH report "is 
inaccurate, because that is not what Warren Christopher brought 
back from Damascus, although it indicates a desire to improve 
the atmosphere." 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 17 May, in a report by 
political correspondent Aluf Ben on page A1, cites "a senior 
political element" as saying "last night" that "the Syrian 
replies addressed every component of the Israeli peace proposal: 
withdrawal, security arrangements, the substance of peace, the 
time factor, and the linkage between withdrawal and 
normalization. According to him, the answers were `low key'."]

  [Text] Labor ministers today decided to pass control of 
the Histadrut labor federation to Ramon's list in an orderly and 
dignified way. Contacts on this issue will commence on Tuesday 
[17 May]. In a meeting of Labor ministers today, Prime Minister 
Rabin said the transfer of power must be completed quickly in 
order to prevent a feeling of procrastination. Our party 
affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Minister Liba'i 
proposed to remove Hayim Haberfeld and Nisim Zvili from the 
negotiations team. Minister Qeysar reacted angrily to this 
proposal. Minister Ora Namir also said that Haberfeld should 
not conduct these negotiations. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer said the 
elections proved that the age of ideology is over, and the only 
thing which remains now is the media. Foreign Minister Peres 
said the elections do not merely constitute a defeat for the 
Labor Party, but also signal the end of the Histadrut.

<F P=106> [Report by Salahuddin Haider and Surender Valasai] </F>
  [Text] Karachi, May 14, A series of bomb blasts in two 
Karachi mosques and hnambargahs [shrines] shook the city on 
Saturday [14 May] morning. 
  In another incident of violence three persons, including a 
police constable, were killed in firing. 
  The bomb blasts in Masjikis and Imahagahs, just when Moharam 
is in the corner, are indicators of dreadful things to come. 
All this appeared to be a part of the design to ignite 
sectarian clashes in the city. 
  Who are the elements behind the sinister plan? The 
authorities must find the answer, and find it quickly. 
  Security agencies have been active in the city, each 
claiming 
that they have been more efficient than the other, in effects to 
restore law and order. But none of these agencies have a clue 
that who are the elements behind these blasts and what are their 
motives. 
  In fact, the police were surprisingly ignorant of the 
incidents, "We are not aware of such incidents. Reports 
appearing in the press are wrong" claimed a senior police 
officer. 
  Residents, however, said they heard the blasts in the small 
hours of Saturday. The explosions took place in Gulhan-e-Iqbal 
where the Janiat-Uloon-e-Taleemat-e-Islami was the target. A 
hand grenade was hurled at it. 
  In Gulshan-e-Iqhal, Block 4-A where most of the city 
journalists have their houses, the Masjid-e-Taqwa was the 
target. A bomb exploded in its courtyard. No injury was caused 
to anyone. The obvious exercise was to create a scare among 
residents. Syed Fariduddin, 35, District East President of the 
Sipah-e-Sababa, a religious organisation, deadly opposed to Shia 
community, was fired at. He received four bullets and was 
hospitalised. Simultaneously, agencies fed the newspaper with 
reports that secretarian clashes in Karachi and the rest of 
Sindh were imminent, and that a red alert had been sounded to 
all police and relevant establishments to deal with the 
situation. 
  In the second incident of violence in which three people 
were 
killed some unknown armed young men fired indiscriminately at 
two police constables Sultan Meumood and Badruzzaman at Alfalah 
society near Wireless gate. Sultan Ahmed was killed on the spot 
while his other colleague escaped unhurt. Both constables were 
returning after performing their guard duty at National Bank 
Branch in Alfalah.

  [Text] The prime minister said Pakistan will continue 
supporting the Kashmiris until they realize their right to 
self-determination. Speaking to newsmen in Islamabad yesterday 
evening, Benazir Bhutto said the Kashmir dispute is a vital 
element of Pakistan's foreign policy. She said Pakistan 
strongly believes that the struggle of the Kashmiris is 
legitimate and hence Pakistan should continue to support them 
diplomatically and politically. The prime minister said the 
basic objective of raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human 
Rights Commission in Geneva was to highlight it at the 
international level. She said its effects can be judged from 
the fact that during the Commission's session, there was some 
respite in Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir. India was 
constrained to discourage its 600,000 soldiers from committing 
human rights violations and to grant permission to the 
international human rights organizations and diplomats of 
Islamic Conference Organization. 
  Turning to the nuclear issue, Benazir Bhutto stated in 
clearcut terms that Pakistan will not sacrifice its peaceful 
nuclear program at any cost. She categorically stated that 
Pakistan is pursuing this policy after thinking about it fully, 
as it cannot sacrifice its knowledge and expertise in this vital 
field. She said it was India who violated the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty by exploding a nuclear devise. 
  Referring to Pakistan-U.S. relations, the prime minister 
said 
talks are being held in Washington on ways to strengthen the 
friendly ties between the two countries. Describing the 
Pressler Amendment as a hindrance to ties, she said her 
government's policy is to see that Pakistan does not come under 
any pressure due to this amendment. She said pressure should be 
exerted on India, who has violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 17 (AFP) -- Pakistan Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto has yielded to Moslem militants and agreed to 
introduce Islamic Sharia law in part of northern Pakistan 
following clashes with security forces Monday [16 May] in which 
10 people were killed. 
  The government issued a decree late Monday following the 
disturbances in Malakand region announcing the immediate 
introduction of the Sharia to replace the existing civil code. 
  Bhutto, 40, who favours a modern and liberal interpretation 
of Islam, ceded to a small clerical party, Tehrik-e-Nifaz Sharia 
(Movement for the Introduction of Sharia), which had mobilised 
tens of thousands of people behind its militant religious stand. 
  Malakand, in the northwest, is a rural and mountainous 
region 
of Pakistan, populated by Pashtuns, a heavily armed ethnic 
group, fiercely proud of its traditions and autonomy.

<F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan's decision to ease travel arrangements 
across the King Husayn Bridge was taken after the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel agreed to allow 
Palestinians who were residing in the territories on June 4, 
1967, a day before the six-day war broke out, to return 
gradually to the territories under Palestinian jurisdiction, 
Interior Minister Salamah Hammad said Saturday. 
  "Our policy in Jordan has always been that we are committed 
to the Palestinians' right of return," Mr. Hammad told a group 
of Jordanian journalists, adding that when the Kingdom was 
assured of this right, "we simplified the crossing procedures at 
the bridge while still maintaining our commitment to that right. 
  "Our principle of countering Israeli attempts to empty the 
territories of Palestinian citizens was finished with this 
signature (by the PLO and Israel)," he added. 
  Mr. Hammad said that initial statistics showed that movement 
across the bridge had already indicated a decrease in the 
number, by almost half, of Palestinians who cross the bridge 
into Jordan, an indication which he interpreted to mean that the 
measures did not backfire as was feared by some Jordanians. 
  Conceding that the PLO-Israel agreement will have to be 
implemented in stages and after tough negotiations between 
Israel and the PLO, and that Jordan cannot merely rely on 
Israeli good intentions, Mr. Hammad stressed that the "principle 
of return is there." 
  "The preliminary indications, until now, is that these 
measures have contributed to increase the return of Palestinians 
to the occupied territories and not the other way around," Mr. 
Hammad said. 
  Some Jordanian politicians and analysts have warned that 
facilitating the crossing into Jordan from the West Bank may 
encourage Palestinians living under occupation to flee to the 
Kingdom where they may later lose their right to return to their 
homeland. 
  The minister was careful to point out that these regulations 
will continue to be "updated and amended to go along with the 
developments across the bridge." 
  He said that if Jordan continues to receive guarantees that 
protect the Palestinians' rights of staying in their homeland, 
"Jordan may feel that there will be no need for the department 
of inspection and control." 
  The department was established in 1982 as the authority at 
the Ministry of Interior directly in charge of the affairs of 
West Bank citizens and those carrying family reunification 
papers for the occupied territories. 
  Mr. Hammad pointed out that the new crossing measures, 
issued 
at the instructions of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan 
when he met with the secretary-generals of the different 
ministries two weeks ago, are a mix of easing up of measures 
adopted in 1988, when Jordan severed legal and administrative 
ties with the West Bank, and others that were taken since then. 
  He said that one of the procedures that was stopped by the 
new regulations was taking travellers' documents at the bridge 
to make them visit the inspections and control department to 
follow up on their cases. 
  "We initially took these measures when Israel allowed only 
10,000 to 15,000 Palestinian labourers, out of around 120,000 to 
work in Israel," Mr. Hammad explained. 
  "Israel at that time started giving young Palestinians exit 
permits but after making them sign a commitment not to return 
for a number of years," Mr. Hammad said, pointing out that 
Jordan's measure at the time was to guard against Palestinian 
youth running away to better working conditions only to find 
that they had lost their right of return. 
  He said the Ministry of Interior had already prepared 
studies 
on ways to facilitate the crossing of the King Husayn Bridge in 
anticipation of any improvement on the Palestinian front. 
  "When His Royal Highness raised the issue with us we were 
prepared to take the necessary steps," Mr. Hammad said. 
  "We announced the easing up of procedures at the bridge but 
we continued to guard the principle that has always guided us 
and that is to protect the rights of the Palestinians," he said. 
"We want our procedures to be humane and civilised," he added. 
<H5>  Election Law </H5>
  Mr. Hammad told the group of Journalists that his ministry 
had prepared the "administrative and technical mechanism" for a 
new election law but had not yet prepared a draft for the 
division of voter districts or the number of parliamentary 
seats, which, he said, "will be determined by the final 
arrangements for civil districts." 
  "We do not know yet whether the Kingdom will be treated as 
one voting district or whether it will follow the division of 
civil districts," Mr. Hammad said. 
  He also said that anyone who enjoys a Jordanian nationality 
"will be allowed to vote regardless of his origin and whether he 
is residing in Jordan or outside." 
  In an answer to a specific question on whether Jordanian 
nationals who also carry Palestinian reunification papers--which 
amount to a residency in the occupied territories--will be 
allowed to vote in the next elections, Mr. Hammad stressed that 
those who "carry the Jordanian nationality will be able to vote 
regardless of where they reside and those in the West Bank are 
no exception if they carry the Jordanian nationality." 
  He pointed out that this excludes holders of the two-year 
passports since that passport is a travel document and not proof 
of nationality. 
  He said that the new "administrative and technical" 
amendments include allowing citizens to register according to 
their national numbers given to them by the Civil Service 
Commission and not by their family books as had been the 
practice in the 1989 elections. 
  An important amendment to the Elections Law, Mr. Hammad 
said, 
is that the voting and the vote count will be conducted at the 
same centre and ballots will not be moved to the governor's 
office to avoid "criticism or unfounded charges." 
  He said that the principle of finding a mechanism which will 
allow Jordanian expatriate communities to vote in their areas of 
residence is being studied, but that the final decision over 
"whether registration has to be made in Jordan or whether it can 
be done in Jordanian embassies outside has not been reached." 
  On his meeting he had with the heads of political parties in 
the Kingdom last Thursday, Mr. Hammad said that the two and a 
half hour encounter served to "strengthen the relationship 
between the Ministry of Interior and the secretary generals of 
political parties." 
  He said that some of the participants asked that the 
government "help allocate funds for the operations of political 
parties," while some others argued against the concept. 
  "I asked them to put their request in a memorandum signed by 
all of them and that I would carry their request to the 
government," Mr. Hammad said. 
  The minister also pledge to provide the political parties 
with any information they need on agreements signed by Jordan or 
protocols with other countries. 
  "Each party will appoint a representative who will stay in 
touch with the ministry over information requests," he said. 
  On requests for air time on Jordan Television or the 
inclusion of their papers' editorials on the "press briefs 
programme" carried on JTV, Mr. Hammad said that he explained 
that since the parties have their own newspapers they could work 
to "provide something different" in those papers since 
television time "would be completely taken up" if all 22 
political parties were vying for equal time. 
  He said that the secretary-generals complained about the 
small percentage of Jordanians who are willing to become members 
of political parties. "But I told them that this problem cannot 
be blamed on the government. Let them come up with something 
new and practical, and they will see better results." 
  On complaints that the government "has been intervening in 
the running of professional associations," Mr. Hammad said that 
he told them "that they are the ones interfering in the work of 
the professional associations by politicising bodies that should 
be working on improving conditions for their members." 
  On specific complaints of intervention in the associations, 
Mr. Hammad said, "I advised them that problems like this should 
be taken to courts where the law can be the decisive word."

  [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet 
affairs and information minister, has said that the Council of 
Ministers has decided to form a delegation of competent 
ministers to hold talks with the Palestinian side. He added 
that the talks will deal with the issues that should be dealt 
with now to organize trade transactions between Jordan and 
Palestine in light of two basic facts -- namely, the economic 
cooperation agreement, signed between Jordan and the Palestinian 
side on 17 January, and the developments in the Palestinian 
territories in Jericho and the Gaza Strip where new Palestinian 
institutions are being set up. These statements came in a 
debate, aired within the Jordanian Television program "Topical 
Issues," which also included PLO Economic Department Chief Ahmad 
Quray' and economic expert Dr. Taysir 'Abd-al-Jabir. Al- 'Anani 
added: Therefore, it was necessary to lay down a flexible and 
dynamic working plan that could deal with the swift changes 
taking place in the Palestinian territory. 
  Regarding Jordanian banks, trade exchange, and joint 
projects, Dr. al-'Anani said: The Palestinian side, led by 
Ahmad Quray', was positive because it wanted to go into the 
details after the stage in which principles were laid down, 
which we defined in the economic agreement. He added: We 
expect to agree on a mechanism through which people will be able 
to deal with each other. 
  Al-'Anani said: We must quickly define the mechanisms and 
issues with which we must begin and pay attention to. He noted 
that the Jordanian dinar is still the main currency in 
circulation in the West Bank. The minister added: We agreed 
with the Palestinian side on the method of dealing with the 
Jordanian dinar so as to maintain its value and purchasing power. 
  Ahmad Quray' touched on the dimensions of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, signed by the PLO and Israel in 
Paris recently. He said: This agreement deals with the major 
issues, such as currency, banks, trade, customs, direct and 
indirect taxes, tourism, insurance, agriculture, industry, and 
labor. He stressed that the choice of these topics was a 
Palestinian choice. 
  Quray' said: The most important strategy of talks with 
Israel was the restoration of the strategic Arab dimension to 
Palestinian relations, particularly with Jordan. He noted that 
immediately following the signing of the Declaration of 
Principles an economic agreement was ratified with sisterly 
Jordan in which trade between Palestine and Jordan was 
considered domestic. In other words, he added, no obstacles or 
boundaries stand in the way of this trade in light of the 
historical unity between the two countries in various fields. 
Ahmad Quray' said the issue of banks and currency was dealt 
with in this agreement, adding that this agreement helped us a 
great deal in the talks. 
  Dr. Taysir 'Abd-al-Jabir expressed his belief that the 
economic agreement between Jordan and Palestine would see great 
activity, even during the transitional period, adding that the 
size of trade exchange will reach 200 to 300 million dollars 
annually. Therefore, he said, the Palestinian self-rule area 
will have the largest trade transactions with Jordan. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Jabir said: Now that Jordanian banks have been 
allowed to operate in the West Bank and Gaza, these banks will 
be the basis of the banking system there and the Jordanian dinar 
will continue to be the main currency in circulation. He added 
that there will be other areas of cooperation between Jordan and 
Palestine, such as tourism, the creation of a free zone in the 
Jordan Valley, oil, energy, electricity linkup, services, and 
construction.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Prices took a beating and trading also shrank 
at the Amman Financial Market (AFM) last week mainly as a result 
of a sudden focus on the uncertainties of the economic agreement 
between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), 
brokers said Friday [13 May]. 
  Figures released by the AFM said the weekly turnover was 
JD8.9 million [Jordanian dinars] in five days of trading ending 
on Wednesday, reflecting a 5.3 per cent decline from last week's 
JD9.4 million in four days of trading, but a sharper dip of the 
average daily trading from JD2.4 million to JD1.8 million. 
  The general price index based on 60 major companies listed 
at 
the AFM dropped by 4.4 points to 156.4 points, reversing a trend 
that saw the index shooting up by more than six points during 
the week ending May 4 and several weeks of decline. The drop 
this week represented an overall 2.7 per cent plunge in prices. 
  The industrial sector accounted for JD5.3 million, or 61.8 
per cent of the week's turnover, followed by commercial banks 
with JD2.5 million, or 28.1 per cent, the services sector with 
JD800,000, or nine per cent, and insurance stock with JD100,000 
or 1.1 per cent. The separate sectoral indices showed that 
commercial bank stocks declined by 4.5 points, or 2.6 per cent, 
industrial stock by 4.5 points, or 3.1 per cent, services by 4.1 
points, or 2.7 per cent and insurance stock by 0.6 points, 0.4 
per cent. 
  Stocks of 92 companies were traded during the week, which 
saw 
3.5 million shares changing hands under 5,027 contracts, the AFM 
report said. As trading ended Wednesday, 10 of the companies 
showed gains, 75 losses and seven remained stable. 
  The market lists nearly 115 companies with a total market 
value equity of JD3.5 billion. 
  The regression in the market last week was mainly due to 
reports that the PLO wanted to "renegotiate" the Jan. 7 economic 
accord it signed with Jordan, brokers said. 
  Although PLO officials denied a new agreement was what they 
were after during the talks here that began on Tuesday, "the 
report nonetheless had its effect on the market psyche and the 
damage was done," said a broker. 
  Senior officials from [both] sides said last Wednesday that 
the meetings had led to agreement on mechanisms for implementing 
the Jan. 7 accord and there was no question of "replacing" the 
original accord. 
  "Now everyone is waiting to hear of the mechanisms and which 
sector of the economy is going to benefit," said the broker. 
"Industrial and construction companies with opportunities in the 
West Bank could be the main beneficiaries," added the broker, 
who preferred anonymity in line with standing AFM guidelines. 
  Analysts noted that investor spirit was high when the PLO 
and 
Jordan signed the agreement on Jan. 7, whose provisions could be 
interpreted as clearing the way for a strong Jordanian say in 
the banking and monetary affairs of the occupied territories in 
the interim autonomy envisaged under the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO 
declaration of principles. 
  However, the expectations were scrambled when the PLO and 
Israel signed an agreement in Paris last month, detailing a 
series of measures and actions to streamline the economic aspect 
of relations between the autonomous areas and Israel. 
  Some of the stipulations in that accord are seen as imposing 
severe restrictions on the scope of economic cooperation between 
Jordan and the autonomous areas. 
  "Public assurances by PLO officials that the spirit and 
principles of the Amman (Jordan-PLO) agreement remain very much 
valid have calmed nerves, but investors need tangible moves in 
realisation of those assurances," said the broker. 
  Furthermore, the five-day delay in Palestinian police 
entering autonomous Jericho was also influential in depressing 
prices and turnover at the AFM, brokers said. Some 400 
Palestinian policemen finally entered the occupied territories 
on Friday, with he rest of them poised to go in soon. 
  Another reason for the dip in turnover, brokers said, was 
the 
shift of capital away from the secondary market to the so-called 
parallel market where shares of new companies are subscribed to. 
  Such subscriptions need blocking of capital for a month, and 
as such funds available on he floor for trading in the 
established stocks have gone down since early this year, brokers 
said. 
  In general terms, brokers said, the market has suffered from 
investor hesitancy since the Jordanian-American standoff over 
the siege of al-'Aqabah since late March, when His majesty King 
Husayn said the Kingdom's return to the peace talks with Israel 
was contingent on an end to the damaging inspections of all 
Jordan-bound cargo in the Red Sea. 
  "That situation appears to be on its way to be resolved, but 
the ambiguity of the Jordan-PLO accord has replaced it in the 
market as one of the main negative considerations," said one 
broker. 
  Brokers generally shared an opinion that if the Jordan-PLO 
economic accord is clarified in all its aspects, then investors 
would be in a better position to judge for themselves which 
sector they could focus on and expect to reap gains. 
  "Prices and trading could shoot up in a matter of 24 to 48 
hours once investors shed their inhibitions," said the broker. 
"On the other hand, if the details of the accord are unclear, 
then there will [be] more uncertainties where the bulls will be 
at work."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Damascus Welcomes Washington Pledge </F>
To Achieve Progress in Negotiations This Year"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Syrian sources said 
yesterday that the U.S. Administration's announcement of its 
commitment to achieve "major progress" in the peace process this 
year "is encouraging and positive, and we hope it will find its 
way to real implementation." However, they pointed out that 
progress depends on "pressures which Washington should put on 
Tel Aviv to comply with the full withdrawal from the Golan." 
  On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the 
region in a few days, the sources said that it is designed to 
convey ideas between Tel Aviv and Damascus. The Yitzhaq Rabin 
government had "requested some time to consider the Syrian 
ideas." They added that "while Syria makes it a condition that 
Israeli forces withdraw from all the Golan before any discussion 
of peace or security, Israel gives priority to security and 
peace, saying that the withdrawal can take place later and in 
stages, with a view to testing Syria's good intentions." 
[passage omitted] 
  Syrian Foreign Ministry sources have told AL-HAYAH that 
pro-Israeli parties in the U.S. Administration are working to 
halt the development of bilateral relations between Damascus and 
Washington, and to keep Syria's name on the U.S. lists 
concerning "drugs, terrorism, and human rights." 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that these decisions conflict with 
previous U.S. positions, as the drugs list was issued days after 
a meeting between Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Robert Pelletreau, 
assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, 
during which they discussed this question in detail. The 
sources said that Pelletreau pledged to Syrian officials "to 
remove Syria's name from the list. But the reality was 
different -- which astonished Syrian officials." 
  A Syrian official has reiterated Damascus' demand that 
Israel 
withdraw from all the Golan Heights it has been occupying since 
the 1967 war as a condition for achieving any progress in the 
peace negotiations. He said: "Israel must announce its 
willingness to withdraw completely from the Golan and to 
dismantle the settlements before there can be any discussion of 
peace and security. Israel must understand this well." 
  He added: "No one can force Syria to take any position that 
conflicts with its principles and aims. Syria wants an 
honorable peace that guarantees security for all states in the 
region."

<F P=106> [Report by Ruba al-Husari and Ibrahim al-Humaydi: "Sources </F>
in Damascus Talk of Five-Point Plan; Last Point Concerns 
Normalization"] 
  [Excerpts] Occupied Jerusalem, Damascus -- [passage 
omitted] Well-informed sources in Damascus have told AL-HAYAH 
that Syria has defined a view of five sequential points to 
advance negotiations with Israel. They did not rule out that 
normalization would be discussed in the final stage. While an 
Israeli source said yesterday that the main aim of the current 
Christopher tour "is to form a joint Syrian-Israeli committee to 
be entrusted with drawing up draft future border security 
arrangements between the two countries." [passage omitted] 
  The sources added that Syrian officials have rejected a 
phased withdrawal. They cited the affirmation by a Syrian 
source on the eve of Christopher's arrival in Damascus that 
"Syria is not willing to deal with any Israeli proposals not 
containing a clear commitment to withdrawing from all the Golan 
within a reasonable and acceptable period." 
  The sources stressed to AL-HAYAH that progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track should follow the following sequence: 
  -- the Israeli Knesset decision to annex the Golan and to 
apply Israeli laws on the Heights should be revoked; 
  -- the principle should be accepted of Syria's absolute 
sovereignty over the Golan territory and willingness to withdraw 
completely from it should be announced; 
  -- the peaceful solution should be within the framework of 
a comprehensive settlement on all fronts; 
  -- security measures on both sides of the border should be 
equal, and the security of all states should be guaranteed; 
  -- Syria is willing to discuss the other questions related 
to relations (normalization, the opening of an embassy, trade 
exchange) within the framework of the land-for-peace principle. 
  The sources stressed that recognition of Syria's sovereignty 
over the Golan is a "base" for discussing all the other 
questions between the two countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Damascus, May 15 (AFP) -- Syria is willing to 
discuss an Israeli offer to leave the Golan Heights on condition 
it pledges a complete withdrawal within a "reasonable" time, the 
government newspaper TISHRIN said on Sunday [15 May]. 
  The remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher was expected here later in his second peace shuttle 
to Syria and Israel in a month to forge a peace deal between the 
arch enemies. 
  On his last trip two weeks ago he delivered to Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad proposals from Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin for a phased withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
which Israel conquered in 1967. 
  Rabin has offered to return three of five Druze villages on 
the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over 
five-eight years. But details of the peace plan have been kept 
secret. 
  Syria turned down the offer and sent a list of questions to 
the Israeli authorities with Christopher demanding 
clarifications. 
  Diplomats said the exchange of messages between the 
arch-enemies was a good sign of their intentions to try to 
narrow differences between them. 
  "The (Syrian) list included some very specific questions 
which opened the way for a concrete and serious debate," a 
Western diplomat in Damascus said. 
  Meanwhile a senior Israeli official said in Jerusalem that 
Christopher would try to persuade Syria to set up a joint 
military commission with Israel in a fresh bid to unblock their 
peace talks. 
  "This trip will aim mainly to establish a military 
commission 
between the two countries," he said Sunday. 
  "The commission would draft security arrangements for the 
border region and report back to the politicians." 
  A similar commission was set up by Egypt and Israel and 
helped to bring the old enemies together in a peace agreement, 
the official noted. 
  Syria's official press also called on the United States to 
honour a pledge to play a full partner role in the peace 
process, saying it was not enough for Christopher to be a mere 
postman between them. 
  "Damascus will not negotiate any Israeli proposals which do 
not stipulate a clear engagement for a complete withdrawal in a 
reasonable time," TISHRIN newspaper said in a front-page 
editorial. 
  The commentary, entitled "Will Israel Take the Adequate 
Decision," went on to say that the ball lay in the Israeli court 
"and those who give it support" referring to the United States. 
  The English-language SYRIA TIMES said progress depended on 
"Washington playing its full partner role." 
  "This role should be effective and not ink on paper," the 
daily said. 
  Syrian demand for an Israeli pledge to withdraw totally from 
the Golan Heights, which the Jewish state annexed in 1981, has 
been a major stumbling block in the peace process. 
  Christopher, who is in Geneva for talks on the former 
Yugoslavia, said he expected the process of reconciling Israel 
and Syria to be "long." 
  On Monday he flies to Israel and has not ruled out a return 
visit to Damascus before leaving the region on Thursday. 
  "I do think the parties are serious and I want to play my 
part and take messages back and forth," Christopher said. 
  A Western diplomat in Damascus ruled out any Syrian 
concessions over the Golan. 
  "Syria is not like the Palestine Liberation Organisation," 
which signed a peace accord with Israel on May 4 for launching 
Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho, he said. 
  "Syria will never agree to signing a peace agreement that 
does not clearly call for a complete (Israeli) withdrawal from 
the Golan. It cannot do less than al-Sadat. It wants to do 
better than al- Sadat," the diplomat added. 
  The late Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat became the first 
Arab leader to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1978 and to 
obtain a total Israel withdrawal from the Sinai desert.

<F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat </F>
'Abd-al-Majid, in Damascus, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; 
date not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] A meeting of the Higher Committee 
for Coordination among Joint Arab Committees has started in 
Damascus. Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid, who opened the meeting, is with us on the 
telephone. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, welcome to our program. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, what ideas have you 
raised 
at the Higher Committee meeting? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The Higher Committee comprises all the 
organizations working under the umbrella of the Arab League. 
The committee met last in Alexandria upon the invitation of the 
Arab Maritime Transport Academy. This meeting in Damascus is 
hosted by the Arab Arid Land Bureau. Various 
organizations--economic, agricultural, social, cultural, and 
educational--are taking part. The aim of the meeting is to 
coordinate Arab policies in various fields. We review the 
organizations' activities and coordinate among them. There are, 
of course, some projects undertaken jointly by more than one 
organization, such as the Agricultural Development Organization 
and the organization dealing with water issues. We seek to 
coordinate that work and enhance its efficiency. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Has anything new come up since the 
Alexandria 
meeting that will be discussed at the current session? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] There have been important developments 
concerning GATT, signed recently in Morocco, and some joint 
projects, particularly those concerning agricultural development 
and water resources. These issues are also within the Arab 
League's scope because they affect the Arab people and economy. 
Our aim is to maximize the benefits accrued to the Arab economy 
as a whole. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Will the current meeting come up with a 
vision for Arab cooperation, particularly as we are seeking to 
enhance cooperation among Arab countries? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Correct. This is the goal we seek. In this 
regard I can confidently state that there are no political 
differences. There is cooperation on issues leading to 
comprehensive development. All the Arab countries are eager to 
see these organizations promote the interests of all Arab 
citizens, from the ocean to the Gulf. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Where is the Yemeni crisis headed? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] You know that the Arab League, upon a 
resolution adopted at the recent meeting of its council, has 
dispatched a delegation to Sanaa. The delegation is still 
there. Its members met senior officials and delivered my message 
to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The message basically 
stresses the need for a cease-fire and for finding ways to 
contain this crisis. Undoubtedly, we all hope we can create 
favorable circumstances for a dialogue among the Yemeni brothers 
to stop the fighting and bloodshed. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Reports say that you have put forward 
proposals that have not yet been publicized. Have you received 
a Yemeni response? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] There are telephone contacts with Sanaa and 
the Arab League delegation there. God willing, when I return to 
Cairo the delegation will have returned from Sanaa. We will 
have a clearer picture then. The situation is difficult. I 
hope the fighting will end so that we can seek a solution to 
this serious problem. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you think the Yemeni parties will respond 
to your proposals or will they insist that it is an internal 
affair? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] There is certainly a difference of opinion 
and a crisis among brothers. What concerns the Arab League and 
any party acting as a mediator is to find ourselves in a 
situation that facilitates dialogue among the parties concerned 
instead of fighting. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] When Yemeni unity was announced, the Arab 
League praised it, viewing it as exemplary. In view of what is 
happening right now, can we view things as a real test of the 
League's management of Arab issues? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] We are doing our utmost. I must say that the 
issue is primarily up to the Yemeni brothers rather than the 
Arab League or any other mediation that seeks to end the 
fighting among brothers. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] If the Yemeni parties fail to respond to 
your 
proposals, will the League pursue a different approach? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] We will take things as they come. Let us 
first see what this stage will produce. We hope to contain the 
situation and avert further deterioration at least. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you my brother.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- Iran's Red Crescent Society 
(IRCS) has so far sent some 5,000 tons of relief supplies 
including foodstuff and clothings to Bosnia-Herzegovina since 
the start of Serbian aggression against Bosnian Muslims, 
reported the IRCS's public relations department today. 
  The relief supplies, shipped aboard seven airplanes, 25 
trucks and a cargo ship, have been sent to the war stricken 
Bosnian Muslims, the report said. 
  In order to avoid high transportation costs, the IRCS has 
also purchased relief supplies worth about dlrs 250,000 from 
Bosnia's neighboring countries and has distributed them among 
Bosnian Muslims, it said. 
  The IRCS's relief operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
coordinated by four of its branches, three of which are located 
in Zagreb, Sarajevo and Slovenia.

  [Text] In tandem with the declaration of the Iranian 
pilgrims' day of support for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the representative of the supreme leader and the head of the 
Iranian pilgrims to the house of God staged a spectacular 
ceremony at the mission of the esteemed leadership in holy Mecca 
last night. 
  During the ceremony, which was attended by many Iranian and 
non-Iranian pilgrims, Ayatollah Jannati, the supreme leader's 
representative on Bosnia-Herzegovina affairs, discussed the 
Serbs' numerous crimes and the oppression of the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Criticizing the silence and indifference by 
international forums and by heads of Islamic countries, he said: 
The land of revelation and the house of God are the best venues 
for defending oppressed Muslim nations, especially the oppressed 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Why should Hajj officials be 
satisfied with praying and prevent practical steps from being 
taken in support of the Bosnian Muslims? 
  Referring to the Islamic Republic's assistance and support 
for the oppressed Bosnian Muslims, he said: We have always 
stressed that without the least bit of irreverence for the house 
of God and by fully observing order, the problems and 
difficulties of 1 billion Muslims should be propounded and 
solutions found. The issues that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
raises are not its own issues; they are the problems of the 
world of Islam. He added: Today no issue is being attacked as 
much as Islam. Muslim nations are aggressed and placed under 
pressure on charges of wanting Islam. 
  Saudi Government officials have officially disagreed with 
the 
declaration of the day of support for the oppressed Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the collection of aid for them. 
Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the 
representative of the supreme leader and head of the Iranian 
pilgrims to the house of God, stated in reply to a letter from 
the Saudi minister of pilgrimage: We are surprised that the 
Saudi Government is raising the issue of helping the Muslim 
nation in Bosnia and calling on Friday imams to pray for the 
nation, yet preventing Iranian pilgrims from trying to help the 
Bosnian Muslims and collect aid for them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Putting Emphasis on Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] The annual pilgrimage this year is to begin on May 
19, and Iran flew the first batch of its some 60,000 pilgrims to 
Mecca early this month. 
  The political atmosphere surrounding the pilgrimage for 
Iranians this year is decidedly different from the one last 
year. If Riyadh's attitude towards Iranian pilgrims was 
friendly then, this year it is a hostile one. If the Saudis 
were cooperative and accommodating last year, this year they are 
trying to make sure Iranian pilgrims would be inconvenienced. 
  According to reports dispatched from Medina, the Saudi 
police 
has kept Iranian pilgrims under intense surveillance and they 
are not left alone to do their religious duties even when 
visiting the tombs of the members of the Prophet's household 
held most dear by Iranians. The Iranian pilgrims are also 
prevented from doing the secondary rituals that usually go with 
Hajj within the confines of their own religious traditions. The 
Saudis are imposing on Iranians their own religious 
interpretation. Altogether the pilgrims are complaining that 
the Saudi police is mistreating and insulting them. 
  The Islamic Republic's present problem with Saudi Arabia is 
not limited to whether or not Riyadh should allow the Iranian 
pilgrims to do their religious-political demonstration, which is 
regarded as a duty. It is not even over the number of pilgrims 
that should be admitted in Mecca. It goes much beyond that. 
  With the change of policy on Iran, Riyadh wants to register 
its dissatisfaction with Tehran's conduct of regional (Mideast) 
policy. Riyadh regards the various Islamic movements in some of 
the Middle Eastern countries as having been instigated or 
supported by Iran. It disapproves of Iran's stance toward the 
Israel-PLO peace treaty as well. 
  As far as the Iranians' religious demonstration is 
concerned, 
the Saudis' refusal has been unduly inimical. Last year the 
Saudis' approach towards this issue was flexible. Iranian 
pilgrims were allowed to stage the rally within the premises of 
their residence in Mecca. A similar and mutually accepted 
arrangement can be worked out for this year as well. On the 
number of Iranian pilgrims to go to Mecca, Tehran argues that 
there has been a sudden unilateral change in the quota. The 
earlier agreement allowed Iran to send two pilgrims per thousand 
of its population. Riyadh has changed that to one now, using a 
contrived argument. 
  Here in Iran there is this feeling that Riyadh has had a 
change of mind, from one of exercising an independent policy of 
its own to following the U.S. policy of trying to isolate and 
put pressure on Iran. 
  Everything considered, the present course of exchanges 
between Riyadh and Tehran is confrontational in character. And 
a confrontational policy is not in the interest of either 
country nor that of the Persian Gulf region as a whole either. 
After having gone through two wars, and experienced their 
futility and wastefulness, what the Persian Gulf region needs is 
calm, understanding and cooperativeness to engage in 
construction. 
  Unfriendly state of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as 
Persian Gulf's biggest two countries, causes friction and 
tension that lead to the loss of human energy that should be 
used on construction. They also open the way for increased 
intervention by foreign powers who would be asking for an ever 
growing share of the Persian Gulf countries' resources for what 
little they would give. 
  What Riyadh and Tehran need is to engage in dialogue towards 
permanent accommodation of their legitimate concerns. The 
emphasis on ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia should be a 
well-studied and prudent one founded on friendship and 
solidarity, and not on raising fingers on each other or 
zig-zagging between tension and calm.

  [Text] Mecca, May 14, IRNA -- Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad

from the disbelievers. 
  He observed that God willing the rally will go ahead as 
planned without any untoward incident.

  [Text] Please listen to a report we have just received. 
Following the difficulties created by the Saudi Arabian 
Government for the esteemed leader's mission office at Mecca 
concerning the performance of the Disavowal of Polytheists 
ceremony, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri wrote 
a letter today to the leader of the Islamic revolution. 
  Referring to the provocations of Saudi security officials 
and 
military forces who, using war equipment and resorting to 
provocative actions, prevented Iranian pilgrims from going to 
the esteemed leader's mission office to perform the Disavowal of 
Polytheists rites, he asked the esteemed leader to cancel the 
ritual. 
  The texts of Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammadi-Reyshahri's letter 
and 
the esteemed leader's reply are as follows: 
  With greetings to the esteemed leader of the Islamic 
revolution, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i. As you are aware, 
this year, as in previous years, the committed and vigilant 
pilgrims to the Holy House of God -- inspired by the guidances 
of the late imam, the reviver of the Abrahamite pilgrimage, and 
his competent successor and the continuer of his path -- are 
once again ready to raise the sacred banner of the disavowal of 
polytheism, blasphemy, and arrogance in the land of divine 
inspiration. However, Saudi security officials and military 
forces, using war equipment, in an irresponsible and provocative 
act, have besieged the mission building since three days before 
the ceremony, and by restricting the traffic of pilgrims are in 
effect preventing the performance of the divine ceremony. 
  It is astonishing that right next to the House of 
Monotheism, 
Muslims cannot disavow polytheists and express their hatred and 
disgust for the ringleaders of polytheism, headed by America and 
usurper Israel. 
  The Saudi authorities must answer to the vigilant Muslims of 
the world as to why the cry of disavowal of polytheists and the 
call of Muslims to unity against enemies of Islam are so 
unpalatable to them. 
  Under the present circumstances, guided by the instructions 
of your eminence, to deprive the Saudi authorities of any excuse 
to desecrate the Holy House of God, the Disavowal ceremony has 
been cancelled. 
  I should point out, although military forces have prevented 
the performance of the Disavowal rites, and have not let the cry 
of disavowal of committed pilgrims to the House of God rise from 
the center of monotheism and echo in the world, undoubtedly 
their innocent silence, more than any cry, will shake the 
fortresses of polytheists and the arrogant, and deliver the 
message of the Islamic revolution to the people of the world. 
  I deem it necessary to thank and praise the dear pilgrim 
brothers and sisters, especially the committed clergy, the war 
disabled, freed POWs, and families of martyrs, who have 
constantly demonstrated their competence and political maturity 
to defend dear Islam and the Islamic revolution and to follow 
the goals of the esteemed leader, for their dutifulness and 
alertness. 
  May God make the Islamic revolution of Iran a prelude to the 
global rule of Islam and continue casting your eminence's 
auspicious shadow upon the world Muslims. 
  [signed] Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, representative of the 
Supreme Jurisconsult and supervisor of pilgrims, 16 May 
  The text of the reply by His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, 
the esteemed leader of the Islamic revolution, to Mr Mohammadi- 
Reyshahri's letter is as follows: 
  In his exalted name. With greetings to your excellency 
Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri, may your 
shadow continue. I received your message. Considering the 
situation that you have reported, I endorse the cancelling of 
the Disavowal of Polytheists ceremony. 
  May God cover your excellency and all pilgrims to the Holy 
House of God, especially the dear Iranian pilgrims, with His 
blessings and guidance and accept their pilgrimage. 
  Peace and God's mercy be upon you. 
  [signed] Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i.

  [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- A Persian daily Tuesday 
commented on the cancellation of the "Deliverance From 
Unbelievers" ceremony, scheduled to be held in Mecca today, and 
said the silent kept by Hajj pilgims was an indication to the 
oppression of Islam and Muslims even in the land of revelation. 
[sentence as received] 
  Reports from Mecca said that the Saudi police have stationed 
armoured personnel carriers, various weaponry and a large number 
of infantry around the headquarters of the leader's 
representative in Hajj-related affairs, creating a state similar 
to that of martial law. 
  It is crystal clear, said "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" in its 
editorial, that Riyadh government has been under pressure by 
both the U.S. Administration and the Zionists for cancelling the 
ceremony. 
  But, added the article, the problem is that if Riyadh has 
some undertakings towards the U.S., Muslims also have undeniable 
responsibilities towrads Islam and other Muslims. 
  The Hajj season is an exceptional opportunity for Muslims to 
get acquainted with the sufferings and problems of other nations 
in order to find solutions for them, it said. 
  Deliverance from unbelievers and enemies of Islam is among 
the political principles of Hajj rituals and the least Hajj 
pilgrims can perform compared to the broad dimensions of the 
problems engulfing the Islamic world, the daily concluded.

  [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- Majles Speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri here Tuesday expressed regret over the measures taken 
by Saudi rulers to prevent the "Disavowal of Pagans" ceremony by 
Hajj pilgrims in Mecca. 
  Since the ceremony threatens the interests of the global 
arrogance and its allies, the Saudi rulers prevented the Iranian 
pilgrims and those from other countries from holding the 
ceremony, said the speaker at the open session of Majles. Such 
actions were not unexpected from Saudi rulers in order to serve 
the interests of the enemies of Islam, he said adding that 
fortunately they were thwarted by the awareness of the leader's 
representative for Hajj-related affairs, Mohammad 
Mohammadi-Reyshahri. 
  The speaker then described today's silence of Hajj pilgrims 
as very meaningful and added that this would exopose the real 
nature of the Saudi rulers for the Muslims world over.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This year the fear felt by the 
masters who have been harmed by the disavowal of polytheists' 
cries by the Muslims of Iran and elsewhere made the unfit 
servants of the city of God create an atmosphere of terror, 
resort to threats, and arm their police force and obstruct the 
disavowal of polytheists. It is under these conditions that the 
skillful physician of the world of Islam--the esteemed guardian 
of the Muslims' cause--approved canceling the disavowal of 
polytheists' ceremony. 
  Until the direct confrontations between the enemies of the 
Muslims and the pagan-breaking ceremonies for the disavowal of 
polytheists, some people had not understood the philosophy 
behind the Islamic Republic's insistence on holding the 
disavowal marches and ceremonies and asked themselves and 
others: What need is there for marches and struggles during the 
Hajj pilgrimage and in the hot weather? And if the cry of 
disavowal is raised, what harm will be done to arrogance? The 
simple-minded thought that the so-called civilized world of the 
world-devourers would tolerate such political problems and allow 
opponents the right to live, to demonstrate, and to hold 
marches. This allegation was based on permission being given 
for marches in the so-called free Western countries. But it 
should be clarified that those marches do not harm the 
superpowers and other powers; it is the Mecca and Medina marches 
that spark Muslim unity. It is the march in the city of God 
that makes the polytheists tremble with fear. 
  The brave and alert Iranian nation and Muslim nations of the 
world should know that their declaration of solidarity and their 
marches in support of the Muslim nations, especially of the 
Palestinian and Bosnian nations, are not only effective, but 
will make the polytheists tremble.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, who 
is visiting Tehran at the head of a senior delegation, had 
positive and constructive talks with our country's economic and 
political officials and signed a number of agreements on various 
fields of cooperation. The visit has removed many obstacles in 
the path of expanding relations between the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and Kazakhstan. 
  In his travels the Kazakh prime minister also visited 
Esfehan's steel mill and historic sites and travelled to the 
Kish free trade zone. 
  The visits were aimed at familiarization with the actual and 
potential capacities for cooperation between the two countries 
in the fields of industry, trade, services, and communications 
and could lead to new fields for cooperation. 
  The Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan is connected to 
Iran 
through the Caspian Sea but relations between the two people 
supercedes geographic borders because the two nations enjoy 
common historic sources of religion and culture, the roots of 
which are of great interest for Kazakhs. 
  Now, following independence, Kazakhstan like other Central 
Asian republics has an opportunity to give new dimensions to 
these ancient ties and to expand them into economic and trade 
cooperation. 
  Since Kazakhstan's independence the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, 
too, has welcomed and been a vanguard, together with other 
Central Asian Muslim republics, in improving various fields of 
cooperation, so that cooperation will be beneficial to both 
nations. 
  Kazakhstan is among the republics which have great potential 
for cooperation with the Islamic republic of Iran in all fields. 
And this is also true for our country because both countries, 
as well as extraordinary underground riches, enjoy a strong and 
relatively matching industrial and trade infrastructure and 
could be close and reliable partners in special areas such as 
oil, transfer of energy, land-air-sea transportation, and 
industry. 
  In this respect our country's geographic position as a 
bridge 
linking the Kazakhstan republic to free international waters is 
an important point. 
  The agreements reached between the high-level Kazakh 
delegation and our country's political and economic officials 
cover many areas of cooperation. It is hoped that cooperation 
and ties between the two countries will enter a more advanced 
stage with the implementation of the plans for cooperation which 
have been the subject of the recent agreements.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani termed as "important" Kazakhstan's links with 
Iran's Caspian Sea provinces in further activating the trade 
ties between the private sectors of the two countries. 
  The president made the remark here monday in his meeting 
with 
visiting Kazakh premier, Sergey Tereshchenko. He described as 
positive the political will existing in both the countries for 
strengthening of mutual cooperation and called for putting into 
practice the agreements reached between Tehran and Almaty. 
  The president referred to the setting up of a free trade 
zone 
at the port city of Bandar Anzali, and said this would greatly 
strengthen Kazakhstan's links with Iran's Caspian provinces of 
Gilan and Mazandaran by facilitating trade exchanges and making 
the private sectors of the two countries more involved. The 
decision to declare Bandar Anzali as free trade zone was taken 
yesterday at the end of the president's inspection tour of Gilan 
Province. 
  The southern shores of the oblong Caspian, the world's 
largest inland sea, are hemmed in by Iran, while the northern 
and part of the northeastern shores forms the Kazakhstan 
coastline. 
  The other three countries with access to Caspian waters are 
the Russian Federation on the northwest, the Azerbaijan Republic 
on the southwest and Turkmenistan on the southeast. 
  Tereshchenko who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, submitted 
Rafsanjani a message from Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev 
and said Tehran-Almaty ties had further expanded especially 
after Nazarbayev's visit to Iran. 
  He said Iran's valuable experiences in establishing 
industries and re-activating factories was very useful for his 
country. 
  Raising the volume of Tehran-Almaty wheat and coal exchanges 
in the long-term, Kazakhstan's purchase of copper and 
fire-resistant material from Iran, joint production of engine 
oil and expanding road, rail, shipping and air transportation 
between the two countries were among the topics Tereshchenko 
discussed with Iranian officials.

after signing a memorandum of understanding with First Vice 
President Hasan Habibi. 
  Another letter of understanding on banking cooperation was 
also inked by the governors of the Iranian and Kazakh central

scientific and cultural cooperation.

at the bilateral level and within the framework of the 10-nation 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).

Sea in the promotion of mutual relations and agreed to speed up 
the formulation of a convention on economic cooperation among 
countries bordering the world's largest inland sea.

southern -- of the Caspian. The other countries bordering the 
oblong sea are the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan Republic and

  [Text] On the second day of his visit to Gilan, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani attended the session of the provincial 
administrative council. At this session, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed his gratitude for the pure 
sentiments of the dedicated people of Gilan and asked the 
officials to be more compassionate toward the people. He said 
that the people fully comprehend the difference between service 
and work on the one hand and the mere shouting of slogans. 
  Regarding the supply of potable water in Gilan, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that with the construction of the Estur 
dam, the needs of the province would be fully met. He said: We 
have approved Anzali port as a protected area; this will 
naturally cause a major change in Gilan Province. He added: 
Bandar-e Anzali is certainly one of the focuses for our trade 
activity in Central Asia. Astara has its own role to play and we 
are striving to implement massive projects in Astara as well. 
With the construction of a huge bridge in Astara, we will be 
able to link all routes to Astara; this in itself will have a 
great impact on transit and maritime activities. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: We have raised the purchase prices 
of green tea leaves by 14 percent and we pay a further 17 
percent to the tea-manufacturing plants. As for the 
construction of tea-manufacturing plants, we should act in such 
a way that the people and the private sector stand to gain by 
participating in this field. We should encourage investment in 
this country. 
  He continued: At present our factories do not need steel and 
petrochemicals, and many spare parts are also manufactured in 
this country. Much of the other materials are also being 
manufactured in Iran. All this indicates that this is a period 
of endeavor and construction in our country. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani called on all 'ulema, Friday 
imams, clerics, Majles deputies, the Voice and Vision and other 
public media of the country to motivate the people so that the 
cash which is hoarded or used to buy foreign exchange and coins 
is channeled into investments in major infrastructural projects. 
  The president then referred to changing most of the highways 
of Gilan into freeways, especially the Rasht-Qazvin highway, 
adding: The Government will provide financial assistance. 
Coastal highways are also being studied. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani dispatched a team to the 
deprived areas of Gilan yesterday to study the problems and 
difficulties of the deprived areas of Gilan Province. This team 
is led by Besharati, head of the office of the country's 
deprived areas; it will visit the villages of Shemam, Deylaman, 
and Totli. The members of the team met the people of these 
villages and familiarized themselves with their problems and 
difficulties at close quarters.

visited, we saw the people at the highest point of Islamic and 
revolutionary zeal. This makes me happy and I pray for these 
people who are showing their presence on the scene in this way; 
it gladdens the friends of the revolution and disappoints its 
enemies. 
  Of course this presence is something the mass media should 
show for everyone to see. I cannot describe it. Satellites 
should carry reports on this so that those who think there is a 
distance between the people and the officials in Iran can see 
the real situation and review their assessments. [passage 
omitted on meetings with the disabled, the 'ulema, academicians, 
teachers, and other provincial officials, and on some of the 
projects inspected] 
  We inspected the reconstructed areas in Rudbar and Manjil. 
It is a great source of pride that in four years this extensive 
area in Qazvin and Gilan, where around 240,000 units, including 
factories, plants, big bridges, dams, and so on, were destroyed 
or badly damaged by quake, have been reconstructed. Some 85 to 
90 percent have been reconstructed. Some say 30 percent of the 
area has not been reconstructed. But that is not what we saw. 
The two cities of Rudbar and Manjil have become two modern 
cities with modern boulevards, streets, and strong antiquake 
buildings. The people there were extremely happy and satisfied. 
[passage omitted] 
  We visited an exhibition in Rasht organized for our visit. 
Over 200 agricultural, animal breeding, fishing, industrial, 
handicraft, and other units participated in the exhibition. 
[passage omitted] Many of the participants said they are 
exporting and cited big export figures. Interesting is that 
during the past two years-- since we declared our new foreign 
exchange policies--most of these units have stopped meeting 
their needs abroad and are supplying their needs from domestic 
sources. Some of them still depend on iron smelting and so on 
but are waiting for these plants to become operational at home. 
Some also complained of a shortage of foreign exchange and raw 
materials. But I think that this year they will have no 
problems with these. I was extremely impressed with the 
industrial face of Rasht. [passage omitted] 
  In Astara we inaugurated the new building of the Free 
Islamic 
University. We inspected the cargo-unloading project for trains 
arriving in Astara from Azerbaijan. We also inspected the 
railway that will link Azerbaijan with Astara and provide a link 
with a multipurpose port being built by the Reconstruction 
Jihad. This port will be used both for fishing and trade. 
Astara is a border city to which we should grant significance. 
These projects are necessary there. We are also constructing a 
large bridge over the Astara River. [passage omitted] 
  In Anzali we saw the Mirza Kuchek Khan ship, now forging a 
strong passenger route between Iran and the other northern 
countries. This ship raises the Islamic Republic's prestige in 
the Caspian Sea. I advise our compatriots to seize the tourist 
opportunity being offered there. 
  We also named a protected area at Anzali, next to the sea 
and near the existing port. Earlier we approved the plan for 
this region at the Supreme Council for Free Trade Zones. The 
designation of this area as a protected area needs no Majles 
approval. This area can be like one created in Sirjan. But 
this one may be stronger because seven or eight countries in the 
north can also use it and complement it, since a trade link 
between the north and the south needs such an area in the north. 
Our second center will be around the gulf of Gorgan and between 
Bandar-e Gaz and Bandar-e Torkaman. This plan has been 
approved. The only thing that should be done is to designate 
the area. [passage omitted] 
  I said that the devotion and the national and Islamic 
sentiment I saw in Gilan was at its peak and could not have been 
better. And our nation can see the presence on the scene of the 
people in Gilan. This made me think about why these people's 
revolutionary zeal is so strong 15 years after the revolution. 
I was truly surprised. There is great negative propaganda 
against the government, especially because of the high prices 
and other problems, which are being raised in newspapers and by 
speakers and exaggerated by foreigners, so I thought the people 
would be disappointed. But they were so zealous, happy, and 
affectionate; this is something I would like to comment on. 
  The people there are alert and literate. They are among the 
most literate people in our country as far as higher education 
is concerned. They are very cultured and they can analyze the 
situation. They also feel the realities. The coordination 
among the clergymen, the deputies, and the management is also 
among the effective elements creating this situation. And the 
security in the province is truly awe-inspiring. The 
law-enforcement forces, the [Islamic Revolution Guards] Corps, 
the Basijis, and all those dealing with information and security 
have truly done a good job there. 
  I would like to cite a professor at Gilan University. The 
people in Gilan feel that something is being done and that 
infrastructural activities are being carried out. They also 
hear that activities are being carried out in the fields of 
steel, mining, shipping, ports, power plants, and 
telecommunications. They see what is going on in their own 
province. The people see that many things are being done. They 
understand the infrastructural activities and they are hopeful 
for the future. This university professor told me that a survey 
has shown that not since the Achamaenids and Medes has so much 
been done for the country's development. Part of this is 
natural, since times have changed and more means for progress 
and development are available. But during the past 30-40 years 
these same means were not used. The people feel this. Wherever 
they go they see a development project being implemented and 
capital being invested for the country's development. And they 
see this as good will. [passage omitted] 
  The people see that there is no reason for them to believe 
what the enemies say and to be fooled by what the defeatists 
say. These are all felt by the people. They understand that 
there are high prices in the country too. But they themselves 
produce rice and tea. Before the revolution they used to sell 
their tea for 35 rials but now we buy tea from them at 570 
rials. The same applies to their rice, honey, cattle, and so 
on. They understand that when something is bought at a high 
price it is sold at a high price. We are not satisfied with 
these high prices and we want to stop the profiteers. God 
willing, we will start our efforts to end this situation this 
year. But the people understand that the prevailing prices are 
the solution to the problem. If the price of tea was 30 to 40 
rials no one would plant tea. And if rice was 70 to 80 rials no 
one would cultivate it. The people understand this. The entire 
nation understands this. 
  At the end of my visit, I thank everyone--the 'ulema, the 
deputies, the managers, the law-enforcement forces, the Corps, 
the Basijis, the families of the martyrs, and everyone. I hope 
we can fulfill the promises we have made during this visit and 
tend to the people's affairs better. 
  God's peace be upon you.

  [Excerpts] The esteemed leader of the Islamic revolution, 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, has met the chancellor and 
deputy heads of the Islamic Open University [IAU] and the heads 
of this university's branches from all over the country. He 
made a speech praising the role played by the IAU in providing 
higher education in every region of the country. The esteemed 
leader stressed the need for maintaining the religious and 
revolutionary atmosphere ruling over the IAU. 
  During the meeting the esteemed leader welcomed the future 
IAU plans to upgrade the academic achievements of this 
university and to promote full supremacy of Islamic values. He 
said: The IAU atmosphere must be protected from the penetration 
of poisonous and anti-Islamic thoughts, and the managing board 
of this private university is justified in preventing the 
expression of any remarks against the Islamic and revolutionary 
values in the teaching and research environment. [passage 
omitted] 
  The esteemed leader of the Islamic revolution referred to 
the 
strong religious and revolutionary belief of the people as the 
main factor enabling them to stand against the all-round 
pressures of the enemies of Islam. 
  In conclusion, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i stressed 
that 
the IAU graduates, who are blessed with Islamic ethics, will be 
accepted and relied upon in all departments of the regime.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon delivered by Ayatollah </F>
Mohammad Emami-Kashani, spokesman for the Guardians Council, in 
Tehran on 13 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The arrogant West and the 
enemies of Islam are scared of this system, a system based on 
theology and justice, a system whose nation is so alert and 
vigilant. Therefore, there are conspiracies. Installing the 
device at the Iranian Embassy in London -- which, as you heard, 
our Foreign Ministry explained to the people -- by Britain, that 
old, decrepit, fallen, and defeated politician, is one of the 
plots. That "Satanic Verses" book written by that despicable 
person, whom I do not want to name, was another, and so on. 
  These are the conspiracies the arrogant world is hatching 
now. International forums and organizations are under its 
control. Decision-making centers are under its thumb. With 
great regret, certain governments of Islamic countries are in 
its service. It can control the ebb and flow of the resources 
of many Islamic countries. This is the situation that the 
arrogant world has created. 
  It is scared of Islam, so you see how it treats Muslims in 
Bosnia, Palestine, Algeria, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and other 
Islamic countries, and inside Islamic countries. 
  There exists an evil triangle: on the one side is world 
arrogance, led by America; on the other, the residues of the 
collapsed East, and the third side is Zionism, which by its 
nature is an ally of the other two sides of the triangle. They 
have created this situation in the world of Islam. 
  What Islam and the Koran offer as a solution is that victory 
is the triumph of right, and God's triumph is success. 
Deviation from the path of God brings failure and wretchedness. 
Jihad, alertness, self-sacrifice, selflessness, and solidarity 
are among what we see liberating nations, and their inception is 
from Islamic Iran, the land of Islam. That is why the world of 
arrogance has risen against it. We should recognize such 
conspiracies. God be praised, our nation is aware of such 
conspiracies and is still brave. We should go on knowing that 
God's victory is with us, God's triumph is with us, and the last 
word is said and will be said by Islam, God willing. [crowd 
chants: "God is great," "Death to America," "Death to Israel," 
other indistinct slogans] [passage omitted] 
  I wish to say prayers to plead with God to remove the 
difficulties facing the Islamic world. I also wish to pray for 
the speedy recovery of those suffering illness, particularly for 
Ayatollah Khaza'ali, who is hospitalized and is suffering from a 
heart ailment. May God cut off the hands of blasphemy. May God 
turn the evil of oppressors onto themselves and may He assist 
the suffering Muslims, particularly in Bosnia, Palestine, and 
other regions. May God assist the dear leader of the 
revolution. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Tariq Tarshishi: "Al-Hariri Insists That </F>
Franjiyah Must Leave Cabinet"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut -- As Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri 
stayed away for the third day, mediation efforts were 
deadlocked, and hopes are now pinned on a Syrian mediation to 
resolve the crisis between the Lebanese leaders who are in 
disagreement on the question of reshuffling Prime Minister 
al-Hariri's cabinet. 
  A prominent mediator told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the local 
mediations stopped following the appearance of obstacles which 
are insurmountable without Syrian mediation. Syria has often 
mediated and ironed out such obstacles in the past. The 
conclusions reached by the mediators were as follows: 
  1. Prime Minister al-Hariri insists that the cabinet must be 
reshuffled and made effective and he is not prepared to change 
that position. He is willing to discuss eliminating the 
difficulties in his relations with President Ilyas al-Hirawi and 
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri after the reshuffle. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri bases that position on his 
conviction that keeping the cabinet as it is now implies the 
intention to get rid of him because it would mean that the 
cabinet would be under the threat of defeat. [passage omitted] 
  2. The president of the republic is agreeable to a cabinet 
reshuffle. The reshuffle draft al-Hariri took with him to 
Damascus last Saturday had the approval of the president. 
  3. The Chamber of Deputies speaker would support a reshuffle 
affecting the Interior Ministry provided that that portfolio is 
given to Deputy Prime Minister Engineer Michel al-Murr with the 
current Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij becoming state 
minister or social affairs minister. Birri believes that such a 
step would "put things right." 
  If there is to be a reshuffle, he insists that the Finance 
Ministry should go to a Shiite in place of Minister Fu'ad 
Sinyurah. 
  The same mediator told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that among the 
obstacles which could not be overcome without Syrian mediation 
were the fact that Prime Minister al-Hariri wants Minister of 
Municipal and Village Affairs Sulayman Franjiyah out of the 
cabinet, and Birri's insistence that the finance minister must 
be a Shiite in any cabinet reshuffle. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Shuqayr: "Ruling Out of Syrian-Lebanese </F>
Meeting Reactivates Local Mediations"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut -- The ruling out of a Lebanese-Syrian 
meeting to find a way out of the seclusion [staying away from 
office] which Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri started last Sunday 
[8 May] -- contrary to most ministers' expectation that Syrian 
Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam would arrive any minute -- 
has caused brokers to resume their mediation between the state 
leaders in a bid to secure a solution, turn the seclusion page, 
and pave the way for a revival of cooperation between the 
legislative and procedural authorities on the one hand and 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister al-Hariri on the 
other. [passage omitted] 
  One minister told AL-HAYAH that "since the political crisis 
erupted in Beirut Damascus has avoided taking part in the 
campaigns or focusing light on the dispute, either through its 
official media services or sources in Lebanon." 
  The minister adds: "We had thought that the Syrian vice 
president would head directly for Beirut after his return from 
Johannesburg, or that the three leaders [president, prime 
minister, and Chamber of Deputies speaker] would go to Damascus 
to search for a solution to the crisis. I was surprised by the 
Syrian leadership's announcement the moment the crisis started 
that it has nothing to do with the conflict and that it prefers 
not to intervene in favor of any party. Damascus believes that 
for the three leaders to reach an understanding is the guarantee 
for bringing an end to the political conditions resulting from 
the prime minister's seclusion. It will make no move as long as 
the estrangement among the three leaders persists. It continues 
to stress the need to reach an understanding and an agreement, 
saying that it will support such an agreement." [passage 
omitted] 
  A leading Lebanese figure who visited Damascus recently says 
that "as the Syrian leadership is preparing to receive 
Christopher -- if the date of the visit is not changed -- it 
refuses to exploit what is happening among its most prominent 
allies in Lebanon, as though it wants to send a message to 
Washington to the effect that it is capable of getting hold of 
the Lebanese card in both thick and thin." 
  The leading Lebanese figure adds: "For this reason, it has 
decided not to intervene to exercise its mediation ability and 
to bring an end to it, lest it is said it is behind the crisis. 
Besides, the regional concern, with which it is preoccupied 
fully, prompts it to control the situation, especially as the 
dispute is among allies." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with former President Amin al-Jumayyil by Kamal </F>
Tarabayh; place and date not given; from the "Today's Guest" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Tarabayh] Your Excellency, how do you view 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's withdrawal ['i'tikaf]? Do you 
support or oppose his demands and preconditions? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] The cabinet crisis is one of the results of 
the 
al-Ta'if agreement. I said at the time that the agreement would 
create confusion in relations among the constitutional bodies; 
that is, the presidency, the prime ministry, and the parliament. 
In any case, the heresy of withdrawal is a novelty. It is not 
mentioned in the new or in the old Lebanese constitutions. 
  [Tarabayh] If you please, Mr. President, it is not so new. 
The late Prime Minister Rashid Karami used to withdraw from 
time to time. 
  [Al-Jumayyil] It is good that you asked this question. 
Karami did not withdraw. He respected the constitution. 
Karami used to resign, tender his resignation. However, for 
certain circumstances--in 1969 during the Cairo agreement, or 
during my administration--it was impossible to form a new 
government for certain national circumstances. Karami would 
remain to perform the duties of the prime minister. Karami's 
stand was constitutional. 
  Today, a new heresy is being created, i.e., withdrawal. The 
least that can be said about it is that it violates the Lebanese 
Constitution. More than that, it is a crime paralyzing 
constitutional establishments. In modern democratic countries, 
a perpetrator of such a crime would be referred to the supreme 
state council. 
  [Tarabayh] This means al-Hariri's withdrawal is a crime, for 
which he should be punished? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] I believe and I insist on saying that this is 
a 
disturbance of the constitutional establishment. As I have 
said, the word withdrawal does not exist in the constitution. 
Prime Minister Karami at the time tendered his resignation to 
President Hilu [in 1969] and then tendered his resignation to 
President al-Jumayyil in 1985. There was a resignation. But 
the heresy of withdrawal, that is, staging a one-man strike, 
playing hard to get, and sitting at home and saying come and beg 
me--this means paralyzing the constitutional bodies. By law and 
by the constitution, this is a crime and a deliberate injury to 
the people's interests. Who commits such a crime must be 
referred to the High Court. 
  [Tarabayh] Let us leave the issue of the withdrawal. 
Al-Hariri presented the view that the Christian, particularly 
the Maronite representation in the government, should be 
defined. He called for appointing at least two ministers 
representing the Phalangist Party and the National Bloc. As a 
Phalangist from outside the party leadership, do you agree to 
Phalangist participation in the government? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] [passage omitted] As in the past, we reject 
the 
prime minister bringing in some employees who cooperate with him 
in his own organizations and appointing them directors and high 
state officials. Now, he is following the same method, 
consecrating this or that as a Maronite leader or a man 
responsible for his community. This is rejected. We want the 
government to continue as it is now, preparatory to the people 
electing their own representatives, and so that the Lebanese 
people--and if you want to use the Christian theme--the 
Christians themselves say who they would like to represent them. 
  [Tarabayh] Would you comment briefly on the detention of the 
dissolved Lebanese Forces party, Samir Ja'ja', and the 
accusations leveled against him, topped by the murder of the 
late Dani Sham'un? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] I do not want to comment on this matter. The 
law will eventually give its verdict. But I demand that justice 
be given to all. We do not want biased justice. We do not want 
two standards before the law. I demand the arrest of the killer 
of my brother, Bashir. The killer is well-known. He is free 
and walking safely and happily on Beirut streets. He admitted 
the murder at the time and confessed who his accomplices were. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Tarabayh] My last question is: You have recently met with 
General Michel 'Awn. What did you talk about? Will you 
participate in the political front which he called for? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] Naturally, he and I consult on current issues 
because we share the same views about nationalist issues and 
consider the situation in Lebanon to be unbearable, in view of 
the current well-known conditions. Together, we are endeavoring 
to organize the work of the opposition and to close ranks in 
order to deal with the current situation, especially in this 
current difficult and historical phase. The entire Middle East 
is now put to the test. The peace conference will define a new 
map for the Middle East region. This map should not be redrawn 
at the expense of Lebanon, its interests, independence, and 
sovereignty. 
  [Tarabayh] Do you make continuous contacts with 'Awn? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] Indubitably. 
  [Tarabayh] What about General Raymond Iddih? 
  [Al-Jumayyil] I hope that the circles of consultations will 
expand to include all the leaderships, including that of Iddih. 
Perhaps the circumstances are not conducive to this now. 
However, we will continue to gather all the sincere leaderships 
which have enough courage to confront the current situation in 
Lebanon. 
  [Tarabayh] Thank you.

  [Text] Ba'labakk, AL-NAHAR--Following a compulsory 
suspension lasting 50 days, Al-Fajr Television, the organ of 
Hizballah in the Ba'labakk region, violated the Cabinet decision 
banning the transmission of political news and programs. 
  Two violations occurred, on Sunday and Monday at 2015, when 
the television broadcast two newscasts. Viewers confirmed that 
the casts contained news of the resistance. But the television 
did not carry the newscast last night, Tuesday, after REUTER 
reported the violations. The newscast was replaced by a film 
about the resistance. 
  This step was taken amid the three-day-old government crisis 
caused by the seclusion of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. 
  Ghassan Darwish, director of Al-Fajr Television, confirmed 
the newscast had resumed but said that the focus was on social, 
cultural, economic, and sports news. 
  The violation in al-Biqa' followed other violations recorded 
in Beirut recently. These included the Phalangist Party's Voice 
of Lebanon, which carried an economic newscast including 
political news, and Hizballah's Al-Manar Television, which 
broadcasts political speeches by men of religion. It is known 
that Al-Mashriq Television is broadcasting Syrian television's 
newscasts while CVN Television broadcasts newscasts by the 
London-based Saudi MBC Television.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah believes that 
Israel will try to make the self-rule a failure with a view to 
turning it into an arena for struggle among the Palestinians. 
He stressed that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations are the most 
complicated because they represent the center of power in the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  Speaking at a Koranic interpretation lesson yesterday, 
Fadlallah said the Israelis demand economic, security, and 
political normalization first. Later they can discuss 
withdrawal and the possibility of delaying it for 10 years. 
During this time, he added, they will wait for any changes that 
might prompt them to back down on that to which they had 
committed themselves. Fadlallah expects the negotiations 
between Syria and Israel to last long, because the enemy does 
not want to reach any positive results with any Arab party 
before weakening it first. Israel, along with the United 
States, wants an Arab or Islamic nation without a will to make 
it easier for them to control the region's economy, politics, 
and security, he noted. 
  Concerning the self-rule agreement, Fadlallah stressed that 
Israel will do its best to make it fail, to stir differences and 
conflicts, and to complicate things for the self-rule 
authorities. He said the Palestinians must be cautious about 
handling their differences so as not to give Israel the chance 
to thwart and undermine self-rule. 
  On the U.S. State Department's charges of terrorism leveled 
against Iran and Syria, Fadlallah said the U.S. Administration 
and some Western states accuse countries with policies not in 
line with or opposed to their own of being terrorist states. 
This accusation applies to any movement that works for 
liberation. Thus we have no respect for the U.S. assessment of 
terrorist movements or countries that support terrorism. He 
added: The United States backs regimes that use terrorism 
against their own people. If we look closer at the U.S. world 
policy we will conclude that the United States is a first-class 
terrorist state. 
  Turning to the war in Yemen, Fadlallah said it is a U.S. 
trap, because Washington's policy is to try to contain any oil 
country. In Yemen's case, this can be achieved only by 
fragmenting it politically, economically, and socially, he added.

  [Excerpts] This evening Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz 
returned to Beirut from South Africa where he was attending the 
inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. In his arrival 
statement, Buwayz said his participation in Mandela's 
inauguration reflects Lebanon's support for the return of 
democracy and genuine representation in South Africa. Here is a 
recording of Minister Buwayz' statement to colleague Darwish 
'Ammar: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] ['Ammar] Mr. Minister, 
it 
is known that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher began a 
new tour of the region. Do you know if he will visit Lebanon? 
What does Lebanon expect from Christopher's tour? 
  [Buwayz] So far, we have not been informed of a possible 
visit to Lebanon by Christopher. We do not expect such a visit. 
I believe that Secretary Christopher is trying to address 
problems related to the Syrian-Israeli track of negotiations. 
As far as I know, his proposals are still somewhat far from 
constituting a genuine and constructive common ground. [end

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 11 May issue 
of Cairo AL-NUR summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Death of a Lawyer 
  2. Dish Antennas 
  3. Fatwas, Veil Controversies 
  4. Al-Azhar Schools 
  5. Ban on Author's Writings Urged 
  6. Al-Azhar Role in Licensing Artistic Productions 
  7. Opinion on Terrorism 
  8. Islamic Council Official Discusses Muslim Ills 
  9. Muslims Worldwide 
<H5>  DEATH OF LAWYER </H5>
  The 11 May issue of AL-NUR leads off with a 1,500-word 
editorial on page 1 by chairman al-Hamzah Di'bis commenting on 
the death in police custody of lawyer 'Abd-al-Haris Madani 
following his arrest on 26 April 1994. The editorial has the 
following Koranic verse as its headline: "In the Law of Equality 
There Is Saving of Life to You, O Ye Men of Understanding That 
Ye May Restrain Yourselves." This verse refers to the death 
penalty that Di'bis urges against "the killer of lawyer 
'Abd-al-Haris Madani." 
  The editorial extols the lawyer's profession as "defending 
righteousness and righteous people and jihad against injustice 
and unjust people" and defends the integrity of Egyptian 
lawyers. It goes on to mention the Egyptian Human Rights 
Committee's suspicions that Madani was tortured while in 
custody, despite official denials. Di'bis praises the late 
President Anwar al-Sadat for ordering a stop to all torture and 
regrets the return of this practice after his death. He urges 
President Husni Mubarak to issue a similar order and reminds him 
that torture is contrary to human rights principles and the 
teachings of Islam. He then calls for the resignation or 
dismissal of Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's government because of the 
incident. 
<H5>  DISH ANTENNAS </H5>
  The second major item on page 1 is a four-column report by 
"AL-NUR's artistic editor" extolling the Saudi Arabian 
Government's decision to ban the private use of satellite dish 
antennas in order to avert the danger that foreign broadcasts 
pose to that Islamic nation. 
  The writer exhorts Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi to 
follow suit but sees little chance that he will do so. He 
praises Damietta Governor Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahim for banning 
satellite dishes in his Governorate and blames AKHBAR AL-YAWM's 
chairman and chief editor Ibrahim Sa'dah for criticizing the 
governor's move. The report criticizes the secular magazine 
ROSE AL-YUSUF for accusing Saudi Arabia of buying off Egyptian 
journalists. 
  A 200-word box on page 3 carries the Saudi mufti's fatwa 
banning dish antennas. 
<H5>  FATWAS, VEIL CONTROVERSIES </H5>
  A 300-word item on page 1 reports on an ongoing lawsuit 
between Egypt's mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi on one side and 
two al-Azhar academics and AL-NUR's chief editor 'Ali Faruq on 
the other. The mufti is accusing Faruq, Professor Shaban 
Muhammad Isma'il, head of al-Azhar's Shari'ah Department, and 
Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, professor of Jurisprudence at Qatar 
University, of slandering him in articles commenting on his 
fatwas on banking transactions, the importation of alcoholic 
beverages for non-Muslims, and opening gambling houses for 
tourists. 
  The court action continues. 
  Another 300-word report on page 1 says that the State 
Council's Administrative Judicial Court has ruled in favor of 
school and university female students who wish to wear the veil, 
contingent on their submission to identity checks by female 
security personnel. 
  A shorter one-column report next to this article indicates 
that the Education Ministry has ordered all school students to 
wear the school uniform and remove the veil. The report says 
some female students are not complying and are not going to 
school. 

<H5>    AL-AZHAR SCHOOLS </H5>
  A 3,500-word report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi on page 3 
discusses the plight of elementary and secondary students in 
al-Azhar institutions -- schools controlled by al-Azhar and 
leading to higher education at al-Azhar University. Various 
al-Azhar academics and administrators say the students' heavy 
workload, involving religious studies and learning the Koran by 
heart in addition to the secular curricula set by the Education 
Ministry, causes high rates of failure and produces students who 
do not know good Arabic. Some educators and administrators say 
that learning the Koran by heart should be left to secondary 
school and university students but AL-NUR disputes this and says 
it is easier for young children to learn the entire Koran. The 
paper urges further state assistance to al-Azhar institutions to 
help overcome the problem. 
<H5>  BAN ON AUTHOR'S WRITINGS URGED </H5>
  On page 3, 'Abd-al-Rasul al-Zaqqani reviews a book entitled 
"A Critique of Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd's Aspersions." The book, 
penned by Professor Isma'il Salim, includes contributions by 
several Al- Azhar academics, who dispute Nasr Abu-Zayd's views 
on the text of the Koran. They call for banning the two books 
in which Abu-Zayd expounds his view that the Koran was a product 
of its era's culture and calls for liberating Muslim minds from 
slavery to religious texts. They say the two books should be 
withdrawn from circulation to Cairo University students. 
  One essay included in "A Critique of Dr. Nasr Hamid 
Abu-Zayd's Aspersions" is written by Dr. Mahmud Mazru'ah, former 
dean of al- Minufiyah's School of Religious Disciplines and the 
Islamic Call; Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Hawwas, assistant professor of 
comparative jurisprudence at al-Azhar University; and two other 
Islamic academics. The essay declares that the authors are not 
accusing Abu-Zayd of apostasy but are urging him to reconsider 
his "dangerous excesses" and "correct his errors." 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR ROLE IN LICENSING ARTISTIC PRODUCTIONS </H5>
  On page 6 AL-NUR carries the 4,500-word "text" of the fatwa 
issued by the General Assembly of the State Council's Fatwa and 
Legislation Department pertaining to the issue of whether the 
Culture Ministry or al-Azhar has authority to license or ban 
artistic audiovisual material. The fatwa, dated 10 February 
1994, is in the form of a letter to the al-Azhar shaykh and is a 
response to an inquiry he sent to the above department on 10 
July 1993. After outlining the pertinent constitutional 
provisions and laws issued over the years in Egypt in connection 
with the dissemination of the material in question, the fatwa 
concludes that the Culture Ministry is the body authorized to 
license or ban artistic audiovisual material when no question of 
Islamic content arises. It notes, however, that when the 
material to be disseminated has an Islamic aspect, al-Azhar has 
a "binding opinion on the Culture Ministry" in connection with 
issuing or withholding a license for such artistic audiovisual 
material. 
<H5>  OPINION ON TERRORISM </H5>
  In the opinion section on page 5, a 600-word article by 
Hasan 
Mukhtar Baghdadi, a pharmacist, says Israeli intelligence 
services are behind terrorist acts in Egypt. They choose as 
perpetrators of these acts people with weak characters and no 
jobs. To fight unemployment, he urges the government to collect 
an alms tax, confiscate the wealth of "drug traffickers, 
low-quality art merchants, bribe takers, and thieves," and 
encourage the investment of Egyptian capital inside the country 
by offering tax breaks. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC COUNCIL OFFICIAL DISCUSSES MUSLIM ILLS </H5>
  In a 2,000-word interview on page 4, Kamil al-Sharif, a 
Jordanian national who is secretary general of the International 
Islamic Council for Call and Relief, ascribes the current ills 
of the Muslim world, including backwardness in comparison with 
other countries, to the lack of Ijtihad in modern times--that 
is, drawing up codes of conduct based on Islamic precedent or 
analogies with Koranic and Sunnah teachings. He says Ijtihad 
was interrupted by centuries of foreign rule and as a result 
modern Muslims are now divided over many issues and do not have 
"a unified understanding or unified view of modern Islam". He 
blames traditions for attributing a lesser role to women than 
Islamic shari'ah actually gives them and calls for 
distinguishing between shari'ah itself and mere traditions. 
  He says many reformers are cautious about addressing this 
point to avoid accusations and suspicion because "there is also 
intellectual terrorism, even among Islamic groups." He warns 
that "erroneous applications" of Koranic or Sunnah texts leads 
to "ignorance, chaos, and fanaticism." 
  Al-Sharif says he believes women can do any job men do 
except 
fill the highest posts of authority. Referring to the important 
roles played by early Muslim women in war, nursing, and even 
Ijtihad, he supports working women and says that the best 
protection of their virtue comes from internal conviction. 
<H5>  MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE </H5>
  AL-NUR publishes on page 2 a 2,000-word interview with the 
mufti of Singapore's Muslim minority. He notes the absence of 
religious persecution in that secular country and speaks of the 
Muslim community's efforts to upgrade the education of its 
children, improve its economic conditions, and build more houses 
of worship. 
  A 1,000-word report on page 2 is entitled "The Hardships of 
Muslims in India". It speaks briefly of "the Muslims' 
persecution by Hindus" who attempt to "exterminate or assimilate 
Kashmir's Muslims." The rest of the report speaks 
disapprovingly of various other religious beliefs and practices 
in India.

  [Text] Doha, 18 May (WAKH)--Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah has set four conditions for beginning a 
cease-fire, namely, recognizing legitimacy and the Constitution, 
resorting to the Constitution, the merger of the Armed Forces' 
units, and the surrender of the southern leaders to the 
legitimate leadership. 
  At a news conference he gave in Doha today at the end of his 
visit to the State of Qatar, the Yemeni minister said that the 
southern leaders' failure to meet these conditions will mean 
their inevitable end. 
  He asserted that secession is impossible, pointing out that 
Yemen will never again return to partition. 
  He added that what is happening is that the Yemeni 
leadership 
is defending legitimacy and the Constitution, adding that the 
legitimate leadership is eager to end the bloodshed, but that 
fighting has been imposed on it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Haqq] In view of the fact that you have 
rejected mediation in the current conflict, what message are you 
carrying for the Arab leaders on your current tour? 
  [Basindwah] Actually, the leaders in some Arab states have 
been influenced by hostile media. The evidence is that they 
view Yemen's unity in the same way as they viewed 
Egyptian-Syrian unity, and they fail to understand that Yemen is 
one country and one people, not two countries and two peoples. 
  Some Arab countries have also been making another mistake in 
that they describe the legitimate forces as the northern forces 
and the rebel forces as the southern forces, but the legitimate 
forces are forces from all over Yemen. The new defense minister 
comes from Abyan Governorate. 
  That is why I must explain to the Arab leaders the 
circumstances and how the fighting started, who started it, and 
how the political crisis in Yemen was a prelude to what is 
taking place now; and also explain that the crisis was 
fabricated in order to achieve peaceful secession, but when that 
failed the "mutineers against constitutional legitimacy" used 
the military card, hoping that Arab states and Arab forces would 
intervene and ask every side to return to its pre-unity 
positions. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] So, on your tour, you are not seeking any 
kind of Arab mediation and you do not want any intervention in 
the current conflict in Yemen. 
  [Basindwah] Arab mediation would be pointless in our 
situation because what is happening now is that the legitimate 
authority is confronting rebel elements. We do not reject any 
endeavor to bring about a cease-fire provided there is adherence 
to international legitimacy and the Constitution, and provided 
the rest of the armed forces return to the legitimate command of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The other side is trying hard and desperately for a 
cease-fire because it knows that its end is near. Anyone who 
believes that what is happening in Yemen is a protracted civil 
war is mistaken. What is now taking place in Yemen is a combing 
operation. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] When the fighting started you said that the 
war would last two or three days. Over 10 days have passed and 
the war is still continuing. How do you explain that? 
  [Basindwah] We have actually discovered that while we were 
preoccupied with our own problems the "secessionist" elements 
were building fortifications in sensitive and important 
locations in the southern governorates in preparation for the 
implementation of their secessionist scheme. 
  Anyway, what has been achieved over the past 10 days 
confirms 
that there has been great progress and that the legitimate 
forces are getting very close to Aden. I believe that the media 
have reflected that in their reports and filming proving that 
the "legitimate forces" are not far from Aden, some being 20 km 
and some 40 km away. 
  As the commander of al-'Amaliqah forces said, these forces 
are waiting for the order to advance on Aden. 
  Ample proof that the "rebel" forces are on their way toward 
surrendering is the fact that their leader announced two days 
ago that he was prepared to abdicate power, which means that he 
is preparing to flee. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] Do you believe that the current fighting 
has eliminated any possibility of dialogue with the Socialist 
Party [YSP] leadership? 
  [Basindwah] I believe that there are some people in the YSP 
leadership and grass roots support unity, and we would welcome 
dialogue and cooperation with them provided they change their 
positions now before it is too late. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] By leadership I meant [Vice President] 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. 
  [Basindwah] Some leaderships are no longer acceptable, not 
even within the YSP. If it were not for the fact that the 
circumstances do not allow some of the party's leaders and grass 
roots to express their views, they would have taken frank and 
specific stands against the party's old leaderships. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle 
Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau [title as published] has 
stated that, in his view, the conflict cannot be settled by 
military means. Do you believe that statement reflects a U.S. 
stance regarding the Yemeni Government? 
  [Basindwah] Pelletreau himself said subsequently that when 
he made that statement he was expressing his own personal 
opinion, not that of the U.S. Administration. 
  When he said that the military solution was not the right 
solution and that there had to be a political solution, he meant 
that political victory required a political solution to 
consolidate it. 
  That is true. When we fight imperialism in any country and 
are triumphant against it, such victory must be crowned with a 
political solution. 
  My understanding of Pelletreau's statement is that he did 
not 
mean that the legitimate forces would not be able to score a 
military victory, but he was emphasizing the need for the 
military victory to be followed by a political solution. That 
stems from the American view of unity as they experienced it 
during the war between the northern and southern states. But I 
believe that the situation in Yemen is different. There are no 
southerners and northerners but only Yemenis divided by 
imperialism and the rule of the imams, Yemenis who can only be 
distinguished by having been born in one governorate or another. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] The eight-point proposal made by the YSP 
leadership has been received with Arab understanding. Is there 
any possibility on your part of accepting all or part of that 
proposal. 
  [Basindwah] People alien to Yemen who do not know the 
realities of Yemen may show understanding of the proposal. At 
any rate, some of these proposals are obsolete and no longer 
valid. I believe that the best thing the "mutiny leadership" 
could do is surrender to constitutional legitimacy to ensure 
that it gets a fair trial, because I do not believe that the 
Yemeni people would accept elements involved in the fighting, 
and there is no possibility of dealing with them. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] A cease-fire is a priority for all the Arab 
states making efforts to settle the conflict in Yemen. In what 
circumstances would you accept a cease-fire? 
  [Basindwah] We do not insist on a continuation of the 
shooting, but we will not agree to a cease-fire that would 
rehabilitate the "mutineering and renegade elements" or that 
would lead to the destruction of Yemeni unity. It must be 
understood that Yemeni unity is there to stay and no power can 
turn the wheel back. Yemen's unity goes on despite the 
suffering. Our people have a right to be united and to unite 
their homeland. I do not believe that this is too much to ask. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] It has been claimed that the Yemeni forces in 
the north have received military aid from abroad, particularly 
from Iraq, and that some elements have been captured. What is 
your reply to that? 
  [Basindwah] My reply to that is that a few days ago we 
received a memorandum from the Iraqi ambassador in Sanaa saying 
that Aden forces arrested some sailors of two tankers held at 
Aden since the Gulf crisis after the sanctions were imposed on 
Iraq. Of course, we could do nothing to release these people, 
who have been presented as Iraqi elements fighting alongside 
government forces. That is a fabricated story and is not the 
first story to be fabricated by the media of the "renegade" 
elements. They have claimed that there are some Sudanese too, 
but we challenge them to produce a single one of those. 
  Let me give you another example of the false claims made by 
the mutineers' media to win the sympathy of the Arab states. 
Three months ago, during the political crisis, I received a 
message from Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa asking me to 
work for the release of a number of Islamic Jihad members and 
hand them over to Egypt. He said that they were arrested in 
al-Marrakishah area in Abyan Governorate and that Aden's former 
governor, Salih Munsir al-Musayri, said that he was holding 
them. The Egyptian ambassador brought the message, whereupon I 
immediately asked brother Yahya al-Mutwakkil, the interior 
minister, to draft a clear memorandum to the former Aden 
governor asking him to hand these people over to Egypt. 
  The Yemeni consul [as published] indeed took the interior 
minister's memorandum to the former governor of Aden, only to 
discover that there were no such members of the said 
organization and that the aim of that fabricated story was to 
set Egypt against us. 
  I raised this matter during my recent meeting with President 
Husni Mubarak. That was confirmed in my presence by Ambassador 
Badr Hammam, the Egyptian assistant foreign minister, who 
verified that the entire story was false and that its aim was to 
drive a wedge between us and Egypt. 
  ['Abd-al-Haqq] You met in Damascus with [former South Yemen 
President] 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, and it has been claimed that you 
offered him a post in the Yemeni Government. 
  [Basindwah] That is not true. I did not offer him anything 
and I did not discuss any such topics with him at all. 
  I visited him in the company of brother Faruq al-Sahr', the 
Syrian foreign minister, and the reason was that he was in 
hospital. I had no offer to make and I had no authorization to 
make any offer.

<F P=106> [Communique "No. 21" issued by the Ministry of Defense on 17 </F>
May; place not given] 
  [Text] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih yesterday sent large numbers of 
barbaric forces with their vehicles into a deadly battle in a 
desperate attempt to break through the fortified defense of the 
Armed Forces. These forces, together with the masses of our 
people, are defending justice, freedom, and honor. This was 
preceded by false statements, such as those of al-Ansi and 
al-Iryani, that the barbaric forces advanced behind a human 
shield [words indistinct] into a deadly battle. 
  Our armed forces repulsed these forces by striking heavy 
blows on them on the fronts of al-Karish, Abyan, Qa'tabah, and 
Bayhan during which many of them surrendered, while the remnants 
(?fled) toward Qa'tabah, al-Rahidah, and al-Bayda with our 
forces still behind them. Our forces captured many arms and 
vehicles abandoned by the oppressors.

  [Text] An official in the Ministry of Defense denied 
absolutely the claims that the forces of the bloody and 
adventurous al-Ahmar family gang had seized the al-'Anad 
military base. It also denied that any unit of the forces of 
unity, democracy, and modernization, or any of their members, 
had surrendered as alleged by the military sources in Sanaa. 
The official source in the Ministry of Defense confirmed that 
the forces of unity, democracy, and modernization are waging 
heroic defensive battles toward Karish and al-Rahidah, and are 
achieving sweeping victories, about which we are not boasting as 
is the information media of the criminal al-Ahmar family. It is 
our intention, however, to confirm to our Yemeni people, the 
Arab public, and the world that we are waging a battle of 
defense against [as heard] our people's dignity, their honor, 
and their right to a free and dignified life.

  [Text] Mr. Ahmad Yahya Muthanna, the assistant na'ib 
[official administrator] in al-Shu'ayb center in al-Dali 
District in Lahij Governorate, called on the local and foreign 
journalists to come to al-Shu'ayb center to see the effects of 
the random, barbaric shelling of the center by the gang of the 
al-Ahmar family, and to give a true and natural picture at the 
local, Arab, and world levels for all to know the truth. 
  In his statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA', he mocked 
the allegations of the al-Ahmar family gang, which claims that 
its forces had occupied the center. He indicated that the 
citizens of the center appealed to the Arab world and the world 
community to intervene, to treat and save the lives of those 
wounded due to that random shelling. He emphasized that the 
citizens of the center are adhering to the unity and democracy 
and their rejection of the dictatorship and the domination of 
the individual and the family over the authority, as well as 
adherence of the citizens of the center to the implementation of 
the pledge and accord document and ending the infighting and the 
investigation into those who started it, as well as peace and 
stability shall (?return) to Yemen. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] An official military spokesman at the Defense 
Ministry has issued the following statement: 
  Pursuant to our statement released yesterday [17 May] 
morning 
about units of the valiant Armed Forces in the 
al-'Anad-al-Hawtah sector completing their combat duties by 
completely destroying the military base at al-'Anad, as well as 
the fortifications, formations, and weapons stored there, and 
the seizure and transfer to Constitutional legitimacy of the 
balance of a variety of military hardware stacked there, and the 
mounting morale of the heroic knights in our Armed Forces, other 
duties and goals were completed in all the axes and sectors: 
  The forces championing unity and Constitutional legitimacy 
in 
that sector advanced to confront the secessionist, rebellious 
forces. They reached the al-Halilayn Subdistrict in Radfan 
District and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of apostasy 
and secession in equipment and field weapons. They seized four 
tanks and two BM-21 and two 130-mm howitzers, one 
double-barreled gun and eight trucks. 
  The air defense forces shot down two helicopters, capturing 
one pilot. 
  On the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of unity, democracy, and 
Constitutional legitimacy continued their advance with firmness 
and capability. They absorbed the fire of various weapons of 
the forces of rebellion and secession who joined the rest of the 
retreating brigades facing their inevitable fate. The forces of 
unity and Constitutional legitimacy are boldly confronting the 
fire and bombardment of the naval units of the forces of 
apostasy and secession and aborting their aggressive goals. 
  The valiant eagles of the Air Forces today continued the 
execution of their combat and offensive duties in a number of 
the arenas of battle, scoring direct hits against their set 
targets, with all the planes returning safely to base. 
  As the deserved end of the elements of apostasy and 
rebellion 
and secession in the great battles of the triumph of right over 
wrong and the defeat of all the delusions of the separatists and 
their rancor for the blessed Yemeni land approaches, we 
reiterate the call to all officers, non-commissioned officers, 
and soldiers of the military units that are still under the 
domination of the sinful secessionist forces in Aden Governorate 
to hasten to seize the valuable national opportunity open to 
them today by disobeying the aggressive instructions of the 
forces of rebellion and secession and disengaging themselves 
from the trap of the heinous crime plotted by the rebellious 
separatists against the homeland, the people, unity, and 
democracy. We call on them to return to their senses and their 
generous and noble posts within the ranks of the proud Armed 
Forces -- the forces of the people and the homeland, and they 
will find complete understanding of their coerced conditions and 
circumstances. They will even receive the kind of estimation 
and respect worthy of the noble act of stemming the flow of the 
blood and protecting achievements.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abd-al-Malik Mansur, head of the </F>
political and foreign relations department at the Yemeni General 
People's Congress, in Sanaa, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo, 
on the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] How can the Yemenis emerge from the 
crisis and protect their unity, resources, and achievements? 
  [Mansur] First, I would like to thank you for contacting us 
to seek reassurance about conditions in our country. 
  What is happening in the Yemeni arena today is the last 
chapter, not the beginning, of the crisis. Things were settled 
democratically in Yemen; the Yemeni people elected their 
representatives in public elections, which were clean, as 
certified by the organizations that supervised them. The 
elections elected people's representatives to parliament, which 
freely elected a presidential council ... 
  [Abu-al-Majd interrupts] We do not want to discuss the past. 
We are trying to find a solution that stops the bloodletting. 
How can we do that? 
  [Mansur] Yes, this is possible. It is what we hope and work 
for. No rational or civilized person would choose war. We 
neither opted to fight nor sought to wage a war. But we welcome 
any peaceful initiative in the context of recognizing 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] You say you welcome any peaceful settlement. 
The Arab League put forward a peaceful settlement to end the 
bloodshed. You reportedly did not accept that initiative. Why? 
  [Mansur] We accept no mediation based on the idea that there 
are two equal parties in the arena. If a mediation effort 
admits that there is a legitimate government based on parliament 
and the Constitution and that seeks to reconcile parties, it is 
welcome to that. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But some say the military option will take 
time. So the bloodletting will continue. Even if the situation 
is settled in your favor militarily, this will create hatred in 
hearts and trigger more bloodletting. 
  [Mansur] We are optimistic. We expect the future to be 
bright and to bring much good for the Yemeni people, the 
neighboring region, and the entire Arab people. We do not think 
the future will be one of vengeance and bloodletting. No wise 
man chooses war as an approach. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Why do you not sit with them now through Arab 
mediation--by the Arab League, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, 
or others--to make things clearer and stop the bloodshed? 
  [Mansur] This is a wise thought. That is exactly what we 
did. We have sat with them 1,001 times since the beginning of 
the crisis. We got together in Jordan in the presence of His 
Majesty King Husayn and we signed a document named the Pledge 
and Accord Document ... 
  [Abu-al-Majd interrupts] Why do you not try again one last 
time? 
  [Mansur] Only an irrational person rejects reconciliation. 
But man reconciles with people who accept reconciliation. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But the Socialist Party people say they accept 
reconciliation. Do we understand from this that you have chosen 
the military option and, if so, why do you send envoys to Arab 
states? 
  [Mansur] I would like to say that a political decision is 
delaying the entry of the legitimate army to Aden. The brother 
president does not want to devastate Aden, because he loves its 
people and sympathizes with them. That is why he might throw a 
siege around it. The envoys being sent to Arab leaders are part 
of bilateral consultations; they brief our brothers on the 
situation in our country. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Some say unity cannot be imposed by the force 
of weapons. 
  [Mansur] This is true. Our unity was established peacefully 
by consensus and consent on 22 May 1990. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think the Pledge and Accord Document 
can 
still guarantee the continuation of unity after resorting to the 
military option? 
  [Mansur] The document retains the necessary elements for 
success and survival although it needs to be developed and 
reviewed in light of new developments. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Thank you. 
  [Mansur] Thank you.

  [Text] Council of Ministers Chairman Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas met Mr. Pelletreau, the Assistant State Secretary for 
Near East Affairs at the U.S. State Department yesterday. They 
discussed the grave developments in our country and the 
continued barbaric attacks led by the military leadership in 
control in Sanaa against the people of the southern and eastern 
provinces. 
  Prime Minister al-'Attas reviewed the peace initiative 
proposed by the Yemeni Socialist Party and the principles for 
national salvation accord proposed by the nationalist forces 
which were both rejected along with other political initiatives 
by the leadership in Sanaa. 
  The U.S. official expressed the U.S. Administration's 
satisfaction with and welcome of this initiative stressing his 
country's keen interest in stopping the war. He pointed out 
that whatever the result of the war is, it cannot be a solution 
to the current political problems. It will rather lead to more 
ruin, destruction, and victims and will create hatred and 
bitterness and expose the union to danger.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab 
League envoy to Yemen and Arab League assistant secretary 
general for military affairs, and members of his delegation 
returned to Cairo this afternoon following a visit of several 
days to Yemen. 
  During the visit, the Arab League delegation met with Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and a number of Yemeni leaders in 
a bid to stop the bloodshed in Yemen. 
  In his arrival statement at Cairo airport, Bayraqdar said 
that he had conveyed to the Yemeni president the Arab League's 
appeal to end the fighting and to begin a dialogue. He said 
that the Arab League delegation also met with Deputy Prime 
Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Alfi and members of the Presidential 
Council and reiterated the Arab League's concern for the 
consequences if the fighting continues. The delegation urged the 
two sides to halt fighting. 
  Bayraqdar pointed out that the officials in Sanaa had 
explained to him the causes that led to the outbreak of 
fighting, the efforts made by President Salih before the war, 
and the current circumstances. He said that he conveyed a 
message from the Arab League secretary general to the Yemeni 
president, urging him to end the fighting and to pave the way 
for dialogue. 
  The Arab League envoy noted the results of his talks with 
the 
Yemeni president showed that Salih cannot accept a cease-fire 
for the time being, particularly after the clashes and fighting 
between the two armed forces. Bayraqdar said that the Yemeni 
president told him halting the fighting is contingent upon 
several conditions, including the recognition of the 
constitutional legitimacy, the safeguarding of the Yemeni 
peoples' unity and land, the safeguarding of the unity of the 
army, and the merger of the army. The Yemeni president, 
according to the Arab League envoy, stressed that a cessation of 
fighting is currently ruled out unless those responsible for it 
are arrested, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the prime minister, 
and eight leading members of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
  In his statement, Bayraqdar said that the Yemeni president 
maintained that he will not accept any Arab initiative, not even 
by the Arab League, until the perpetrators, whether 
secessionists or others, are identified. Therefore, the Arab 
governments must deal with the constitutional Yemeni Government. 
  The Arab League assistant secretary general said that during 
the lengthy talks, the Yemeni president stressed that either the 
perpetrators surrender and stand trial so that those responsible 
for the outbreak of the events are identified, or they leave 
Aden for any Arab or foreign country as they wish. 
  The Yemeni president again expressed his thanks to the Arab 
League secretary general and the League Council for their good 
offices.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Afaf Zayn] </F>
  [Excerpts] London -- As 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
assistant secretary general of the General People's Congress and 
Presidential Council member, was telling journalists in Sanaa 9 
May that fighting had stopped at all axes in the Abyan 
Governorate in the south of the country and that the military 
situation had been decided in favor of pro-government forces 
"poised to complete their tasks by entering Aden within 48 
hours", 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] was telling AL-WASAT on the line from his 
Aden residence that "they will enter Aden over our dead bodies." 
He was emphatic that the Army brigades in what used to be known 
as Southern Yemen before the merger "would soon shift from their 
defensive to an offensive posture," after the intensive bombing 
had failed to achieve its objectives. 
  Contradicting 'Abd-al-Ghani's contention that the fighting 
"was about to be settled in favor of the legal forces against 
the separatists in the YSP, al-Bid told AL-WASAT "the military 
situation" had not been decided in favor of the forces under the 
man (President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih) who made the insane 
decision to set off the explosion. Arab and world opinion can 
now better judge the kind of practices we have endured over the 
three and one-half years that the merger lasted. He drew a 
parallel between "the military option President Salih had been 
planning before the signing of the accord document in Amman and 
the illegal appointments and dismissals and Saddam Husayn's 
decisions following the invasion of Kwuait and his dismissal and 
replacement of the Kuwaiti government." [passage omitted] 
  With escalating hostilities, the political situation in 
Sanaa 
and Aden continues to be ambiguous. According to Salim Salih 
Muhammad, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih opted for the military 
option once he realized that under a regime of political 
pluralism following 14 years of totalitarian rule, he had lost 
many of his privileges. Driven by a tribal mentality, he put the 
fate of the country on the line, equating himself with the state 
and the army. It is this kind of mentality that destroyed the 
union. His lending his ear to certain YSP officials, who were 
closer to his way of thinking since the proclamation of unity, 
propels the "conspiracy theory". That conclusion is echoed by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, who says: "Yes, there is a conspiracy." 
  What does this conspiracy seek to achieve? Al-Bid replies 
that the aim is to set up in the region a theocratic entity 
built on the alliance between the military and the fundamenalist 
establishments. "It is the military fundamentalist state of 
Sudan, along the lines of which other such regimes are being 
planned," asserts al-Bid. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice president of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party Central Committee, proceeded on an inspection 
tour of military units this morning in the eastern area, during 
which he met military and political leaders. The military 
forces of unity and democracy there are conducting decisive 
military confrontations with the forces of the separatist gang 
of the al-Ahmar clan. 
  A responsible source at the political bureau has told the 
Yemeni news agency, SABA', that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid made 
the tour in implementation of the resolution adopted by the 
political bureau that party members and leaders should tour the 
various axes following 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's rejection of all 
the national, Arab, and international initiatives and appeals to 
stop the bloody war he declared against the Yemeni people. 
Salih is targeting the southern and eastern governorates, 
thereby causing the destruction of towns, villages, and 
installations, violating homes and causing the deaths of 
citizens in the areas his forces have entered. This leaves the 
forces of unity and democracy with no alternative but to 
confront those forces, which have transformed unity into a 
bloody struggle. Full historic responsibility is borne by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih for this disaster being suffered by Yemen and 
its sons. It was he who during these blessed days decided to 
transform the joy of the sons of the Yemen attending the blessed 
id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of unity on 22 May into 
days of grief.

  [Text] In these critical and grave moments in the history 
of our people in which towns and villages are destroyed, lives 
lost, children orphaned, women widowed, and the hopes and 
aspirations of our people for unity, security, stability, and 
progress sacrificed, and when full blows are being dealt to 
democracy with the aim of enshrining the hegemony of forces 
hostile to the people and their aspirations to build modern 
Yemen in the light of the documents of pledge and accord, the 
patriotic opposition bloc announced a salvation initiative on 9 
May, which is summarized here as follows: 
  1. The immediate cessation of all war operations. 
  2. The cancellation of all government institutions 
because of their inability to solve the crisis and to prevent 
the catastrophe. 
  3. To speed up the formation of a national salvation 
government so as to enable it to save the country from the deep 
abyss. 
  4. The salvation government is to undertake the 
application of the pledge and accord document which has won 
national consensus, a matter that is unprecedented in the life 
of our people. 
  5. The salvation government is to undertake the 
investigation and exposure of those who caused the crime of 
in-fighting and to present them for trial. 
  6. To oppose any side which refuses this initiative which 
seeks to save our people and our country and to end this 
destruction. 
  The dialogue commission outside the coalition announced its 
initiative on 30 April which is summarized in the cancellation 
of the institutions of the existing authority and the formation 
of a national salvation government. This followed the events of 
'Imran which led to this overall disaster. This was then 
followed by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] initiative on 12 
May, when it stated its agreement with and acceptance of the 
initiative of the patriotic opposition bloc, and responded to it. 
  Consequently, any opposition or rejection of these 
initiatives must be considered as opposition to the Yemeni 
national consensus. The patriotic and democratic forces 
represented by the political parties and organizations which 
signed this declaration defined the bases of their moves as 
cooperation and standing in one trench to achieve those 
patriotic initiatives which seek to end the bloodshed and the 
machinery destroying our people, their unity, and land. They 
continue to hope that reason and Yemeni wisdom will prevail and 
that all honorable people will rally to this initiative 
throughout Yemen, in all political organizations, as well as the 
older men of reason in the parties of the authority which has 
not responded to the initiative of the patriotic national 
opposition. 
  These patriotic forces represent by this responsible stand a 
basis for a responsible patriotic and democratic alliance 
relying on the pledge and accord document to continue the 
struggle to save the homeland from the destructive war, to 
preserve unity, and to build a modern state on the basis of the 
following concepts and commitments: 
  1. The objective we are striving to achieve is the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document. 
  2. The machinery to implement the document has already been 
stated in the initiative of the patriotic opposition bloc on 9 
May and the dialogue commission outside the coalition on 30 
April, and the YSP through its initiative of 12 May, namely a 
national salvation government which reflects national unity and 
widespread participation in the building of the nation on the 
foundations of democracy as a firm option from which there can 
be no retreat. 
  3. We are committed to the pledge and accord document and to 
work for its implementation with all honorable and wise people, 
wherever we are able to do so in the land of Yemen. 
  4. We are irrevocably committed to democracy based on 
multipartyism and peaceful alternation of authority. 
  5. We all pledge and are committed, as far as we are able, 
to condemn any manifestations of authoritarianism in government 
or any manifestations by an individual, party or group of 
attempts to control the instruments of authority anywhere in 
Yemen. 
  6. We pledge and are committed to the equality of 
opportunity in political action without the tyranny of one group 
over another or of one region over another region or of one 
party over others. Government institutions, resources, and tools 
should not be run for the benefit of any particular group, party 
or tribe. 
  7. Opportunity should be made available to all national 
and capable patriotic cadres regardless of their party or 
regional affiliation in all fields and at all levels. 
  8. The homeland belongs to all. All are partners in both 
good and bad times. The responsibility for its protection, 
defense, the safety of its sons and ending this catastrophe, 
belongs to all. All political forces committed to this national 
salvation initiative document are equal in rights and duties. 
  9. We are all committed to cooperating in order to eliminate 
the vestiges of the far and near past, to soothe the wounds and 
to eliminate these vestiges from people's minds through 
national, historic reconciliation which would restore everyone's 
rights, guarantee justice and equality, and sow the seeds of 
love and brotherhood. 
  10. To work for the elimination of the effects of division 
in people's minds through parity in communication, balancing of 
interests between groups, governorates and provinces, and the 
rejection of all attempts to sow hatred and malice. We must 
rise above any narrow regional, sectarian, divisive or partisan 
tendencies. 
  11. We do not support those who advocate war, in-fighting, 
division or secession. However, we shall confront with all 
honorable people the mentality which desires the continuation of 
killings and destruction and refuses to silence its guns. 
  The continuation of the [word indistinct] stubborn refusal 
to 
stop the massacres and destruction will increase our 
determination to mobilize all the energies of our people to 
confront the perpetrators of the catastrophe and the destructive 
war. The democratic forces are capable of doing this with 
reason, wisdom, and real democratic work and by the application 
of parity in communication and equilibrium which will take care 
of all the sons of our people. 
  12. On the basis of commitment by us all to the pledge and 
accord document, the document of national consensus, and on the 
basis of the fact that we constitute a foundation for an 
extensive, democratic and national alliance, we all agree to 
form joint machineries which will lead, manage, and supervise 
all affairs, relations, actions and activities. None of us will 
take a unilateral decision. The proper machineries for this 
will be formed to represent all and to lead all activities with 
the aim of attaining a government of national salvation and the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document. 
  The political parties and organizations signing this 
agreement warn of the consequences of ignoring this agreement 
which is aimed at saving the homeland and safeguarding the land 
and people of Yemen. It is a natural culmination of all 
previous political initiatives. 
  We appeal to the rest of the political parties and 
organizations participating in the dialogue commission to play 
their full role by taking part in all the machineries of this 
agreement. God knows our intentions. 
  Signed by: The Patriotic Opposition Bloc [al-Takattul 
al-Watani lil-Mu'aradah), the Nasirite Unionist Popular 
Organization [al-Tanzim al-Wahdawi al-Sha'bi al-Nasiri], the 
Party of the League of the Sons of Yemen, [Hizb Rabitat Abna 
al-Yaman, RAY], the Union of the Patriotic Forces [Ittihad 
al-Quwa al-Sha'biyah], the Yemeni Unionist Alliance Party [Hizb

  [Text] The destiny of and the belief in Yemeni unity 
continues to capture the feelings of Yemenis. It is an 
irrevocable fate. It is an objective we achieved after struggle 
and a long wait. The objective of unity has been realized and 
has achieved victory. It is now becoming firm and strong, 
deeply rooted in hearts and the land. Unity is spreading 
through time. How can we say no, while we watch the unionist 
heroes from the forces of unity and legitimacy brand unity with 
sweat, effort, steadfastness, and the unionists' march forward? 
We see the unionist citizens welcoming them with joy and 
support, united with them in all love and appreciation, and with 
all joy and belief in unity. We witnessed this in al-Dali', 
Abyan, Lahij, and other places. They are scenes that prove a 
belief in unity and a concern about it continuing, regardless of 
sacrifices and no matter how much the gangs of apostasy and 
secession try to harm it or hide from its overwhelming light in 
the burrows of apostasy, the dens of secession, and the 
labyrinths of their wicked conspiracy. 
  With the amazing and delightful scenes that shine with the 
brightness of unity and love for it and faith in it, we hear 
support and see the rallying around Constitutional legitimacy 
and unionist leadership. We hear it, with satisfaction and 
peace of mind, in the cable from the people of al-Dali' to 
President Leader Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces. This cable disproves and silences all claims 
by the horns of apostasy and secession and puts their feet back 
in their mouths. The cable throws a stone at the secessionists 
and defies the evils of the secessionists. It is a cable that 
radiates with a right that cannot be avoided. It follows the 
road that cannot be changed and seeks to achieve the same 
objective we have. 
  Perhaps what makes the issue deeper and clearer are the 
statements by the citizens to the Yemeni Television cameras, 
expressing their joy about the defeat of the positions of 
apostasy, removing the traces of secession, destroying the dens 
of partitioning, and defeating the remnants of the losing 
secessionist conspiracy, whose price has been paid. 
  The citizens' words express their belief in unity and their 
adherence to it as an objective, a fate, and a hope that all the 
good people of Yemen sought to achieve. There is no argument 
that the leadership that believes in Yemeni unity and is the 
representative of Constitutional legitimacy expressed the hopes 
of the citizens and translated the feelings of all the people. 
It did so when President Leader Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
supreme commander of the Armed forces, instructed the minister 
of defense to destroy all the positions that are linked to 
partitioning, or show signs of it, and to erase all traces of 
division and separation between the one Yemeni land and the one 
people. Yes, they are instructions that express the feelings of 
every Yemeni, translates his will and shows his fate. 
Therefore, the unionist forces along with the unionist masses 
in all areas embarked on destroying all these traces based on 
Salih's instructions. They translated these instruction into a 
tangible reality, out of their faith that this is right and is 
what the people want. All signs, events, actions, stands, and 
words show without any doubt that unity is rooted in the depths 
of the hearts and land, and is spreading through time. It will 
continue to reap its benefits everywhere and at all 
times--benefits that will not stop. The people will enjoy its 
benefits every time and will persistently defend its generosity 
in any circumstance. 
  How can we say no, when unity is the greater objective and 
the irrevocable fate? It is the dream we achieved through 
sacrifices and struggle and through the perseverance and faith 
of the heroic men -- men who fulfilled what they had promised. 
They achieved the promise and lived up to the pledge, They gave 
birth to unity for all Yemen from the depths of time on the 
great day of 22 May. Here are the sons of all Yemen continuing 
to care for, protect, and defend it with all love, sincerity, 
faith and insistence, despite the gangs of apostasy and 
secession. 
  Therefore, we are sure that the parasites of the gangs of 
secessionism will be uprooted from the land, God willing. 
Moreover, the apostasy will be disintegrated by the brightness 
of the sun of unity. God is with right and its people and with 
unity and those who protect it. God supports those who are 
sincere and faithful, defeats the liars and renegades, and 
destroys those who defy God's will and deviate from the masses' 
consensus. 
  Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? A goodly word 
like a goodly tree whose root is firmly fixed and its branches 
reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, 
by the leave of its lord. So God sets forth parables for men, 
in order that they may receive admonition. And the parable of an 
evil word is that of an evil tree. It is torn up by the root 
from the surface of the Earth. It has no stability. God will 
establish in strength those who believe, with the word that 
stands firm, in this world and in the hereafter; but God will 
leave, to stray, those who do wrong; God does what he wills. 
[Koranic verse]

  [Text] The Constitutional legitimacy's military is the 
property of the immortal Republic of Yemen; it is the military 
of unified Yemen; it is the military that has been immunized by 
loyalty to God, the homeland, and the revolution. As such, the 
Army is the party to which our Yemeni masses naturally turn when 
they seek to hasten the inevitable end of the cheap separatists' 
saga, led by the war criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his 
renegade, perfidious gang. 
  That hope is reflected by the worthy citizens in our 
southern 
governorates rallying behind the army of legality, democracy, 
and unity. That all-important moral support has enabled our 
valiant Army to fulfill its patriotic duties with remarkable 
success and efficiency and score successive victories over the 
forces of apostasy and secession and pursue the sacred advance 
on the remnants of apostasy, perfidy, and treachery. 
  The unsavory rumors spread by the gang of secession within 
the Socialist Party about the army of legality, unity, and 
democracy furnish eloquent proof of the panic with which it 
reacted to the support the victorious Republic of Yemen's 
military enjoys with the public. It is not surprising that our 
great Yemeni people should stand shoulder to shoulder with the 
courageous protectors of the homeland as they defend the 
sanctities of the Yemeni homeland. Just as the Yemeni people 
displayed exemplary sacrifice in defeating their enemy in 
conjunction with the military, they are now striving to rout the 
remnants of the enemies of legality, unity, and democracy. 
  This courageous pro-Army and pro-unity posture on the part 
of 
our determined people has dealt a stinging blow to the gang of 
apostasy and secession. It was natural that the people should 
take such a stand, given the gang's criminal bloody record. 
  Certain facts have now come to light and may be summed up as 
follows: 
  The personnel of the Republic of Yemen's military, now 
engaging the secessionist gang in battle for the cause of 
legality and unity and democracy, hail from all the Republic's 
governorates, without exception. Thus, every inch of Yemeni 
territory is a trust held by all members of the Armed Forces. A 
Yemeni views every Yemeni drop of blood that runs through the 
veins of fellow Yemenis as if it were his own. 
  The Republic of Yemen's military has earned the support of 
the entire population of the country by its loyalty to God, the 
homeland, the revolution, and unity. 
  Our enlightened and vigilant people are now certain that the 
leaders of secession in the Socialist Party stage-managed the 
crisis to advance their goal of scuttling the union of the 
country and then reinstating their terrible, totalitarian regime 
in the south. 
  Monitoring the evolving crisis from the beginning, Yemenis 
are now certain beyond a shadow of doubt that the secessionist 
gang had been planning for secession for quite some time. 
Toward that end, they had detached some military units from the 
Army of the Yemeni Republic. With their rallying cries of power 
or death, secession or war, they had also stacked weapons and 
military hardware in homes and warehouses and even with some 
street hawkers. 
  That was enough [word indistinct] all people with their 
heroic Army that has proved its true affiliation to a united 
Yemen, thus haunting the secessionists, who are now spreading 
ludicrous rumors to undercut the cohesion between the people and 
the Army as they push ahead with the firmness of believers to 
uphold the cause of unity, democracy, and legality and hunt down 
the adventurous killers -- the gang of apostasy and secession, 
who are now having to endure the disgrace of defeat. Yemen's 
unity shall remain a crown on the heads of our worthy citizens 
and their victorious army, God willing.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin, place not given, by Rafi Rosenfeld from the "It Is All 
Talk" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Rosenfeld] Good morning, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin. 
  [Beilin] Good morning. 
  [Rosenfeld] 'Arafat says in a recording that there is a 
secret document containing an Israeli pledge to discuss the 
status of Jerusalem within three years of the interim 
arrangement. And yet, despite the commotion which followed the 
report, his remarks do not disclose anything. 
  [Beilin] It is a joke. There is a non-secret document, 
which says something in this spirit. 
  [Rosenfeld] The Declaration of Principles, I believe. 
  [Beilin] Yes. I heard the tape, and it is quite silly. It 
may be okay for a mosque speech, but I would not advise you to 
take it seriously in terms of the truth, particularly since the 
letter story is a joke. The Oslo agreement states that within 
two years at most -- not three, he confused his dates there -- 
we should start negotiations, with Jerusalem as one of the 
issues on the agenda. 
  [Rosenfeld] Let us now address another aspect of the tape -- 
the call for jihad. The prime minister said: If 'Arafat has 
indeed called for jihad, the future of the peace process is in 
doubt. What does he mean, if 'Arafat indeed called for jihad? 
You heard the tape, as we all have, and he did call for jihad. 
  [Beilin] Yes, he said: We have to continue the jihad, it is 
a matter for you more than us, and to prove my point, I even 
asked for a letter to support it. What can I tell you? Those 
who always attached great significance to 'Arafat's 
pronouncements, will take a very grave view of this. It is not 
that I am taking it lightly, but I have never attached great 
significance to his utterances. I think his remarks about jihad 
will discredit him in public opinion throughout the world. 
These remarks will not be able to stop the negotiations, but 
they are definitely not something we can shrug off, and they 
will cost 'Arafat more than anyone else. 
  [Rosenfeld] The question is whether we will not pay with 
victims. 
  [Beilin] No, I do not think an actual call for jihad against 
Israel was made in South Africa. I think his entire speech 
there was ridiculous, and this part of the speech looks 
ridiculous to me, too. I do not perceive any change in 
'Arafat's policy. I will see it as a violation of the agreement 
if, God forbid, actual orders to attack Israel or to disregard 
some clauses of the agreement are given, or if elements 
connected with 'Arafat carry out terrorist operations. That 
would definitely be a grave violation of the agreement, and if 
it happens, the agreement will have no future. [passage omitted] 
  [Rosenfeld] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, Minister 
Shulamit Aloni told our correspondent this morning that perhaps 
we should look for new partners. 
  [Beilin] I am all for it. If she manages to find new 
partners, I am certain she will inform me, too, and then we will 
launch negotiations with the new partners. 
  [Rosenfeld] In other words, you are saying that past 
experience shows there are no other partners. 
  [Beilin] There are none, but if someone can find a partner 
better than 'Arafat, I will not fight for 'Arafat's right to 
continue negotiating with us at any cost. I think we would all 
be happy if we could conduct negotiations with someone who could 
both represent the Palestinian people and present stands that 
are more compatible with ours. I regret to say I do not know of 
any such person. We waited for 26 years, and thank God, we are 
now leaving Gaza, we are beginning the peace process, and we are 
to have an entirely different Middle East in spite of the 
foolish things 'Arafat occasionally says. It is no use: Those 
who would like to use his utterances to stop the negotiations, 
are bound to fail. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Minister Shulamit Aloni says 'Arafat's call for 
jihad against Israel is ludicrous. In her opinion, his remarks 
are an extravaganza stemming from profound frustration at having 
achieved less than he had wanted, or perhaps from a dread of 
coping with reality while living in fantasy. 
  Interviewed by a Qol Yisra'el correspondent this morning, 
Minister Aloni said the peace process would continue, and even 
'Arafat would not be able to jeopardize it, because the 
Palestinian people want peace. If he continues daydreaming and 
does not withdraw his remarks, Israel may take time out and 
possibly pursue negotiations with other members of the 
Palestinian leadership -- serious, level-headed people 
representing the Palestinian people, with whom we have become 
acquainted in the course of the negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report by Hayim Hecht -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Hecht] One hour after Qol Yisra'el carried the 
story on 'Arafat's address, a motion of no-confidence in the 
government was filed with the Knesset secretariat. Yitzhaq 
Levi, National Religious Party [NRP] secretary general, said: 
If you want to know the truth, do not trust the Israeli 
Government; listen to 'Arafat's remarks. The NRP faction held a 
special meeting and decided to file a motion of no confidence. 
  Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Moshe Peled said that he exposed 
the fact that the Cairo agreements include five secret addenda 
three weeks ago. They said I am mad, Peled said. The five 
addenda, according to Peled, refer to: the Palestinian right of 
return; an expansion of the Palestinian police force; granting 
the autonomy a consular status in Jerusalem; a festive ceremony 
by 'Arafat and his guards in Jerusalem; and a discussion of 
Jerusalem's final status. 
  [Peled] And Rabin never presented this to the public. 
Therefore, I believe this is a total fraud. 
  [Hecht] Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav demands that the 
government immediately present before the Knesset all the secret 
documents. Moledet Chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi demands that 
Yitzhaq Rabin immediately announce that all the agreements 
signed with 'Arafat are invalid. 
  The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza stated that 'Arafat's remarks prove that the Israeli 
Government has taken the path of selling out even Jerusalem. 
The council says it will do everything it can to stop the 
deterioration.

<F P=106> [News conference with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. </F>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, following their meeting 
at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem; broadcast in 
progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Rabin, in English] ...dialogue, even though 
indirectly, hopefully that in the future it will be directly. 
There are lots of problems. We had a beginning. Still a long 
way to go. We appreciate very much the efforts of Secretary 
Christopher by traveling between Damascus and Israel, and his 
efforts to find ways to bring the parties closer in their 
positions and by that to facilitate real breakthrough. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Qol Yisra'el's political correspondent Shlomo Raz] Today we 
heard of remarks by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat regarding jihad 
and a commitment he received from Israel regarding Jerusalem. 
Would you care to comment, sir? 
  [Rabin] If he speaks of a letter issued following the Cairo 
agreement, then I wrote this letter on 8 May. It was presented 
before the Knesset. It makes no mention of Jerusalem. There 
was no other letter which I or any other Israeli wrote following 
the Cairo agreement which relates to Jerusalem. At the same 
time, the Document of Principles, signed on 13 September 1993 in 
Washington, states that there are issues that pertain to the 
permanent solution. It lists several issues, as examples, 
including Jerusalem. There will be issues that can be raised 
during the negotiations on the permanent solution. 
  As for to his remarks regarding jihad, if indeed he called 
for jihad, it is a grave violation of his commitment, made in 
the letter he had signed, which resulted in the mutual 
recognition between the PLO and Israel. If indeed he made that 
call, it would cast doubt on the continuation of the process 
between the Palestinians and ourselves. We cannot accept a 
violation of a commitment regarding the PLO undertaking not to 
be involved in violence and terror. [passage omitted] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew, which joined the relay of the 
news conference at 1530 GMT, carries a reply by Rabin to a 
question on the answers Christopher brought from Damascus, in 
which he says: "It is not my duty to present the details. I 
believe that if the secretary decided to return to Damascus and 
to attempt to continue the dialogue in Syria, perhaps there is a 
glimpse of hope. I believe that exploiting every opportunity is 
the right thing to do. I believe the secretary is clear 
regarding our stands and the components required on our part in 
order to attain peace."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Lothar </F>
Ruehl; place and date not given: "`The EU Discriminates Against 
Israel, We Cannot Tolerate That'"] 
  [Text] [Ruehl] You concluded the Cairo interim agreement 
on partial Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and Gaza with PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat under difficult conditions. Indeed, the 
signing seemed to be in doubt for a moment. Does that mean that 
there are still differences? 
  [Rabin] When we signed the 1993 Washington declaration, we 
knew that we were taking on a great many difficulties. However, 
we realized that we had to take risks to achieve our goal: the 
end of 100 years of conflict between the Jewish and Arab 
populations of Palestine, between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Why? Because we are not concluding peace with another country, 
but with a population without a state. If we sign a peace 
treaty with an Arab neighbor, then we what we are concluding is 
a treaty based on a particular border, and we then go on to 
decide how that peace is to be implemented along the clear 
dividing line between us and our neighbors. That means: On our 
side of the peaceful border, we bear the responsibility, on the 
other side, the other country -- each side bears a 
responsibility toward the other. 
  [Ruehl] As in the case of Sinai and Egypt? 
  [Rabin] Yes, as in the case of Egypt. It was not possible 
to achieve a permanent solution with the Palestinians in one 
move. The reality of this was accepted at the Madrid 
international conference as the basis for Israel's participation 
in negotiations with the neighboring countries that are in a 
state of war with us: Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. This means 
that the process consists of two phases: The first phase 
centers on the interim agreement on an internal settlement for 
the Palestinian people to occur over a transitional period and 
only after that, once the reality on the ground has changed, 
will we enter phase two, in which we will negotiate a solution. 
There is a web of ties linking both populations to each other. 
The situation in Gaza is much simpler, but is still complicated 
enough. The Israeli settlements there will remain. 
  [Ruehl] How many settlers are involved? 
  [Rabin] About 5,000 people, but their settlements are in the 
middle of territory that will come under Palestinian 
administration. These settlements are extra-territorial with 
regard to the jurisdiction of Palestinian local autonomy. There 
are a certain number of roads linking these settlements to 
Israel, and we will also have to ensure the security of those 
routes. Under these circumstances, organizing a peaceful 
coexistence between two populations who live intermingled with 
each in a confined area is a difficult task. That is why the 
agreement must be detailed enough to allow the Palestinians to 
run their affairs on the one hand while, at the same time, 
Israel can remain responsible for the Jewish settlements and for 
the security, including external security, of all the Israelis. 
I was in favor of the interim agreement settling as much as 
possible. 
  [Ruehl] But did that involve risks? 
  [Rabin] It would have been riskier to leave certain points 
unclarified and then to argue about them. It will also be 
difficult enough to cooperate on changing reality in the spirit 
of peaceful coexistence, but we will try. That is the acid test 
for the value of the agreement with the PLO. However, one must 
also take account of the fact that it was possible to conclude 
the negotiations with an accord, that is, the interim agreement, 
only one month after the Hebron tragedy. There was only a short 
delay. Even if one compares the date with the one that was set 
by the Washington declaration for the implementation of 
Gaza-Jericho autonomy, 13 April 1994, I see no reason why the 
implementation cannot be accomplished by the end of May. 
  [Ruehl] However, has the delay not placed a burden on the 
psychological situation surrounding the implementation of the 
autonomy agreement? 
  [Rabin] All the opponents of the agreement and, in addition 
to that, of peace between Israel and the Arabs have sought to 
use the delays to torpedo the peace process. It can, however, 
be seen that the detailed result facilitated rapid 
implementation and that is why the actual implementation of the 
agreement could overlap with the last stage of the negotiations. 
I assume that we now need no more than three to four weeks, if 
the Palestinians are ready to exercise policing duties shortly. 
  [Ruehl] But that does not mean that all the dangers have 
been eliminated. 
  [Rabin] On the Palestinian side, the strongest opposition to 
the treaty and peaceful coexistence with Israel primarily comes 
from extremist Islamic fundamentalists. They represent a great 
risk. Islamic terrorist groups murder Israelis not just to fight 
Israel, but also to try to bring about the collapse of the peace 
process. I do not dispute the fact that terrorist attacks in 
Israel reduce the level of support for the treaty. People in 
Israel have been writing letters of this kind to me: "I was in 
favor of a political solution of the kind that you have been 
pursuing, but what purpose is served by a agreement with the PLO 
if it fails to provide us with more security than before?" Of 
course, the Palestinian extremists know that, and that is why I 
say that the fulfillment of these security hopes on the part of 
the Israelis combined with the fulfillment of the Palestinians 
hopes regarding the running of their own affairs will determine 
whether or not the Gaza-Jericho agreement will create prospects 
for a political solution to peaceful coexistence. We said to 
our people that terrorism will be reduced, and the PLO has told 
the Palestinians that autonomy will result in effective self- 
administration, which will bring social and economic 
development. If these two goals are not achieved, then we will 
have a problem. 
  [Ruehl] When you talk about security for Israel, what do 
you mean by that? 
  [Rabin] For Israel, it means the personal security of its 
citizens. That is because the Palestinians do not pose a threat 
to Israel's existence. 
  [Ruehl] It is being said in Israel that Rabin's government 
has neglected its national security, because it has said that it 
is prepared to negotiate the return of Arab refugees from the 
1967 war. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs would return and 
"flood" Israel. Is there not an indirect threat of this kind? 
  [Rabin] Of course not. If you read the Cairo agreement, you 
will see that it does not contain anything about refugees that 
was not already mentioned in the Camp David accord, which former 
Likud chairman Begin agreed with Egypt, namely, a discussion 
about the refugee problem, irrespective of what territories are 
the subject of an autonomy agreement. The bulk of the refugee 
problem concerns those people who fled from their homes in 
1948/49, from territories that have belonged to Israel since 
that time. We will then raise the issue of Jewish refugees from 
Arab states. The Washington declaration states that refugee 
issues will be raised in later negotiations on a definitive 
political solution. Another question is that of the 1967 
"displaced persons," that is, those Palestinians in what was 
formerly west Jordanian territory who fled during the Six Day 
War. A committee composed of the four parties concerned -- 
Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the PLO -- will start discussing 
these issues one month after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. We have not agreed on any figures or numbers in this 
respect. We have not assumed any obligations. 
  [Ruehl] Is this related to the presence of about 120,000 
Israeli settlers in territories that have been occupied since 
1967, to the question of land that belonged to Arabs until then? 
  [Rabin] The Washington declaration states that the settlers 
will remain during the interim period and that this issue will 
not be raised until negotiations take place on a permanent 
overall solution. That is in line with the 1978 Camp David 
accord. Nothing has changed in this respect. The refugee 
question, the question of the settlers, the border question, and 
the question of the status of Jerusalem are being kept for the 
last set of negotiations, which will also deal with the 
principles for respecting religious freedom and free access to 
all the holy sites for the various religions in Jerusalem. 
  [Ruehl] Since 1967, Israeli settlement policy has led to the 
appearance of large housing complexes where settlers are 
concentrated. Do these new settlements belong to the city of 
Jerusalem? 
  [Rabin] Until now, no Israeli Government has annexed 
territory under Israeli control and added it to the territory of 
the city of Jerusalem as set out in the 1967 law on the unity of 
the capital of Israel. The situation has not changed since the 
July 1967 law, which placed Jerusalem under the sovereignty of 
the Israeli state. Until the outcome of future negotiations on a 
permanent political solution, the remaining territory on the 
Jordanian West Bank, which was occupied during the 1967 war with 
Jordan will remain under Israeli military rule in accordance 
with international law. Until now, we have only concluded a 
treaty on internal Palestinian autonomy in the two areas of 
Jericho and Gaza. Jerusalem belongs to Israel, and it is and 
will remain the capital of Israel. 
  [Ruehl] Has the PLO the ability to effectively exercise 
political and administrative responsibility for the two areas 
and to make a success of autonomy? 
  [Rabin] The PLO must begin by gaining experience in 
administration. It will have an opportunity to do so in Gaza 
and Jericho, because all the wishes and demands of the 
Palestinian population in those areas will be directed to it. 
This involves political practice and the local administration, 
which has remained in Arab hands since 1967. In Gaza, we make a 
distinction between Israeli military rule, which will now come 
to an end, and civilian administration under military rule. The 
civilian administration is essentially Palestinian: Of the 
6,000 employees, only 160 are Israelis. All heads of 
administrative agencies are Palestinians. All together, Israel 
employs 24,000 in the public service, and 18,000 in 
transportation and public utilities, and other facilities. Each 
month, $10 million is paid out of the Israeli state budget for 
salaries and wages. I put the following question to 'Arafat in 
Cairo: "What is going to happen to this expenditure? Who is 
going to pay when we leave?" 
  [Ruehl] What was the PLO chairman's answer to that? 
  [Rabin] He is relying on international donors, who have 
promised support for the development of autonomy. The 
Washington conference of prospective donors has envisaged a sum 
of about $2.2 billion spread over five years. The PLO will now 
have to assume responsibility for the 750,000 Palestinians in 
Gaza and the 20,000 or so in Jericho, and it will have to prove 
to the population that it can discharge its responsibility. 
  That is the criterion for measuring the success of autonomy. 
This means preventing terrorist attacks above all. The PLO must 
see to it that these two regions do not serve as springboards 
for terrorist attacks against Israel or against Israelis living 
in these areas. 
  [Ruehl] That is the key issue in the debate in Israel on 
the autonomy agreement and the withdrawal of Israeli troops, as 
well as in discussion of the protection of settlements in Gaza 
and the security of Israel itself. 
  [Rabin] There are risks, and there is a risk for the PLO in 
this respect, too. In future, the PLO must see to security in 
its own areas. Without security, there will be no further 
positive developments, including economic ones. It is in the 
vital interest of the Palestinians to foster security, just as 
it lies in Israel's interests for the Palestinian population to 
make economic progress and see the light at the end of the 
tunnel. That is the only way in which a lasting solution can be 
achieved. That is why we are interested in a strong PLO police 
force, financial support for autonomy, as well as investment by 
the international community in those areas. 
  [Ruehl] Will you reopen the border crossing-points for 
Palestinian workers and businessmen? 
  [Rabin] Yes, as long as they are not used to bring in 
terrorists. During the negotiations on the border, the security 
question must be solved in a way that is in line with Israeli 
security interests. Between 25 and 33 percent of GDP in Gaza 
and the West Bank, which have been administered by Israel since 
1967, comes from Palestinians who work in Israel. This 
population has to cooperate with Israel when the borders are 
open in order to improve its standard of living. 
  [Ruehl] What kind of international cooperation can provide a 
framework for that? 
  [Rabin] We have to distinguish between several different 
aspects: financial support for the Palestinians, that is, aid 
totalling $2.2 billion; regional cooperation; and economic 
relations with Israel. Trade between the European Union [EU] 
and Israel was the main subject of the talks that I have held in 
five European countries, including Bonn. In 1993, the Israeli 
trade deficit with the former European Community amounted to 
$4.5 billion and to $7 billion if all of Western Europe and the 
EFTA countries are included. We are not asking for membership, 
but we cannoyt tolerate discrimination on the part of the EU. 
  [Ruehl] What do you mean by discrimination? 
  [Rabin] For example, Siemens can make a bid for Israeli 
power company investment projects, but Israeli firms cannot put 
in bids in Germany and the EU countries in the same way. 
Certain community rules prevent us from being given a chance to 
compete fairly. The value of our exports to the United States 
is almost the same as that of our exports to Europe. Trade with 
the United States is balanced, and in addition, we receive $3 
billion of U.S. foreign aid each year. We are not asking for 
special terms or European support, but we do insist on fair 
"terms of trade" with a European market open to us. We cannot 
demand that the Israeli people pay the price for peace if we 
cannot simultaneously offer prospects for positive economic 
development within the framework of regional cooperation with 
our Arab neighbors and internationally. 
  [Ruehl] What is your view of the EU's intention of offering 
more funds to provide economic support for Palestinian autonomy? 
  [Rabin] We support it. We do not want European 
contributions, but a significant adjustment to the foreign trade 
deficit with Europe through appropriate agreements with the EU. 
Every billion dollars that is earned in exports means between 
15,000 and 20,000 jobs in Israel. A peaceful settlement for the 
region must also bring economic advantages to Israel. 
  [Ruehl] What are the prospects like for extending peace to 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon? 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately, Lebanon is not prepared to take even 
one step unless it receives a green light from Damascus. Even 
Jordan is watching Damascus and waiting for a signal before it 
takes further steps, although we have already held negotiations. 
I cannot understand why the Jordanians see themselves as being 
dependent on the Syrians, but this is the case. As far as Syria 
is concerned, there is a great gulf between us. Syria has also 
condemned the agreement with the PLO and has not embarked on the 
path to peace with Israel, despite all the U.S. attempts at 
mediation. These U.S. efforts will continue, but I would not 
venture to make any predictions. However, we need a reliable 
peace, not just the consolidation of a truce. 
  [Ruehl] You have only had that kind of peace with Egypt. 
  [Rabin] President Sadat dispelled mistrust with his visit to 
Jerusalem. He went 90 percent of the way to convince the 
Israeli people that he was serious about peace. Begin only 
needed to go 10 percent of the way. Sadat was actively 
committed to peace. That is the difference between him and 
Al-Asad, and that is where the problems start. The questions 
that people in Israel ask are: We should believe him when he 
talks about peace, but can we believe him? 
  [Ruehl] Do you want Al-Asad to come to the Knesset in 
Jerusalem like Sadat? 
  [Rabin] I did not say that and I do not expect that. 
However, President Al-Asad does not have the right to demand 
the kind of conditions for peace of Israel that Sadat had claim 
to. 
  [Ruehl] You have indicated that your government would be 
prepared to discuss the return of the Golan Heights to Syria 
during negotiations on peace and if Syria were to respond 
appropriately. 
  [Rabin] I have actually said even more than that, namely, 
that I would be prepared to put the question of a significant 
withdrawal form the Golan Heights to the Israeli people in the 
form of a referendum, if we can draw up a sensible peace treaty 
with Syria. 
  [Ruehl] That is to say, mutual conditions for the 
demilitarization of the border and arms controls? 
  [Rabin] Yes, and in conjunction with normalization and a 
phased withdrawal over a given period of time. We must have a 
clear-cut border agreement and take account of the fact that in 
the north, vis-a-vis the Golan, Israel has no territory to 
withdraw into for defensive purposes and needs security.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher may 
return to the Middle East in a month. This remark was made by 
Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United 
States, to our political correspondent Shlomo Raz at the end of 
Christopher talks in Jerusalem. Ambassador Rabinovich noted 
that there is no breakthrough in the talks with the Syrians, and 
described them as a living process. 
  He further said that the clarifications received from the 
Syrians are not satisfactory, but they do contain some positive 
and real aspects. Rabinovich noted that Christopher will be 
leaving for Damascus tomorrow with additional Israeli questions 
regarding the Syrian replies and, according to him, we will know 
where the talks are headed in less than two days.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "A Mistaken Formula for </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Israel's formula for negotiations with Syria, as 
expounded by Rabin, "The depth of withdrawal will equal the 
depth of peace," is fundamentally and tactically flawed. It 
means that if al-Asad agrees to full peace, Israel will be 
committed to full withdrawal with all this entails. On the face 
of it this is fine, but in fact it poses obstacles on Israel's 
negotiating path. 
  Al-Asad claims he has already made his move when he publicly 
and privately declared in President Clinton's presence in Geneva 
that Syria has made a strategic decision to seek peace. Even 
though he did not enter the details, the Syrians claim he meant 
full peace. He is willing to discuss the stages leading to 
peace, but the basic decision has already been publicly stated. 
Al-Asad claims it is now Rabin's turn to reciprocate according 
to the stipulations of the Israeli formula. If full peace is 
intended, Rabin must complete the formula by stating: Full 
withdrawal. According to al-Asad it will be possible to discuss 
the security arrangements which the two sides require at a later 
stage. The Syrians claim, however, that Rabin has retracted and 
is unwilling to implement his formula. 
  I believe Israel's attitude should have been different. 
Israel should have presented a different formula: The depth of 
withdrawal will equal the depth of the security arrangements! 
According to this formula, for example, if al-Asad demands to 
limit the size of the demilitarized zone, then the depth of 
Israeli withdrawal will also be limited. If al-Asad is opposed, 
for example, to Israeli-manned warning stations on the Golan 
Heights, then the progress and stages of Israeli withdrawal will 
be prolonged by years. If al-Asad unequivocally rejects border 
modifications, Israel will demand to maintain the warning 
stations for a longer duration. The internal link between the 
depth of withdrawal and security arrangements will enable Israel 
to conduct the negotiations from a more convenient position. 
According to this formula peace is self-evident and above 
argument. The only argument will revolve around the security 
arrangements, a position which will be very easy to explain to 
the Israelis and the U.S. mediator. For many Israelis peace 
primarily means security for them and for Israel. 
  We are being informed by spokesmen and the media that Israel 
and Syria have already made significant progress during 
Christopher's recent visit. This progress in the negotiations 
with Syria should have been made during September, prior to the 
Oslo agreement. At that time it was concluded that the 
negotiations will be held at the highest level, between Rabin 
and al-Asad with Christopher as mediator. Now we have reached 
that stage again, and even though we are not talking here about 
direct negotiations between the two leaders, a higher level of 
contacts has been attained. However, this is not enough for 
completing the complicated negotiations on many sensitive issues 
between two countries which have been at war for dozens of years. 
  The gap between the sides is still profound and we must not 
harbor any illusions that the negotiations will be easy. It is 
more likely that we will witness serious crises before a 
breakthrough is made. Al-Asad and Rabin are known to be tough 
negotiators. Both of them want this reputation of toughness to 
be justified and vindicated. They have experience in 
negotiating with one another from 1974. During Christopher's 
last visit, the two sides entered the stage of preliminary 
clarifications, each seeking the other side's clarifications on 
the issues of normalization and the withdrawal stages. This 
stage was preceded by various declarations, with Rabin being the 
one who made the more significant move in his statement 
regarding Golan Heights settlements. 
  Al-Asad is still concentrating on the method of 
negotiations, 
namely on how to take the best advantage of the U.S. mediator. 
This is not a simple issue for al-Asad, and not only because 
Washington is suspicious of Syria (due to its support of 
terrorism and drug dealing) and is behaving unfairly toward it, 
as the Syrian president maintains. Al-Asad's associates say 
that the Syrian president believes that Washington is in 
Israel's pocket. Even if we are dealing here with an extremely 
supportive U.S. Administration, however, this does not mean that 
Israel is dictating things to Washington. Al-Asad, however, 
does not want to forfeit the possibility of a more intensive 
involvement of the U.S. mediator (he also has no choice). He 
correctly surmises that Washington is unlikely to exert heavy 
pressure on Israel to make more concessions and to disregard its 
vital interests. 
  Al-Asad will henceforth focus on demanding intensive 
negotiations in which Christopher will serve as a traveling 
mediator. Al-Asad has still not reached the stage in which he 
will ask the United States for any recompense. Even though he 
would have preferred mediators of the like of Kissinger and 
James Baker, he has to adjust to the present mediator, who 
strikes him as being too soft. Al-Asad expects to reach the 
stage in which President Clinton himself will intervene. His 
mere presence will exert pressure on Israel, which will not want 
to prevent the friendly President from scoring an achievement. 
As long as we have not reached this stage, al-Asad will not 
agree to hold a meeting with Rabin. Such a meeting will take 
place if Rabin suddenly decides to make a grand concession, or 
when the two meet with President Clinton at a very advanced 
stage of the negotiations.

  [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] completed its 
military redeployment in the Gaza Strip in the early hours of 
this morning. The head of Southern Command, Major General Matan 
Vilna'i, handed over control to the commander of Palestinian 
forces in the Strip. A formal hand-over ceremony will take 
place later today, although at the request of settlers, the 
ceremony will now take place in Gaza City, and not in Gush 
Qatif, as originally planned. [passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 18 May 
adds: 
"Maj. Gen. Vilna'i said it is difficult to be optimistic about 
the Gaza Strip's future, because the central problem is no 
longer security, but rather the socioeconomic issue -- the need 
to maintain an orderly life in the Gaza Strip." 
  [The report adds that "the IDF troops have completed their 
redeployment in the Qatif Bloc and around the Gaza Strip."] 
  The departing Israeli troops were forced to fire tear gas at 
Palestinian stone throwers, and Palestinian police also fired in 
the air to disperse thousands of residents who tried to break 
into the brigade headquarters as the Israeli troops departed. 
  About 2,000 Palestinian policemen have already been deployed 
in the Gaza Strip, from a total force of 7,000 which will 
eventually arrive. The outgoing commander of the IDF forces in 
the Gaza Strip, Brigadier General Doron Almog, said the transfer 
of bases and authority had gone smoothly and there is good 
coordination between the two sides. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>
  [Excerpts] As of 1400 yesterday, the Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip have been running their own lives. 
  Thirty-four civilian offices were handed over to the 
Palestinians in a lengthy ceremony held at the Civil 
Administration's new offices in the Erez industrial zone, and 
the Israeli Civil Administration in the Gaza Strip officially 
became the civilian liaison center between Israel and the 
Palestinians. 
  The civilian Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip is 
headed by Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, and 
Dr. Riyad al-Za'nun. The three will operate out of a new office 
set up near the Palestinian police building in Gaza. 
Forty-eight vehicles to be used by the Palestinian Authority 
arrived in the Gaza Strip yesterday from Egypt. 
  The first decisions passed by the Palestinian Authority were 
to declare Friday the official day of rest and the days of Id 
al-Adha a holiday. [passage omitted] 
  After an initial meeting between the sides, representatives 
of the Israeli offices and their Palestinian counterparts 
proceeded to sign the transfer of powers. Representatives of 34 
offices -- transportation, education, treasury, interior, 
health, and others -- spent four long hours signing the letters 
of empowerment written in English. 
  The civilian powers were officially handed over to the 
Palestinians after Brigadier General Dov Gazit, head of the 
Civil Administration, and Palestinian representative Frayj 
al-Khayri signed the letters. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The PLO leadership has ordered that guns held by 
Palestinians in Gaza be collected, but only few heeded this 
order. This was reported at the cabinet's weekly session today. 
Our correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the ministers were 
also told that Fatah activists in the Gaza Strip have been 
criticizing the PLO leadership, claiming that it disregards them. 
  The cabinet was further told that Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] has been questioning the legitimacy of the PLO 
leadership and opposing the agreement. There is a fear that the 
economic deterioration in Gaza might be followed by a security 
deterioration. 
  The ministers were also told that the Palestinian Authority 
will take part in issuing working permits in Israel for 
Palestinian laborers.

  [Text] Touring the site of this morning's terrorist attack 
near Bet Hagay, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq said he foresees a 
continuation of terror attacks in Judaea, Samaria, and the Qatif 
bloc. The chief of staff called on all people licensed to carry 
weapons to do so, and to help the security forces and 
intelligence personnel protect thousands of vehicles driving 
through Judaea and Samaria. He added that roadblocks can only 
prevent terror attacks in their immediate vicinity and that the 
task of providing additional protection for the population falls 
to the Israeli Army and the citizens themselves.

  [Text] There were demonstrations last night in the wake of 
the terrorist attack in Hebron and in protest against the 
government's peace policy. In Jerusalem's Paris Square opposite 
the prime minister's residence, five demonstrators were arrested 
by police when they tried to break through barricades. 
  On the Jerusalem-Jericho road, police dispersed 
demonstrators 
from the nearby settlement of Kfar Adumim, home of the Hebron 
attack victims. According to Qol Yisra'el's reporter on the 
scene, the demonstrators not only blocked the highway, but 
violently confronted Arab drivers.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to PLO chairman, 
today said Yasir 'Arafat and other PLO leaders will arrive in 
the self-rule area in the Gaza Strip during the first half of 
next month. 
  In a telephone interview from Cairo with our correspondent 
Sa'id Mu'addi, Dr. Sha'th said reports received from the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho show things are going very well. The same 
applies to the reports he received from Major General Amnon 
Shahaq, head of the Israeli negotiations team, he added. 
  Asked about 'Arafat's statements in Johannesburg, in which 
he 
called for jihad to liberate Jerusalem, Dr. Sha'th said there 
are things which are sometimes interpreted in an exaggerated 
manner. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the PLO decided to form the Palestinian 
authority at this stage from those who have already been chosen 
until the other members of this authority are named. He added 
that negotiations on the transfer of powers to the Palestinians 
in the rest of the West Bank will begin after the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F>
adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Sa'id Mu'addi in Cairo 
on 18 May from the "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mu'addi] One last question, 
Dr. Nabil. Yasir 'Arafat's statements in Johannesburg drew 
angry reactions from the political leadership in Jerusalem, 
particularly the prime minister. What is your comment? 
  [Sha'th] My comment is that there is sometimes exaggeration, 
even in interpreting what President 'Arafat meant. Jihad in 
Islam is dual -- minor and major jihad. When Prophet Muhammad, 
may God's peace and blessing be upon him, conquered Mecca, he 
said: Minor jihad is now over and major jihad begins. The 
major jihad is the jihad of soul, work, construction, and all 
forms of struggle, not only the military jihad as, I believe, 
was understood in various places. Jihad for Jerusalem means 
struggle for the sake of insistence on presenting what we 
demand, that is, to have East Jerusalem as the capital of the 
Palestinian state. However, this will take place through 
various forms of peaceful struggle that will end with 
negotiations on the final status, an important part of which 
should be on Jerusalem. Our position on these negotiations is 
clear right now. This, I think, is what President 'Arafat meant. 
  [Mu'addi] One question, after the last, doctor. Was there a 
letter from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to Yasir 'Arafat on the 
status of Jerusalem? 
  [Sha'th] The letter Prime Minister Rabin exchanged with 
President 'Arafat, which was signed with the agreement as you 
may recall, stated that negotiations on the final status can 
begin as soon as possible but not after the beginning of the 
third year or the end of the second year after the start of the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles. This means not 
later than 13 October 1995, namely, after one year and four or 
five months. These negotiations on the final status, as is 
clear in the Declaration of Principles, emphasize that Jerusalem 
is one of the five most important topics that will be discussed 
at these final negotiations. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian 
National Authority, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikha'el Tuchfeld] </F>
  [Text] PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat delivered an address at a 
Johannesburg mosque after the Mandela inauguration on 10 May. 
The occasion was closed to the media, but a tape of the speech 
reached the local Jewish community, which sent it on to Israel. 
  'Arafat's speech revolved primarily around the issue of 
Jerusalem. He said that the Cairo agreement was merely the 
first step and that the liberation of Jerusalem is the Muslims' 
main objective. He called on the Palestinian people to launch a 
jihad in a bid to liberate Jerusalem. 'Arafat's bombshell, with 
or without quotation marks, was his revelation that when the 
Cairo agreement was signed, he received an Israeli letter 
confirming that Jerusalem is one of the issues on the 
negotiations agenda and that the discussion on Jerusalem will 
begin within three years. Let us hear him: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English] The jihad will 
continue. And Jerusalem is not for the Palestinian people; it is 
for all the Muslim ummah [nation]. You are responsible for 
Palestine and for Jerusalem before me. You have to understand 
our meaning: Battle is not to get how much we can achieve from 
them here or there. Our main battle is Jerusalem: Jerusalem, 
the first shrine of the Muslims. This has to be understood for 
everybody. And for this I was insisting, before signing, to 
have a letter from them, from the Israelis, that Jerusalem is 
one of the items which has to be under discussion. And not this 
state, the permanent state of Israel. No! It's the permanent 
state of Palestine! Yes, it is a permanent state of Palestine. 
  And in this letter -- it is very important for everybody to 
know -- I insist to mention, and they had written it, and I have 
this letter. I didn't declare, I didn't publish it till now. 
In this letter, we are responsible for all the Christian and 
the Muslim and the Islamic holy sacred places. 
  You have to come and to fight and to start the jihad to 
liberate Jerusalem, your first shrine. And this is very 
important, and for this in the agreement, I insist -- with my 
colleagues, with my brothers -- to mention that not exceeding 
the beginning of the third year and directly after the signing 
of the Cairo agreement, to start discussing the future of 
Jerusalem; the future of Jerusalem. 
  And, you saw me in the TV while I was hesitating. You 
remember this thing? You remember the picture? Because I was 
insisting to mention Jerusalem. And I said: Okay, I don't want 
only from Rabin this promise. No, I want this promise from the 
cosponsors Christopher and Kozyrev and the witness, President 
Mubarak. And this had been done, which is very important for 
you. 
  The Samarians in Nabulus and the Neturey Karta 
[ultra-Orthodox community] in Jerusalem, they are refusing to 
recognize the State of Israel, and they are considering 
themselves as Palestinians. I am saying this to give the proof 
that what they are saying that it is their capital -- no, it is 
not their capital! It is our capital; it is your capital! It 
is the first shrine of the Islam and of the Muslims. [end 
recording]

  [Text] President Husni Mubarak renewed his calls to Yemeni 
leaders to stop fighting and to allow dialogue to triumph. He 
affirmed that war never resolves any issue in the world. In 
exclusive statements to Samir Rajab, chief editor of MAYU 
newspaper, the president said war ends unity and does not 
protect it. The Yemeni people are the ones paying the price 
with their own blood and their vital institutions that are being 
destroyed by the battles and wars. War has never resolved any 
issue in the world, even when one party triumphs over another. 
  The president added that he has repeatedly advised Yemeni 
leaders not to resort to military force. The basis for 
resolving any problem should always be dialogue.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- Ministry of Defence and 
Armed Forces Logistics here Monday rejected a claim printed in 
U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST on sending explosives to Zagreb 
and described it as a new plot of U.S. media against the world 
Muslims. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST in its Friday issue quoted an unknown 
source, saying that using a jumbo jet to fly between Iran and 
Zagreb, Iran has transfered to Zagreb 60 tons of explosives and 
raw materials used in manufacturing arms. 
  Issuing a statement, the ministry said that the plots of the 
arrogant world media are merely aimed at tarnishing the humane 
image of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Iran's Red Crescent Society (IRCS) has extended a large 
amount of relief aid to Bosnian Muslims since the start of the 
war between the Muslims and the Serbs. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran recently opened its embassy in 
Sarajevo, the city which was under Serbian siege for a long 
time. Opening of Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo created a condition 
in which the Muslims and Croats reached understanding and 
created co-existence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces Logistics said 
that raising such baseless claims especially at the time of 
opening of Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo and the announcement of 
Iran's repeated declaration of readiness to send 10,000 troops 
under the United Nations peace keeping force (UNPROFOR) to 
Bosnia are attempts to prevent Iran's diplomatic moves to end 
the massacre of the oppressed Muslims in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah after the </F>
extraordinary cabinet session at Government House in Beirut on 
16 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] By request of the prime minister, the Council of 
Ministers held an extraordinary session this evening during 
which it discussed the political situation in the country in 
light of the proposal presented by the prime minister and last 
week's events. The prime minister affirmed that his refusal to 
perform his duties was merely an introduction and a call for 
serious dialogue. After frank and open discussions among the 
ministers during the session, the Council affirmed the 
Government's adherence to the political, security, financial, 
economic, and social goals which it came to accomplish in the 
first place. The Government will do this as a united team that 
believes in the wisdom of the institution -- an institution that 
has been entrusted with executive authority within the framework 
of the constitutional principles of separation of duties and 
cooperation among the various authorities. 
  The Council -- both prime minister and members -- affirmed 
their unanimous adherence to solidarity and to shouldering the 
crucial national responsibilities such as completing liberation, 
entrenching accord, reconstructing the country, and 
strengthening national peace by fortifying it economically and 
socially. 
  The Council also believes the session was an occasion for 
profound self-examination regarding the required action to 
confront the challenges through the cohesion and commitment of 
all Government members without exception.

  [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- A weekly specialising in 
Middle East affairs has blamed Saudi Arabia for the ongoing 
bloodbath in Yemen which has claimed thousands of lives. 
  "But in the way of neutrality, stands Saudi Arabia who still 
is out to get even with Sanaa for backing Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait. At that time Saudi Arabia retaliated with the expulsion 
of hundreds of thousands Yemeni workers, crippling the poorest 
Arab state's economy," said the MIDDLE EAST TIMES in its Monday 
[16 May] issue in Cairo. 
  "But now Egyptian observers say that Saudi Arabia seeks to 
partition Yemen as compensation for Yemen's attempts to severe 
Saudi-led Arab unity. 
  North Yemen sources also speculate that "Saudi Arabia's 
defense minister dashed back home to save the south from Sanaa's 
jaws and prolong the prospects of war," said the 
English-language weekly in its cover story. 
  "Both Saudi Arabia and Western powers have backed the south 
enclave's call for outside intervention which they deem a 
lifeline able to halt the north's march on Aden dead in its 
tracks," it noted. 
  The weekly said that since Saudi Arabia's rapprochement with 
the regime of Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian Islamists view the Saudi 
Kingdom as a "traitor to their Koranic cause." 
  "Nor are they surprised that Saudi Arabia has thrown in its 
lot with the former socialists of the south, now that Egypt's 
Marxists such as Albert Farag and Lutfi Kholi have been reported 
hob-nobbing with Saudi princes," said the weekly.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus: "Syria Strongly </F>
Criticizes Inclusion of Its Name in the Terrorism List"] 
  [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is 
due in Damascus this evening and will go from there to Jerusalem 
in an attempt to bridge the Syrian and Israeli views on the 
question of a peace agreement. 
  On the eve of Christopher's arrival, Syria yesterday 
vehemently criticized the U.S. State Department's statement on 
terrorism and the inclusion of Syria's name in that statement. 
It saw it as incomprehensible and unjustified conduct on the 
eve of the U.S. official's visit to the region and the start of 
a new round of talks on peace. [passage omitted] 
  Referring to the U.S. statement on terrorism, responsible 
Syrian sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it was a violation of 
diplomatic and political tradition, unless Washington was no 
longer in control of its own decisions regarding its own purely 
national interests. 
  They added that that statement defied logic and was 
arbitrary 
in its classification, based on a warped and fanatical political 
premise which could only be Israeli. The sources added that 
anyone who examined the timing of the statement would feel that 
Israel was not uninvolved in it, or rather that it co-wrote or 
was even its sole author because it wanted to create a political 
problem for the U.S. Administration -- which is what it achieved. 
  The sources said that the seriousness of the statement lay 
in 
the fact that it was issued on the eve of Christopher's visit to 
the region to resume his tour and dialogues on peace, with 
Damascus as a main or rather the main party in any dialogue or 
breakthrough in the peace process. The sources wondered how the 
United States could hold a dialogue with "terrorist" Syria, the 
pivot and the main party in the process. Was it generally 
logical to talk to a terrorist about peace? Did that not 
represent a dilemma for the United States, and was the U.S. 
Administration not being openly blackmailed into itself openly 
blackmailing Syria for concessions in the peace process in 
Israel's favor? 
  The Syrian press also strongly attacked the U.S. State 
Department's statement on terrorism. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In the framework of the visits that yesterday led 
him to a number of health-related, tourist, and industrial 
installations and facilities in Algiers, Prime Minister Mokdad 
Sifi stopped at the premises of the paper L'OPINION where he had 
a chat with journalists on some important issues such as the 
security situation in the country. Rachid reports: 
  [Rachid] Dealing with the security issue, Sifi stressed to 
journalists of the paper L'OPINION the determination of the 
state to fight terrorism, and he affirmed that the role of the 
government lay in providing security and protection to citizens 
and property. In this respect, the prime minister reiterated 
his solidarity with the families of the victims of terrorism all 
the more because we are on the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha. 
  The prime minister also underlined that the state will 
endeavor to provide all means to increase and strengthen the 
capabilities of the security forces in their confrontation with 
terrorism. He stressed that the state will never make peace 
with terrorism and never stop fighting it until security and 
stability return and the people are able, in the future, to 
choose their leaders and representatives without pressure or 
coercion. Concerning negotiations with trade unions on wages, 
jobs, and unemployment benefits, the prime minister said that 
the government remains prepared to listen to all suggestions, 
and he affirmed that wage increases will not be ruled out when 
accompanied by increase in production. 
  Speaking on the information sector, Sifi stressed his desire 
to break the wall between the public-owned and private press. 
The prime minister also insisted on defending the right to life 
before any other consideration, and he reminded that practicing 
the trade of journalism at this time in the country calls for 
caution in accepting news from unreliable sources. Concerning 
access to information, about which journalists have long 
complained, the prime minister said that there are arrangements 
that should be made at the level of the premiership to resolve 
this problem and create direct links between the sources of 
information and the press.

defending it confidently. Quoting a responsible security 
source, a BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY correspondent reports: 
After their consecutive defeats in the northern provinces of the 
country, the militia recently mounted a failed assault on the 
Yerganik Pass. As a result of the bravery of the Islamic Army 
units and the mojahedin, the attack was repelled and heavy loss 
of life and damage was inflicted on the aggressors. The report 
adds: The militia began their attack at a time when Islamic Army 
units had confronted the enemy with humiliating defeats in 
various parts of Baghlan Province and conquered their positions 
one after another.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i to the Hajj </F>
congregation; date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] The sacred time for hajj is upon us 
with its eternal resources for the Islamic ummah. Thanks be to 
God for this unending gift and this ever-vital spring, by the 
grace of which Muslims of the world can benefit and reap rewards 
according to their own efforts and wisdom. 
  The extent and variety of the interests and issues which the 
divine hand, with its knowledge and wisdom, has fitted into the 
duty of hajj is of a magnitude which cannot be found in any 
other Islamic precept, ranging from spiritual presence and 
thought and the self- discovery of the Islamic individual in 
finding himself alone with God, and the cleansing of the heart 
from the dirt of sin and negligence, to the sense felt by the 
individual who finds himself among a crowd and the sense of 
unity felt by each Muslim with the entire Islamic ummah, and the 
sense of strength arising from the greatness of the gathering 
together of Muslims and to the effort made by every individual 
to attain a cure from spiritual wounds and diseases, that is, 
from sins, to curiosity and the will to understand and heal the 
profound scars and pains affecting the body of the ummah, to 
fellow-feelings with all Muslim nations, that is, the members of 
that body, are all contained in the hajj and its various rites 
and rituals. 
  The Koran describes the actions carried out during the hajj 
as rituals. This means that they are not merely individual 
actions aimed at fulfilling an individual duty; they are, 
rather, gestures intended to raise the level of insight and 
wisdom of the human beings who perform them. Underlying all 
these gestures is monotheism, that is, the rejection of all 
powers that, in some way, take possession of the bodies and 
souls of human beings and the establishment of the absolute rule 
of God over one's entire existence. In other words, the rule of 
an Islamic system and Islamic regulations over the individual 
and social lives of Muslims. 
  Included in the Koranic verses referring to the hajj, the 
Koran calls on everyone to disavow the idols worshipped by the 
infidels: But shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word 
that is false. [preceding Koranic verse read in Arabic] These 
idols may in some instances refer to the idols which were placed 
around the Ka'ba; but, undoubtedly, today and at all times, they 
also refer to those powers that have unjustly taken charge of 
the lives of humanity and, today, refer clearest of all to the 
power of arrogance and the satanic power of the United States 
and the power of Western culture and the corruption and 
decadance which are inflicted on Islamic countries and nations. 
  Of course, the pseudo-theologians affiliated to and in the 
pay of the governments-made-of-straw will insist that, no, those 
idols refer merely to Manat, Ellat, and Hubal, those very same 
idols that were crushed and annihilated under the foot of the 
victorious soldiers of the Great Prophet, peace be upon him and 
his scion, on the day when Mecca was captured. The intention of 
these monarchical-clergy is to empty the hajj of all political 
content to suit their own taste, ignorant of the fact that this 
very millions- strong gathering of Muslims that has come 
together from every corner of the world in one place at one time 
itself contains the richest political content. 
  This is a display put on by the Islamic ummah in which all 
differences of race, language, geography, and history are set 
aside and in which everyone joins together to form a whole. In 
order to prevent Muslims from understanding the significance of 
this great unity and in order to prevent individuals from 
gaining a sense of collectivity, these pseudo-clergymen and 
their masters have used every kind of lie, deceit, and falsehood 
and will continue to do so in order to make life as difficult as 
possible for the people who call for unity and invite the 
pilgrims to disavow the ring leaders of infidelity. 
  Islamic Iran wished to do nothing more than the minimum 
required by the hajj and that was to issue a call to unity to 
all Muslims, to invite all nations to learn the truth about one 
another and to ask people to express their hatred and revulsion 
of the ring leaders of infidelity and corruption. Anyone who 
stands against these valuable and lofty aims is speaking 
unjustly, regardless of what he says. As the Koran says: Shun 
the word that is false. 
  The word that is false is the unjust statements made by 
those 
who speak ill of the Islamic Republic, because the Islamic 
Republic rejects the rule of the Zionist government over 
occupied Palestine and considers as valueless the compromises 
made with the usurpers by a few corrupt and isolated 
individuals. It condemns the master-like interventions of the 
United States in Arabic countries. It exposes the ugliness of 
the treachery of some Islamic leaders against their own Muslim 
nations for the pleasure of the United States and the Zionists. 
It calls on Muslims to recognize their own tremendous strength 
which no superpower can withstand today. It deems Islamic 
insight and the rules of Shari'ah as capable of ruling Islamic 
countries. It considers the imposed culture of the West, the 
manifestation of which lies in nakedness, drunkeness, and 
faithlessness, to be harmful for Islamic countries, and, in a 
word, insists on obedience to the Koran and Islam. 
  Today, any Islamic country that states these things openly 
and adopts these same positions, that is, rejects usurper 
Israel, rejects the bullying interventions of the United States, 
rejects drunkeness, decadence, sexual corruption, and the 
mingling together of men and women, rejects the treachery of 
those who compromise with Israel, calls on Muslims to unite 
against and resist the superpowers, implements the rulings of 
Islam in government, the economy, politics, and so on, will be 
on the receiving end of exactly the same kind of propaganda 
which is spread throughout the world against Islamic Iran and 
exactly the kind of insults and falsehoods which are directed 
against the leaders of this country. 
  And the news agencies of the arrogant powers and Zionism and 
the radios of the United States and Britain and their allies 
will speak in exactly the same insulting way, with exactly the 
same kind of nonsense, about them. This is what was meant by: 
the word that is false, which was put alongside and on the same 
level as infidelity by God. How amazing that preachers and 
rulers in some corners of the world imitate these anti-Islamic 
and religiously forbidden actions of the propagandists of the 
United States and the Zionists. 
  Of course, the total submission to tyrannical rulers that, 
unfortunately, is the destiny of clergymen in some Islamic 
countries should not really be a source of amazement. 
  Today, the hajj, God's great blessing, is before you. Every 
single Muslim and every member of the Islamic ummah must benefit 
from it and as has been commanded [passage omitted], benefit 
from it to the advantage of their world and their religion. 
Today, the religion of Muslims is threatened by the enemy's 
cultural onslaught and the spread of corruption, injustice, 
faithlessness, and decadance among Islamic societies; something 
that is happening on the initiative of anti-Islamic powers and 
with the help of their propaganda and media, and the world of 
Muslims is threatened by the ever-increasing hegemony of 
arrogance over the affairs of Islamic countries and by the 
ever-increasing pressure on and hostility against any government 
or group that wishes to direct the minds of people toward the 
true rule of Islam and toward the independence and strength of 
Muslim nations. 
  And, of course, at the head of this all-embracing attack 
against Islam is the Great Satan, that is, the Government of the 
United States. Any clear-sighted eye can see the hand and will 
of that anti-Islamic government behind all the misfortunes which 
are inflicted on Islam and Muslims. 
  In occupied Palestine, the main reason behind the strong- 
headedness and the boldness of the Zionists and the most 
important factor behind the compromise made by most Arab 
governments before the endless demands of Israel is the United 
States. Without the backing of the United States, the 
reactionary governments of the region, which are well known for 
their submissiveness to the United States, would not have turned 
into the defenders of the usurping government and into the 
supposed defenders of those Palestinians who are against 
compromise. 
  And those who, according to their Islamic duties, must stand 
against Israel would not don the clothes of those who stand 
against the opponents of Israel. And, without the unconditional 
support of the United States, the usurping government would not 
have been able to bring about a great tragedy such as the 
massacre [in Hebron] at the noble shrine of Abraham, peace be 
upon him, and to avoid suffering all the consequences of such an 
action. 
  A similar situation applies to the Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The historical massacre of the people of 
Gorazde and Sarajevo by the Serbs, which can truly be seen as 
ranking among the most shameful deeds committed by humanity in 
our times, is a huge crime, the responsibility for which must be 
borne by the powers who dominate the world and, more than any 
other power, by the United States. 
  If it were not for their interference and their policies, 
the 
Muslims of Bosnia would not have been deprived of receiving 
assistance in the form of weapons in the face of well-equipped 
and well-armed Serbs, and a defenceless and besieged nation 
would not have been sacrificed to blood thirsty, shameless and 
encouraged aggressors. 
  What is painful is that the United States and NATO, after 
laying the groundwork in this heartless way for the massacre of 
Bosnian Muslims, after using the United Nations and its 
secretary general totally for their own ends, after displaying 
signs of their own pleasure at the killing of Muslims at the 
hands of the Serbs, and after several weeks passed since the 
savage attack of the aggressors against Muslim women, children, 
the old, and the young and the death of thousands of innocent 
people and the inflicting of suffering on such a scale on the 
people of the city of Gorazde, after all that to call a halt to 
the torture and describe that as humanitarianism, love of peace 
and neutrality. 
  Is it the case that, when an executioner stops torturing a 
person after hours and days, he can claim to be humane and use 
as evidence of his humanity the fact that he has stopped 
torturing his victim? 
  This apparently neutral, but in practice aggressive, stand 
against Muslims, is seen in the United states and its European 
collaborators, such as Britain, in every incident in which 
innocent Muslims constitute one side, and are subjected to their 
enemies' oppressive behavior and pressure. Among the examples 
are the sorrowful events of Kashmir and the intense suffering of 
the Muslims in Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan. 
  Wherever a government or a gathering chant slogans of 
Islam, and strive for the establishment of the rule of Islam, 
they become the inevitable targets of America's abuse, slander, 
ruthlessness, and malicious hostility. Clear examples have been 
shown toward the Sudanese Government, Algeria's Islamic 
movement, Lebanon's Hizballah, Hamas, Palestine's Islamic Jihad, 
Muslims of Egypt, and so on. In all these cases, the agents of 
global arrogance and above all the United States have been 
displaying fanatical behavior similar to that of tribal 
communities. The case of the United States' malicious 
hostilities, accompanied by wrath and injustice against Islamic 
Iran -- although in most cases ineffective thanks to the divine 
will and blessing -- is in itself a separate issue, of which 
many in the world are aware. 
  Now, do the great Islamic ummah, its leaders and 
politicians, 
intellectuals and religious authorities have no responsibilities 
with regard to this tragic plight of Muslims throughout the 
world? Do these people, who on the basis of the words spoken by 
the great prophet of Islam, may God's blessing be upon him and 
his scion, who said: He who shows no interest in the affairs of 
Muslims is no Muslim [preceding Koranic verse in Arabic] -- know 
of an occasion more suitable than the hajj to the House of God 
and of a time more suitable than the days of the revelations for 
displaying this important obligation. It was indeed not without 
reason that the exalted prophet, may God's blessing be upon him 
and his scion, chose the hajj period for promulgating the 
disavowal of infidels, which is a totally political activity 
within the framework of the very first Islamic government's 
general policy. He proclaimed a divine and Koranic command: And 
an announcement from God and His apostle, to the people 
assembled on the day of that great pilgrimage. That God and His 
apostle, dissolve treaty obligations with the pagans. If then, 
you repent, it would be best for you, but if you turn away, know 
you that you cannot frustrate god. And proclaim a grievous 
penalty to those who reject faith. [preceding Koranic verse in 
Arabic] 
  Indeed, the hajj is a religious duty during which and by way 
of which the most important political difficulties of the 
Islamic ummah can be resolved. For that reason, the hajj is a 
political-religious duty, the peculiarities of which have made 
this very apparent. Those who deny this and propagandize against 
it are in effect against the resolution of those difficulties. 
In brief, the hajj is a religious duty which concerns the 
ummah, the unity, the rule of Muslims, the improvement of the 
individual and the community, and in a nutshell, this world and 
the hereafter. 
  Those who do not want to accept the political connotations 
of 
hajj, in effect want to keep Islam away from politics and 
separate religion from politics. The issue of separating 
religion from politics is that very point which the enemies of 
Islam have been raising for decades. 
  Today, because a government based on the sacred religion of 
Islam has been set up in Iran, and the ever-increasing 
enthusiasm for the formation of Islamic governments has engulfed 
the entire Islamic world, the arrogants are raising that issue 
of separating religion from politics with more vigor and haste. 
Wherever they see the preparations for the realization of this 
aim of forming Islamic governments, they enter the scene with 
force and aggression to fight against it. 
  The rule of Islam requires resistance to the intervention of 
the arrogants in Islamic countries. It also warrants the need 
to keep away those who are dependent on these powers, and the 
slaves of the satan of selfish desires and arrogance, from 
ruling these countries. It is therefore natural that arrogance 
and those who depend on it, and the satans and their followers 
should be angry about the rule of Islam. By the same token, 
those who believe in God and the Day of Judgement should welcome 
it and strive toward it. 
  Now that a number of people from all over the world have had 
the fortune of perceiving [as heard] the period of revelations 
and the hajj to the House of God, I in all sincerity and modesty 
beseech the almighty to accept their pilgrimage and to endow 
them and the entire Muslim ummah with pilgrimage benefits. 
  I make the following recommendations to the brothers and 
sisters: 
  One: Seize this opportunity for self-making, repentance, and 
pleading to God and store spiritual assets to last you for the 
rest of your life. 
  Two: Ask Almighty God to eliminate great obstacles along the 
path of the Muslims; and keep repeating this request again and 
again in every prayer and hymns. 
  Three: Seize every opportunity to become acquainted with 
Muslims from other countries. Learn a lesson from the positive 
and negative points of their daily life. Non-Iranian Muslims 
should particularly hear the truth and circumstances of Islamic 
Iran from the mouths of their Iranian brothers, so that they 
discover for themselves whether the global propaganda against 
Iran is right or wrong. Today and always, they should strive to 
learn the instructions of the late imam, His Eminence Imam 
Khomeyni, may God bless his soul, on Muslim issues. They should 
become better and more closely familiar with that illustrious 
and pious personality of Islam's history. 
  Four: All the accurate information and knowledge you have 
acquired on the situation of the Islamic ummah or about your own 
country, pass it on to the Muslims from other countries. 
  Five: During conversations with your Muslim brothers, from 
every corner of the Islamic world, bear in mind the plight of 
the Islamic ummah and view the solidarity of the Islamic world. 
Take your thoughts and others' thoughts beyond the confinement 
of geographical borders, racial, ideological, factional, and 
other such divides. Think only of Islam and Muslims. 
  Six: Keep reminding your conversation partners to think of 
the God-given might of more than one billion Muslims and dozens 
of Islamic countries with so much material and spiritual wealth 
and with a huge heritage of culture, civilization, faith, and 
ethics. 
  Seven: Break the myth of the West's invincible might and 
particularly that of the United States, which global arrogance 
has always tried to magnify several times above reality and has 
tried to instill into the Muslims' minds. Remind yourselves and 
others that the Communist might, which on the surface seemed 
insurmountable, collapsed in our region and in front of this 
same generation's eyes. Nothing is left of that might now. The 
existing over-inflated powers, including the might of the United 
States, may be destroyed and annihilated just as easily. 
  Eight: Keep reminding the religious ulema and intellectuals 
of the Muslim countries of their immense burden of 
responsibility. 
  Nine: Remind the heads of Islamic states of their obligation 
to the Islamic ummah, which is to create unity among Muslims, to 
keep away from global powers, to incline and rely on their own 
nations, and to create healthy relations between the people and 
the rulers. Such a reminder by you is a duty in accordance with 
the Koranic verse which says: The imams of the Muslims need 
advising. [preceding verse in Arabic] Afterwards ask Almighty 
God to rectify this matter. 
  Ten: Remember always that when we say the heads of state are 
responsible, it does not mean the individual members of a nation 
have no responsibility. Rather, they can play a decisive role 
in the realization of all these great goals. It is hoped that 
with divine help and kind considerations of the Imam of the Era, 
may our souls be sacrificed for him and may God hasten his lofty 
advent, the esteemed pilgrims' hajj rituals will be accepted by 
God. 
  I beseech God to bestow his blessings and vast mercy on the 
entire Islamic ummah and every individual among the Muslims. 
May God's peace be on all pious slaves.

  [Text] Tehran, May 18 (AFP)--More than 50 armed riot police 
were deployed around the Saudi embassy in Tehran on Wednesday 
[18 May] amid a row between the two countries over a ban on an 
anti-US rally in Mecca, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  A police officer at the scene told AFP that the move was 
taken at the request of Saudi authorities to protect the embassy 
amid mounting tension between the two countries. 
  The police took up positions around the embassy and set up 
road blocks on streets leading to the building. 
  Iran called off an anti-US and anti-Israel demonstration, 
planned to be held by Iranian pilgrims in Mecca on Tuesday, 
under the threat of force from the Saudis.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa returned to Cairo from

Egyptian-European Cooperation Council. 
  In his arrival statement, he said the council meeting 
discussed means to enhance cooperation between the two sides and 
that an agreement was reached to start a new phase of 
Egyptian-European (?partnership) in a new framework by taking 
the new situation into consideration. 
  Concerning the situation in Yemen, he said the military 
conflict was a tragic action that would achieve no good and that 
it would not resolve the dispute. He added that efforts to 
handle this situation must continue, and there must be an 
immediate cease-fire, disengagement of forces, and a dialogue to 
deal with this situation in accordance to the Yemeni leaders' 
views. He noted that Egypt is monitoring the situation 
carefully.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-THAWRAH writes about the visit to Syria by the 
chief of U.S. diplomacy, noting the U.S. secretary's impressions 
of the visit, particularly Syria's commitment to the peace 
process and its honest concern to give it the required momentum 
to reach the desired and definite objective. 
  AL-THAWRAH says the Syrian trend and endeavor toward 
reaching 
a solution and settlement have always been governed by firm 
principles. The paper adds: The red lines, which nobody can 
bypass, remained the essence over which there is no bargaining. 
These red lines -- which are based on the resolutions of the 
United Nations and the Security Council and which underscore the 
full implementation of these resolutions on all fronts to 
guarantee the restoration of all Arab rights -- have always been 
the point of reference and the basis for a just and honorable 
solution and have always been appreciated by the world. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes a matter realized by everybody, namely, 
following the signing of the Oslo and Cairo self-rule agreements 
with the PLO, Israel has escalated its aggressiveness and 
terrorism inside and outside the occupied territory. 
Furthermore, Israel did not hesitate to bring into its military 
arsenals sophisticated and internationally banned offensive 
weapons. This has exposed Israel's intentions toward peace and 
revealed the intentions of its rulers toward making gains at the 
expense of Arab rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Syria, which accepted peace as a strategic 
option, cannot accept any Israeli presence on any inch of the 
Golan. Syria also adheres to a comprehensive solution on all 
tracks, insists on the principle of a comprehensive withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territory in exchange for a complete 
peace, and categorically rejects partial solutions. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH stresses the need for undoing the 
difficult Israeli knot, straightening and rectifying the course 
of the Tel Aviv rulers, and binding them to the Madrid point of 
reference and to implementing international legitimacy's 
resolutions. This is the task of the international community 
inasmuch as it is the task and responsibility of the U.S. 
sponsor for the sake of peace in the Middle East. 
  TISHRIN says the sought peace should be based on 
international legitimacy's resolutions, adding that since the 
beginning of the peace process Syria has reiterated its 
commitment to a just and comprehensive peace. TISHRIN notes 
that Syria is very much concerned about peace and that it will 
spare no efforts to activate the peace process and to help it 
achieve its objectives. 
  TISHRIN adds that the whole world is a witness to Syria's 
credibility, its sound course toward the peace process, and its 
full commitment to the requirements of this process. The paper 
adds that since the beginning Syria has been aware of the fact 
the path of peace does not pass at all through partial 
solutions, phased settlements, or individual deals. Syria 
believes that peace can only be achieved through ending the 
entire occupation and ushering the region into an age of 
stability and security. 
  TISHRIN stresses that the occupation, over all the years of 
Arab-Israeli conflict, has been the source of chaos and tension 
and the cause of wars, tragedies, and cycles of violence. 
Syria, which supports a just and comprehensive peace and 
adheres to ending the occupation, bases its stand on the 
resolutions of international legitimacy which provide for 
Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories and the 
inadmissibility of Israeli forces' occupation of these 
territories. Syria's objective is to reach the peace that 
guarantees restoration of Arab lands and full rights. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: For this, Syria responded to all 
international political efforts, particularly the American 
efforts. It always welcomed the role of the U.S. sponsor as a 
full partner and fair broker in the peace process who works to 
implement the U.S. initiative based on the return of land in 
exchange for peace. Through this agreement, Syria opened the 
road of peace, worked to achieve it on just bases, and 
reiterated its continuous readiness to give a momentum to the 
peace process. Syria hopes U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's tour will produce positive results to salvage the 
peace process.

<F P=106> [Article by Masud Nizami] </F>
  [Text] Despite the liberal and flexible stand which the 
Bangladesh Government has taken to bring about a solution to the 
Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHTs] problem, the leaders of the CHTs 
and the bloodthirsty Shanti Bahini [tribal insurgents] are 
treating this government policy as weakness and have intensified 
their violent and brutal activities. On April 10, a half-day 
strike was observed in the three districts of CHTs under the 
auspices of the Parbattya Gano Parishad [organization of Bengali 
settlers in CHTs] in protest against the kidnapping of several 
Bengali-speaking people from Naniarchar by the Shanti Bahini. 
The Shanti Bahini also kidnapped one person from Manikchhari 
last December and another person from Kutubchhari in January. 
The kidnapping and killing of Bengalees by the Shanti Bahini 
continues. 
  Perhaps, the members of the so-called Shanti Bahini and the 
Pahari Chhatra Parishad [Hill Students Council] who are 
followers of Upendra Lal Chakma and Santu Larma [both leaders of 
the tribal insurgents] are carrying on these nefarious 
activities to obstruct the repatriation of tribal refugees to 
CHTs from India's Tripura State. Though the Pahari Chhatra 
Parishad has appealed to the tribal population of CHTs not to 
celebrate the Biju [religious festival of the tribals], the 
tribals have not responded. The Shanti Bahini wanted to prove 
to the world that religious minorities are being repressed in 
Bangladesh by preventing the observance of this festival. In 
the past, the Shanti Bahini had made several false propaganda in 
this regard both at home and abroad. 
  At present, the Shanti Bahini has set up several bases 
inside 
the CHTs. They have this opportunity as the security forces 
have been withdrawn from the border areas. Apart from Tripura, 
the Shanti Bahini has recently opened new camps in Haryana [a 
state of India] for training newly-recruited youths. These 
terrortist elements have the opportunity to organize themselves 
due to the general amnesty declared by the Bangladesh Government 
and the closure of several army camps in the region. It is 
learnt that arrangements are being made to withdraw more army 
camps from the CHTs. This is a matter of grave concern. After 
visiting the CHTs, the governor of Tripura, Romesh Bhandari, 
said he believed that the situation in the region is very 
favorable for repatriation. Despite this, the Shanti Bahini 
which is responsible for killing over 25,000 people in the CHTs 
is making efforts to foil the repatriation of the second batch 
of tribal refugees from Tripura to the CHTs. The Shanti Bahini 
has become desperate to launch massive destruction in the region 
to foil the peace initiative under any pretext. It may be 
mentioned that at least 25 percent of the women of Bangipara 
[village of CHTs] have become widows due to the activities of 
the Shanti Bahini. 
  After the peace talks held last November, the killer Shanti 
Bahini launched a series of attacks and killed a large number of 
the members of the security forces, the police, the Bangladesh 
Rifles [paramilitary force], and Bengalees living in the region. 
So far, it has not been possible to record all their 
activities. Reliable sources, however, said such incidents 
exceed 200. They said the aim of the Shanti Bahini is to foil 
the peace process and complicate the situation. The reason is 
that the leaders of the Shanti Bahini and the Jana Sanghati 
Samity [political wing of Shanti Bahini] are gradually becoming 
frustrated with India. 
  Recently, the Shanti Bahini has established links with the 
secessionist forces in seven Indian states including Tripura, 
Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland, and Meghalaya. Due to this, the 
Shanti Bahini has become a problem for India. According to 
observers, Indian leaders are therefore in favor of driving out 
the Shanti Bahini from their country. They add that owing to 
this the Shanti Bahini has become desperate to let loose 
anarchy. The people of the CHTs have become fed up with the 
large-scale extortion of the Shanti Bahini. Several protest 
rallies against the activities of the Shanti Bahini have been 
held in different parts of the region. 
  Severe discontent prevails among the Bengalees living in the 
three districts of Chittagong Hill Tracts. They are fighting 
against the demand of the tribals to curb their rights and 
convert them to second-class citizens. The quota for the 
representation of the Bengalees in the district councils of the 
CHTs is very small. The opportunity for the education of their 
children is also very limited. In contrast, there are special 
quotas in educational institutions for the tribals. Bengalees 
do not have the right to purchase land in the CHTs. On the 
other hand, the government has surrendered to the demand of the 
Shanti Bahini and is forcibly evicting thousands of Bengalees 
from their homes. This is being widely criticized. A massive 
rally was held last November in Rangamati town under the 
auspices of the Parbattya Gano Parishad which clearly stated 
that the people of the CHTs will not accept any talks with the 
murderous Shanti Bahini. They added that if any talks are 
necessary, then it should be held with the Parbattya Gano 
Parishad, an organization of peace-loving people from the three 
districts of the CHTs. In this regard, they also handed over a 
memorandum to the government. In this memorandum, the Bengalees 
have demanded the abolition of special tribal quotas and the 
introduction of hill quotas. 
  On April 10, a half-day strike was observed peacefully in 
the 
three districts of the CHTs -- Rangamati, Bandarban, and 
Khagrachhari -- at the call of the Parbattya Gano Parishad, 
which demanded that the Bengalees kidnapped by the Shanti Bahini 
be released. Addressing a rally held on the occasion, the Gano 
Parishad leaders declared that a solution to the CHTs problem is 
only possible through the implementation of the seven-point and 
18-point proposals they have given. They added that the 
repression of the Bengalees in the CHTs, which is also a 
Bangladesh territory, will not be tolerated. 
  A rumor is being heard saying that the government has 
recently decided to hand over to the district councils of the 
CHTs the responsibility of dealing with land matters in the 
region. If this is done, then this will be equal to giving the 
Bengalees a death blow. It is learnt that the Bengalees are 
preparing to resist this move. The Jatiyatabadi Landless 
Organization, which has about 10,000 landless families living in 
Khagrachhari, are planning to lay siege to the local district 
council office to press the implementation of their five-point 
demands. 
  The chairman of the Parbattya Gano Parishad, Jalaluddin 
Ahmed, and the secretary general, Moniruzzaman Monir, in a joint 
statement criticized the governor of Tripura, Romesh Bhandari, 
for saying that he is unaware that secessionist training is 
being given to the misled Chakma [tribals of CHTs] youths at the 
(Maini) Mission Academy and other secret places in Agartala. 
They alleged that the administration in Chittagong Hill Tracts 
is being compelled to work in accordance with the prescription 
of the local leftists and the so-called international human 
rights organizations. They added that the MP from Khagrachhari, 
Kalpa Ranjan Chakma, and Upendra Lal Chakma are playing a game 
centering on the Chakma refugee issue. The Parbattya Gano 
Parishad has evidence that these two people have links with the 
Shanti Bahini. Hence, they cannot be friends of Bangladesh. 
The leaders of the parishad in their statement has called on 
the government to call a round-table conference at the national 
level to resist the conspiracy and terrorism going on in the 
CHTs.

  [Text] Recent developments in Bangladesh's foreign 
relations have raised several questions in people's minds. 
These questions are not being widely discussed due to the 
prevailing political crisis in the country. The visit of the 
governor of the Tripura state of India, Romesh Bhandari, to 
Dhaka in the third week of April and the subsequent six-day long 
visit of the Chief of Staff of the Indian Armed Forces, General 
Bipin Chandra Joshi, to Bangladesh has had an impact on the 
politics of the country. Earlier, a review was made regarding 
the tour of Bhandari to Bangladesh, but one aspect of his visit 
was not discussed. Bhandari made this visit as a special envoy 
of New Delhi. It is needless to say that some changes have been 
observed in New Delhi's policy towards Dhaka, but these changes 
are in the interest of India. During this visit, talks were 
held with Bhandari regarding the sharing of the waters of the 
Ganges River. Bangladesh has identified this water sharing 
issue as the main impediment towards the solution of other 
problems with India. It is understood that India is now giving a 
fresh thought on the water sharing issue. Apart from this, 
India wants to improve its ties with Bangladesh to maintain its 
dominance in South Asia. Let us see how India wants to achieve 
this objective. For instance, India has softened its stand on 
the water sharing issue after Bangladesh started taking the 
necessary preparations to raise this matter at the United 
Nations. At this stage it is necessary that Bangladesh should 
be more cautious. Asafuddowla -- the official -- who strongly 
advocated the cause of raising this issue at the United Nations 
has now deviated from his earlier stand. Does this indicate 
that there is a possibility of resolving this water sharing 
issue with India through bilateral means? Asafuddowla is not 
acceptable to the Indians. Did the government make a different 
evaluation of him with India? People have a question in this 
regard. 
  India does not want to restrict the forging of better ties 
only to the spheres of water sharing and market economy. It 
also wants to expand ties in the area of regional security. 
Many people think that this was one of the objectives behind 
the visit of General Joshi to Bangladesh. Official sources 
however described it as a routine visit. Actually, this visit 
had an important aim. 
  It is understood that India wants to capture Bangladesh's 
military market. Though India has always opposed the military 
development of Bangladesh, they now want to "dump" the military 
equipment built in their country on Bangladesh. It is understood 
that during his visit, General Joshi not only talked about 
military cooperation but also mentioned the export of military 
hardware to Bangladesh. At present, Bangladesh receives a large 
chunk of its military equipment from China in the form of 
grants. Later, these grants are waived. If new spare parts are 
needed then Bangladesh imports them from China. India has said 
that China is providing old equipment to Bangladesh, but it 
[India] will provide her with new equipment. Hence, Bangladesh 
will not need to import any spare parts. 
  Earlier, India had proposed to Bangladesh the holding of 
joint military and naval exercises. Bangladesh has not yet 
conveyed its decision to India. Many people believe that if 
joint military exercises are held then India will be able to 
develop contacts in the Bangladesh Army. Others say that if 
joint exercises are held then Bangladesh will be able to 
acquaint herself with the techniques of the Indian Army and also 
become aware of their motives. Joint military exercises between 
India and Bangladesh will create a new wave in regional 
politics. It is believed that this may have a negative impact. 
  At present, Bangladesh is in need of an Armed Personnel 
Carrier, APC. This carrier is used in different parts of the 
world by the UN peacekeeping forces. The soldiers of Bangladesh 
are not very familiar with these carriers. To ensure 
Bangladesh's future participation in UN peacekeeping operations, 
its army should learn how to use these carriers. At present, 
India wants to supply these APC's to Bangladesh but a political 
decision has to be taken in Bangladesh whether or not to bring 
these from India. 
  General Joshi held talks on this issue during his visit to 
Dhaka. India is also concerned about the tribal insurgency in 
the northeastern parts of that country, which is being aided by 
Pakistan. India believes that the Inter Services Intelligence 
of Pakistan is abetting these rebellions and it [New Delhi] is 
seeking the assistance of Bangladesh to curb these activities. 
India also believes that these terrorists are being trained in 
Bangladesh, but the latter has repeatedly refuted this 
allegation. Despite this, India is not willing to accept the 
denial of Bangladesh. A report published by the Indian Army in 
April 1993 alleged that Bangladesh is supporting the rebels in 
the northeastern states of India. India believes that the 
tribal insurgents are using Bangladeshi soil to carry on their 
activities in India. It has been learnt from reliable sources 
that these issues came up for discussion during the visit of 
General Joshi. 
  During the visit of General Joshi to Bangladesh, Indian 
planes violated Bangladeshi airspace and India massed its troops 
along the border of Lalmonirhat District while Bangladesh was 
conducting excavation work along two of its rivers -- the Feni 
River and the Dharala River. The foreign secretary of 
Bangladesh once said that the government is observing the 
situation along the border. He also questioned newsmen about 
the veracity of newspaper reports published in this connection. 
However, after this the Home Ministry lodged a strong protest 
with India centering the tension along the border. It is now 
known that Bangladesh apprised the visiting Indian Army chief 
about these incidents. People want to know about these issues. 
It is known to all that India had always opposed Bangladesh for 
moving in an independent direction.

  [Text] Tripoli, al Maa' [May] 18, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- Ever since it was established, American Central Intelligence 
has played the role of a saboteur, which has been extremely 
dangerous in international relations and internal affairs 
throughout the world which assumed that the end of the Second 
World War would bring an end to antagonistic conflicts, 
conspiracIes and plots. This after the people gave their lives 
and all they had, involved in a conflict which they had nothing 
to do with. It was a war conducted by the Europeans where the 
United States attempted to fulfill its expansionist aspirations 
and to extend beyond the borders of the American continent. A 
role which expanded and was undertaken using all types of 
methods, the most dangerous being American Central Intelligence, 
which is considered, without exaggeration, to be the den of 
terrorism in the world, responsible for criminal activities 
which threatened to disrupt stability in the world. It is they 
who are responsible for the coup d'etats in independent nations 
-- examples of this abound: Iran in the 1950's, Cuba in the 
1960's, then Chile, Panama, Peru, Argentina and [words 
indistinct]. 
  American intelligence is also responsible for the killing of 
thousands of people, the assasination of dozens of leaders and 
national figures, such as Nkrumah, Lumumba, Allende, Maurice 
Bishop and dozens of assasination attempts against Castro, [word 
indstinct] Nasir, Col Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and other leaders 
in the ugliest scenes of terrorism and conspiracy. The CIA gave 
support to and trained the terrorist rebel groups opposed to 
these leaders peoples. The CIA set up training camps specially 
for these terrorists to prepare them to carry out psychological 
warfare, sabotage and bloodshed, such as happened in El 
Salvador, Nicaragua, Angola and other regions. The CIA planned 
and administered America's wars and its intervention in foreign 
countries. The CIA was directly responsible for the defeats the 
United States sufferred in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bolivia and 
Somalia. It is they who completely disregarded the allegations 
propagated by American administrations concerning the protection 
of `human rights'. The CIA set up military dictatorships and 
lent support to dictatorships, the minority fascist regimes and 
aborted the national experiments of nations to ensure that these 
nations remained in servitude, injustice, repression without 
being able to achieve their freedom or progress. The 
trafficking in drugs between nations even the United States 
[sentence as received]. This is the most heinous crimes 
committed by the CIA as well as its relations with drug 
trafficking gangs the most notorious being the Medeilin gang in 
Colombia and the Contra gangs in Nicaragua. In addition, there 
is the CIA's links with the Mafia. 
  These incidents and links have multiplied until becoming 
outright terrorism organised against independent nations by 
imposing economic, military and scientific restrictions and 
threatening to starve these nations and brandishing the threat 
of direct military intervention. They use financial pressure, 
stir up problems and plot coups thus, the targetted nations find 
themselves victims of this terrorism of the CIA. This is why 
the world is constantly in a state of anxiety and trepidation in 
response to these actions carried out by the CIA, actions which 
appear to be the precursor to the establishment of a world 
dictatorial police system under the control of the United States 
where freedom, justice, and democracy have no worth and where 
colonialism will be restored.

  [Text] Tripoli, 12 May (JANA) -- A source at the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation commented on the U.S. Administration's claims, 
reported by the [foreign] media, accusing several countries of 
supporting terrorism. He said: Inclusion of the Great 
Jamahiriyah in such claims and allegations and the concoction of 
accusations against it is not a new thing. It has become one of 
the hallmarks of the conspiracy against the Libyan Arab people 
in order to exert pressure on its choices and to force it to 
serve certain interests which are known to everyone. 
  Concerning the issue of terrorism and other related matters 
which have been used by the Western powers to serve their 
interests in the world, we wish to explain the following points: 
  1. The Great Jamahiriyah, which is eager to see 
international peace and security established on solid bases 
which will help relations between peoples of the world to be 
based on equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in 
internal affairs as well as the nonuse of violence in resolving 
disputes, has been calling on the international community to 
overcome negative aspects [in international relations], such as 
the phenomenon of terrorism, by defining it, analyzing the 
reasons for it, and combatting it. 
  2. The Great Jamahiriyah is another victim of terrorism, 
particularly the state terrorism which has been used against it 
for years, a matter which has claimed tens of innocent victims 
as well as causing material damage. It reached its zenith 
during the U.S.-Atlantist aggression against the innocent 
inhabitants of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, as well as 
against the brother leader of the revolution and his family. 
This was a serious international precedent, condemned by the UN 
General Assembly in successive resolutions. 
  3. The Great Jamahiriyah reacted to the U.S. 
Administration's 
claims on terrorism with clear and public statements, documented 
by international and regional organizations, in which they 
condemned terrorism in all its forms. All international 
organizations and bodies highly praised this stand. 
  4. The Great Jamahiriyah, in a bid to refute American 
claims, 
asked the UN secretary-general to take appropriate measures to 
expose the falsehood of such claims.

  [Text] Tripoli, 12 May 1994, JANA -- AL-SHAM has affirmed 
that any exchange of interests, tourists, and friendship is 
merely a cover being used by Western powers to sneak in caravans 
of spies and agents as well as to set up bases to be used for 
planning dirty operations and the gathering of information. 
  It pointed out in an article published in today's issue that 
the latest of those who entered our country for innocent reasons 
was a German tourist. He entered Libya, but after being 
involved in a traffic accident he turned to be the director of a 
department at the German intelligence. This confirms that as 
soon as a Westerner is involved in an accident or if he dies in 
our Arab homeland his government swiftly announces publicly 
through various media organs that he is a spy. 
  Under the header "They Are All Spies," AL-SHAMS says: Many 
Westerners have been entering our Arab region legally and for 
other public purposes. They are traders, tourists, commercial 
representatives, businessmen, diplomats, or workers in the 
so-called humanitarian agencies. They all claim that they are 
in love with the East. Arab countries open their doors for them 
by extending to them the renown Arab hospitality, the warmth of 
Eastern feelings, and a will to exchange with them friendship 
and interests. 
  The paper AL-SHAMS affirms that, if true, this a required 
and 
desired logical thing. However, the West always reveals to us a 
different face of those tourists, traders, diplomats, and 
humanitarian organization officials. The West reveals their 
true identity when it happens that one of them becomes involved 
in a road accident, an aggression, a disappearance, or a 
kidnapping by unknown persons. Then the state of the person 
involved hurriedly reveals his true identity and announces that 
the person in question is a spying intelligence officer, or the 
head of a spying network for his country, or an official of an 
administration of this network. 
  This happened in Lebanon, and everybody remembers the 
Western 
nationals who were kidnapped as civilians holding various 
functions. The Western news media themselves revealed their true 
identity as intelligence officers. Had this been a one-time 
incident, or related to just one Western country, we would have 
thought of good intentions and the matter would have stayed 
there. But the repetition of admissions of these repeated 
incidents involving several countries reveals a remarkable 
phenomenon that calls for thought and begs the following 
question: Why does the West send us only its intelligence 
officers and men? Americans entered Lebanon for apparently 
innocent and humanitarian causes, including religious purposes, 
and after their kidnapping, America announced that they were 
intelligence men on a spying mission. 
  Frenchmen also entered Lebanon for the same reasons. 
Englishmen entered Iraq and then Britain announced, after they 
had disappeared, that they were intelligence officers. 
  The last of those who entered our country for innocent 
reasons was a German tourist who entered Libya and was involved 
in a traffic accident, and lo and behold he turned out to be a 
department head in the German intelligence services. 
  Thus, with every accident or death of a Westerner in our 
Arab 
homeland his state quickly offers an official admission from the 
government through various media to the effect that the person 
concerned was a spy. 
  This frequency and repetition of the phenomenon confirms to 
us that all nationals from foreign states who enter our country 
are intelligence officers or agents for those states and that 
they move to achieve base objectives by carrying out acts of 
sabotage, sowing discords, spreading rumors, and affecting the 
morale of our nation. 
  [Passage indistinct]...and the building of bases to plan the 
dirty operations and gather information. 
  Can we now trust any Westerner who enters our country? And 
do we have the right to give them a friendly welcome and warm 
hospitality?

  [Text] The installation of the Transitional National 
Council is expected to take place on 18 May. The news was 
carried by the Algerian news agency [APS], which quoted a 
well-informed source. The same source added that the 
Transitional National Council will be made up of 178 members, 22 
of whom will be leaders of political parties and 21 others 
leaders of associations. 
  Over to Aicha Degha for more details: 
  The Transitional National Council is a legislative body that 
will reinforce the constitutional apparatus stipulated in the 
document of consensus, which in turn constitutes a point of 
reference for the transitional period. This transitional period 
will last three years before a return to the electoral process. 
  According to the APS dispatch, the seats of some political 
parties that did not take in the national dialogue conference 
will remain vacant. The distribution of seats according to age 
shows that 52 members are 40 years old at the most and that the 
youngest member of the transitional national council was born in 
1969, while the oldest was born in 1918. 
  These figures indicate that the council takes into account 
all age groups. Moreover, many members of this body are highly 
educated university graduates.

<F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn and Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad will meet in Damascus Thursday [19 May] where the two 
leaders are expected to discuss the latest developments in the 
Middle East peace process, official sources said. 
  The King was quoted as saying that there will be a 
"Jordanian-Syrian summit in Damascus on Thursday," in his 
meeting with representatives of blocs and committees of the 
Lower House of Parliament Monday. 
  His announcement, according to parliamentary sources, came 
after the King briefed the deputies on Jordan's "great 
satisfaction with the level of Jordanian-Syrian coordination" 
over the Middle East peace process and on the bilateral level. 
  The King was also quoted as saying that his satisfaction 
with 
Syrian coordination did not extend to the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) with which, he said, "coordination is much 
below the expected standard." 
  But despite this, the King also underscored Jordan's 
insistence that the "Palestinians plan for themselves and take 
their own decisions." 
  Jordan, the King said, will continue to extend support to 
the 
PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
people." 
  The King, according to the sources, underlined the Kingdom's 
continued commitment to the "comprehensiveness of the solution 
of the Middle East problem" and that Jordan will not enter the 
"race" on the different tracks to sign agreements before fully 
negotiating the points leading up to that agreement. 
  "The King said Jordan will not sign a peace agreement before 
fully neogtiating all the details leading up to that agreement," 
one parliamentary source said. 
  The King told the deputies Jordan had always maintained its 
position that no peace can be comprehensive "without Arab 
coordination." 
  That is why Jordan, the King was quoted as telling the 
deputies, "had always put nationalism above patriotism." 
  The King's message was that the Kingdom will continue to 
deal 
with developments in the peace process "from a nationalist point 
of view rather than from its own narrow interests," as one 
deputy put it. 
  On another front, deputies interviewed by the JORDAN TIMES 
said, the King's public statement that Jordan was committed to 
maintain its democratisation process was in response to 
complaints voiced by the deputies over how the House was 
portrayed in the official media, particularly television. 
  According to parliamentary sources, Irbid Deputy 'Abd 
al-Razzaa Tubayshat raised the issue of how TV coverage could 
instill in people's mind "the message that Parliament was being 
criticised for the way it handles its duties." 
  Parliamentary sources said that the King resonded by 
dispelling any criticism of the House and reiterating the 
Kingdom's commitment to democratisation "because it is linked to 
the Arab people's dignity, freedom and right to participation in 
building their present and making their future." 
  The official news agency, Petra, reported Monday that the 
King called on the parliamentarians to continue their 
distinguished work in the fields of legislation and monitoring 
government performance, pointing to the importance of having 
well-defined relations among the executive, legislative and 
judicial authorities.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that the sons of 
Palestine would always remain in the heart and that they are 
worthy of appreciation and respect, especially those who adhere 
to their land and remain steadfast on it. We have no ambition, 
aim, or purpose other than the return of right to its people and 
owners on their national soil and the achievement of a 
comprehensive and just peace, which future generations can 
accept, safeguard, and defend in an honorable and secure life. 
  His majesty added: We in Jordan are one family of various 
origins and are cohesive in the homeland of the free people. 
Man is valued by the sacrifices he has offered and will offer 
in the future by confronting the challenges and carrying out the 
national duty. 
  His majesty also stressed that Jerusalem and the holy 
shrines 
would remain in our conscience and that we will continue to work 
so that they will be for us all with God's sovereignty 
prevailing and so that these holy lands become a source of 
enlightenment, as they used to be in the past. 
  His majesty's statements came when he received at the Royal 
Hashemite Court today a delegation from the Arabs of Nazareth, 
Akko, Galilee, the Triangle, and the Negev, who came to Jordan 
to extend condolences to his majesty and the honorable Hashemite 
family on the death of Queen Mother Zayn al-Sharaf, beseeching 
Almighty God to have mercy on her soul, grant her paradise, and 
inspire patience to his majesty and the honorable Hashemite 
family.

  The issue is an internal Lebanese affair and no country can

with Israel cannot be equated with other Lebanese militias that 
were disbanded and assimilated. The former are traitors and 
must stand trial in Lebanese courts, Dallul stated.

  [Text] New York, May 17, INA--Several international 
dignitaries now visiting the United Nations called for the 
lifting of the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  Speaking at a press conference here today, the dignitaries 
called for the immediate lifting of the embargo and ending the 
sufferings of the Iraqi people. They submitted a written appeal 
to the UN secretary general urging the Security Council to 
implement Article 22 of its Resolution 687 which provide for the 
lifting of the embargo after Iraq's compliance to its 
obligations. 
  Among the dignitaries that had taken part in the press 
conference were 'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat member of the Jordanian 
House of Notables, Mr. Baham Singh, chairman of the Non-Aligned 
Youth Conference, the former ambassador of Mexico, Canadian 
professor 'Abd-al-Haq Abu-Bakr, Prof. Marta Mandavalo of Athens 
Univesity and the Iraqi Permanent Delegate to the United Nations 
Mr. Nizar Hamdun. 
  Replying to questions put by journalists, Mr. Hamdun said 
the 
American Administration is the only party that rejects the 
implementation of provisions of the Security Council resolutions 
adding that Iraq has implemented all what concerns provisions of 
the weapons section of Resolution 687. Iraq's demand to lift 
the embargo falls within the provisions of that resolution 
itself. 
  The Iraqi ambassador said Iraq rejects the limited selling 
of 
its oil and having supervisors over the distribution of food 
materials. 
  The Arab and Iraqi community in New York assembled here on 
Monday under the banner of Iraq and denounced the perpetuation 
of the economic embargo.

<F P=106> [Article by Taha al-Basri: "Pelletreau's Allegations"] </F>
  [Text] It has become obvious to political observers that 
the U.S. Administration's repetition of the discordant tune that 
Iraq is still threatening the Gulf states and that it has not 
abandoned its ambitions to dominate the region is backed by 
Zionist and Masonic elements which use people like Pelletreau, 
U.S. assistant secretary of state for foreign affairs; Anthony 
Lake, Martin Indyk, and others, as tools which they manipulate 
whenever they want to create a state of tension in the region 
that will ultimately serve U.S. and Zionist interests. 
  It is clear that Pelletreau's statements during his current 
tour of the Gulf about the possibility of Iraqi rearmament are 
intended to scare the Gulf states and to guarantee continued 
U.S. domination of these states, the conclusion of more arms 
deals with them, and therefore the gradual plundering of their 
wealth. 
  This is because Pelletreau and the others know very well 
that 
Iraq, which fought grinding battles in the confrontation against 
Iranian aggression for eight years, is not an element of threat 
to the Arab Gulf states or to the security of the region, but is 
a basic factor for ensuring the requirements of security and 
stability for the region, as proven in the past when Iraq 
protected, with the blood of its sons, the Arab Gulf states from 
the greed and evils of expansionist Iranian policy. Were it not 
for that brave Iraqi stand, these states would be in a different 
situation today. Therefore, drawing a parallel between Iraq and 
Iran today is a clear twisting of historical facts. 
  By his allegations, Pelletreau only tries to tell and 
convince the Gulf states that they are in continuous need of 
U.S. protection through the conclusion of joint defense pacts 
and the purchase of surplus arms from U.S. arsenals, which they 
do not need to defend their security. 
  This is because what is threatening the Gulf is not Iraq but 
the U.S. presence, which is continuously seeking only its 
interests, without being concerned about any other interests, as 
past experiences have proven in various parts of the world. The 
United States will definitely leave the region once it finds 
that its interests no longer require its continuous presence in 
it, as has happened in several cases. 
  It is natural for Pelletreau not to warn the states of the 
region about the real danger threatening them, namely, the 
danger of the expansionist regimes the United States itself has 
helped create, as well as the Zionist danger, which is directed 
not only against them, but against all the countries of the Arab 
nation. This is because Pelletreau is manipulated by his 
Zionist overlords as one of its obedient tools. 
  Pelletreau ignores that real danger and frightens the Arab 
Gulf states with an imaginary danger he claims to be coming from 
Iraq. 
  We must not forget that the U.S. Administration always 
creates a false uproar whenever the UN Security Council is about 
to review the unfair blockade on Iraq. The United States is 
determined to shuffle the cards and create tension this time, 
having realized that the initiative is no longer solely in its 
hands, as was the case during the previous review. 
  It is no secret to anyone that the motives behind such U.S. 
allegations are not to achieve security and stability in the 
region, but to plunder its oil resources and serve Zionist aims. 
  The U.S. Administration was behind the ignition of the 
Iran-Iraq War, the arrival of Khomeyni and the supply of arms to 
his regime. The Irangate scandal is only one piece of evidence 
branding the United States with collusion. 
  The United States, and no one else, creates terrorist 
regimes 
to disturb security and stability so it can deploy its forces 
and fleets, occupy the region, and violate all international 
conventions and norms as well as human rights which it falsely 
claims to uphold. 
  So, it is not strange for statements to be released from 
time 
to time by dirty characters such as Pelletreau, Lake, and Indyk 
who, as our Arab people know, are just tools manipulated by 
Zionism and Freemasonry whenever they wish.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 May (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH says the people 
of Iraq have succeeded in holding their ground and resisting all 
attempts to fragment them and send them into oblivion. The 
Iraqis achieved this thanks to the inspiration they derived from 
their long history and from their historic leader Saddam Husayn, 
who imparted to them a growing resolve to go on living, to 
progress, and to preserve their sovereignty and dignity despite 
the destruction, blockade, plotting, and intervention. 
  In an article today, the paper, speaking for the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, adds: The aggressive, conspiratorial, 
and interventionist U.S. policy against Iraq has clearly ended 
in failure. The military aggression has not given the White 
House control over Iraq's will and decisionmaking, nor has Iraq 
weakened from the destruction, hunger, and chaos. 
  The paper wonders about the U.S. interest in insisting on 
following George Bush's policy against Iraq. What political and 
economic gains are there in this policy for the United States? 
This policy has drawn a blank on the ground and has resulted in 
a great burden for the United States, considering the political 
and moral condemnation that has smeared the U.S. reputation. 
  The paper adds: U.S. President Bill Clinton has the right to 
review facts, away from the positions of the defeated Bush. 
This is because Iraq is here to stay, with its will, 
leadership, and resolve. Iraq has finished rebuilding what was 
destroyed by the U.S.-Atlantic aggression and has even 
introduced improvements to it. 
  The paper points out that Bill Clinton, who inherited the 
U.S. Administration, can cast aside the inheritance of Bush's 
aggression and hostility to Iraq, even though Clinton has 
pursued Bush's policy for some time, committed aggression 
against Iraq, and maintained the blockade. 
  The paper concludes that it is the right of the U.S. 
President to brag about opposing the U.S. war against Vietnam. 
He also has the right to say that he inherited the U.S. 
intervention in Somalia. He was the one who decided to withdraw 
U.S. troops from Somalia. Somali sacrifices and resolve also 
contributed to the withdrawal decision.

  [Text] Merchants from Gulf countries are marketing Iraqi 
oil by giving false information about its origin. The oil is 
being sold on international markets at a price considerably 
lower than that recommended by OPEC. The sale of Iraqi oil, 
which is taking place with the knowledge of U.S. intelligence, 
aims to force down the price of oil and give constant signals 
[isharat da'imah] to Baghdad.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 May (INA) -- Baghdad Mayor Tahir 
Muhammad Hassun has stated that the assistance offered by 
specialised health, environment, and human rights organizations 
and agencies has not improved the environment situation in 
Baghdad and has not remedied the increasing shortage suffered by 
the Baghdad municipality services. 
  At a news conference attended by local, Arab, and foreign 
correspondents as well as the INA correspondent, the Baghdad 
mayor said that these organizations have provided the Baghdad 
municipality departments with only 5 percent of what they direly 
needed in the various services sectors. 
  The Baghdad mayor reviewed the direct impact the continued 
imposition of the unjust embargo has had on Iraq and on Baghdad 
in particular, especially the suspension of work in many Baghdad 
city development projects, the piling of garbage in various 
quarters of the city in view of the shortages experienced by the 
municipality in the human and mechanical field since the 
specialized machinery has come down from 800 to 300, with most 
of these out of order. 
  He explained that 500 to 700 tonnes of garbage are daily 
left 
on the streets. This means more than 20,000 tonnes a month. He 
said that the shortage experienced by the various municipality 
services is increasing and that the continued piling of garbage 
on the streets will lead to the spread of many infectious 
diseases. 
  Tahir Muhammad Hassun warned against the impending danger 
that threatens the individual and the environment in Baghdad as 
a result of the spread of diseases stemming from pollution, and 
the overflowing of the sewerage system and how this will cause 
the death of thousands of citizens. 
  The news conference was attended by the deputy mayor and the 
municipality dpartments' directors.

  [Text] Iraq has informed the Arab League that the Saudi and 
Kuwaiti rulers are continuing to provide facilities for U.S., 
British, and French aircraft to violate Iraqi airspace, which 
seriously threatens Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national 
unity. 
  In a letter he addressed yesterday to the Arab League 
secretary general, Iraq's permanent representative to the Arab 
League said that the aircraft violated Iraq's airspace 1-9 May 
after taking off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. During 
this period they carried out 355 hostile air sorties. 
  The Iraqi permanent representative attached to his letter a 
list detailing these violations.

<F P=106> [By Tolle Aram] </F>
  [Text] Salah al-Din, Iraq, May 17 (AFP)--The United Nations 
has warned the two main rival Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq 
that any more fighting between their supporters could jeopardise 
international aid, a UN official told AFP Tuesday [17 May]. 
  UN area security coordinator Stafford Clarry delivered the 
warning Monday to Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, who lead 
respectively the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] and the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]. 
  One hundred people at least were killed in heavy fighting 
between the KDP and the PUK that erupted early this month and 
ended a week ago. 
  Barzani and Talabani "should realise that the international 
community has not chosen to remain in Iraqi Kurdistan .. so 
they can engage in armed conflict among themselves," read 
Clarry's warning. 
  The message, a copy of which was given to AFP, stressed that 
the UN presence aims at providing the Kurds with "protection 
against an external threat", in a reference to Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn's government. 
  The KDP and the PUK have controlled a major part of northern 
Iraq since an uprising following the February 1991 defeat of 
Iraq in the Gulf war. 
  The US and its allies imposed an air-exclusion zone over 
northern Iraq to keep out Iraq warplanes and protect the Kurds. 
  Clarry, an American, said the latest clashes will seriously 
affect the goodwill of donor countries who financially support 
the Kurds. 
  He also said the clashes have stopped or seriously disrupted 
the UN aid programs, including water supplies to villages, food 
distribution and medical services. 
  Most of the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) operating 
in Kurdistan had to stop their activities during the fighting, 
although they were pressing ahead with existing programs. 
  The clashes however "may make it difficult to initiate new 
programs," said Save the Children field director Bronwen Lewis, 
a Briton. 
  The fighting, which the PUK said was triggered by a personal 
dispute, has already had a negative impact on the German NGOs, 
whose coordination and support office in Shaqlawa town was 
ransacked and its Kurdish guards arrested. 
  The head of the office, Eberhard Walde, said he was recalled 
back to Germany.

17 others were injured, including Mir Yaqub, a commander of 
Golboddin's militia. According to the reports from the BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY, the artillery attack took place two nights 
ago in response to the missile attacks carried out by the 
militia's of Golboddin-Dostam, in which the militia's had 
targeted the residential areas of Kabul city. In the course of 
these attacks, in addition to the aforementioned losses, two 
rocket launchers, a DShKS, two PK machine-guns, and several 
militia strongholds were destroyed in the southeast of Kabul. 
  Recently, according to another report, 15 members of 
Dostam's 
militia sold their weapons in Charasiab in Kabul and fled to 
Pakistan via Kandahari bridge located in Mohammad Aqha District, 
Logar Province. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The militia's of Dostam-Golboddin have embarked on 
an all-round attack on Chardara District, Konduz Province, in 
order to compensate for their defeats in the capital and in the 
northern regions during the last few days. The attacks of the 
murderer militia's, accompanied by heavy air bombardment, on the 
residential areas of Konduz and Chardara District, caused loss 
of life and financial damage to people. The militia's also 
resorted to plundering the people's properties, too. 
  The Islamic Army and Mojahedin embarked on a successful 
military operation this morning at 0500 in order to foil the 
attacks by militia's of criminal Golboddin and infidel Dostam. 
As a result of these operations, the coordinated militia's of 
Golboddin-Dostam were cleared from the district of Chardara. In 
the course of these operations more than 100 militia were killed 
and more than 100 militia were arrested. Among militia that 
were killed are General Ahmad and General 'Abdol Samad. General 
Nabi, General Ahmad Ankhoyi, General Saleh, and General 'Abdol 
Wahed, four other members of the murdering militia's of 
Golboddin-Dostam were arrested by mojahedin. During these 
operations more than 300 types of light and heavy weapons were 
either destroyed or captured.

  [Text] Further details have been reported on the military 
operations carried out by the Islamic Army. Quoting an official 
source in the Afghan Defense Ministry, the BAKHTAR INFORMATION 
AGENCY military correspondent reports Golboddin's militias in 
the areas around Konduz Province, along with Dostam's militias, 
resorted to an unsuccessful offensive, supported by heavy air 
bombardment and missiles attack, to disturb peace and security 
in the Konduz Province surroundings. The militias caused 
trouble to the people, plundered properties, and resorted to 
actions against our religion and traditions. The Islamic Army 
forces resorted to a retaliatory attack against the militias and 
embarked on military operations in the district of Chardara. 
During these operations, the militias were pushed back towards 
Tashghorghan from the areas of Konduz Province. The militias 
were cleared from Chardara District and the surroundings of 
Konduz. As a result of these operations, more than 100 militias 
of Golboddin-Dostam were killed, more than 120 arrested, and a 
large number injured. The enemy lost 700 pieces of light and 
heavy weapons, and two of their tanks were burned down. One 
BM-21 system and two ZK-1's also were destroyed.

  [Text] A report from Mazar-e Sharif says that a foreign 
country provides military supplies to Dostam's militias. 
Recently, 20 passenger aircraft delivered Kalashnikov 
ammunition and RPG-type missiles to Mazar-e Sharif airport. 
Sources close to militias say that Dostam-Golboddin's militias 
faced a shortages of arms and ammunition in the recent fighting, 
and that is why they are supplied from abroad. At the present, 
mojahedin of Balkh Province have the airport of Mazar-e Sharif 
under the pressure by heavy weapons in order to prevent the 
airport being used as a means for the continuation of 
foreigners' military interference. 
  Also, the security officials say that a system that was 
guiding the aircraft was fired at by the air forces of the 
Islamic Army in the heights of Pul-e Khomri and was destroyed. 
The destruction of this system fully paralyzes the militias air 
power. Recently, militias had used training aircraft instead of 
fighter planes, and with the destruction of this system they 
have now been deprived of this as well.

  [Excerpts] Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, 
president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has replied to a 
message sent by Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic 
of Armenia, in the following terms: 
  Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic of 
Armenia: I have received Your Excellency's message in which you 
mentioned the participation of a number of irresponsible Afghans 
in the war between your country and the republic of Azerbaijan 
over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Afghan side 
understands the feelings and concerns of the leadership and the 
people of Armenia. 
  Your Excellency, president of the Republic of Armenia: The 
Islamic Government of Afghanistan has experienced the bitter 
taste of occupation and interference by the old Soviet Union. 
For two years this country has been dealing with the negative 
impact of foreign occupation and various interference. Afghans 
are peace-loving people and do not have any interest in 
interfering in other countries' affairs. The presence of a 
number of Afghans participating in the war between your country 
and Azerbiajan has no connection with the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan and the war-torn Afghan nation; and those who have 
taken part as mercenary soldiers do not have any jehadi 
background and have not been in the ranks of Afghanistan's 
mojahedin. 
  Mr. President, it is with regret that I have to inform you 
and through you the Armenian nation that a number of 
warmongering groups have, on the instructions of foreigners, 
acted to promote political and social instability in Afghanistan 
and have employed a number of Afghan workers for financial 
purposes to seek financial sources to support the militias 
associated with the old Soviet Union, and have dragged them to 
take part in the war between your country and Azerbaijan. 
[sentence as heard] [passage omitted] 
  Your Excellency, the presence of a number of mercenaries and 
dealers in the name of Afghanistan's mojahedin in the war that 
you have mentioned cannot spoil the relations between 
Afghanistan and Armenia. The Afghan side is striving to halt as 
soon as possible these inhuman dealings of a number of rebels, 
whose profits have been and will be used for activities against 
national security and political stability in Afghanistan. 
Taking this opportunity, I wish health, long life, and success 
to your excellency, and the welfare of Armenian people. 
  [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan

  [Text] A Foreign Ministry spokesman has termed the Saudi 
authorities' prevention of the performance of the Disavowal of 
Polytheists ceremony as breach of promise and condemned it. 
  Referring to the Oman agreement between the foreign 
ministers 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia concerning the 
marking of the Day of the Disavowal of Polytheists, the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said: Not only is disregarding that 
agreement breaking a promise by the Saudi authorities; 
preventing the Disavowal of Polytheists, while Muslims are being 
subjected to oppression and injustice by infidels and 
polytheists, has no political-ideological justification either. 
  Expressing deep regret about the preventive measures of the 
Saudi authorities, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said such 
actions are like raising objections and imposing restrictions on 
the freedom of action of pilgrims of the House of God to perform 
the political-ideological hajj rituals and an effort to render 
the Abrahamite hajj meaningless.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 
Khamene'i has consented to the cancellation of the holding of 
the antipathy rally in response to a letter sent to the leader 
by his representative and the head of the Iranian pilgrims Mr. 
Reyshahri. It is worth reminding that the Saudi security 
officials, by creating obstructions and by stationing forces in 
combat gear and surrounding the headquarters of the 
representative of the leader in the holy city of Mecca, are the 
main factors in the adoption of the far-sighted decision by the 
leader of the Islamic revolution. This is so because the recent 
instructions of the leader of the Islamic revolution in 
connection with the holding of the hajj ceremony included the 
point that the Saudi officials should not be allowed to use any 
pretext for breaking the sanctity of the holy House of God. 
  As has been cited in Mr. Reyshahri's telegram this year too, 
the devoted and vigilant pilgrims from Iran and other countries 
were ready to raise the secret banner of deliverance from the 
idolaters and arrogance in the land of revelation by taking 
inspiration from guidelines of the late Imam Khomeyni, peace be 
upon him. But the Saudi military and security forces in a 
provocative and irresponsible manner, and three days ahead of 
the antipathy rallies surrounded the headquarters of the 
representative of the leader and began controlling all movements 
of the pilgrims, thus preventing the divine obligation from 
being carried out. 
  It is surprising as well as shocking that the Muslims are 
banned from holding the antipathy rally and announcing 
deliverance from the pagans near the House of God. The Saudi 
forces prevented the announcement of deliverance from polytheism 
and arrogance headed by the U.S. and Israel by controlling the 
movement of pilgrims around the headquarters of the leader's 
representative and even prevented the headquarter's vehicles 
from leaving or entering the area. 
  The oppressed silence of the world Muslims in the House of 
God is far more effective than any cry and stronger than any 
storm. The message of the Islamic revolution has now crossed 
the geographical boundaries of Iran and has reawakened the 
Muslims across the globe, giving them self-confidence. Last but 
not least, the hajj rituals and rallies such as the antipathy 
rally, on the one hand, provide the world Muslims to become 
aware of their problems from close quarters and on the other, by 
announcing their indignation over the Zionist domination, raise 
the outcry of their common sufferings. Obviously unless these 
sufferings and pains are treated properly to provide a basic 
cure, any cry can only serve to be a temporary solution.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received Mr. 
Vasim Jaffery, the Pakistani minister of state for economic 
affairs [name and title as heard] and head of the two countries' 
joint committee. 
  At the meeting, the president emphasized the expansion of 
economic cooperation between the two countries in line with 
diplomatic ties. He said: Although there are grounds for 
cooperation between Asian countries, it is not at the expected 
level. Perhaps the tendency to cooperate with the West and lack 
of complete confidence and trust in the natural facilities and 
potentials in the region is one of the factors preventing its 
realization. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the necessity for the two 
countries' joint committee to become more active to present to 
the world a suitable example of regional cooperation. 
  At the meeting, Jaffery said: Implementing the agreements 
reached between Iran and Pakistan, particularly those reached 
during Mrs. Benazir Bhutto's visit, are always stressed by the 
Pakistani Government.

  [Text] Zahedan (Sistan-Baluchestan), May 14, IRNA -- The 
8th Iran-Pakistan joint border commission opened here Saturday 
[14 May] to explore problems and difficulties of the two 
countries' border provinces in countering bandits and drug 
smugglers. 
  Deputy chief minister of Pakistan's Baluchistan Province who 
is heading the delegation, Shirdel, praised Iran's law 
enforcement personnel for their decisive campaign against drug 
dealers. 
  Referring to Islamabad's attempts to eradicate narcotics and 
drug trafficking, he stressed that Pakistan does not produce any 
type of narcotics, and that these drugs are being mass produced 
in neighbouring Afghanistan and smuggled into his country. 
  According to him Pakistan is also serious in its fight 
against drug dealers despite its lack of proper facilities and 
equipment to deal with them on the long border it shares with 
Afghanistan. 
  Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan Province borders Pakistan's 
Baluchestan Province. 
  Head of the Iranian delegation, Vajihollah Aqa-Taqi who is 
in 
charge of security-political affairs at the governor-general's 
office of Sistan-Baluchestan Province, said Iran will spare no 
efforts in promotion of economic links between the neighbouring 
provinces. 
  He assured that Iran will seriously deal with all activities 
against Pakistan at the joint borders and will never let border 
be a base for subversion inside Pakistan. 
  He stressed that Iran expects reciprocal treatment from 
Pakistan and particularly officials in charge of Baluchistan 
Province in this regard. 
  Outlining Iran's success in the drug campaign, Aqa-Taqi 
announced that the law enforcement personnels have seized over 
10 tons of narcotics in the border regions during the first 
month of the Iranian calendar Farvardin which ended on April 20. 
Iran-Pakistan joint border commission which is being held bi- 
annually will last 3 days.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the Foreign Politics Desk: "Which </F>
Reality?!"] 
  [Text] Some time ago, an 11-member delegation of diplomats 
in New Delhi travelled to Kashmir Province after extensive 
publicity by the Indians. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran's ambassador in New Delhi, who 
was one of the members of this delegation, criticized the 
obstructionist behavior of the Indian officials and their 
attempts to prevent the main objective of the trip, which was to 
assess the true situation in Kashmir. 
  In view of this stance, the Indian External Affairs Ministry 
summoned the Iranian ambassador and informed him that "his 
allegations were not in conformity with the facts." 
  We wish to draw the attention of the Indian authorities to 
two important points: 
  1. The Indian authorities for many years have opposed the 
visit by Iranian journalists to the crisis-ridden Kashmir 
region. Now that a diplomatic delegation has gone to that 
region, the Indian Government is trying to cover up the pressure 
it is exerting on Kashmiri Muslims by resorting to fallacious 
propaganda and "disseminating news without any truth," despite 
the fact that every day there are alarming reports of disastrous 
occurrences in Kashmir. 
  2. It appears that the Indians did not expect anyone to 
react to the actions of the Indian Armed Forces in Kashmir. 
  Why should the free statements of a diplomat regarding 
Kashmir upset the Indian authorities? If the Indians are 
apprehensive about the revelations of their atrocities in 
Kashmir, they should seek a path other than intimidation. 
  Their allegation that "the Iranian ambassador was the only 
one who complained" does not change anything, as the Indian 
External Affairs Ministry has not refuted his allegations. 
  In any case, the Indian officials should know that one 
cannot 
cover up facts for a prolonged period of time and that the only 
path is to officially grant rights to the people of Kashmir.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- The daily KAYHAN 
INTERNATIONAL here Monday [16 May] wrote that ever since the 
establishment of the Islamic republic in Iran, there has been a 
great emphasis on the importance and the desirability of ties 
with Third World countries specially Africa. 
  Referring to volume of Iran's exports to Africa in 1992, the 
editorial noted that Tehran broke off diplomatic ties with 
Pretoria in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. 
  Following the normalization of ties with post-apartheid 
South 
Africa, the drive to re-establish trade relations with that 
country has gained momentum, the paper remarked. 
  Commenting on the recent trip of Iranian Oil Ministry 
delegation to South Africa, the daily said that while Iran has 
always put an emphasis on trade ties with Africa, South Africa 
can provide a good platform both in terms of trade with it and 
with other African countries. 
  In view of its great human and material resources, it looks 
like South Africa would be the most promising of all African 
countries to establish trade ties with, the article noted adding 
that the first step in this regard can be the resumption of oil 
exports to that country. 
  However, in addition to being a good oil market for Iran, 
South Africa can also provide a promising market for Iran's 
non-oil export products because of their competitive prices, it 
added. 
  In view of its advancement in industry and technology, South 
Africa has also what it takes to meet some of Iran's needs in 
these areas, the editorial concluded.

  [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Mahmoud Mohammadi Monday condemned the Austrian Government's 
granting of an award to sentenced apostate Salman Rushdie and 
interpreted it as background for more disrespect to divine 
religions. 
  The Austrian minister of education and arts recently gave an 
award to the writer of the highly sacrilegious book `The Satanic 
Verses'. 
  The Iranian official said this measure is condemned not only 
by the Islamic republic but also by all world Muslims and 
followers of other divine religions. 
  Rushdie sentenced to death for his crime is in hiding in 
Britain since 1989 with world Muslims determined to bring him to 
justice. 
  The apostate who has hurt the feelings of the world's over 
one billion Muslims, is being backed by certain Western 
countries who from time to time reward him for his misdeed, in 
scant respect of Muslim sentiments.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Secret Deal Between Iraq and Britain"] </F>
  [Text] The committee to survey Britain's secret arms deal 
with Iraq, the Scott Committee, concluded, following its formal 
investigation of British Government officials. Although the 
result of investigation has not been completely revealed, the 
same information which have [word indistinct] proved that the 
Conservative British government is involved in a big secret deal 
arms with Iraq in blatant violation of law. 
  The attention of Judge Scott has been specially drawn to the 
question as to why investigation in the trial of Matrix 
Churchill company managers was stopped in November 1992 under 
the government pressure. This was why the involvement of 
British intelligence service, known as ME6 [as heard] had been 
somehow clear. As the results of Judge Scott investigations 
show ME6 organization had direct connection with Mr. Paul 
Henderson, an accused manager, in the use of gathering of 
informations from Iraq and that regime's arms activities. 
Therefore, according to Scott committee's conclusion, the 
British spying and intelligence agency could not have been 
uninformed of secret arms deal between Britain and Iraq. 
Furthermore, Judge Scott, in his investigations, has come to 
this conclusion that the officials of the Conservative British 
government, by plying with words and making use of various terms 
and interpretations, have been trying to justify their act and 
the breach of law. 
  Nevertheless, one cannot have a clear picture of the British 
Government's extensive support for Iraq in the war imposed on 
the Islamic Republic of Iran until the investigations of Judge 
Scott are published by the end of the current year. The 
Conservative British government's hostility to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran was to the extend that the British Government 
had agreed to be involved in illegal and secret arms deal with 
Iraq. Judge Scott's investigations, which includes gathering of 
200,000 documents and proofs during 400 work hours, are checked 
by the British Government to prevent disclosure of secret 
documents showing the government's inner corruption. But since 
the Scott Committee is popular among people and there is a high 
demand for the disclosure of truth, Judge Scott finds himself, 
as a neutral judge, bound to respect national interest and 
disclosure of truths. 
  For this reason at least part of the Conservative British 
government's inner corruptions and the hypocritical image of its 
statesmen are expected to be put to the public judgement with 
the release of parts of the truth.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Britain--A Base for Terrorism!"] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. The British Government has agreed to the 
establishment of networks to guide the terroristic operations of 
the Monafeqin [hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization, MKO] on its soil. While revealing this, a source 
in the British House of Commons stressed that London has issued 
a permit for the Monafeqin to direct their terroristic 
operations from British soil after Paris had refused their 
request. Thus, Britain has been transformed into a base for the 
Monafeqin terrorists, who will henceforth receive their orders 
directly from London and will embark on crimes and killings. 
[passage omitted] 
  The oppressed Kurds of Iraq have not forgotten that at the 
height of their struggle against the Baghdad regime, the 
Monafeqin terrorists entered the fray suddenly on the side of 
the "executioner of Baghdad" and began massacring and torturing 
the revolutionaries. However, the Monafeqin did not reap any 
benefits from all this mercenary service and crime on behalf of 
Saddam. They incurred the ire of the Kurdish combatants and a 
short while later the Monafeqin's installations were the targets 
of the fury and vengeance of the combatant Kurds and their stay 
in Iraq was terminated. 
  Now that these Monafeqin have entered into London's service 
and have committed themselves to the British Intelligence 
organization, there is a strong likelihood that they will become 
the targets of the hatred and anger of the IRA and the IRA's 
revenge squads will be the nemesis of the remnant elements of 
the Monafeqin. 
  It is interesting to note that the mischief-mongering 
British 
seem helpless before the Irish combatants and will try to use 
the mercenary Monafeqin as their sandbags in their efforts to 
crush the IRA. If all the lackey Monafeqin are killed in the 
process, the mischief-mongering British will have lost nothing. 
[passage omitted] 
  Britain should seriously reply to these questions: Is it 
prepared to accept the consequences of this ill-fated investment 
in the Monafeqin? Does it realize the consequences of such a 
foolish policy and does it take direct responsibility for its 
latest decisions? There is a strong possibility that the 
explosion on Sa'di Avenue in Tehran recently, which resulted in 
human and material losses, was actually directed by Britain. 
  It is not yet clear how London will face the unpleasant 
consequences of its decisions and whether it comprehends what 
the reaction to this unwise step will be. It is difficult to 
predict what the reaction of the families of those martyred by 
the crimes of the Monafeqin will be when they hear of this. 
  It is essential for the Islamic Republic of Iran to stress 
the seriousness of the matter to London; and before London's 
malice provokes a severe and irrevocable reaction, Iran should 
ask the trouble-making British to rectify their deliberate 
mistakes and apologize to the Iranian nation. Otherwise Britain 
will have to take responsibility for its indiscreet decisions.

Hashemi-Rafsanjani said here today that the capacity of the 
discovered gas deposits of the country would be enough for 250 
years. 
  Noting that gas is considered as the best fuel for the 
country, the president said piped gas had been supplied to 240 
cities and towns throughout the country, and that all other 
places should indeed be provided with piped gas. 
  Elsewhere the president said Iran is considered as a steel 
exporter today, and predicted that steel production would reach 
five million tons in the current calendar year. 
  Iran is treading the path of self-reliance in many areas 
including aluminium, copper, and petrochemical industries, he 
added.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR praises the wisdom 
and courage of President Husni Mubarak, who loudly declared that 
Egypt will send no soldier to Yemen. Yemen, the paper says, is 
a country where brothers fight each other and launch air raids 
on northern and southern cities and villages. 
  In its editorial today, the paper says President Mubarak's 
decision to send no Egyptian or Arab forces to Yemen was made 
because any role these forces might play could endanger them or 
subject them to accusations from rival Yemeni parties. It adds: 
The harm would be great and could complicate the crisis in a 
tragedy that no one can resolve except those who created it. 
  The paper notes that a dialogue with words, not guns and 
tanks, is the only way to resolve the Yemeni crisis. It 
expresses the hope that the rival Yemeni parties will come to 
their senses, replace their weapons with more civilized means, a 
dialogue between brothers, resort to reason, and renounce 
differences to preserve Yemen's unity.

  [Text] After successful talks in Washington, and before 
leaving for Cairo, Defense Minister Field Marshal Muhammad 
Husayn Tantawi announced that his talks with U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry dealt with military cooperation between 
Egypt and the United States and focused on a joint strategy to 
ensure security, stability, and reconstruction in the Middle 
East. He said the talks also dealt with developments in Yemen, 
which he described as very regrettable. 
  The minister expressed Egypt's hope that all sides in Yemen 
will demonstrate self-restraint and use logic to end the 
explosive struggle with a view to preserving the lives of 
innocent people and sparing the states of the region the 
repercussions of this struggle. Field Marshal Tantawi described 
his talks with U.S. congressmen as successful. He said the 
congressmen understand Egypt's importance and role in the 
region, and the U.S. Administration, Congress, and the Pentagon 
appreciate President Mubarak's positions and Egypt's role. 
Tantawi invited the U.S. defense secretary to visit Egypt; 
Perry said he is looking forward to the visit, which he will 
make sometime this year.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak 
received Defense Minister Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi 
at the Presidential Office this morning. Field Marshal Tantawi 
returned to Cairo from Washington yesterday after a visit of 
several days to the United States. 
  Speaking after the meeting, Tantawi said he briefed 
President 
Mubarak on the results of his visit to the United States and his 
meetings with senior military, U.S. Administration, and Congress 
officials. He noted that the U.S. officials expressed their 
appreciation of Egypt and of President Mubarak's role in its 
every aspect, particularly regarding world peace and the 
Israeli- Palestinian Agreement recently signed in Cairo. 
  The defense minister added that his talks in Washington 
covered every current world issue, Egypt's role in the region, 
Egyptian-U.S. military ties and cooperation in the field of 
joint training, and the U.S. military grant to Egypt. He 
described the results of these talks as good. 
  Asked about reports on a reduction in U.S. aid, which will 
be 
directed to East Europe, and how prepared Egypt is to deal with 
such a reduction, the defense minister said the U.S. 
Administration has reduced its own military budget. As a 
result, he added, there was a tendency to reduce foreign aid. 
But considering the role Egypt is playing and in view of its 
importance, its status, and its Armed Forces in the region, I 
hope Egypt will not be affected by such a reduction. 
  Asked about the notion of replacing the U.S. aid with 
cooperation in the field of technology transfer to compensate 
for the loss and whether his talks in Washington dealt with 
this, Field Marshal Tantawi said: It is not an issue of 
replacement; the two things must go together. He noted that 
cooperation exists between Egypt and the United States in every 
field. He added: I have sensed an understanding of Egypt's 
role and position and our bilateral relations are proceeding in 
the right direction, be it in the field of technology transfer, 
aid, joint training, or other areas. 
  Asked if anything new in the field of military cooperation 
was agreed upon with the United States, the defense minister 
said there are procedures concerning the armament and 
modernization of the Armed Forces and U.S. assistance in these 
areas, noting that these procedures follow an established plan 
and that the plan is continuing. 
  Asked if new arms deals were concluded as part of this plan, 
Field Marshal Tantawi said: We operate according to a five-year 
plan, which is proceeding in the right direction.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Salah: "Mubarak Accuses Muslim </F>
Brotherhood of Supporting Terrorism; Al-Hudaybi Stresses 
Renunciation of Violence"] 
  [Excerpt] Cairo -- Signs of a new crisis between the 
Egyptian Government and the Muslim Brotherhood group have 
emerged in the wake of an interview President Husni Mubarak gave 
to the German newspaper DER SPIEGEL, published yesterday. In 
the interview Mubarak described the Muslim Brotherhood as "an 
illegal group supporting most of the terrorists' activities." 
Mubarak's statement provoked varying reactions on the Egyptian 
political scene. 
  Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, spokesman for the Muslim 
Brotherhood, has denied the existence of any link between the 
group and the extremists. He also denied that it supports 
violent and terrorist actions. He told AL-HAYAH that violent 
and terrorist actions have occurred over 25 years, and 
investigations have proved that the Muslim Brotherhood has no 
link with the extremist organizations whose members carried out 
these actions. He stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood "has 
never been implicated in supporting, inciting, or participating 
in actions violating the law. So it is strange for accusations 
to be leveled at it without any evidence." 
  Al-Hudaybi added that "Interior Minister Major General Hasan 
al-Alfi, who is responsible for following up security conditions 
and pursuing those who violate the law, announced in a news 
conference about a month ago that the Muslim Brotherhood has 
nothing to do with any violence or any link with terrorist 
actions. And former Interior Minister 'Abd-al-Halim Musa said 
the same thing." 
  On Mubarak's statement on conditions in Algeria, Al-Hudaybi 
said that "what happened in Algeria was not the result of 
aggression from the groups calling for reenforcing the Islamic 
Shari'ah. It was the result of a military coup against the will 
of the people, who had chosen the Islamists through free 
elections." 
  On the national dialogue called for by Mubarak, Al-Hudaybi 
said: "We have no information about the dialogue issue. 
[Government] officials have announced openly that the Muslim 
Brotherhood will not participate in it. We do not believe it is 
a serious matter, as it was first mentioned eight months ago, 
and no measures have been taken so far to initiate it. If the 
government believed it was important, it would have taken steps 
to initiate it and ensured the participation of all the 
political forces on the Egyptian scene." He said that the 
dialogue "will produce no results." 
  Al-Hudaybi said that the Muslim Brotherhood is subjected to 
security harassment, "and from time to time members of the group 
are arrested and interrogated in imaginary cases, even though 
our position on violence and terrorism is clear and declared."

  [Text] The Muslim Brotherhood has issued a statement 
reiterating its opposition to the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and 
last week's signing ceremony in Cairo for the commencement of 
its implementation. In its statement, the Muslim Brotherhood 
said: "It has become evident that the PLO has given all the 
required concessions. The PLO continued to concede right up to 
the last moment before signing. The PLO has linked itself to 
the Zionist entity by accepting self-rule. Hence, the PLO has 
become a tool of the Zionist hegemony in Palestine and the Arab 
and Islamic region." 
  Continuing, the Muslim Brotherhood said: "The Cairo 
Agreement is not binding on the Muslim brothers, the issue of 
Palestine is the responsibility of all Muslims, and the 
liberation of the holy land in Palestine is the duty of every 
male and female Muslim. Furthermore, the Cairo agreement does 
not achieve the minimum of the just demands of the Palestinian 
people, because the basic issues are still pending, including 
the issues of the displaced, refugees, holy Jerusalem, 
settlements, and the setting up of the Palestinian state on all 
the Palestinian soil." 
  The Muslim Brotherhood called on the Arab and Islamic people 
to support the Palestinian people's jihad by continuing the 
complete boycott of the Zionist entity and reviving the jihad 
spirit among the youth.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 May (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, arrived in Cairo 
from Tunis early today. 
  In an arrival statement, Sha'th said the Palestinians came a 
step closer to their dream of full independence with the 
restoration of control over their land under the leadership of 
the PLO and the Palestine Liberation Army. 
  The next three months, he added, will see the liberation of 
the cities of Nabulus, Hebron, and Ramallah. We hope to achieve 
there what has been achieved in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said. 
He pointed out that Jerusalem is the highest objective and 
dearest hope of the Palestinians but will not be discussed until 
the negotiations on a "final settlement" begin around 15 October. 
  The return of 6,000 officers and soldiers to the Palestinian 
land in Gaza and Jericho will open the door for the return of 
their 35,000 relatives. Some 5,000 more Palestinian cadres are 
also expected to return to Gaza and Jericho. In June, the doors 
will open for the return of approximately 860,000 refugees who 
left their land following the 1967 war, Dr. Sha'th announced. 
  Dr. Sha'th expressed appreciation for the support the 
Palestinians received from President Husni Mubarak and the 
Egyptian people and Government, particularly the Foreign and 
Information Ministries and the Armed Forces. Egypt sacrificed 
some of its valiant sons in the war for Palestine and then stood 
by the side of the Palestinians in the negotiations, he declared. 
  The Palestinian official pointed out that he will enter 
Jericho with president Yasir 'Arafat in the first week of June. 
He expressed the hope that a Palestinian government will be 
formed that can achieve security and justice and pursue the 
successes in the negotiations until the gradual liberation of 
the entire Palestinian land. 
  Dr. Sha'th added that on his short visit to Tunis he briefed 
members of the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary Council and the 
Central Committee of the Fatah Movement on the 
Israeli-Palestinian Agreement.

<F P=106> [Report by Ranya Khallaf: "Lawyers Furor in Central Cairo"] </F>
  [Text] The death in police custody of 32-year-old lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani triggered an angry protest by hundreds of 
lawyers at the Cairo headquarters of the Lawyers Syndicate last 
Tuesday. The police said death had been due to natural causes, 
but members of the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled syndicate 
insisted he had died as a result of torture. Madani was 
arrested on 26 April and transferred to the prisoners' wing of 
Qasr al-'Ayni hospital a few days later, where he subsequently 
died. His family was informed of his death on 6 May and asked 
to collect his body. 
  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi vehemently denied 
allegations 
that Madani's death had been other than a natural one, asserting 
that "the man died of an asthma attack, and it has nothing to do 
with torture." 
  Reported to have been a prominent member of the clandestine 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, Madani was heavily involved in 
defending its members before the courts and had on several 
occasions faced charges himself connected to militant Islamist 
activities. 
  But according to Kamal Khalid, an independent member of 
parliament and lawyer, Madani had recently been trying to 
negotiate truce between the al-Jama'ah and the state. Khalid, 
in an interview with AL-AHRAM WEEKLY, claimed that shortly 
before his arrest Madani had approached him and asked him to 
relate to the security bodies a proposal to end the violence on 
both sides. Khalid added that Madani had told him the 
al-Jama'ah had realised that "certain foreign powers were using 
the confrontation to harm the country, and was therefore willing 
to end its attacks if the security forces did the same." The 
security officials Khalid approached with the proposal refused 
to discuss it however, he went on to allege. 
  Islamist members of the Lawyers Syndicate hailed Madani as a 
martyr and vowed to avenge him. "Martyr have no fear, your 
death shall be avenged," the protesting lawyers chanted at the 
syndicate's headquarters on Tuesday. On the balconies of the 
syndicate's second floor stood veiled women dressed in black 
equally chanting slogans while some wept. 
  Heavily surrounded by contingents of the anti-riot Central 
Security Forces, the syndicate headquarters in central Cairo was 
enveloped in banners, posters and signs denouncing the alleged 
murder of Madani. The lawyers threatened to take their protest 
to the streets, demanding a full investigation into the 
incident. Meanwhile the massive police siege to prevent the 
outbreak of demonstrations created havoc with the already 
congested traffic throughout central Cairo. However, and 
despite the fierceness of the slogans, the police stood and 
watched as the lawyers carried on with their protest within the 
syndicate's gates. 
  Tuesday's angry protest was not confined to the Islamists 
however, but included leftists, Nasirists and a number of 
Wafdists. The head of the Cairo branch of the Lawyers Syndicate, 
leading Wafdist Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz addressed the protest 
rally saying that Madani's death "strengthens our resolve and 
determination to defend freedom and liberties." He went on to 
warn, "It will not be the last unless we take strong and united 
action against such violations." 
  Tuesday's show of unity did not heal the deep fracture in 
the 
ranks of the Islamists themselves however. Muntasir al-Zayyat, 
a prominent lawyer for members of the Jihad and the al-Jama'ah 
told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY after the protest that the Muslim 
Brotherhood members of the Lawyers Syndicate's Executive Council 
were equally to blame for Madani's death. "They should have 
taken more decisive action on this and similar cases," he said, 
adding that some 30 lawyers were still subject to administrative 
detention. Earlier, the Association of Islamist Lawyers, of 
which al-Zayyat is a leading member, issued a statement accusing 
the council of "complicity and cowardice". Commenting on the 
day's events, al-Zayyat criticised the council for failing to 
organise a street demonstration to protest Madani's death. He 
described the recommendations adopted by the council during the 
rally as inadequate. 
  For its part, the council issued a number of resolutions 
demanding that an independent autopsy be conducted on Madani's 
body and that the culprits in his alleged torture be named and 
duly punished. It also demanded the release of all lawyers 
subject to administrative detention. It warned that unless 
these demands are complied with, it will call for a general 
lawyers strike next Sunday and for a peaceful street 
demonstration.

  [Text] Cairo, May 17 (AFP)--Egyptian riot police fired 
tear-gas at thousands of lawyers trying to march on to a 
presidential palace here Tuesday to protest the death of a 
jailed colleague allegedly tortured to death last week. 
  About 6,000 lawyers gathered at the Bar Association's 
headquarters in central Cairo. Riot police intervened with 
tear-gas as the demonstrators neared the gates to start their 
march. 
  The lawyers, who had assured the protest would be peaceful, 
were forced back into the grounds. Most of Egypt's 180,000 
lawyers went on strike Sunday. They are protesting the death of 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani on April 27, a day after he was detained 
for allegedly acting as a go-between for jailed Moslem 
extremists and their contacts abroad. He was a defence lawyer 
for Moslem fundamentalist spiritual leader Shaykh 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman and other members of Islamic groups fighting to 
overthrow the government. 
  Last week, the Prosecutor General's Office issued a 
preliminary report by legal medical experts concluding he had 
been tortured to death. But, the Interior Ministry insisted he 
died of an asthma attack. 
  The Lawyers' Association described Madani's death as 
"premeditated murder," and the Egyptian Organization of Human 
Rights also charged he died of torture.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--The Interior Ministry today 
praised the stand of the majority of lawyers, who issued a 
statement on behalf of the Egyptian Society for Young Lawyers to 
denounce the moves of a minority of self-interested members of 
the Bar Association who claim that they belong to the Islamic 
trend. 
  A responsible security source said the ministry issued a 
statement last Saturday on the arrest of a leading group that 
had assisted terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, including Lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani, a dangerous terrorist who played a major 
role in recent terrorist incidents and who was arrested on 3 
July 1990. He and others were also charged in Case No. 7 of 
1990 in Markaz Isna for attacking citizens and preventing them 
from visiting cemeteries. 
  The source said that the statement also indicated that 
Lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani was also charged in Case No. 4116 of 1991, 
the jurisdiction of Markaz Isna, when he was caught while 
distributing leaflets inciting extremist thought and instigating 
acts of violence. 
  The security source said in his statement that the Interior 
Ministry's statement of last Saturday contained a warning about 
moves by some self-interested people who try in one way or 
another to support terrorism by using some confrontations to 
assume false heroic poses. 
  He added that in its statement the Ministry stressed its 
intention to confront these elements firmly and decisively 
should they contemplate any attempts to violate legitimacy and 
the law under this cover while only aiming to create confusion 
among the people. 
  The source added that this morning some elements known for 
their activities in connection with these groups and some 
members of the dissolved and banned Muslim Brotherhood incited 
some lawyers and misled members of the Bar Association to 
assemble at the Bar Association headquarters. There they urged 
the lawyers to stage a mass demonstration to rouse the public, 
incite them to violate the law, and subject the public to the 
danger of infiltration by elements who pursue only sedition and 
deception. 
  Responsible Interior Ministry security sources said the 
security forces have emphatically advised these groups 
repeatedly not to stage any demonstrations from the Bar 
Association headquarters out of concern for the citizens' lives 
and security. But, he added, it was evident that there was a 
purposeful intention by this renegade minority to carry out 
sedition and incitement. 
  He said this intention was manifested when those who 
gathered 
inside the Bar Association building threw bricks and stones down 
onto the police and passers by and then rushed into the street 
in a vociferous demonstration chanting hostile slogans. 
  The source added that the security forces deployed in the 
area intervened immediately to break up the demonstration and 
arrested 39 of the leaders. It transpired that there were 27 
lawyers among them; the rest were not members of the Bar 
Association. 
  He said that lawyer Mursi Muhammad 'Abd-al-Qadir and 
(?teacher) Khalid 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ibrahim al-Jiddawi suffered 
slight injuries for which they were hospitalized but no damage 
was caused in the area because the security forces took control 
of the situation. 
  The Interior Ministry responsible security source revealed 
that the Ministry authorities had received information that some 
extremist members of the Bar Association had called on their 
colleagues to carry arms to confront the security forces. 
  He said the Ministry authorities at dawn today compiled a 
report on this information, numbered 2293-Qasr al-Nil, and sent 
it to the competent prosecution office. 
  The security source said that the Interior Ministry has been 
patient with all the incitement incidents since the death of 
terrorist 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, despite the extremely sensitive 
security circumstances at this time. 
  He explained that the Ministry did this to show the 
inevitability of democracy, which has been emphasized by the 
political leadership; but the attempts by a hireling minority of 
Bar Association members prompted the security forces to 
decisively confront this morning's attempts to endanger the 
Egyptian public's lives and property. 
  The Interior Ministry will issue a comprehensive statement 
containing updated information and details on the issue at a 
later time.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Isam-al-Din: "IMF Reforms Under Attack"] </F>
  [Text] The government got a fresh vote of confidence from 
the People's Assembly in the early hours of Tuesday after Prime 
Minister 'Atif Sidqi defended its economic performance against a 
verbal onslaught by two left-wing deputies who lashed out at its 
International Monetary Fund inspired economic reform policy. 
  The verbal lashing came from al-Badri Farghali, the Port 
Said 
representative of the leftwing National Progressive Unionist 
Grouping, and Ahmad Taha, an independent with leftist leanings 
from Cairo's al-Sahil district. Both charged that widespread 
poverty and greater social instability were the inevitable 
results of economic reform measures imposed on the government by 
the IMF and the World Bank. 
  Sidqi denounced Farghali's speech as "hollow and outdated 
slogans" and said it must have been written for him by "people 
whom time had left behind". Sidqi said the IMF and World Bank 
never dictate policies, asserting that the economic reform laws 
were not the product of their instructions but rather a 
reflection of the need to generate high rates of growth. 
  To prove his point, he cited statistics that the budget 
deficit fell from 30 per cent in the pre-reform period to 2.6 
per cent at present. Inflation rates, he added, fell from 25 
per cent to 7.3 per cent at present, while the balance of 
payments secured a surplus for the first time in 1991 amounting 
to US$5.6 billion. This surplus dropped, however, to $2 billion 
in 1993/94 as a result of the slump in tourism. 
  Sidqi argued that the sale of public assets is a means of 
attracting more investments and attributed the financial losses 
suffered by public sector companies to "old and shameful" 
economic policies. These companies are under financial 
restructuring at present. 
  Stressing that the government is mindful of the social 
dimensions of economic reform, Sidqi said it devotes special 
attention to the deprived sectors of society. As a result, 
budgetary allocations for education rose from LE [Egyptian 
pound] 674 million in 1981 to LE9.4 billion this year, health 
allocations from 267 million in 1981 to 3.5 billion, and subsidy 
allocations from LE1.6 billion in 1981 to LE4 billion. 
  Farghali had charged that economic reform measures gave the 
IMF and World Bank the upper hand in tightening their control 
over the destinies of Egyptians. He said agreements concluded 
with them contributed to the disintegration of Egyptian society 
and undermined its long-time cohesion. 
  Farghali showed the House a document purporting to be an 
agreement with the World Bank to raise local energy prices to 
world levels by 1995. Displaying a letter from the World Bank 
to under-secretaries at the International Cooperation Ministry 
and the Social Insurance Organisation asking them to abide by 
the time-schedule of economic reform, Farghali charged the IMF 
and World Bank gave themselves the right to interfere in the 
performance of government under-secretaries. He also produced a 
letter from the World Bank to Deputy Prime Minister Kamal 
al-Janzuri listing 65 economic reform measures that the 
government has to take before July 1995. These include laws on 
foreign exchange, a new sales tax, a unified tax, a reduction in 
tariff levels, more investment incentives and the liberalisation 
of housing rents. 
  Farghali said that among the negative social consequences of 
economic reform was the escalation of terrorism. "Roses never 
grow in swamps and swamps never produce roses," said Farghali, 
asking Sidqi to tell him how many terrorists were employed. 
  Sidqi admitted that most of the documents produced by 
Farghali were authentic but denied that they wee deliberately 
kept secret by the government. "The contents of such documents 
were freely debated on more than one occasion. May our hands be 
cut off if they sign anything that is contrary to the interests 
of Egypt or its people," Sidqi said. He stressed that at no 
time was economic reform dictated by the IMF and World Bank. 
  For his part, Ahmad Taha described the agreements with the 
IMF and the World Bank as "colonial intervention and a cultural 
setback" which breed "parasitic, capitalist forces that plunder 
Egypt and diffuse corruption". He said the Egyptian economy was 
falling prey to those Mafia-like parasitic forces and urged the 
government to rebel against the IMF and World Bank, liquidate 
the ill-effects of their dictated policies and develop a 
self-reliant approach. Taha said that Egypt has such great 
resources that "we can grow to become not only tigers but also 
Pharaohs". 
  In his speech, Sidqi denied that the government violated the 
constitution in introducing economic reforms. The constitution 
is not static, he said, and "we cannot live without making 
changes".

  [Text] This evening, Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi chaired 
a Ministerial Economic Group meeting to review the 
implementation of the economic reform program's second phase and 
to discuss future cooperation between Egypt, the IMF, and the 
World Bank. 
  In a press statement released today, the prime minister said 
that Egypt has achieved distinct success in implementing 
economic reform programs. This, he added, was evident in the 
Egyptian pounds' steady exchange rates against foreign 
currencies, especially the dollar. He said the Egyptian Central 
Bank had a $16 billion surplus and this recently increased by 
$400 million. 
  Sidqi said the government is in the process of devising a 
new 
workers' law to be submitted to the People's Assembly during its 
current session.

  [Text] Khartoum, May 18, IRNA -- The Sudani deputy foreign 
minister, 'Umar Yusif Baridu, Tuesday called for strengthening 
of ties with Iran and said Khartoum is proud of having relations 
with Tehran. In a meeting with Iranian ambassador to Khartoum 
Majid Kamal, Baridu voiced his country's readiness to promote 
bilateral ties with Iran. He termed his recent trip to Iran and 
his negotiations with Iranian officials as fruitful. 
  Meanwhile, the Sudanese official expressed regret over 
fierce 
fighting in Yemen and Afghanistan. Referring to the 
conspiracies masterminded by the world arrogance against 
Muslims, Baridu urged for an end to the ongoing genocide of 
Muslims and called for the settlement of their disputes through 
peaceful means. At the end of the meeting he welcomed the 
imminent trip of his Iranian counterpart 'Abbas Maleki to Sudan.

  [Text] The Juba political conference of peace forces 
convened today in the town of Juba and comes as a confirmation 
and reassurance of the peace process and territorial integrity 
within the federal system. The conference also confirms that 
the Sudanese people share a common destiny, reject violence and 
fighting, and that the rebel movement still has the chance to 
return to the mainstream of the homeland so that all the sons of 
the homeland could embark on development and social and economic 
reconstruction.

  [Excerpt] Juba, 15 May (SUNA) -- The convention of Juba 
peace gathering affirms the southerners' extreme desire for 
peace, said Vice President Major General George Kongor. 
  Addressing the opening session of the gathering, Kongor said 
that the gathering is a message unanimously reached by the 
internal front to condemn the acts of those who back the 
continuation of the war in the south. The revolution, he said, 
is keen to achieve the Sudanese peoples' full desire for a 
comprehensive peace and stability in southern Sudan. All the 
Sudanese people reject the continuation of the 14-year war, he 
added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Juba political conference ended in the Bahr 
al-Jabal provincial capital today. It issued its resolutions 
and recommendations and the Juba declaration document. 
  The closing session was addressed by Angelo Beda, deputy 
speaker of the Transitional National Assembly and chairman of 
the conference steering committee, who said that the Juba 
conference constitutes a confirmation of national unity, a call 
to end the conflict, a prop for ongoing peace efforts, and an 
amplification of the voice of the silent majority of the sons of 
the south. He stressed that the conference was a means of 
strengthening federal rule, the policy adopted by the national 
salvation resolution to rebuild the country. Mr. Beda said the 
blend of cultures and different dialects emerging during the 
conference confirmed the keenness of the sons of the country to 
strengthen national unity. 
  Mr. Beda then read out the conference resolutions and 
recommendations, which broadly call for adherence to national 
unity and rejection of foreign interference aimed at weakening 
the country. The resolutions and recommendations condemned the 
desperate attempts by some southern factions to introduce 
proposals inconsistent with the views of the majority. The 
recommendations also stressed the need to establish just, 
permanent, and comprehensive peace; to speed up the end of the 
war; to adhere to the principles laid down by the national 
salvation revolution; to accept the federal system as a safe 
means of achieving national unity and to ensure effective 
participation in the process to ensure its success; and to 
establish a general authority to follow up the proceedings of 
the conference by steering the peace movement from within. 
  Afterwards, Professor 'Abd-al-Rahman Abu Zayd, rapporteur of 
the conference steering committee, presented the Juba 
declaration document, which appeals to those bearing arms to 
respond to the voice of reason, to stop the fighting, to return 
to the mainstream of the nation, to participate in the 
reconstruction of a respected and honored Sudan, to restore 
development and stability in the south, and to support ongoing 
efforts to establish peace from within.

  [Text] In Oslo today, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said that 
he is committed to the Document of Principles [DOP] signed with 
Israel, and that he opposes violence and terror. He further 
claimed that his remarks were taken out of context, saying that 
when speaking about jihad, he meant a religious, nonviolent 
struggle and that his remarks were misconstrued in Israel. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz was told that upon 
his 
arrival in Oslo, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres announced that 
he would boycott all the events he was scheduled to attend with 
'Arafat until the PLO head personally announced his commitment 
to the DOP and declared his opposition to violence and terror, 
and declared his support for peace. 
  It has just been reported that Minister Peres indeed 
boycotted a luncheon with former U.S. President Carter and PLO 
Chairman 'Arafat. Before holding the joint news conference in 
which 'Arafat made the above announcement, Peres consulted Prime 
Minister Rabin regarding the steps he should take during his 
stopover in Stockholm. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] PLO leader 'Arafat appealed for a holy war to free 
Jerusalem and this was broadcast on the Israeli Radio and, of 
course, created a great stir. At his press conference in Oslo 
today, 'Arafat said that the holy war, jihad, is a religious 
term and that with this word he meant a peaceful campaign. 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English] What I had mentioned 
exactly, a religious terminology. Jihad, for your information, 
I will continue my jihad to achieve peace. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent Johan Fredriksson] Well, PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat is of the opinion that he has been misinterpreted. The 
Israeli Radio had obtained a tape from a meeting in South Africa 
two weeks ago. Israeli Radio broadcast this tape and it created 
concern in peace efforts. Yasir 'Arafat used the Arabic word 
jihad, a holy war, but the statement was just part of religious 
terminology and what 'Arafat meant was a sort of peaceful 
crusade for the Palestinian cause, he said. And thus he and the 
Norwegian mediators were of the opinion that the new threat 
against the ongoing peace process was alleviated. 
  As a confirmation of this, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres appeared quite unexpectedly at the news conference in Oslo 
and then even 'Arafat was surprised. Shim'on Peres said he was 
satisfied that Yasir 'Arafat has confirmed his and his 
organization's commitment to the peace process in the Middle 
East. This is Johan Fredriksson, Oslo.

  [Excerpt] Oslo, May 18 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
said here Wednesday [18 May] that his recent call for a Moslem 
holy war should not be construed as hostile to Israel but rather 
an appeal to strive for complete Middle East peace. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who had said he 
would 
query 'Arafat on the remark, walked into an 'Arafat press 
conference as the PLO leader was giving his explanation. The 
two men shook hands and Peres took a seat at 'Arafat's side. 
  They were here for ceremonies honoring Norway's role in 
brokering the Israeli-PLO peace agreement. 
  Controversy flared Tuesday when Israeli Radio broadcast what 
it said was a speech given by 'Arafat May 10 in a Johannesburg 
mosque in which the Palestinian leader called on Moslems to 
"take part in a jihad (holy war) to liberate Jerusalem." 
'Arafat was in South Africa for Nelson Mandela's inauguration 
as president. 
  'Arafat said here Wednesday that his comments had been 
misunderstood. 
  Speaking in English, he said, "it seems that they are trying 
to squeeze me with false means." 
  He said that after praying at the Johannesburg mosque, "the 
worshippers asked me to make a religious speech" and he insisted 
that his use of "jihad" was a religious phraseology. 
  "For your information," he told reporters, "we can say, `I 
will continue my jihad to achieve peace' in an Islamic, in a 
religious way. We can say `I will continue my jihad to do my 
work well, til I will be able to bring Christians, Moslems and 
Jews to play together in Jerusalem.'" 
  He insisted: "Some extremists have changed the religious 
terminology into a political terminology. It is not my fault." 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had warned earlier 
Tuesday in Israel that if 'Arafat's remarks were confirmed, it 
"calls into question the peace process." 
  Rabin warned at a press conference with visiting U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Israel would "not 
accept such violations and continue the process." Christopher 
said he endorsed Rabin's statement. 
  Wednesday's official agenda said 'Arafat and Peres would 
take 
part in the inauguration of a sculpture offered to the Norwegian 
people for their contribution to the Middle East peace process.

<F P=106> [Report by Orli Azulay-Katz in Oslo] </F>
  [Excerpt] "I will be moving to Jericho next month, and the 
PLO headquarters will be moving along with me," Yasir 'Arafat 
stated last night in an interview with YEDI'OT AHARONOT. 
  He added: "I have not yet set the exact date, but my goal is 
to move next month. In the initial stage, not all but only part 
of the headquarters will move, but all of the leadership will be 
arriving in Jericho with me." 
  Question: "Do you think the crisis in the wake of your 
remarks in Johannesburg has been settled?" 
  'Arafat: "There is no crisis whatsoever; everything is clear 
now. I spoke in the mosque about `jihad,' which is a religious 
term. I did not talk about violence. One meaning of the word 
`jihad' is prayer, not war. I am against violence, and I am in 
favor of all of us doing everything we can to pursue the peace." 
  'Arafat was in a good mood last night, basking in the 
flattery and praise of his speech at the Norwegian Peace 
Institute in Oslo. 
  "It was very important to me to make people understand what 
I 
meant," 'Arafat said. "I did not see anything wrong with it. 
People who know me know that I was not referring to violence. 
How could they even conceive of such a thing?!" 
  At this point, 'Arafat's bodyguards cut off the interview 
and 
told me to leave, saying that "the chairman also needs to rest 
for five minutes." 
  Marwan Kanafani, 'Arafat's aide, told YEDI'OT AHARONOT last 
night: "The media is to blame for everything. It took a 
problem of semantics and turned it into a crisis. Whoever wrote 
such things did not understand their meaning. President 'Arafat 
was addressing an Iranian audience in the mosque in 
Johannesburg, and he did not speak about violence. Furthermore, 
this is not the first time that he talks about the issue of 
Jerusalem. He always speaks about Jerusalem, not just to the 
Arabs but to members of all faiths. 
  "I absolutely do not understand why such a fuss is being 
made 
over one word. Imagine us creating a crisis because you insist 
on calling 'Arafat the chairman, while we insist that he is the 
president. Those who want peace should not do such things, 
because it creates a bad feeling." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Oslo correspondent Yo'av Tocker] </F>
  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will hold a tete-a-tete 
meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo this 
evening. 'Arafat said he is committed to the Declaration of 
Principles [DOP] signed with Israel and opposes violence and 
terrorism. The PLO chairman admitted that he had called on 
Muslims to launch a jihad for the liberation of Jerusalem but 
noted that he had been referring to a peaceful struggle. 
'Arafat alleged that his remarks had been misconstrued. Our 
correspondent Yo'av Tocker reports on the meeting between 
'Arafat and Peres in Oslo: 
  [Begin recording] [Tocker] In this video footage we can see 
the exposed tip of the nervous, political-psychological iceberg 
that was evident here over the past few hours. Mr. Peres 
arrives at a ceremony held by the Carter Foundation for Human 
Rights. He approaches the audience and pointedly avoids Yasir 
'Arafat, on his right, who, with a knowing smile, is about to 
take his seat. Several moments earlier, following Peres' demand, 
and in the wake of U.S. mediation efforts, 'Arafat explained 
that his call for a jihad was really a call for peace. 
  ['Arafat, in English] I will continue my jihad to achieve 
peace. We can say it in an Islamic, religious way. I will 
continue my jihad to do my work very well. I will continue my 
jihad until I will be able to.... [pauses] Christians and 
Muslims to pray together; and Jews to pray together in 
Jerusalem. This is a Terra Santa for Jews, for Christians, for 
Muslims. 
  [Tocker] 'Arafat's clarifications, issued with a great deal 
of embarrassment, were prompted by Peres' ultimatum that 'Arafat 
must publicly state his commitment to the peace process, which 
the PLO chairman indeed did, thus apparently satisfying the 
foreign minister. Nevertheless, when I asked him on behalf of 
Israel Television what he meant by jihad, 'Arafat refused to 
clarify his remarks directly to the Israeli people. 
  [Peres] This is the minimum I expected him to say. 
  [Tocker] What do you mean by the minimum? 
  [Peres] In other words, this is what was necessary. The 
situation was not a simple one, but had he not issued this 
statement I would not have come. 
  [Tocker] What do you intend to discuss in your meeting with 
'Arafat later this evening? Will you demand that he express 
even more detailed reservations? 
  [Peres] He has already expressed whatever reservations were 
necessary. He made a mistake and subsequently tried to rectify 
it. However, I hope that all of us, and especially 'Arafat, will 
honor the DOP. 
  [Tocker] Beyond what you describe as the minimum, do you 
accept this interpretation of jihad as semantics, a religious 
term bereft of any political or military significance? 
  [Peres] I am not a philologist. I insisted on three other 
things: his total commitment to the DOP, the total negation of 
terrorism and violence, and that future developments must be 
achieved entirely through negotiations. 
  [Tocker] I noticed that you refrained from talking to 
'Arafat or shaking his hand during the ceremony, even after his 
public clarification. 
  [Peres] That was not especially called for. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F>
Oslo, by Hayim Zissowitz in Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning to Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Zissowitz] We are speaking with you in Oslo following your 
meeting last night with Yasir 'Arafat. Let us first talk about 
his explanations, which the prime minister termed far-fetched. 
Is that how you would describe them? 
  [Peres] Professor Hayim Weizmann used to say that silence is 
golden. In other words, there is no doubt whatsoever that this 
utterance was unnecessary, damaging, and infuriating, but words 
are hard to take back; one can only explain them and apologize, 
which is what Mr. Yasir 'Arafat did. Before entering the news 
conference, the main point on which I insisted was that he 
reiterate the following three commitments: that he remains 
faithful and loyal to the Declaration of Principles and has not 
deviated from it, that he calls for an end to the use of any 
form of violence and terror, and that all disputed issues in the 
future will be settled through political rather than any other 
means. 
  He said all that, and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
witnessed it. Of course, I cannot tell you that I am pleased 
about the whole business. Indeed, as the prime minister said, 
it was a mishap -- and a regrettable one at that. In our 
meeting, 'Arafat explained to me that he had been arguing with 
the Iranians and telling them: You talk about jihad. So, what 
have you done with this jihad? I believe he has learned his 
lesson with regard to the future. 
  [Zissowitz] The recurring impression is that Yasir 'Arafat 
says certain things when he signs agreements, meets with 
Israelis, and shakes their hands, and totally different things 
in closed rooms. 
  [Peres] There is yet another test. To the best of our 
knowledge, neither Yasir 'Arafat nor the PLO leadership have 
lent their hand to the resumption of terror since the Oslo 
agreement 10 months ago -- and this is also a fact. Of course, 
the verbal mishap remains, but as far as we know, in the field 
they have remained faithful to their commitment. 
  [Zissowitz] Nevertheless, they have not canceled the clauses 
in the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's annihilation. 
  [Peres] Confusion persists on this issue. They canceled 
them. The PLO leadership officially announced that the 
Palestinian Covenant is not in effect for all practical 
purposes; they used the word inoperative [last word in English]. 
Furthermore, 'Arafat said they will cancel them when the PNC 
[Palestine National Council] -- which has the constitutional 
right to do so with a two-thirds majority -- convenes, but at 
the moment they are unable to summon the PNC. In our meeting in 
Cairo, he reiterated his commitment to cancel them when the PNC 
holds its first session in Gaza. Hence, we cannot say that they 
have not abided by their commitment. I believe they have a real 
problem to convene the PNC and to muster a two-thirds majority, 
because there is no doubt that both the Arab world and the 
Palestinian world are very divided. What is exceptional about 
the PLO's position is not that they succeeded in mobilizing the 
entire Palestinian world but that this is the first time the 
Palestinians have renounced the path of violence, the path of 
the mufti of Jerusalem, and turned to a path of compromise and 
dialogue. 
  [Zissowitz] We occasionally get the impression that we rush 
to forgive 'Arafat and forget what he says and what he does not 
say, such as when he refrained from denouncing the terror 
attacks in 'Afula and Hadera. 
  [Peres] My dear friend, only God forgives; people can just 
pass judgment and remember. We do not forgive anything, and we 
remain watchful in all spheres -- both the declarative and the 
factual ones -- as well as with regard to his efforts to repair 
the damage when there is a deviation, as in the current mishap 
and his efforts to amend it. Indeed, he went out of his way to 
amend it. Having said that, I do not want to justify anything. 
Still, we take note of all these events, and we know the 
precise nature of the partner with whom we signed an agreement. 
I repeat: In practice, they have not deviated from what was 
agreed. 
  [Zissowitz] Now that you mention terror, there was an 
attack yesterday near Netzarim. The terrorists fled into 
al-Shaja'iyah and the Palestinian policemen certainly did not 
pursue them. This creates an entirely new situation in the 
field in everything pertaining to fighting terror. 
  [Peres] Look, the Palestinian police is also being tested, 
and it knows it. It realizes that if the police force proves 
ineffective, nobody will support it. In other words, the 
Palestinian police needs outside financial support and must 
build its credibility in order to continue the negotiations. 
Numerous major tests lie ahead of it, and I have reason to 
believe that it will really make a supreme effort. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you also have reason to believe that the 
Palestinian policemen will join the efforts to thwart terror and 
arrest those who perpetrate it? 
  [Peres] I have no doubt about it. They do not have to do it 
for us, but for themselves. 
  [Zissowitz] Sir, 'Arafat also talked about the discussion of 
the fate of Jerusalem in the permanent arrangements. 
  [Peres] No, he did not talk about what we agreed. You know, 
the whole business of a letter is a fiction. 
  [Zissowitz] Did you ask him why he said he had a letter and 
on what basis he made such allegations about you? 
  [Peres] I think.... [pauses] Why should I explain 
anything? I only know that there is no such letter and that 
this was an unfounded allegation. As for Jerusalem, there is an 
agreement which says that it is not included in the Gaza-Jericho 
accord and that it is not part of the autonomy area. When we 
proceed to discuss the permanent arrangement, they may raise the 
issue for the agenda, just as they may raise any other issue. 
If you remember, the late Menahem Begin also said that the 
Palestinians may raise any issue. Our agreement, however, says 
that the question of Jerusalem is not connected to Gaza and 
Jericho and is outside the timetable pertaining to the autonomy. 
As for the permanent solution, they may raise whatever issue 
they want. 
  [Zissowitz] In the debate about the permanent arrangement in 
Jerusalem, will Israel be prepared to show some flexibility? 
  [Peres] No, my position on the question of Jerusalem is 
clear and totally inflexible. I say that Jerusalem is closed 
from the political point of view and open from the religious 
one. In other words, from the political point of view, there 
will be no compromises and Jerusalem will remain Israel's united 
capital. We will not turn Jerusalem into Berlin; there is no 
way we are going to build or allow others to build walls in it. 
From the religious point of view, the Israeli Government proved 
to be the only government to have given worshipers of all faiths 
free access to pray in the city without any intervention. I 
believe one of the greatest achievements -- historically, not 
just diplomatically -- is the fact that the Vatican signed an 
agreement with us on mutual recognition with the status of 
Jerusalem being what it is: a united Jerusalem. You know, this 
is the kind of event that happens once in 2,000 years. We would 
like to reach a similar agreement with the Muslim world. From 
the religious aspect, everything is open; from the political 
one, everything is closed. 
  [Zissowitz] I would like to ask you a question on an 
entirely different issue. The State Comptroller's Office annual 
report issued yesterday shows that governments come and go but 
things remain the same and corruption is rampant. 
  [Peres] What corruption are you talking about? 
  [Zissowitz] You may not have heard all the details of the 
report, but the State Comptroller's Office uncovered corruption 
in all government ministries. 
  [Peres] It is not a matter of rampant corruption but of 
human weaknesses. A person with wings, like an angel, has not 
yet been created. In my opinion, a government should not be 
judged by whether its members make mistakes or are corrupt but 
by whether it fights corruption and mistakes. I believe this 
government is determined to fight any occurrence of corruption, 
nepotism, mistakes, and errors. 
  [Zissowitz] Mr. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, I thank you 
very much.

  [Text] In their meeting last night in Oslo, Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 'Arafat agreed on 
principles and an agenda to begin negotiations on widening the 
authority of Palestinian self-rule to other areas of Judaea and 
Samaria, aside from Jericho. The negotiations are to take place 
in Cairo, but no date was set. Peres told reporters the 
withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza Strip has been completed 
properly.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F>
Oslo, by Mikhal Gazit and Ya'aqov Eylon in the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Eylon] Mr. Peres, with 
regard to the question of Syria, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's latest trip received a frosty reaction in 
Damascus. Do you share this impression? Is the issue stuck or 
do you see some progress? 
  [Peres] Look, we know how things work in Damascus. Until 
they give their agreement, frosty winds blow in all directions. 
People used to say that the difference between Syria and 
Lebanon is that with Lebanon it is very easy to reach an 
agreement but the agreement will be totally worthless, while 
with the Syrians it is very hard to reach an agreement but the 
agreement will stand. We will continue to act and strive until 
we convince the entire Middle East of the need for peace. In 
other words, we are the initiating party; we are not being 
dragged after anybody and we are not the offended party; we do 
not play sulking games. We have a very clear policy, and we 
must continue to act to implement it. 
  [Gazit] Mr. Peres, a banner headline in today's press says 
that Israel agrees to the establishment of a Syrian 
early-warning station in the Galilee. Do you have any idea what 
this is about? 
  [Peres] In my opinion, all these are premature speculations. 
I do not think we can discuss such details yet, because the 
problems between us and Syria are not of a technical nature but 
are a matter of principle. Only after we reach an agreement in 
principle will there be room to discuss technical issues. 
  [Gazit] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, thank you very much.

  [Text] Political sources in Jerusalem have said that in 
evaluating the proposals relayed by Syria to Israel through U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, one can deduce that 
Damascus is ready to discuss the time factor for a settlement on 
the Golan provided Israel announces its agreement to withdraw 
completely from the Golan. Our political affairs correspondent 
Shlomo Ganor has learned that Syria proposed that the withdrawal 
be carried out within a period not to exceed four years on 
condition that it includes security arrangements on both sides 
of the border.

today that the police has no intention of clashing with the 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] military arm, 'Izz-al-Din

whether the Palestinian police would prevent acts of terror by 
Hamas. Nasr Yusuf added that he had reached full understanding 
with the leaders of Hamas whom he met over the past several

<F P=106> [Report by Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari] </F>
  [Text] As Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip 
continues, here is some food for thought. The IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] completed its pullout one week earlier than 
originally agreed upon in Cairo. This of course was carried out 
with the agreement of the PLO and the subsequent result is that 
only one third of the Palestinian forces slated to enter the 
area have indeed assumed their stations and the Palestinian 
Authority has yet to be established. 
  Second, the first impression made by the Fatah units 
entering 
the Gaza Strip was better than many Israelis had initially 
feared. Now, however, things are not looking so good. Looting 
has become quite widespread in the Gaza Strip and many telephone 
cables, air conditioners, and other objects have been stolen. 
The Fatah army has no money. It cannot afford to purchase gas 
for its vehicles or even food for the troops. In several 
places, complaints have been received that soldiers are eating 
at restaurants without paying. The majority of the troops have 
not received sufficient training in police work. 
  Third, if money does not arrive quickly from foreign 
sources, 
Israel may have to supply the Palestinians with urgent financial 
aid in order to pay for immediate expenditures. This sum could 
reach several million shekels. 
  Fourth, there is a great deal of tension among Fatah 
operatives in the Gaza Strip who fear that they are being pushed 
aside by 'Arafat's veteran officers. The open tension between 
the Fatah activists and the police commanders occasionally 
precludes cooperation. 
  On the political level, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
has adopted a wait and see approach, while forbidding prisoners 
to sign any declarations of support for the peace process. 
  Meanwhile, Fatah has failed to drum up support for an 
agreement on the establishment of new municipal councils in 
Nabulus and Hebron. These are all labor pains, of course. 
'Arafat wants to differentiate between the Israeli withdrawal 
and the establishment of his authority. However, seeing as at 
the present time, there is no real authority in the Gaza Strip 
to replace Israel's partial control, difficulties can be 
expected even in the event of a best-case scenario.

  [Text] Tunis, 18 May (MENA)--Al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, 
Palestinian ambassador in Jordan and member of Fatah's Central 
Committee, stated that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will complete 
the formation of the Palestinian National Authority's council 
following the 'Id al-Adha holidays [21-24 May]. 
  In exclusive remarks to MENA correspondent in Tunis, 
'Abd-al-Rahim noted that the council will hold its first meeting 
in Cairo following the 'Id al-Adha to distribute the portfolios 
and responsibilities among its members. After that, all the 
council members will return to the homeland following the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho. 
'Abd-al-Rahim said that during its meeting in Tunis last night 
the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary Council decided to form 
several committees to work out a plan for the Fatah cadres to 
return to the homeland with specific assignments and 
instructions. Under this plan, each cadre could work in his 
area of specialization within the National Authority's 
institutions. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim added that the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary 
Council stressed the need for the movement to actively and 
effectively participate in the Palestinian National Authority to 
strengthen the Palestinian newborn authority. The Revolutionary 
Council, he added, backed the Central Committee's decision on 
the need for Fatah's effective participation in the National 
Authority's council and institutions in a way that reflects the 
movement's magnitude and role in the Palestinian struggle and to 
guarantee success for these institutions. 'Abd-al-Rahim added 
that this will ensure that the beginning in Gaza and Jericho 
will be the first step toward the liberation of the homeland and 
the restoration of the Palestinian people's national rights. He 
noted that the Revolutionary Council also made a decision 
securing the return of most of the movement's cadres to Gaza and 
Jericho so they could assume their responsibility and 
consolidate the newborn authority, which is the fruit of many 
long years of struggle by Fatah. 
  Concerning the reasons for the delay in signing the 
executive 
program of the Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement, 
'Abd-al-Rahim said it was due to two points related to banking 
coordination and supervision in the self-rule area. He pointed 
out that in light of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the 
gains made by the Palestinians under the agreement, sound 
operational mechanisms had to be found to put the 
Palestinian-Jordanian agreement into effect and establish 
excellent ties between the two sides as well as between the 
Palestinians and other Arab countries.

  [Text] An official spokesman for the Central Committee of 
the Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah [dissident], 
has asserted that statements made by 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Majayizah, member of the so-called committee negotiating 
Palestinian security and one of 'Arafat's supporters, on 
disarming our people's masses expose the mission and role of the 
self-rule police. 
  He said that 'Arafat's police are doing what the Zionist 
enemy has failed to do over the past years to harm our people's 
steadfastness and resistance. The spokesman urged the sons of 
our people and their active forces to be vigilant toward such 
statements and their dimensions.

  [Excerpt] The revolutionary council of the Palestinian 
National Liberation Movement, Fatah, held its 12th ordinary 
session in Tunis. It was the martyr-leader Abu al-Mundhir and 
the Khalil al-Rahman martyrs' session held in the period between 
16 and 17 May. The council heard the report of the central 
committee, read out by brother Abu al-Lutf, as well as the 
reports of the committees related to various activities. 
  Brother President Yasir 'Arafat spoke in detail about what 
happened from Madrid to Cairo, and what has been realized, the 
entry of the Palestinian security forces to the homeland and the 
popular welcome accorded to these forces, as well as about the 
need for the solidarity of all to care for the newly-born 
Palestinian Authority which needs the arms of all cadres and 
leaderships. 'Arafat spoke also about the importance of the 
historic step achieved as a result of the sacrifice of thousands 
of martyrs, injured, prisoners, and detainees. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] "It was an ordinary business meeting," Hanan 
'Ashrawi stated at the end of a one-hour meeting U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher held yesterday at the U.S. Consulate 
in East Jerusalem with a group of Palestinian figures that 
included Faysal al-Husayni and Hebron Mayor 'Abd-al-Nabi 
al-Natshah. 
  "We touched upon all possible issues," said al-Husayni upon 
emerging from the meeting, in which he asked Christopher to 
intercede with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to lift the closure 
on Jerusalem. "The occupied territories and Jerusalem are one," 
he said, "and it is inconceivable that the Israelis are creating 
an unnatural division." Al-Husayni emphasized that there is no 
difference between the Arabs of Jerusalem and those living in 
the West Bank. According to him, the closure splits up 
families, affects their economic situation, and denies them the 
right to worship in Muslim holy places. [passage omitted] 
  Due to the brief nature of the session, the participants had 
no time to discuss the continuation of the process or special 
aid requests. "The meeting was meant to present urgent 
problems," 'Ashrawi said. Christopher promised to raise the 
problems with Rabin in their next meeting. "The difficulties 
will disappear as time goes by, and when everything starts 
working out, the Israelis will be more flexible," he said. 
  The Palestinians emerged disappointed from the meeting. 
Other than promising to raise the problems they presented with 
Rabin, Christopher did not commit himself to anything. 
Palestinian sources said that Christopher knows he cannot 
conclude anything with the people with whom he met even if he 
wanted to. "The Americans are in Rabin's pocket," one 
Palestinian said. "Now that he has given back Jericho and Gaza, 
he cannot be pressured; the U.S. secretary of state knows it, 
and we know it." 
  'Ashrawi also noted that as far as the Palestinians are 
concerned, it would have been better to negotiate directly with 
Israel, but that constraints in the field preclude it. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- The Islamic Jihad Movement 
of Palestine on Tuesday [17 May] accused the REUTERS of 
distorting the remarks made by the secretary-general of the 
movement Fathi Shaqaqi in an interview with the daily AL-QUDS. 
  REUTERS quoting Shaqaqi had earlier reported that the 
Islamic 
Jihad Movement was considering a new strategy to prove that it 
was a political movement, and that it was ready to cooperate 
with the Palestinian police to enforce the Gaza-Jericho deal. 
  The movement in a statement published Tuesday, reiterated 
its 
commitment to its strategy of confronting the Zionist regime, 
and said "this policy is definite and unalterable." 
  It said that struggle is a legal, historical and religious 
right for the Palestinian people that can by no means be 
ignored. The movement would encounter the Zionist aggressors 
any time and anywhere, it stressed. 
  Fathi Shaqaqi had told the daily that "the movement would do 
its best to avoid clashes with Palestinian police in Gaza and 
Jericho even though this might make us change some of our 
tactics." 
  Shaqaqi had continued by saying that the principled stance 
of 
the movement was based on rejecting and disgracing the 
Gaza-Jericho compromise deal, and opposing any measure which 
would likely legitimize the occupation of each and every part of 
Palestine.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Hamas Demands Its Founder's </F>
Release"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) 
has demanded the "immediate" release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the 
movement's leader, who has been in the occupation's jails for 
five years. It renewed its rejection of the "undertaking 
statement" which the occupation forces want the detainees to 
sign before they can be released from detention centers. 
  A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's 
Damascus bureau has received, says: "We demand the immediate 
release of Shaykh Yasin and his detained brothers. We condemn 
discrimination between detainees on the basis of their political 
and ideological positions. Yasin has rejected all the enemies' 
bargaining over his release. He has also turned down the offers 
made by (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin and (Foreign 
Minister Shim'on) Peres to release him immediately in return for 
supporting the so-called peace agreement." 
  The movement warned of "the deterioration of Yasin's health. 
We condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment 
and undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's 
persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise 
Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government 
responsible for anything that may happen to him." 
  The movement renewed its absolute rejection of "the 
humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy 
authorities" say must be signed. The movement said that "while 
Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his 
brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that 
their detention will lead only to further escalation and 
resistance against the occupation. All sincere people and 
mujahidin will continue their efforts to secure the release of 
Shaykh Yasin and his heroic brothers." 
  Meanwhile, a statement issued by the "Palestinian Forces 
Alliance" opposed to the Oslo accord has urged governments of 
the Arab and Islamic states and international organizations to 
work to secure Yasin's release. It said: "It is meaningless to 
release some detainees and continue to hold others. Human 
rights are indivisible." 
  Abu-Hamad Mustafa, Hamas' representative in Damascus, told 
AL-HAYAH that the alliance yesterday staged a sit-in outside the 
International Red Cross offices. Alliance representatives 
demanded Yasin's release. Hamas' representative added that the 
representatives submitted a memorandum to the UN office for 
delivery to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali.

  [Excerpts] Gaza -- In a statement distributed yesterday, 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] denounced the policy of 
deception that the Palestinian side is pursuing with regard to 
the agreements that are being reached and the fact that it is 
not telling the truth to the people. This, in contrast to Rabin 
and his government who are proudly informing their people about 
the agreements reached with 'Arafat. 
  This statement came in response to the meeting held last 
Wednesday in Cairo, the day of the signing of the agreement [4 
May], between Muhammad Dahlan and Jibril al-Rujub with the head 
of Shin Bet. 
  In its statement, Hamas criticized the reported cooperation 
between the two sides in the security sphere and the exchange of 
information about the activities of Islamic forces in Gaza. 
[passage omitted] 
  The statement added: During the meeting, the Shin Bet head 
forced Dahlan and al-Rujub not to prosecute collaborators, and 
al-Rujub confirmed this to the news media. 
  In its statement, Hamas denounced the fact that those at the 
meeting permitted themselves to aid in the liquidation of a 
large sector of their people for rejecting the occupation and 
its consequences. At the same time they committed themselves 
not to prosecute collaborators, who played an important role in 
the establishment of the special units and the protection of 
settlers. 
  In its statement, Hamas stressed that it will continue the 
march regardless of the cost.

  [Text] Within reactions to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the 
Islamic [Resistance] Movement, Hamas, said that the agreement 
and the resulting sell-out and dissipation of Palestinian rights 
has exceeded all limits. In a statement today, the Movement 
voiced its strong rejection of the agreement's provisions and 
all its repercussions on the Palestinians. It said the 
agreement is expected to have serious connotations and 
repercussions which might result in confrontations among the 
Palestinian people themselves, something which the Israelis had 
been endeavoring to realize for a long time. 
  The Movement said: We are apprehensive that when the 
Palestinian police arrive in the Gaza and Jericho areas, they 
will be transformed into forces whose aim would be to continue 
arrests among our people instead of providing security, 
reassurance, and stability which were denied the Palestinian 
people for a long time. 
  The Movement hoped that the Palestinian police force will 
back their Palestinian brothers and will not be a burden to 
them. It warned that the Movement will not sit idly by if these 
forces adopt the role of an honest guard to the Zionist settler 
presence. 
  The Movement said that if the 'Arafat leadership followed 
the 
policy of gagging people, confiscating their liberties, and 
imposing emergency regulations on the citizens, it will enter 
into a big labyrinth and the situation will become like a powder 
keg, liable to explode at any moment.

  [Text] A media spokesman for the unified Central Command 
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has 
said that intense pressure is being applied on their detainees 
inside the prisons of the Israeli occupation authorities to 
secure their approval of the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  The spokesman said in Damascus today that Israeli 
authorities 
have been seeking to strike a demeaning and cheap bargain with 
the detainees requiring them to undertake in writing that they 
support the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  The detainees, noted the spokesman, rejected the deal that 
seeks to deprive them of their legitimate right to pursue the 
fight against occupation and settlement activity. He urged 
human rights organizations to move to obtain freedom for the 
detainees and guarantee their right to free self-expression.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "That Israeli Storm"] </F>
  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has created a 
serious political storm by claiming that a statement attributed 
to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat on Jerusalem was a threat 
to the peace agreements. 
  The world shook and judgments were passed after the 
statements attributed to Yasir 'Arafat about jihad for 
Jerusalem, a recording of which was broadcast by Israel radio 
the day before yesterday. 
  We heard that the Palestinian president made the statements 
attributed to him at a mosque in Johannesburg in South Africa. 
Regardless of the circumstances in which the statements were 
made, how accurately they were reported, and the timing of their 
reporting, one week after the fact, Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin has insisted on exploiting the event and on 
regarding it as "a serious violation of his ['Arafat's] written 
undertakings which threatens the peace process." Rabin's 
escalation got sympathy from U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher who directed his aides to investigate the statements. 
  All that despite the fact that there was no Palestinian 
confirmation of the alleged statements and despite the fact that 
a responsible U.S. source said that there should be no 
exaggeration of what was alleged to have happened or what did 
happen. Even [Israeli] Communication and Culture Minister 
Shulamit Aloni -- of Meretz, which supports full withdrawal from 
the occupied territories -- downplayed the "seriousness" of the 
statements and said that 'Arafat perhaps wanted "to voice his 
fear of the fait accompli and disappointment at having gotten 
less than he had hoped for" in the negotiations with Israel. 
  Judgments have been passed with hints of jeopardizing the 
withdrawal program and reneging on the agreements even though 
the whole story is hearsay. Regardless of what 'Arafat did or 
did not say, the fact remains that Jerusalem, the first qiblah 
[to which Muslims used to turn in their prayers] and the third 
holy place, belongs to the Muslims, and Israel should realize 
this fact. 
  By contrast, and this is what is really strange, the charge 
made by the UN observers in Hebron yesterday that the Israeli 
Army was preventing them from carrying out their mission as 
observers of Palestinian safety in the city, has passed 
unnoticed, and the words and actions of Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud 
Olmert (a former minister in the Likud government) and his call 
for the confirmation of Jerusalem as "the unified and eternal 
capital" of Israel, disregarding the feelings of Muslims and 
Christians throughout the world, have fallen on deaf ears and 
blind eyes. 
  We talk and are blamed, and they act and are acquitted.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "So That Christopher's Mission Will Succeed"] </F>
  [Text] Once again U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher returned to the region yesterday on the limited 
mission of invigorating the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track. 
He is bringing with him the Israeli Government's answers to a 
number of questions posed by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
during his last meeting with the U.S. secretary, in preparation 
for the resumption of the bilateral talks. No date has yet been 
set for holding these talks in Washington because of the 
fundamental differences that continue to separate the Syrian and 
Israeli positions. 
  Certainly, the progress achieved so far has been too little 
and too slow. Syrian-Israeli differences revolve around the 
principle of implementing international resolutions, especially 
with regard to Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Golan 
Heights in accordance with Security Council Resolution 242. So 
far Israel has refused to do so and has added a number of 
preconditions to any partial withdrawal to which it will agree. 
It is also evident that past U.S. efforts, including the 
shuttle trips by former Secretary of State James Baker and 
Secretary Christopher, have failed to bridge the existing major 
gap and, consequently, failed to give impetus to the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiating track. 
  Naturally, creating such an impetus and emerging from the 
stalemate require serious U.S. positions that press for 
implementing international resolutions, particularly Resolution 
242. Hence, talk about gradual and partial withdrawals from 
occupied Syrian lands without knowing the extent of Israeli 
commitment to full withdrawal, and a demand for full peaceful 
relations with a prior commitment to this, do not conform with 
the stated aims of the peace process and flagrantly contradict 
the required trust for peacemaking. 
  In short, so that the U.S. secretary of state's upcoming 
tour 
of the region will not be similar to the previous ones, what is 
required today is more than the idea of partial withdrawal and 
is confined to clear Israeli respect for the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the commitment to implement them. 
This will open the way to invigorating the talks. Such a 
development requires a real and serious effort by the U.S. 
secretary during his talks in Israel rather than in Damascus. 
Otherwise, the entire peace process will remain at a standstill 
despite the limited achievements made so far.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Christopher's Visit to Jericho"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit 
to Jericho yesterday reflects his country's interest and that of 
the international community in general in the steps achieved by 
the peace process, most prominent of which was the Palestinian 
Authority's assumption of the security task in and the 
administration of the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  As far as the Palestinians are concerned, Christopher's 
visit 
expresses the continuation of the role of the participating 
sponsor which the United States has been fulfilling since the 
Madrid Conference. The U.S. secretary's remarks in Jericho 
affirmed this sense through the words of encouragement and 
support. The visit provided an opportunity to Secretary 
Christopher to be apprised the situation in the interim rule 
area in all its aspects and from the first days of the 
Palestinian National Authority's assumption of its task. 
  Needless to say the construction of the new-born Palestinian 
entity will begin from zero. On this basis, the supporting role 
of the United States and of other donor countries in building 
the Palestinian economy and infrastructure must not be delayed, 
since the interim stage stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles [DOP] has already begun. The DOP has 
been supported by the international community as the first step 
toward the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  The Palestinian side has proved, in practice, its commitment 
to peace and to the agreements signed with the Israeli side. It 
is up to the parties that are eager to promote and expand the 
peace project -- amid a harsh and difficult environment -- to 
create the suitable conditions for rebuilding the Palestinian 
edifice in all spheres. This is because, on one hand, peace 
does not endure amid suffering and misery. On the other hand, 
the repercussions of what takes place on the Palestinian track, 
whether positively or negatively, will affect the other Arab 
tracks which are looking forward to the Palestinian example to 
draw the appropriate lessons and conclusions. 
  Undoubtedly, this visit by the U.S. secretary of state 
represents the beginning of action by various parties and 
international forces that support peace. The sons of the 
Palestinian people are awaiting a practical response to this 
action after having suffered a long time under total Israeli 
occupation and its consequences on the Palestinian economic 
infrastructure in general.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Swift and Justified Palestinian Revenge"] </F>
  [Text] The fedayeen operation carried out by the men of 
the intifadah in Hebron yesterday, resulting in two Israeli 
settlers being killed and a third wounded, was in retaliation to 
the attacks carried out by armed settlers on the people of the 
town which left at least 18 people wounded. 
  The striking thing is that the Palestinian retaliation was 
carried out one day after the incident in question -- which 
means that there is a decision not to stay silent about any 
Israeli attacks in the future, whether in Hebron or elsewhere. 
  The Israeli authorities are responsible for these violent 
incidents. Because they defied the international will and 
sought to continue to humiliate the Palestinians when they 
refused to remove their settlements and settlers from Hebron in 
the wake of the tension that dominated the area following the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which resulted in the martyrdom of 
at least 100 people. 
  When Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid says that 
coexistence between the Arabs and the Jews in the town is no 
longer possible, he is adding nothing new. All settlements in 
the occupied territories represent for the Arabs a constant 
provocation and an obstacle to any peace process. 
  The Rabin government wanted to use the Hebron settlements in 
particular as a bargaining chip to secure some concessions from 
the PLO. Because it knew that the latter was in an embarrassing 
situation after the massacre. And now it is realizing just how 
costly that reckless and unstudied action has proved to be. 
  What applies to the Hebron settlements applies to the Gaza 
Strip settlements, whose population does not exceed 4,000 
settlers and which do not represent any economic or security 
value aside from disrupting the Palestinians' existence and 
continuing to embarrass the Palestinian leadership. 
  In the past Israeli governments have used security as an 
excuse to build and expand settlements. But since Iraq's 
al-Husayn missiles landed in downtown Tel Aviv without missing 
their targets even once, all these pretexts and excuses have 
collapsed and the settlements have become a burden on the 
security of Israel and the Israelis and the object of Arab and 
international criticisms. 
  It is fortunate that the Israeli tide of violence and the 
swift Palestinian revenge for those wounded by the settlers' 
bullets should coincide with Israeli [as published] Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's visit to the region in the framework 
of his shuttle between Damascus and occupied Jerusalem to 
reactivate the Israeli-Syrian track. Prehaps Christopher 
realizes for the umpteenth time the danger of continued Israeli 
occupation and its impact on peace and stability in the region 
as a whole. 
  Israel, which is submitting a long list of impossible 
conditions and giving priority to normalization before any 
positive step regarding withdrawal, is refusing to abandon many 
of its aggressive aspects so that it can become a state, like 
other states, that respects international law. 
  It is unnatural for international observers to enjoy respect 
and cooperation from host states throughout the world, and 
nothing but scorn, maltreatment, and spying [from Israel], as 
mentioned by a Danish newspaper, quoting circles close to Danish 
soldiers in Hebron. 
  The crisis lies in the presence of a man like Rabin, who 
continues to think like a general and has no clear strategic 
views for peace. This is why he and his government continue to 
act haphazardly inside and outside the occupied territory. So 
we must expect more surprises in Hebron and elsewhere in the 
coming days and months.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Liamine Zeroual to the Transitional </F>
National Council in Algiers on 18 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Mr. Head of government; members of the government; Mr. 
Chairman of the Maghreban Consultative Council; their 
excellencies, members of the Diplomatic Corps; ladies and 
gentlemen. 
  I would like to start by expressing my happiness and 
satisfaction at being present here with you at this ceremony in 
which we are inaugurating the Transitional National Council. 
  The setting up of the Transitional National Council is the 
realization of one of the main decisions taken at the Conference 
of National Concord; the conference that gave the country the 
platform for defining the aims of the transitional period. 
  On this occasion, it is appropriate that I should reiterate 
my firm conviction to work for the realization of the aims of 
this platform. 
  I would also not want to miss this opportunity to applaud 
you, O members of the Transitional National Council, and applaud 
other parties, organizations and institutions that you are 
representing, for your sense of responsibility by answering the 
call of duty in order to serve the higher interest of the nation. 
  Furthermore, through this patriotic commitment of yours, you 
have responded positively to the call of the nation and 
consolidated, thanks to your stance, the legitimate aspirations 
of our people that Algeria will surely successfully surmount the 
current difficulties. 
  The Transitional National Council, which forms one of the 
necessary foundations to complete this decisive stage 
fruitfully, is also considered an important instrument for 
carrying out the program to get our country out of the crisis, 
and realizing democracy in the framework of respect for the 
deep-rooted values of the Algerian people. With the acceptance 
by all of us of the leadership of the transitional stage, we 
will have responded to the call of the people, and I am 
persuaded that, with the help and grace of God, we will be able 
to pool efforts to realize all the objectives mentioned in the 
national consensus platform agreed a few months ago, 
particularly those pertaining to the organizing of free and 
democratic elections that give substance to the options of the 
nation in all freedom. 
  The national people's army, which adheres to the 
Constitution, will be a guarantor for any political solution in 
this framework. 
  The setting up of the Transitional National Council, which 
comes after the installation of the National Economic and Social 
Council, confirms the principal feature of the approach we have 
chosen to deal with the problems experienced by our country. 
This approach consists of political and social consultation, 
especially as the current situation makes it necessary for all 
the patriots who are concerned for the country's stability to 
fully mobilize themselves so as to make the transitional phase 
successful and get the country out of its plight. 
  Your council is a tangible expression of the mobilization of 
all those who believe in the potential of the country and are 
working to bring national political life back to normal. I am 
convinced that you will be working in this direction in total 
belief and conviction. 
  Gentlemen, ladies: The track of democratic edification that 
we started is a demand that emanates from the depths of society. 
We strive to entrench it, not as a method dictated by 
circumstances but because we are convinced that, thanks to 
pluralist democracy, it enables us to provide a qualitative 
mutation for our country that will permit it to resume its 
ambitious project of economic and social development. In this 
respect, I should like to make clear that by edifying democracy 
we will endeavor to strengthen political society, and at the 
same time entrench civil society. Because each of them has its 
own particular role and specific function in society -- they 
complete each other, and we do not want to see any of them as an 
alternative to the other. Here lies the theme of our efforts 
aimed at launching a political dialogue in a legal framework and 
for a specific objective. 
  The framework of the dialogue should fall within the context 
of respect for the Constitution and the law and the rejection of 
violence, which perpetrators and those who have been conniving 
with them have been wantonly carrying out against the nation. 
  The aim of such a dialogue is, however, to unite the efforts 
and to bring together the resources of our nation in order to 
realize the aims of the transitional period as stipulated by the 
platform of the National Concord Conference. This is the 
framework and the aim of a dialogue, which should be a 
constructive one, open to all those who are prepared to put the 
interests and the unity of the Algerian people before any other 
consideration. 
  This dialogue should not be, however, based upon particular 
partisan choices, rather it should be focused upon the nation's 
great problems, which have been awaiting urgent solutions. 
  Our call for a dialogue without excluding anyone stemmed 
from 
our deep conviction that it is the best means that will allow us 
to unite all national forces, which have nothing to do with 
extremism and other imported ideas, regardless of their origin. 
However, I would like to point out here today in front of you 
that my endeavor -- which I initiated last March within the 
framework of reviving the political dialogue -- was not properly 
understood by a number of parties. 
  Therefore, every one must define his position in all 
clarity in accordance with the specified framework and 
objective, and away from any of the calculations or maneuvers 
that have become known to domestic public opinion. Concerning 
the state, I affirm here that it will be bearing without 
hesitation, and with all determination, all its commitments to 
leading the transitional stage. In this respect, the 
restoration of stability in the country and the preservation of 
the security of individuals and property are top of the 
priorities. Furthermore, the state will continue the 
realization of these objectives without a pause until violence 
and terrorism are definitively eliminated from our society. 
  I would also like to greet and praise our national people's 
armed forces, security forces, cadres, men of culture, and all 
the citizens who are standing courageously in the face of the 
enemies of our homeland. We will eliminate violence and 
terrorism in our society within the framework of law. This is 
our will and determination. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the Transitional National Council must 
above all be vigilant in respecting the Constitution and the 
platform of national consensus. It also constitutes an arena 
for consultation and democratic debate on the main issues of the 
nation. 
  There is no doubt that it will be the best place for 
reinforcing the exercise of pluralism and democracy demanded by 
all. Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the challenge and 
the weight of the responsibility falling upon you to make this 
institution successful in carrying out its tasks is self-evident. 
  There is no doubt that the cross-section of people who make 
up your council will, thanks to their attributes and 
capabilities, know how to live up to the legitimate aspirations 
of our people. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we have emphasized time and time again 
that we desire to continue the structural reforms of the 
national economy and to establish the market economy system. 
These reforms are such as to allow our country to exploit its 
national resources in a rational manner; it will lead to a 
renewed respect for work and effort and will open up the way for 
our creative energy. 
  We are convinced that this endeavor will in fact respond to 
the new requirements of the development of our country, and the 
changes currently marking the world economy. Likewise, the 
market economy we are seeking, and about which many economic and 
social partners are asking questions, we want it to be built on 
consultation and social justice . Effectively, there will be a 
participation of economic entrepreneurs, social partners and 
experts in the laying down of the major orientations of the 
national economy, and in assessing the work undertaken in the 
field. At the same time, the state will ensure that the burdens 
caused by economic reforms are equitably borne, and with all 
vigilance the state will also ensure that social justice 
prevails and national solidarity is promoted. 
  It is also self-evident that the state will continue to 
perform its' role as an active element in national economic 
development. Thus, and thus alone we can control the new course 
that the national economy has embarked on, to make it produce 
the hoped for results and minimize as much as possible the 
negative consequences that might appear. 
  No doubt you are aware that our economy is at a cross-roads. 
It is also easy for you to realize the significant role of your 
institutions to tackle the new challenges that are awaiting our 
country. 
  The responsibility lies on the shoulders of your council to 
be keen on the principles of modernity, progress, social justice 
and national solidarity, which will all remain the firm basis of 
the eternal November revolution. 
  Every effort is being deployed to ensure a patriotic 
training 
based upon new methods aimed at promoting all Algerians and 
particularly young people who are the true wealth. More chances 
of employment should be given to young people. Thanks to the 
continuous effort in the field of training, young people should 
regain the position that is theirs on the path of development. 
  At the same time, the younger generations will play an 
increasingly bigger role in the running of the nation's affairs. 
This is a new fact that is reflected in reality through the 
membership of your council. 
  As regards our community abroad and as I have previously 
stressed, it will receive a special focus in whatever action we 
undertake for the benefit of our homeland and people. 
  The state will ensure the protection of our community 
abroad, 
it will also make all the necessary arrangements to allow it to 
consolidate solidarity among its ranks and to fully take part in 
national development, in which it has a role to play. 
  Ladies and gentlemen: Algeria will work at international 
level to consolidate its relations of good-neighborliness with 
fraternal countries and to revive the process of the building of 
the Arab Maghreb, which it views as a historical and strategic 
aim in the region. 
  It will continue, with the same spirit, its endeavor to 
clean 
up the political atmosphere in the Arab arena and bring about 
solidarity in the African continent. 
  At the same time we would like to reiterate our 
determination 
to bolster and consolidate relations of cooperation and 
integration with Mediterranean countries. 
  Algeria will naturally continue to show an interest in the 
expansion of its cooperation with the European Union and the 
rest of the foreign partners based upon mutual respect and 
reciprocity. 
  Ladies and gentlemen: I have already affirmed my conviction 
in a strong and an ambitious Algeria that is able to face up to 
the challenges and to mobilize all its resources in a bid to 
make a real break with all negative methods and behavior. 
  However, we would like such a change to be comprehensive, 
in which all patriotic political, economic, social, and cultural 
forces would take part in a program that would unite all 
Algerians and would bring as many benefits as possible to our 
citizens from our country's real resources. 
  I am persuaded that, thanks to the joining of your efforts 
with those of the government, this option will gradually turn 
into tangible realities, and open the road to the realization of 
the objectives we have set for ourselves, i.e. serving the 
people and the supreme interests of the homeland alone. We will 
thereby be building a solid foundation with the hope and trust 
that will be resurrected in our countryside and towns, and 
thereby we will be preserving the heritage of the martyrs of the 
eternal November revolution. 
  Finally, I officially announce the installation in its 
functions of the National Transitional Council. I wish you 
success in your tasks and sincere endeavors to get Algeria out 
of its' crisis. Glory and eternal life to our loyal martyrs. 
Long live Algeria. May the peace and mercy of God be upon you.

  [Text] The most prominent event in Algeria today is the 
inauguration of the Transitional National Council. The radio 
team at the headquarters of the former National People's 
Assembly will give more details. Over to Messaoud Aouchallouch: 
  [Messaoud] Yes, Rachid. Ladies and gentleman, peace be upon 
you. Rachid, the official inauguration ceremony began at about 
1105, presided over by Liamine Zeroual, the state president. 
The president gave an address at the beginning of which he 
focused on the importance of the Transitional National Council 
as an institution which embodies one of the most important 
resolutions of the National Consensus Conference and one of the 
essential foundations for the fruitful completion of this 
decisive stage. It is also considered an important means of 
implementing the program to extricate the country from the 
crisis and achieve democracy within the framework of respect for 
the deep-rooted values of the Algerian people. 
  Liamine Zeroual made a point of recalling the state's 
obligations to achieve all the goals of the platform of national 
consensus, especially those related to organizing free and 
democratic elections which give the choice of the nation full 
sovereignty. He noted that this council emphasizes the main 
characteristic of the government's endeavor to tackle the 
problems of the country; this endeavor is reflected in the 
political and social consultation. 
  The state president seized this opportunity to explain a few 
positions around which a lot of controversy was aroused in 
respect of the efforts aiming at reviving the political and 
social dialogue within a legitimate framework and specified 
objectives, as he described it. Liamine Zeroual said: Our 
invitation to dialogue -- he said this as an explanation -- our 
invitation to dialogue emanates from our deep conviction that it 
is the path that will allow us to gather all national forces 
which are far from any extremism and imported ideas from 
whatever source. However, I would like to make clear to you, 
the state president went to say, that the effort which I began 
last March within the framework of reviving the political 
dialogue was not understood correctly by some parties. 
Therefore, it is imperative for everyone to define his position 
very clearly according to the defined framework and objectives, 
and away from any calculations or maneuvers. 
  Concerning the state, I would emphasize here, the state 
president added, that it will shoulder, without any hesitation 
and with full determination, all its commitments in leading the 
transitional period. In this respect, the restoration of 
stability to the country and the protection of the security of 
the individuals and properties come at the fore of our 
priorities. The state will continue to achieve these objectives 
without ceasing until the total elimination of violence and 
terrorism from our society. 
  After the head of state's address the national anthem was 
played, and Mr. Bouchaib, the most senior of the members, 
announced that the session was adjourned and that it will resume 
later in a closed session. Regarding the presidency of the 
council, I should point out that according to the latest reports 
this will go to a person who represents the institution of the 
state, Mr. Abdelkader Bensalah, the former spokesman for the 
National Dialogue Commission, who was a member of the dissolved 
National Assembly and chaired one of its committees. He was 
also a director of ECH-CHAAB newspaper and is now a senior 
official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  If the choice of Bensalah as the only candidate is finally 
confirmed, the elections will be unopposed and will take place 
10 days after this inauguration, bearing in mind that Article 34 
of the National Consensus Document stipulates that the president 
of the Transitional National Council should be elected by the 
members of the Council for the duration of the transitional 
period.

  [Text] Kabul, May 19 (AFP) -- At least 20 people were 
killed and 30 wounded in the Afghan capital Thursday [19 May], 
when a rocket hit a crowded checkpoint controlled by Prime 
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami forces, witnesses 
said. 
  The rocket struck as scores of people gathered at the 
checkpoint in the Chelsitoon area in south Kabul, waiting to 
stock up with supplies in the Hezb-held part of the city, ahead 
of this weekend's Moslem Eid festival. 
  Locals said the rocket was fired from a hill controlled by 
troops loyal to Hekmatyar's rival, President Burhanuddin Rabbani. 
  Scores of people had rushed to the checkpoint following an 
announcement on Hezb radio that a blockade of routes to the 
centre of the capital had been lifted because of the religious 
festivities. 
  "I decided to shop at Chelsitoon in the hope of getting 
essentials for our family at cheaper rates and look what has 
happend to me," cried a 35-year old woman, who lost one leg. 
  Meanwhile, fighting was reported around Maidan Shahr, a city 
about 30 kilometers west of here, in the Wardak province. 
  The defence ministry said Wednesday that pro-Rabbani forces 
had overrun the city, but the claim was denied by the 
Hezb-i-Islami. 
  A fighter from Ittihad-i-Islami faction, which is allied to 
Rabbani, said: "Our forces hold the key hills around Maidan 
Shahr." 
  The man, who was undergoing hospital treatment here, said he 
arrived from Maidan Shahr area Thursday after being wounded in 
the fighting. 
  "We got orders to withdraw from the city, even though we had 
captured the it in a very easy fight," he said. 
  The International Commitee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in 
April that 2,500 poeple had been killed and 17,000 injured in 
the fighting betwe@n the forces of Rabbani and the combined 
troops of Hezb and Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam, since the 
beginning of January.

  [Text] Peshawar, May 19, IRNA -- The Afghan Coordination 
Council led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar Wednesday [18 
May] announced that all roads leading to Kabul will be open for 
three days to allow transportation to Kabul during Eid-ul-Azha 
['Id al-Adha -- feast of immolation] Muslim festivity, May 12. 
  In a statement here, the council said that governmental as 
well as non-governmental organizations could carry all sorts of 
relief supplies to Kabul but with the guarantee that it would 
not be served for military purposes and would be distributed 
among the citizens of the city. 
  Kabul has been scene of the longest round of fightings since 
early January when allied forces of Hekmatyar and 'Abdol Rashid 
Dostum clashed with forces of President Borhanoddin Rabbani. 
  According to Afghan sources, the rival Afghan factions are 
presently locked in severe fighting in two provinces, Baghlan 
and Konduz, to capture strategic positions. Meanwhile, armed 
personnel of Hekmatyar and Sayyaf have been fighting since 
Tuesday in Maydan Shahr in Wardak Province.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
stated that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher briefed 
him on all the events of the past two days in his talks with 
officials in Syria and Israel. He affirmed the importance of 
reaching an agreement between the two sides in this regard. 
  At the news conference he held together with the U.S. 
secretary after their talks, which lasted 45 minutes, President 
Husni Mubarak affirmed the importance of continuing the peace 
process until they reach their conclusion and peace is 
established in the whole region. 
  He said that we are working very hard together with the 
Americans to resolve the complicated problems between Syria and 
Israel with the objective of reaching a final solution. 
  President Husni Mubarak said that Syria and Israel are both 
working for peace, but the problem between them needs some time 
to be resolved. 
  On the situation in Yemen, President Mubarak said: I have 
repeatedly warned against the use of force and pointed out that 
force cannot resolve the problem. Since the beginning, I have 
advised that the forces should be separated and that a dialogue 
should be started. The Yemeni president did not accept this 
advice and maintained that there can be no dialogue with these 
people. 
  President Mubarak said that it is very difficult to predict 
what will happen in Yemen. 
  On his part, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
said: 
I have once again come to this country, which has exerted great 
efforts, just as President Husni Mubarak has done his best, to 
help the Palestinians and Israelis sign an agreement. 
  He added that Syria plays an important role in establishing 
peace in the region and that Egypt is always ready to give all 
the necessary help on all levels. 
  President Mubarak made a statement at the beginning of the 
news conference in which he welcomed U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher. He said: Christopher told me about the efforts 
that have been made in the talks between Syria and Israel, 
"because it is very important that the two parties reach a peace 
agreement as they realize their dire need for peace." He 
stressed that the two sides want to continue their negotiations, 
noting that this is the appropriate time to resolve the problem. 
He said that the current developments in Gaza and Jericho were 
discussed, adding: "I am personally following the situation 
there. The morale of the citizens is very high, and the police 
and people are happy because they wish to solve the problem. 
They want to build their homeland after 27 years [of 
occupation]." It is very important to continue the peace 
process until the end so that peace may prevail in the entire 
region. He said: We will work hard toward this goal along with 
the United States to resolve this very complicated problem and 
to reach a final agreement between the Syrians and Israelis. 
  Christopher then made a statement in which he thanked 
President Mubarak. He said: I am happy to return to this land 
and meet the man who contributed such a great deal toward the 
signing of the agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis. 
He said: When I was in Jericho yesterday, I was reminded of 
President Mubarak and saw that dreams have come true. I also 
remembered him when I saw that real progress has been made. He 
said that he remembered President Mubarak because he contributed 
a great deal toward this goal, stressing that Egypt is worthy of 
utmost appreciation for the role it played in this respect. 
  Christopher said: Our feeling on the importance of achieving 
peace in the region has been revived. We hope to build on what 
has already been achieved in Gaza and Jericho. This is a sign 
for the people of the region and we hope to build on what has 
been achieved in Gaza and Jericho. This achievement is a sign 
for the people in the region as to what peace can achieve. 
  Christopher said he spoke with President Mubarak about the 
Syrian track, noting that President Mubarak is fully aware of 
developments on this track. I told President Mubarak that we 
have started down the road but it is still long, and Egypt wants 
to help make progress on this track. He said: I am happy to 
exchange views with President Mubarak who always receives his 
guests warmly and always plays an effective role in establishing 
peace in the region. 
  In response to a question on whether he received a message 
from Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat regarding yesterday's 
crisis, Christopher replied in the negative. He said: I 
understand that contact took place between 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo, but I have no details 
about their discussions. Anyway, let me tell you that it is 
important for 'Arafat to keep his commitments to the Washington 
ceremony, putting an end to (?violence) and terrorism in the 
region. He said: "I believe that it is important for him, in 
his capacity as an important leader to whom the world looks up, 
to realize the consequences of his deeds. I hope that this 
situation will be cleared up and hope to receive a report on 
this issue because the United States believes that compliance 
with obligations is fundamental under the circumstances. 
  Answering a question on whether Syria and Israel are close 
to reaching agreement based on what he has heard from Secretary 
Christopher, or whether there still is a gap between them, 
President Mubarak said: I can safely tell you that what I have 
felt this time around is that the two parties are working for 
peace. I have already said that it is a complicated problem 
that needs time, but as long as the talks continue, there are 
great hopes for peace. 
  On whether he received any messages or envoys from north 
Yemen, President Mubarak said: I have not received any messages 
from the Yemeni president about sending an envoy. However, 
about four or five days ago, I asked him to send a special envoy 
to Cairo, so he sent his foreign minister. I held extended 
talks with him. I also stated publicly that the use of force is 
not a form of unity, but a form of occupation because unity 
needs the willingness of both sides to achieve it. [passage 
omitted] 
  With regard to the stand of Egypt, the Arabs, and the United 
States on the crisis in Yemen, President Mubarak affirmed that 
it is difficult to predict what will happen in Yemen. He said: 
All I can say is what I have said many times before, that 
battles and war are an endless condition in Yemen. We have much 
experience in the region. War will not resolve the problem, but 
will cause more hatred, even after the war ends. 
  He added: I advised right from the beginning that the forces 
should be separate, that the forces of the north should be 
distanced from the forces of the south, and that dialogue should 
start. But they did not accept this and now there is no other 
way but a cease-fire to remove the forces from the battleground 
so there can be a dialogue. The president of Yemen ha said that 
there can be no dialogue with these people. I believe that this 
will not go anywhere in the future. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question posed to President Mubarak on the 
message he would like to send to Syria after helping with the 
achievements between the Palestinians and the Israelis, 
President Mubarak said: I do not wish to compare the situation 
of the Syrian track with that of the Palestinian track. 
However, I can tell you that the Syrians want to resolve the 
problem and find a comprehensive solution to it. There is no 
basis for comparison between one case and the other. 
  On whether President Mubarak is ready to play a similar role 
to the one he played in the Palestinian track, the president 
said that they are ready to help if the situation requires their 
help. He pointed out that the U.S. secretary of state held 
discussions with the Syrian officials and exchanged viewpoints 
with them, in addition to listening to various ideas. He is 
trying to help the two sides. 
  The president said: When I meet with President al-Asad, I 
will raise all these issues with the objective of making some 
progress in that direction. 
  Christopher answered the same question, saying: We are at a 
very early stage of this process. The issues presented before 
the Syrian and the Israeli sides are very difficult, as are 
their sub-issues. The road ahead is still very long and I do not 
wish to make any predictions now on whether anything in 
particular will happen in the near future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Baudouin Loos </F>
in Brussels; date not given: "Concerning Some Problems in the 
Middle East"] 
  [Text] [Loos] In Brussels, you have just met your European 
counterparts as well as the Belgian authorities. The Middle 
East peacemaking process, which Egypt actively supports, was one 
of the issues which you addressed. Do you believe it was the 
Palestinians who had to make the greatest concessions? 
  [Musa] I would not speak of "concessions," but I would 
rather 
highlight the fact that this was the first step in a long 
process leading to self-determination for Palestinians. They 
have now obtained certain territories. We do not think the 
issue now is to discuss the importance of these territories. 
The very fact that the Israelis have withdrawn from the 
territories and that power has been restored directly to the 
Palestinians, rather than to the Egyptians or the Jordanians, is 
itself a major political, psychological, and territorial step 
forward. True, there are limitations and conditions imposed on 
the Palestinians, because this is only the first step. 
  [Loos] When PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat refused to sign a 
document as part of the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinan 
agreement, 15 days ago in Cairo, it seems your president, Husni 
Mubarak, became very angry... 
  [Musa] I can only say that a last-minute problem did in fact 
arise. However, 'Arafat had a just claim to put forward at that 
time, and this point was solved immediately, when (Israeli Prime 
Minister) Rabin's letter, which had to be attached to the 
documents, was indeed annexed to the latter. All this can 
undoubtedly be explained by the long night spent in discussions, 
just before the agreement was signed. In Cairo, you saw the tip 
of the iceberg of the kind of problems encountered at every step 
by the parties engaged in the negotiations. 
<H5>  Jewish Settlements Are Dangerous. </H5>
  [Loos] Many Palestinians criticize the fact that the 
agreement does not contemplate putting a stop to Jewish 
settlements in the territories. 
  [Musa] This is a very serious issue which must be tackled 
immediately, and Israel should be advised not to continue to 
expand the settlements, because such a policy is essentially 
very dangerous and is harmful to the peace process. I believe 
this makes sense, and that Israel is aware of it. 
  [Loos] What is you assessment of the problems encounterd by 
the PLO in its relations with the World Bank, which is acting as 
an intermediary between Palestinian autonomy and the donor 
countries? 
  [Musa] The problem lies in 'Arafat leading the PLO, 
considering there is now a territory, and citizens. The 
objective is to transform a resistance organization into an 
administration, and it has taken some time to assess the 
situation. I believe the problems have now been largely 
overcome. 
  [Loos] What is your message to the numerous Israelis who 
reproach Egypt for agreeing only to a "cold peace?" 
  [Musa] This sort of reproach is the language of the past. We 
do not understand the term "cold peace." Peace is peace. We 
have peaceful, normal relations with Israel, which are following 
their course and developing. 
  [Loos] Egypt is considered the U.S.' best Arab ally in the 
region. On the other hand, does your country not view a number 
of issues rather differently? 
  [Musa] We do in fact have excellent relations with the 
United 
States. However, we do not share the same views on certain 
problems such as Somalia, Libya, and regional disarmament. 
<H5>  Sanctions: It is up to the Iraqi Leadership </H5>
  [Loos] What about Iraq? 
  [Musa] Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions, which it 
seems to be doing. Also, in order to enter a new era, it must 
formally renounce any claims on Kuwait and recognize the latter 
as an independent country, one which cannot live for ever 
exposed to such a threat. 
  [Loos] You have said that the sanctions were penalizing the 
Iraqi people excessively... 
  [Musa] Everybody knows that, including Iraq's leaders. It is 
up to them to diminish the suffering, and they know what must be 
done for this to happen. But it would be a mistake to believe 
that the world can forget their adventure in Kuwait without a 
political and legal change taking place. Having said this, I 
must add that we are prepared to contribute to helping the Iraqi 
people, as members of the United Nations and the Arab League. 
  [Loos] What can Egypt do to help extinguish the conflict in 
Yemen? 
  [Musa] We asked for a meeting of the Arab League, but things 
have rapidly developed out of control. We believe the solution 
must include three aspects: a cease-fire, a withdrawal of 
troops, and resuming negotiations immediately on the basis of 
the Amman agreement, which was signed between the two sides on 
20 February but never implemented. We are in touch with both 
sides, but some are hoping for a military victory in the field. 
It must become clear that war leads nowhere, that the country 
must remain united, but without resorting to arms, because this 
would mean long-term instability.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 May (MENA)--A responsible security source 
at the Interior Ministry has stated that eight of the lawyers 
who incited yesterday's demonstration have been arrested upon 
orders issued by the central Cairo prosecution. 
  These lawyers include Mukhtar Muhib-al-Din Nuh, Jalal Sa'd 
'Uthman, Jamal-al-Din Taj-al-Din Hasan, and Salah 'Abd-al-'Alim 
Salim all of whom belong to the Muslim Brotherhood; Qamar 
Muhammad Musa and Muhammad al-Muntasir Zayyat from al-Jihad; and 
Muhammad Hamdan Hifni from the leftist groups. 
  The source said that in the house of lawyer Khalid Muhammad 
Ahmad Badawi they found some videotapes on the Afghani al-Jihad 
group. They also found some tracts with lawyer Jamal Taj-al-Din. 
Some documents that are linked to al-Jihad organization were 
found with lawyer Muhammad al-Muntasir al-Zayyat. 
  In another development, the central Cairo prosecution 
decided 
to imprison 27 lawyers and 12 others from various professions 
for a period of 15 days while they are under investigation. 
They were rounded up yesterday while demonstrating. 
  The prosecution charged these people with rioting with the 
intent to harm public authorities and to endanger public 
security, in addition to the crime of attacking people and 
squandering funds that were set aside for private and public use. 
  The prosecution also charged them with rioting with the 
intention of disturbing general law and order, creating 
sedition, and spreading propaganda intended to disturb public 
security. In addition, they will be charged with demonstrating 
on a public road without a permit and throwing stones at cars in 
Ramsis and 'Abd-al-Khaliq Tharwat streets with the intention of 
destroying them.

Tura today, those released affirmed to correspondents of 
international news agencies and newspapers their rejection of 
extremist ideas. They condemned recent terrorist operations and 
all extremist ideas. They added that having declared their 
repentance, they will now campaign for condemnation of extremist 
ideas. They will warn the youth not to join any group, and tell

  [Text] Cairo, 19 May (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM says 
Israel and the United States have taken practical steps to 
implement the F-15E Eagle aircraft deal. The first batch of the 
advanced aircraft will de delivered to Israel in 1997. The 
newspaper notes that these fighter planes will enable Israel to 
reach distant targets, including Iraq and Iran. 
  In its comment today, AL-AHRAM says this deal has added 
another dimension to the arms race in the region. It has also 
provided further proof that Israel and the United States want to 
maintain their military superiority over the Arabs. In 
addition, Israel will use this superiority as a bargaining chip 
in any settlement with the Arab countries. 
  AL-AHRAM warns that Israel's desire to strengthen its 
military arsenal might harm the peace process because the other 
states might find themselves compelled to increase their 
armament capabilities to achieve a military balance with Israel. 
All this will lead to an arms race in the region.

  [Text] With 11 deputies objecting, the People's Assembly 
decided on Sunday to give President Husni Mubarak unrestricted 
powers for the next three fiscal years to make financial 
allocations for armament and other military purposes. The 
decision meant that Mubarak is authorised to conclude military 
purchases from foreign countries without necessarily making them 
public. 
  The president of the republic was first given this mandate 
in 
1972 and it has been renewed periodically since then. With a 
majority of 380 deputies, the Assembly approved the latest 
extension on Sunday, authorising Mubarak to "issue law decrees 
concerning armament allocations and other allocations for the 
armed forces... [ellipsis as published] until the end of fiscal 
year 1996/7". 
  The objecting deputies, mainly leftists and independents, 
argued that a further extension was unwarranted because secrecy 
was no longer possible in today's world. They stressed that 
their objection should not be misconstrued as objection to 
Mubarak's person. 
  Speaking for the government, Kamal al-Shadhili, minister of 
state for the People's Assembly affairs, said the extension is 
necessary in order to keep the armed forces strong in peace as 
well as in war. He argued that secrecy was essential for 
concluding military purchases, noting that the extension of the 
law comes at a time when the region is rife with military 
confrontations. "Yesterday, there was fighting in Yemen and 
earlier there were hostilities in the Gulf," he said. 
  Jamal al-Sayyid, a former minister of military production, 
also defended the extension as necessary. He said it came at a 
time of an international embargo on the purchase of some weapons 
and military equipment, making secrecy a prerequisite of any 
military transaction. "We all know that Mubarak is an honest 
man and worthy of trust," he said. 
  From the opposing camp, Lutfi Wakid, one of the 1952 
revolution's "free officers" and deputy chairman of the 
left-wing Tagammu Party, said his objection should not be 
interpreted as an indication of disrespect for the president or 
for the armed forces. He said the law was necessary before the 
1973 October War because military purchases had to be kept a 
closely guarded secret. But now, he said, the world has changed 
and secrecy is no longer possible. 
  "The world's largest military supplier, the United States, 
now reveals its military deals in Congress and so do Britain and 
France, and most deals are published by specialised magazines." 
Wakid said it was more honourable for the government and the 
armed forces to publicise their military deals, instead of 
allowing opponents to cast doubts on their actions. 
  The strongest criticism was made by independent Fikri 
al-Jazzar who said the extension amounted to a "rape of 
legislative authority". Although al-Jazzar said his objection 
did not mean that he questioned the president's integrity, he 
recalled that Article 108 of the Constitution states that the 
president should be vested with this authority only in 
exceptional cases. Moreover, he said, the article calls on the 
president to submit to the Assembly reports on the types of 
deals, decisions and agreements he concluded in this respect. 
"Has the Assembly received any reports of this kind?" al- 
Jazzar asked, adding that for the purpose of secrecy a committee 
should be formed and entrusted with informing the Assembly of 
these matters. 
  Al-Jazzar argued that the current armed confrontations in 
the 
Arab world have nothing to do with Egypt and should not be cited 
to justify the extension. "We did nothing to [stop] the 
fighting in Yemen, for example, and consequently this extension 
is not well-justified," he said. A report by the Assembly's 
defence and national security committee said that vesting the 
president with this authority was "for the purpose of dealing 
with the circumstances through which the Arab region is passing." 
  The report said, "Egypt carries the burden of those events 
which influence the security and stability of the entire region 
and which reflect on Egypt's own security and national 
interests. This may prompt Egypt to conclude agreements with 
the aim of acquiring weapons and military equipment and aid. 
There is no doubt that these agreements need quick 
ratification. The allocations for armament and other 
allocations necessary for the armed forces also require quick 
decisions, in view of their secret nature and their importance 
to national security and also in view of their linkage to the 
political relations between states..." [ellipses as published]

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, the 
president of the Republic, has hailed the Juba declaration 
issued by the forces of peace, who are currently meeting in 
Juba. He said the meeting was historic for Sudan in general and 
for the south in particular. The meeting had made positive 
progress on the path toward peace and national unity. He said 
this during his regular meeting today with media leaders at the 
secretariat general of the Council of Ministers. 
  Referring to the Nairobi peace talks, which began today 
under 
the auspices of the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on 
Drought and Development] states, his excellency the president 
said the talks were opening despite attempts to abort them by 
the rebels. He said the rebellion had hoped to abort the talks, 
in order to encourage foreign intervention in support of its 
position. Lt. Gen. 'Umar al- Bashir said he hoped the signing 
of the relief agreement between the government and the rebels 
yesterday would pave the way for relief to pour in to rescue 
those in need in the south. 
  During his meeting with the media leaders, the president of 
the Republic also reiterated Sudan's firm stance on the 
situation in Yemen. He said Sudan supported Yemen's unity and 
was wholly opposed to those undermining stability and unity in 
fraternal Yemen. The leader of the revolution appealed to the 
two conflicting sides in Yemen to resort to dialogue as a way of 
solving the dispute and overcoming the current situation. He 
said that Sudan would not intervene in the Yemeni conflict, and 
that it did not favor either party over the other. What 
concerned Sudan was the resolution of the conflict between 
brothers, who should seek a solution through Yemeni 
constitutional institutions to resolve the current situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Re'uven Shapira] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved in 
principle the establishment of a new police district, which will 
be the sixth, and which will serve as the unified command of the 
police units in the territories. Rabin has thus accepted a plan 
put forth by Police Minister Moshe Shahal. 
  The establishment of the new district means, among other 
things, that some 1,000 policemen and border policemen will be 
drafted to the force. According to the plan, the Israel Police 
and Border Police units will assume responsibility for security 
and order in the territories under the command of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] and will perform many of the tasks 
currently preformed by the Army. 
  The new district will be commanded by a ranking police 
commander and will be called the Autonomy District. It will 
unite the three currently operating subdistricts of Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza. [passage omitted] 
  In the framework of the new police deployment in the 
territories, a unit of 300 border policemen will be set up. It 
will perform guard duties on the roads and crossings between the 
areas of the autonomy and Israel. The new unit has begun 
organizing and drafting men.

  [Text] Police Commissioner Asaf Hefetz today disclosed 
plans to set up a guard unit to secure the passage from Jericho 
to Gaza. The unit, called Safe Passage, will daily guard one of 
the four roads on which Palestinians will drive from Gaza to 
Jericho. The unit consists of 400 border policemen: two 
companies of policemen will drive along the road, and two other 
companies will serve as reserves and will be based in Qiryat Gat. 
  Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin ordered the establishment of this unit to thwart 
terror attacks, arms smuggling, and provocations by Jews against 
Arabs.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Excerpts] "Taking into consideration the circumstances, 
including the Israeli Government's recognition of the PLO, there 
is no public interest in taking administrative action against 
Orient House," outgoing Police Chief Rafi Peled wrote to Uri 
Ari'el, secretary general of the Council of Jewish Settlements 
in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. 
  East Jerusalem's Orient House is the center for PLO activity 
in the town and the West Bank. The building houses the various 
departments of the developing self-rule authority, and meetings 
between the PLO and foreign diplomats are held there. This is 
the first time that the Israel Police has officially confirmed 
that it does not take any action against Orient House because of 
Israel's recognition of the PLO. 
  Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir, who made Peled's 
letter 
public yesterday, retorted that "the large number of daily 
terrorist attacks against Jews on their way to the Western Wall 
and against vehicles belonging to Israelis and tourists in 
Jerusalem are initiated and funded by the PLO office in Orient 
House." He said a PLO flag flies on the building and it is 
guarded by the organization's private militia. 
  "The militia also serves as a police force. It receives 
complaints from civilians and deals with them by exercising its 
might in violation of the law. Orient House officially operates 
under the name Center for Arab Research and also distributes 
funds to some 30 organizations in East Jerusalem," he said. 
According to Me'ir, no action is being taken also against 
Nuzhah House, which is a center of activity for the PLO and the 
rejectionist organizations. The building houses two theaters and 
serves Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. [passage omitted] 
  According to a report by the Mabat Leshalom [Look Toward 
Peace] organization, due to be published in the coming days, 
"Faysal al-Husayni, head of the PLO's office in Jerusalem, is 
preparing the ground to set up a Palestinian `shadow 
municipality' to be called the Jerusalem National Council. The 
council plans to replace all those dealing with the town's Arab 
population, to the extent possible, and will form ties with the 
self-rule's elected council during the interim stage." 
  The report says "the council will have a mayor, deputies, 
comptrollers, nine heads of municipal departments, and its own 
police force. It will have planning, economic, judicial, social 
welfare, cultural, political, religious, finance, and overall 
security departments. It will also have departments for foreign 
relations and ties with Israel." 
  According to Mabat Leshalom, al-Husayni said that the 
authority's establishment is partially aimed at improving the 
Palestinians' ability to bargain in negotiations over the 
permanent settlement. Al-Husayni's spokesman, Ma'an 'Urqayt, 
told Mabat Leshalom that al- Husayni prefers calling the 
authority the Jerusalem Committee. He said the committee's task 
is to provide the residents of East Jerusalem with services, 
because the PLO does not recognize the Jerusalem Municipal 
Council's authority. 
  Mabat Leshalom reports that the PLO announced the 
establishment of a population registry office for East Jerusalem 
called the Palestinian Center for Statistics and directed by Dr. 
Hasan Abu-Libdah. It also set up the Council for Palestinian 
Development and Construction. 
  Mabat Leshalom also claims that the PLO is demanding that 
Israel hand over to it control of 'Atarot Airport, claiming that 
it is situated in the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. 
The PLO has called on foreign airlines not to land at 'Atarot. 
  Referring to Israeli violations of the agreement [not 
further 
specified], Mabat Leshalom notes expansion of the settlement of 
Betar and the Ma'ale Adumim area, as well as the decision by the 
Jerusalem Municipality Planning Committee to build 395 
apartments near the village of Jabal al-Mukabir in East 
Jerusalem.

certificate and undergoing a thorough security check. This 
statement was made by Police Minister Moshe Shahal to our 
correspondent Nisim Qeynan. Shahal added that responsibility for 
guarding the Green Line between the Gaza Strip and Israel will 
be handed over from the army to the Israel Police. In the next 
few days, the police command will take charge of the Lakhish 
region and the Southern Command's home front headquarters, thus 
creating a continuous and uniform command. The minister noted 
that within two weeks, he will announce the establishment of a 
sixth police district to be in charge of the autonomy. The 
police minister made the remarks during a tour of northern Gaza 
Strip today. 
  Commissioner Asaf Hefetz, Israel Police commander, expects 
no 
special problems in conducting safe passage between the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. He expects tight cooperation between the 
Israeli and the autonomy police forces. Today, Commissioner 
Hefetz visited the Northern District for the first time since he 
assumed duty as police chief. He told our correspondent in the 
north Yo'av Aviv that he sees no change taking place on the 
ground following Yasir 'Arafat's call for a jihad.

  [Text] Today, Israel and the Czech Republic signed a

Rabin lauded Czechoslovakia for assisting Israel during the 
Independence War by sending weapons, without which it would have

  [Text] Chinese Construction Minister Hoe Jie, who is 
currently visiting Israel, was yesterday the guest of his 
Israeli counterpart Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer and of Bentziyon 
Melman, the director general of the Public Works Department. 
Jie said that China was interested in utilizing the know-how 
accumulated by the Israeli Construction Ministry and Public 
Works Department in residential construction and the building of 
roads and intersections. He noted that 20 million apartments 
were built in China annually. 
  The Chinese minister expressed the hope that Israeli 
construction companies and the Chinese Government would 
cooperate on building projects in Israel, Third World countries, 
and the Arab world. 
  Construction Minister Jie proposed sending 500 Chinese 
construction workers to Israel and Minister Ben-Eli'ezer agreed. 
  During a tour of the Dead Sea, Jie expressed interest in 
building hotels, as well as a Chinese cultural and medical 
center, including the construction of hundreds of hotel rooms at 
a cost of $80 million at Nahal Haver. 
  The Chinese minister is also interested in establishing the 
Dead Sea project in partnership with Israeli companies. At the 
same time, he wants to build a Chinese leisure resort. Jie also 
visited Tel Aviv's central bus station.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that the homeland's 
higher interests impose on all of us further awareness to 
confront the challenges facing us and to safeguard national 
unity and awakening, particularly at this delicate stage through 
which the homeland and nation are passing. 
  During a meeting at the Royal Hashemite Court today with 
officials in charge of media and press institutions, his majesty 
stressed the constants of Jordan's stand on the peace process, 
represented by the efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just 
peace in the region, and to provide all support and backing for 
the Palestinian brothers in harmony with the Rabat summit 
resolutions of 1974, which stressed that the PLO is the sole and 
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. 
  His majesty stressed the need for the Palestinian brothers' 
cohesion at this critical stage of the Palestine question. 
  His Majesty King Husayn also stressed the need to promote 
coordination among the Arab parties participating in the peace 
process within a framework of frankness, clarity, and mutual 
trust. 
  His majesty acquainted the media and press family with the 
latest developments in fraternal Yemen, stressing that the 
Jordanian stand toward this issue is based on adherence to 
Yemeni legitimacy and unity. He also briefed them on the 
efforts Jordan has made since the beginning of the crisis in 
fraternal Yemen and the signing of the pledge and accord 
document by all the Yemeni parties in Amman, to avoid explosion 
of the conflict and to safeguard fraternal Yemen's achievements 
of unity and democracy. 
  During the meeting, His Majesty King Husayn reviewed the 
latest developments regarding the lifting of the blockade on 
al-'Aqabah Port and the Jordanian decision not to return to the 
peace negotiations until after this issue is settled and after 
the blockade is lifted. His majesty noted that it has recently 
been agreed that the neutral British company, Lloyds, in 
coordination with the United Nations, be entrusted with the task 
of supervising imports of goods and materials to al-'Aqabah. 
  His majesty also reviewed various national and regional 
issues, stressing the need for continuous meetings and contacts 
on all levels to exchange views on latest developments. 
  At the end of the meeting, Information Minister Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani expressed the media and press family's thanks and 
appreciation to his majesty for providing this chance to meet 
with his majesty and for briefing them on various developments 
and national and international issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh </F>
Na'im Qasim by unidentified CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How does Hizballah view recent 
developments in the Christian arena in general, and specifically 
the detention of Lebanese Forces Commander Samir Ja'ja'? 
  [Qasim] The files that were opened recently--files that had 
to do with the party behind the Sayyidat al-Najat 
explosion--were justified by the circumstances that almost 
disrupted civil peace and did a great service to the Israeli 
enemy. We are not in a position of authority that would allow 
us to opens other people's files. We do not think anyone in the 
authority can distanced himself from these old files; once 
opened, these files will involve everyone without exception. I 
do not think that it is proper to do this at time when the civil 
war has ended and peace is returning. I think that there must 
be a distinction between a specific incident or group of 
incidents that pose a threat to modern Lebanon and things that 
happened years ago. The files of these years have been closed. 
Opening them would have a negative effect and will not achieve a 
sound result, in my view. 
  [Correspondent] Some people say that lifting the 
international cover of the Lebanese Forces will also lead to 
lifting Hizballah's cover, particularly the Syrian and Iranian 
protection, because of the party's links to the foreign hostages 
issue. What is your reaction to that? 
  [Qasim] The circumstances that made eyes focus on the 
Lebanese Forces are unique to the Lebanese Forces, the only 
local Lebanese organization that rendered services to the 
Israeli enemy by engaging in domestic sedition. This does not 
apply to Hizballah, which seeks to liberate the land, drive the 
Israeli enemy out of the south and the western al-Biqa', spread 
peace among the people, and serve the community. Hizballah did 
not gain power in the Lebanese arena through dreadful acts; it 
got its status through its sincerity, major sacrifices, and the 
blood of innocent martyrs who served not only the Islamic cause, 
but also the Lebanese cause in the region and helped the free 
people in the Arab and Muslim worlds. 
  Hizballah cannot be the object of a decision that some 
official makes behind his desk on a personal whim. Hizballah's 
roots at the popular and political levels, its relations at the 
local and regional levels, and its sincerity in confronting the 
Israeli enemy give it a kind of organic immunity that prevents 
anyone from gambling with it. We are not a bunch of isolated 
partisan offices; we are a deeply-rooted popular movement known 
to all responsible leaders in this country. 
  As for the foreign hostages, we repeated several times in 
the 
past that we have absolutely no connection with that file. 
There is no sense in reopening that file, because we settled 
the ramifications of that issue at the time. The files that 
should be opened are those hot issues that concern the citizens, 
including social services, preventing sedition, the right of the 
opposition express its views, and freedom for the media. These 
files should be opened instead of files from the past that could 
confuse things or seek to settle accounts with some people. 
  As for Hizballah, we do not rely on any international cover 
for our local existence. You say that some people ask whether 
the cover will be lifted from Hizballah now that it has been 
lifted from the Lebanese Forces. The way the West deals with 
Samir Ja'ja' and what he stands for is generally different from 
the way they deal with Hizballah. We are fighters at the 
international level, because we do not tolerate the continued 
occupation of our lands. 
  [Correspondent] How does Hizballah view the hangings and 
the recent executions in Lebanon? 
  [Qasim] Islamic shari'ah says that a killer should be 
executed if he murders deliberately. This is to deter 
criminals. We in Hizballah back the idea of executions, of 
hanging premeditated murderers until the criminals are deterred 
and in order not to make crime an easy option. 
  [Correspondent] Some believe that things will get worse if 
the domestic situation keeps on its current course. How does 
Hizballah view the need to close all domestic files? 
  [Qasim] We understand the meaning of balances of rights and 
duties and the need for mutual coexistance. But we do not 
understand this balance to mean taking the innocent with the 
guilty to achieve sectarian equality. Had the Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church crime been committed by Muslims, the same measures that 
were taken against the Lebanese Forces should have been taken 
against Muslims, if they were directly accused. That horrible 
act was committed by a team of Christians, so they have to pay 
the price for harming people, violating a place of worship, and 
terrorizing a sector of the Lebanese people. But opening files 
in every direction is not an objective measure; it ruins 
Lebanon. Whoever makes mistakes and undermines public peace 
must be punished. But settling accounts or seeking to control 
things one way or another under the banner of the authority or 
anything else is totally unacceptable. 
  When, after members of the Lebanese Forces were arrested on 
charges of blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, the Lebanese 
Forces party was dissolved and the decision made to suspend 
radio and television newscasts, we said this was a mistake and 
futile, short-sighted measures because taking vengeance on the 
audiovisual media and settling accounts with the opposition on 
the pretext of punishing those who blew up the church reflects a 
narrow-minded outlook and a domineering tendency to silence 
every opposition voice in the country. Such a measure can never 
succeed. We are the only state in the region that is accustomed 
to responsible and candid freedom of expression. We back any 
political practice that refrains from using force to impose some 
party's views on others. Let us all compete to win grassroots 
support. Whoever manages to apply the available peaceful 
methods assumes a certain status and plays a certain role in the 
service of the Lebanese citizen, provided that force is not used 
to disrupt security or impose one's views on others as a way of 
putting pressure on the masses. 
  The Christians' frustration has objective causes that have 
to 
do with the performance of Christian political leaders. The 
bloody conflicts that raged in the eastern area [of Beirut] as 
part of a power struggle and the way some Christian parties 
dealt with the grassroots level and with Christian citizens led 
to that development and created an atmosphere of frustration 
among Christians in general and the Maronites in particular. 
Those bloody confrontations could have been averted. We in 
Hizballah believe that rectifying that internal situation 
requires that all Lebanese citizens be dealt with on the basis 
of actual developments. These developments require an 
Islamic-Christian openness, free of tribal fanaticism.

  [Text] New York, May 18, INA--News of New York mentioned 
that the UN Security Council last evening held a session to 
review what had been implemented of the Resolution 687 and the 
measures required for lifting the embargo. 
  Majority of the members of the Council save the United 
States 
and Britain expressed their confirmation that nothing negative 
to be issued against Iraq. 
  Following the discussions the Russian permanent delegate to 
the UN expressed strong hope that the Security Council would 
acknowledge next July what Iraq had achieved of positive steps 
in implementing provisions of the Resolution 687. 
  The Russian delegate told journalists following the 
Council's 
deliberations that the Russian stance toward the blockade 
against Iraq was a practical one and simple depending on the 
fact that Iraq had made good steps and the Security Council had 
to admit that and "we have proposed that on the council." 
  The French ambassador to the United Nations expressed his 
belief that the general feeling at the Council was that Iraq had 
accomplished a progress in the area of cooperation with the 
special commission. He said the French stance was still the 
same since the previous reviewal, i.e. there was a progress in 
the field of weapons and monitoring and that "we are with the 
legal reading of the Resolution 687 which means that soon after 
Ekeus and the director general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency informed the Council that the monitoring was 
working safely the council would give the green light to lift 
the embargo on exporting the Iraqi oil."

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Apr (INA)--Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn 
Khudayyir has received Jordanian Education Minister Dr. Khalid 
al-'Umari and his delegation. The prime minister emphasized the 
depth and strength of fraternal bilateral relations, especially 
in the educational field, and said these relations are based on 
the common future of the sons of the Arab nation and their 
glorious Arab and Islamic heritage. 
  He praised fraternal Jordan's position toward Iraq while 
confronting the 30-state aggression and the unjust siege imposed 
on it, and emphasized that Iraq will not forget this honorable 
pan-Arab position by the fraternal Jordanian people. 
  Khudayyir said that if Iraq had not built an advanced and 
broad educational base and scientific cadre, it would not have 
been able to rebuild after the sinful 30-state aggression with 
such speed and efficiency. He said this has prevented the 
enemies from realizing the evil objectives for which they 
mobilized all their scientific and military technologies. 
  The prime minister asked the guest minister to convey his 
greetings to the Jordanian prime minister along with his wishes 
for continued progress for the brotherly Jordanian people. 
  Dr. al-'Umari conveyed the greetings of the prime minister 
of 
fraternal Jordan to the prime minister, and his wishes of 
continued progress to the Iraqi people. He emphasized that 
Jordan--people and leadership--is with Iraq in its confrontation 
of the imperialist- Zionist-Atlantic aggression. 
  He said his visit aims to discuss means of implementing the 
educational agreement concluded by the two countries. He said 
he will also get acquainted with the educational experiment in 
Iraq and the results of the unjust siege on the educational 
establishments.

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 May (INA)--Jordanian Education Minister 
Khalid al-'Umari and the delegation accompanying him left 
Baghdad today following a visit to Iraq which lasted several 
days. 
  In a statement to an Iraqi News Agency correspondent, 
al-'Umari said his visit to Iraq follows the implementation of 
an agreement signed between the two fraternal countries. The 
visit also aimed to study the efforts designed to enhance the 
educational system in Iraq following the unfair 30-state 
aggression and in view of the continued unjust blockade, he 
noted. 
  Al-'Umari said he was briefed on the Iraqi people's 
suffering 
as a result of the unfair blockade, on the embargo's negative 
repercussions on the educational process in Iraq, and on Iraqi 
achievements in various fields in order to reconstruct what was 
destroyed in the treacherous aggression of the 30-state 
alliance. He pointed out that the reconstruction campaign 
expresses both defiance and steadfastness, which emphasize that 
Iraq is now a model for all Arabs.

<F P=106> ['Umar al-Kazimi article: "Two Gardens, Not Two Countries;" </F>
article carries the caveat: "This article expresses the opinion 
of its writer, not that of the newspaper"] 
  [Text] In the early eighties, we were a group of young 
adolescent men. At that age, every youth usually has his idol. 
As party members, our idols were not the typical musicians, pop 
singers, or movie stars. There were 10 of us, and we all 
thought our first idol was Saddam Husayn from the way he 
dressed, spoke, walked, and dealt with people, and even by his 
life style. Having agreed on our first idol, we then split into 
two groups. The first group of six or seven viewed [late Iraqi 
Defense Minister] 'Adnan Khayrallah as its second idol from his 
behavior, conduct, and gentle nature. The second group of three 
or four viewed comrade Barzan Ibrahim [Saddam Husayn's brother 
and Iraqi envoy to UN European headquarters] as its second idol, 
because in his youthful years in the eighties Barzan was in 
charge of a most sensitive state organ [Iraqi Intelligence 
Service] and had a background similar to that of comrade 'Adnan, 
although the latter was more experienced since he took part in 
the Ramadan Revolution and its ramifications. But comrade 
Barzan was also with the comrade leader during the 17-30 July 
1968 Revolution. The story goes that comrade Barzan, who 
carried a pistol, had tripped a soldier, who held a machinegun, 
with his foot to protect his brother the leader, because he 
thought the pistol would not serve the purpose. The group that 
considered comrade 'Adnan Khayrallah as its second idol was also 
charmed by Barzan's unusual character. On the other hand, the 
group that considered comrade Barzan as its second idol also 
admired comrade 'Adnan Khayrallah's personality. At any rate, 
this is not the subject of our story. 
  When Barzan's first press article appeared, only three of 
the 
original group of ten remained, the others had pursued their own 
courses in life. We thought the article was interesting. Then 
came the second, third, and fourth articles. Again, we thought 
they were fine and that there was no reason why he should not 
express his opinion. But as the articles continued to appear, 
we noticed that they contained a set of ideas that were 
different from our way of thinking in Iraq. The articles 
continued to move away from us and to get closer to the 
inclinations of persons who live abroad. When we observed that 
these viewpoints began to develop into courses and were followed 
by more articles, which deepened these courses and developed 
them into a program and a firm line, we thought it would be 
proper to reply to them in view of the fact that we are a group 
of young men in Iraq who lived the Mother of Battles, fought in 
Kuwait and Basra, and experienced all the stages of the blockade. 
  Our attention was drawn to an article comrade Barzan wrote 
about the relationship between Iraq and Iran. He spoke about 
this relationship as though nothing had happened between Iraq 
and Iran. He spoke about the sons of our people from the Shiites 
in Iraq, forgetting that Iraqi Shiites are an Arab faction that 
is separated by a river of blood from the Persian faction, which 
claims to be Shiite, and that a big difference in concepts and 
beliefs exists between the two factions, even though the the 
Shu'ubists [Persians] always consider them as one. Moreover, 
many of the Iraqis who fought and fell as martyrs in 
al-Qadisiyah [Iraq-Iran War] were from our Shiite sons, 
especially from the south. This is not a new thing, since it 
has been dealt with in several articles. The theme of comrade 
Barzan's article revolves around the possibility of coexistence 
between Iraq and Iran. 
  In fact, we cannot coexist with Iran. But we should apply 
the Arab proverb that says: "Beware of your friend, but do not 
betray him." 
  But again, this is not the topic of our discussion. The 
topic is an article written by Barzan al-Tikriti in 
AL-JUMHURIYAH under the headline "A Viewpoint on Yemeni Events." 
  Let us review some of its paragraphs. The author said: "What 
is taking place in Yemen is the outcome of a relationship 
between two conflicting regimes that have entered into a unity 
that was received with caution and skepticism by everyone 
concerned, both the sincere and the not-so-sincere ones." The 
author added: "The situation has reached the point of merciless 
fighting between brothers in which aircraft and heavy weapons 
are being used and battles are taking place as if between two 
foreign armies. Airports and power installations are being 
destroyed." 
  Actually, the current events Yemen are related to an 
ideological analysis of the phases that preceded and followed 
the Mother of Battles. After 2 August [1990] to be precise, the 
curtain was pulled and the Arab regimes were exposed. Nobody 
believed us when we said that at the time. It is only now that 
we are beginning to discover that many Arab regimes, whether in 
the Arab Maghreb or the Arab East, have had ties with "Israel" 
for decades. This frightful relationship has been under cover 
all that time, and it is only now that it is being announced 
publicly. Indeed, Arab regimes were exposed after 2 August and 
the Arab homeland was split into two ranks; the rank of faith 
and the rank of infidelity, to borrow the words of the leader 
president. The split was so clear cut that the vote that tipped 
the balance in the Arab League meeting on the blockade and the 
armed aggression was that of Djibouti. 
  The Mother of Battles took place and was followed by a new 
phase. So what happened? Following the armed aggression and the 
period of treachery and treason [reference to the Shiite 
rebellion in the south], and due to Iraq's preoccupation with 
its domestic situation and the lack of an active Iraqi diplomacy 
and of professionals in foreign policy, the supporting Arab 
ranks collapsed and the number of supporters decreased. 
  Let us see what happened. Morocco remained neutral, but also 
maintained a clandestine courtship with the other side. Tunisia 
maintained a position that was very different from the one it 
held before the aggression on Iraq. As for Jordan's stand, it 
is clearly known to the Iraqis. 
  Why do we say there are two conflicting regimes in Yemen? On 
the contrary, when Iraq was strong and had an army that extended 
from Zakho to al-Faw; and when it enjoyed a well-known political 
weight and was not under siege, Yemeni unity was a model that 
inspired Arab poets and unionists, and Yemeni relations were at 
their peak. But the fact is, Yemen began to be subjected to 
Saudi intrigues. In an article published on the front page of 
an earlier issue of BABIL, comrade Abu-Sarhan [suspected to be 
'Udayy Saddam Husayn] referred to Yemen's courtship with Saudi 
Arabia after the armed aggression against Iraq. He said, 
verbatim: "If Yemen continues to play with fire the way it is 
doing now it will burn its fingers." When Yemen began 
compromising its principled stands, it backfired on the Yemeni 
body itself. If we look now, we will find that the current 
events in Yemen were preceded by one Yemeni side clearly moving 
in the direction of the sides that were hostile to Iraq, while 
in the past the Yemenis maintained a unified stand. 
  Thus, Yemeni events are indirectly linked to what took 
place in the Mother of Battles and the subsequent developments. 
What happened makes us understand the importance of 
strengthening the support for Iraq that is now receding. 
  At any rate, let us continue discussing the subject of 
Yemen. 
Looking at the Yemeni fighting, which comrade Barzan said is 
taking place between two armies and where airports and power 
installations are being destroyed, we will observe that it is 
similar to the military plan the foreign enemies used against 
Iraq, which also targeted power and water installations, 
factories, and so forth. Therefore, the plan being carried out 
in Yemen today is not just an outcome of the conflict between 
Yemenis, but also a plan drawn up and studied abroad in order to 
achieve the objective of dividing Yemen. The existence of a 
strong Yemen south of Saudi Arabia and a strong Iraq north of it 
constitutes a strategic danger to the ruling family in the 
Arabian Peninsula. Iraq and Yemen cherish pan-Arab aspirations. 
Yemenis have always been known for their Arab nationalist 
sentiments and are true Arabs. Proof of this is that Judaism 
had existed in Yemen, but it has not had any effect on Arabs 
there. When Imam al-Husayn [grandson of Prophet Muhammad and 
first Imam of the Shiites who was assassinated in al-Kufah, 
Iraq], may peace be upon him, decided to leave for al-Kufah, 
'Abdallah Ibn- 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab, may God rest his soul in 
peace, asked him: "Where are you heading, Abu-'Abdallah?" He 
replied: "I am heading for al-Kufah." He told him: "Why do you 
not go to Yemen, where your father's Shiites [referring to 
Yemeni Zaydi sect, an off-shoot of Shiism] live and where you 
will have the protection of the mountains." As politicians, we 
know that mountainous areas are ideal for rebel armed movements. 
When our lord al-Husayn insisted on going to al-Kufah, 
'Abdallah Ibn-'Umar told him: "Come, let me bid you farewell." 
  As we said, what is taking place in Yemen was planned and 
studied abroad ever since the declaration of Yemeni unity, and 
it was intensified after the Mother of Battles. 
  Let us continue with comrade Barzan's article. He said: 
"What led to the general war was the view held by some people 
that say: Either we have full unity, or a general destructive 
war will be the only alternative." 
  It was a full unity. And, a general war is not an 
alternative to unity. A general war is a means to destroy unity. 
  The author also said: "The world was not created in one day 
so as to be united in one day. Unity between states takes time." 
  The creation of the world was a heavenly will. When God 
Almighty created the world in seven days, He wanted to teach 
patience to mankind. Regarding Arab unity, we have to be clear 
on this score. The author, who is posted in the West, will 
understand us when we say: One of the great historical unity 
experiments was the unification of Germany under Bismarck. 
Germany was then unified by force of arms. A second great 
experiment was the American federation between the southern and 
northern states, which was also achieved by force of arms, and 
by a method similar to the one taking place now in Yemen. 
  Let us consider the Arab reality. What do we see? We see 
an egotistical Arab individual who loves shaykhdoms and being a 
shaykh. At a time when suzerainties have vanished from the 
world, shaykhdoms are still deeply-rooted in the Arab homeland. 
No Arab unity has been achieved without the use of armed force. 
Armed force has always been the means to Arab unity. As for 
the rulers, they have always tried to entrench regionalism. We 
thank God that Yemenis understand the meaning of this war. They 
rejected mediation, because if they had accepted them Yemen 
would have been divided, as is now happening in Yugoslavia. But 
the war has now become a war to unify the country by armed 
force; in other words, a full liberation war. This situation is 
similar to what they wanted to happen in Iraq during the period 
of treachery and treason. They wanted to strengthen the 
secessionist trend and then declare the division of Iraq into 
three states according to the well-known scenario. 
  Barzan said: "What is happening in Yemen is a repetition of 
past Arab unity attempts; the usual relationship which begins 
with hugs and kisses and ends up in disputes and war." 
  Previous attempts at Arab unity have not been a unity of one 
Arab people in two countries, but a unity sought for political 
purposes and ideological ends. Every Arab ruler sought to take 
whatever he could from the other in order to increase his assets 
and improve his image before his people. Therefore, there was 
no real Arab unity. The real unity is the one known to the 
Iraqis and is unity in the real sense of the word. 
  Barzan continued in his article, saying: "The dream of unity 
has developed into fear, terror, and panic. In fact, it has 
become a nightmare, and not just in Yemen." 
  No. Never. All Arab strugglers and all Arabs know full well 
that their real dream is the unification of the nation. They 
understand that their aspirations will not be achieved, their 
identity will not be asserted, and their prestige will not be 
maintained except through unity. Therefore, the enemies of the 
Arabs represented by Zionism and the Americans always try to 
make the Arabs understand that poverty, hunger, injustice, 
panic, and fear result from unity. At the same time, and as is 
now happening with the Iraqis, these enemies are trying, through 
their punishment of Iraq, to create a reaction against unity and 
to scare the Arabs away from future unity. But unity is a firm 
conviction. A person cannot live with one lung, or live a full 
and real life with half a body or a disability. Unity is the 
basic aim of all strugglers and honorable men. Despite all the 
enmity, we still hear hostile forces represented by the United 
States and Britain saying: "The opposition has failed to 
establish roots inside Iraq." We thank God that the opponents 
of the Iraqi regime are no more than a bunch of agents whose 
morality and affiliation to true Arab Iraq are suspect. They 
were known to the Iraqi people even before they became known to 
the persons who rule Iraq by their history, conduct, and 
behavior. 
  I repeat and say that unity is the resort and hope of the 
nation. it is also the paradise and hope of the faithful on 
earth. Therefore, we totally disagree with the author of the 
article when he said: "There should either be a unity that 
respects everyone and guarantees their common rights, or a 
return to the separatist states that existed before." 
  In another part of the article, the author set an example by 
saying: "There are 20 other separate Arab states, but they have 
managed to coexist with one another without bickering and 
fighting." This is what we hope, but how can it be without 
fighting?! 
  The situation reached the point where half of the regimes of 
the nation turned their armies against one people [Iraq] of this 
nation. They provided them with funds and arms. The present 
state of the nation does not augur well. In fact, the nation 
has never been in such a miserable state in its entire history. 
The Arab rulers have not been so daring as to enlist the help 
of the enemy or to deal with Zionism so publicly. We thank God 
that it has finally surfaced, because we will see more such 
developments, God willing, in 1995 when the situation will 
become very clear to everyone. 
  The author of the article cites another example by saying: 
"The other example, although somewhat different, was Syria. 
[Former Egyptian President] 'Abd-al-Nasir decided not to 
reinforce the Egyptian forces in Syria, especially in Latakia, 
in order to strike at the secessionist movement there. 
'Abd-al-Nasir believed that saving unity by bloodshed and 
opening fire on Syrian secessionists would bar all doors to 
rapprochement and unity between the two peoples and countries in 
the future." 
  God bless 'Abd-al-Nasir who was one of the symbols of the 
Arab revolutionary movement, but not the first or only symbol of 
this movement. He was also not a model for nationalists and 
pan-Arabists on the Arab national level. 
  'Abd-al-Nasir took steps during certain historical phases 
that are questionable to this day. One such step was his 
approval of the presence of the Egyptian forces alongside the 
British forces when 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim demanded the restoration 
of Kuwait. The other was his decision to open the Suez Canal to 
foreign forces proceeding to Kuwait. These steps continue to be 
questioned and queried by all nationalists in Iraq. What 
Barzan's article said about Latakia is another point against 
'Abd-al-Nasir, because the position taken by 'Abd-al-Nasir then 
led to the presence of Hafiz al-Asad today. Hafiz al-Asad is 
from the Latakia area. 'Abd-al-Nasir contributed to the 
emergence of the al-Nusayriyah Movement in Latakia when he 
failed to deal his blow then. This movement developed and 
formed the basis for the party's setback in Syria and the 
assumption of power by Hafiz al-Asad, who has adopted hostile 
trends toward pan- Arabism and Iraq. Syria is known for this up 
to this moment. 
  The brothers in Yemen have done well. There is no 
alternative. And, as the poet says: Honor can only be redeemed 
by bloodshed. 
  Therefore, Yemen -- land and people -- will not be redeemed 
except by sacrifices. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  "There was for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their homeland -- 
two gardens to the right and to the left. Eat of the sustenance 
provided by your Lord, and be grateful to Him; a territory fair 
and happy. And, a Lord oft-forgiving." [Koranic verse]

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F>
revolution, in Tehran on 18 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] If the great Islamic ummah 
throughout the world accepts that they have been negligent of 
Islam, if the world Muslims admit that they have taken the wrong 
road in following anti-Islamic powers, that they have erred in 
accepting the corrupt and beguiling culture of the west. If 
they own up to that, their path will be clear and they will be 
able to reform themselves. 
  Global propaganda seeks to mislead nations so that they will 
be unable to understand what is right and what is wrong. You 
can see this propaganda, these scintillating global 
advertisements, and hear these radio broadcasts, how they try to 
publicize political matters, economic ideas, consumer goods, and 
other similar things. 
  The Iranian nation, which succeeded in creating a 
resurrection in this world, which succeeded in reawakening a 
world, and managed to create a great transformation, this 
nation's main secret for achieving this success lies in its 
decision to alter its wrong and false route. This nation 
realized that pursuing the line of the oppressors and tyrants 
and the satanic kings is wrong and it is also wrong to remain 
silent before them. This nation changed course from this wrong 
path and as a result reached prosperity and salvation. The 
Iranian nation has opened a path for other world nations to 
follow. This path of yours is today desired, sought and pursued 
by all the Muslim intellectuals, and by those who have an alert 
conscience in the Islamic world. This is the path to salvation. 
The path of salvation means liberating ourselves from imposition 
and domination of arrogant powers. 
  Unfortunately some Islamic countries have not found this 
path. Some Muslim nations have not been lucky enough to achieve 
this success yet. The traitorous and corrupt leaders have not 
allowed the nations to find their way. 
  About the problems facing the pilgrims in the hajj rituals 
this year, what I can say at the moment is: I am very sorry to 
see that some individuals are preventing the rise of monotheism 
cry in the center of monotheism and next to the house of 
monotheism. At the moment I do not wish to say anything about 
the behavior of the Hijaz rulers and authorities. We are 
waiting to see how they are going to treat our pilgrims. 
Thousands of our people are there today and we are following 
every minute detail of their problems. We hope that they will 
complete their rituals, with the Almighty's help, in full 
comfort and health before returning home. The authorities of 
that place are dutybound to provide all means of comfort and 
health, as well as the means to allow them to perform their 
rights and rituals. This is their duty. We are waiting to see 
whether they will perform their duty toward the Iranian pilgrims 
fully and properly or not. 
  May Almighty God bless this auspicious occasion in the month 
of Dhi al-Hajjah to all Muslims and particularly to our dear 
people, our great and faithful nation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, May 18 (AFP)--An Iranian newspaper on 
Wednesday accused Saudi Arabia of provoking conflicts in the 
Islamic world, including Yemen and Afghanistan. The TEHRAN 
TIMES charged that Riyadh was opposed to peace between the north 
and south Yemenis and had previously done "everything to 
forestall the unification Yemen." 
  "The Saudis have been plotting in Yemen in the past few 
weeks, until they managed to impose a full-scale civil war on 
that country," the English-language daily said. The paper also 
accused Saudi Arabia of "instigating the civil war in 
Afghanistan and of using petrodollars to finance the conflict." 
  Officials and newspapers here have launched a wave of 
attacks 
on Saudi Arabia in the past two days, after Iran was forced to 
cancel an anti-US and anti-Israel rally by its pilgrims in Mecca. 
  The "deliverance from the Infidels" demonstration, which was 
to be held Tuesday, was called off after heavily-armed Saudi 
police reportedly besieged the Iranian pilgrimage quarter to 
prevent them from holding it. Tehran said it had cancelled the 
rally to "avoid a bloodbath." 
  Iran's speaker of parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri condemned 
the ban on Tuesday and accused Riyadh of seeking to "please the 
United States." The Saudis "want to protect the interest of the 
United States. This is the main characteristic of American 
Islam," he said.

  [Text] The Saudi Arabian ambassador in our country was 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry today, where the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's strong protest to the Saudi Arabian 
Government was conveyed to him concerning the siege of the 
exalted leadership's mission in Mecca by Saudi police and 
security forces. 
  During the meeting, Ha'eri-Fumani, adviser to the foreign 
minister and general director for the Persian Gulf [title as 
heard], referred to the cancellation of the ceremony marking the 
disavowal of the infidels by the supervisor of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's mission. This is as a result of the 
difficulties brought about made by the recent Saudi actions, 
which are considered to be contrary to diplomatic -- and even 
humanitarian -- conduct, and as being disruptive to bilateral 
relations. 
  The Saudi Arabian ambassador said that he will convey the 
raised matters to his country's authorities. He claimed that 
the security measures were envisaged in order to safeguard the 
security and health of the hajj pilgrims.

  [Text] Tehran, May 19, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN 
INTERNATIONAL' Thursday said that Saudi Arabia for the past two 
decades has made efforts to alter the centuries-old concept of 
hajj. The daily wrote in its editorial that it was not solely a 
product of "Wahhabi house of Saud" but a declaration jointly 
engineered by the western forces of arrogance. It stressed that 
King Fahd, for understandable reasons, could not tolerate even 
peaceful demos against the U.S., Israel and other enemies of 
Islam on `his' territory. 
  Turning to the deployment of Saudi security forces around 
the 
Iranian pilgrims headquarters this week, the paper noted that 
the heavy military concentration around the building was 
regarded as another recipe for disaster had the `deliverance 
from unbelievers' rally taken place. "The world is not unaware 
of Saudi Arabia's military, political and economic ties with 
Washington and how American strategists (with due help from 
Britain) advise the royal family on everything from gardening to 
foreign-policy making," wrote the article. "If Muslims unite," 
the daily suggested, "no earthly power can resist them. Evil 
powers are well aware of this and thus cannot bear to see 
hundreds and thousands of pilgrims condemning their interference 
in Muslim affairs." 
  KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL concluded by saying that the Saudi 
rulers will never command the respect of the ummah for indulging 
in practices detrimental to the lofty cause of Islam and its 
followers. "They should open their eyes to the stark realities 
of today's world in which nations big and small want their 
leaders to get out of America's satanic orbit. For how long can 
the `guardians of the holy shrines' keep alien interest on the 
top of their national agenda?"

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran will not take part in 
the Western-inspired arms race in the Persian Gulf. The 
commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Navy [Rear Admiral 
'Ali Shamkhani], who is currently in Bandar-e 'Abbas, announced 
the above today and added that Western news agencies' propaganda 
that Iran is competing with other countries in the region in the 
purchase of arms and military equipment is false. He said: The 
arms race Westerners have started in our region is more 
profitable to them than arms races in other parts of the world. 
In fact, this is plundering the wealth of the Muslim people of 
the region. 
  The Navy commander also said: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
has to gain enough strength to protect 2,000 km of its marine 
border, but it believes it can strengthen its defensive 
capabilities by relying on its internal strengths and 
capabilities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "On the Margins of the Visit by </F>
the Kuwaiti Writers and Professors to the ETTELA'AT Institute"] 
  [Text] On the basis of a prepared program, a high-level 
delegation of Kuwaiti professors and writers visited the 
ETTELA'AT Institute and participated in a frank and cordial 
discussion with the editorial board. This constructive 
discussion can be assessed from the following viewpoints: 
  The distance between us and our co-religionist brothers and 
the lack of the proper conditions for creating an "atmosphere of 
discussion" with them, has only generated numerous ambiguities 
on both sides. These ambiguities could be clearly perceived in 
the nature of the issues raised by the Kuwaiti delegates. This 
places an immense responsibility on our shoulders and those of 
our colleagues in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf countries. 
  In other words, a regular exchange of opinions and ideas by 
nonofficial individuals on the regional level can provide a 
clear impression of the attitude of the officials and on the 
other hand, can prove to be an important factor in fostering 
greater closeness and understanding among the peoples. 
  The presence of the Kuwaiti guests in Iran and their 
discussions with their Iranian colleagues could prove to be the 
beginning of a new and dynamic move beneficial to the regional 
nations. For many years, despite Iran's constant declaration of 
its good intentions and its desire for extensive relations with 
other countries of the region based on good neighborliness, the 
fomenters of tension and those who wish to gain by generating 
tension have continued to spread propaganda to the contrary. 
  Adverse propaganda by the fomenters of tension from outside 
the region and by those pursuing illicit interests has resulted 
in many of our brothers in this country adopting certain 
erroneous stances on the basis of this tension-creating 
propaganda. The cordial visit to Iran by a delegation of Kuwait 
professors, writers, and journalists marks the initiation of a 
wholesome trend of exchanging views and perceptions among those 
who play the greatest role in moulding the interests and 
inclinations of the officials and elucidating ideas for the 
peoples of the region. 
  Without doubt, a continuous exchange of opinions and the 
expansion of this trend to the regional level will help to 
eliminate many misunderstandings and fallacious conclusions; and 
the regional countries will thus achieve better mutual 
understanding. This will provide a suitable bedrock of culture, 
inclinations and joint interests, and will become a precursor 
for the creation of an "atmosphere of discussions and exchanges 
of views." 
  We take this opportunity of the visit of our Kuwaiti 
brothers 
to Iran to extend a similar invitation to all our colleagues in 
the other regional countries, to whom we wish to play host. 
Conversely, we are also ready to be guests in their countries. 
In this manner, our co-religionist brothers will be able to 
discuss various issues in a cordial way and so bring the nations 
closer together. We extend our hands to them to create this 
atmosphere of discussion and exchanges of views among 
nonofficial individuals (writers, journalists, university 
professors, and others who do not have any official 
restrictions) and to our colleagues in other countries of the 
region. 
  At least discussions among us will have the advantage of 
being held in a cordial and fraternal atmosphere, and the media 
and extraneous official influences will not be able to affect 
the opinions and inclinations of the people of the region. 
These influences are the factors that generate tension and 
create a climate of suspicion and hostility, and this path is to 
the detriment of the nations of the region.

  [Text] 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, the Iranian deputy foreign 
minister for Asia and Pacific affairs who travelled to Turkey in 
order to convey the Iranian president Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
verbal message to the Turkish president, Mr. Suleyman Demirel, 
returned to Tehran at the end of his one day mission on Tuesday. 
  During the Iranian political envoy's meeting with the 
Turkish 
president, the two sides exchanged views on issues related to 
northern Iraq, bilateral, politico-economic ties and Mr. 
Demirel's forthcoming visit to Tehran in mid-summer. 
  During his brief stay in Ankara, the Iranian deputy foreign 
minister for Asia and Pacific affairs also called on the Turkish 
foreign minister and the two sides focused their discussion on 
bilateral issues. 
  Iran and Turkey have been exchanging views through the 
visits 
of their diplomatic delegations to the two countries during the 
past year and the level of the delegations ranged from deputy 
minister to first vice president level according to the 
significance of the issues under discussion. 
  The Turkish president's forthcoming visit, if it 
materializes, can be considered as the climax of such 
counselling since the new world conditions, such as the White 
House evolved new world order and the U.S. President's efforts 
aimed at spreading the same and imposing the wrong model on the 
rest of the world, as well as the emergence of the Central Asian 
republics and Iran's strategic geopolitical role in the region, 
have made ever greater understanding and closeness between Iran 
and Turkey inevitable. 
  This is significant when the critical situation in northern 
Iraq, which apparently claims to have a kind of independence, 
can actually be a bitter and critical beginning or a political 
test for the division of countries in the region. In view of 
the significance of the issue and not withstanding the two 
countries' efforts for establishing peace and security on the 
joint border, events related to northern Iraq have always been 
on the agenda of Iran-Turkey talks. This is so because the 
continuation of the situation not only means greater instability 
in northern Iraq but it can also create crises for Iraq's 
neighbors: Iran, Turkey, and Syria. 
  There is no doubt that the ongoing crisis in northern Iraq 
is 
largely the outcome of the strategic blunders committed by the 
officials of that country during the early nineties. 
  But the vigilant and farsighted manner in which Iraq's 
neighbors deal with the current situation in that country can 
level the way for the return of durable peace to the region and 
discard domination seeking powers' justification for the 
presence of alien troops in this geographical boundary.

  [Text] The governor of the Central Bank of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran said exchange rates fluctuations are only short 
term. He said: By implementing monetary, foreign exchange, and 
commercial policies the government intends to steer the foreign 
exchange market toward stable exchange rates. 
  Our correspondent reports that Central Bank Governor 'Adeli 
said: Goods importers are the main applicants for foreign 
currency. 
  He referred to the shock prices on international oil markets 
in recent months and its effect in creating an imbalance in the 
country's balance of trade. He said: Using the two levers of 
foreign exchange and foreign trade policies, particularly in the 
import of goods, in the short term, to restore balance to 
foreign payments is unavoidable. 
  He emphasised the beneficial effects of those policies in 
the 
long run to stabilize exchange rates. He said stabilizing the 
exchange rate is the government's strongest action in protecting 
domestic products.

  [Text] The prime minister has asked the nonresident 
Indians, NRIs, to play their legitimate role in the speedy 
development of the country. Addressing a large gathering of 
NRIs in New York, Mr. Narasimha Rao asked them to evaluate for 
themselves the reform process without attaching any emotions. 
He emphatically stated that the economic changes underway in 
India are irreversible. The prime minister invited them to take 
advantage of the opportunities and invest in the country to help 
expand and strengthen the economic liberalization process. He 
said that structural hurdles posed at the initial stages have 
been overcome and there is a turnaround now. The prime minister 
appreciated the good work being carried out by the NRIs in 
various walks of life outside the country. 
  Our correspondent Rama Rao, covering the prime minister's 
visit, reports from New York that Mr. Narasimha Rao will be 
meeting the captains of industry at Houston today in the second 
leg of his visit to the United States. He described the visit 
as a step towards a strong, friendly, and cordial cooperation 
between the two great democracies of the world. During his 
one-day stay in Houston, the prime minister will be meeting the 
chief executive officers and presidents of the major companies 
under the auspices of the Greater Houston Partnership. The 
partnership brings together over 2,000 companies based in the 
city. The mayor of Houston will be presenting the keys of the 
city to Mr. Narasimha Rao. The prime minister will attend an 
Indian community reception before leaving for Boston tomorrow. 
  Our special correspondent Bhupal Inder Saini reports from 
Washington: 
  [Begin Saini recording] One of the primary objectives of the 
prime minister's goodwill visit to the United States is to 
explore the potentials and opportunities of stepping up 
Indo-American cooperation in the economic sphere. The United 
States is already India's largest trading partner and the 
economic reforms undertaken by New Delhi under Mr. Narasimha 
Rao's leadership had created tremendous opportunities for 
further stepping up economic links and trade. Significantly, a 
large number of leading Indian businessmen are also in the 
United States to tap the potential for tie-ups with American 
companies.

  [Text] Top U.S. business executives have offered to make 
big investments in India. The rich Indian-American community 
has also indicated plans to provide their expertise and money 
for giving a push to the market friendly reform process. At 
their separate meetings with the prime minister, now on an 
official tour of the United States, both American companies and 
the NRIs [nonresident Indians] appreciated the economic 
liberalization policy and said it has transformed India into a 
prospective market for greater inflow of funds. Mr. Narasimha 
Rao assured them that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board 
will look into any irritants in materializing their projects. 
  Our correspondent Rama Rao covering the prime minister's 
visit reports that the NRI plans include investments in highway 
construction and communications, as also mobilization of at 
least $2 billion every year. Mr. Narasimha Rao told the NRIs 
that they can play their legitimate role in the 
industrialization of the country and their investments have to 
increase as they go along. 
  Addressing a large section of the Indian-American community 
in New York, the prime minister said India means business and 
the future course is clear. His current visit is to project the 
giant leap the country is poised to take in industrial 
development and to give a personal undertaking over the 
irreversibility of the changed course. Mr. Rao asked the NRIs 
to participate in the present efforts based on their sound 
economic judgment. Commending the NRIs for the good work done 
in the country where they are living, he said they should keep 
it up. About Indo-U.S. ties, the prime minister said these need 
to be strong and friendly, not only for mutual benefit but for 
the future of mankind as a whole. The importance of his visit, 
he said, goes beyond the scope of normal bilateral relations. 
  The prime minister has since arrived in Houston on the 
second 
leg of his American tour. Mr. Narasimha Rao is scheduled to 
meet the chief executives and presidents of major companies 
under the auspices of the Greater Houston Partnership. The 
partnership brings together over 2,000 companies based in the 
city. Later, the mayor of Houston will be presenting the keys 
of the city to Mr. Narasimha Rao. He will also attend a 
reception by the Indian community before leaving for Boston 
tomorrow.

  [Excerpt] Top American companies have evinced interest in 
investing in the Indian infrastructural sector. At the 
roundtable meeting with the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, in Houston the chief executives of several companies 
expressed an upbeat mood to invest in India. Over 100 chief 
executive officers of major companies attended the meeting. The 
prime minister outlined the salient features of the economic 
reforms and invited American businessmen to become partners for 
further mutual benefit. 
  Our correspondent Rama Rao accompanying the prime minister 
reports that for the first time since the launching of economic 
reforms, the foreign investors focussed attention on specific 
pattern of their projects. In another significant change, the 
investors themselves have analyzed the relative advantages of 
various markets in South Asia and have ranked India well above 
others. Our correspondent further states that the new projects 
outlined at the meeting include the setting up of a commercial 
bank, mining and exploitation of bauxite in Andhra Pradesh and 
Orissa, and a computer company. 
  A heavy schedule awaits the prime minister when he arrives 
in 
Washington DC tonight on the last leg of his week-long visit to 
the United States. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister has arrived in Washington for 
wide-ranging talks with President Clinton. During his stay in 
the U.S. capital, Mr. Narasimha Rao will meet the decision 
makers and exchange views on bilateral and international 
matters. He will address the joint meeting of the U.S. Congress 
today. The Rao-Clinton talks tomorrow are expected to break new 
ground in bilateral relations. This will be their first meeting 
and also the first high-level contact between the two countries 
since the end of the cold war. Expansion of economic 
cooperation and better appreciation of each other's stand on 
issues like nuclear nonproliferation are likely to be the focus. 
Indian officials say that the Clinton Administration wanted the 
summit meeting to cover the situation in Russia, the role of the 
United Nations in peacekeeping, and the Nonaligned Movement. 
  Shortly before leaving for Washington, Mr. Narasimha Rao 
said 
in Boston that an important purpose of his current visit is to 
invite America to join the Indian efforts for speedy 
industrialization and infrastructure development. Delivering 
the (Joe Deddy) memorial lecture at the Harvard University, the 
prime minister said true North-South cooperation demands 
collaboration between the developed countries which have a huge 
research and development base and the developing countries. He 
also called for development of new technologies that can result 
in creation of maximum number of jobs at minimum cost. The (Joe 
Deddy) memorial lecture established in 1955 is for the promotion 
of tolerance, understanding, and goodwill among the nations, 
particularly the East and the West. Rajiv Gandhi and V.S. 
Naipaul were the prominent personalities who delivered the 
lecture in the past. The prime minister spoke at length about 
the Indian scene and the economic reform process. He said 
globalization of economies should be on the basis of partnership 
and should be a smooth affair. Amid lusty cheers from the 
audience, Mr. Rao declared that despite occasional clashes and 
agitations India will remain united with its unmatched 
attractions. 
  The former U.S. ambassador to India and noted economist, 
Professor Galbraith, introducing the prime minister to the 1,000 
strong student audience said India is America's most enduring 
friend. Prof. Galbraith said the bilateral relations are deep 
rooted and the so-called concerns belong to the realm of 
bureaucrats.

Inder Saini] 
  [Text] The prime minister is today launching upon two days 
of intensive interaction with decision makers in the United 
States -- both in the political and economic spheres. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao will first of all address the joint meeting of 
both houses of the U.S. Congress today. He will be the first 
prime minister of any country to get the opportunity since Mr. 
Clinton took over as U.S. president. Mr. Narasimha Rao is 
expected to utilize it to spell out India's views on the 
emerging world scenario -- both in the political and economic 
fields as well as regional and bilateral issues. 
  Significantly, the prime minister's address to the Congress 
became possible after several American senators as well members 
of the House of Representatives expressed their wish to hear in 
person the prime minister of the largest democracy in the world. 
It was not on the original schedule earlier. Mr. Narasimha Rao 
will have his first meeting with President Clinton tomorrow, 
when they have talks at the White House. After having lunch 
together, the two leaders will address a joint news conference. 
An atmosphere conducive to an open and frank Indo-U.S. dialogue 
has been created with both sides making clear their views on 
major world and regional issues. There is a large area of 
agreement though there are differences in perspective on some 
issues. Both sides recognized that there is need to make the 
world a secure place free from a threat of major conflagration. 
There is need for disarmament, especially in the nuclear field. 
  India has made it clear that it is prepared to discuss the 
question of disarmament, including nuclear nonproliferation, but 
real world security can be established in a comprehensive 
nondiscriminatory framework only. The Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty -- NPT -- is unacceptable to India in its present form as 
it is discriminatory and seeks to divide the world permanently 
into two categories -- the nuclear haves and havenots. The 
Clinton Administration, which was earlier pressing for a 
regional NPT for South Asia has now shown understanding of 
India's viewpoint that such an arrangement cannot work. Nuclear 
weapons cannot be banished from the region just by two countries 
signing the NPT or a regional variation. 
  Another major focus of Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit is on 
strengthening Indo-American business ties. A large number of 
top Indian industrialists and business people are now in 
Washington having talks with their American counterparts on 
joint ventures and tie-ups. The finance minister, Dr. Manmohan 
Singh, is also in the American capital to clear any doubts about 
the far-reaching character of India's economic reforms. The 
United States is already India's largest trading partner. But a 
full potential for greater economic cooperation is yet to be 
tapped. Hopefully, the interaction during Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
visit will lead to increased trade and economic cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Satish: "U.S. South Asia Policy: Bound To </F>
Fail"] 
  [Text] The Clinton administration's new concept of a 
multilateral arrangement on nuclear non-proliferation in South 
Asia is unlikely to succeed. There are only two possibilities: 
either India changes its stance or it does not. The dialogue is 
obviously doomed to failure if India does not budge from its 
consistent stand that it would not accept any regional 
non-proliferation treaty and would only be party to a regime of 
nuclear non-proliferation, which is both non-discriminatory and 
universal in character. But would such an arrangement succeed 
if India bowed to international pressure and accepted some form 
of regional restraint? 
  Before considering why it would not the new US approach 
mooted at the London talks recently needs to be put in 
perspective. It has been evolved out of the special report on 
South Asia that US President Mr Bill Clinton presented to the US 
Congress on April 29 last year. The report virtually indicated 
the abandoning of the earlier proposal made by former Pakistan 
prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, and tacitly backed by the US, 
wherein India and Pakistan would have signed a regional 
non-proliferation treaty, with the US, China and Russia being 
guarantors. India's objection then had been that China's 
presence as a guarantor was unacceptable because that country 
posed a security concern to India. 
  The most significant aspect that stood out in the report 
(and 
reflected in the new proposal) was a tacit acceptance of the 
Indian position that any durable solution to the nuclear 
imbroglio in the subcontinent would necessarily have to 
effectively address its concerns both over China's nuclear 
potential and the newly-developing nuclear uncertainty in the 
Central Asian Republics following the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union. 
  The US objectives, under the new approach, on the nuclear 
issue in the region are: first to cap, then over time reduce 
and finally eliminate the possession of weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery. 
  A unilateral or regional cut-off of fissile material 
production. 
  A regional agreement not to conduct nuclear detonations and 
placing safeguards on new and existing nuclear facilities. 
  Since President Clinton believes that the whole issue is a 
regional problem, it is worthwhile to consider what factors 
would influence or come in the way of a regional solution, 
especially in the context of his suggestion that while "each 
region is different, both countries can benefit from the ideas 
and experience that we have gained over the decade in arms 
control and CSBMs (confidence and security building measures) in 
discussions with the Soviet Union and others." 
  It is clear that the dialogue that the US is proposing is 
basically a replication of earlier arms control treaties that it 
had negotiated with the erstwhile USSR. However, there is one 
major problem in trying to apply the same to South Asia. Major 
breakthroughs in arms reduction talks between the two 
superpowers have always come along with significant thaws in 
political relations between them. 
  That is not the case between India and Pakistan. The mutual 
mistrust between the two since 1947 has shown no signs of 
improving and, if anything, the relationship is at its lowest 
ebb now. Due to the perverse logic of partition Pakistan's 
raison d'etre of being an Islamic state would, by extension, 
succeed only if India's secular experiment is seen to fail. 
This, added to the division of Pakistan in 1971 (the creation 
of Bangladesh) and the peculiar sub- continental social 
realities have only added to the growth of a disease of which 
Kashmir at symptom. 
  Therefore, a solution to the Kashmir issue would be central 
to a more basic thaw in bilateral relations and to the success 
of any future CSBMs on nuclear non-proliferation that may be 
agreed to. The US approach appears to be that an agreement on 
nuclear non-proliferation and CSBMs would reduce political 
tensions and lead to a solution on Kashmir (it may be recalled 
that the US is now talking of a "deep freeze" on Kashmir and 
concentrating on non- proliferation). The ground reality is 
precisely the opposite. A durable regional agreement on 
non-proliferation is possible only when the more fundamental 
issue of Kashmir is first satisfactorily resolved. 
  And for that to happen, the geo-strategic realities of the 
sub-continent at the moment warrant that a solution would 
necessarily have to take into account the strategic importance 
of J&amp;K to China and other neighbouring countries. 
  It should be remembered that the state of Jammu and Kashmir 
shares a 350 km border with China's Xinkiang province. However, 
this area forms part of Pak-Occupied Kashmir (POK) and, -- 1963, 
Pakistan ceded the Raskam valley and the Taghdumbash Pamirs, 
north of the Karakoram mountains, to China. For China, 
therefore, the Xinkiang border from Siachen glacier to the 
occupied Aksai Chin area is with India, while further east it is 
with Pakistan. Since the area has immense strategic value to 
China, it has a vested interest in the solution (or lack of it) 
of the Kashmir dispute and cannot be considered as a 
disinterested party. China is very much an interested party in 
the Kashmir dispute by virtue of its holding Kashmir territory. 
  Other factors that need to be satisfactorily addressed 
before 
any regional non-proliferation agreement are India's security 
concerns vis-a-vis China arising out of its defeat in the 1962 
war, the consequent border dispute, the China-Pakistan military 
axis and China's own attempts at improving its strategic depth 
in the region. China's professed commitments to 
non-proliferation are taken here with a pinch of salt. A 
glaring example is that despite professing adherence to the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 1992, The New York 
Times of May 6 last year first revealed that there was evidence 
from satellite photos that China was still shipping M11 missiles 
to Pakistan. If China is violating the objectives of the MTCR, 
what is the guarantee that it would adhere to any commitment 
that would essentially mean a break in the China-Pakistan 
military axis? Despite the thaw in bilateral relations during 
the last few years, there are very few in India who believe that 
China is altogether trustworthy. 
  Many Indian military experts and politicians still believe 
that with China's ambitions of becoming a superpower and 
achieving a semblance of nuclear parity with both the US and 
Russia, the most effective Indian response to this cannot but be 
to go about setting up a nuclear deterrent force and perfecting 
delivery systems to have the capability to hit back at important 
political, economic and military-industrial targets in China 
even after taking a first strike. 
  With such a volatile ground-level situation, the psyche of 
the people and politicians of the sub-continent is clearly not 
geared to adhering to any regional arms reduction or nuclear 
non-proliferation agreement while problems like Kashmir and 
terrorism continue to simmer. 
  In such a scenario--of passions running high over Kashmir, 
worsening Indo-Pak relations and China's overwhelming nuclear 
superiority vis-a-vis India--it would be unrealistic to have a 
workable regional non-proliferation a agreement, until the more 
fundamental issues facing the three countries are first 
satisfactorily dealt with.

<F P=106> [Commentary by All India Radio special correspondent B.I. </F>
Saini] 
  [Text] The United States pushing for India signing the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on agreeing to a regional 
variant has for long been an irritant in the growth of relations 
between the two countries. [sentence as heard] The American 
attitude has been that full scope safeguards in the subcontinent 
are necessary to ensure that tensions between India and Pakistan 
do not erupt into war with the possibility of a nuclear 
exchange. The American policy failed to recognize three vital 
elements of the situation in South Asia. 
  If India had wanted to develop nuclear weapons capability, 
it 
would have done so right after the peaceful test at Pokhran in 
1974. Secondly, Pakistan has been clandestinely developing 
nuclear weapons capability even when claiming that it does not 
have any nuclear bombs. Another crucial aspect ignored or not 
given due weight by the American policymakers was that India's 
security concerns were not confined to the threat from Pakistan 
alone. 
  The Clinton Administration's latest report to the U.S. 
Congress on progress toward regional nonproliferation in South 
Asia, which came just on the eve of the prime minister's visit, 
is in a way a step forward from earlier reports. It recognizes 
that while dealing with weapons proliferation in South Asia, the 
United States and others have to take into account regional 
security threat perceptions, including those extending beyond 
India and Pakistan. The report indicates adoption of a more 
realistic attitude by the United States toward the objectives of 
stopping the proliferation of nuclear and other mass destruction 
weapons in South Asia. But, so far as the question of supply of 
more weapons and equipment like F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan is 
concerned, the United States is still sticking to its earlier 
plan to give these aircraft to Islamabad in return for capping 
of Pakistan's nuclear program. It fails to recognize that 
supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan is only going to trigger off 
an arms race in the subcontinent. So far as India is concerned, 
it has made abundantly clear in the past that it will not sign 
the NPT, as it is discriminatory. It seeks to divide the world 
into nuclear haves and have-nots. The Clinton Administration 
report indicates that there is scope for India and the United 
States discussing the NPT issue further so that differences in 
their perceptions can be narrowed down. In any case, the 
Narasimaha Rao-Clinton talks on Thursday will enable the two 
leaders to see each other's viewpoint more clearly.

<F P=106> [Commentary by All India Radio correspondent M. Rama Rao] </F>
  [Text] If Davos had set the stage three years ago for 
projecting India as a new destination for investment, Houston, 
the number two city for business in the United States, has taken 
the campaign into the drawing rooms of the multinational chief 
executives. This is evident from the response at the round 
table session organized in honor of the prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, by the Greater Houston Partnership, an umbrella 
trade body of over 2,600 U.S. companies. 
  The other indicators of improving India's (?option) are 
numerous requests for a meeting with Mr. Narasimha Rao soon 
after he landed in New York. The questions to him and the 
finance minister reflect the upbeat mood among the U.S. business 
and financial companies which are trying to diversify into the 
Asia-Pacific and the Southeast Asia region. They find the 
Indian Government's liberalization program and incentives quite 
attractive for investment. They now consider India as number 
one for new investments. The Indian side once again tried to 
project the infrastructural sector as a priority area. 
  Houston is called the energy capital of the world with 
industries dealing with power, hydrocarbons, electronics, 
computers, medicines, and food processing. One power and oil 
major has already entered the Indian scene and some others are 
on the way. The power company's chief executive, Mr. Kenneth 
Lay, says his Indian experience proves to the world the old 
maxim that investments are also a matter of good faith. The 
statement made apparently in good faith as his company was the 
first to enter the untested waters when the power sector was 
thrown open. Computer-related materials, aluminum production, 
technology transfer projects relating to rail transportation, 
information and health are among the areas that may be resulting 
in a lot of investment activities in the wake of the prime 
minister's visit to Houston. For a change, the business 
community also seems to be equally concerned about the poor and 
is anxious to join our efforts in poverty alleviation programs.

investment has been approved since August 1991. Over 80 
percent of the investment went to priority industries with fuel 
and oil refinery sector accounting for a maximum of 2,395 crore 
rupees, followed by the power sector, food processing, 
metallurgical industries and electrical equipment and 
electronics. The actual inflow of foreign investment including 
NRI [nonresident Indian] investment amounted to 3,406 crore 
rupees. The maximum investment worth 650 crore rupees was from 
the United States followed by Britain and Germany.

  [Text] The Government has thrown open the basic telecom 
services for the private sector shedding its long-held monopoly. 
  It would also have `suitable arrangements' (preferably a 
regulatory authority) to implement the policy allowing the 
private sector into the basic services. The much-awaited 
national telecom policy was announced in both Houses of 
Parliament today. 
  The Government, however, did not intend to change the 
present 
part departmental, part corporation structure of the telecom 
sector. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Mahanagar 
Telecommunications Ltd (MTNL) would be allowed to remain in the 
present form along with the private sector entities in providing 
the basic telephone service, in voice, data and other 
connections. 
  The announcement heralding a new era in the telecom sector 
was made by the Minister of State for Communications, Mr. Sukh 
Ram, after the Union Cabinet cleared the policy at its meeting 
earlier in the day. The minister later addressed a press 
conference giving details of the policy. 
  `With a view to supplementing the effort of the DoT in 
providing telecommunications services to the people, companies 
registered in India will be allowed to participate in the area 
of basic telephone services also', the new policy said. Various 
international telecom companies had already put in proposals 
worth $3 billion offering to run telephone services in various 
parts of the country. The new policy clears the hurdles in 
their joining the Indian network. 
  Mr. Sukh Ram announced at the press conference that the 
Government would fix the telecom tariff and a decision on the 
regulatory body to ensure competition and interface problems 
would be taken at a later date. He felt that India had one of 
the lowest telephone tariffs and he wanted that status to be 
maintained. Mr Sukh Ram noted that the 0.8 per cent telephone 
density was much below the world average of 10 per cent. 
  The new policy also announced revised targets for the 
telecom 
sector for the Eighth Plan and noted that additional resources 
required to achieve the revised targets would be well over Rs. 
23,000 crores. `Private investment and association of the 
private sector would be needed in a big way to bridge the 
resource gap,' the policy said. It went on to add that private 
initiative would be used to complement the departmental efforts 
to raise additional resources both through increased internal 
generation and adopting innovative means like leasing, deferred 
payments, build-operate-transfer (BOT), build-lease-transfer 
(BLT), build-transfer-operate (BTO) etc. 
  About the private participation, the policy noted that 
`these 
companies will be required to maintain a balance in their 
coverage between urban and rural areas. Their conditions of 
operation will include agreed tariff and revenue sharing 
agreements. Other terms applicable to such companies will be 
similar to those indicated for value added services'. 
  `In order to implement the above policy, suitable 
arrangements will have to be made to (a) protect and promote the 
interests of the consumers and (b) ensure fair competition,' the 
policy said indicating the formation of a regulatory authority. 
  Introduction to the policy document said the telecom 
services 
of world class quality are necessary for the success of the new 
economic policy. 
  To achieve the new policy objectives the Government also 
announced the revised targets for the Eighth Plan. According to 
the new targets, telephone should be made available on demand by 
1997. All villages should be covered by 1997. In the urban 
areas a PCO [public call office] should be provided for every 
500 persons by 1997. All value-added services available 
internationally should be introduced in India to raise the 
telecom services to international standards, preferably by 1996. 
  Even with the comparatively modest targets of the Eighth 
Plan, as originally fixed, there is a resource gap of Rs. 7,500 
crores. The additional resources required to achieve the 
revised targets would be over Rs. 23,000 crores. `Clearly, this 
is beyond the capacity of Government funding and internal 
generation of resources,' the policy said. 
  About the value added services, the policy pointed out that 
apart from continuing with the tendering system, the track 
record of the company, compatibility of the company, usefulness 
of the technology being offered for future development, 
protection of national security interests, ability to give the 
best quality of service to the consumer at the most competitive 
cost and attractiveness of the commercial terms to the DoT would 
also be criteria for selection to award licence. 
  The policy also encourages introduction of new technologies. 
`Pilot projects will be encouraged directly by the Government in 
order to access new technologies, new systems in basic as well 
as value added services'. The policy emphasises the need for 
administration of the telecom sector in such a way that the 
inflow of technology is made easy and India does not lag behind 
in getting full advantage of the emerging new technologies.

  [Text] Damascus, May 18 (AFP) -- Syria and Israel are still 
far apart over moves towards peace after US Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's latest Middle East mission, Syrian 
presidential spokesman Jubran Kuriyah said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  "The results of Mr. Christopher's talks in Israel show that 
there are still wide differences because of the Israeli position 
on the principles of peace," he said. 
  Christopher left for Egypt on Wednesday after a second round 
of talks with President Hafiz al-Asad, when he briefed the 
Syrian leader on his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
Israel has offered a withdrawal from the strategic Golan heights 
over several years in return for total peace, but the Syrian 
official press on Wednesday rejected any phased handover. The 
Golan has been the main stumbling block between Israel and Syria 
since the launch of Middle East peace talks in October 1991. 
  Negotiations between Syria and Israel have been suspended 
since the Hebron massacre on February 25 when a Jewish settler 
killed 30 Arab worshipers.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and his 
accompanying delegation left Damascus at 1615 yesterday. He was 
seen off at Damascus International Airport by Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar', the Syrian ambassador in Washington, and the 
U.S. ambassador in Damascus. 
  The U.S. secretary of state arrived in Cairo yesterday, 
Wednesday, evening. He met with Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak. Christopher said he believes that Syria is serious 
about Middle East peace. 
  Following his meeting with President Mubarak, Christopher 
told reporters that the negotiations are facing a long road, and 
that the issues are remarkably difficult. 
  In press statements on his arrival in Cairo, Christopher 
said 
he held good and constructive talks with officials in Syria and 
Israel. He explained that during his meetings several proposals 
were discussed. These proposals concern achieving a 
breakthrough in the peace process on the Syrian track. 
Christopher expressed optimism despite the existence of some 
difficult topics that need further talks with both sides. He 
said he naturally found points of convergence and difference. 
However, we will continue the rounds of talks to reach a 
solution and achieve a breakthrough on all tracks, he added.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Facts of the Peace Process 
Anew," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: During his reception of the 
U.S. secretary of state yesterday, leader al-Asad reemphasized 
several facts concerning Syria's position on the peace process. 
These facts are among the bases on which the Middle East peace 
process was established when Syria accepted this process and 
gave an opportunity for its launching through the Madrid 
conference. 
  AL-BA'TH explains that among these facts is Syria's care for 
continuing the peace process and its appreciation of the U.S. 
efforts designed to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. The paper asserts that achieving 
this objective is linked to the commitment to the bases and 
principles on which the peace process was established. This 
process emanates from the resolutions of both the United Nations 
and international legitimacy, led by the commitment to the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  The paper holds Israel responsible for the stumbling 
bilateral negotiations. Israel has not ceased its attempts to 
circumvent the peace process, the paper says. These Israeli 
positions prove to everyone that Israel's acceptance of the 
peace initiative was formal in the first place. This acceptance 
also conceals intentions that reject a just solution. 
  The paper points out that Israel always seeks to depart from 
the bases and substance of the peace process, and to shirk the 
commitment to the initiative which was accepted on the Arab, 
regional, and international levels. This was confirmed 
yesterday through the [Israeli] replies Christopher carried to 
Damascus. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel is the only party that is 
undermining the peace initiative and threatening regional 
stability through intransigent positions and dictates that are 
not in harmony with the substance of the peace process. 
  Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH wonders: To what extent can 
Israel continue its refusal to respond to both the international 
community and the cosponsors of the peace conference? The near 
future, however, may answer this question. 
  Under the headline "Israel Is Undermining the Peace 
Efforts," 
the newspaper TISHRIN says: After he was briefed on the outcome 
of Christopher's talks in Israel, President Hafiz al-Asad 
explained that differences between the Syrian and Israeli 
positions are wide and great because the Israeli side departed 
from the bases and requirements of the peace process. 
  Discussing the Israeli positions based on intransigence and 
procrastination, the paper adds: The rulers of Israel have 
foiled all efforts designed to remove the peace talks from their 
deadlock. The paper explains that Syria worked for a real and 
substantial launching of the peace process, and also supported 
the U.S. Administration's efforts designed to place the peace 
process on the right path. 
  TISHRIN continues: In brief, the Rabin government wants to 
annex the territories. Thus, this government's talk about peace 
is no more than a cheap maneuver designed to mislead world 
public opinion and create a false optimism that the peace 
process is achieving progress. The paper notes that Syria 
absolutely believes in peace and that it continues to make every 
possible effort to promote the peace process. The paper 
emphasizes that Syria adheres to regaining the entire Golan and 
other occupied territories and to Israel's withdrawal to the 4 
June 1967 borders. It is not a Syrian tradition to sell out an 
iota of national soil or any Arab right. This is because peace 
should be just and comprehensive. 
  TISHRIN points out that the proposed Israeli settlements are 
actually a consecration of occupation and an open disregard of 
both the Security Council resolutions and the international 
community's principles and charters. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace can be achieved by resorting 
to the international law and not by entrenching and spreading 
the law of the jungle. The rulers of Israel should realize that 
all their alleged peace plans would fail because Syria is the 
Arabs' conscience and also because the Arabs will only accept 
what Syria accepts. 
  Under the headline "Complete Withdrawal First," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: At a time when Syria showed full 
cooperation with both the U.S. initiative and efforts designed 
to promote the peace process in implementation of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, Israel showed much 
disregard of international principles, UN charters, and the 
legitimacy of the relevant UN resolutions rejecting the Israeli 
occupation. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Despite the apparent future difficulties 
and traps facing the Cairo agreement and obstructing its 
implementation, it seems Israel has not yet learned the lesson 
that lame peace settlements cannot make a durable peace, that 
peace does not mean there is a winner or a loser, and that peace 
does not imply concluding cheap deals based on bargains. 
  The paper says all observers have no difficulty in 
discovering that the real Israeli position is pushing the peace 
process toward numerous bargains, now that Israel has placed 
obstacles and demonstrated intransigence about this process. 
The paper explains that there is a great difference between 
someone who wants a complete, just, and comprehensive peace, and 
someone who wants to tamper with the components of such a peace, 
ridicules the resolutions of international legitimacy, and 
discounts the international will on the other. 
  The paper adds: Christopher's regional tour has shown that 
differences [between Syria and Israel] are still wide because 
the Israeli position departs from the bases and requirements of 
the peace process launched in Madrid. 
  AL-THAWRAH points out that Syria cares for the continuation 
of the peace process. As President Hafiz al-Asad asserted, the 
objective is to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in 
accordance with both the international resolutions and the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH notes: As President al-Asad said, 
Syria adheres to the pillars of the peace process, which is 
based on the Security Council resolutions. These resolutions 
stipulate full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders in 
order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
Thus, complete Israeli withdrawal is the first and foremost 
priority under all circumstances.

<F P=106> [From "Letters to the Editor"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Chief Editor: 
  Greetings, 
  With reference to the report published yesterday on the 
formation of a new Government in Syria under "Major General" 
Hikmat al-Shihabi, I would like to clarify the following: 
  First: The report was datelined ""Damascus, AL-DUSTUR" which 
suggests that I was its source. This is untrue. I had nothing 
to do with that report. 
  Second: It seems that the report did not originate from 
Damascus in the first place. The chief of staff in Syria holds 
the rank of a "lieutenant general" and not a "major general," as 
mentioned in the report. This makes one conclude that the 
author of the report is very far from understanding Syrian 
affairs. 
  Third: Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi is widely 
respected among all Syrian and non-Syrian circles. I find it 
inappropriate to mention his name just like that whenever one 
wants to talk about the a government formation. 
  Fourth: There is nothing in Syrian political circles to 
suggest any potential reshuffle in the current Syrian 
Government, which is headed by Engineer Mahmud al-Zu'bi, 
especially since it recorded several achievements which cannot 
be mentioned here. 
  Sixth [as published]: The concerned circles in Damascus have 
not commented on this report. Nor have they reacted to similar 
reports published in the past. 
  I will be grateful if you publish this clarification. With 
my best regards. 
  [Signed] 'Ali Jamalu, AL-DUSTUR correspondent in Damascus

  [Excerpt] Damascus--Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has praised President Hafiz al-Asad's 
patriotic and pan-Arab stands toward Arab causes, his defense of 
Arab legitimate rights, and his adherence to the just and 
comprehensive peace march. In a statement to SANA upon his 
departure to Cairo today, accompanied by the Arab League 
delegation, he said: I have had the honor to meet with President 
Hafiz al-Asad during my visit to Damascus to attend the 26th 
round of the Joint Arab Action Higher Coordination Committee. I 
briefed the president on the positive results of the committee's 
meetings in terms of strengthening cooperation and joint Arab 
action. 
  'Abd-al-Majid said: It was a good opportunity to hear the 
president's directives and opinions on the various Arab issues, 
particularly the Yemeni situation. The meeting was also a good 
opportunity to hear the president's views in this regard and to 
express my appreciation for the president's intensive efforts 
and endeavors in defending legitimate Arab rights and adhering 
to the just and comprehensive peace march in accordance with 
international legitimacy, the UN Security Council resolutions, 
and the land-for- peace principle. 
  Alluding to the results of the Arab League's Higher 
Coordination Committee meetings over which he presided, 
'Abd-al-Majid said: They were fruitful. Recommendations and 
resolutions were reached connected with all issues on the 
agenda. The results were positive and effective in terms of 
strengthening the march of joint Arab action in all domains at 
the present stage. [passage omitted].

  [Text] Today the Islamic nation is celebrating Jerusalem 
Day according the Jerusalem Committee's resolution, issued at 
its meeting in Fez on 19-20 April 1984 under the chairmanship of 
His Majesty King Hassan II, God make him victorious, the 
chairman of the Committee. 
  Today is an occasion for more than 1 billion Muslims 
throughout the world to renew their insistence on the Arabic 
character of this holy city, despite the Zionist practices to 
obliterate its Arab and Islamic features. 
  King Hassan II, the chairman of Jerusalem Committee, had 
emphasized during one the Committee's sessions that we should 
use all our human and material strength and potential to up hold 
the word of right and to persuade those who know and those who 
do not or who are pretending not to know that our rights should 
be returned as soon as possible. 
  This gracious royal invitation to return the right to its 
legitimate owners reflects the effort made and being made to 
support the issues of Islam and the Muslims. 
  While commemoration of Jerusalem Day is coinciding this year 
with the peace process in the Middle East, and especially in the 
land of Palestine where the Palestinian authority has assumed 
its duties in the self-rule areas, what has been achieved 
represents only one step of many that are required to be made on 
the path of achieving a just and comprehensive peace. 
  No doubt Jerusalem will remain the core issue in any 
settlement in the area, and the question of recovering it will 
remain a joint nationalist and Islamic preoccupation. It will 
remain the objective toward which the Palestinian, Arab, and 
Muslim generations will aspire.

accept the clarifications of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat that he 
was referring to a peaceful jihad during his controversial 
address at a mosque in Johannesburg earlier this month. Rabin 
says 'Arafat's explanation is far-fetched. Rabin says the 
episode is making the process with the Palestinians more 
difficult and will continue to do so in the future.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Text] Israel demands that the agreement signed recently 
by the PLO and the UNDP [UN Development Program] be amended, 
seeing that Faruq Qaddumi signed it with the title "foreign 
minister of Palestine." As it was signed, the agreement gives 
the PLO a status in the entire West Bank, and not just in 
Jericho. 
  The UNDP, which specializes in extending aid to developing 
countries, has been operating in the territories for many years 
in coordination with Israel financing economic and agricultural 
development programs. The establishment of self-rule in Gaza 
and Jericho required a change in the UNDP's status in the 
Palestinian Authority areas. The Gaza-Jericho agreement 
stipulates that the PLO may sign agreements concerning 
development programs and economic aid to the Palestinians with 
countries and international organizations on behalf of the 
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The Israeli UN delegation came across the PLO-UNDP agreement 
last week and reported it to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Israel lodged a harsh protest 
with the UNDP over the agreement, which contrary to what had 
been promised, was not coordinated with it. Israel argued that 
the agreement contravenes the Israeli-PLO accords, that 
Qaddumi's title of foreign minister of Palestine contravenes UN 
resolutions, and that it transpires from the agreement that the 
PLO is the source of authority in all the territories and not 
just in Gaza and Jericho. 
  At the same time, Israel asked the United States to help it 
pressure the UN not to pass a resolution ratifying the agreement 
and to prevent a precedent which could be emulated in other 
agreements between the PLO and international organizations. UN 
officials sent a message to Israel apologizing for the error, 
noting that they had gave in to PLO pressure to sign the draft 
agreement, and asserting that the UN will send a letter to the 
PLO informing it that there has been no "recognition" of 
Qaddumi's status as foreign minister and that the agreement will 
only apply to Gaza and Jericho. 
  Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that the 
Palestinians have been trying to sneak "symbols of sovereignty" 
into Gaza and Jericho. For example, contrary to what had been 
agreed upon, the word "national" appears on the badges worn by 
Palestinian policemen on their sleeves and a sign bearing the 
inscription "The Palestine Police" was hung on the police 
building in Gaza. The assessment in internal consultations held 
by the Foreign Ministry is that the Palestinians will attempt to 
use the offices of the donor countries in Jericho to maintain 
external relations with them. 
  The Gaza-Jericho agreement bans the Palestinian Authority 
from maintaining external relations or opening embassies in its 
territory or in other countries.

  [Text] Lebanon today received an official invitation to 
participate in the fifth session of the multilateral talks

Russian ambassadors. U.S. Charge d'Affaires Vincent Battle did 
not attend the meeting. 
  A diplomatic source at the Bustrus Palace [Foreign Ministry

  [Text] New York, May 18, INA--Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq 
'Aziz now in New York condemned the attitude of the countries 
insisting on continuing the blockade against Iraq. He 
emphasised the aim behind their policy was harming the people of 
Iraq and depriving it of requisites of life. 
  Mr. 'Aziz also said, in an interview to the U.S. CNN 
screened 
last night, those who insist on maintaining the blockade on Iraq 
were badly harming the people of Iraq and its right to live 
normally. He stressed it was necessary for the big powers 
influencial in the Security Council to respect Iraq's right to 
independence and sovereignty. 
  Mr. Tariq 'Aziz had pointed out that in the Security Council 
there is an apparent majority recognising and admitting the 
distances Iraq had passed in implementing the international 
resolutions. And he accused the United States as the country 
inside the Security Council hindering the raising of the 
blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  The Iraqi deputy premier reviewed the negative impact on the 
people of Iraq owing to the obstinacy of some countries in 
maintaining the blockade and said children and women and elderly 
people were dying because of the severe shortage of medicine.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, May 19, IRNA -- Iran 
Wednesday [18 May] categorically denied allegations by an 
American newspaper on the dispatch of arms and ammunitions to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Iran's deputy permanent representative at 
the United Nations Gholam 'Ali Khoshrow made the remark in a 
letter to Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg, chairman of the Security 
Council committee established pursuant to Resolution 724 
concerning Yugoslavia. 
  The `WASHINGTON POST' in an article on May 13, 1994 made a 
baseless claim that an Iranian 747 Boeing airliner which landed 
at Zagreb Airport, carried 60 tons of explosives and other 
materials used in manufacturing ammuniton for Bosnian Muslims. 
Sardenberg, in separate letters had asked Iran and Croatia to 
comment on the allegations of `WASHINGTON POST'. 
  Khoshrow stressed Iran's commitment to comply with the 
decisions of the Security Council concerning the situation in 
former Yugoslavia including Resolution 713. "The plane referred 
to in the said article was involved in the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance in continuation of the policy of the 
Iranian Government to provide humanitarian assistance to Bosnia 
and Herzegovina," he said. 
  Khoshrow reminded the chairman that upon the publication of 
the WASHINGTON POST's article, the Iranian Embassy in Zagreb 
officially denied the allegations and stated that the plane in 
question carried only humanitarian assistance.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] The Zionists have perpetrated another catastrophe by 
attacking the worshippers in the Bab al-Zawiyah mosque in 
al-Khalil and killing 20 of them. Observers say this Zionist 
action is the biggest attack on the Muslims since the killing of 
worshippers in the al-Khalil mosque. 
  The attack on the worshippers in Bab al-Zawiyah took place 
when nearly 160 political observers were stationed in al-Khalil 
to safeguard peace. This attack in the presence of 
international observers exposes the reality that the Zionists 
have no respect for international observers and, in view of 
their racist characteristics, they capitalize on every 
opportunity to suppress the Muslims. 
  This attack on worshippers in the Bab al-Zawiyah mosque took 
place when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in 
Tel Aviv within his Middle East tour and a visit to Jericho was 
on his agenda. The objective of the U.S. secretary's visit to 
Syria and Tel Aviv was to open the doors to negotiations between 
them. With his trip to Jericho, he sought to convey U.S. 
support for the compromising accord and for the progress of the 
talks. 
  With the U.S. secretary's visit to the region and the talks 
that took place, efforts were made to project the process of 
compromise as a means of ending the Middle East crisis. But the 
protest of the Muslims of the occupied territories and their 
suppression by the Zionist regime has proved that signed accords 
are of no use. Even though the accords are formulated by the 
compromising leaders and were implemented from on high with the 
support of foreign powers, the trend of the struggle continues 
through the masses of the people of occupied Palestine. As long 
as these protesting masses who are considered the true masters 
of Palestine do not achieve their dreams, accords will produce 
no results.

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has 
left New Delhi this morning for the United States. He was seen 
off at the airport by his cabinet colleagues, chief ministers of 
Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, the governor of 
Uttar Pradesh and senior officials. The seven-day visit will 
take Mr. Narasimha Rao to four cities, including the capital 
Washington and will enable him to meet a broad segment of the 
Clinton Administration, congressmen, and business circles. 
  Our correspondent, M. Rama Rao, covering the visit, says the 
main thrust of the prime minister's talks will be on enhanced 
economic and investment cooperation between the two countries. 
India will also reiterate its position on sensitive issues like 
Nuclear Nonproliferation, arms control, human rights, and 
Kashmir to the U.S. leaders. The Clinton-Rao talks slated for 
Thursday are expected to be open and frank, giving the leaders 
an opportunity to appreciate each other's point of view on world 
issues as also matters of mutual concern. 
  A high-level official delegation is accompanying the prime 
minister. It includes the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh; 
the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salaman 
Khurshid; and the minister of state in the prime minister's 
office, Mr. Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi. A 21-member trade delegation 
drawn from the three apex bodies of Indian industry is also 
accompanying the prime minister to help forge enhanced Indo-U.S. 
economic relations. The highlights of the visit include an 
address by Mr. Narasimha Rao to a joint meeting of the U.S. 
Congress and the lecture at the prestigious Harvard University.

  [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in the People's Palace at 1130 today. 
The meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and 
Dennis Ross, the U.S. Middle East peace coordinator. 
  Christopher conveyed to the president a message from U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in which he emphasizes the U.S. desire to 
continue its efforts to realize substantive progress in the 
peace process. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad expressed his appreciation for the 
U.S. efforts and stressed Syria's desire to continue the peace 
process to realize a just and comprehensive solution for the 
Arab-Israeli dispute in accordance with international 
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. Mr. Christopher 
briefed the president on the results of his talks in Israel 
which demonstrated that the differences are wide and great 
because of the large distance between the Israeli stand and the 
pillars of peace which were established at the Madrid 
conference. In this regard, the president reaffirmed Syria's 
stand and its adherence to the bases of the peace process based 
on UN Security Council resolutions which commit Israel to full 
withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders in order to realize just 
and comprehensive peace in the region.

  [Text] A number of foreign correspondents yesterday 
visited al-'Anad Base and viewed the fortifications and military 
equipment and vehicles captured by the forces of Constitutional 
legitimacy when they took control of the base the day before 
yesterday. 
  BBC radio correspondent (Simon Angerma), who visited the 
base, said in a report aired by the radio today that he saw some 
tanks of the forces of legitimacy deployed within the perimeter 
of the base. He also noted that the antiaircraft guns repulsed 
several air raids launched by aircraft of the forces of apostasy 
and secession over the area and forced them to flee. 
  The BBC correspondent added that a large number of the rebel 
troops withdrew from the base. He also said he saw the wreckage 
of a helicopter downed near the base entrance and the charred 
corpses of the two pilots.

by the feet of the soldiers of the oppressive al-Ahmar family. 
Greetings to our heroes of our Armed Forces of unity, democracy 
and national modernization which have shown such heroism in 
defeating and pursuing the (?defeated) remnants of the 
traitorous al-Ahmar family.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Ministry of Defense; place and date </F>
not given] 
  [Text] With the help of Almighty God, with the bravery of 
the heroes of the Armed Forces, and with the cohesion of all the 
sons of the people with them, the forces protecting the unity 
and Constitutional legitimacy are continuing to carry out their 
combat duties against the gangs of the forces of renegade, 
rebellion, and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party. Their 
wrong actions surrounded them and, therefore, they must be 
defeated and must bow to the people's will and their strike 
force on all axes and sectors. 
  On the Abyan-Aden axis, fighting is continuing in several 
directions, and the forces of renegade and secession are trying 
to send innocent people to certain death to merely gain time, 
show empty arrogance, and entertain themselves with destruction, 
after the units of the Armed Forces--the forces of unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy--tightened the siege [words 
indistinct] and are continuing to follow their targets with 
patience and accuracy, taking into account the circumstances in 
the fields of confrontation on this axis. All the feverish air 
and naval attacks have failed, and the forces of renegade and 
secession sustained double losses as a result of the lack of 
control of the collapsing and domineering [words indistinct], 
their dark and ominous fate. The brave men in the air defenses 
confronted the aircraft of the forces of renegade and secession 
and managed to down two aircraft, and the hostile attacks did 
not cause any losses. 
  On the Shabwah axis, the heroes in the units of the Armed 
Forces are continuing to carry out the duties assigned to them, 
and they made great progress in carrying out their missions 
after they managed to control the (?Sab) District as a result of 
the great cooperation by the brother citizens, who moved to 
shoulder their responsibility along with their forces--the 
forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces 
received [words indistinct] a complete battalion of the 
(?Hnayshan) Brigade, as well as the [word indistinct] forces in 
the (?Nisab) District [words indistinct], which declared their 
joining the forces of unity and constitutional forces, rejected 
the conspiracy of secession and the plan of renegade and 
rebellion, and condemned the sinful secessionist elements for 
what they did against the people, the homeland, and the Armed 
Forces and security. 
  On the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, the heroes in our Armed 
Forces are continuing their progress to carry out the remaining 
combat duties on that axis. In this sector, 22 missile bases 
were seized. The brave heroes in the brave Air Force continued 
to carry out the duties assigned to them with success and 
effectiveness. All aircraft returned safely to their bases. 
With the continued progress of the forces of unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy to confront the remaining forces of 
renegade and secession, out of concern about people's lives, and 
to avoid the continuation of the fighting, whose result is 
considered decided in favor of the forces of the people, the 
unity, and democracy, we renew our call on all officers, 
noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers, who are still under 
the control of the sinful secessionist forces to leave the 
positions of hostility and come to unity and the people and to 
join the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which is 
the place of every officer, noncommissioned officer, and soldier 
in the Armed Forces. They will find every understanding of 
their situation and the circumstances that forced them to be 
[words indistinct] under the banner of the Yemeni unity. 
  The fate of the forces of wrong, deviation, secession, 
partition, and destruction is known. [words indistinct]

every officer, noncommissioned officer, and soldier in the Armed 
Forces. They will find complete understanding of their 
situation and the circumstances that forced them to be in 
secessionist rebel ranks. They will get all the attention, 
care, and status they deserve under the banner of the glorious 
Republic of Yemen. 
  As for the forces of error and darkness, the forces of 
secession, fragmentation, and destruction, their fate is known 
because the wrath of justice will inevitably reach them. As God 
has said: And say: `Truth has now arrived, and falsehood 
perished: for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish.

<F P=106> [Military statement No. 22, issued by the Ministry of </F>
Defense; place and date not given] 
  [Text] For the 22d consecutive day our brave forces 
continued their heroic resistance [words indistinct] and with an 
unyielding and uncrushable will to the human shields and the 
barbaric war machine which the criminal gang of the al-Ahmar 
family has plunged toward the former [word indistinct] border 
regions. 
  The comeback actions which our defending forces have reached 
last night and today morning in the orientation of Karish, 
al-Dali and Abyan were characterized by the decisiveness and the 
[word indistinct] and strong defense on all fighting fronts. 
Meanwhile, the hostile forces continued their retreat and 
surrender. In Karish frontline more than 1,500 officers and 
soldiers from the forces which the gang of the al-Ahmar family 
has plunged in this direction surrendered themselves to our 
forces yesterday, on the one hand after their strength was 
exhausted and on the other after they discovered how false were 
the claims of legality which this treacherous and [word 
indistinct] gang gives a big-mouthed talk about it. 
  On another level, our hero citizens in Radfan District were 
able to destroy a number of tanks which tried to sneak toward 
al-Habilayn. With close struggle and coherence with the 
citizens and volunteers who came from various governorates, our 
brave forces continued chasing the remnants of the forces of the 
al-Ahmar family in all directions. 
  The Ministry of Defense, which feels [word indistinct] 
confident of the ability of our courageous Armed Forces, 
supported materially and morally by the masses of dignified 
people of inflicting defeat following defeat on the gang of 
treachery and treason, would like to affirm to the masses of our 
people and the Arab and world public opinion that there is not 
even a grain of truth in the allegations and claims fabricated 
by the information sections of the bloody gang of the al-Ahmar 
family, which the listeners were told about illusionary 
victories in this (?connotation). Our forces, which foiled all 
the attempts of the forces of the al-Ahmar family and stopped 
their attempts after inflicting (?total flight) to them, are 
also able of coming forward decisively and [word indistinct] and 
strong defense and inflicting decisive punishments on the 
adventurist aggressions anywhere.

  [Text] A military statement issued by the Ministry of 
Defense mentioned that the assassin 'Ali 'Abdullah Salih plunged 
the day before yesterday big numbers of barbaric forces and 
quantities of his miltiary equipment in a desperate attempt to 
break through the fortified defense lines of our Armed Forces, 
standing with the masses of our people against the freedom and 
dignity [as heard]. This was preceded by false statements, such 
as the statements of al- Ansi and al-Iryani. And in front of 
these barbarous forces, from the helpless they presented human 
shields to the cemetery of death. The statement mentioned that 
our Armed Forces have come forward against taking shelter by the 
fighters in the cities and villages and making the citizens from 
the sons of our people human shields facing the weapons of 
destruction and killing. 
  We, in the name of the Yemeni people in every place, demand 
the immediate stopping of this foolish fighting, and we remind 
all that we are in the month of war-prohibition in the Hijriyyah 
[Islamic] calendar, in which almighty God prohibited fighting in 
them. We are even in the first 10 days of the month of 
Dhu'l-hijjah. What law except the law of the jungle allows 
this, and where are those insisting on fighting from Islam. It 
is rejected teaching and in Shari'ah, we in the name of the 
Yemeni people appeal to all Arab and Islamic countries and 
organizations to stand with us in calling on the fighters to 
cease fire, especially during the days of pilgrimage and the 
blessed 'Id al-Adha.

  [Text] A military source has explained to the Yemeni News 
Agency, SABA' that in a desperate, hysterical, and cowardly 
attempt the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] fired a missile on Ta'izz at 2030 
yesterday, targetting defenseless citizens. But God's 
providence ordained that this missile fall on Sadr Mountain. 
  The source said no human losses were sustained, but that 
children, women, and elderly people in the city and the nearby 
villages were scared and there were some cracks in the houses of 
the citizens from the explosion of the missile.

  [Text] Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has affirmed 
that Aden will not fall to the northerners. In an exclusive 
telephone interview with MBC's Tawfiq Jazulit, al-Bid did not 
rule out the possibility of secession from the north, but he 
left the final decision up to the competent bodies in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] and the national forces. Jazulit's asked 
him: 
  [Begin recording] [Jazulit] Mr. Vice President, the YSP and 
the Yemeni oppositionists have set up a National Salvation 
Council instead of a national salvation government, as was 
previously suggested. What is the significance of setting up 
this council? 
  [Al-Bid] I believe that this is not the issue at the moment. 
The issue we are dealing with now is how to ensure that there is 
increasing steadfastness. We hope that by the time 'Id al-Adha 
comes, the ferocity of the battles will have abated. If there 
is talk about salvation, it is an issue that concerns the other 
parties and political forces joining with us. We have reached 
an agreement with them on the principles for national salvation. 
  [Jazulit] What is the truth about al-'Anad? Sanaa insists it 
is in their hands, and proof of this is that it has sent some 
correspondents to the region; but you deny it. What is the real 
military situation in al-'Anad? 
  [Al-Bid] As I have repeated to you, al-'Anad is unyielding. 
Al-'Anad will not fall, nor will our values, courage, and 
ability to confront the aggressors. I assure you they will be 
forced to retreat. 
  [Jazulit] The fighting continues in the absence of Arab 
mediation, although there are extremely important political 
developments in Aden. Does this mean that events are heading 
toward secession? 
  [Al-Bid] I do not know what the final solution will be, 
because I cannot determine this alone. But I can tell you that 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared his secession on 27 April by 
declaring war. Now, after these massacres and sacrifices, I do 
not know how we could patch things up or what stand we will 
take. However, we will see what is best for Yemen. 
  [Jazulit] Will secession be one of the major alternatives of 
the YSP and the opposition in light of the intensity of the 
fighting? 
  [Al-Bid] We will do what the majority of the political 
forces 
and parties with whom we have reached agreements decide. We 
will follow the final formula we believe will be most suitable 
for running the affairs of our citizens. I tell those who are 
literally pushed to the battle front--they have now moved all 
the battles to the southern and eastern governorates--that the 
acts that some innocent people are being forced to do against 
their will is criminal, and it must stop. We call on all 
Yemenis, nationalists, and honest people in Yemen and abroad to 
put an end to this massacre that is taking place in the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, by Muhammad Karkuti in London; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Karkuti] The Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] has put forward an eight-point peace plan 
that was rejected by Sanaa. How do you assess Arab reaction to 
this initiative? Note that the initiative was proposed during a 
visit of an Arab League delegation to Sanaa, so what was the 
Arab League's reaction to this initiative? 
  [Muhammad] Arab and world media have reflected complete 
sympathy with the stand of our party and leadership toward this 
peaceful initiative, whether before or during the war. We are 
now defending our honor, property, homes, cities, and villages. 
We have not been on the offensive yet. We are against war. We 
support dialogue. We have exercised a policy of self-restraint, 
because over the past three years we had seen many practices, 
such as assassinations and liquidations of our party's leaders. 
All this did not make us lose patience or lose our mind. We 
have worked, and we are still calling for dialogue as the only 
language between the parties that have a different view of the 
complex Yemeni situation. [passage omitted] 
  [Karkuti] To say that the current crisis, which is tearing 
Yemen apart, is the result of foreign intervention is extremely 
doubtful. However, the tragic developments of the crisis make 
us reconsider the validity of this view. What is your personal 
opinion? If there are foreign and behind-the-scene forces 
working to ignite the crisis, who are these forces and what do 
they want? 
  [Muhammad] Yemen is not an isolated island. As you know, it 
is part of the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab world. What is 
happening now proceeds from two plans: a tribal plan, supported 
by an international fundamentalist movement, which is now trying 
to establish its state in Yemen; and another plan to establish 
an Arab Islamic state in this region that will have ideal and 
natural relations with Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the other Gulf 
states and the world. This plan will seek to develop Yemen 
according to the mentality of the late twentieth century and the 
beginning of the next century. There are people who waver 
between these two stands. This is why Yemen is today at a 
crossroads. 
  Therefore, it is not strange that Sudan should be supporting 
this latter scheme. Also, the religious fundamentalist movement 
is involved in supporting this trend and in removing all 
obstacles that arose as a result of unity and democracy to pave 
the way for this plan. Alliances will therefore depend on who 
supports and who allows this plan and who supports the other 
plan. As for the statements and attempts to win the favor of 
this or that party, they are all propaganda as a result of the 
hot military and political battle. 
  [Karkuti] Is it true that Iraq is playing a role in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] The supplies we saw in the battles were 
originally there in preparation for the recent Gulf war. We had 
expected this. This also was clear in the weapons the northern 
troops have. Iraqi delegations came before and during the war. 
This is also clear in the training and expertise. Consider 
also Iraq's attitude at the Arab League, which gives a true 
picture that Iraq, which should abandon this policy, is involved 
in supporting the military option in Yemen. It is enough to 
note the Iraqi Ba'th Party National Command statement that 
reflects its support for the military option that seeks war. 
  [Karkuti] How true are the reports that there are Iraqis 
with the northern forces? 
  [Muhammad] Yes, there are Iraqi experts with the Republican 
Guard. There are also Iraqi experts with the northern brigades. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Karkuti] What about the victims of the war. Do you have 
any figures? 
  [Muhammad] They are very huge and terrifying figures. They 
try to hide the figures from the public and the outside world. 
Entire brigades have been destroyed. Since they are attacking, 
then they must have sustained major losses, but they are hiding 
these facts. There are also huge losses among civilians, 
whether in al-Dali', Kirsh, Abyan, Mukayras, and also huge 
losses in Sanaa and 'Imran. There are social and economic 
damages known only to God alone. [passage omitted] 
  [Karkuti] What is the military situation now on the 
battlefield? 
  [Muhammad] The situation keeps changing. They are attacking 
in the Kirsh region and their attacks are being repulsed. There 
are also fierce battles in al-Dali'. They started another 
battle in Bayhan in Shabwah. This is in addition to the battles 
in Abyan. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former South Yemeni President 'Ali </F>
Nasir Muhammad in Damascus, by Shadiyah Riyad in Cairo; date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, a real catastrophe may be 
threatening not only fraternal Yemen but also the entire Arab 
region. What are your views on how to avoid this disaster? 
  [Muhammad] First, it pleases me to address the Arab people 
on 
the Cairo Radio. I would like to greet the fraternal Egyptian 
people and their leadership. I salute President Husni Mubarak, 
who has stood by the Yemeni people from the beginning of the 
crisis. He has actively made telephone calls and held meetings 
to contain the crisis that threatens national unity, security, 
and stability in Yemen and the security and stability of the 
region. Yemen is a littoral country on the Red Sea and the 
Arabian Sea, and so our country affects and is affected by what 
takes place around us in the region. In my view, the problem in 
Yemen is the responsibility of our brothers and friends. I am 
making efforts to help Yemen overcome this ordeal. 
  [Riyad] You say that the brothers and friends should 
shoulder 
their responsibilities. You met in Damascus with a number of 
envoys from Sanaa and Aden; do you sense that they are ready to 
accept Arab mediation efforts to address the crisis? 
  [Muhammad] In fact, the efforts by brothers and friends have 
not ceased; they are continuing. However, frankly speaking, 
what has happened and is happening in Yemen is the 
responsibility of the brothers there. The meeting of the Yemeni 
leaders in Amman and the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document there, their meeting in Salalah, and other meetings 
provided opportunities for direct dialogue between the political 
leaders in Yemen. Regrettably, numerous Arab and international 
overtures clashed with certain positions, prompting certain Arab 
leaders to balk. 
  Personally, I played a humble role last year and this year 
by making certain overtures and proposals to contain the crisis. 
Regrettably, my proposals and overtures contradicted certain 
positions, and thus failed. I acted out of my concern for the 
security and stability in Yemen and the region. I am following 
up on my efforts with my brothers and envoys, both in Yemen and 
abroad. I am following developments and am concerned to stop the 
bloodshed and halt the deterioration and collapse in Yemen. 
  [Riyad] Does this mean that there are mediation efforts by 
the Yemeni sons to address this crisis? 
  [Muhammad] As I noted, I already put forward certain 
overtures. I think that if the brothers there had responded to 
my overtures, they might have borne fruit and led to a 
relaxation of the situation. I held contacts a week ago with a 
number of Yemeni figures who are concerned about stability and 
want to contain the crisis in Yemen. They responded positively 
and welcomed my overture and the proposal to hold a meeting. 
They also welcome my readiness to go to Yemen. 
  I am holding contacts with the Yemeni leadership. If the 
Yemeni leadership and figures in the Arab homeland and outside 
agree, I am ready to go to Sanaa and Aden to help the Yemeni 
leadership contain the crisis, because the danger threatens 
everyone inside and outside Yemen and even the region and the 
Arab nation. Unity is not the exclusive province of the two 
Yemeni parties nor of certain individuals. Yemeni unity 
concerns all Yemeni people, for they and the Arab nation, 
particularly Egypt, made sacrifices for it. I consider that 
Yemeni unity is the fruit of the struggle by the Yemeni people, 
in both north and south. 
  [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, as you said, unity was the result of 
all the Yemeni people's struggle. But what is the future of 
this unity since the break caused by the war between the two 
sides? Can it be maintained when weapons are being used? 
  [Muhammad] I do not keep my view secret; very frankly, I 
support unity. I have said that I am opposed to fighting and to 
secession. The bloody events inflicted on the Yemeni people and 
their gains, on the army, the economy, and the citizens' morale 
could leave a deep rift in the people and in Yemen's unity. But 
there is no alternative. As for secession, Yemen cannot revert 
back to the 1990 borders, the year when unity was established. 
I have said this repeatedly and on several occasions, even to 
officials. I met yesterday with [name indistinct], who used to 
be foreign minister, and told him that it is impossible to go 
back to the 1990 borders. If Yemen is partitioned, then 
possibly more than one state and more than one entity will be 
established, and a series of conflicts and wars will break out 
between these entities in Yemen. This could affect Yemen's 
future. 
  [Riyad] Do you believe that dialogue is still possible? 
  [Muhammad] There is no other path than that of the dialogue. 
The doors to dialogue remain open amid all the wars that happen 
in the world. There are in fact bloody and painful battles 
today, but there is no path other than dialogue. Continuing the 
war means the complete destruction of everything. That is why I 
underlined the need to go back to the dialogue and to persist 
with it in order to stop the shedding of blood and to protect 
Yemeni national unity. 
  [Riyad] Do you think that the two sides are willing to stop 
the fighting and bloodshed? 
  [Muhammad] Everyone talks about going back to the dialogue, 
about a cease-fire and a disengagement. Everyone is talking, 
but the battles are in fact still raging even while I am talking 
to you. This is why I call again on the leaders to rely on the 
dialogue, the Constitution of the unified state, and the Pledge 
and Accord Document. 
  [Riyad] Thank you 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former president of 
[South] Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] Thank you for continuing to follow the situation 
in Yemen.

<F P=106> [Lutfi Shatarah report: "Sharp Differences Between Salih </F>
and His Military Commanders Over Appointment of 'Abd-Rabbuh 
Mansur as Defense Minister"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Two weeks after the outbreak of 
battles in Yemen between the northern and southern regular 
forces, serious indications have appeared on the ground 
supporting the southern leaders' claims that the war is not 
between the "legitimate forces" and "a group of mutineers from 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]," as claimed by Sanaa, but 
rather that it is a fierce war between northern forces supported 
by the militias of the Yemeni Reform Grouping led by Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, elements of the outlawed Jihad 
Organization, Afghan Arab groups from Sudan and other Arab 
states, and Iraqi military experts on the one hand, and southern 
forces on the other. 
  The southern resistance is continuing against the northern 
forces trying to breach southern defenses in several areas with 
the aim of putting pressure on Aden to force the YSP leaders to 
leave the country or surrender, that being the view of President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who has conveyed to the Arab League 
delegation his rejection of any cease-fire initiatives. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the political level, it has been revealed that sharp 
differences have emerged between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and the northern military commanders over the appointment of 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a supporter of former south Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, as defense minister. Sources 
have confirmed that Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, President 
Salih's half-brother, rejected that decision and that a number 
of northern military commanders maintained that as they were 
fighting southern regular forces, they would not accept a 
southern officer's assuming responsibility for the northern 
forces, whatever his political position against the southern 
leaders. 
  The sources said that President Salih proposed a compromise 
solution to prevent a military mutiny in the current 
circumstances, and he agreed to freeze the new minister's powers 
until after the war and after settlement of the porblem, but 
some northern commanders are pressing for the appointment of 
'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar as defense minister. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid, leader of the Sons of 
Yemen League, has stated that the aim of the announcement of the 
declaration of principles initiative signed the day before 
yesterday by the YSP and the opposition's National Bloc was to 
stop the fighting, form a government of national salvation, and 
thoroughly investigate who caused the fighting. 
  He warned that the opposition would stand against any side 
which did not respond to the initiative -- in a hint to the 
leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping. He added that Sanaa's rejection of the 
initiative left no alternative but the mobilization of all 
military, human, and moral resources to make Sanaa understand 
that no solution could be imposed by military force and that 
there must be a return to reason and to dialogue for the 
implementation of the national consensus document. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Bin-Farid added: "We 
have our own human resources, intrinsic capabilities, tribal 
relations, and the feeling that there is a right which must be 
upheld." He emphasized that the opposition devotes all its 
resources, big or small, to stopping this mad war. He also 
said: "Unity can only continue with the approval of the parties 
concerned, not by coercion and armed force. This war has been a 
blow to unity. [quotation marks as published]

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held its regular meeting 
this morning under the acting prime minister, Dr. Muhammad Sa'id 
al-'Attar. The Council discussed issues on the agenda, 
particularly reports presented to it on the military and 
security situation and the economic, supply, and information 
conditions under the current comprehensive national 
confrontation of the plot of apostasy, rebellion, and secession, 
which led the country to this situation with the aim of 
realizing the secessionists' desire which is opposed to the 
people and their unity and democracy, and undermining the 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  After discussing the various reports, the Council expressed 
its satisfaction with the great success of the brave Yemeni 
Armed Forces who are defending unity and legitimacy in 
confronting the forces of insurgency and secession. The Council 
emphasized the tasks and duties which the various ministries and 
departments of public utilities are expected to perform during 
the present circumstances. Foremost of these tasks are tackling 
and repairing the disorders which the insurgent secessionists 
planned, and dealing with the living conditions and the economic 
and supply situations in the country. This requires the 
implementation of a speedy plan to make available all the 
necessary needs of consumer goods in all the republic's 
governorates. 
  The Council decided to continue its meetings. The next 
session, which will be held tomorrow, will be devoted to 
discussing the detailed work of the executive and administrative 
sector and of each ministry. The Council agreed to the Civil 
Service Ministry's proposals concerning the holidays for the two 
great occasions, the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth 
anniversary of the Yemeni Republic. The Council assigned each 
minister the task of fixing these holidays in a manner that will 
not affect the daily work in all ministries and public utilities 
during the present circumstances.

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Eudes Barbier] </F>
  [Text] Dubai, May 18 (AFP)--Yemen's two-week-old civil war 
has begun to paralyze the country, hitting its oil industry and 
threatening the entire economy of one of the world's poorest 
nations. 
  Yemen relies heavily on foreign currency earned from exports 
of its total oil production of 320,000 barrels per day (bpd). 
But heavy fighting between rival north and south forces has 
badly hit the industry. 
  The Canadian oil company, Canoxy, has already suspended 
extraction of 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the al-Masilah 
fields in the eastern province of Hadramaut. 
  Tankers, faced with higher insurance fees because of the 
war, 
refuse to load at the port of al-Mukalla, 700 kilometers (435 
miles) east of the southern capital Aden and the destination of 
al- Masilah's oil. 
  However, the American oil company Hunt has continued to 
operate in another major field at Ma'rib, east of the capital 
Sanaa, piping out oil to the port of al-Hudaydah on the Red Sea. 
  The war has also created a rush on fuel in Sanaa, the 
northern capital cut off from oil supplies from the country's 
only refinery in the southern stronghold of Aden. 
  Long lines of people queue daily at gas stations for small 
quantities of fuel distributed by the army which has 
requisitioned most of the available supplies. 
  The operation of the Little Aden refinery, at the extreme 
west of the bay of Aden, is also threatened, even though it has 
been working to full capacity. Its output could be severely 
reduced or even halted by any suspension in al-Masilah's 
production if the fighting continues. 
  The fuel shortage is limiting the transport of goods and 
produce in the north. And, in the south, Aden is surrounded by 
fighting and can only be reached by sea. 
  But many shops and markets in Sanaa and Aden remain well 
stocked, despite panic-buying by some families. And banks and 
services also continue to operate in the cities, even though 
many are badly understaffed. 
  Schools in Aden have closed, and open only irregularly in 
the 
north as many foreign teachers have been evacuated. Residents 
of Aden are unable to leave the city, but Sanaa is almost 
deserted after people fled to take refuge in nearby villages. 
  The massive evacuation of thousands of European and Asian 
expatriates has also thrown many sectors of the economy in 
disarray. 
  But the fighting has not adversely affected the Yemeni 
currency which has only risen slightly to 80 rials a dollar in 
Sanaa and Aden, whereas before the war it was around 70 rials to 
the dollar. 
  Experts say the rial has been saved by a busy black market, 
always strong in Yemen, classed as one of the 32 least developed 
countries in the world.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--The repercussions of the war 
between north and south Yemen have been felt in its embassies 
and diplomatic missions abroad, especially after Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah issued a decree dismissing a 
number of southern Yemeni diplomats who work in its embassies 
abroad. Among these are Mr. Muhammad Shahir Sayf, acting Yemeni 
representative to the Arab League. 
  Mr. Shahir Sayf described the Yemeni foreign minister's 
request for the Arab League secretariat to withdraw Sayf's 
accreditation and for Sayf to return to Yemen as "unjust and 
illegitimate". 
  He said that Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas had instructed him to continue his duties in this 
position. He pointed out that the reason behind the dismissal 
from his duties is because he is a southerner. 
  Muhammad Shahir Sayf said the Yemeni foreign minister's 
decision to remove him from the Yemeni representative office in 
Cairo was a unilateral decision prompted by divisionist notions. 
He noted that the Yemeni foreign minister should have waited 
for the war to end before making such a decision. 
  Mr. Muhammad Shahir Sayf said that he does not take his 
orders from Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, but from 
Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas (a southerner), 
"whom I consider to be the legitimate prime minister despite 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's decision to dismiss 
him", he said. 
  He affirmed that he will stay in his position as acting 
permanent Yemeni representative to the Arab League. He pointed 
out that the representation office has already sent a letter 
regarding this matter to the Arab League Secretariat. 
  MENA has learned that one of the reasons Muhammad Shahir 
Sayf 
was dismissed was that he ignored Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah during the latter's recent visit to 
Cairo. Sayf also, without guidance from Sanaa, declined to head 
the latest emergency session of the Arab League Council. 
  It is worth noting here that Muhammad Shahir Sayf assumed 
his 
current position when Yemen's previous permanent representative 
to the Arab League, Ahmad al-Shajbi, travelled to London for 
treatment, where he died a few days ago and was buried in Cairo.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden. Your Armed 
Forces, who are defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, 
are advancing, with firmness and faithfulness, to pound at the 
fortifications of the forces of apostasy and secession and to 
save brave, steadfast Aden from the remnant soldiers of treason, 
terrorism, and agentry, so beloved Aden can return to the 
smiling face of the one united Yemen and resume its appropriate 
position as the trade and economic capital of the Republic of 
Yemen, in which goodness, security, peace, and stability will 
prevail under the banner of unity, democracy, and Constitutional 
legitimacy. 
  O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden: Your 
national, unionist leadership under the zealous national leader, 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
is very concerned about the security and peace of all the sons 
of the homeland, particularly the citizens in brave, lofty Aden. 
They are waiting with patience for the moment of great salvation 
at the hands of the forces of unity and Constitutional 
legitimacy. These brave lofty forces continued their sacred 
march toward brave Aden to save it from the pros of terrorism, 
crime, and bloody liquidation, the forces of apostasy and 
secession. 
  This is the last chance for all those who are misled by the 
forces of apostasy and secession to join the ranks of their 
brothers defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, to 
declare their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and 
unity, and to step with all bravery and courage on the stupidity 
of the forces of apostasy and secession. These forces, who are 
taking their last gasp, want to set Aden on fire and destroy it, 
as an expression of their grudge, stupidity, cowardice, and 
meanness. 
  The danger facing our people in brave Aden comes from the 
professionals of terrorism, crime, and destruction, the gang of 
apostasy and secession, not from their unionist Armed Forces, 
who are defending the dignity, life, stability, and security of 
the people, protecting their unity, safeguarding Constitutional 
legitimacy, and preserving blood, money, honor, and property 
from the danger of the forces of apostasy and secessions, who 
are using the bodies of our men, women, old men, and children in 
the brave and heroic city of Aden -- through force, coercion, 
threats, and violence -- as a human shield to protect 
themselves, now that they have lost all their losing cards and 
grown afraid of their future. They have only this rancorous, 
barbaric, terrorist method that shows their disregard for the 
lives of innocent people and their thirst to shed more chaste 
blood, thereby recording a new chapter in their bloody 
ill-omened history, which is already full of tragedies, 
massacres, and bloody liquidation in which tens of thousands of 
our innocent people were killed. 
  The forces of apostasy and secession know full well that 
the moment of the fall of their criminal and terrorist scheme is 
approaching and that the inevitable downfall of the symbols of 
apostasy and secession in the quagmire of treason and crime is 
imminent. Therefore, these forces will not hesitate to commit 
rancorous acts of revenge while they are dying. 
  Hence, the sons of our people, particularly our free, 
faithful brothers in brave Aden, must be fully alert and 
vigilant to foil the last chapters of the treasonous and 
secessionist conspiracy. They must be fully confident that the 
forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy are very concerned 
about the citizens' life, property, security, and stability. In 
fact, this concern is greater than their concern about the lives 
of their brave soldiers, equipment, and weapons. They are the 
forces of the people who protect the people, their achievements, 
security, stability, and Constitutional legitimacy. These 
forces are for the people, not for an individual party, faction, 
or separatist clique to protect their individual narrow 
interests. They are the forces of revolution, unity, and 
democracy which only aim their guns at traitors, rebels against 
Constitutional legitimacy, and violators of people's options. 
  Therefore, the sons of our honest and unionist people in 
brave Aden need to be aware of this important fact and to be 
very confident and reassured that their brothers, the sons of 
the Armed Forces -- the forces of unity, Constitutional 
legitimacy, and democracy -- endeavor, with all honesty, love, 
faithfulness, and concern, to save them from the tyranny of the 
terror traitors, the advocates of apostasy, separation, agentry, 
and treason. All honest civilians and military in brave, 
unionist Aden should join the ranks of unity and Constitutional 
legitimacy with all faithfulness, bravery, courage, and heroism 
in order to write, together with their courageous brothers in 
the Yemeni Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and 
Constitutional legitimacy -- the chapter of freedom from the 
nightmare of the forces of apostasy, separation, terrorism, and 
treason, and to champion the will of their lofty, faithful, and 
great people. Victory comes only from God.

Kuwait received Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, Yemeni minister of 
oil and mineral resources and envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of Yemen's Presidential Council. The envoy briefed the 
amir on the critical situation in Yemen and the sad developments 
and painful events there. 
  The amir expressed Kuwait's deep sorrow for the bloodshed, 
the killing, and the waste of resources in Yemen. The amir 
clearly stated Kuwait's continuing stance of rejecting any use 
of force in settling conflicts. He said that national duty 
required an immediate cease-fire and the start of negotiations 
to discuss in a true spirit of brotherhood all differences in 
order to spare the Yemeni people from the tragedies of fighting 
and bloodshed. 
  The amir of Kuwait stressed that dialogue is the way to 
understanding and reconciliation and that Kuwait, which strongly 
believes in principles of brotherhood and spares no efforts to 
spread these principles, categorically rejects the use of force 
to solve conflicts. The amir expressed the wish that the 
officials in Yemen would take seriously the genuine calls for an 
immediate halt to the fighting and for an agreement to end the 
differences peacefully. [passage omitted]

still surrounded by the Saudi police force. We draw your 
attention to this report: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Today, the Saudi soldiers 
deployed special commandoes outside the headquarters gate to 
prevent headquarters staff and other visitors from entering. 
Thanks to implementation of this order, staff of the esteemed 
leader's Hajj headquarters have been compelled to remain inside 
the building. 
  The Saudi police, after hours of controlling the comings and 
goings and preventing the arrival and exit of individuals from 
the headquarters, permitted individuals to come and go for a few 
hours at 1930 hours local time yesterday evening. Movement in 
and out of the headquarters was banned again at midday today. 
Saudi military helicopters also resumed reconnaissance flights 
and air maneuvers over the headquarters building starting at 
midday today. The Saudi security officials are videotaping the 
esteemed leader's headquarters and anybody coming in or going 
out.

  [Text] Mecca, May 18, IRNA -- Iran's embassy in Riyadh in a 
strongly-worded letter to the Saudi Foreign Ministry Wednesday 
[18 May] condemned the continued siege of the Iranian pilgrims 
headquarters in Mecca by Saudi troops. The letter said the 
crackdown on the movement of Iranian pilgrims to and from the 
camp has seriously hampered the pilgrimage of Iranian Muslims. 
  Saudi commandos have been stationed in front of the 
headquarters barring people from entering or leaving the 
building. Since this morning, Saudi military helicopters have 
started flying at low altitude over the headquarters and filming 
all movements around it. 
  The deployment of scores of armored personnel carriers, 
water 
cannons and a large number of armed-to-the-teeth commandos 
around the camp indicates that Saudi Arabia has purchased large 
amounts of riot equipment for fear of outbreak of domestic 
unrest and rebellion. 
  According to an Egyptian pilgrim, who is a member of the 
armed forces of that country, Saudi Arabia has been deeply 
worried about possible domestic unrest in recent years 
particularly since the deployment of American forces in holy 
Islamic lands during the Persian Gulf war which prompted public 
outcry. 
  Due to such concern, he said, Saudi leaders have spent 
billions of dollars on purchase of anti-riot equipment and 
training some of its military units in suppressing domestic 
riots.

  [Text] Holy Mecca, May 19, IRNA -- The siege of the Iranian 
pilgrim headquarters here by the Saudi security forces ended at 
22:00 hours Wednesday [18 May]. 
  A very big column of all types of armoured vehicles had 
covered the area and al-'Aziz street in order to prevent the 
holding of the annual disavowal of polytheists rally by Iranian 
and other pilgrims. 
  Over the past week Saudi police had harrassed the pilgrims 
and visitors to the HQ. 
  The besiege was severely condemned by Iranian and other 
pilgrims, and the Saudi measure has given rise to widespread 
reaction. 
  On Monday night, the leader of the Iranian pilgrims, Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri announced the cancellation 
of the rally, in order not to give an excuse to the Saudi police 
to once again desecrate the sanctity of the most inviolable 
sanctuary the Holy Ka'ba.

  [Text] His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, 
United Arab Emirates [UAE] President, last night received a 
phone call from 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council, within the framework of the ongoing 
contacts and the intensive efforts his highness exerts with 
respect to the Yemeni crisis. 
  Discussion during the telephone contact dealt with the 
situation in the Yemeni arena. Shaykh Zayid reiterated the 
UAE's pressing desire for a cease-fire, pointing out that it is 
regrettable that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih still 
insists on pursuing the fighting in spite of the recurrent 
sincere calls his highness has addressed to his excellency since 
the very first moment of the war of brothers. His highness 
Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan further said during the 
telephone contact: I have repeatedly appealed to the Yemeni 
president. I have exerted all possible effort to immediately 
stop firing. We have said we are ready to pursue mediation 
efforts in Yemen with every means we have to sincerely and 
loyally reconcile the brothers so Yemen remains stable and so 
differences among them will be submitted to the fraternal Yemeni 
people whom will decide on them and have their final say, 
instead of this recourse to arms. The Yemeni people are a free 
people like all others, and their fate does not belong to anyone. 
  He added: The Yemeni people know where their real interest 
lies and their happiness and stability are the objectives that 
all should seek. 
  From his part, the Yemeni vice president called on the head 
of state in the telephone contact to pursue with his well-known 
wisdom his persistent efforts with his brother Arab leaders to 
stop the raging battles and the bloody war and to resort to 
fraternal dialogue to reach a political solution to the crisis 
out of concern for the safety of Yemeni citizens and to 
safeguard national unity. 
  The Yemeni vice chairman added: Why this shedding of blood 
and the fighting among the sons of the one people for one or two 
persons? Has the aggression against the south come from an 
enemy of the Yemeni people? It is inconceivable that a dialogue 
be held between the two parties while the fighting continues. 
No side can be attacked and remain idle and accept the 
imposition of a solution on it. The language of force and the 
military method in settling differences is rejected and portends 
dire consequences. The homeland's interest should be given 
priority over any other interest.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 17 May (WAKH) -- His Highness Shaykh 
Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE], received a telephone call from Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih this evening. 
  The Emirates News Agency said views were exchanged on the 
current developments in Yemen and the bloody fighting between 
brothers. It added that Shaykh Zayid stressed the urgent need 
to stop Yemeni fighting in order to pave the way for the 
continuation of his highness's efforts to reconcile the Yemeni 
brothers' views. 
  The UAE president appealed to the Yemeni president to do his 
best to put an immediate end to fighting and to exercise maximum 
self-restraint in order to spare blood and safeguard the 
people's lives. He said there will be no victor or vanquished 
among the sons of the one country and that the real loser will 
be the Yemeni people, who will suffer from the destruction 
inflicted on them. 
  Shaykh Zayid regretted what is happening as well as the 
Yemeni president's failure to respond to the repeated calls to 
stop the fighting, stressing that what is taking place is a 
disaster for Yemen and the Arab nation.

  [Text] Aden, May 18 (AFP)--This southern bastion echoed to 
the thunder of artillery on Wednesday [18 May] as fighting 
between rival Yemeni forces moved markedly closer, an AFP 
correspondent reported. 
  It was the first time the sound of battle could be heard so 
clearly in the port city of Aden, stronghold of Vice-President 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, whose forces are fighting off a northern 
offensive. 
  And it triggered fear among the population of 500,000, who 
had been reassured only the night before that the southerners 
were keeping the offensive at bay. 
  Remaining foreigners crowded the port trying to board an 
Indian and a Pakistani ship which were due to set sail. Nearly 
280 Indians were scheduled to leave during the day, a port 
official said. 
  Northern troops, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
are 
locked in a bitter struggle with al-Bid's forces at al-'Anad, a 
strategically important air base 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the 
north of Aden. 
  There also fighting at Zinjibar, to the east, and Haraz, to 
the west. 
  Artillery fire could be heard near the city on Wednesday to 
both the north and east. 
  Al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party has stepped up conscription, 
taking thousands of youths to the front, willingly or not, 
aboard party vehicles that were criss-crossing the city. 
  Salih has rejected international appeals for a ceasefire and 
insists that al-Bid and his aids surrender or flee into exile. 
  The civil war was about to enter its third week with no end 
in sight. 
  It has shattered the uneasy four-year old union between the 
conservative North and Marxist South.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, today visited the al-Sab'in Camp. He was 
received by the camp's commander, officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and soldiers. He addressed them, expressing his 
happiness at meeting with them and reviewing the current 
situation in our country at this critical stage in its history, 
during which our Yemeni people and their Armed Forces--the 
forces of unity and legitimacy--are waging a valiant struggle 
for the sake of defending the homeland and preserving its unity 
and the accomplishments of the revolution, for which they have 
offered the dearest of sacrifices. 
  The brother president and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces said: This fighting, which was imposed on our people and 
Armed Forces by the gang of apostasy and secession in the 
Socialist Party leadership, has made it incumbent on the masses 
of our people, headed by our Armed Forces--the forces of unity 
and Constitutional legitimacy--to rise in defense of the dearest 
of their national aims and confront the remnants of apostasy and 
secession, who sold their consciences, and abandoned the values 
of belonging to this homeland and their loyalty to its martyrs 
who shed their blood for the sake of the unity of the 
homeland--land and people. 
  The brother supreme commander of the Armed Forces praised 
the 
high morale of the officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers of our Armed Forces--the forces of unity and 
legitimacy. He greeted this high militant spirit and the 
splendid combat performance as embodied by the heroes in the 
arenas of national struggle in defense of the gains of the 
Yemeni revolution and people. 
  In his speech, the brother president invoked mercy on the 
souls of martyrs, who sacrificed their lives so the banner of 
unity and Republic of Yemen will continue to fly as high as the 
mountains of Yemen and as solid as the solidity of its blessed, 
brave sons. He stressed that the state will look after the 
families and children of martyrs and will extend to them all 
good care and sound education. He stressed the importance of 
maintaining discipline and vigilance and care for the people's 
interests. He said officers, noncommissioned, and soldiers in 
the battle should set an example to others with good conduct, 
high discipline, and the sense of responsibility and the noble 
mission they are performing for the sake of the people, 
homeland, and unity. 
  Brother Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil, minister of 
the interior, accompanied the brother chairman of the 
Presidential Council.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that in his 
meeting with Yasir 'Arafat it was agreed that the PLO chairman 
would not arrive in the territories on 6 June, which is an 
emotionally charged date in the historic sense. Peres expressed 
disappointment with Jordan's hesitation and said that the 
regional economic conference slated to take place there had been 
moved to Morocco. 
  Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts reports that Foreign Minister 
Peres met with French President Francois Mitterrand this 
evening. In their meeting, Mitterrand presented France's 
position that there is no necessary link between the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations and the Lebanese track. Peres 
replied that Lebanon's positions were too tightly linked to 
Syria's. President Mitterrand promised to help Israel gain full 
membership in the European Community in all matters related to 
science and research. This has met with the objections of 
several countries, including the United Kingdom. 
  Our correspondent adds that Foreign Minister Peres 
participated in a festive ceremony in memory of singer Yves 
Montand. The proceeds of the event will go to a cancer research 
laboratory named after the singer at the Weizman Institute.

  [Excerpts] Yisra'el Peleg, the director general of the 
Environment Ministry, met in Tunis with Tunisian Environment 
Minister Mohamed Mehdi Mlika who promised to visit Israel in the 
near future. 
  Peleg, who heads the Israeli delegation to the conference of 
Mediterranean countries in Tunis, handed the Tunisian minister 
an invitation to visit Israel from Environment Minister Yosi 
Sarid. Minister Mlika hoped that his visit to Israel would be 
possible as soon as Israel wrapped up the last details with the 
Palestinians. "God willing, I will come to visit," Mlika said, 
sending personal regards to Yosi Sarid. [passage omitted] 
  At the end of the second day of discussions, there was 
disagreement between the Tunisians and the other delegations on 
the establishment of a special committee that would promote 
development projects independently of the Barcelona Treaty for 
Environmental Protection. A proposal initiated by the the 
Israeli delegation facilitated a compromise according to which 
Tunis' recommendation to establish a Mediterranean committee for 
sustainable development was accepted. The date for a discussion 
of the proposal's details, however, will be scheduled at the 
next conference in 1995. 
  At the end of the session, the Tunisian representative said 
he appreciated Israel's contribution in breaking the impasse.

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 19 (AFP) -- Arab budgets, already hit 
by low oil prices, are reeling under heavy defence spending at 
the expense of development allocations, an official Arab report 
said on Thursday [19 May]. 
  In countries such as Syria and Yemen, defence and security 
expenditure consumed nearly half the total government spending 
while in the oil-rich Gulf states it far exceeded allocations 
for public and social services, said the report by the Abu 
Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). 
  The report gave no new figures for Saudi Arabia, which has 
sharply boosted defence spending since the Gulf war. 
  It also did not cover Iraq, believed to be the region's 
biggest spender on defence as it had the strongest army in the 
Arab world before being crushed by a U.S.-led coalition in the 
Gulf war in early 1991 after it invaded Kuwait. 
  Most Arab states do not divulge figures on defence spending 
but Gulf nations have made no secret of their intentions to 
bolster their armies. 
  Military experts believe Saudi Arabia and its five partners 
in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) may spend more than 50 
billion dollars on arms by 2000. 
  "High defence spending is one of the reasons for the 
economic 
problems in the Arab world and persistent budget deficits in 
wealthy Gulf states," said a Western diplomat in the region. 
  "Imagine what could have happened if half of the defence 
allocations had been channeled into development." 
  The AMF said defence expenditure in the 22-member Arab 
League 
accounted for 28.07 percent of the total 1992 spending of 172 
billion dollars. This compared with 34.78 percent of the 1991 
spending of 180.16 billion dollars. 
  Syria, which is still technically at war with neighbouring 
Israel, emerged as the top spender on defence and security in 
the region, with allocations of 54.5 percent of the 1992 budget 
of 3.12 billion dollars. 
  Yemen, now torn by civil strife, came second, with 
allocations of 44.55 percent of the total 1992 spending of 4.83 
billion dollars. 
  Defence spending stood at 43.75 percent in Oman, at 39 
percent in Kuwait, 36 percent in Qatar, 35.89 percent in the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE), 34.54 percent in Bahrain, 32.23 
percent in Jordan and 27.8 percent in Libya. 
  In Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia and Mauritania, it ranged 
between 14 and 26 percent while there were no figures for 
Lebanon, Djibouti and Somalia. Defence spending in Algeria was 
the lowest, standing at 8.23 percent. 
  The report gave figures for Saudi Arabia in 1989, when the 
defence budget accounted for 25 percent of the total expenditure 
of 40 billion dollars. But experts believe the level could have 
risen as the world's top oil producer and exporter has pressed 
ahead with massive armament plans. 
  Except for Jordan, Arab states suffered from budget deficits 
in 1992 while foreign debt, excluding that owed by Iraq, Libya 
and GCC nations, exceeded 150 billion dollars. 
  A trade and balance of payments deficit also persisted in 
Arab states, except in major oil producers. 
  In Kuwait, the budget deficit soared as high as 84 percent 
of 
the Gross Domestic Product while it reached 10.3 percent in 
Sudan, 10 percent in Yemen, 8.71 percent in Saudi Arabia and 
7.28 percent in Jordan. 
  The AMF report showed Arab spending on public services 
accounted for 18.67 percent in 1992 while allocations for social 
services stood at 26.43 percent and for economic development at 
12.78 percent. 
  "High defence allocations underscore the importance of peace 
in the Middle East," a Gulf-based diplomat said. "It will pay 
off not only in political and military terms, but in economic 
terms.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F>
Tunis, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd in Cairo; date not given; from 
the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Dear Arab brothers, peace be upon you. 
The Arab and Islamic nation is celebrating two happy occasions: 
The blessed 'Id al-Adha and the return of the Palestinian 
people and the Palestinian authority to their land. Your 
Excellency President 'Arafat: Congratulations to the 
Palestinian people on these two occasions. Perhaps we should 
start with a word to the struggling Palestinian people and the 
Arab and Islamic nation. 
  ['Arafat] First, I thank you very much for giving me this 
good chance to speak through the Voice of the Arabs, the voice 
of the Arab nation, in these blessed and holy days. Within 
hours, God willing, Muslims will pray on 'Arafat Mount [in 
Mecca] and we hope that prayers will soon be held, God willing, 
in holy Jerusalem, the first of the two qiblahs [direction in 
which Muslims turn to pray] and the third of the holy shrines, 
the city to which Prophet Muhammad, may God's peace and prayers 
be upon him, journeyed, and the cradle of Jesus, peace be upon 
him. 
  As we mark this occasion, the Palestinian police force has 
entered Jericho and Gaza, from which the Israelis fully withdrew 
hours ago. Gaza and Jericho became the first liberated 
Palestinian territory over which the Palestinian flag was 
raised. And it is the first over which Palestinian authority is 
being exercised since the beginning of this century. This 
signifies much and indicates many things, not only on the 
political, national, and pan-Arab levels, but on the level of 
history and the region as a whole. 
  I must note the good efforts of my brother President 
Muhammad 
Husni Mubarak, who, using everything in his power, helped us to 
advance this process. The blessed efforts of President Mubarak 
and my other brothers in Egypt were crowned by the agreement we 
signed in Cairo under his patronage and supervision. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] The main question now is: When can the Voice 
of the Arabs speak with Your Excellency in Jericho, the land of 
Palestinian authority now, so that we can all rejoice in your 
return and you can assume your duties among your kin and in your 
homeland? 
  ['Arafat] Soon, God willing. We hope that in June we will 
contact you either from Gaza or from Jericho and I will speak 
through the Voice of the Arabs, which is dear to me and to all 
your mujahid Palestinian brothers. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Many tasks await you. You must have prepared 
plans and programs to carry out these tasks in Gaza and Jericho 
first. Can we hear of these tasks and plans, which are designed 
for the wellbeing of the Palestinian people? 
  ['Arafat] We have received 38 tasks, that is, the 
responsibilities in Gaza and Jericho. Now we are assuming 
between five and seven other responsibilities in the West Bank 
and, God willing, we will begin talks immediately after 'Id 
al-Adha on all the arrangements concerning the West Bank. We 
hope the talks will be held in Cairo. You must be patient with 
us. I am sure my brothers in Egypt tolerate us. But, after all, 
this is what you expect from brothers. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Naturally we were pleased to see the 
Palestinian people retrieve their rights in Cairo, Egypt, a 
country that loves Arabism and the struggle for its nation and 
bears the burden of its causes. You met Israeli Foreign 
Minsiter Shim'on Peres in Oslo recently and reports indicate 
that you agreed to pursue negotiations on implementing 
Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip, the Jericho area, and 
later in the West Bank. What are the most important tasks that 
you are expected to assume in the West Bank and when will the... 
  ['Arafat, interrupting] There are at least five to seven 
tasks concerning basic fields, such as education, health, 
tourism, social affairs, work, culture, taxes, and possibly some 
security issues. Then we must agree with them on redeploying 
their forces outside cities and populous areas on sites to be 
agreed upon on 15 July. This is a very important point. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] When will the Palestinian elections take place 
within the framework of the National Authority? 
  ['Arafat] Following the Israeli forces' redeployment and 
withdrawal from residential areas in the West Bank after their 
complete withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, we are supposed to 
initiate measures for elections on our Palestinian land, God 
willing. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What are the features and dimensions of the 
future Egyptian-Palestinian political and economic cooperation 
from the security, national, and pan-Arab points of view? 
  ['Arafat] Let me tell you something. This Palestinian body 
cannot but be connected with its Arab nation, especially the 
loving brothers in Egypt and Jordan, its two close neighbors. 
We are linked with the Arab nation. Our true supporter is the 
Arab nation. It was no coincidence that the political 
negotiations were held there and the handover of authority and 
the entry of forces into our liberated land began from these 
places. It is no coincidence that the Egyptian experts provided 
us with great help in the economic talks, because we needed this 
Egyptian expertise as well as the expertise of our Jordanian 
brothers, who supported and extended help to us through their 
experts. Nothing can happen except through our agreement and 
reliance on this warm Arab lap on every level. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] The international community has promised to 
give you 2 billion [currency not specified] over five years 
after the launch of Palestinian self-rule. And we know that the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho are suffering a severe lack of economic 
potential, especially when it comes to the infrastructure. Have 
any of these promises been made good or is there at least a 
contingency plan to begin ... 
  ['Arafat, interrupting] We have submitted a snap contingency 
plan worth $590 million to the World Bank. The donor parties 
are scheduled to meet on 1 June to look into this plan, which 
was agreed upon in principle in the previous Paris meeting. 
  We need a concerted effort, not only with the World Bank and 
donors, but with all our friends and brothers, because what we 
need is great, very great. Don't forget that all our 
infrastructure has been destroyed by the Israeli occupation and 
we must start from scratch in every area. This is a great 
effort and it requires huge resources but we are confident that 
our Arab nation and friends throughout the world together with 
the Palestinian people's resources can prove themselves and 
confront all these important responsibilities that we shoulder. 
"And we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed 
in the land, to make them leaders (in faith) and make them 
heirs, to establish a firm place for them in the land" [Koranic 
verses]. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] When will the names of the Palestinian 
Authority members be announced? 
  ['Arafat] We have announced 17 names. God willing, we will 
announce most of the remaining names within a week at most. 
This is because we will leave some names unannounced until the 
picture becomes complete. We might announce another three or 
four names. God willing, the first meeting of the National 
Authority, that is, the first Palestinian ministerial meeting, 
will be held next week. Portfolios and responsibilities will be 
distributed during this meeting. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Will the meeting be held in Jericho or Tunis? 
  ['Arafat] It could be held in Jericho or elsewhere. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But will all the PLO institutions move with 
you 
to Jericho or will some remain in Tunis? 
  ['Arafat] Only the political department will remain abroad. 
The remaining institutions will gradually move inside. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Why the political department? 
  ['Arafat] Because the Palestinian National Authority is 
represented in foreign relations by the PLO. It cannot 
establish diplomatic representation except through the PLO. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Discussing the Arab situation, we do not 
forget 
the regrettable events in Yemen. These events naturally affect 
us all. What is your view of the situation in Yemen and will 
you undertake an initiative to solve this crisis? 
  ['Arafat] I have been in constant touch with my brothers the 
Yemeni leaders in the past 48 hours. I have left my telephone 
number with my brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih so that he 
will contact me as soon as possible. We will do our best to 
stop the bloodbath in Arab Yemen. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] While we are on the phone between Cairo and 
Tunis, we ask Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to address the Arab and 
Islamic nations. 
  ['Arafat] I want to remind my brothers of something. Once, a 
Soviet leader asked me: After you leave Beirut, where will you 
go? I told him: To Palestine. God willing, my brothers and I 
will go to Palestine. "On that day the believers shall rejoice. 
With the help of God, he helps whom he will. And he is exalted 
in might, most merciful." [Koranic verse] Verily, God told the 
truth. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] At the end of this interesting dialogue with 
Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, we say: 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
  ['Arafat] My good wishes, thanks, and congratulations to my 
brother struggling President Husni Mubarak and to the Egyptian 
people and to my brothers in the whole Arab nation.

  [Text] The PLO' chief negotiator, Nabil Sha'th, arrived 
last night in the Gaza Strip for an unannounced visit. An aide 
said Sha'th was making a 24-hour inspection trip. 
  He crossed the border from Egypt, and after a brief stop in 
Khan Yunus, went into conference with Palestinian officials at a 
Gaza sea front hotel. Sha'th said it was his first visit to 
Gaza Strip in 30 years. He is to hold a post on the council 
which is to administer Gaza and Jericho.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief of the Palestinian </F>
negotiating delegation, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Gaza on 20 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, first of all many happy 
returns on the 'Id and welcome to Gaza. 
  [Sha'th] I welcome you and wish you, too, many happy 
returns. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the visit is perhaps a surprise short 
visit to the Gaza Strip? What is the purpose of this visit? 
  [Sha'th] First of all, I have come to see my homeland. This 
is the first time I have entered Palestine since 1964. My last 
visit to Gaza was in 1964. Therefore, this is a chance for me, 
even for a few moments, to see this beloved homeland, Gaza, and 
its skies and land, and these great people in Gaza. That's why 
when the opportunity presented itself to see Gaza, I did not let 
it pass. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] wanted to reassure 
himself 
about the situation. He gave me some money that is needed by 
the police force in Gaza. Let us say that it is a small present 
so things will begin in the proper perspective and then, God 
willing, all necessary funds will flow when international 
material assistance becomes available. We will also meet with 
the brothers at brother Abu-'Ammar's request to see about, at 
least, the preliminary and necessary needs after the first week 
of our forces' arrival and the establishment of our authority in 
preparation for the arrival of brother Abu-'Ammar and the 
brothers in the command. God willing, I will be with them. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how do you assess the 
implementation on the ground of the agreement between the 
Israeli and Palestinian side? 
  [Sha'th] With all sincerity, I see that matters are 
proceeding far better than in the best of expectations. Of 
course, I believe matters are going this well because our 
Palestinian people, at least here in Gaza and in Jericho, want 
this agreement to succed. There is complete popular cooperation 
with the Palestinian police. They have adopted the police 
force. Let me say that the people, with their generosity and 
sincere national sense have adopted their soldiers and their 
police force. They are doing all they can to enable them carry 
out their duties as easily as possible. I have noticed, too, 
that, in reality, there are no large problems concerning 
coordination between the Palestinian police force and the 
withdrawing Israeli forces. I believe the beginning of work is 
positive on all levels. We hope we will be able to offer the 
necessary support to complete the requirements for success. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, perhaps you do not know, but an 
incident 
took place at Erez junction. Two IDF soldiers were fired on and 
killed. The perpetrators fled into the autonomy area in Gaza. 
  [Sha'th] No doubt, there will be incidents. However, what is 
important is that the will should exist to overcome them and to 
gradually prevent all acts of violence and move toward real 
peace, which our people and the Israeli people undoubtedly need. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th from Gaza, thank you very much 
and 
many happy returns, and welcome. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you, and through you I send greetings to all 
the sons of our people throughout our beloved Palestine on the 
'Id and to our brothers in the Galilee, the Negev, Yafo, and 
everywhere.

  [Text] The Palestinian police will not permit armed Jews 
to enter the ancient synagogue in Jericho. This was stated 
today by the Palestinian police commander during a visit to the 
site. The supreme coordinating committee on security affairs 
visited Jericho today to get a first-hand impression of the 
problems at the ancient Shalom 'Al Yisra'el synagogue. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] The Palestinian police have so far 
been unsuccessful in carrying out their duties in Jericho and 
the Gaza Strip. This was reported this evening by security 
sources. The sources assert that the situation is far more 
serious in the Gaza Strip. In addition to the security 
problems, the area is also in the midst of a crime wave with the 
victims being the Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and Israeli 
citizens inside the Green Line. The situation is far from 
satisfactory in Jericho either. The supreme coordinating 
committee on security affairs headed by Brigadier General 
Yom-Tov Sami' and General Ziyad al-Atrash held a meeting at the 
coordinating committee offices near the entrance to Jericho. 
They were accompanied by the commander in chief of the 
Palestinian police, Nasr Yusuf, who, speaking near the ancient 
synagogue in Jericho, said that his men would not permit armed 
Jews to enter the synagogue because according to the Cairo 
agreement the Palestinians were responsible for security in the 
vicinity of the synagogue. 
  The Cairo agreement does not permit armed people to visit 
the 
area. We are responsible for security in this area, Nasr Yusuf 
stressed. We will protect anyone visiting this place, he said. 
While Nasr Yusuf was speaking, armed yeshiva students were 
inside the synagogue. The Palestinian police commander was 
apparently expressing his opinion on the matter and it will be 
brought up for discussion before the coordinating committee on 
security affairs. 
  It should be noted that since the entry of the Palestinian 
police force into Jericho on 13 May, several disagreements have 
arisen between them and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
representatives on the coordinating committee with regard to the 
routes followed by the joint patrols and the interpretation of 
the Cairo agreement with regard to responsibility for the 
ancient synagogue. Joint patrols have deviated from their 
scheduled routes. Stationary patrols, which were meant to 
intervene only in specially defined cases, drove up to the gates 
of Jewish settlements such as Elisha' and Na'ama. Jordan Valley 
settlers have complained that since the inception of Palestinian 
Autonomy there has been a wave of thefts of agricultural 
equipment and produce, a mini-tractor, and even an Uzi 
submachine gun was stolen from the home of a resident of Tomer. 
Palestinian Police Commander Nasr Yusuf appealed to the 
residents of the Jericho autonomous area and asked them to help 
the Palestinian policemen to uphold law and order now that the 
Israeli occupation has ended forever. [end recording] 
  [In a similar report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1505 GMT on 19 May, settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman 
reports that "the settlers have presented the police and the IDF 
with a long list of complaints concerning thefts from their 
settlements, especially from those adjacent to the Jericho area. 
For example, four days ago, someone broke into a house in the 
settlement of Tomer, stole the owner's Uzi submachine gun, and 
fled on a mini-tractor that had been parked nearby. The 
settlers claim that an IDF jeep pursued the thief up to the 
entrance to the village of al-'Awja'. Since this village is 
situated inside the Palestinian autonomy, the IDF soldiers broke 
off the chase at the village gates." The report notes that "the 
IDF takes a grave view of this phenomena. The local commanders, 
during a vociferous meeting two days ago, promised the settlers 
that they would take action to resolve the problem."]

  [Text] Tunis, May 20 (AFP)--The Palestinian Fatah 
movement--the main component of the PLO--has swapped its 
revolutionary rhetoric for words more suited to climate of peace. 
  Two weeks after the Cairo accords on Palestinian autonomy in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the traditional references to 
"struggle in all its forms" were replaced Thursday [19 May] by 
an appeal for "effort and perseverance in the building of the 
homeland". 
  A communique issued here by the Fatah revolutionary council 
also made history by using the name "Israel" for the first time 
instead of its usual "Zionist enemy". 
  The Fatah ruling body said that in future it would fight on 
a 
"cultural and economic" level. "That will be the real test 
between us and Israel," it said. 
  Fatah renewed its call for "unity" in Palestinian ranks and 
in support of "Arab brethren" during the shift from armed 
warfare to "realisation on the ground". 
  The estimated 100 members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council 
endorsed the accords signed in Cairo on May 4 and set up some 15 
ad-hoc committees to assist the Palestinian authority in the 
autonomous territories, informed sources said. 
  Fatah holds most of the seats in the 24-member autonomous 
"government", 18 of whose members are already known. 
  The Fatah committees will be responsible for transferring 
350 
Palestine Liberation Organisation cadres starting next week. 
  Their other tasks will include assisting the Palestinian 
authority in its future negotiations with Israel and preparing 
elections to the autonomous council next autumn, the sources 
said.

  [Text] Palestinian organizations opposed to the bargain 
agreement between the PLO and the Zionist entity have refused to 
hand over their weapons to 'Arafat's supporters in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
spokesman in Damascus, said that the Palestinian police must 
first of all disarm the Zionist occupation forces. 
  He added: Any person who tries to deprive us of our right to 
confront the enemy will be killed. 
  Meanwhile a spokesman for George Habash's Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine announced that the front's forces 
will not lay down their arms as long as one Zionist soldier or 
settler remains in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. 
  A spokesman for Nayif Hawatimah's Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine also opposed disarming the Palestinian 
organizations. He said any Zionist settler or soldier seen in 
Gaza or Jericho will be killed.

  [Text] In Amman, Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah has said 
that his movement will allow nobody to disarm it as long as 
there is Israeli occupation. Ghawshah was commenting on 
statements made by Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the 
Palestinian Police, who announced in Gaza yesterday that he will 
organize carrying of arms in the self-rule area. Ghawshah 
stressed that the issue of disarming is a red line, adding that 
we advise the Palestinian police not to cross this line.

Palestinian Entity Modest, but Promising Start"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- 'Afif Safiyah, Palestinian delegate to 
the UK, has said that there is a pragmatic wing inside the 
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) which should be encouraged. 
He pointed out that the movement has so far acted "very 
responsibly." He said that the Palestinian entity emerging in 
Gaza and Jericho is a modest, but promising start. 
  Replying to the clamor over the content of a tape of 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat during his meeting with 
Muslims in a South African mosque, in which he called for jihad 
for the sake of Jerusalem, he said that there is always 
linguistic argument about the concept and meaning of the word 
jihad. He pointed out that 'Arafat called for jihad for the 
sake of Jerusalem, "that is, to strive collectively to liberate 
Jerusalem peacefully." Safiyah said that Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin continues to speak of Jerusalem as the eternal 
capital of Israel. "What is important is the international will 
represented in the resolutions adopted by the Security Council 
and the General Assembly, which consider Jerusalem an occupied 
territory from which Israel must withdraw." 
  In a lecture delivered in London the evening of the day 
before yesterday at the invitation of the "Council for 
Arab-British Understanding" (CABU), Safiyah dealt with a number 
of controversial issues on the Palestinian scene, including the 
peace process since the Madrid and Washington negotiations 
through to the Oslo and Cairo negotiations, in addition to the 
future of the PLO, the Palestinian economy, and Hamas. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Qusayy Salih Darwish: "Appointments in Algerian </F>
Army To Strengthen Pro-Dialogue Trend"] 
  [Excerpts] President Liamine Zeroual has continued his 
series of changes within the Algerian Army. He has appointed 
Brigadier General Tayeb Darragi and Brigadier General Taghit as 
advisers at the Defense Ministry. The two were previously Army 
inspector generals. He also appointed Atiqi Lakhdar as chief of 
staff of the National Gendarmerie, replacing Brigadier General 
Ahmed Boustila, who was summoned for other duties. These 
appointments show that President Zeroual continues to appoint 
officers close to him to sensitive posts and to keep away 
officers opposed to his political line by giving them 
administrative posts as in the case of Brig. Gen. Taghit who is 
considered to be close to the trend opposed to dialogue. 
Furthermore, the removal of Boustila from the gendarmerie 
command will completely destroy what is left of the influence of 
Brigadier General Abbas Ghzayl who kept his post as Gendarmerie 
Commander at the last moment, after a decision had been made to 
dismiss him. Abbas Ghzayl's health is deteriorating and that 
will enable Atiqi Lakhdar to become the real commander of the 
National Gendarmerie which is very important to the regime as 
far as security is concerned. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, informed sources speak of sharp differences 
between the [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS] and the Armed 
Islamic Groups [GIA] following the assassination of the French 
priest and nun which was condemned by FIS and for which the GIA 
claimed responsibility. According to the same sources, the 
dialogue between the two stopped some time ago after the more 
extremist "Afghan" group assumed control within the GIA. As 
regards the dialouge with the authorities, FIS sources emphasize 
that Cheiks Ali Djeddi and Abdelqadir Boukhamkham were not 
allowed to visit Abbasi Madani and Ali Belhadj for consultation 
as agreed when they were released. As a result, contacts 
between the FIS leaders and the regime's officials were frozen.

  [Excerpts] Algiers, May 19 (MAP) -- The National Transition 
Council to act as a legislative body during the transition 
period in Algeria was officially instituted Wednesday. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Algerian dailies of this Thursday [19 May] have all 
commented on the president's speech noting that he had 
deliberately avoided to speak of dialog with all parties `with 
none of them debarred'. For the dailies, President Zeroual has 
thus definitely given up the carrying on of contacts with the 
leaders of the banned `Islamic Salvation Front' (FIS) to find a 
political solution to the Algerian crisis. 
  The National Transition Council is made up of 178 members 
including 12 women. The members are representing about 30 small 
political parties in addition to the moderate Islamist party 
`HAMAS' [Islamic Society Movement] (63 seats), state 
institutions (30 seats) and economic and social organisations 
(85 seats). 27 seats are still vacant in the prospect that they 
will be occupied by the major political parties such as the 
National Liberation Front (FLN/former single party), the Front 
of Socialist Forces (FFS of Hocine Ait Ahmed) and the Islamic 
Renaissance Movement (Ennahda) that decided to boycott the 
council.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 May (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak addressed an appeal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih today urging him to stop the fighting in Yemen in order to 
spare the blood of the Yemeni people and avert the squandering 
of that fraternal nation's resources in a civil war. 
  The president said that he continues to hope that his 
repeated appeals will find a sincere response and that peace 
will prevail in Yemen, especially in these blessed days in which 
Muslims are standing before God praying that He may grant them 
guidance, wisdom, security, and peace. 
  Following is the text of the president's appeal: 
  Like all other Arabs I have followed with great sadness and 
profound regret the fierce fighting in fraternal Yemen, which 
has been going on for nearly two weeks. This fighting is lethal 
to the sons of Yemen, is destroying the country's resources, and 
pitting the units of its armed forces against each other in a 
violent confrontation that cannot serve the Yemeni people's 
interests and objectives. 
  It is heart-rending to watch this bloody fighting that bodes 
an extensive civil war that will ruin the resources of an Arab 
homeland that sorely needs stability and security. The homeland 
needs to devote its energies to improving the life of its people. 
  It is especially sorrowful that this civil strife should 
come 
at a time when the Arab nation is attempting to heal the 
numerous wounds caused by the consequences of the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait and the Gulf war. 
  We were hoping that a new climate would arise in the Arab 
world, paving the way for a broad inter-Arab reconciliation, 
restoring inter-Arab solidarity, and reviving the hope of 
collective Arab action that will end the nation's current 
divisions. This is necessary if we want to face that challenges 
that will confront our Arab world at the beginning of the 21st 
century. 
  The civil strife in Yemen came abruptly, opening new wounds 
that would have been avoidable had the two parties begun a 
dialogue and agreed to reach an understanding on how to keep the 
armed forces outside the conflict. 
  We have done our utmost to prevent a clash between the two 
sides. Our only motive was to safeguard the supreme Arab 
interests. 
  We stressed the importance of avoiding armed clashes between 
the two sides and urged that their armed forces be separated so 
that war would not erupt. We expressed willingness to assist 
the two sides in settling their disputes without recourse to 
military force. We did this because we know that war never 
settles any dispute in a decisive or sound way. 
  It was never our aim to show bias to either party. 
  Our objective was to safeguard the interests of a fraternal 
people whose blood was mixed with the blood of Egyptians who 
defended the Yemeni people's right to live and make progress. 
Our objective was to save Yemeni unity from the risks of armed 
conflict and civil war that could finish off this unity and lead 
Yemen to fragmentation and rupture. Our objective was to save 
the resources of an Arab people from being wasted in fratricide, 
exhausting Yemen's resources and resulting in nothing but 
partition, bitterness, and severe loss for all parties. 
  It was our hope that our repeated appeals would find a 
sincere response from all parties, so that peace and security 
could prevail throughout Yemen during these blessed days when 
Muslim pilgrims stand on Mount 'Arafat to pray to God Almighty 
to grant them guidance, reason, peace, and security. 
  Now that the collision between troops from the two sides has 
entered a critical stage that portends a long war of attrition, 
I appeal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on this blessed day 
when pilgrims stand on Mount 'Arafat and in the name of the 
constitutional legitimacy binding him, to rise above 
differences. In the name of the unified Yemeni people who aspire 
to security and stability, in the name of the Yemeni unity that 
could be ruined by the war, and in the name of every Arab who 
looks forward to a wiser and more prudent Arab world, I appeal 
to him to end this fratricide and save Yemeni blood from being 
shed in vain in a war that is hard to justify. I appeal to him 
to order an immediate halt to the fighting, in order to save 
Yemen, its fraternal people, and the goal of unity, which is the 
aspiration of every Yemeni. The destiny of the homeland must be 
placed above any other consideration, because the homeland is 
the core and the basis. Individuals may come and go, but a 
homeland means immortality and survival. This is the hour when 
Yemen needs everyone to rise above their wounds. I pray to God 
Almighty to inspire us with reason and prudence, to lead us onto 
the right path, and to guide us as to what is best for our 
nation, for He is the best master and supporter.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the 
situation in Yemen is regrettable. He added that no good will 
come of the military action, either in the near or distant 
future. He noted that the situation of Yemen is still on the 
agenda of the Arab League, adding that the Arab League Council's 
emergency session is still in session. Everybody, he said, is 
following the developments and events there. 
  Regarding the Syrian-Israeli peace track, the foreign 
minister said that diplomatic action will continue in the coming 
days to narrow the differences between Syria and Israel. He 
pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
talks in Cairo showed that differences do exist between the two 
sides. The talks also showed the feasibility of continuing 
efforts to bridge the gap as much as possible, he added. 
  Answering a question on Egypt's stand on the situation in 
Somalia, Musa said that Egypt is ready to intervene once again 
to reconcile the parties in Somalia in view of Egypt's status, 
role, and connections in consolidating unity in Somalia. 
  [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1445 GMT on 19 May carries a 
further 
report on Musa's statement, which adds: 
  ["Asked about the disagreement between the Palestinians and 
Israelis over Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's remarks in 
Johannesburg in which he called for a jihad for the sake of 
Jerusalem, Musa said: There are many statements from both 
sides. The important thing, he added, is for these statements 
to serve what has been achieved and prepare the ground for the 
coming stages of negotiations between the two sides. He 
stressed that the Palestinian efforts, which we are all behind, 
must be directed toward giving momentum to a fruitful 
negotiation process to restore full Palestinian rights as part 
of the land for peace principle."]

  [Text] Cairo, 20 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
said today that Egypt and the EU countries have agreed to hold 
exploratory preliminary talks to enter a partnership agreement. 
  He added that the talks will involve studying a framework 
for 
new relations, especially as such frameworks have been defined 
between the EU and Israel and between the EU and Morocco and 
Tunisia. He noted that the political form of these frameworks 
is the same but their details differ according to each country 
and its interests and circumstances. 
  Musa said the framework will consider developments in Europe 
and the new concept of relations between the Mediterranean 
countries and Europe, between the Middle Eastern countries and 
Europe, and between Egypt and Europe.

  [Text] Khartoum, 19 May (MENA)--Egyptian Ambassador to 
Sudan Hasan Jad-al-Haq today lodged a strongly worded protest 
with the Sudanese Foreign Ministry following the Sudanese 
authorities' seizure and closure of Egyptian buildings and clubs 
in Khartoum. 
  The Sudanese authorities today seized the Egyptian Club in 
Khartoum and prevented its Sudanese and Egyptian members from 
entering. They also seized clubs and buildings belonging to the 
Egyptian Irrigation Authority in Sudan and the Egyptian military 
attache in Khartoum. 
  The Sudanese authorities gave no reasons for these measures. 
The measures began in December 1992, when the Sudanese 
authorities seized Egyptian education mission schools, the Cairo 
University branch in Khartoum, and the Egyptian Nasir's Club in 
the Sudanese capital.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 May (MENA)--The Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
last night summoned the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Cairo and 
informed him of its strong protest at the unacceptable and 
unjustified practices that primarily target Egyptian individuals 
and families living in Sudan. 
  The Foreign Ministry explained that these practices come on 
holy days, when Muslims everywhere celebrate the blessed 'Id 
al-Adha, when there is tranquility in Egyptian-Sudanese 
relations, and when Egypt has repeatedly stressed that it wants 
Sudan's territorial unity and its people's interests. 
  The Sudanese diplomat was informed that Egypt will find 
itself compelled to adopt the necessary measures and stances on 
the bilateral and international levels to confront this policy. 
  MENA has learned that the Foreign Ministry asked the 
Egyptian 
ambassador in Khartoum to lodge a similar protest and to explain 
the Egyptian stance on these practices in the same way the 
protest was conveyed to the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Cairo. 
  Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources have stated that both the 
Egyptian and Sudanese people feel regret and sadness over the 
Sudanese Government's continuation of its unfriendly policy, 
which aims to sever all ties and bonds between the two peoples 
and to draw a gloomy end to a long history of constructive 
cooperation and fruitful effort that served to deepen and 
consolidate everlasting bilateral relations. 
  The Egyptian sources stressed that despite the feelings of 
sorrow sparked by these unjustified Sudanese practices, the 
Egyptian Foreign Ministry emphasizes the following: 
  1. These measures will not affect the firm relations between 
the two fraternal Egyptian and Sudanese peoples because those 
who are carrying them out are a "minority"; they do not 
represent the Sudanese people and do not consider their 
traditions and real interests. 
  2. Egypt has always wanted to safeguard the interests of 
fraternal Sudan. It has expected the Sudanese Government to 
show the same level of responsibility. 
  3. Egypt hopes the Sudanese officials will reconsider their 
policy to safeguard their historic bilateral relations so that 
Egypt will not be compelled to adopt measures and a stance that 
so far, it has been eager not to take.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 May (MENA)--Official sources of Egypt's 
political parties across the political spectrum have denied 
allegations that they have declared their solidarity with the 
Egyptian Lawyers Association in connection with the events of 
the past two days. 
  The sources, speaking for the leaders of the political 
parties, denied issuing a statement attributed to them earlier 
today. The sources said it is really frightening that some 
people can go to such lengths, fabricate statements, and falsely 
attribute actions to political parties that are carrying out 
their roles and performing their responsibilities with total 
freedom within our current system of democracy. 
  Several political party leaders have exposed the facts about 
the "alleged statement". They said that a few lawyers, with 
well-known sympathies and linked to illegal groups, issued this 
statement and attributed it to the political parties. 
  The leaders affirmed that the entire statement is a mere 
calumny that contradicts the facts.

  [Text] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under 
secretary and director of the President's Office for Political 
Affairs, has denied that the Gulf states are helping the 
extremist groups in Egypt. He stressed that the Gulf countries 
know that any harm to Egypt's security will bring harm to them. 
  Speaking at a seminar at the Education College in Port Said, 
al-Baz noted that any outside military intervention in Yemen 
will further complicate the crisis. He stressed that Egypt will 
not intervene militarily in Yemen but will hold intensive 
political and diplomatic contacts to end the conflict. Al-Baz 
cautioned against conflicts among Arab states. He noted that 
such conflicts would give a bad impression of the Arab nation 
worldwide. 
  Al-Baz pointed out that the notion of a Middle East market 
was first raised by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. He 
pointed out that before establishing a Middle East market, an 
Arab world must be established first.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 May (MENA)--The Egyptian security service 
has succeeded in bringing back a key terrorist from Pakistan, 
who is wanted in the Vanguards of Conquest case. 
  The Pakistani security authorities have apprehended 
terrorist 
'Ali 'Id Muhammad and deported him to Egypt. He was detained 
today by Cairo airport authorities upon his arrival under heavy 
guard on an Egyptian plane from Karachi. 
  According to preliminary information, the terrorist left 
Cairo in 1990 and settled in Peshawar until he was arrested in 
Karachi last Saturday. The arrest of the terrorist falls within 
Interpol's jurisdiction to arrest Arab Afghans after the 
expiration of the Afghan Government's deadline for them to leave 
the country.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA)--The Swiss Government has 
decided to write off 150 million Swiss francs--230 million 
Egyptian pounds--of Egypt's debts to Switzerland. 
  Dr. Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, minister of state for international 
cooperation, made this statement today after a meeting with Mr. 
Kelin Berger, Swiss minister of state for foreign affairs [name 
and title as received]. 
  Dr. Butrus-Ghali said the terms of the agreement included 
spending the equivalent of this amount on development projects 
to create additional job opportunities, and to develop projects 
that would contribute toward decreasing the burden of economic 
reform on the low-income sector.

<F P=106> [By Henri Mamarbachi] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 19 (AFP) -- Foreigners desperate to 
escape Aden crowded the docks in the baking sun Thursday [19 
May], as the rival Yemeni armies battled their way into a third 
week of civil war. 
  The struggle between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
northern troops and those of his southern rival Vice President 
'Ali Salim al-Bid was concentrated for the fourth day running on 
al-'Anad, a giant air base 60 kilometres (36 miles) north of 
here. 
  An AFP correspondent reported that al-Bid's troops were 
defending the base from its southern perimetre against 
onslaughts from northern rivals on the other side in a battle 
which has become the focal point of the war. 
  There were heavy artillery exchanges around the base and in 
nearby mountains and automatic weapons fire could be heard from 
inside. 
  Aid workers also reported heavy fighting further east at 
Abyan, where around 100 wounded were admitted to hospitals on 
Thursday alone. 
  Foreigners still stranded in al-Bid's stronghold Aden 
flocked 
to the docks desperate for a boat passage out, with all roads to 
the north blocked and the airport closed. About 300 arrived 
early to complete lengthy customs regulations. 
  One group was trying to get aboard a Russian ship ready to 
set off, and the others had been impatiently waiting since the 
beginning of the week for an Indian boat to unload its cargo of 
corn. 
  "Each morning we come here, we wait and in the evening we 
return to our hotel," one of them said. 
  The Russian consul and his Chinese counterpart, the only two 
diplomats still remaining in the city, were trying to process 
their nationals as the temperature climbed to 40 degrees Celsius 
(104 degrees Fahrenheit). 
  A Belgian businessman, known to everyone just as Patrick, 
was 
trying to deal with all the other foreign nationals, mainly 
Indians, Americans, Iranians and Belgians as well as a few 
Yemenis. 
  The fighting around Aden was jeopardising plans to send a UN 
relief convoy to Somali refugees trapped in crossfire at the 
al-Kawd camp on a beach near Zinjibar, 50 kilometers (32 miles) 
northeast of the city. 
  Rolf Guldberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
representative in Sanaa, said the camp was in a "war zone" and 
supplies would only be sent once fighting eased. He hoped it 
would set off from Sanaa in the next few days. 
  The United Nations had no precise figure on the total number 
of Somali refugees or casualties but would be trying to provide 
food for 4,000, the estimated number there before the Yemeni 
civil began on May 5. 
  The refugees say hundreds have died in the crossfire. 
  The Somalis fled to Yemen to escape the civil war which 
erupted in their Horn of Africa country three years ago, but 
have now found themselves caught up in a new conflict. 
  Hundreds of refugees meanwhile flooded into Aden fleeing 
fighting in the surrounding mountains and countryside. 
  The United Nations said there were at least 1,500 in Aden, 
and it was providing them with food. 
  Meanwhile, a senior official from the International 
Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) said they had already started to visit 
prisoner of war camps, and hoped to complete the inspections 
next week. 
  Arnold Luethold, regional ICRC director for the Arabian 
peninsula, gave no precise figure for war casualties or 
internees but said they had counted hundreds of POWs.

  [Text] Aden, May 20 (AFP)--Two ground-to-ground SCUD 
missiles ripped into the southern Yemeni capital Aden late 
Thursday [19 May], injuring four people, according to hospital 
sources, in the first missile strike on the city since civil war 
broke out on May 5. 
  One of the missiles hit the airport and the other landed in 
a 
residential area in the northeast of the city. 
  A spokesman for the city's main al-Thawrah hospital said the 
four casualties it had received had been hurt in the attack on 
the airport, adding that the injured from the other attack had 
not yet been brought in for treatment. 
  The attacks triggered panic in the southern suburbs, as 
residents took shelter on the lower floors and in the stairwells 
of apartment blocks, an AFP correspondent on the scene said. 
  Deputy tourism Minister Yahya 'Abd-al-Qawi, a senior 
official 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party, the main political force in the 
south, told AFP a missile had hit the hulk of a Soviet-era 
Antonov transport plane standing well away from the main runways. 
  'Abd-al-Qawi, who had visited the scene, said he was not 
sure 
if anybody had been injured in the strike. 
  Fire broke out in the area, and the plume of smoke could be 
seen from the nearby hotel where most of the Western journalists 
covering the civil war are staying. Soldiers turned backed 
journalists who tried to get to the scene. 
  Witnesses said the al-Badr barracks, where Aden's 
anti-aircraft battery crews are garrisoned, as well as the Aden 
peninsula, where the officers club is situated, had been hit, 
although it was not known if the club itself had been damaged. 
  The second missile slammed into the Jabal Shams residential 
district, 'Abd-al-Qawi said, without giving further details. 
  Ambulances and fire engines were still coming and going one 
hour after the attacks. 
  Northern troops consolidated their positions to the north of 
the city with firefights and hand-to-hand fighting Thursday, 
casualties said. 
  They have been tightening the noose around the city since 
they took the main al-'Anad airbase some 50 kilometres (30 
miles) to the north on Monday. 
  On the eastern front, mortar shells fell Thursday on the 
first control post on the outskirts of the city, some 10 
kilometres (six miles) from the city centre, journalists said. 
  A southern source said the policy-making bodies of the 
Yemeni 
Socialist Party were meeting Thursday evening to finalise plans 
to set up a High Council of National Salvation, which he said 
would function as a kind of government. 
  The idea was floated after the fall of al-'Anad on Monday, 
when 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, who heads a bloc of five 
opposition parties, said the council would function wherever it 
had influence, and would not constitute a government of South 
Yemen. 
  Conservative North Yemen and the formerly Marxist South 
Yemen 
merged in May 1990 to form a new republic, but their armies were 
never integrated, and Vice-President Salim al-Bid, a southerner, 
left the joint capital Sanaa last August for Aden, complaining 
of inadequate power-sharing. 
  A well-informed southern source said Thursday that al-Bid 
left Aden two days ago for Hadramut province near the Omani 
border, some 600 kilometres (372 miles). 
  The northerners have demanded that al-Bid surrender and 
stand 
trial for treason.

  [Text] A military source at the Ministry of Defense has 
stated that Armed Forces' units continued their advance 
yesterday along the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, crossed all 
barriers, and confronted air sorties by the forces of apostasy 
and secession. The air defenses forced the aircraft to retreat 
and flee, downing one aircraft over the al-'Anad airport. 
  The forces of unity, democracy, and the protection of 
Constitutional legitimacy managed to seize 62 T-55 tanks in the 
mountainous paths outside the al-'Anad base, several kilometers 
away on the southern front between al-Hawtah and the al-'Anad 
base, after these tanks managed to flee the base the day before 
yesterday. These tanks were seized by the fist of legitimacy and 
the hands of our courageous and devoted forces. Our forces also 
managed to seize one 130-mm Howitzer gun battalion during the 
units' advance from the al-'Anad base toward the town of 
al-Hawtah. 
  On the Abyan-Aden axis, the valiant Armed Forces' units 
continued their advance, and completed the tight siege of the 
set targets, from the eastern and northern sides of Aden, after 
inflicting great losses on the gangs of the rebellious 
secessionist forces and forcing them to retreat toward the final 
places of suffocation. 
  The eagles of the air in the Air Force carried out the 
missions assigned to them in their combat sorties, and scored 
direct and destructive hits against the set military targets in 
a number of collapsing dens of the rebellious secessionist 
forces. 
  Judging from the outcome of the field confrontation of the 
forces of apostasy and secession, all field, psychological, and 
moral signs about the rebellious gangs of the secessionists 
confirm the extent of the grave disappointment and the feelings 
of disgrace and bitter frustration overwhelming the 
secessionists and guiding their interpretations and rancorous 
conduct toward both themselves and all those surrounding them. 
This is also revealed by the secessionists' despicable cries 
and their distorted and desperate media statements. 
  In another development, the military source said there is a 
daily increase in the numbers of officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and soldiers, misled by the gang of rebellion and 
secession in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party's leadership, who are 
joining our valiant Armed Forces, the forces that protect unity 
and champion both Constitutional legitimacy and democracy, after 
seeing the real infernal scheme to which they were pushed by the 
secessionist gang. This scheme leads to death and to the furnace 
of a losing war. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that 250 
officers, 
noncommissioned officers, and soldiers from the remaining 
elements of the 'Abbud Brigade, who fled from the al-Dali' 
District, returned to the district and joined the forces of 
unity and legitimacy stationed in al-Dali' District. They 
expressed their denunciation of the hideous crime committed by 
the secessionist gang by initiating war in the homeland and 
pushing the sons of the Armed Forces and the comrades in arms 
into the furnace of bloody fighting. They also asserted their 
readiness to carry out the national duty in the ranks that 
champion unity and legitimacy. They were welcomed by their 
colleagues in our Armed Forces, the forces of unity and 
legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Military Communique No. 23 issued by the Defense Ministry] </F>
  [Text] Our heroic armed forces continued their operations 
with high morale yesterday and today. They succeeded in foiling 
repeated assaults by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang, and 
delivered deadly blows to those forces in the depths of their 
defensive positions, with the help of almighty God and by virtue 
of the determination of the fighters, who arise from the just 
cause they are defending and their certainty of winning a clear 
victory. 
  As this military communique was being written, our forces 
were delivering crushing blows to the hostile forces in the area 
around Kirsh, inflicting vast casualties, and forcing them to 
retreat and surrender. On the Abyan axis, our heroic forces are 
continuing their pursuit of remnants of hostile forces, and are 
mopping up the remaining pockets of resistance. 
  This morning our forces foiled every desperate assault made 
by units from the scattered hostile forces. Our forces 
inflicted major defeats on these forces, to the satisfaction of 
our heroic fighters and the good and loyal inhabitants of Abyan, 
who face the prospect of certain victory in this destructive war 
-- unleashed against our people in the southern governorates by 
the bloody, fascist al-Ahmar gang.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, today visited the al-Nasr Camp. He was received by the 
brother camp commander, officers, NCO's, and soldiers. The 
brother chairman, the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was 
briefed on the progress of training and preparation at the camp. 
  Addressing the brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers, the 
brother chairman praised the valiant Armed Forces' heroic role 
to support the people's will and defend the homeland and 
democracy against all threats and challenges that have been 
imposed by the rebellious, secessionist gang in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party's [YSP] leadership which threw the homeland and 
the Armed Forces into the furnace of war and imposed it on our 
people in order to implement its secessionist plan and fragment 
the homeland. 
  He stressed: Unity has existed to survive and to be 
entrenched in the state of affairs and life of the homeland. It 
is our people's destiny and fate, and they will never relinquish 
it. He noted that our people and their Armed Forces, who 
offered dear sacrifices for the sake of the Yemeni revolutions 
of 26 September and 14 October, and for their triumph, are today 
making sacrifices for the sake of protecting and entrenching 
unity. He stressed that Yemen will have no future or stability 
without unity, and that secession and the attempts to go back to 
the pre-22 May 1990 era are impossible. He said that the people 
and their Armed Forces will not allow this and will confront the 
secessionists resolutely and strongly. 
  The brother president pointed to what is being achieved by 
our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity, legitimacy, and 
democracy, in terms of success in accomplishing their tasks and 
national duties to deter the rebelling, secessionist forces, to 
abort their secessionist plan, and to force them to submit to 
the will of the people and to recognize constitutional 
legitimacy. He pointed out that this is taking place thanks to 
God and to our Yemeni people's support, who are rallying around 
their valiant Armed Forces throughout the Yemeni homeland in 
Shabwah, Abyan, Aden, Ta'izz, Hadhramaut, al-Mahrah, Sa'dah, 
Hajjah, al-Hudaydah, Sanaa, and Dhamar. 
  The brother chairman of the Presidential Council called on 
the personnel who were misled by the rebelling, secessionist 
gang in the YSP leadership to join the ranks of their brothers 
and comrades-in-arms in the Armed Forces in order to prove their 
patriotism and faithfulness to the homeland by standing in the 
trench of unity, revolution, and democracy. He wondered whether 
these misled people want to fight and die for the sake of a 
handful of conspiratorial secessionists who led the homeland to 
this abyss for the sake of achieving personal interests and 
devastating selfish whims. He added: To those misled people we 
say, you are now facing a test, either you join the ranks of 
right or the ranks of falsehood. It is either you be with your 
people, homeland, and unity, or with a handful of conspirators 
who did not fear God in their actions against the homeland and 
people, and involved the sons of the one homeland and the 
comrades-in-arms in the Armed Forces in this bloody fighting 
which they did not want. However, this criminal gang has 
imposed it on our Yemeni people and the Armed Forces. 
  He noted that our Yemeni people are proud of their sons in 
the Armed Forces, who are now waging the battle of honor and 
martyrdom in defense of unity and democracy, and to eliminate 
the threats and dangers posed by the rebelling, secessionist 
gang. 
  The brother president urged the brother soldiers, NCO's, and 
officers to be alert, disciplined, and ready to perform the 
sacred national duty at all times and under all circumstances. 
  The brother president, the supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, was accompanied by brother Staff Colonel 'Ali Muhammad 
Salah, deputy chief of staff for operations.

  [Text] The brother members of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
Political Bureau are currently paying field visits to a number 
of battlefronts, and to the leadership of the forces defending 
unity, democracy, and modernization, which are pursuing the 
forces of the al-Ahmar clan's gang [words indistinct]. 
  The Yemeni news agency, SABA', has learned that the visits 
by 
the brother members of the political bureau to the battlefront 
are being made in order to implement a recently made decision by 
that same organization. The soldiers of the units defending 
unity and democracy have expressed great satisfaction and 
appreciation concerning these visits, and with this wise and 
sincere decision made during these hard times, which were 
brought about by the criminal and oppressive war imposed on the 
Yemeni people by the bloody al-Ahmar gang, which has turned the 
southern and eastern governorates into their battlefields.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad </F>
Basindwah by correspondent Yusuf al-Sharif; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sharif] I held a long dialogue with Yemeni 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah on the massive disaster 
besetting his country and its unitary experiment, which is 
facing a difficult test. Indeed, the dialogue was interrupted 
by telephone conversations with the military command, the 
Foreign Ministry, and Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil in 
Sanaa to follow up on the raging battles in Yemen and their 
domestic and foreign repercussions. 
  After war broke out between the forces of what were two 
parts 
of the country, why did President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih turn down 
the Arab mediation offers to contain the deteriorating situation 
in Yemen and the Arab League's offer to send forces to disengage 
the two warring factions? 
  [Basindwah] Let me first explain the situation. When 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid secluded himself in Aden in the middle of August, 
we accepted all national, Arab, and international mediation 
offers to persuade him to return to perform his duties in Sanaa. 
We even accepted all his personal conditions to return and 
agreed on all the proposals and formulas proposed by the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] to resolve the political crisis. 
President Salih and the People's Congress agreed without 
reservation because our main objective was to preserve the 
Yemeni unity for which the people struggled. Since unity was 
established in May 1990 the YSP leadership has continued its 
political pressure and blackmail to gain more posts, influence, 
and funds. Despite this, our response was immediate, 
appreciating the YSP's choice of merger, its ceding leadership 
in the south after 23 years of rule, and because we wanted the 
unity process to continue as it started, with the integration of 
the unified political will of the People's Congress and the YSP. 
Regrettably, despite the success in merging the official 
state's institutions in both parts of Yemen, the YSP continued 
for four years to place obstacles before the merger of the Armed 
Forces, although the General Command of the Northern and 
Southern Armed Forces and the post of defense minister were 
given to the YSP so that it might not evade responsibility or 
claim that the merger was hindered by the People's Congress 
during and after the transitional stage. The YSP hindered the 
merging of the two Armed Forces so that it would remain in 
control of the command of the Southern Forces and use this card 
to blackmail, pressure, and terrorize anyone who rejected total 
obedience in the provinces of the South, as was the case when it 
ruled the South. 
  [Al-Sharif] Do you believe that the continuing separation of 
the Armed Forces was the main factor behind the political crisis 
and its aggravation? 
  [Basindwah] In the pluralistic democratic formula that the 
YSP called for as a framework for unity, it was politically 
unacceptable to remain a partner in the government with 
sovereignty and legislative and executive powers and at the same 
time play the role of opposition to the constitutional and 
legitimate regime of the unified state. Logically, it had to 
choose between siding with the government or the opposition. 
But al-Bid chose a duplicitous stance and rejected all the 
solutions put forward by the mediators to heal the rift and ease 
the political crisis through dialogue with President Salih or 
between the two parties or among the tripartite ruling coalition 
that includes the Reform Grouping. From his seclusion in Aden, 
he persisted in increasing the differences. The People's 
Congress called for a comprehensive national dialogue on the 
causes of the crisis and its negative repercussions and to find 
a way to emerge from the labyrinth created by the YSP. The 
participants in the dialogue worked out the Pledge and Accord 
Document with the participation of all parties in the government 
and opposition and public figures. I would like to ask you if 
al-Bid returned to Sanaa to take the constitutional oath as vice 
president, for which the agreement in Amman provides. Why have 
the YSP ministers and deputies retrenched in Aden? What is 
their goal and purpose? 
  [Al-Sharif] I am afraid I cannot answer that question; the 
Yemenis know more about their affairs than anybody else. 
  [Basindwah] They leaked their intention to return to the 
days 
of partition three and a half years after the establishment of 
unity, in an unexpected statement by Salim Salih, the YSP's 
assistant secretary general. Salih dropped a bombshell by 
proposing federation as a substitute to merger unity. They 
threatened that if we reject federation, we may regret it later 
on. Naturally we rejected it because unity came to rectify an 
error and handle conspiracies that were not created by the 
Yemeni people. Unity also affirmed a fact that was known on the 
ground and in the history books, namely, that we are one people. 
It was not a unity between two peoples, two parties, and two 
countries, as was the case in the unity between Egypt and Syria. 
You know that throughout Yemen the entire people, even 
simple-minded people, refused to refer to the North and South 
before the establishment of unity. We used to say the southern 
part and the northern part. 
  [Al-Sharif] We are past this stage now. In the absence of 
reason and dialogue, the military option has triumphed over the 
political options that were always available, even in the 
darkest moments. Egypt has been a major partner in supporting 
the 26 September revolution in the North and 14 October in the 
South. It has sacrificed thousands of its best men and supplied 
Yemenis with weapons, which we imported with our own money, and 
technical experts to modernize Yemen so that it could restore 
its past glory. On this basis, we have a right to ask: Why did 
you get involved in the military option? 
  [Basindwah] It is my right and duty to admit with pride and 
honor Egypt's military, political, and cultural role. Were it 
not for this role, the fate of our revolution would have been 
similar to earlier revolutions and uprisings in Yemen, which 
were wiped out after a few weeks or days, simply because our 
Arab brothers ignored our legitimate humanitarian desire for 
liberation and freedom. But what do you have to say about the 
Scuds that the YSP troops are now firing at random against 
Sanaa, Ta'izz, and Dhamar? Is the murder of dozens of 
defenseless civilians and the destruction of homes and vital 
installations the practical embodiment of the plan of the 
cultural modernization of the unified state of Yemen, about 
which the YSP leadership has been bragging? 
  [Al-Sharif] Didn't the Northern Army carry out similar 
military operations against civilians in Aden and other Southern 
governorates? 
  [Basindwah] We challenge the YSP to prove any military act 
committed by the Armed Forces of the unified state against 
civilians. These were the strict orders of President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih in his capacity as the supreme commander. I 
would like to correct many of the mistakes persistently made by 
the media organs of the YSP and the external forces that support 
its conspiracy with regard to the military plan to extend the 
authority of the constitutional legitimacy of the state of unity 
throughout the country. This plan does not place the seizure of 
Aden at the head of its priorities; it merely seeks, in what I 
am at liberty to say, to lay siege to its approaches, exit 
points, and roads leading to it. As for the collapse of the 
secessionist clique in the YSP, which is fortifying itself 
inside Aden, this is the job and responsibility of the people 
and the unionist leaders and elements in the YSP and its Armed 
Forces. Our wager is on the people's adherence to unity and on 
the suffering and oppression that have pained them under the 
fascist and totalitarian rule of the Southern part. 
  [Al-Sharif] We have not settled the issue of who is 
responsible for starting the fighting and choosing the military 
option. 
  [Basindwah] The conspiracy scenario began to be implemented 
immediately after the Pledge and Accord Document was signed in 
Amman. We were surprised by a ferocious attack by the YSP's 
Armed Forces on the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which was stationed in 
the Abyan area in the Southern governorates. The attack failed. 
The president, who is also supreme commander, made a strenuous 
effort to contain the military crisis provoked by the YSP's 
separatist leaders. They provoked it after their political 
efforts to repartition the country failed. Several days later 
they provoked another military clash in the Harf area in the 
Northern governorates and failed again. They repeated these 
military tactics near Shabwah's oil fields in the Southern 
governorates. These battles were limited to offensive action by 
their side and moves to repulse them by the legitimate forces. 
Earlier it was possible to contain any attempts to expand the 
fighting and handle the issue by political methods, regarding 
what had happened as a mere escalation of tension. This 
situation continued until the YSP forces carried out an all-out 
offensive in the 'Imran area. It was a criminal, separatist, 
premeditated attack. 
  [Al-Sharif] The reports on who began the fighting in 'Imran 
were conflicting. 
  [Basindwah] Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Yemeni 
military committee that includes Jordanian and Omani officers 
and the U.S. and French military attaches was carrying out its 
duties in the 'Imran camp at the time. This committee is more 
competent and reliable than other parties in giving testimony 
and pointing an accusing finger at the guilty side. The 
committee members had a miraculous escape when fighting erupted 
between the 2d Armored Brigade, which receives its orders from 
the YSP separatists, and a brigade serving under the legitimate 
command. The 2d Brigade's commander fired several shots as a 
sign to begin the fighting. The brigade under the legitimate 
command took no heed and refused to fire back. Mujahid 
al-Kahhali, a reserve officer who leads a so- called corrective 
movement and who was in the camp without having official 
business there, detonated a highly explosive charge. This 
caused confusion and the two brigades clashed, destroying each 
other in hours. The military committee could not contain the 
situation. The president immediately visited the wounded from 
both brigades and supervised the aerial transfer of seriously 
wounded troops to a medical center in Jordan. He announced that 
the wounded troops from both sides were Yemenis and that their 
plight pained the entire nation. He said the dead troops were 
martyrs of a united Yemen and ordered compensation of 20,000 
rials for every dead officer of the YSP brigade and 10,000 rials 
for every dead soldier. He also ordered that new weapons and 
ammunition be issued to those who survived, giving them leave 
from duty until after the 'Id al-Adha feast. But the 
premeditated political crisis resurfaced in the Dhamar area. A 
YSP commander ordered the units of the Ba Suhayb Brigade to 
deploy outside the camp with their tanks and large and 
medium-caliber guns. This was a blatant violation of the 
agreement reached within the military committee and constituted 
disobedience of the orders issued by Staff Brigadier General 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, defense minister, commander of the Armed 
Forces, and a YSP official. The brigade commander subjected the 
city of Dhamar to tension and apprehension. I carried out 
several contacts with the defense minister in Aden--most YSP 
ministers were by now living there until the situation cleared 
up--but his brother the commander of the Ba Suhayb Brigade 
maintained his attitude and insisted on deploying outside the 
camp. At 2010 on a Wednesday evening two weeks ago we were with 
the president at the Presidential Palace in Sanaa when he 
received an urgent telephone call from the Army General Command 
reporting that the brigade had opened fire on a Republican Guard 
battalion stationed on the other side of Dhamar and that the 
city's main electric power plant had been destroyed. The 
president, in his capacity as supreme commander, issued an order 
to both sides to observe a cease-fire. He also ordered the 
Republican Guard battalion not to return the brigade's fire but 
to take precautionary measures. 
  [Al-Sharif] Information has it that the Ba Suhayb Brigade 
observed the cease-fire. 
  [Basindwah] Yes. The two sides observed the cease-fire for a 
short time. But 45 minutes later a ferocious attack with tanks, 
armored vehicles, and artillery was launched against 1,200 
officers and men of the Central Security Forces in Aden who 
carried only light weapons. This was a brutal act of 
extermination in full view of the public. The YSP forces 
launched a second brutal offensive against an armored brigade 
under legitimate command in the Radfan area. The situation 
erupted and it became impossible to control the synchronized 
attacks in most areas, all of which were part of the separatist 
conspiracy. Some YSP forces joined the legitimate forces, other 
YSP forces fled, and some are still fighting. No one is saying 
this side won and that side was defeated. All are Yemenis and 
the loss is the entire country's loss. It is difficult to 
replace troops and weapons. 
  [Al-Sharif] Don't you think the president has the necessary 
powers as supreme commander to order a cease-fire so as to avoid 
further casualties and destruction and before the fighting turns 
into a full-scale North-South civil war? Some enemies of Yemen 
would like to attribute a sectarian nature to this strife, 
saying that it is a conflict between the [Shiite] Zaydi tribes 
and the [Sunni] Shafi'ites. 
  [Basindwah] Civil war always occurs between two groups of 
the 
same nation or even between two sects. This is what Yemen's 
enemies hope for. But Yemen is united now in a state made 
legitimate by popular referendum. The people were unanimous in 
choosing unity and a single constitution. I believe things will 
return to normal in a few days, that the conspiracy will fail, 
and that those who plotted against unity and constitutional 
legitimacy will stand trial. 
  [Al-Sharif] What is the aim of your diplomatic tour, which 
began in Cairo and took in Jordan, Syria, and the Gulf 
countries, after the president rejected mediation and turned 
down the Arab League's offer to send Arab forces to disengage 
the two warring sides? 
  [Basindwah] Arab and foreign mediation was required during 
the political crisis when the YSP was keeping its conspiracy 
against unity, constitutional legitimacy, and the elected 
government under wraps. Mediation now should focus on 
persuading the rebellious conspiring group to accept the 
legitimate authority and listen to the call of reason and 
democracy. This is why the government has declared that what is 
happening is a domestic Yemeni affair. Those who wish to carry 
out good offices must help us to control the situation and 
preserve the country's unity. They must not deal with those 
officials who have lost their legal status. 
  [Al-Sharif] I would like to remind you of Yemen's position 
during the Gulf crisis. Yemen urged an inter-Arab solution. 
  [Basindwah] Yes, that was our position. We still want an 
Arab solution that will defend constitutional legitimacy, 
maintain our unity and sovereignty, and safeguard our nation. 
This is why we turned down the offer to have Arab forces sent 
to us, because what is happening--as I said--is an internal 
Yemeni affair. The disengagement of forces would mean 
recognizing the separatist rebels as an independent entity. We 
have responded to every mediation effort and agreed to make 
every possible concession. But the conspirators have always 
backed down and refused to implement the agreements. They 
insisted on the return of the YSP forces to the South and the 
return of the legitimate forces to the North. This was an 
introduction to their declared secession. We knew of this 
conspiracy from the beginning. We rejected it politically. 
They tried then to make it a fact by military secession. 
  [Al-Sharif] Does this mean the abolition or dissolution of 
the YSP? 
  [Basindwah] Certainly not, because Yemen has chosen 
democracy 
and pluralism. We are discussing a conspiratorial and 
secessionist group. But this does not mean the YSP leadership 
has no elements who support unity, adhere to legitimacy, reject 
hegemony, and believe in democracy. The decision to dismiss the 
vice president was adopted with the unanimous legal vote of the 
House of Representatives, including YSP representatives. The 
same applies to the dismissal of Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, who suddenly and without the permission of the 
president traveled to the United States, where he spent four 
days in hospital on the pretext of receiving treatment. He and 
his entire family are now enjoying themselves in the parks of 
Florida. The same goes for the dismissal of the Aden governor 
and the defense minister, who are the heads of the sedition. As 
for the dismissal of the petroleum minister, he is accused of 
stealing over $350 million in oil royalties. These dismissed 
officials will be replaced by other honest YSP elements. 
  [Al-Sharif] The telephone rang and the Yemeni foreign 
minister lifted the headset and started a long conversation with 
the General Command in Sanaa, the Foreign Ministry, and the 
Interior Ministry. He asked about the military situation, 
affirming that his meeting with President Husni Mubarak was 
positive and that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry constantly 
briefs him on the current situation in Yemen. I asked him if I 
could speak with Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil. I asked 
al-Mutawakkil about the widespread rumors of the arrests of YSP 
officials in North Yemen. Al-Mutawakkil said: These are 
seditious rumors by the YSP. Only very few people were arrested 
to secure the rear of the legitimate forces when accusations of 
provocation and political mobilization were proved against them. 
Among those arrested is 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Saqqaf, chief editor 
of the YEMEN TIMES, who published seditious and alarming 
statements that 12,000 people were killed in the fighting, while 
news agency correspondents and the statements issued in Aden and 
Sanaa put the dead in the hundreds. Al-Mutawakkil said: We 
hope to end the state of emergency once the fighting stops and 
the constitutional legitimate authority imposes its authority 
throughout Yemen. The overall security situation is reassuring. 
The indiscriminate shelling of Sanaa and Ta'izz by Scud 
missiles has alarmed the people but has increased their 
determination to confront those who rebel against unity and 
those who plot against constitutional legitimacy. 
  I asked Basindwah about the course of the fighting in light 
of his conversation with the General Command in Sanaa. 
  [Basindwah] The legitimate forces are now besieging Aden at 
Dar Sa'd near the Shaykh 'Uthman quarter and at al-'Alam and 
al-'Anad, 50 km from Aden. The fall of Aden is a matter of 
time, because we want to preserve the life of the inhabitants 
and the vital installations. 
  [Al-Sharif] And what about foreign reaction to the events in 
Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] Diplomatic and security reports indicate that 
ships have arrived at Aden and Diya' al-Mukalla carrying weapons 
from particular states. 
  [Al-Sharif] Which states? 
  [Basindwah] We refuse to accuse anyone until we have 
tangible 
evidence. Generally speaking, the YSP has received arms 
consignments from East countries, including Bulgaria. These 
weapons were paid for from the $250 million in the Treasury of 
the Southern part before the days of unity. 
  [Al-Sharif] We are afraid that rumors and misleading reports 
leaked to Sanaa and Aden are designed to worsen the military 
situation. 
  [Basindwah] Can we deny that a consignment was seized in al- 
Hudaybah before the fighting started? The consignment contained 
military communications equipment and listening devices. From 
where did they bring the money? That is the question. 
  [Al-Sharif] In a statement to a London-based Arab 
television station during the political crisis, President Salih 
said some sides paid to create the crisis. 
  [Basindwah] But he refused to name the sides that pay. 
  [Al-Sharif] Reportedly, Sudanese and Iraqis are fighting 
alongside the forces of legitimacy. 
  [Basindwah] I will tell you of an incident showing the 
failure of the tendentious YSP propaganda: Nasir al-Sabili, the 
dismissed governor of Aden, announced the arrest of a group of 
people affiliated with the Egyptian al-Jihad organization and 
claimed that the General People's Congress objected to their 
extradition to Egypt. Egyptian Ambassador in Sanaa 'Ata Harun 
was contacted and he assigned the Egyptian consul to 
investigate. Meanwhile, the interior minister officially 
ordered the Aden governor to hand over the detained group to the 
Egyptian security authorities without any conditions or 
restrictions. But in Aden, the Egyptian consul discovered that 
the whole issue was a fabrication and that no arrests had been 
made. This is how the YSP uses its propaganda to incite the 
world against the legitimate authority. We challenge them to 
produce one Sudanese or Iraqi fighting within the ranks of the 
legitimate forces. 
  This fact was confirmed by Ambassador Badr Hammam, Egypt's 
envoy to Yemen, during the political crisis. In my meeting with 
President Husni Mubarak to explain the situation in Yemen, 
Ambassador Hammam testified that Sanaa is innocent of those 
accusations. Similar rumors were disseminated during the Gulf 
war, with fabricated reports that Iraqi planes sought shelter in 
Yemen. Regrettably, the other day I read an article by an 
Egyptian writer claiming that 50,000 Iraqis remained in Yemen 
after the Gulf war and are now fighting against the forces of 
the YSP. What are foreign embassies and news agency 
correspondents doing in Yemen? Have they said anything to 
support these allegations? We must wonder about the motives and 
the mission of Salim Salih [a YSP official], who arrived in 
London before the military action and who is still there. And we 
must ask what Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas is doing in the United 
States. He said his mission was to try to get a cease-fire. So, 
did he know the YSP would soon ignite the war? 
  [Al-Sharif] The YSP has accused the constitutional 
government 
of importing chemical and biological weapons before the war 
broke out. 
  [Basindwah] This accusation deserves no response because it 
denies itself by itself. If it had been true, the United States 
would have announced it and imposed international sanctions on 
us. 
  [Al-Sharif] By the way, how do you assess the U.S. position 
toward the disaster of the fighting in Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] The United States has announced that it is eager 
for Yemeni unity, not out of fear for its economic and strategic 
interests in Yemen, because these are safe, but because it is no 
longer in conflict with any other superpower now that the Soviet 
Union has collapsed and the Cold War and the policy of 
polarization have ended. The United States believes that unity 
is a factor of stability, security, and peace in the Arabian 
Peninsula. Divisions have always been a cause of tension and 
unrest. The Americans praised and valued our options for 
democracy and pluralism and they sent a high-ranking official to 
congratulate Yemen on successfully emerging from the experience 
of free and peaceful elections. In the oilfields, U.S. 
companies are continuing their activity, digging, building 
pipelines, and exporting oil regularly and efficiently. This 
perhaps explains our reassurance that the United States remains 
concerned about Yemeni unity. 
  [Al-Sharif] But statements by the U.S. assistant secretary 
of 
state, which he made in the Gulf after his visit to Yemen and 
the eruption of fighting there, were interpreted by some 
observers as a change in the U.S. position toward unity. 
  [Basindwah] He only answered correspondents' questions 
following his visit to Yemen. His answers were his personal 
interpretation of the progress of military operations and he did 
not commit the U.S. Government to them. Naturally, some 
observers are optimists, others are pessimists; some are 
realistic and credible in their analyses while others are not.

  [Text] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the 
Presidential Council, today received brother (Muhammad 'Ali 
Bila), ambassador of the State of Eritrea in Sanaa, at the end 
of his tour of duty in our country. 
  The ambassador expressed his country's support for Yemen's 
unity and its legitimate and democratic government. For his 
part, the brother member of the Presidential Council thanked the 
government of Eritrea for its support for unity, legitimacy, and 
democracy. 
  The brother member of the Presidential Council also received 
today (Somo Tiama), the Japanese ambassador in Sanaa, who 
expressed the Japanese Government's concern about what is 
happening in Yemen. He said his country supports unity, 
democracy, and legitimacy, hoping that calm will soon return to 
the Yemeni Republic. 
  The Presidential Council member thanked the Japanese 
Government for its support of unity and democracy and 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani today also met with Arthur 
Hughes, the ambassador of the United States in Sanaa. They 
discussed the cultural background of nations and the need for 
dialogue between the peoples of the world that creates 
understanding and introduces people to each other. 
  The brother member of the Presidential Council spoke about 
the crisis, its stages, and the domestic and foreign efforts 
made to resolve it to safeguard peace and stability. He noted, 
however, that the rebel elements in the Socialist Party led the 
country to war and rejected all the concessions made to preserve 
unity and democracy. These elements insisted on departing from 
legitimacy and democracy and worked for secession and ignited 
war everywhere. 
  The U.S. ambassador expressed his country's support for 
Yemen's unity and legitimate, democratic government. He 
expressed hope that the crisis will come to an end and security 
and stability will prevail. He also noted the importance of 
dialogue between different cultures and civilizations.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F>
Naji al-Harazi and Hammud Munsir in Sanaa, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Sadiqi in Abu-Dhabi, Muhammad Sadiq in Washington, and 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden and Cairo: "Shaykh Zayid 
Holds Salih Responsible for the Continuation of the War"] 
  [Excerpt] As the fierce fighting intensifies between the 
northern and southern forces on the al-'Anad-Kirsh and 
al-Dali'-al-Rahidah fronts, it seems that the military 
operations launched by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
from Sanaa have reached red lines which cannot be crossed and 
that the situation now makes it necessary for the Arab and 
international powers to take a clear stand. Signs of such a 
stand have come from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in holding 
President Salih responsible for the continuation of the war. A 
number of Yemeni leaderships have meanwhile considered a number 
of options including secession. 
  UAE diplomatic sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that UAE 
President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly stated the 
UAE's position to the Yemeni president in a telephone 
conversation with him the day before yesterday, and said that he 
"regrets the Yemeni president's failure to respond to repeated 
appeals for a cease-fire." 
  The sources added that the UAE frankly stated its position 
because "it has no common borders with Yemen and no direct 
interest, and, therefore, being frank on the Yemeni conflict 
does not place any political or diplomatic burdens on it and 
would not leave room for anyone to doubt the UAE's goodwill and 
objectivity." 
  The sources hope that the UAE position will be an incentive 
for a number of other Arab states who are reluctant to declare 
"a frank position on the crisis to follow the example of the UAE 
as a way of putting pressure on Sanaa to agree to a cease-fire." 
They also said that although the UAE was the first Gulf state 
to sound the alarm, Shaykh Zayid "is still willing to make every 
sincere and true effort to contain the situation, prevent 
deterioration, and settle the dispute through dialogue in favor 
of the Yemeni people's interests and stability." 
  Shaykh Zayid emphasized that "dialogue is the only way to 
settle the Yemeni crisis. Yemen's interests must come before 
all other considerations." 
  Observers saw indications of the UAE position in the 
noticeable attention given to the visit of Salih Abu-Bakr 
Bin-Husaynun, the Yemeni oil and mineral resources minister who 
went there as an envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice president 
and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
compared with the cool official reception accorded to Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah who went there as an envoy of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the announcement of the 
Higher Salvation Council in Aden the day before yesterday came 
after comprehensive discussions by the leaders of the YSP and 
five other Yemeni opposition parties with the participation of 
30 House of Representatives members from the southern and 
eastern governorates. The discussions covered five main points 
relating to the current options in the Yemen arena, as follows: 
  1. Appeal to the Arab kings and presidents, the United 
Nations, and the world's parliaments to intervene to stop the 
fighting, spare Yemeni blood, and prevent fragmentation of the 
Yemeni homeland. 
  2. Announce partition and restoration of south Yemen's 
independent international identity. 
  3. Ask a committee of deputies to visit some Arab and 
foreign capitals and UN centers to inform the world of the 
deputies' support for the YSP leadership. 
  4. Draw attention to the dangers of the emergence of a 
regime that supports forces which violate Arab consensus and 
forces of extremism. 
  5. Reaffirm the importance of the southern patriotic forces' 
determination to resist the northern invasion of the southern 
governorates. 
  The YSP leadership in Aden, however, has disclosed that it 
is 
currently studying a number of political options, especially 
mobilizing national support in the north and the south for the 
preservation of the unity state, and international support 
against the "alleged legitimacy which is in fact seeking to 
destroy that unity state and destroy all chances of a better 
future for the Yemeni people." 
  A responsible source at the U.S. State Department has 
confirmed that the United States "supports the efforts of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and the Arab League to stop the 
fighting and settle the Yemeni crisis." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] According to reports, in the ongoing battles in 
Yemen the two warring factions are using modern types of weapons 
that were not previously in the Yemeni arsenal. Our information 
confirms that the value of the weapons that have entered Yemen 
recently totals $1 billion and that these weapons have flowed 
into Yemen from various U.S., European, and Israeli arms 
companies. The reports say that Israel exploited the 
complications of the Yemeni crisis and shipped these weapons to 
Yemen via several African countires, including Uganda and Zaire. 
  Reports also say that there are secret alliances between 
certain Yemeni tribes and Israeli military personnel stationed 
in these African countries. The reports add that an Israeli 
military committee left for a tour of these countries early in 
February where they met with Yemeni tribal leaders. Under an 
agreement reached between the two parties, these Yemeni figures 
became responsible for shipping the arms to Yemen across Yemeni 
borders with certain Arab countries. The reports say that $2.1 
billion has flowed into Yemen from abroad with the aim of 
consolidating the division. 
  The reports affirm that the Pledge and Accord Document which 
was signed in Amman on 20 February raised deep concern among 
foreign circles opposed to Yemeni unity. The Israeli Cabinet 
studied the Document on 28 February and realized that it augers 
well for Yemeni unity. They therefore considered that it posed 
a danger to Israeli security in the Red Sea and the Horn of 
Africa and that Yemeni unity might affect Israeli movements in 
the Red Sea littoral countries in Africa.

<F P=106> [By Tolle Aram] </F>
  [Text] Salah al-Din, Iraq, May 19 (AFP) -- Heavy fighting 
has erupted between the two main Kurdish groups in northern Iraq 
ending a 10-day truce, Kurdish officials said Thursday. 
  Clashes, which broke out on Wednesday in the town of Kou 
Senjaq, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the city of Irbil, 
in the east of Iraqi Kurdistan, were reported to be spreading to 
nearby areas on Thursday. 
  The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani 
and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mas'ud Barzani 
accused each other of starting the battle. No casualty toll has 
so far been issued. 
  Northern Iraq has been under PUK and KDP control since an 
uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army at the end 
of the Gulf war in February 1991. 
  Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said 
to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to Husayn, 
accused the PUK of breaching the May 8 ceasefire agreement in a 
statement to AFP. 
  The INC-brokered agreement ended two weeks of fighting in 
which at least 100 people were killed, and which caused the 
Kurdish region to split with the KDP controlling the western 
part and the PUK the eastern part. 
  Under the ceasefire accord INC militiamen could control 
check- points in the Irbil province lying between areas held by 
the KDP and the PUK. 
  "PUK troops came down the hill and took our checkpoint by 
force, and after that the KDP started to fight back," Ahmad 
Muhammad Nasiriyah, a Moslem Shiite from the southern Iraqi city 
of al-Nasiriyah, told AFP. 
  He said the clashes forced him and two fellow Moslem Shiites 
to flee the checkpoint and cross the fighting area on foot 
waving the INC flag. 
  The United Nations on Monday warned the PUK and KDP that 
further armed feuding might halt international aid to the Kurds. 
  The renewed battles came as the PUK accused Iranian 
militiamen of having fought against its forces in previous 
clashes, saying one Iranian fighter was captured. 
  PUK spokesman Muhammad Tawfiq said an undetermined number of 
Iranian Revolution Guards, or Pasdarans, had crossed the 
Iraq-Iran border and fought in the nearby Iraqi Kurdish villages 
of Halabjah and Qal'at Dizah. 
  The allegations were strongly denied by KDP spokesman Bruska 
Shaways.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Kurdistan Parliament is a 
civilized accomplishment. It must remain a symbol of democracy 
and accord in Kurdistan. The two years since the election of 
this parliament have been rife with a series of malicious plots 
and intrigues concocted by the enemies of our Kurdish people. 
It succeeded in confronting all these problems through sincere 
and arduous efforts and appropriate decisions. 
  The current stage puts historic responsibilities on 
Parliament, responsibilities that require it to play an 
effective role in unifying the views of the two main parties in 
Kurdistan: The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] and the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] and to do all it can to 
normalize the situation. 
  Our final word is that the masses of Kurdistan elected the 
Parliament and trust in it. Anyone who believes in the masses 
and respects their aspirations will believe in the Parliament, 
respect its sanctity, have recourse to it, and consider working 
through it to be a civilized way of overcoming problems and 
warding off dangers.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasir Mutawalli: "Meeting Harvest Operations </F>
Deadlines Is Basis for Assessing Performance of Campaign 
Workers"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture has announced new 
guidelines which the Higher Committee has approved for the wheat 
and barley harvest campaign this season to guarantee the 
fulfillment of the tasks of this national campaign at the fixed 
deadlines. 
  Announcing this to AL-THAWRAH, a source in the Ministry 
explained that the new guidelines oblige owners of harvesters to 
operate 18 hours daily. The guidelines also call on the central 
committees in the governorates to ensure the appropriate number 
of harvester drivers in order to maintain the continuity of work 
during the set daily hours, and to also provide the necessary 
repair and maintenance work. 
  The source explained that daily payments for campaign 
workers 
will stop on the set deadline and that any further delay in the 
harvest will be without pay. The performance of campaign 
workers will be assessed on the basis of meeting the deadlines. 
  The guidelines also oblige those concerned to ensure the 
necessary means for transporting crops, such as vehicles, and to 
avoid using harvesters for loading purposes since this will 
waste time and affect the efficiency of the harvester.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
has wondered: If the entry of the Yemeni forces into Aden is 
viewed as occupation, how will we view the bringing of U.S. 
forces to Arab land to strike at the pulsating heart of Arabism? 
  In an article today, the newspaper says: We are with Yemen's 
unity. We reject secession, which means separation of part of 
the nation, which badly needs that part in the current 
atmosphere of conspiracy, defeatism, and subservience to 
foreigners. 
  The newspaper criticizes statements by Husni Mubarak, 
president of the Egyptian regime, who is fishing in murky water 
and trying to escalate Arab crises and undermine Yemeni unity by 
spreading despairing ideas, feeding differences, and widening 
the gap among the Arabs. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH points out that one of the aims of the 
president of the Egyptian regime is to peddle the U.S.-Saudi 
plan to partition Yemen in order to win U.S. and Saudi goodwill. 
  He also tries to portray the situation in the Arab homeland 
as unstable and fragile in order to cover up his internal crisis 
and the growing national opposition against his regime, which is 
founded on precarious balance. 
  The newspaper explains that by this position, Husni Mubarak 
is taking revenge against Yemen for its national and pan-Arab 
stand during the immortal Mother of Battles, for its rejection 
of the foreign occupation of the Gulf region and the Arabian 
Peninsula, for its support for Iraq's principled position, and 
for its adherence to a solution within the Arab home. All this, 
the paper says, conflicts with Husni Mubarak's position. 
  Concluding, the newspaper says: These goals remind us of 
Husni Mubarak's attempts during the 30-state aggression against 
Iraq, when he hastened to hold an Arab summit conference in 
Cairo to abort the Arab solution and give legitimacy to bringing 
the invasion forces to the region to strike lofty Iraq and its 
people.

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "Who Did It Then?!"] </F>
  [Text] The Saudi regime's foreign minister has said the 
Arab Gulf states have been surprised by the military 
developments in Yemen, and he called on northern and southern 
Yemenis to end the fighting!! 
  We believe that some Gulf states may indeed have been 
surprised by the military developments in Yemen, but certainly 
not the Saudi regime. Because we are certain it is behind those 
developments. The Saudi regime has played a major role in 
plotting against Yemeni unity and fostering the secondary and 
marginal differences and disputes which have led to these 
military developments! 
  The Saudi regime, which has fought the Yemeni revolution 
since the first hours of its outbreak and cannot bear to see one 
unified, progressive, and developed Yemeni Republic, cannot but 
conspire against Yemeni unity and encourage war and rebellion 
against legitimacy. 
  When one of the Yemeni unity sides turns to Riyadh and other 
Arab and western capitals, and goes to the Saudi capital in 
search of "guarantees" for unity, as he claimed at the time, 
when he was probably looking for assistance and support for what 
he planned and had in mind, it is only natural for the 
reactionary, hostile Saudi regime to exploit Arab unity in 
general, and Yemeni unity in particular, and to fully exploit 
its relationship with that side in order to make secession look 
attractive and to instigate that side to escalate the crisis and 
ignite the fire of war and sedition. 
  Sa'ud al-Faysal has lied twice: First, when he claimed that 
they were surprised by the military developments in Yemen, 
because it was his regime which created the atmosphere and paved 
the way for these developments; and second, when he called on 
northerners and southerners to end the fighting, because his 
regime is interested in the continuation of the war more than 
anyone else in order to exhaust and weaken the Yemeni Republic 
and waste its military and economic resources.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Shlomo Ganor and Yoni Ben-Menahem in the studio on 19 May -- 
recorded, in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the 
Hebrew] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ganor] What about a Syrian 
early warning station in the Galilee? Could such a thing be 
acceptable to Israel? 
  [Beilin] Look, I cannot get into detail. Someone has taken 
something out of context or made something up. There will be 
many such reports. I think that what is important is that U.S. 
shuttle diplomacy is working and I very much hope that it will 
continue at an accelerated pace. If it does not continue I see 
no possibility of reaching an agreement because the Syrians 
refuse to hold Oslo or Camp David style talks with us. If 
things continue at the present pace, then I believe agreement is 
possible and then all these details will be explained in the 
course of negotiations. 
  [Ben-Menahem] But there are five Syrian conditions. What is 
Israel's reaction to these conditions? 
  [Beilin] Look, I do not want to discuss the actual 
negotiations. Although everything is very public, it is very 
important to keep the details secret because negotiations become 
impossible once everything becomes public. The five conditions 
published in AL-HAYAH apparently are not really Syria's 
conditions, and I would not like to juxtapose Israel's stands 
against some newspaper leak -- whether accurate or not -- of the 
Syrian position. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Why hold these shuttle trips? Why not 
establish a secret negotiating track as we did in Oslo? 
  [Beilin] Because the Syrians refuse to do so. That is the 
only reason. I think that if one wants to hold serious 
negotiations it is very important to keep things secret. Then 
you do not have media or psychological pressures on either side. 
Nor must one point to a breakthrough in every single round of 
talks. To my great regret, the Syrians refuse to make such a 
move. If I had to choose between not holding negotiations at 
all or having these shuttle missions by U.S. officials in 
parallel with the bilateral negotiations in Washington, then I 
think we have to accept the continuation of U.S. diplomacy. 
  [Ganor] You keep stressing the U.S. role, especially that of 
the secretary of state in these shuttle missions. What should 
Warren Christopher do now in order to put the Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations on a more practical track? 
  [Beilin] This decision is a matter of great importance. Out 
of more than 70 international conflicts, this is one with a 
better chance for resolution. He should be here more often, he 
should travel between Damascus and Jerusalem. If this is done, 
I am sure that we shall reach a solution because, in my opinion, 
the major problems have already been resolved now that the 
Syrians have finally expressed their readiness to talk about 
peace with Israel and Israel is finally prepared after quite a 
few years to speak of withdrawal with regard to the Golan 
Heights. 
  [Ganor] Do you expect the secretary of state to visit the 
region more frequently? 
  [Beilin] I would very much hope that these visits not always 
come at the tail end of other visits. In other words, as some 
kind of way to cap other visits to Europe or Turkey. I think it 
is important that the Americans consider this a central foreign 
policy issue. Something they can start work on and resolve. 
  [Ben-Menahem] There were reports this week that Christopher 
applied some sort of pressure on Syrian President al-Asad. Do 
you really think the Americans can pressure Syria in a way that 
can accelerate the process? 
  [Beilin] Look, the question is how you define pressure. 
According to the reports and I have received no confirmation of 
them -- he simply told the Syrians that if they could not answer 
his questions he would wash his hands of the matter. The only 
U.S. pressure I can discern here is a lack of involvement in the 
process. They did not threaten to stop helping some party or to 
harm someone else. I do not particularly believe in this theory 
of U.S. pressure. In Oslo, we proved that we could reach a very 
interesting and far-reaching agreement without any U.S. 
involvement, and I also think there is no need for any U.S. 
pressure either on Syria or on Israel. I think that what is 
needed is for the United States to devote time to this issue, 
because without the Americans there will be no peace with Syria. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Ben-Menahem] Mr. Beilin, you have voiced great 
expectations from Christopher's shuttle missions. Do you still 
believe that peace with Syria is attainable in 1994? 
  [Beilin] It all depends on the rate of progress. If things 
are accelerated, many rounds of talks will be held, and we will 
be able to exchange views with the Syrians. Then I think that 
peace will be achievable in 1994. If, on the other hand, the 
meetings and visits by U.S. officials come every two months then 
we can simply forget about it. 
  [Ganor] What must first happen in order to realize your more 
optimistic assessment? 
  [Beilin] What I am saying is quite simple and based on my 
own personal experience from the talks with the Jordanians and 
Palestinians six, seven, and eight years ago. When the 
negotiations were not direct but rather conducted through the 
Americans we were totally dependent on their tempo. When the 
Americans could afford to devote a lot of time to the politics 
of the region, things made very rapid progress. If you recall, 
there were the 10 points with Jordan in 1986 and other things 
that the Americans -- at the time Richard Murphy was especially 
involved in the political process -- pushed very quickly. 
Whenever they were forced to devote their attention to other 
matters, the peace process ground to a halt. I must admit that 
there is an unpleasant dependency on the United States. We must 
fight for an important place on the U.S. agenda. The more time 
Washington devotes to the Middle East, the greater the chances 
of peace. 
  [Ganor] Nevertheless, Mr. Beilin, if Jerusalem declares that 
it is prepared to withdraw from the Golan Heights, then progress 
can be made, at least from the Syrian point of view. 
  [Beilin] First of all, I am not sure. I do not know. Do 
you believe we will rapidly establish peace if we make such a 
declaration tomorrow? I would not bet on it. So far, I have 
found some elements of Syria's policy quite baffling. The fact 
is that up to this very moment, Syria has not fully detailed its 
concept of the nature of peace and whether it includes 
diplomatic and economic relations, open borders, and so forth. 
I, however, do not believe we shall issue such a declaration. 
Our declaration that the depth of withdrawal on the Golan 
Heights will correspond to the depth of peace with Syria is the 
most far-reaching and comprehensive statement that Israel can 
make before launching negotiations. I am not proposing that 
Syria and Israel accept the other party's position before the 
negotiations start. 
  [Ganor] But you are not ruling out the possibility that 
Jerusalem may declare its readiness to relinquish the Golan 
Heights in the course of the negotiations? 
  [Beilin] I hope this will not be the case. I hope we can 
reach an arrangement with Syria while giving up as little as 
possible of the Golan Heights. At any rate, whatever agreement 
is eventually reached will have to be brought before the people 
in a national referendum and the people will decide whether they 
are willing to pay the price for peace with Syria, which by 
definition will not be an easy one, or actually to pay the price 
for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East because currently 
the Syrians are the most problematic element in the Arab world 
vis a vis Israel. An agreement with them means diplomatic 
relations with Lebanon, Jordan, the Gulf states and most of the 
Maghreb countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] I understand you were surprised by 
Ambassador Djerejian's resignation. 
  [Beilin] I admit I was very surprised, and up to this moment 
I have not been officially informed about it. I understand from 
the media that it is final, and if that is so, then it is very 
problematic and very regrettable from our viewpoint due to his 
short tenure and Djerejian's importance in the political process. 
  [Zissowitz] Did you not detect a short circuit between 
Djerejian and his State Department bosses in Washington? 
  [Beilin] I do not think there was anything like that, anyway 
I did not know about anything like that. According to the 
report from Washington, it was not due to any internal problem, 
but because he has received an outside offer he could not turn 
down. 
  [Zissowitz] Djerejian was meant to have a central role in 
the talks with the Syrians, and will be missed, if only due to 
the fact that he was ambassador in Damascus and knew al-Asad. 
  [Beilin] That is true. He made a very important 
contribution. We had a very interesting situation in which our 
ambassador, Itamar Rabinovich, also heads the talks with Syria 
and is an expert on Syria. The U.S. ambassador in Israel was 
previously ambassador in Syria, and then assistant secretary for 
Near Eastern affairs. The fact that the two played a role in 
the political process was very, very important for the shuttle 
diplomacy commenced by the secretary of state. That is why we 
so much regret his apparent decision to resign. 
  [Zissowitz] Could it impair, spoil the negotiations with the 
Syrians? 
  [Beilin] No, it cannot hamper the negotiations, but he made 
a contribution, which will cease with his departure. It cannot 
harm or deeply hinder the political process, which at the moment 
depends to a certain extent on U.S. readiness to enhance its 
efforts in the shuttle between the two sides in view of the 
existing gaps and the positive basis existing between them. 
  [Zissowitz] How would you define the situation in the talks 
with the Syrians? 
  [Beilin] I would say that the shared principle of peace and 
territories is very firm, as never before, and it gives me hope 
that we will have a peace accord within months and not years. 
The separate positions appear to be very far apart, therefore 
there is an optically distorted picture of gaps that cannot be 
bridged. I believe the gaps can be bridged, and I think it is 
the U.S. Administration that can bridge those gaps, because at 
the moment, I do not see a better channel for talks between us 
and them, especially since the Syrians are still unprepared for 
talks between the two sides on a senior political level. 
Therefore, in addition to the resumption of the bilateral talks 
in Washington, U.S. shuttle diplomacy will have a role in 
closing the gaps. That is why I am optimistic, and anything 
that harms the chance to succeed in that diplomacy, such as 
Djerejian's announcement, is regrettable. 
  [Zissowitz] Djerejian served as ambassador here only a short 
time. Would you call him a friend of Israel? 
  [Beilin] I do not know if we can use that expression.... 
  [Zissowitz, interrupting] We usually like to stick those 
titles on people. 
  [Beilin] I have my own formula. I say that whoever is a 
friend of peace is a friend of Israel, and Djerejian definitely 
was a friend of peace. I also think that he can be seen as a 
personal friend of many among us. The man was very informed. I 
met him almost 10 years ago when he began his post as head of 
the Israel desk in the State Department, and then in other 
posts, including ambassador in Syria, and assistant secretary 
for Near Eastern affairs, and in all those roles he made an 
important contribution to the political process. In his 
previous position, he headed their team in the multilateral 
talks, and together we advanced those talks beyond their poor 
start and made them into something much more significant. He is 
one of the most knowledgeable people on the Middle East in the 
State Department, and there are not many others like him. That 
is why his move is a blow to us. In order to find somebody to 
replace Djerejian as ambassador in Israel they will have to 
search far and wide in the State Department for somebody with 
his level of expertise, knowledge, and familiarity. 
  [Zissowitz] Will Israel ask that the appointment be made as 
soon as possible? 
  [Beilin] I assume that is a top American interest. We will 
not intervene in the selection of the person or the timing, but 
it is obvious that in the very intensive relations between us 
and the Americans, neither of us can permit long interruptions.

  [Text] Two soldiers were killed this morning south of the 
Erez junction when shot by terrorists from a vehicle which left 
the Gaza Strip and returned there following the shooting. The 
fatalities were reservists. One soldier was named as Moshe 
Bukhra of Netanya, while the name of the other fatality has not 
yet been released. 
  The soldiers were deployed with a third soldier at a 
temporary roadblock south of the Erez junction when a Peugeot 
car suddenly appeared from the south and opened fire at them. 
The two soldiers died on the spot while the third managed to 
return fire at the assailants. The vehicle returned to the Gaza 
Strip. No chase was given because there were no additional IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] soldiers there. 
  The representative of the Palestinian police force in the 
Gaza Strip told AP by telephone that the Palestinian police 
force did not open fire, and said that from the point of view of 
the Palestinian authorities in the Gaza Strip the incident is 
over. 
  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad 
claim responsibility for the attack. Hamas said in 
announcements made in Gaza mosques that the assailants belonged 
to 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam. A different announcement made to the 
foreign press in the Gaza Strip said they belonged to the 
Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says Israel 
cannot countenance a situation in which terrorists escape into 
the autonomous areas after an attack and the Palestinian 
authorities do not take steps to apprehend them. In an 
interview with reporter Jack Katzenell, Beilin said the 
Palestinian administration is still in diapers, but it must 
disarm the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists. 
Today's terrorists' attacks were both sad and serious, Beilin 
said. 
  [Begin Beilin recording] It is sad because of the people who 
were killed and injured, and it is serious also because of the 
fact that the Palestinians did not react properly to this event. 
What they have to do is to claim responsibility to assure that 
they are doing their utmost in order to disarm those people, and 
to pursue them, and to find them. The difficulties are there, 
we know that, we don't dismiss it, but it is now the duty of the 
Palestinian police to deal with the matter, to find the people, 
and to do whatever possible in order to prevent a recurrence of 
those events in the future. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The opposition has reacted sharply to the 
attacks in the Gaza Strip. The National Religious Party has 
called on the public to rise up and prevent what it terms the 
government head-long dive into the abyss. The head of Tzomet, 
Refa'el Eytan, says the attacks are the inevitable outcome of a 
government that ordered the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to flee 
Gaza, in his words, in the middle of the night. 
  The YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] party is 
demanding that the prime minister halt the passage of all 
vehicles from Gaza into Israeli territory. A short time ago, 
reporter Harley Braidman got this reaction from the senior Likud 
member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Eliyahu 
Ben-Elisar: 
  [Begin Ben-Elisar recording] This is a tragedy because again 
everybody can see what a catastrophe was bestowed upon us by a 
government which is blind and weak, and is pursuing a policy 
which could not succeed, could have no chance of succeeding 
because it is against nature, and against human character and 
mentality. How can a foreign and powerful nation like Israel 
try to strike a peace agreement with a snake, with 'Arafat, with 
the PLO, and believe that this is the only way out of the 
difficulties, and trust such a man, who is not being trusted by 
his Arab colleagues? Believe me, I know what I am saying.

  [Text] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur says that 
there are doubts about the implementation of autonomy. There 
have been shooting incidents with casualties, and there is a 
feeling that the situation is unclear and that working patterns 
have as yet to be established. The deputy defense minister made 
these observations during a visit to the Qatif Bloc on the first 
day of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment. 
  Our Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 
referring to 'Arafat's remarks in South Africa, Deputy Minister 
Gur said the PLO chief's conduct was beyond any political or 
human ethics, and was inexcusable. He did not believe, however, 
that the agreement was in any danger. 
  Tzvi Handel, head of the Hof 'Aza Regional Council, told the 
deputy minister that a car stolen yesterday from the Eley Sinai 
settlement was today found in the possession of a Palestinian 
policeman.

  [Text] The coalition is recruiting all its members prior 
to the no-confidence motions that will be heard on Monday [23 
May]. The United Torah Jewry [UTJ] has submitted a no-confidence 
motion over the desecration of the Sabbath and holidays during 
the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip. The Likud submitted a motion of no confidence because 
because it alleges that the government is prepared to hold 
negotiations over the future of Jerusalem.
